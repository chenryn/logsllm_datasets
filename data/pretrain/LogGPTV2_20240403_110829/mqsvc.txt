### Message Queuing (MQ) Service

Message Queuing (MQ) technology facilitates communication between applications that may be running at different times, even across heterogeneous networks and systems that might be temporarily offline. MQ ensures reliable message delivery, efficient routing, robust security, and priority-based messaging. This technology can be utilized for both asynchronous and synchronous messaging scenarios.

#### Key Features
- **Guaranteed Message Delivery:** Ensures that messages are delivered reliably, even if the network or system is temporarily unavailable.
- **Efficient Routing:** Routes messages to their intended destinations in an optimized manner.
- **Security:** Provides mechanisms to secure the transmission of messages.
- **Priority-Based Messaging:** Allows messages to be processed based on their assigned priority levels.

For more detailed information about Message Queuing, refer to the documentation on [Message Queuing (MSMQ)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/msmq/message-queuing-overview).

#### Syntax
To manage the Message Queuing service, use the following command:
```sh
mqsvc.exe
