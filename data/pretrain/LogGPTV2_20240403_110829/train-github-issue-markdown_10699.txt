**Issue with Adding Alerts and Reports in Apache Superset**

I have followed the documentation from the link below to set up the email configuration for Apache Superset:
- [Email Reports Configuration](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/email-reports)

I have enabled alerts by setting `ENABLE_ALERTS = True` in the configuration file. I am using Apache Superset version 1.0.0, released on January 21, 2021.

The email scheduling feature is working correctly. However, I am unable to add any alerts or reports because the "Add" button is grayed out and non-functional.

Could you please assist me in resolving this issue?

Thank you.
