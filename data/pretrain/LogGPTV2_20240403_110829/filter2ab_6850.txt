### Title: BlackHat EU-19: Novel Exploit Technique in Java Deserialization Attacks

#### Abstract:
Java deserialization attacks were first highlighted by the Foxglove Security Team in 2015. Since then, another significant attack vector, known as the Marshalsec Attack, has emerged. This technique allows attackers to achieve Remote Command Execution (RCE) and has affected a wide range of applications, making it one of the most critical security issues in Java's history.

Many security researchers and developers have attempted to mitigate these attacks by maintaining a deserialization blacklist. For instance, WebLogic maintains a constantly updated blacklist to prevent deserialization attacks. However, finding exploitable gadget chains that can lead to RCE remains challenging.

In this presentation, we will introduce a newly discovered flaw in Java deserialization from a different perspective. We have identified a new attack vector within the fundamental classes of the JDK, which is prevalent in many Java applications. This includes widely used libraries such as `URLClassLoader`, official HTTP request classes, and the Apache HTTP client.

By combining this new attack vector with previously unknown gadget chains, we have been able to bypass existing blacklists and achieve RCE. Our in-depth research involved analyzing over 10,000 Java third-party libraries, revealing numerous real-world exploitable scenarios.

During the talk, we will delve into the principles and techniques behind these vulnerabilities. We will also demonstrate how to exploit a target server using our novel technique. This approach not only enhances the effectiveness of Java deserialization vulnerabilities but also amplifies the impact of other Java security issues. Additionally, we will discuss the profound implications of this attack vector on the broader Java security landscape.
