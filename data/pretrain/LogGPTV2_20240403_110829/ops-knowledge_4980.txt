User: Please explain what is system load balancing and what are the common load balancing algorithms?
Assistant: System load balancing refers to the technology of distributing access requests to multiple servers to achieve load balancing. Its main role is to prevent a single server from slowing down or crashing due to too many requests. The specific implementation manner may be completed based on hardware devices, software or services. Common load balancing algorithms are as follows: 1. Round Robin: Assign each request to different servers in sequence, such as server 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3... 2 . Least Connections algorithm (Least Connections): The load balancer will check the current number of connections of each server, and assign the request to the server with the least current number of connections. 3. IP Hash Algorithm (IP Hash): The load balancer assigns the request to the server corresponding to the IP address according to the requested IP address. 4. URL Hash Algorithm (URL Hash): The load balancer assigns the request to the server corresponding to the URL address according to the requested URL address. 5. Weighted Round Robin: Configure different weights for each server, that is, assign different request ratios. 6. Weighted Least Connections algorithm (Weighted Least Connections): On the basis of the least connections algorithm, configure different weights for each server. Different algorithms are suitable for different scenarios and requirements, and need to be selected according to the actual situation.
