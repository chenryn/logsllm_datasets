    Shodan is the search engine to use if you are looking for specific
    types of IoT, including webcams, routers, or servers mostly running
    HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet, SNMP, IMAP, SMTP, and SIP. Shodan
    users can find all sorts of fun things connected to the Internet.
    Everything from traffic lights, control systems, power grids,
    security cameras, and even a nuclear power plant or two have been
    found. Many of these IoT devices still have their default
    configuration on them, such as `admin/admin`, and the only software
    needed to connect is your web browser.
    In [Figure
    11.6](#c11.xhtml#c11-fig-0006){#c11.xhtml#R_c11-fig-0006}, you see
    the search for `www.example.com`. Shodan.io crawls the Internet for
    publicly accessible devices. With your search, you will get 10
    results unless you create an account. If you sign in, you can get up
    to 50.

## DNS {#c11.xhtml#head-2-83}
I believe having a solid understanding of the hierarchical naming system
for anything connected to the Internet will make your security tasks
easier. DNS stands for Domain Name System. Since 1985, DNS has been an
essential component []{#c11.xhtml#Page_154 .pagebreak title="154"
role="doc-pagebreak"}of the Internet. It provides a global, distributed
directory service. It coordinates information with domain names assigned
to a numerical IP address. It is much harder for us as humans to
remember the four octets for every website we want to visit. It is much
easier to remember `www.example.com`.
There are 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses. It would be very difficult to
build and maintain a database of all those IPv4 addresses in just one
place. With the addition of the
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 IPv6 addresses, it
is mind‐boggling. It is estimated there are 7.7 billion people on Earth.
That is more than a trillion IP addresses assigned to every single
person on this planet. We need a way to track all these addresses.
Actually, we have to delegate this process to a system.
The DNS is going to share the responsibility of assigning domain names
and mapping those names by designating authoritative name servers for
each domain. A name server is going to respond to questions asked about
names in a certain zone. This server should only respond to questions
about domain names that are specifically configured by a network
administrator. This allows this process to be distributed and be fault
tolerant. Could you imagine what would happen should one single point of
failure bring down the naming system for the entire Internet?
The most common types of records are going to be the Start of Authority
(SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchange (MX), name servers
(NS), and Domain Name Aliases (CNAME). The CNAME is also called the
*canonical name*. It can point `www.example.com` and `ftp.example.com`
to the right DNS entry for `example.com`, which has an A record, which
is the IP address.
The term *DNS zone* refers to a certain portion or space within the
global system. There is a boundary of authority subject to management,
which is represented by a zone. DNS zones are organized like a tree
according to the hierarchy of cascading lower‐level domains. In [Figure
11.7](#c11.xhtml#c11-fig-0007){#c11.xhtml#R_c11-fig-0007}, you see an
example of a DNS zone domain namespace.
![[**[Figure 11.7](#c11.xhtml#R_c11-fig-0007){#c11.xhtml#c11-fig-0007
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} The domain namespace of
`example.com`](Images/c11f007.jpg){.center width="645" height="303"}
[]{#c11.xhtml#Page_155 .pagebreak title="155" role="doc-pagebreak"}A DNS
zone transfer is the process where a DNS server passes part of its
database to another DNS server. There is a master DNS server and one or
more slave DNS servers so you can have more than one DNS server able to
answer questions about a particular zone. A basic DNS zone transfer
attack is to pretend you\'re a slave DNS server and ask the master for a
copy. A best practice is to restrict zone transfers. At the minimum,
tell the master the IP addresses of the slaves so they don\'t share
information with an impersonator.

## Defense in Depth {#c11.xhtml#head-2-84}
If you have ever toured a well‐engineered medieval castle, you have
walked through a defense in depth. The ultimate goal is to keep the bad
guys out. You have to cross a moat and get through the outer portcullis,
and the castle itself is usually in a well‐defended place on a cliff
somewhere with high walls and arrow slits in the wall for archers.
Individuals who do web development should think about their processes of
defense in the same manner.
The personal information and intellectual proprietary information need
to be hosted in the most innermost, protected area of the castle so that
if attackers get over the moat, they still have not been able to get the
keys to the kingdom. There are several mechanisms you can put in place
that will protect web applications. Most web applications use the
authentication, session management, and access control triad to reduce
their attack surface. They have interdependencies, providing overall
protection. Any defect in any part of the triad could possibly give an
attacker access to the data.
Authentication is the most basic where you have to prove you are who you
say you are by logging into a site. After you log in with a strong
password or multifactor authentication, the authenticated person\'s
session must be managed. This is usually done with some sort of token.
When a user gets a token, the browser submits it to the server in each
subsequent HTTP request. If the user is not active, the token will
ideally expire requiring that user to log in again. Access control is
put in place to make and enforce who has access to what. If this has
been deployed correctly, it will know if this user is authorized to
perform an action or access the data he or she is requesting.
Even using this triad, no web application or technology has proven to be
invulnerable. New threats and techniques pop up every day that add a
dynamic element to defense. Bad guys attack and we move to defend.
Anyone who is in a development role must realize that you can maintain
security in your web applications during the actual development of those
tools. A good rule of thumb is to assume all input to be hostile. Input
validation is done so that only properly formed data can be placed in a
web application field. The next time you pull up a form, check to see
whether you can add letters in the field for a ZIP code. That field
should accept numbers only, as well as only a certain number of numbers.
[]{#c11.xhtml#Page_156 .pagebreak title="156"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Encryption is another defense mechanism whether
it\'s protecting data in transit or data at rest. You must implement an
authentication plan, but the data those services shared must be
encrypted in some way. An open, unsecured web service is a hacker\'s
best friend, and there are algorithms that can crawl the web looking for
this.
Another development‐focused security tool to implement is exception
handling. Think of the last time you mistyped your username and
password. Did the error tell you it was your username or your password?
Ideally, it should be generic. If the error message was that your
password was incorrect, hackers now know that the username was correct
and to focus their efforts on your password. In any case, the exception
or error should reject or fail closed. An application that fails
securely will prevent operations from happening that shouldn\'t.
Lastly, don\'t forget auditing and logging as well as quality assurance
and testing. Logs often record suspicious activity and can provide
individual accountability. If you can, hire a third‐party service that
specializes in penetration testing or vulnerability scanning. In
college, one of the best practices was to have another person read your
thesis. You become immune to your errors. You know what you meant to
say, but did you say it right? Getting someone with expertise to give
your application a test can make the difference between a multimillion
dollar breach and no breach at all.
I\'m lucky enough to call Chris Roberts, the Sidragon himself, a friend.
I would hate to be unlucky enough to call him an enemy. Physically
imposing, even when wearing a kilt and sporting a foot‐long blue beard,
he is one of the best security researchers out there and one of the
nicest guys you\'ll ever meet. He says, "There are those of us in the
know, we know what is going on and there are too many organizations out
there saying, 'Oh, we are perfectly safe,' but we do have a hell of a
lot of people who are unaware." We have to learn and evolve.

## Burp Suite {#c11.xhtml#head-2-85}
Burp Suite is a Java‐based web penetration testing graphical tool
developed by PortSwigger Web Security. It has become an
industry‐standard suite of tools used by security professionals. There
are three versions: the community edition that can be downloaded freely
and the professional and enterprise versions that have a trial period.
Burp Suite helps you identify vulnerabilities and verify attack vectors
that are affecting your web applications. In its simplest form, Burp
Suite can be used as a proxy server, scanner, and intruder.
While browsing a target application, penetration testers can configure
their Internet browser to route traffic through the proxy server. Burp
Suite then captures and analyzes each request to and from the target web
application. This allows the interception, inspection, and possible
modification of the raw traffic. Penetration testers can pause,
manipulate, and replay individual HTTP []{#c11.xhtml#Page_157 .pagebreak
title="157" role="doc-pagebreak"}requests to analyze potential
parameters or injection points. Intruder can perform automated attacks
on web applications. The tool can configure an algorithm that makes
malicious HTTP requests as well as test for things like SQL injection
and cross‐site scripting (CSS). Certain injection points can be
specified for manual as well as automated fuzzing attacks to discover
potentially unintended application behaviors, crashes, and error
messages. Fuzzing is a technique that allows you to test software by
putting invalid or unexpected data into the computer program and monitor
the behavior.
In [Lab 11.2](#c11.xhtml#c11-fea-0002){#c11.xhtml#R_c11-fea-0002}, you
