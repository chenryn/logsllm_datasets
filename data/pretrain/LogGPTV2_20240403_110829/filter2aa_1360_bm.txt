Similar to Twitter, users can "Like" or comment on each post. Unique from Twitter, this is only seen when you 
load the target post in your browser. In other words, if a user posts a comment to a photo published by our 
target, we do not see that comment within the account of the person who made it. We only see it within the 
specific post directly from the target. We also cannot search within Instagram by keyword in order to identify 
comments, but we can with Google as explained momentarily. First, let's focus on Likes.
• 
View the source code of https://www.instagram.com/p/BKI KWEthQkb.
• 
Search "1080" within the source page.
• 
Copy the entire URL including "1080".
• 
Paste the modified URL into a browser and download die full version of the image.
Viewing an individual Instagram post reveals a heart icon below any comments. Clicking that icon "likes" the 
post from your account, so this should be avoided. Directly below the heart is a summary such as "557 Likes". 
Clicking on this opens a new window, which identifies each account that liked the post. Slowly scrolling through 
this list expands it until all accounts are present. Similar to the previous mediod of capturing friends and 
followers of a target, a manual approach is best here. Pressing "Ctrl" + "A" or "command" + "A" on the 
keyboard selects all of the content, and "Ctrl" + "C" or "command" + "C" copies it to your computer memory’, 
which can be pasted into a spreadsheet or word processor. You can repeat this process for the comments within 
the post.
If you locate a comment which is valuable to your investigation, you may want to document the date and time 
of the post. This is not available within the standard view. As an example, look at the post at 
https://www.instagram.eom/p/Bqi6r9uA0Y3. Inside the comments includes a response of "now I gotta go buy 
some beer" from a friend. At the time of this writing, Instagram displayed "102w" under the post, as seen in 
Figure 12.04, indicating it was posted 102 weeks previous to the current date. This is not sufficient for our needs. 
XXTiile on the page, right-click and choose the option to view the source code. Next, search for the terms (now 
I gotta go buy some beer) and notice the text immediately after the result, as displayed below.
Assume that you have located your suspect (https://www.instagram.com/hak5darrcn) and found an 
incriminating post on his account (https://www.instagram.eom/p/BKlKWEdiQkb). This is a high-priority’ 
investigation, and extensive manual documentation is justified. You have already’ attacked his account with 
Instaloader and Instalooter as explained in previous chapters. You possess all of the images from the account. 
The following outlines the next steps 1 would take toward this target.

You now have a spreadsheet with multiple pages inside it. The first provides the comments, details, and likes of 
a specific post. The second displays all of the target's followers. The third shows his friends, and the fourth 
provides the direct URL of every post for later analysis or extraction. Figure 12.05 displays a partial view' of my 
example, highlighting the final sheet created. This was a lot of work, and I do not replicate these steps for every 
Instagram investigation. You must decide when the extra work is warranted. Unfortunately, there is no reliable 
automated solution which extracts all data.
Opening a video page allows you to play die content and see any details such as likes and comments. Capturing 
the text data can be done using the techniques previously explained. However, saving the video introduces new 
challenges. While the video URL is embedded into the source code of the page, it requires heavy modification 
in order to replicate the content in a format which can be archived. Instead, we will rely on our browser to help 
us locate the stream. While viewing any Instagram video page, launch die "Inspector" tool widiin your Firefox 
or Chrome browser. You should be able to simply right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element". If this 
is not visible, you can launch Inspector from the Developer Tools within the browser menu.
Within Inspector, click the "Network" tab and play the video. If the video was already playing, reload the page. 
The inspector will display a lot of information which can seem overwhelming. Instead of manually filtering 
through these network connections, simply type "mp4" within the search field directly below the "Network" 
tab. This should eliminate all of the data and leave you with one URL. Right-click this URL and select "Open in 
New Tab". Figure 12.06 displays these options. The new tab within your browser should present the same video 
in full-size resolution. You can now right-click on the video and select the option to save it.

This may all seem tedious and complicated. While there are browser extensions which simplify these processes, 
they are replicating the manual methods presented here. Knowing these manual functions allows you to explain 
the capture process when mandated. When 1 testified in criminal trials about my online evidence, 1 proudly 
explained the ways 1 captured evidence from the source rather than relying on third-party tools which do not 
disclose their exact methods.
Instagram allows users to be tagged within posts. On any target profile, you may 
above the images. You can also navigate direcdy with the following structure.
an Instagram video MP4 file.
This confirms that Google indexed the post, but did not present it when I searched the suspect's Instagram 
username. This means that we should also query search terms when we conduct searches associated with a 
target The search tools presented in a moment simplifies this, but let's conduct one more manual attempt. I see 
that "hakodarren" posts comments to "snubs" within his posts. I would like to search for any Instagram posts, 
within any accounts, which contain either a mention of or comment by both "hak5darren" and "snubs". The 
following is appropriate.
We have exhausted all useful aspects of collecting data from within Instagram.com. The search functions arc 
extremely limited there, so we must utilize a third-party' search engine to find further data and connections. In 
my experience, Google is our best option, and you should be familiar with die queries conducted at the beginning 
of the chapter. Let's conduct a demonstration. Earlier, we searched sitctinstagram.com "hak5darren" and 
received 165 results. Browsing through these three pages reveals no evidence of a post including the word 
"Pager". However, I know he posted a photo with that term in the tide. Searching the following reveals the 
target post.
Many people who post to Instagram broadcast the links on Twitter. Following this data can reveal unique 
comments from Twitter users. In rare scenarios, it can reveal Instagram posts from private accounts. Posts 
themselves arc not private, only ACCOUNTS are private. If I know die exact URL of your "private" post, I 
should be able to see the content. If you post an Instagram link on your public Twitter account, that post is not

This service is very similar to the previous and should present most of the same data. My complaint with this 
option is that you are limited to three free searches each day. While InstaFollowcrs appears to offer unlimited 
search, Google Captchas during each becomes quite tiresome.
Third-part}' Instagram tools appear and disappear rapidly. After publication, 1 will continue to update the 
Instagram search tool with new features, as explained next.
Of these, Instafollowers has been the most beneficial. It was the only option which displayed "Stories 
Highlights" of previously expired content and easily allowed download of all stories directly through Instagram. 
Consider the following example. Using their search tool, 1 conducted a query for my target Several "Stories" 
were presented with a "Download" button below each. That button forwarded me directly to the Instagram host 
of each video. Each link is quite long, but should load the video directly in your browser. Right-clicking should 
present the option to download the file.
Because of these reasons, we should always check Twitter for Instagram posts. The user "hak5darren" on 
Instagram is also "hak5darren" on Twitter. The following Google search identifies posts on Twitter 
(site:twitter.com) which mention "hack5darren", and possess an Instagram image URL (instagram.com/p).
private. If you post images to Instagram and have no followers, you may post the same link to Twitter where 
you have an audience.
Overall, the various Instagram search websites do nothing more than what we replicated in the previous 
instruction. However, these sites could identify that one piece of vital evidence which we missed. Therefore, it 
is always best to have as many resources as possible. I have found the following third-part}’ resources beneficial 
to my investigations.
This site was mentioned previously in the Twitter tools. It indexes Instagram account biographies (bios) and 
makes them searchable. The bios are the brief description of the account, as provided by the user. These often 
include additional usernames, locations, interest, and contacts. A search of the term "gmail.com" within this site 
revealed 312,314 profiles which include an email address within the bio. I often use this sendee to seard 
Snapchat usernames with hopes of connecting an account to an Instagram profile.
Instagram Stories are vertical photos or videos, up to 15 seconds in length, which disappear 24 hours aftei 
posting. Instead of being displayed in the user's feed, they are displayed at the top of an active user's app when 
they are logged in. Since Stories disappear quickly, they are often used much more casually than the public 
Instagram feed. I have found the following utilities helpful for displaying and downloading this temporary 
content. 1 demonstrate each.

From an evidence perspective, I believe it is best to obtain your Instagram data from the official website. 
However, account requirements can might hinder your investigation. Some organizations prevent employees 
from using any covert account to access data about a target. If logging in to Instagram is prohibited, consider 
Dumpor. This sendee allows you to navigate through a person's Instagram posts without the need for an 
account You can search a username or tag from the main site, or submit a direct URL query as follows.
I realize this chapter presents many technical ways of acquiring Instagram user data which can be simplified with 
browser extensions and Python tools. Searching the Chrome store for Instagram extensions will provide many 
options. While 1 do not rely on these for my daily investigations, 1 understand the allure for easier solutions. If 
you want to install a browser extension which simplifies downloads of data, my preference is "Downloader for 
Instagram". After installation, you should see new download options within Instagram profiles and posts. Figure 
12.07 displays our target's profile with a new green download option in the upper right. Clicking this presents a 
menu which allows download of all photos and videos from his account.
Clicking "Download" prepares an archive of the data which is presented as a single zip file. This file contains all 
of the images and videos within die account. Figure 12.08 displays a partial result. Each file name includes the 
Instagram username and the post identifiers.
While this solution seems ideal for daily use, I have some bad news. I have witnessed suspension of Instagram 
accounts when using automated extensions such as this. Always log in to a "junk" account and expect that you 
may be blocked. Logging back in to the account and completing a Captcha usually reverses the suspension.
