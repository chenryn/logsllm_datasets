### Instagram Data Collection and Analysis

#### Engagement on Posts
Similar to Twitter, Instagram users can "Like" or comment on each post. However, unlike Twitter, these interactions are only visible when you load the specific post in your browser. This means that if a user comments on a photo published by another user, the comment will not appear in the commenter's account; it will only be visible within the specific post.

#### Keyword Search Limitations
Instagram does not support keyword searches for comments, but you can use Google to search for specific terms. Let's start by focusing on "Likes."

#### Extracting Full-Resolution Images
1. View the source code of the Instagram post (e.g., https://www.instagram.com/p/BKI KWEthQkb).
2. Search for "1080" within the source page.
3. Copy the entire URL containing "1080."
4. Paste the modified URL into your browser to download the full-resolution image.

#### Capturing Likes
- **View Individual Post**: Below the comments, you'll see a heart icon. Clicking this icon will "like" the post from your account, so avoid this action.
- **Summary of Likes**: Directly below the heart is a summary such as "557 Likes." Clicking this opens a new window listing all accounts that liked the post.
- **Scroll and Select**: Slowly scroll through the list until all accounts are loaded. Use "Ctrl" + "A" or "command" + "A" to select all content, then "Ctrl" + "C" or "command" + "C" to copy it to your clipboard.
- **Paste into Spreadsheet**: Open a spreadsheet or word processor and paste the copied data.

#### Documenting Comments
If a comment is valuable to your investigation, you may need to document the date and time of the post. For example, consider the post at https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqi6r9uA0Y3. The comment "now I gotta go buy some beer" is displayed, and Instagram shows "102w" under the post, indicating it was posted 102 weeks ago. To get the exact date and time:
1. Right-click on the page and choose "View Page Source."
2. Search for the comment text (e.g., "now I gotta go buy some beer").
3. Note the timestamp information immediately after the result.

#### High-Priority Investigation
Assume you have located a suspect (https://www.instagram.com/hak5darrcn) and found an incriminating post (https://www.instagram.com/p/BKlKWEdiQkb). You have already used tools like Instaloader and Instalooter to collect all images from the account. The next steps include:

1. **Extract Comments and Likes**:
   - Navigate to the post (https://www.instagram.com/p/BKlKWEthQkb).
   - Scroll through the comments and expand any if necessary.
   - Click the summary of likes below the heart icon.
   - Scroll until all likes are loaded, then select all with "Ctrl" + "A" or "command" + "A" and copy.
   - Open a new spreadsheet and paste the results.
   - Rename the tab "BKlKWEthQkb" and open a new tab for other posts.

2. **Extract Followers and Following**:
   - Return to the account (https://www.instagram.com/hak5darren).
   - Click "Followers," load the data, copy it, and paste it into a new sheet titled "Followers."
   - Repeat the process for "Following."

3. **Extract Post URLs**:
   - On the target profile, scroll down until all posts are loaded.
   - Select/highlight all and right-click, choose "Copy selected links," and paste the data into a new sheet titled "Posts."

#### Video Content
To save Instagram videos:
1. Open the video page and play the content.
2. Launch the "Inspector" tool in Firefox or Chrome (right-click and select "Inspect Element").
3. Click the "Network" tab and play the video. If it was already playing, reload the page.
4. Type "mp4" in the search field to filter the network connections.
5. Right-click the MP4 URL and select "Open in New Tab."
6. Right-click on the video and select "Save As" to download it.

#### Third-Party Tools
While manual methods are reliable, third-party tools can simplify the process. Some useful tools include:

- **Search My Bio (searchmy.bio)**: Indexes Instagram account biographies and makes them searchable.
- **InstaFollowers (instafollowers.co/download-instagram-stories)**: Downloads Instagram stories and highlights.
- **Ingramer (ingramer.com/tools/stories-viewer/)**: Displays and downloads Instagram stories.

#### Cross-Platform Search
- **Google Search**: Use queries like `site:instagram.com "hak5darren" "pager"` to find specific posts.
- **Twitter Search**: Use `site:twitter.com "hak5darren" "instagram.com/p"` to find Instagram posts shared on Twitter.
