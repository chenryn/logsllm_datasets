### Title: Operational Templates for State-Level Cyber Attacks and Collective Defense

The veneer of modern civilization is thin and brittle. With sufficient determination, it is alarmingly easy to systematically dismantle the functions of government and the social cohesion that binds society together. In the realm of cyberspace, state-sponsored cyber forces, electronic warfare units, and information operations teams wield immense power. When combined, these capabilities can overwhelm fragile infrastructure and disjoint defenses.

We are witnessing an ongoing and increasingly intense probing of critical infrastructure on a global scale. The trend is toward operations of escalating scope and impact, ranging from passive surveillance to disruption and even destruction. It is crucial to recognize that the groundwork has already been laid for even more aggressive attacks, and current operations serve to test and refine these capabilities.

Individual enterprises and organizations attempting to stand alone against such threats are likely to be overwhelmed. While governments can provide assistance, they often falter due to political indecisiveness, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and a short-term focus. What is needed are collective defenses that match the agility and coordination of state-level offensive techniques.

In this talk, we will explore templates for both attacking and defending nations. Militaries have long used doctrinal templates—models based on known or postulated adversary doctrines—to support traditional kinetic warfare training and operations. This approach is equally effective in cyberspace. We will provide templates detailing how threat actors could disrupt or defeat a country, considering various time horizons and levels of attribution.

By the end of this talk, you will have a playbook for understanding how nations might be attacked and defended, a methodology for creating your own templates and scenarios for defensive planning, and an enhanced awareness of our collective vulnerability. You will also gain a deeper appreciation for the necessity of teamwork in overcoming these challenges.
