User: When using Docker containers, how to solve problems such as sharing resources between containers, monitoring container status, and optimizing container performance?
Assistant: 1. Shared resources: Shared resources can be mounted as data volumes, and multiple containers can share resources by mounting the same data volume. 2. Monitor container status: You can use Docker's built-in command-line tools or third-party tools to monitor the status of Docker containers, such as the docker stats command. 3. Optimize container performance: You can optimize container performance by optimizing Docker images, modifying container configuration, and adjusting resource limits. Among them, you can use the Docker Compose file to manage the configuration information of multiple containers. 4. Use host resources in the container: You can use the mapping function provided by Docker to map the resources of the host to the container for use, such as port mapping, data volume mapping, etc. At the same time, you can also use Docker's network function to connect multiple containers to achieve communication between containers.
