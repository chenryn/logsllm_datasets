User: How to search for records with certain criteria in MySQL database?
Assistant: In a MySQL database, you can use the SELECT statement to search for records with specific criteria. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Determine the table and field to search. For example, if you want to search a table named "employees", the table contains columns "id", "name" and "age". 2. Write the SELECT statement. SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the database. For example, to search for employees in this table who are over 30 years old, you can use the following statement: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30; This will return all employee records that meet the criteria. 3. Execute the query and view the results. After the query is executed, the records meeting the condition will be returned. Results can be viewed in the MySQL console or other MySQL clients.
