User:  What is the difference between a traditional data center and a cloud data center? Please list at least three differences.
Assistant: 1. Physical facilities: Traditional data centers are usually built and maintained by enterprises themselves, while cloud data centers are dedicated or shared facilities built and managed by cloud service providers. 2. Architecture: Traditional data centers usually adopt a distributed application architecture, while cloud data centers adopt a scalable multi-tenant architecture. 3. Service model: Traditional data centers usually provide infrastructure and software for enterprises, while cloud data centers provide a wider range of service models, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) ).
