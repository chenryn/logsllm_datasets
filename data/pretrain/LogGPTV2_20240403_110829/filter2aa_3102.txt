#### Agenda
1. **Introduction**
   - 12 years in Information Security, with experience in various roles.
   - Led security consultancy and monitoring teams in Brazil, London, and the US.
   - Experienced with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions.
   - Researching machine learning and data science for the past year, actively participating in Kaggle competitions.

2. **The Monitoring Problem**
   - **Logs, Logs Everywhere:**
     - Log management and SIEM solutions.
     - Compliance and incident response.
   - **Challenges:**
     - According to Gartner's 2013 Magic Quadrant for Security Information and Event Management, over 92% of breaches go undetected by the breached organization.
     - Many organizations are re-evaluating their SIEM vendors due to partial, marginal, or failed deployments.

3. **Monitoring and Log Management Challenges**
   - SANS Eighth Annual 2012 Log and Event Management Survey Results highlight the difficulties in effective log management.
   - Finding qualified professionals who can handle these tasks is extremely challenging.
   - The need for professionals with skills in statistics, data analysis, and data science is growing.

4. **Next Steps: Big Data Technologies**
   - The demand for highly skilled professionals is increasing.
   - The transition to big data technologies requires a new approach.

5. **Machine Learning to the Rescue**
   - **What is Machine Learning?**
     - Machine learning systems automatically learn programs from data.
     - The goal is to mimic the way the brain learns, leading to terms like artificial intelligence.
   - **Applications of Machine Learning:**
     - Sales, trading, image and voice recognition.
     - Supervised Learning: Classification (e.g., Neural Networks, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes) and Regression (e.g., Linear, Logistic).
     - Unsupervised Learning: Clustering (e.g., k-means) and Decomposition (e.g., PCA, SVD).

6. **Case Study: Detecting Malicious Agents**
   - **Model Design:**
     - Utilizing firewall block data from SANS DShield.
     - Feature engineering is crucial.
   - **Model Intuition:**
     - **Proximity:**
       - Aggregating data based on behavior.
       - Concept of "Bad Neighborhoods" (e.g., Spamhaus vs. CyberBunker, Google Report, Moura 2013).
       - Grouping by Netblock and ASN.
     - **Temporal Decay:**
       - Even bad neighborhoods can change over time.
       - Using a half-life decay function to gradually forget old attack data.
   - **Feature Calculation:**
     - Clustering data to predict specific behaviors.
     - Creating a "Badness" rank.
     - Handling missing ASNs and bogons separately.
   - **Training the Model:**
     - Using the latest blocked log files as training data.
     - Gathering non-malicious IP addresses from Alexa and Chromium Top 1m Sites.
     - Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
   - **Results:**
     - Training data accuracy: 85-95%.
     - New data: 80-85% true positive rate, 85-90% true negative rate.
     - If the model flags an IP as "bad," it is 5.3 to 8.5 times more likely to be malicious.

7. **MLSec Project**
   - Personal project developing these and other algorithms.
   - Sign up, send logs, and receive reports generated by models.
   - Looking for contributors, ideas, and skeptics.
   - Visit [mlsecproject.org](http://mlsecproject.org) or email for more information.

8. **Acknowledgments and Thanks**
   - Special thanks to all contributors and supporters.

9. **Q&A and Feedback**
   - Open floor for questions.
   - Please fill out feedback forms.
