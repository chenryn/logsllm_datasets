Pseudo-Random Number Generator modules (certified by NIST),
useful to execute Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) primitives
efficiently. As for the Operative System (OS), the 3DR-Solo runs the
3DR Poky OS, based on the popular Linux Project Yocto [1].
We implemented ARID in C, and we integrated it within the
stock 3DR Poky OS, version 1.5.1. In particular, ARID runs on top
of the popular protocol MAVLink 1.0 [33] and on UDP, using the
lightweight Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library [2],
i.e., a highly optimized library for resource-constrained systems.

We recall that MAVLink is a lightweight messaging protocol, sup-
ported by the majority of commercially available UAVs, enabling
communication among UAVs and between a UAV and its on-board
components. We also recall that MAVLink over UDP requires the
exchange of frames characterized by a Maximum Transmission
Unit (MTU) of 263 bytes. We report the structure of the MAVLink
frame (customized to include the data of ARID as payload) in Fig-
ure 9 of Annex 8, while Table 3 (Annex 8) provides additional con-
figuration details. To implement ARID in a fully standard-compliant
fashion, we extended MAVLink with a dedicated Message ID (0xDE).
Moreover, each UAV features a static ID of 4 bytes provided from the
manufacturer, spanning in the range [0x00000000 − 0xFFFFFFFF].
We used El-Gamal elliptic curves (with point compression) for
encryption/decryption operations, and the ECDSA algorithm for
signature generation/verification [27]. We integrated the cited al-
gorithms through the OpenSSL library ver. 1.0.0 [37].
For the experimental evaluation, as well as to allow a complete
customization of the offered security services, we selected four
elliptic curves, i.e., secp160r1, secp192k1, secp224k1 and secp256k1,
providing security levels equivalent to 80, 96, 112 and 128 symmetric
key bits, according to the most recent NIST guidelines [7] (Table 4
(Annex 8) provides additional configuration details). Moreover, we
adopted the SHA-256 hashing function and a cryptographic Pseudo
Random Number Generator (PRNG) (/dev/urandom) seeded with
2, 048 bits. We selected the cited four curves because they provide
an adequate level of security for different scenarios, while also
allowing not to exceed the MAVLink MTU of 263 bytes. Additional
larger curves could be used but at the cost of message fragmentation
(not desirable). Finally, we implemented the generic receiver r and
the Authority Auth as separated processes on a regular laptop.
Our implementation on the 3DR-Solo requires 1, 559.168 KB of
Flash Memory (with a static linking of the adopted libraries) and
92.184 KB of RAM. We also released the source code of ARID to
allow interested Researchers and Industry to verify our claims and
possibly extend ARID with additional features [17].
Finally, we remark that our implementation leverages popular
open-source tools, such as the Poky OS, MAVLink, and OpenSSL,
supported by a large variety of commercial UAVs. The availability of
the code contributes to enhance the impact of ARID, demonstrating
its deployability, and fostering further research in the domain.
7.2 Performance Assessment
In this section, we report a few experimental tests performed using
the implementation discussed in Section 7.1, aimed at measuring
the cost of ARID on a real UAV in terms of time and energy.
We first measured the time needed to generate and transmit
a ARID packet on the 3DR-Solo, by considering the four elliptic
curves cited in Section 7.1. We report in Figure 7 the average time
required to execute ARID over 1, 000 tests (with 95% confidence
intervals), considering the separate contribution of the processing
(packet generation, cryptography operations) and radio operations.
Note that the measured time spans from the GPS location acquisi-
tion to the packet delivery (both included). In the worst case (curve
secp256k1), ARID requires 11.23 ms on average, ≈ 2 orders of magni-
tude less than the maximum interarrival time T = 1 s recommended

drone, considering different elliptic curves.
by the RemoteID rule, confirming its suitability for integration in
real UAVs.
To measure the energy consumption of each instance of ARID,
we used the telemetry data conveyed by the 3DR-Solo to the remote
controller through the MAVLink protocol. In detail, we measured
the difference in the electrical current drained by the drone between
two different states: (i) at rest; and, (ii) during the execution of ARID.
We computed an average difference of ≈ 20 mA in the electric
current drained by the drone over 1, 000 runs.
To estimate the energy consumption of the radio operations,
we considered that the radio chip on-board of the 3DR-Solo drone
is a chip of the family AR9300, working with an input voltage of
3.3 V, consuming 296.970 mA in TX mode and 187.879 mA in RX
mode with the IEEE 802.11b protocol [29]. We also assumed that a
packet is modulated through the standard Direct Sequence Spread
Spectrum (DSSS) modulation using Differential Binary Phase-Shift
Keying (DBPSK), a Transmission Rate of 1.0 Mbps on the 22 MHz
channel bandwidth, and a Short Guard Interval of 800 ns. We com-
puted the contributions of the processing and radio chip to the
overall energy consumption of ARID through Eq. 8.

being V the input voltage (15.11 V for the UAV’s battery and
3.3 V for the radio chip) and i(t) the instantaneous drained current
(additional 20 mA required by ARID on the UAV’s battery and
296.970 mA for the radio chip).
Figure 8 reports the average results of our experiments, together
with the 95% confidence interval, computed over 1, 000 tests. Table 4
in Appendix B also reports in a tabular form the values of time and
energy consumption of Figure 7 and Figure 8.
Taking as a reference the worst-case configuration (curve secp256k1),
ARID consumes only ≈ 4.72 mJ per instance (i.e., delivered ARID
packet), confirming once more its little impact on the UAV’s op-
erating life. Indeed, given that the overall capacity of the battery

Table 2 summarizes the discussion in Section 2, and compares
the cited contributions along reference system requirements.
We notice that previously published approaches are not com-
plaint with the requirements for anonymous remote UAVs identifi-
cation. Indeed, most of them provide anonymity by assuming the
continued availability of either an online authority or an element
of the infrastructure (such as the RSUs in VANETs) or the presence
of multiple peers in the network (the other vehicles in a VANET).
These assumptions are not realistic for commercial UAVs, often
piloted by independent pilots. At the same time, the approaches
previously proposed can require complex pairing operations, hardly
supported by small UAVs, as well as pseudonyms revocation pro-
cedures in case of misbehaviour, that would require connection to
additional infrastructure elements. Moreover, note that all previ-
ous approaches leveraged a list stored on the TA, used to translate
pseudonyms into long-term identities. Therefore, in case of a leak-
age/publication of the list, these solutions cannot further provide
the anonymity of the participating entities.
Conversely, ARID provides anonymous remote identification
for UAVs without any assistance, either from an online authority
or from a dedicated network infrastructure, and it also applies to
independent vehicles, with no other entities in the neighbourhood.
In addition, ARID does not require time- and energy- consuming
pairing operations. Furthermore, although the TA of ARID stores
the long-term identities of the UAV and the related public keys, the
long-term identities are always protected at run-time through the
public key of the Authority. Therefore, even in case of a leakage
on the TA, the anonymity of the registered drones is preserved,
provided that the TA private key(s) are kept secret. The combination
of all these features makes ARID the ideal solution for anonymous
remote identification of amateur, remotely-piloted UAVs.

powering the 3DR-Solo drone is 282, 860 J (5, 200 mAh), assum-
ing to adopt the curve secp256k1, ARID consumes on average only
≈ 1.67 · 10−6% of the battery of the drone for each instance.
Finally, we evaluated the impact of ARID on the battery lifetime.
We experimentally verified that the most energy-consuming con-
figuration of ARID (secp256k1) reduces the lifetime of the 3DR-Solo
by only 1.05% compared to the default (non-anonymous) RemoteID
configuration, further demonstrating its limited overhead.
7.3 Comparison
In this section, we compare ARID against current approaches for
anonymization as per what discussed in Section 2. Note that such
a comparison can only be qualitative, i.e., along reference system
requirements. Indeed, any quantitative comparison does not apply
to our case, as all the cited solutions require assumptions that
cannot be satisfied in our scenario, such as the presence of online
authorities and additional infrastructure elements or peers.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed ARID, a lightweight and low-cost pro-
tocol providing anonymous remote identification of Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles. ARID has been carefully designed to be fully com-
pliant with the latest RemoteID regulations by the FAA, while also
providing a tunable level of security. Overall, ARID offers complete
anonymity and unlinkability of UAVs broadcast messages, allowing
only the Trusted Authority (e.g., the FAA) to unveil the long-term
216ARID: Anonymous Remote IDentification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

identity of the emitting UAV. At the same time, ARID does not re-
quire interactions between UAVs and other infrastructure elements
or peers, and it can be provided as a simple software update.
While the security properties of ARID have been discussed and
formally proved via ProVerif, we also implemented a prototype of
ARID on a real 3DR-Solo drone, using the open-source Poky OS
and well-known OpenSSL cryptography library. Our experimental
performance evaluation shows that ARID requires at most only
≈ 11.23 ms to create and transmit anonymous RemoteID messages,
while spending at most ≈ 4.72 mJ of energy (≈ 1.67 · 10−6% of the
overall battery capacity).
We also released the source code of ARID [17], enabling the
interested community to verify our findings, as well as to foster
further research in the domain.
Future work include the extension of ARID to other domains,
such as avionics and maritime, enriched with the capability to
authenticate the ARID messages without compromising UAV’s ano-
nymity.
