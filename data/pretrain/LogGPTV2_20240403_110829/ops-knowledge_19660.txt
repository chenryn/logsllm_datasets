User: I am using Django on my Mac OS X server. Things are fine, so far. I have been using python 2.6.1 and all works well. I upgraded Python to version 2.7.3. Invoking python in the terminal brings up version 2.7.3, as expected. Checking Django using the {% debug %) reveals that Django is still using the original python 2.6.1 interpreter.
On this system, /usr/local/bin contains a symlink to ../../../Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
In /usr/bin I find the python interpreter, and from that directory, invoking ./python gets python 2.6.1 running. 
My $PATH is 
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/bin
which I believe must have been altered on the python 2.7.3 install.  
What is considered the optimal way to get the command line and Django using the same Python? I am considering either moving the framework version to /usr/bin and sitting a symlink in the framework to the moved new version. On the system is also a /Library/Python directory, that contains the site-packages for versions 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6.  In /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages are the major goodies django, mercurial, and south. 
Where are people putting things, nowadays? I mean, I know I could move things around, but I would like to anticipate where the Django project is going so future upgrades can go smoothly.
Assistant: Install it against the updated Python.
