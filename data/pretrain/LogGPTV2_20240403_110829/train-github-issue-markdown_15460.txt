### ‚úîÔ∏è Expected result
FancyZones should save my layout when I switch virtual desktops.
### ‚ùå Actual result
FancyZones is confusing the layout of Desktop A with Desktop B. If I reset it,
it eventually flips them around again. This started in the most recent update.
I think I updated PowerToys twice 2 days ago, so it was either this version or
the version immediately prior.
_What is the actual result of the above steps?_
