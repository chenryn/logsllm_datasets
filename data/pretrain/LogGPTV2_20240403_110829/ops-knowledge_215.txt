User: When I activate a venv, which pip returns /usr/local/bin/pip instead of path/to/my/apps/venv/bin/pop. Why is that?
I am inclined to just rm- rf the pip in /usr/local/bin/pip and install again, but since this is a production server I prefer not to guess too much :-)
My concern is that I have (in usr/local/bin):

easy_install
easy_install-2.6
pip
pip-2.6
virtualenv
virtualenv-2.6

python --version returns 2.6.6 and which python returns /usr/bin/python even though venvis activated?
Running Debian Squeeze
Assistant: What shell are you using?  What specific command did you use to activate the virtualenv?
In my case (also using squeeze) I am using bash and it if I run "source bin/activate" then everything in my path (pip, python, etc) is correct.
