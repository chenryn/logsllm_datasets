Verification
IN THIS SECTION
Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created | 1077
To confirm that the configuration is working properly, perform these tasks:
Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer named employee-monitor has been created on the switch with the appropriate
input interfaces and appropriate output interface.
1078
Action
You can verify the analyzer is configured as expected by using the show forwarding-options analyzer
command.
To verify that the analyzer is configured as expected while monitoring all employee traffic on the source
switch, run the show forwarding-options analyzer command on the source switch. The following output is
displayed for this example configuration on the source switch:
user@switch> show forwarding-options analyzer
Analyzer name : employee-monitor
Mirror rate : 1
Maximum packet length : 0
State : up
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Output nhg : remote-analyzer-nhg
user@switch> show forwarding-options next-hop-group
Next-hop-group: remote-analyzer-nhg
Type: layer-2
State: up
Members Interfaces:
ge-0/0/10.0
ge-0/0/11.0
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-monitor analyzer has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, which is the
default behavior), the state of the configuration is up, which indicates proper state and that the analyzer
is programmed, mirrors traffic entering or exiting interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1, and sends mirrored
traffic to multiple interfaces ge-0/0/10.0 and ge-0/0/11.0 through the next-hop-group remote-analyzer-
nhg. If the state of the output interface is down or if the output interface is not configured, the value of
state will be down and the analyzer will not be able to mirror traffic.

Mirroring All Employee Traffic for Remote Analysis Through a Transit Switch | 1082
Verification | 1088
EX9200 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering or exiting a VLAN
You can analyze the mirrored traffic using a protocol analyzer application running on a remote
monitoring station if you are sending mirrored traffic to an analyzer VLAN.
This topic includes an example that describes how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch to the
remote-analyzer VLAN through a transit switch, so that you can perform analysis from a remote
monitoring station.
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
• Disable your configured mirroring sessions when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by:
• Using statistical sampling.
• Setting ratios to select statistical samples.
1080
• Using firewall filters.
This example describes how to configure remote mirroring through a transit switch:
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• An EX9200 switch connected to another EX9200 switch through a third EX9200 switch
• Junos OS Release 13.2 or later for EX Series switches
Before you configure remote mirroring, be sure that:
• The interfaces that the analyzer will use as input interfaces have been configured on the switch.
Overview and Topology
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 1081
This example describes how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch to the remote-analyzer VLAN
through a transit switch so that you can perform analysis on all traffic from employee computers.
In this configuration, an analyzer session is required on the destination switch to mirror incoming traffic
from the analyzer VLAN to the egress interface to which the remote monitoring station is connected.
Figure 37 on page 1081 shows the network topology for this example.
1081
Topology
Figure 37: Network Monitoring for Remote Mirroring Through a Transit Switch
In this example:
1. Interface ge-0/0/0 is a Layer 2 interface, and interface ge-0/0/1 is a Layer 3 interface (both
interfaces on the source switch) that serve as connections for employee computers.
2. Interface ge-0/0/10 is a Layer 2 interface that connects to the transit switch.
3. Interface ge-0/0/11 is a Layer 2 interface on the transit switch.
4. Interface ge-0/0/12 is a Layer 2 interface on the transit switch and connects to the destination
switch.
5. Interface ge-0/0/13 is a Layer 2 interface on the destination switch.
6. Interface ge-0/0/14 is a Layer 2 interface on the destination switch and connects to the remote
monitoring station.
7. VLAN remote-analyzer is configured on all switches in the topology to carry the mirrored traffic.
