At the end, there is a confusing explanation about "Duplicated data from
props" in the section "What Shouldnâ€™t Go in State?":
> **Duplicated data from props:** Try to use props as the source of truth
> where possible. Because props can change over time, it's appropriate to
> store props in state to be able to know its previous values.

> **Duplicated data from props:** Try to use props as the source of truth
> where possible. One valid use to store props in state is to be able to know
> it's previous values, because props can change over time.
