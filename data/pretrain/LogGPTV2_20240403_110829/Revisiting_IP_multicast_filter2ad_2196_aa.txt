## Abstract
This paper revisits the well-explored topic of multicast routing in networking, specifically the search for a simple yet fully general multicast design. Years of research into multicast routing have led to a generally pessimistic view that the complexity of multicast, especially inter-domain multicast, can only be overcome by restricting the service model (e.g., single-source multicast). This paper proposes a new approach to implementing IP multicast, which we hope will lead to a reevaluation of this commonly held view.

## 1. Introduction
In 1990, Deering proposed IP multicast as an extension to the IP unicast service model for efficient multipoint communication [1]. The multicast service model offered two key benefits: (1) efficient use of bandwidth for multipoint communication, and (2) the indirection of a group address, which allows for network-level rendezvous and service discovery. Deering's proposal triggered extensive research on the implementation and applications of IP multicast.

However, the deployment of IP multicast has had mixed success. While support for multicast is built into virtually every end host and IP router, and the service is often deployed within enterprise networks, there is little cross-provider global deployment. Fifteen years after Deering's seminal work, the vision of a ubiquitous multicast "dialtone" remains elusive.

Theories abound for why this vision was never realized, broadly questioning the practical feasibility and desirability of IP multicast. The first concern is the complexity of deploying and managing multicast at the network layer. The second is whether the demand for multicast applications justifies the complexity of its deployment, including issues such as charging for the service and the adequacy of alternative solutions.

This paper directly addresses the issue of feasibility, proposing a simpler approach to implementing IP multicast called Free Riding Multicast (FRM). We focus on inter-domain multicast, where complexity is particularly acute, but FRM can also be extended to intra-domain scenarios. FRM offers two key advantages:
- By leveraging existing unicast routes, FRM virtually eliminates the need for a distributed multicast route computation, thus side-stepping much of the network layer complexity associated with traditional solutions.
- A domain's participation and use of inter-domain multicast are effected via the same channel as in the unicast case, namely BGP, offering network operators a familiar framework for management (access control, accounting, etc.).

These advantages come at a cost, as FRM requires more storage and algorithmic sophistication at routers and can be less efficient in bandwidth consumption than traditional multicast solutions. However, given current technology trends, we believe this tradeoff is worth exploring.

## 2. In Defense of IP Multicast
While we make no claims to understand the "market" for multicast, we observe that many applications that originally motivated multicast research have arrived and would still benefit from native multicast support. For example, massive multiplayer online games (MMORPGs) have seen significant growth, with up to 5 million active subscriptions in a year [10]. In these games, player moves must be propagated to those in their "virtual" vicinity. Currently, game operators achieve this by deploying multiple servers, each assigned a region of the virtual world, that relay communication between players. This can lead to server overload and poor user experience. IP Multicast could reduce server bandwidth requirements, making the infrastructure more lightweight and cost-effective.

Another example is the adoption of Internet TV technology, with several providers already in customer trials. These efforts use IP multicast within their networks but currently rely on pre-provisioned channels from content sources. Supporting multicast across domains would allow ISPs to extend this delivery to more viewers and content providers without requiring each content provider to partner with individual ISPs.

File-sharing, software updates, RSS dissemination, video conferencing, and grid computing are additional examples of deployed services that could leverage multicast delivery.

It has been argued that it is difficult for ISPs to charge for multicast, leaving them with little incentive for deployment. However, we assume that ISPs will enforce a more closed access model, enabling them to charge for and better control usage. Given a closed usage model, the emergence of ISP hosting services and IPTV suggests that viable charging models exist; ISPs can charge server operators and/or end users for multicast connectivity.

Some argue that alternate techniques such as source-specific (SSM) or application-layer multicast can meet the needs of the above applications. While SSM can handle multi-source applications, it loses the rendezvous features of the more general service model. Application-layer solutions, while offering the benefits of multicast, do so with different tradeoffs. Scaling these to a global user population represents a significant investment in bandwidth, server resources, and management. Network-layer solutions, by contrast, allow the deployment of services that scale by augmenting an existing global ecosystem of infrastructure, services, customers, and peering arrangements.

By lowering the complexity of network-layer multicast, we hope to shift the debate back to the utility of IP multicast. The above discussion offers examples of existing applications that stand to gain from ISP deployment of IP multicast. We conjecture that both network and application-layer solutions to multicast, used appropriately, have much to offer in the implementation and scaling of networked applications.

## 3. FRM: Background and Approach
IP Multicast offers end hosts a simple abstraction: a host can join or leave a multicast group G, and any host can send to a group G. The multicast routing problem is key to supporting this service model and has been the subject of much research over the years. We start with a brief review of this literature, distinguishing between multicast routing and forwarding.

### 3.1 Multicast Routing
Deering's early work defined DVMRP, a broadcast-and-prune approach in which a packet multicast by a source S is forwarded towards all end hosts, and those that receive unwanted packets send "prune" messages up the distribution tree toward the source [1, 21]. DVMRP constructs efficient shortest-path trees from any source but scales poorly, limiting it to intra-domain routing.

Another intra-domain protocol is MOSPF, a multicast extension to unicast OSPF. MOSPF builds efficient trees but is limited to networks that run link-state protocols.

Shared tree protocols such as Core-Based Trees (CBT) [22] and PIM-SM [23] emerged to address the poor scaling of flood-and-prune tree construction. These protocols associate a special rendezvous point (RP) router that serves as the root of a single tree shared across all senders for a group. While shared-tree protocols offer a dramatic improvement in scalability, they give rise to non-trivial issues regarding the placement and discovery of RPs.

BGMP [25] supports source-rooted, shared, and bidirectional shared trees. Key to BGMP is the association of a group to a "home" AS responsible for allocating the group address. The home AS acts as the domain-level RP for the group's routing tree. To map a group to its home AS, BGMP proposes address advertisement (AAP) [25] that may be used in conjunction with MASC [28], a dynamic address allocation protocol.

The increasing complexity of multicast routing led Holbrook et al. [4] to challenge Deering's service model. They argued that many large-scale applications only require delivery from a single, well-known source. Their Express protocol (now PIM-SSM) proposes a single-source service model in which a multicast "channel" is identified by both a group (G) and source (S) IP address. Endhost joins/leaves specify an (S, G) channel address, and only the source S may transmit to a channel. This compromise has done much to further ISP adoption of IP Multicast, but at the cost of losing the generality of multicast as a network-layer rendezvous mechanism.

### 3.2 Multicast Forwarding
Efforts to scale multicast routing have been complemented by concerns about the scalability of multicast forwarding state within routers. Because group membership need not be topologically contained, multicast forwarding entries are not easily aggregatable, and forwarding state grows linearly in the number of groups that pass through a router. Thaler and Handley [29] propose an interface-centric implementation model applicable to shared-bus router architectures, allowing some aggregation. However, this model does not apply to switched router architectures or implementations that store forwarding state as a list of per-group incoming-outgoing interfaces. Radoslavov [30] proposes "leaky" aggregation, trading off bandwidth for scalability in state, while Briscoe et al. [31] propose a scheme wherein applications cooperate to select addresses that aid aggregation.

### Discussion
The quest for a satisfactory multicast routing solution has led down an increasingly complex path. Commercial routers advertise implementations of PIM-SM, PIM-DM, Bidir-PIM, PIM-SSM, AutoRP, MBGP, MSDP, and IGMP v1, v2, v3, while still lacking support for address allocation (MASC/AAP) and scalable inter-domain (BGMP) protocols. The complexity of the ensemble greatly raises the barrier to deployment of a multicast service. Our primary goal with FRM is to provide a "leaner" solution while retaining acceptable performance.

## 4. FRM: Approach and Tradeoffs

### 4.1 Approach
In the abstract, multicast delivery requires knowledge of: (1) which end hosts are group members, and (2) how to reach these member hosts or domains. While most solutions combine these two components into a single from-the-ground-up protocol, FRM decouples membership discovery from route discovery. This separation offers the advantage that, once group members are known, any source can construct the multicast tree from its unicast routes to each member host. This is easily done for path-vector or link-state unicast protocols that reveal the required paths.

For inter-domain routing, the basic FRM scheme operates as follows: a domain's BGP advertisements are augmented with a description of the multicast groups currently in use within the domain. These advertisements are then propagated as per the normal operation of BGP, giving every border router a description of the groups present in each destination prefix. To discover the dissemination tree for a group G, the border router at the source (denoted Rs) scans its BGP table to identify those prefixes with members of G. Having identified all destination domains, Rs computes the dissemination tree from the union of the BGP unicast paths to all destination domains. Rs then forwards a single copy of the packet to each next hop on this dissemination tree along with an encoding of the subtree each next hop should forward to.

### 4.2 Tradeoffs
FRM offers a simpler approach to multicast routing by leveraging existing unicast routes, but this comes at the cost of higher bandwidth and storage requirements at routers. The core tradeoff FRM makes is to shift the complexity of route computation to the internals of a router, rather than relying on distributed protocol mechanisms. This tradeoff is one we believe is worth exploring given current technology trends and the continued difficulties in taming wide-area routing algorithms.
