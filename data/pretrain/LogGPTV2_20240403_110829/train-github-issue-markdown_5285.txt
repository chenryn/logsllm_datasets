(This is a feature that I've been working on (see #21493 (comment)). I open
this issue so that relevant PRs can be better tracked.)
## ðŸš€ Feature and Motivation
Better CMake integration. Currently there are a lot of inconsistency and
redundancy between the Python setup scripts and CMake scripts (duplicated env
check, overriding env check, inconsistent treatment of which results of
checking will be used, etc.). I would like to improve the integration.
## Pitch
The improvement I would like to implement includes:
  * Allowing build options to be directly specified using options specified in CMakeLists.txt (without explicitly being processed in Python setup scripts).
  * Allowing users to adjust build options directly via cmake-gui/ccmake/editing CMakeCache.txt (currently users must take care of both options in CMakeCache.txt and environmental variables passed to setup.py and ensure they are consistent upon rebuild).
  * removing a lot of system and library environment checks in Python setup scripts while CMake can already handle them pretty well.
  * ...
