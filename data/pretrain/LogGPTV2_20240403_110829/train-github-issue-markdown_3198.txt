If you have created a geometry and need to update the vertex coordinates over time for vertex animation, the best approach to ensure that these changes are reflected in your mesh depends on the specific graphics API or rendering engine you are using. Here are some general steps and considerations:

1. **Update Vertex Buffer:**
   - **Direct Access:** If you have direct access to the vertex buffer, you can update the vertex coordinates directly. This is typically done by mapping the buffer, updating the data, and then un-mapping it.
   - **Dynamic Buffers:** Use dynamic vertex buffers if your API supports them. These are designed for frequent updates and can be more efficient.

2. **Notify the Renderer:**
   - After updating the vertex buffer, you may need to notify the renderer that the buffer has changed. This can involve calling a function to update the buffer or marking it as dirty.

3. **Redraw the Mesh:**
   - Ensure that the mesh is redrawn after the vertex buffer is updated. This might involve calling a render function or triggering a redraw event.

4. **Optimization:**
   - **Minimize Updates:** Only update the vertices that have actually changed to reduce the amount of data being transferred.
   - **Batch Updates:** If possible, batch multiple vertex updates together to minimize the number of times the buffer is updated.

Here is an example in pseudocode for a typical scenario:

```pseudocode
// Assume 'vertexBuffer' is your vertex buffer and 'vertices' is an array of new vertex coordinates
for each vertex in vertices:
    vertexBuffer.updateVertex(vertex.index, vertex.newCoordinates)

// Notify the renderer that the vertex buffer has been updated
renderer.markBufferAsDirty(vertexBuffer)

// Redraw the mesh
renderer.renderMesh(mesh)
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the changes to the vertex coordinates are properly reflected in your mesh, allowing for smooth vertex animation.
