### (iii) Slight Bias Towards Negative ΔMOS

There is a slight yet noticeable bias towards negative ΔMOS, where the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for H1 is higher than that for H2. This finding contrasts with previous results, as the difference between H2 and H1 is much more subtle and inconsistent. This observation underscores the importance of conducting experiments on real-world web pages rather than benchmark pages, which can exaggerate MOS differences.

The results are only partially surprising for several reasons:
1. **Page Variability**: Web pages vary significantly (see Fig. 2), and ΔMOS changes according to the specific page being considered (Fig. 5b). The order of web pages in Fig. 2 is consistent.
2. **User Perception**: Users have different ways of "valuing improvement," sometimes reporting the same score under both protocols, leading to ΔMOS = 0.
3. **Optimization**: Pages in our catalog are likely optimized for H1.
4. **Protocol Maturity**: H1 has undergone decades of testing and optimization, whereas H2 is a relatively new protocol.

### 5.2 Impact of Page Sharding

We now examine the impact of sharding, a technique that distributes page content across multiple domains to exploit server parallelism. This practice helps overcome the limitation on the maximum number of connections a browser can establish with a single domain. Given the benefits of H2, which uses a single connection to a single domain, one might expect that unsharding would help leverage H2's pipelining features. In our evaluation, we selected 10 out of 20 pages from our catalog and modified them to host all content on a single domain (i.e., unsharded). We then compared the MOS grades to assess the impact of (un)sharding for H2 and H1 independently.

Figure 6 illustrates the per-page difference between the average MOS for unsharded and sharded content. Mathematically, ΔMOS = E[MOS|unsharded] – E[MOS|sharded]. The pages are sorted increasingly according to ΔMOS for H2. It is evident that the impact of sharding is page-dependent: some pages benefit from unsharding (ΔMOS > 0), while others suffer from it (ΔMOS < 0).

### 5.3 Effect of Round-Trip Time (RTT)

In this section, we explore the effect of RTT on MOS. For low-RTT scenarios (RTT ≤ 50 ms), the MOS remains stable. However, in high-RTT scenarios (RTT > 50 ms), the MOS degrades, losing approximately 0.58 points compared to the low-RTT scenario. This trend is observed for both H1 and H2, with H1 performing better in heterogeneous RTT conditions. Similar to [23], we found that macroscopic page characteristics do not fully explain user MOS. The performance gap is rooted in the page dependency graph, and homogeneous latencies may obscure intricate interactions that become apparent only under heterogeneous conditions.

### 6. Objective Metrics on Real Pages

Finally, we compare H1 and H2 using objective metrics (OBJ). We quantify the difference in accessing the same page over the two protocols with ΔOBJ = OBJH2 − OBJH1, where OBJ includes Time to First Byte (TTFB), Document Object Model (DOM) loading time, and Page Load Time (PLT). We also consider the ObjectIndex, a replacement metric for the SpeedIndex, which is strongly correlated with the latter [5].

Figure 8 presents the histogram of ΔOBJ using bins of 100 ms, annotated with relevant statistics. All OBJ exhibit an empirical probability mass function similar to that of ΔMOS (roughly symmetric, peak close to zero, very low median). Here, ΔOBJ slightly favors H2, unlike in the ΔMOS case.

Excluding TTFB, which is not the most appropriate metric for web page performance, H2 shows better results than H1 in at least 54% of tests. This indicates that H2 speeds up the page loading process and DOM loading time, but these improvements are not reflected in user experience, with users rating H1 and H2 similarly in 55% of cases (see Fig. 5).

### 7. Conclusions

This paper presents the first study comparing the performance of H2 and H1 in terms of MOS, using both subjective (a MOS corpus of over 4,000 points) and objective metrics. The results do not clearly favor one protocol over the other. While H2 reduces PLT on simple pages, improving the quality of experience, it is less effective on real-world web pages. Objective metrics show performance improvements for H2 in more than 50% of cases, but they fail to predict user MOS, which is often higher for H1.

This highlights the importance of user feedback and calls for future research to develop new models that enhance the correlation between MOS and QoE metrics.
