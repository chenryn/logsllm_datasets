group. The results are shown in Fig. 5(b). Again, the ab-
solute values of the three curves are normalized to be com-
parable with each other. This (cid:2)gure shows that we can use
the diurnal model to forecast the propagation of botnets us-
ing a similar vulnerability. Similar predictions for the North
American and Asian groups appear in Figs. 6(b), 7(b). The
predictive feature of the diurnal model is not as good as in
the European group. Fig. 6(b) shows that the online in-
fected hosts in the North American group is not as smooth
as in the European group, and the Botnet 2 infections in-
creased slightly after the (cid:2)rst two days instead of dropping.
For the Asian group, Fig. 7(b) clearly shows that the (cid:2)rst
two-days have a different pattern than the third day. We
speculate that the North American and Asian groups have
more noise because countries in these groups tend to span
numerous time zones with large numbers of infected indi-
viduals, and China has one time zone for the entire country.
By comparison, the European countries tend to occupy a
single zone, and most victims are located in the western-
most time zones.
As shown in Fig. 5(b), the diurnal model can predict the
dynamics of botnets, but not their infected population. (Re-
call that the model derives (cid:11)(t) values, which describe the
relative fraction of users online.) There are some other ways
to predict vulnerable or infected populations for an Inter-
net virus or worm. For example, Zou et al. [ZGGT03] pre-
sented a method to predict the vulnerable population based
on a worm’s initial propagation speed and its scan rate (cid:17).
We note that the derived diurnal dynamics of a botnet
have an unknown shelf life. If a model is derived from a
botnet, its predictive power decays over time, since users
migrate to new platforms, clean machines, or replace equip-
ment. The botnets studied in the example above all took
place within the same 3-week period. Since malware is of-
ten released in rapid succession (e.g., version.A, version.B,
etc. of the same exploit), long-term changes in victim pop-
ulations might not affect short-term forecasting. Our data
did not permit a longitudinal study of the predictive power
of older botnets. Future work will identify factors that af-
fect the validity of derived (cid:11)(t) values over an extended
time period.
Another limiting factor in our model comes from the in-
troduction of additional propagation mechanisms. Many
instances of malware, e.g., phatbot [LUR04], spread us-
ing many different infection vectors, such as e-mail, ran-
dom scanning and local exploits. Our model does not ad-
dress malware that combines additional types of propaga-
tion techniques in subsequent releases. Future work will
explore techniques to identify dominant propagation mech-
anisms used in malware, and hybrid models derived from
different botnets with distinct (cid:11)(t) values.
3.6.2 Release Times
The short-term spread of a worm will vary, depending on
the time of release and the distribution of the affected pop-
ulation across different time zones. Knowing the optimal
release time for a worm will help us improve surveillance
and response. To identify the optimal release time, we per-
form the following steps:
(cid:15) Obtain the scan rate (cid:17) and scanning distribution, and
vulnerable population for each zone;
(cid:15) Obtain the (cid:11)(t) values for each zone; and
(cid:15) Using the diurnal model Eqn. (5) to calculate (numer-
ical solution) the infected population six hours after
release for different release time to derive the optimal
release time.
As an example, we identify an optimal release time in a
scenario where the worm uniformly scans the Internet and
all three diurnal groups have the same number of vulner-
able population, i.e., N1 = N2 = N3. The diurnal dy-
namics of different groups will not matter much for a very
slow spreading worm that needs to spread out with at least
several days. It also does not matter much for a very fast
spreading worm that can (cid:2)nish infecting all online vulner-
able hosts within an hour (cid:151) its infection range is solely
determined by the population of current online comput-
ers. Therefore, we study the propagation of a middle-speed
worm that can spread out in several hours. For example,
Code Red is one such worm, which (cid:2)nished its infection
in 14 hours [Moo02a]. For this reason, we study a Code
Red-like worm that has the total vulnerable population
N1 + N2 + N3 = 360; 000, and (cid:17) = 358/min [ZGGT03].
For the purpose of studying worm release time, we assume
(cid:13) = 0.
Figure 8(a) shows the propagation of the worm when it is
released at 00:00, 06:00 and 12:00 UTC time, respectively.
It clearly shows the impact of the diurnal phenomenon on
a worm’s propagation speed. Refer to the diurnal dynamics
shown in Figure 3, the worm released at 12:00 UTC propa-
gates faster than the other worms at the initial stage, because
it catches the largest portion of the vulnerable population
online in the following several hours. Note that these results
are particular to the botnet under consideration, and not all
bots. Other botnets will of course have different growth pat-
terns, based on their unique (cid:11)(t) values.
Figure 8(b) shows the same phenomenon from a differ-
ent perspective. Here we consider the maximum infected
population six hours after a worm is released.
(We se-
lect six hours as an estimated time required for antivirus or
worm monitoring efforts to generate a signature for a new
worm [Mar04].) The worm propagates most widely within
six hours when it is released around 12:00 UTC, which

Figure 8. Worm propagation when released at different time
is 9:00pm in Tokyo and South Korea, 8:00pm in China,
7:00am in US Eastern. When the botnet starts to grow, it
captures some of the evening users in Asia, the mid-day
population in Europe, and the early morning users in North
America. Six hours later, the Asian population has de-
creased, but has been substantially replaced by the evening
European and mid-day North American users. Thus, by re-
leasing at 12:00 UTC, the worm captures signi(cid:2)cant por-
tions of all three population groups within six hours.
If we compare the propagation speed when a worm is
released at 00:00 UTC and 06:00 UTC, we can see that the
worm released at 00:00 UTC propagates faster in the (cid:2)rst
several hours (as shown in Figure 8(a)). However, it will
slow down its infection speed and infects slower than the
other one after 8 hours.
This interesting observation has important implications
for network administrators. Suppose two worms break out,
with the similar infection ability and diurnal properties, and
are released at 00:00 and 06:00 UTC, respectively. We no-
tice the spread of the 00:00 worm seems more rapid at (cid:2)rst
than the other one. (We might observe this by witnessing
lots of sensor alerts). Just using (cid:17) or an alert rate, we might
conclude that somehow this worm is spreading rapidly, and
is more urgent. So we might want to prioritize response
over the 06:00 worm. But, if we know both worms have a
similar diurnal property, we know that the 06:00 worm is
a higher priority, even though it is spreading at a slightly
slower rate in the (cid:2)rst few hours.
Being able to distinguish worms based on their optimal
release times is useful to security researchers. For example,
it can better determine the defense priority for two viruses
or worms released in sequence. As noted, malware of-
ten goes through generational releases, e.g., worm.A and
worm.B, where the malware author improves the code or
adds features in each new release. The diurnal model lets
us critically consider the signi(cid:2)cance of code changes that
affect S(t) (the susceptible population). For example, if
worm.A locally affects Asia, and worm.B then adds a new
feature that also affects European users, there clearly is an
increase in its overall S(t), and worm.B might become a
higher priority. But when worm.B comes out, relative to
when worm.A started, plays an important role. For exam-
ple, if the European users are in a diurnal low phase, then
the new features in worm.B do not pose an immediate near-
term threat.
In such a case, worm.A could still pose the
greater threat, since it has already spread for several hours.
On the other hand, if worm.B is released at a time when the
European countries are in an upward diurnal phase, then
worm.B could potentially overtake worm.A with the addi-
tion of the new victims. The diurnal model exposes this
non-obvious result.
Our model lets researchers calculate optimal release
times for worms and therefore rank them based on predicted
short-term growth rates. We note worm writers cannot
similarly use the model to maximize the short-term spread
of their malware. Being able to calculate the appropriate
time of day to maximize an infection requires the botmas-
ter to know the diurnal shaping function for each time zone.
Worm writers might know (cid:17), and other important variables
in Eqn. (5). But (cid:11)(t) is necessary to (cid:2)nd an optimal release
time, and is hard to know. In effect, worm writers would
have to create their own distributed monitoring projects like
[Ull05, YBJ04, Par04] to accurately derive diurnal shaping
functions for selected regions. In this respect, administra-
tors potentially have one advantage over botmasters. Ap-
propriate detection and response technologies can leverage
this knowledge.
4 Related Work
Botnets are a fairly new topic for researchers, but have
been around for almost a decade [CJ05]. Some work fo-
cuses on the symptoms caused by botnets instead of the
networks themselves. In [KKJB05], the authors designed
sets of Turing tests (puzzles) that users must solve to ac-
cess over-taxed resources. We further distinguish our work
from the extensive literature on DDoS traceback and de-
tection, [MVS01], in that our approach attempts to predict
botnet dynamics before they launch attacks.
A few researchers have noted techniques for detecting
bots using basic misuse detection systems [Han04], and
IRC traces [Bru03]. These investigations focus on track-
ing individual bots (e.g., to obtain a binary), while ours fo-
cuses on capturing the network cloud of coordinated attack-
ers. The only other research directly on countering botnets
(as opposed to individual bots) is [FHW05]. The authors in
[FHW05] use honeypots to in(cid:2)ltrate the C&C network of
botnets.

thors presented models for the spread of viruses and

Epidemic modeling of viruses was discussed
in
[MSVS03, WW03]. Mod-
els have also been proposed for a few famous worms,
including CodeRed [ZGT02, Moo02a, Sta01] and Slam-
mer [MPS+03]. In [ZTG04], the authors noted the need
to create new models that capture new transmission capa-
bilities (e.g., email) used by worms.
Our study of diurnal behavior in malware has implica-
tions for research into worm epidemics.
In [MVS05],
the authors speculated about the ability of worms to halt
spreading (and thereby become more stealthy) after sens-
ing that the vulnerable population had saturated. The
pronounced diurnal behavior we noted suggests that self-
stopping worms may become mislead about the absence of
victims online, particularly if their spread time is less than
