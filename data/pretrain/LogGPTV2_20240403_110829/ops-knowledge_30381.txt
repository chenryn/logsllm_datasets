Do you have idea what I try next?

Assistant: Here is what I did and it fixed it - Thanks to Mary.

Create a batch file with the following and run it from a command prompt.   

regsvr32 MSXML3.dll /s  
net stop wuauserv  
cd /d %windir%\SoftwareDistribution  
rd /s /q DataStore  
net start wuauserv   
regsvr32 softpub.dll   
regsvr32 mssip32.dll  



Go to services and stop the Windows Update service  
Go to the Windows directory (default is c:\Windows) and rename the "SoftwareDistribution"   folder to "SoftwareDistribution.old"  
Go to services and start the Windows Update service
