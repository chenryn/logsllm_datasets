When enabling log scale for the bar plot, the bars are not plotted properly
and the plot is empty.
See also this bug report #163 and the corresponding fix #2147.
Commit `dda42ab` changed the default value of `nonpos` parameter from `clip`
to `mask` which introduced the issue. I cannot tell whether `clip` should be
default behavior or `mask` doesn't work as intended.
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.bar(x=[1,2,3], height=[1000,2,3])
    plt.yscale("log")
    plt.show()
Result is an empty plot. Saving to an image file or PDF doesn't make a change.
Adding
    plt.yscale("log", nonposy="clip")
fixes that issue.
