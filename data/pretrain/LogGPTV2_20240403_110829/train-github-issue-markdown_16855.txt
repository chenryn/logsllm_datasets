When enabling the log scale for a bar plot, the bars are not displayed correctly, resulting in an empty plot. This issue is documented in bug report #163 and the corresponding fix #2147.

The problem was introduced by commit `dda42ab`, which changed the default value of the `nonpos` parameter from `clip` to `mask`. It is unclear whether `clip` should be the default behavior or if `mask` is not functioning as intended.

To reproduce the issue, you can use the following code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a bar plot with log scale on the y-axis
plt.bar(x=[1, 2, 3], height=[1000, 2, 3])
plt.yscale("log")
plt.show()
```

This results in an empty plot. Saving the plot to an image file or PDF does not resolve the issue.

To fix the problem, you can explicitly set the `nonposy` parameter to `clip`:

```python
plt.yscale("log", nonposy="clip")
```
