Currently, VSCode doesn't show any kind of graphical feedback of where
function breakpoints have bound to.
Visual Studio and other IDEs show some graphical feedback to show the function
breakpoint has bound to some specific locations / the debugger is in break
mode at a particular line because of a function breakpoint.  
It would be great for VSCode to support this in the case when debug adapters
report the line(s) where the function breakpoint has been bound.
This helps users determine that
  * there is a breakpoint that will be hit at some locations
  * a breakpoint has been hit when stopped at a function breakpoint.
