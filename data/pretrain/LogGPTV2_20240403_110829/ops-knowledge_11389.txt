User: How to configure and manage multiple servers remotely using Ansible?
Assistant: Using Ansible to remotely configure and manage multiple servers requires the following steps: 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on the local computer, and make sure that all remote servers that need to be managed have also installed Ansible. 2. Configure SSH key authentication: In order to remotely manage the server, you need to use SSH key to log in. Create an SSH key on the local computer and copy the public key to all servers that need to be managed. 3. Create the Ansible configuration file: Create the Ansible configuration file ansible.cfg on the local computer, specify the list of servers to be managed, the SSH login user name, and the key file path. 4. Create an Ansible host inventory file: Create an Ansible host inventory file inventory on the local computer, listing all server IP addresses or domain names that need to be managed. 5. Write Ansible playbook: Write an Ansible playbook on the local computer to define the operations that need to be performed on all servers. 6. Run the Ansible playbook: use the ansible-playbook command on the local computer to run the Ansible playbook, and call the Ansible module to perform operations on the remote server. Through the above steps, you can use Ansible to remotely configure and manage multiple servers.
