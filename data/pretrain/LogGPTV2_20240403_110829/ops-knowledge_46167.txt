User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is my computer at risk of being hacked when using public Wi-Fi? I'm sitting at a cafe, using their public Wi-Fi. I don't go on sensitive sites; I basically go to a music site and listen to a live stream, for which there's no login. I don't check my email or visit any password-protected sites. Some rare times, I visit Stack Overflow, for which I'm automatically logged in. I'm using Windows 7 64-bit with AVG Internet Security.


Can someone hack into my computer and see/download my files?
Is there anything risky about what I'm doing?

Assistant: Maybe.  The question is not whether there is a possibility that someone might be able to hack into your computer; the answer to that question is always yes, it might be possible.  If you are connected to a network, we can't rule out the possibility that someone might be able to attack you.  Rather, the right question is, how big is the risk?

In your case, if you use good security practices, the risk is pretty modest.  Good security practices are things like turning on automatic updates to keep all programs updated with the latest security patches, using anti-virus, using a firewall (should be enabled by default on Windows 7), and not visiting any site that requires a login over public Wi-Fi.
Not especially risky.  It sounds like your practices are relatively safe.

The biggest risk has to do with visiting Stack Overflow: because you are using a public Wi-Fi network, and because Stack Overflow does not use SSL (HTTPS), if someone there were malicious, they could steal your Stack Overflow login credentials and take control of your Stack Overflow account.  They might not be able to learn your Stack Overflow password, if you never type it into your browser while using public Wi-Fi, but they could still learn the authentication cookie that's stored in your user and that's used to log you in.  At that point, once they have the authentication cookie, they have control of your Stack Overflow account.

However, this risk is relatively modest, because it's just your Stack Overflow account, and let's be honest, it's probably not the end of the world if someone steals your Stack Overflow account.  The Stack Overflow folks know about this security risk, and they've been asked to adopt HTTPS to mitigate this risk, but they have declined to adopt HTTPS because they consider the risk to be of low-severity and they consider Stack Overflow accounts to be not important enough to be worth worrying about very much.
