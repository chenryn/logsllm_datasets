With EhCach you can register event listeners with individual caches.
Unfortunately, Spring's EhCacheFactoryBean does not provide the facility for
configuring these.
We still have the option of configuring the caches in ehcache.xml (see
http://ehcache.org/EhcacheUserGuide.html#id.s28), but I much prefer doing this
via EhCacheFactoryBean.
I suggest being able to inject a List of CacheEventListenerFactory objects
into EhCacheFactoryBean, which would then register them with the cache it
creates.
