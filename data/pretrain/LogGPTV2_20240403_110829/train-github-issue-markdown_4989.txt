When using EhCache, it is possible to register event listeners with individual caches. However, Spring's `EhCacheFactoryBean` does not currently provide a way to configure these event listeners.

While we still have the option of configuring the caches in `ehcache.xml` (as detailed in the [EhCache User Guide](http://ehcache.org/EhcacheUserGuide.html#id.s28)), I would prefer to handle this configuration through the `EhCacheFactoryBean`.

To address this, I propose that we enable the injection of a `List` of `CacheEventListenerFactory` objects into the `EhCacheFactoryBean`. This would allow the factory bean to register these listeners with the cache it creates.
