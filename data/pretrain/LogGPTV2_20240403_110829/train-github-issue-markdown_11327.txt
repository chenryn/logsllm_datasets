  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
We upgraded from version `5.0.1-canary.17` to version `6.0.0-canary.2`. This
was to fix a problem with pressing the back button whilst using the Safari
browser. This problem was fixed but we created another issue with the
stylesheets. The stylesheets were previously being bundled together and served
correctly, now they're not.
## Current Behavior
We initially had this setup in our `_document.js` page. However, the 'fs'
module errored and we found the latest solution here: #4119
    import React from 'react';
    import Document, { Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
    import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
    const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
    function getStyles() {
      return readFileSync(`${process.cwd()}/src/.next/static/style.css`, {
        encoding: 'utf8',
      });
    }
    export default class extends Document {
      render() {
        return (
              {dev && (
              )}
              {!dev && }
        );
      }
    }
We thus changed to the below noted, and removed the `fs` module causing that
error.
    import React from 'react';
    import Document, { Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
    const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
    export default class extends Document {
      render() {
        const { buildManifest } = this.props;
        const { css } = buildManifest;
        console.log('buildManifest', buildManifest);
        console.log('css', css);
        return (
              {css.map(file => (
              ))}
        );
      }
    }
However, we now have a new problem as only some of our styling is being ported
over. the log of the `css` array pulled out of the `buildManifest` has two CSS
paths, we suspect that one is overwriting the other perhaps instead of being
bundled together.
     css: [ 'static/style.css', 'static/style.css' ],
      'main.js': [ 'static/commons/main.js' ],
      'bundles/pages/_document.js': [ 'bundles/pages/_document.js' ],
      'bundles/pages/_error.js': [ 'bundles/pages/_error.js' ],
      'bundles/pages/_app.js': [ 'bundles/pages/_app.js' ],
      'manifest.js': [ 'static/commons/manifest.js' ],
      'bundles/pages/cm/templates/homepage.js': [ 'bundles/pages/cm/templates/homepage.js' ],
      'bundles/pages/cm/templates/news.js': [ 'bundles/pages/cm/templates/news.js' ] }
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
To reproduce the issue, I've set up a very simple example at this repo:
https://github.com/Rusticman/test-next
  1. Pull in code
  2. run `npm install`
  3. run `npm run dev`
  4. available at `localhost:3000`  
There are only two paths; `/` (root url) & `/news`. They should have the same
styling. homepage styling pulls through initially, but then fails to bundle on
subsequent navigation to and from homepage.
If you run `npm run build` & `npm run start` the homepage styling never
appears.
## Context
This issue has stopped us from adopting the latest version of next.
