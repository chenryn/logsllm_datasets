COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF ANONYMITY TECHNIQUES.
A straightforward mechanism for achieving this is Coin-
Join [79], where a set of users form a single standard Bitcoin
transaction with one input from each user and a fresh output
address controlled by each user such that no external party
examining the transaction knows which input corresponds
to which output (providing external unlinkability). Any user
can refuse to sign the transaction if their desired output
address is not
included, preventing theft but making it
vulnerable to DoS by any individual. In vanilla CoinJoin,
users announce their output address to the other users (not
providing internal unlinkability). This can be addressed
through toggling a new Tor circuit or other ad hoc methods.
For robust internal unlinkability, CoinShufﬂe [104] is an
overlay protocol for forming CoinJoin transactions through a
cryptographic mixing protocol. It also partially ((cid:3)(cid:4)) prevents
DoS by identifying which parties abort.
Two earlier proposals offer similar properties to CoinJoin,
one based on a shufﬂing network [35] and one based
on fair exchange [13]. However, both are limited to two-
party mixing making internal unlinkability impossible. To
address the difﬁculty of ﬁnding partners for two party mixing
protocols, Xim [22] is a decentralized protocol for ﬁnding
mixing partners using three stages of fees paid to miners to
discourage denial of service attacks.
Distributed mix network. In Mixcoin [26], users send
standard-sized transactions to a third-party mix and receive
back the same amount from coins submitted by other users
of the same mix. This provides anonymity toward external
entities and partial internal anonymity ((cid:3)(cid:4)), as the mix will
know the linking between users and outputs but other users
will not. Other users also cannot disrupt the protocol. While
mixes may steal Bitcoins at any time, cheating mixes can be
identiﬁed using signed warrants (providing partial (cid:3)(cid:4) theft
resistance). While Mixcoin’s warranties and other features
have not been deployed, this is the closest proposal to third-
party mixes which are most commonly used in practice [88].

similar to Chaum’s original e-cash proposal [28]. This pre-
vents an honest-but-curious mix from learning the mapping
between inputs and outputs and upgrade to full internal
unlinkability, at a cost of two additional transactions to
publish and redeem the blinded tokens.
Altcoins with integrated unlinkability. Zerocoin [81]
is a proposed altcoin with integrated unlinkability, using
a Bitcoin-like base currency and an anonymous shadow
currency called zerocoins. Users transact solely in the base
currency, but can cycle the base currency into and out of
zerocoins with anonymity relative to the set of all zerocoins
(a much larger anonymity set than the other techniques
above). This provides strong unlinkability with no theft or
DoS concerns and without relying on any entities other
than miners. However, it is not compatible with Bitcoin
and must be implemented as an altcoin (or hard fork).
PinnochioCoin [37] is a similar proposal using a different
cryptographic construction.
Zerocash [16] is an even stronger proposal for an anony-
mous altcoin. Zerocash transactions are a special type of
zero-knowledge proofs called SNARKs [17] which reveal
no information at all about the amount or recipients (except
a possible public transaction fee), enabling a completely
untraceable ledger in which no information is revealed
publicly. SNARKs are a new cryptographic primitive without
any real-world deployment to date and require an initial
generation of secret parameters by a trusted party; however,
recent work has shown this initial setup can be distributed
among a set of mutually untrusted parties [18].
CryptoNote [119] is a cryptographic mixing protocol
using ring signatures which has already been used as the
basis for several privacy-focused altcoins. Users can send
one coin by providing a one-time ring signature on a set of
k (possibly unspent) coins of their choice, which function
as an anonymity set. The one-time property ensures that
double-spend attempts can be linked to each other, resulting
in an invalid transaction. Transaction sizes are linear in k, the
size of the anonymity set of a single transaction. This scheme
has better performance but weaker anonymity compared to
Zerocoin or Zerocash.
VIII. EXTENDING BITCOIN’S FUNCTIONALITY
While Bitcoin can be described simply as a digital cur-
rency, the power of the scripting language with enforcement
by miners makes many other types of interaction possible
between two or more mutually distrusting parties that would
otherwise require a trusted intermediary. We use the term
disintermediation to refer to the general process of designing
transactions that remove the need for a trusted intermediary.
A. Disintermediation with Bitcoin today
The extent to which Bitcoin is an extensible platform
is often overstated. The scripting language remains highly
constrained. However, many protocols have been designed
for disintermediation which can be realized with Bitcoin’s
current
transaction semantics. We identify three general
disintermediation strategies:
Atomicity. In many cases, a desired security property
can be enforced directly using functionality provided by
the blockchain and the fact that transactions can be atomic,
being invalid until multiple parties sign. CoinJoin [79] is
a simple example, with no participant’s coins swapped
until all parties sign. Another example is Hearn’s “serial
micropayments” protocol [55], which makes efﬁcient use
of an out-of-band channel to allow one party to authorize
a nearly-continuous slow release of funds (e.g., a fraction
of a penny per second) in exchange for some metered
service such as Internet access. The payer can end the
protocol at any time by ceasing to sign any more trans-
actions, at which point only one transaction needs posting
to the blockchain. Another clever protocol is Nolan’s atomic
cross-chain exchange protocol, which allows users to swap
currency between two altcoins with two linked transactions
and atomic security [91].
Collateral. In other cases, when a desired security prop-
erty cannot be enforced directly, Bitcoin can provide an
acceptable remedy by posting a deposit or bond which
is only refunded in the case of correct behavior. This
approach is exempliﬁed by the multi-player lottery protocol
of Andrychowicz et al. [5]. Each of N parties places a Bk
bet, and one party (chosen at random) walks away with
BkN . In order to guarantee that a cheating player doesn’t
spoil the game by learning the outcome ﬁrst and selectively
aborting the protocol, every player must deposit BkN 2. If
any participant aborts the protocol they forfeit their deposit,
which is used to compensate the others to the maximum
amount they could have won. This approach is not limited
to lotteries, but in fact can provide a notion of fairness for
arbitrary multiparty computations [19].
Auditability. Even if Bitcoin is not used to apply an
immediate remedy against a dishonest party, it can still play
a crucial role in providing evidence that incriminates the
dishonest party. One example is green addresses [58] in
which a payment processor with a well-known public key
pledges never to sign an invalid or conﬂicting transaction.
A user who receives a transaction from a green address
may accept it (i.e., make an irrevocable decision) before
waiting for it to be included in blocks. If at some point
the transaction is preempted by a conﬂicting transaction
published in the blockchain, the user obtains easily check-
able evidence that the server cheated. A similar technique is
used in Mixcoin [26], in which semi-trusted parties provide
signed warranties which, along with the blockchain, will
provide irrefutable evidence of misbehavior.
B. Bitcoin as a data store
An alternate approach to extending Bitcoin is to use it
only as global append-only log to which anybody can write.

Secure timestamping. Because the blockchain is (modulo
forks) append-only, it can be used immediately as a secure
timestamping service [31], which is useful in a variety of
security protocols. Arbitrary data can be written into the
blockchain through several mechanisms—the community
prefers the use of a small provably unspendable script which
includes data in an unused variable.20 Multiple services
collect data from users and publish a Merkle root to the
blockchain, allowing anybody to timestamp arbitrary data.
Digital tokens: Colored Coins. Because data can be
written into individual transactions, it is possible to mark
certain transactions with a “color.” This enables a protocol
called Colored Coins [103] which deﬁnes a set of rules (not
enforced by miners) to transfer color from input transactions
to output transactions. Coins may initially be colored by
including a special signature from any authority trusted to
issue color for some application. This allows the creation
of arbitrary tokens which can be traded for each other or
for ordinary uncolored bitcoins. Colored coins have been
proposed for many applications, such as trading stocks or
property rights. Because Bitcoin miners do not enforce the
rules of the colored coins protocol, validating a transaction’s
color requires scanning the blockchain for all ancestor
transactions (precluding SPV proofs).
Colored coins use the history-tracking functionality of the
blockchain as a feature. In general, it has been observed that
every transaction output has a unique history of ancestors
which may be meaningful to different users, meaning that in
the long run bitcoins are not guaranteed to be fungible [89].
Overlay protocols: Mastercoin. A more ﬂexible ap-
proach is to use Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism but deﬁne
completely different transaction syntax (with arbitrary valid-
ity rules) to be written as arbitrary data on the blockchain.
Note that this design removes correctness property that Bit-
coin’s consensus mechanism normally provides, as Bitcoin
miners will not know about the new transaction types. Thus
invalid overlay transactions may be published and need
to be ignored by participants in the overlay system. SPV
proofs are also impossible as users must validate the entire
overlay transaction history. Two prominent such systems
are Counterparty [39] and Mastercoin [123], which deﬁne
a large number of additional transaction types for trading
digital assets and contracts.
C. Extending Bitcoin’s transaction semantics.
The Bitcoin scripting language is deliberately restrictive;
in fact, the original source contains the makings of a much
more versatile language, but most of the opcodes are marked
as unusable. In the full online version of our paper [25] we
explain and evaluate a variety of proposals such as Name-
coin [76] or Ethereum [125] to extend Bitcoin’s functionality
to provide a more versatile platform for disintermediation.
20Proof-of-burn is also a solution, but this is not provably unspendable
and so it is discouraged by miners.
IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our extensive analysis of Bitcoin based on both the
academic and (vast, fragmented) online literature shows a
renaissance of new ideas in designing a practical cryptocur-
rency, a longstanding challenge for the computer security
community. Innovation has not been limited to new cryp-
tocurrency protocol designs but has touched many areas of
computer security, distributed systems, hardware design and
economics. This is a rich and deep space and it should not
be overlooked simply because many ideas did not originate
from traditional computer science research institutes.
Yet while our knowledge has grown considerably, our un-
derstanding is often still lacking. A simple fact demonstrates
this: given the chance to design a currency system from
scratch, it is unclear what signiﬁcant deviations from Bitcoin
would be desirable or what effects they would have in prac-
tice. This is not to say Bitcoin is ﬂawless, as its many design
quirks show. There are also several areas, such as anonymity,
in which clearly superior designs have been proposed. Yet
for basic stability and efﬁciency, it remains unclear if it
is possible to design an alternate decentralized consensus
system which can improve on Bitcoin. The literature does
not even provide adequate tools to assess under which
economic and social assumptions Bitcoin itself will remain
stable. Similarly, for designing disintermediated protocols
with new features, it is not clear how to expand Bitcoin’s
functionality without upsetting its observed stability.
On the whole, we simply don’t have a scientiﬁc model
with sufﬁcient predictive power to answer questions about
how Bitcoin or related systems might fare with different
parameters or in different circumstances. Despite occasional
misgivings about academic computer science research in the
Bitcoin community, however, we advocate an important role
for research in place of simply “letting the market decide.”
It is difﬁcult today to assess the extent to which Bitcoin’s
success compared to altcoins is due to its speciﬁc design
choices as opposed to its ﬁrst-mover advantage.
Bitcoin is a rare case where practice seems to be ahead
of theory. We consider that a tremendous opportunity for
the research community to tackle the many open questions
about Bitcoin which we have laid out.
