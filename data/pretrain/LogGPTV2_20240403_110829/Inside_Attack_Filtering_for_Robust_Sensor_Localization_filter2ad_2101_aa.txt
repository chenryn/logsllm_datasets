Abstract— In this paper we address the problem of robustly
estimating the position of randomly deployed nodes of a Wireless
Sensor Network (WSN),
in the presence of security threats.
We propose a range-independent localization algorithm called
HiRLoc, that allows sensors to passively determine their location
with high resolution, without increasing the number of reference
points, or the complexity of the hardware of each reference
point. In HiRLoc, sensors determine their location based on
the intersection of the areas covered by the beacons transmitted
by multiple reference points. By combining the communication
range constraints imposed by the physical medium with computa-
tionally efﬁcient cryptographic primitives that secure the beacon
transmissions, we show that HiRLoc is robust against known
attacks on WSN, such as the wormhole attack, the Sybil attack
and compromise of network entities. Finally, our performance
evaluation shows that HiRLoc leads to a signiﬁcant improvement
in localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art range-
independent localization schemes, while requiring fewer reference
points.

I. INTRODUCTION
When wireless sensor networks (WSN) are deployed to
monitor and record a wide range of valuable information, such
as acoustic, visual, thermal, seismic, or any other type of mea-
sured observation, it is essential that sensor reports are coupled
with the location that the observation occurred. Since future
applications of WSN envision on-demand network deployment
in a self-conﬁgurable way with no pre-speciﬁed structure or
supporting infrastructure, sensors cannot know their location
apriori. Hence, sensors need to apply a localization process in
order to discover their location. This localization process must
occur during the network initialization and when the location
of the sensor changes, or, alternatively, can be applied on
demand when localization information is required by network
protocols such as, routing and security protocols [2], [12], [17].
Since sensors are intended to be low-cost disposable de-
vices, currently developed solutions such as GPS [11], are
inadequate for the hardware and power-limited sensors. Fur-
thermore, since WSN may be deployed in hostile environments
and operate in an untethered manner, they are susceptible to
a variety of attacks [9], [12], [14] that could signiﬁcantly
impact the accuracy of the localization process. Since location
information is an integral part of most wireless sensor network
services such as geographical routing [2], and applications
such as target tracking and monitoring, it is of paramount
importance to secure the localization process. While the topic
of sensor localization in a trusted environment has been
extensively studied in the literature, [1], [5], [10], [25], [26],
[30], [31], localization in the presence of malicious adversaries
remains an unexplored area of research [6], [15], [18]–[22].
In this paper we address the problem of enabling nodes of
a WSN to compute a high-resolution estimate of their location
even in the presence of malicious adversaries. This problem
will be referred to as High Resolution Secure Localization.
Since sensors are limited in hardware capabilities we pursue
solutions that do not require any special ranging hardware
at the sensor side to infer quantities such as range or angle
of arrival estimates. We refer to those solutions as range-
independent. Speciﬁcally, we consider secure localization for
wireless sensor networks in the context of, (a) decentralized
and scalable implementation, (b) resource efﬁciency in com-
putation, communication and storage, (c) range-independence,
and (d) robustness against security threats in WSN.

In this paper we make the following contributions. We
introduce a novel localization scheme for WSN called High-
resolution Range-independent Localization (HiRLoc), that al-
lows sensors to passively determine their location with high
accuracy (sensors do not
to determine their loca-
tion). The increased localization accuracy is the result of
combination of multiple localization information over a short
time period, and does not come at the expense of increased
hardware complexity or deployment of reference points with
higher density. Since our method does not perform any
range measurements to estimate the sensors’ location, it is
not susceptible to any range measurement alteration attacks.
Furthermore, sensors do not rely on other sensors to infer
their location and hence, the robustness of our localization
method does not rely on the easily tampered sensor devices.
Finally, we show that our method is robust against well known
security threats in WSN, such as the wormhole attack [12],
[28],
the Sybil attack [9], [13], [33], and compromise of
network entities. Based on our performance evaluation, we
show that HiRLoc localizes sensors with higher resolution than
previously proposed decentralized range-independent localiza-
tion schemes [3], [10], [18], [25], [26], while requiring fewer
hardware resources.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In
Section II we state our network model assumptions. Section
III describes HiRLoc and Section IV presents the security
analysis. In Section V, we provide the performance evaluation.
In Section VI we review related work and in Section VII we
present open problems and discussion. Section VIII presents
our conclusions.
II. NETWORK MODEL ASSUMPTIONS
Network deployment: We assume that a set of sensors S
with unknown location is randomly deployed with a density
ρs within an area A. We also assume that a set of specially
equipped nodes with known location1 and orientation, called
locators are also randomly deployed with a density ρL, with
ρs (cid:192) ρL.
The random deployment of the locators with a density ρL
can be modeled after a homogeneous Poisson point process of
rate ρL [8]. The random deployment of sensors with a density
ρs, can be modeled after a random sampling of the area A
with rate ρs [8]. If LHs denotes the set of locators heard by a
sensor s, i.e. being within range R from s, the probability that
s hears exactly k locators, is given by the Poisson distribution
[8]:
P (|LHs| = k) =
(ρLπR2)k
k!
e−ρLπR2
.

Note that (1) provides the probability that a randomly
locators are
chosen sensor hears k locators given that
randomly distributed and not Poisson distributed [8].
Antenna model: We assume that sensors are equipped with
omnidirectional antennas, able to transmit with maximum
power Ps, while locators are equipped with M directional
antennas with a directivity gain G > 1, and can simultaneously
transmit on each antenna with maximum power PL > Ps.2 We
also assume that locators can vary their transmission range
from zero to a maximum value of R, via power control.
Furthermore, we assume that locators can change their antenna
direction, either through changing their orientation or rotating
their directional antennas.
III. HIRLOC: HIGH-RESOLUTION RANGE-INDEPENDENT
LOCALIZATION SCHEME
In this section we present
the High-resolution Range-
independent Localization scheme (HiRLoc) that allows sensors
to determine their location with high accuracy even in the
presence of security threats. HiRLoc achieves passive sensor
localization based on beacon information transmitted from
the locators with improved resolution compared to our initial
algorithm (SeRLoc) presented in [18], [19], at the expense of
increased computational complexity and communication.
A. Location Determination
In order to determine their location, sensors rely on beacon
information transmitted from the locators. Each locator trans-
mits a beacon at each directional antenna that contains, (a)
1Position can be acquired through manual
insertion or through GPS
receivers [11]. Though GPS signals can be spoofed, knowledge of the
coordinates of several nodes is essential to generate a coordinate reference
system. An effort to secure GPS localization has been recently proposed in
[15].
2The higher transmission power at the locators is a reasonable assumption,
given that sensors are low-power devices. A typical sensor has a maximum
transmission power of Ps = 0.75mW [24]. For a homogeneous medium
with attenuation factor γ = 2 locators need to transmit with a power Pg =
75mW to achieve a communication range ratio R
r = 10, without taking into
consideration the directivity gain of the locators’ antennas.

the locator’s coordinates, (b) the angles of the sector boundary
lines deﬁned by the directional transmission, with respect to
a common global axis and, (c) the locator’s communication
range R. Locators may change their orientation over time and
retransmit beacons in order to improve the accuracy of the
location estimate. Based on the beacon information, sensors
deﬁne the sector area Si(j) as the conﬁned area covered by
the jth transmission of a locator Li.
A sensor s receiving the jth beacon transmission from
locator Li, is included within the sector area Si(j). Note that
sensors do not perform any signal strength, time of ﬂight, or
angle of arrival measurement and hence, HiRLoc is a range-
independent localization scheme. Let LHs(j) denote the set
of locators heard by a sensor s, during the jth transmission
round. By collecting beacons from the locators Li ∈ LHs(j),
the sensor can compute its location (an area rather than a
single point), as the Region of Intersection (ROI) of all the
sectors Si(j). Note that a sensor can hear beacons from
multiple locators, or multiple beacons generated by the same
the ROI after the mth round of beacon
locator. Hence,
transmissions can be expressed as the intersection of all the
sectors corresponding to the beacons available at each sensor:
m(cid:92)
|LHs(j)|(cid:92)
 .
ROI(m) =
Si(j)
(2)
j=0
i=1
Since the ROI indicates the conﬁned region where the
sensor is located, reducing the size of the ROI leads to an
increase in the localization accuracy. Based on equation (2),
we can reduce the size of the ROI by, (a) reducing the size
of the sector areas Si(j) and, (b) increase the number of
intersecting sectors Si(j).
In our previous algorithm named SeRLoc [18], [19], sen-
sors compute their location by collecting only one beacon
transmission from each locator. Since subsequent rounds of
transmissions contain identical sector information as the ﬁrst
round of transmissions, the reduction of the ROI in SeRLoc
can only be achieved by, (a) increasing the locator density
ρL so that more locators are heard at each sensor, and higher
number of sectors intersect or, (b) by using narrower antenna
sectors to reduce the size of the sectors Si(j). Both these
methods reduce the localization error at the expense of higher
number of devices with special capabilities (more locators),
and more complex hardware at each locator (more antenna
sectors).
In HiRLoc, we propose methods for reducing the ROI by
exploiting the temporal dimension, and without incurring the
costs of deploying more locators, or equipping them with
expensive antenna systems. The locators provide different
localization information at consecutive beacon transmissions
by, (a) varying the direction of their antennas and, (b) varying
the communication range of
the transmission via power
control. We now explore how both these methods lead to the
reduction of the ROI.
1. Varying the antenna orientation: The locators are capable
of transmitting at all directions (omnidirectional coverage)
using multiple directional antennas. Every antenna has a

3 , followed by a transmission of update beacons, is equivalent to equipping L1 with six directional
speciﬁc orientation and hence corresponds to a ﬁxed sector
area Si(j). The antenna orientation is expressed by the angle
information contained in the beacon θi(j) = {θi,1(j), θi,2(j)},
where θi,1(j), θi,2(j) denote the lower and upper bounds of
the sector Si(j).
Instead of reducing the size of the intersecting sectors by
narrowing the antenna beamwidth, locators can change the
orientation of their antennas and re-transmit beacons with the
new sector boundaries. A change in the antenna orientation can
occur either by changing the orientation of the locators, or by
rotation of their antenna system. A sensor collects multiple
sector information from each locator over a sequence of
transmissions: Si(j) = Si(θi(j), j), j = 1 . . . Q. As expressed
by equation (2), the intersection of a larger number of sectors
can lead to a reduction in the size of the ROI. As an example,
consider ﬁgure 1 where a sensor s hears locators L1, L2. In
ﬁgure 1(a), we show the ﬁrst round of beacon transmissions
by the locators L1, L2, and the corresponding ROI(1). In
ﬁgure 1(b), the locators L1, L2 rotate their antennas by an
angle α and transmit the second round of beacons with the
new sector boundaries.The ROI in the two rounds of beacon
transmissions, can be expressed as:

While locator L1 is out of
hence, does not further reﬁne the sensor’s location, s can
still hear locator L2 and therefore, reduce the size of the ROI.
3. Hybrid approach: The combination of the variation of
the antenna orientation and communication range leads to a
dual dependency of the sector area Si(θi(j), R(j), j). Such a
dependency can also be interpreted as a limited mobility model
for the locators. For a locator Li moving in a conﬁned area, the
antenna orientation and communication range with respect to
a static sensor varies, thus providing the sensor with multiple
sector areas Si(j). The mobility model is characterized as
limited, since the locator has to be within the range of the
sensor for at least a fraction of its transmissions in order
to provide the necessary localization information. We now
present the algorithmic details of HiRLoc.
ROI(1) = S1(1) ∩ S2(1),
ROI(2) = S1(1) ∩ S1(2) ∩ S2(1) ∩ S2(2).

B. The algorithmic details of HiRLoc
The antenna rotation can be interpreted as an increase
on the number of antenna sectors of each locator via
superposition over time. For example, consider ﬁgure 1(c),
