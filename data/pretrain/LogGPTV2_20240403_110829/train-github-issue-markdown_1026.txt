    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. Get a copy of the Go source.
    2. Set the appropriate environmental variables for compilation and issue 
    ./all.make
    What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
    The expected result is a successful compilation with all tests passing. What 
    I see is, during tests:
    --- FAIL: path.TestWalk
            1. error expected, none found
            node testdata/d/x mark = 2; expected 1
            node testdata/d/y mark = 2; expected 1
            node testdata/d/z mark = 2; expected 1
            node testdata/d/z/u mark = 2; expected 1
            node testdata/d/z/v mark = 2; expected 1
    FAIL
    What is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?
    Linux/AMD64.

    Please provide any additional information below.
    I was performing this compilation and install as root, in order to install 
    system wide into /usr/local. This might be related, but should work.
