User: How to Locate and Solve the Problem of High CPU or Memory Occupancy by Processes in Linux System?
Assistant: 1. Use the top command First, you can use the top command to view the processes with the highest CPU and memory usage in the current system. After entering the top command in the terminal, press the uppercase P key to sort by CPU usage, and press the uppercase M key to sort by memory usage. From the output results, find the process with the highest resource usage. 2. Use the ps command Another command to view the process is the ps command. You can view the CPU and memory of all current processes by entering "ps aux â€“sort=-%cpu" (sorted by CPU usage) or "ps aux -sort=-%mem" (sorted by memory usage) in the terminal Occupancy rate. 3. Use the htop command The htop command is an interactive system monitor that makes it easier to view and manage process information in the Linux system. It can display system resource usage through a graphical interface, and can manage processes through shortcut keys. 4. Use the kill command. If you find that a process occupies too much CPU or memory, you can use the kill command to terminate the process. Enter "kill -9 process ID" in the terminal to terminate the process. However, it should be noted that using the kill command will directly forcibly kill the process, which may affect the system. 5. Locating the problem If you find that a process often occupies too much CPU or memory, you can use tools such as strace or gdb to track and analyze it to find out the problem. In addition, you can further locate the cause of resource occupation by viewing logs or system reports. 6. Optimizing system configuration For the frequent problems of high process usage, you can also consider optimizing system configuration, such as increasing physical memory, adjusting process priority, upgrading hardware, etc., to reduce system load.
