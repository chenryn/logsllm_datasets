teresting dynamics. Figure 1 shows the set of banks processing Visa
payment transactions for the afﬁliate programs we purchased from
over two years: one graph for pharmaceutical programs, the other
for OEM software. Each row corresponds to a bank and each point
on a row corresponds to a purchase from an afﬁliate program that
authorized using that bank; the parenthetical number next to the
bank name denotes the number of purchases that bank processed.
We display the rows of banks in increasing time order of appear-
ance in our data set. Finally, the lines show our estimate of when

Glavmed afﬁliate program contracted with a range of payment ser-
vice providers, many of them were unable to provide reliable ser-
vice and were only used brieﬂy [11].

Table 1: Summary of order data set for pharmaceutical and OEM
software afﬁliate programs. Each program shows the number of
successful authorizations (“Auths”) vs. the number of orders that
were refused before authorization (“Refs”). ∗These afﬁliate pro-
grams are named for the most popular storefront “brand”, not their
ofﬁcial names.
a bank is actively engaged in supporting afﬁliate programs. We
connect points on a row with a line if successive purchases from
any program used the same bank within two months (this cutoff
is somewhat arbitrary, but is responsive to our typical purchasing
interval of one month). For larger time periods, we assume that a
given bank is not being used by the program. In reality, either we
did not make purchases from programs using the bank, or programs
stopped using the bank during that time; we do not have the obser-
vations to distinguish.
For the pharmaceutical afﬁliate programs in Figure 1(a), we see
that activity is concentrated in a relatively small number of banks.
When purchasing from all of the afﬁliate programs, most of the
purchases go through just twelve banks with the remaining banks
processing fewer than ten purchases. Further, the set of concen-
trated banks shifts over time. In the ﬁrst half of our data set afﬁliate
programs concentrate credit card processing in Azerigazbank and
Bank Standard in Azerbaijan and DnB Nord Banka in Latvia. How-
ever, in mid-February of 2011 DnB Nord Banka terminates virtu-
ally all such merchant accounts (the parent company DnB Nord
released this statement, “We bought a bank this winter which a cus-
tomer engaged in spam activity. This company is no longer one of
our customers.” [2]), and Azerigazbank is used far less frequently
after being identiﬁed in [10].
In the second half, credit card processing continues with Bank
Standard but otherwise shifts to Latvijas Pasta Banka, the State
Bank of Mauritius and two Georgian banks, TBC and Liberty. In
the past few months processing shifts from Bank Standard to the In-
ternational Bank of Azerbaijan and some programs move from the

State Bank of Mauritius to two Chinese banks, the Bank of China
and the Agricultural Bank of China. For banks such as Global Pay-
ments, Rodovid, Raffeisenbank, Intercard, and Wirecard, we see
them processing credit cards for just one or two purchases at one
point in time. Again, we suspect that these represent situations
where afﬁliate programs were experimenting with new banks for
credit card processing, but the bank relationship did not succeed.
Bank activity for software afﬁliate programs shows similar be-
havior, yet is even more pronounced than with pharmaceuticals.
Initially just four banks handle processing for purchases from 13
software programs: Latvijas Pasta Banka, Latvijas Krajbanka, BIN
Bank, and B+S Card Service. In late November 2011, though, we
see processing gradually expand to eleven new banks, with three
of the old banks having disappeared completely (Latvijas Pasta
Banka, Latvijas Krajbanka, and BIN Bank). This sudden change
corresponds to two unrelated events. First, Latvijas Krajbanka be-
came embroiled in a major Baltic banking crisis caused by the na-
tionalization of Bankas Snoras (due to massive fraud). Second, at
roughly the same time, a major software manufacturer executed
a comprehensive series of targeted complaints against merchant
accounts used to receive payment for online counterfeit software
sales. This campaign is ultimately very successful, corroborated by
the large number of payment refusals we see starting at this time
period as well (explained in more detail in Section 4.4).
4.2 How programs use banks
In the previous analysis, we collapsed all afﬁliate programs to-
gether. Next we examine the dynamics of these relationships: how
distinct programs are distributed and concentrated among the banks,
and how these relationships change over time.
As per Section 2.2, there can be a number of relationships be-
tween an afﬁliate program and the merchant account receiving its
Visa transactions. In most cases a given merchant account, as rep-
resented by the merchant ID, is uniquely used by a given program.
For example, the 33Drugs program (aka DrugRevenue) uniquely
used a particular account (3755600) with the Latvian bank Pasta
Banka for over a year, an account with the merchant descriptor
“33medscom1877340891”.
There are a small number of cases in which different programs
may share accounts—either because they are really are co-owned,
or because they use a third-party payment processor who factors
their purchases through a set of managed accounts. We have seen

examples of both behaviors. For example, the Rx-Partners and Sti-
mul-cash programs consistently use the same accounts over the en-
tire duration of our study. The reason for this sharing is that the
Stimul-cash program was acquired by the owners of Rx-Partners
(roughly in 2008) and thus shares back-end processing.12 Conversely,
we see a large number of distinct OEM software afﬁliate programs
using the same accounts at Pasta Banka in early 2011, but using
different accounts at other periods (suggesting a shared third-party
payment provider during the time of sharing).13
With this in mind, Figure 2 expands the data shown in Figure 1(a)
by identifying which afﬁliate programs processed payments using
12However, less obviously, the OXOPharm afﬁliate program also
shares the same accounts. This could be because the three share
a payment provider or because there is some undisclosed business
relationship between the two.
13We also ﬁnd short-lived sharing arrangements indicative of shared
third-party processing between Glavmed and World Pharmacy (Az-
erigazbank), Glavmed and Dr. Bucks (Bank Standard and Interna-
tional Bank of Azerbaijan), Private-partners and RxCash (Liberty
Bank), ZedCash and Stevna (Pasta Banka), CashAdmin, Greenline
and PharmCash (Agricultural Bank of China), as well as Greenline
and and TopOEM (Wells Fargo).
the various banks: for each bank we include a row for each afﬁl-
iate program that used its services for acquiring. Note that many
programs used multiple banks over time, and so rows for the same
program appear under multiple banks (behavior we explore further
in Section 4.3). Once again, we connect points with a line if suc-
cessive purchases occured within a two-month window to suggest
continuous support by a bank for that program. For instance, we
placed 13 orders from sites sponsored by Meds Partners between
July 2011 and July 2012 that were processed through the State
Bank of Mauritius; these purchases are shown as a line connect-
ing three points on the Meds Partners row for that bank. Finally, we
sort the banks in decreasing order of the number of programs that
use a bank, and only show banks used by at least four programs.
Here we see the coordinated movements that explain some of
the previous changes in bank “popularity”. For example, a series
of programs including most of the biggest players—Rx-Partners,
Stimul-cash, OXOPharm, Mailien, Glavmed and Rx-Promotion—
all transfer in February of 2011 from processing payments through
Azerigazbank to Bank Standard, and move again within Baku to the
International Bank of Azerbaijan for periods in late 2011. This level
of synchronicity suggests the use of a shared payment provider
among these actors. Conversely, there are particular programs that

establish unique relationships with banks, such as ZedCash which
moves all of its processing (including replica and herbal sales) to
Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China with whom it con-
tinues to operate today. Finally, State Bank of Mauritius and the two
Georgian banks, TBC and Libery, come to dominate the “mid-tier”
of pharmaceutical programs starting in roughly August of 2011.
For software afﬁliate programs (graph not shown), we found that
most programs process orders simultaneously through four banks
(again suggesting a shared third-party processor) until November
2011 when the programs all scramble to ﬁnd alternate payment ar-
rangements (Sections 4.4 and 4.5).
4.3 Program banking strategies
Programs use different strategies for managing payment process-
ing that vary in terms of overhead and risk management. Figure 3
shows examples of four strategies among pharmaceutical programs.
For each program, we show rows corresponding to individual mer-
chant descriptors (text strings that are provided to the issuer and
would appear on the customer’s payment card statement) used to
process the credit cards for the orders we placed through the pro-
gram. Each merchant descriptor corresponds to a “terminal”, a spe-
ciﬁc merchant account at a bank tied to processing orders with a
speciﬁc merchant category code (MCC).14 We plot points on a row
for the purchases we made that were processed using that speciﬁc
terminal. Since each terminal is tied to a speciﬁc bank, we mark
