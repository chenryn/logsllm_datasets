### 82 Accesses of This Type

#### Spammers
One of the primary capabilities of webmail accounts is sending emails. Previous research has shown that large spamming botnets often incorporate code in their bots and command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure to exploit this capability. These bots directly connect to webmail accounts to send spam [30]. We categorize any access that sends an email as a "spammer" type. Our observations revealed that only 8 accounts recorded such activity, indicating that spamming is not a primary use for stolen accounts obtained through the outlets we studied.

#### Hijackers
A stealthy cybercriminal typically maintains a low profile when accessing a stolen account to avoid detection by the legitimate owner. However, less cautious attackers may simply lock the legitimate owner out by changing the account's password. We refer to these accesses as "hijackers." In total, we observed 36 such accesses. A password change prevents us from scraping the visitor activity page, thus limiting our ability to gather further information about the accesses performed on that account.

It is important to note that the categories we have described are not mutually exclusive. For example, an attacker might use an account to send spam emails, thereby falling into the "spammer" category, and then change the password, placing them in the "hijacker" category. Such overlaps were common in the accesses recorded in our honey accounts. Notably, no access was exclusively a "spammer"; miscreants who sent spam also acted as "hijackers" or "gold diggers," searching for sensitive information in the account.

### Distribution of Access Types

To understand the distribution of different types of accesses in accounts leaked through various means, we analyzed the data. Figure 1 illustrates this distribution. As shown, cybercriminals who gain access to stolen accounts through malware tend to be the most stealthy, never locking the legitimate users out of their accounts. Instead, they limit their activities to verifying the credentials or searching for sensitive information in the account inbox, possibly to estimate the account's value.

Accounts leaked through paste sites and underground forums, on the other hand, see a significant presence of "hijackers." Specifically, 20% of the accesses to accounts leaked through paste sites fall into this category. Accounts leaked through underground forums show the highest percentage of "gold digger" accesses, with about 30% of all accesses belonging to this category.

### Activity on Honey Accounts

#### 4.3.1 Duration of Accesses
For each cookie identifier, we recorded the first and last times it appeared in a particular honey account, denoted as \( t_0 \) and \( t_{\text{last}} \), respectively. The duration of activity for each cookie was calculated as \( t_{\text{last}} - t_0 \). It is important to note that \( t_{\text{last}} \) is a lower bound, as we cease to obtain information about cookies if the honey account's password is changed. Figure 2 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the length of unique accesses for different types of attackers. Most accesses are very short, lasting only a few minutes and never returning. "Spammer" accesses, in particular, tend to send emails in bursts and then disconnect. "Hijacker" and "gold digger" accesses, however, have a long tail, with about 10% of accesses returning over several days. The CDF indicates that most "curious" accesses are repeated over many days, suggesting that cybercriminals frequently return to check for new information in the accounts. This contrasts with the findings in [13], which state that most cybercriminals connect to a compromised webmail account once, within a few minutes, to assess its value. However, [13] focused only on accounts compromised via phishing pages, while our study covers a broader range of methods.

#### 4.3.2 Time Between Leak and First Access
We also examined the time elapsed between the leak of credentials and the first recorded access by cybercriminals. Figure 3 presents a CDF of this time for accounts leaked through different outlets. Within the first 25 days after a leak, we recorded 80% of all unique accesses to accounts leaked to paste sites, 60% to accounts leaked to underground forums, and 40% to accounts leaked to malware. An interesting observation is the nature of unique accesses to accounts leaked to malware. Figure 3 reveals rapid increases in unique accesses to honey accounts leaked to malware, approximately 30 days and 100 days after the leak, indicated by two sharp inflection points.

Figure 4 provides more insight into these patterns. It shows the unique accesses to each of our honey accounts over time. Accounts leaked on public outlets like forums and paste sites can be accessed by multiple cybercriminals simultaneously. In contrast, credentials leaked through malware are initially available only to the botmaster who stole them, until they decide to sell or share them. The bursts in accesses to accounts leaked through malware months after the leak suggest that the same criminal revisited the accounts or that the accounts were sold on the underground market. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that these bursts were of the "gold digger" type, while previous accesses to the same accounts were of the "curious" type.

#### System Configuration of Accesses
Figure 4 also shows that the majority of accounts leaked to paste sites were accessed within a few days of the leak, while a subset was not accessed for more than 2 months. This subset refers to the ten credentials we leaked to Russian paste sites. The corresponding honey accounts were not accessed for more than 2 months, indicating either a lack of cybercriminals on Russian paste sites or a disbelief in the authenticity of the accounts.

We observed a wide variety of system configurations for the accesses across groups of leaked accounts, using Google's system fingerprinting information. As shown in Figure 5a, accesses to accounts leaked on paste sites were made through a variety of popular browsers, with Firefox and Chrome leading. Many accesses came from unknown browsers, likely due to attackers hiding browser information. About 50% of accesses to accounts leaked through paste sites were not identifiable. Chrome and Firefox also led in groups leaked in underground forums, but with less variety. All accesses to accounts in malware groups were from unknown browsers, indicating that these cybercriminals were more stealthy. Analyzing operating systems, we found that accounts leaked through malware mostly received accesses from Windows computers, followed by Mac OS X and Linux (Figure 5b). Paste sites and underground forum groups showed a wider range of operating systems, with more than 50% of computers running Windows. Android devices were also used to connect to the honey accounts in these groups.

The diversity of devices and browsers in the paste sites and underground forums groups suggests a mix of cybercriminals with various motives and capabilities, compared to the more homogeneous malware groups. Attackers who steal credentials through malware make more efforts to cover their tracks by evading browser fingerprinting.

#### Location of Accesses
We recorded location information from the accesses logged by our infrastructure to understand patterns in the locations (or proxies) used by criminals. Out of 326 accesses, 132 came from Tor exit nodes. Specifically, 28 accesses to accounts leaked on paste sites, 48 to accounts leaked on forums, and 56 to accounts leaked through malware (all except one) were made via Tor. After removing Tor nodes, 173 unique accesses presented location information. We used Google's geolocation to determine this information and observed accesses from 29 countries. We checked all IP addresses against the Spamhaus blacklist and found 20 IP addresses in the blacklist, likely belonging to malware-infected machines.

We aimed to observe if cybercriminals attempt to evade location-based login risk analysis systems by tweaking access origins. Despite 57 accesses to honey accounts leaked through malware, all but one originated from Tor exit nodes, indicating that malware operators prefer anonymizing systems over modifying their location based on the account's typical connection location.

When leaking honey credentials, we chose London and Pontiac, MI, as decoy UK and US locations, respectively. To avoid suspicion, we selected decoy locations such that London and Pontiac, IL, were the midpoints. To assess the impact of location information on the locations from which cybercriminals connected, we calculated the median distances of the locations recorded in unique accesses from the midpoints of the advertised decoy locations. Figures 6a and 6b show that connections to accounts with advertised location information originate from places closer to the midpoints than accounts with only usernames and passwords. For example, connections to accounts leaked on paste sites with UK location information had a median circle radius of 1400 kilometers, compared to 1784 kilometers for accounts without location information. Similar results were observed for US accounts, with connections to accounts leaked on paste sites with US location information clustered around the US midpoint (radius 939 kilometers) compared to 7900 kilometers for accounts without location information.

In summary, our findings indicate that the behavior and tactics of cybercriminals vary depending on the outlet through which they obtain stolen credentials. Malware operators are more stealthy and use anonymizing systems, while those accessing accounts through paste sites and forums are more diverse and less cautious.
