82 accesses of this type.
Spammers. One of the main capabilities of webmail
accounts is sending emails. Previous research showed
that large spamming botnets have code in their bots
and in their C&C infrastructure to take advantage of
this capability, by having the bots directly connect to
such accounts and send spam [30]. We consider accesses
to belong to this category if they send any email. We
observed 8 accounts of this type that recorded such ac-
cesses. This low number of accounts shows that send-
ing spam appears not to be one of the main purposes
that cybercriminals use stolen accounts for, when stolen
through the outlets that we studied.
Hijackers. A stealthy cybercriminal is likely to keep
a low proﬁle when accessing a stolen account, to avoid
raising suspicion from the account’s legitimate owner.
Less concerned miscreants, however, might just act to
lock the legitimate owner out of their account by chang-
ing the account’s password. We call these accesses “hi-
jackers.” In total, we observed 36 accesses of this type.
A change of password prevents us from scraping the vis-
itor activity page, and therefore we are unable to col-
lect further information about the accesses performed
to that account.
It is important to note that the taxonomy classes that
we described are not exclusive. For example, an at-
tacker might use an account to send spam emails, there-
fore falling in the “spammer” category, and then change
the password of that account, therefore falling into the
“hijacker” category. Such overlaps happened often for
the accesses recorded in our honey accounts. It is in-
teresting to note that there was no access that behaved
exclusively as “spammer.” Miscreants that sent spam
through our honey accounts also acted as “hijackers” or
as “gold diggers,” searching for sensitive information in
the account.
We wanted to understand the distribution of diﬀerent
types of accesses in accounts that were leaked through
diﬀerent means. Figure 1 shows a breakdown of this
distribution. As it can be seen, cybercriminals who
get access to stolen accounts through malware are the
stealthiest, and never lock the legitimate users out of
their accounts.
Instead, they limit their activity to
checking if such credentials are real or searching for sen-
sitive information in the account inbox, perhaps in an
attempt to estimate the value of the accounts. Accounts
leaked through paste sites and underground forums see
the presence of “hijackers.” 20% of the accesses to ac-
counts leaked through paste sites, in particular, belong
Figure 1: Distribution of types of accesses for diﬀerent
credential leak accesses. As it can be seen, most accesses
belong to the “curious” category. It is possible to spot
diﬀerences in the types of activities for diﬀerent leak
outlets. For example, accounts leaked by malware do
not present activity of “hijacker” type. Hijackers, on the
other hand, are particularly common among miscreants
who obtain stolen credentials through paste sites.

ferent types of activity on our honey accounts. The vast
majority of unique accesses lasts a few minutes. Spam-
mers tend to use accounts aggressively for a short time
and then disconnect. The other types of accesses, and
in particular “curious” ones, come back after some time,
likely to check for new activity in the honey accounts.
to this category. Accounts leaked through underground
forums, on the other hand, see the highest percentage
of “gold digger” accesses, with about 30% of all accesses
belonging to this category.
4.3 Activity on honey accounts
In the following, we provide detailed analysis on the
unique accesses that we recorded for our honey accounts.
4.3.1 Duration of accesses
For each cookie identiﬁer, we recorded the time that
the cookie ﬁrst appeared in a particular honey account
as t0, and the last time it appeared in the honey ac-
count as tlast. From this information, we computed the
duration of activity of each cookie as tlast−t0. It is nec-
essary to note that tlast of each cookie is a lower bound,
since we cease to obtain information about cookies if the

dentials leaks and the ﬁrst visit by a cookie. Accounts
leaked through paste sites receive on average accesses
earlier than accounts leaked through other outlets.
password of the honey account that is recording cookies
is changed, for instance. Figure 2 shows the Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of the length of unique ac-
cesses of diﬀerent types of attackers. As it can be seen,
the vast majority of accesses are very short, lasting only
a few minutes and never coming back. “Spammer” ac-
cesses, in particular, tend to send emails in burst for
a certain period and then disconnect. “Hijacker” and
“gold digger” accesses, on the other hand, have a long
tail of about 10% accesses that keep coming back for
several days in a row. The CDF shows that most “cu-
rious” accesses are repeated over many days, indicating
that the cybercriminals keep coming back to ﬁnd out
if there is new information in the accounts. This con-
ﬂicts with the ﬁnding in [13], which states that most
cybercriminals connect to a compromised webmail ac-
count once, to assess its value within a few minutes.
However, [13] focused only on accounts compromised
via phishing pages, while we look at a broader range
of ways in which criminals can obtain such credentials.
Our results show that the modes of operation of cy-
bercriminals vary, depending on the outlets they obtain
stolen credentials from.
4.3.2 Time between leak and ﬁrst access
We then studied how long it takes after credentials
are leaked on diﬀerent outlets until our infrastructure
records accesses from cybercriminals. Figure 3 reports
a CDF of the time between leak and ﬁrst access for
accounts leaked through diﬀerent outlets. As it can be
seen, within the ﬁrst 25 days after leak, we recorded
80% of all unique accesses to accounts leaked to paste
sites, 60% of all unique accesses to accounts leaked to
underground forums, and 40% of all unique accesses to
accounts leaked to malware. A particularly interesting
observation is the nature of unique accesses to accounts
leaked to malware. A close look at Figure 3 reveals
rapid increases in unique accesses to honey accounts

also after 100 days, indicated by two sharp inﬂection
points.
Figure 4 sheds more light into what happened at
those points. The ﬁgure reports the unique accesses
to each of our honey accounts over time. An interesting
aspect to note is that accounts that are leaked on public
outlets such as forum and paste sites can be accessed
by multiple cybercriminals at the same time. Account
credentials leaked through malware, on the other hand,
are available only to the botmaster that stole them, un-
til they decide to sell them or to give them to some-
one else. Seeing bursts in accesses to accounts leaked
through malware months after the actual leak happened
could indicate that the accounts were visited again by
the same criminal who operated the malware infrastruc-
ture, or that the accounts were sold on the underground
market and that another miscreant is now using them.
This hypothesis is somewhat conﬁrmed by the fact that
these bursts in accesses were of the “gold digger” type,
while all previous accesses to the same accounts were of
the “curious” type.
System conﬁguration of accesses
In addition, Figure 4 shows that the majority of ac-
counts leaked to paste sites were accessed within a few
days of leak, while a particular subset was not accessed
for more than 2 months. That subset refers to the ten
credentials we leaked to Russian paste sites. The cor-
responding honey accounts were not accessed for more
than 2 months from the time of leak. This either indi-
cates that cybercriminals are not many on the Russian
paste sites, or maybe they did not believe that the ac-
counts were real, thus not bothering to access them.
4.3.3
We observed a wide variety of system conﬁgurations
for the accesses across groups of leaked accounts, by
leveraging Google’s system ﬁngerprinting information
available to us inside the honey accounts. As shown
in Figure 5a, accesses to accounts leaked on paste sites
were made through a variety of popular browsers, with
Firefox and Chrome taking the lead. We also recorded
many accesses from unknown browsers.
It is possible
for an attacker to hide browser information from Google
servers by presenting an empty user agent and hiding
other ﬁngerprintable information [27]. About 50% of
accesses to accounts leaked through paste sites were
not identiﬁable. Chrome and Firefox take the lead in
groups leaked in underground forums as well, but there
is less variety of browsers there.
Interestingly, all ac-
cesses to accounts in malware groups were made from
unknown browsers. This shows that cybercriminals that
accessed groups leaked through malware were stealth-
ier than others. While analyzing the operating systems
used by criminals, we observed that honey accounts
leaked through malware mostly received accesses from
Windows computers, followed by Mac OS X and Linux.
This is shown in Figure 5b. In the paste sites and un-
derground forum groups, we observe a wider range of
Figure 4: Plot of duration between time of leak and
unique accesses in accounts leaked through diﬀerent
outlets. As it can be seen, accounts leaked to mal-
ware experience a sudden increase in unique accesses
after 30 days and 100 days from the leak, indicating
that they may have been sold or transferred to some
other party by the cybercriminals behind the malware
command and control infrastructure.
operating systems. More than 50% of computers in the
three categories ran on Windows.
It is interesting to
note that Android devices were also used to connect
to the honey accounts in paste sites and underground
forum groups.
The diversity of devices and browsers in the paste
sites and underground forums groups indicates a mot-
ley mix of cybercriminals with various motives and ca-
pabilities, compared to the malware groups that appear
to be more homogeneous. It is also obvious that attack-
ers that steal credentials through malware make more
eﬀorts to cover their tracks by evading browser ﬁnger-
printing.
4.3.4 Location of accesses
We recorded the location information that we found
in the accesses that were logged by our infrastructure.
Our goal was to understand patterns in the locations
(or proxies) used by criminals to access stolen accounts.
Out of the 326 accesses logged, 132 were coming from
Tor exit nodes. More speciﬁcally, 28 accesses to ac-
counts leaked on paste sites were made via Tor, out of a
total of 144 accesses to accounts leaked on paste sites.
48 accesses to accounts leaked on forums were made
through Tor, out of a total of 125 accesses made to ac-
counts leaked on forums. We observed 57 accesses to
accounts leaked through malware, and all except one of
those accesses were made via Tor. We removed these ac-
cesses for further analysis, since they do not provide in-
formation on the physical location of the criminals. Af-
ter removing Tor nodes, 173 unique accesses presented

accesses

location information. To determine this location infor-
mation, we used the geolocation provided by Google on
the account activity page of the honey accounts. We
observed accesses from a total of 29 countries. To un-
derstand whether the IP addresses that connected to
our honey accounts had been recorded in previous ma-
licious activity, we ran checks on all IP addresses we
observed against the Spamhaus blacklist. We found
20 IP addresses that accessed our honey accounts in the
Spamhaus blacklist. Because of the nature of this black-
list, we believe that the addresses belong to malware-
infected machines that were used by cybercriminals to
connect to the stolen accounts.
One of our goals was to observe if cybercriminals at-
tempt to evade location-based login risk analysis sys-
tems by tweaking access origins. In particular, we wanted
to assess whether telling criminals the location where
the owner of an account is based inﬂuences the loca-
tions that they will use to connect to the account. De-
spite observing 57 accesses to our honey accounts leaked
through malware, we discovered that all these connec-
tions except one originated from Tor exit nodes. This
shows that the malware operators that accessed our ac-
counts prefer to hide their location through the use of
anonymizing systems rather than modifying their lo-
cation based on where the stolen account is typically
connecting from.
While leaking the honey credentials, we chose Lon-
don and Pontiac, MI as our decoy UK and US locations
respectively. The idea was to claim that the honey ac-
counts leaked with location details belonged to ﬁctitious
personas living in either London or Pontiac. However,
we realized that leaking multiple accounts with the same
location might cause suspicion. As a result, we chose de-
coy UK and US locations such that London and Pontiac,
IL were the midpoints of those locations respectively.
To observe the impact of availability of location in-
formation about the honey accounts on the locations
that cybercriminals connect from, we calculated the
median values of distances of the locations recorded
in unique accesses, from the midpoints of the adver-
tised decoy locations in our account leaks. For exam-
ple, for the accesses A to honey accounts leaked on
paste sites, advertised with UK information, we ex-
tracted location information, translated them to coor-
dinates LA, and computed the dist paste U K vector as
distance(LA, midU K), where midU K are London’s co-
ordinates. All distances are in kilometers. We extracted
the median values of all distance vectors obtained, and
plotted circles on UK and US maps, specifying those
median distances as radii of the circles, as shown in
Figures 6a and 6b.
Interestingly, we observe that connections to accounts
with advertised location information originate from places
closer to the midpoints than accounts with leaked infor-
mation containing usernames and passwords only. Fig-
ure 6a shows that connections to accounts leaked on
paste sites and forums result in the smaller median cir-
cles, that is, the connections originate from locations
closer to London, the UK midpoint. The smallest circle
is for the accounts leaked on paste sites, with adver-
tised UK location information (radius 1400 kilometers).
In contrast, the circle of accounts leaked on paste sites
without location information has a radius of 1784 kilo-
meters. The median circle of the accounts leaked in
underground forums, with no advertised location infor-
mation, is the largest circle in Figure 6a, while the one
of accounts leaked in underground forums, along with
UK location information, is smaller.
We obtained similar results in the US plot, with some
interesting distinctions. As shown in Figure 6b, con-
nections to honey accounts leaked on paste sites, with
advertised US locations are clustered around the US
midpoint, as indicated by the circle with a radius of
939 kilometers, compared to the median circle of ac-
counts leaked on paste sites without location informa-
tion, which has a radius of 7900 kilometers. However,
despite the fact that the median circle of accounts leaked
in underground forums with advertised location infor-
mation is less than that of the one without advertised
location information, the diﬀerence in their radii is not
as pronounced. This again supports the indication that

As it can be seen, account credentials leaked with location information attract logins from hosts that are closer to
