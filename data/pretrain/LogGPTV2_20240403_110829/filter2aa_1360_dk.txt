Private Sector: Although the intelligence units in larger firms are looking for specific experience and 
educational backgrounds, there are other departments, such as loss prevention, which can be a foot in 
the door. The requirements tend to be lower but still include opportunities to build and use investigative 
skillsets. These types of positions may not be your end-goal, but they are a step in the right direction.
• 
Create a Program: If you already work at an organization which does not have an OSINT function 
but could benefit from one, you might consider writing a proposal for adding that capability. Put 
together a demonstration for management and make sure to include success stories using OSINT. 
Think outside the box and understand that it will take time to gain traction.
Some of the most important skills in this line of work can be non-specific to our field. The ability to organize 
information and communicate well, both verbally and in written form, are indispensable. There are very few 
assignments or contracts which do not involve generating some type of written report. You can be the best 
researcher and investigator in the world. However, being unable to package and present your findings in an 
understandable and professional fashion will prevent you from successful employment. Working to improve 
your written and verbal communication skills cannot be emphasized enough. Your resume is essentially an 
intelligence report representing your own capabilities. Make sure it is concise, well organized, thoughtful, and 
free of errors.
Experience is arguably the most valuable resume item and yet it is probably the most difficult qualification to 
gain. Many new analysts and investigators run into the chicken-and-the-egg issue. Most employers are only 
looking to hire experienced professionals, but it is difficult to gain experience until you are employed. There are 
several paths to gaining experience, but some will require managing your expectations or adopting a non- 
traditional approach. I have seen colleagues and students successfully build experience in the following ways.
Building a Program
510 Chapter 31
• 
Articulate that an OSINT capability is an
teams to increase efficiencies and success. A small 
more than hundreds of untrained investigators.
• 
Articulate how increased situational awareness will reduce liability and risk. Field operators will have 
better intelligence for critical incidents which enhance the chances for positive outcomes.
• 
Propose a timeline and metric for measuring success.
• 
Estimate equipment, training, and staffing costs to begin the project. Consider utilizing low-cost 
alternatives such as surplus equipment. Early in my career, a fair amount of OSINT work was conducted 
on previously seized laptops and recycled desktops.
• 
Prepare a sample policy and standard operating procedures.
• 
Prepare a communications, documentation, and approval plan.
• 
Research location options for the team if it needs to be centralized.
The first step should be crafting a proposal which demonstrates the return on an investment from bodies and 
operating budget toward an expanded capability. The content of your proposal will depend somewhat on your 
specific organization and field. Consider the following.
Management tends to be most concerned about risk and cost. Your proposal should contain credible research 
to support die argument that public and private entities are employing dedicated open source intelligence teams 
to reduce risk and improve performance. Provide them with a prepared logistics plan and expect management 
to have reservations and objections. Convince your audience that they are behind the curve, but have the 
opportunity to lead the pack. If you are successful, control your expectations and understand that management 
will likely make their own changes to your plan. The goal is to establish a foothold. Understand that a fully 
capable OSINT unit will take time to develop.
• 
Volunteer: Find a person, team, or organization that does this type of work and volunteer to assist 
them whatever possible. If you can pass a background check, and you are able to work for free, unpaid 
internships are fantastic opportunities which can lead to full-time employment. This can often be at the 
same organization.
• 
The Entrepreneur: This is the path that I do not typically recommend. However, it is the most 
common. Starting your own company, or picking up a private-investigations license with little to no 
experience, is not likely to get you very far. If you are early in your career, you are better served 
surrounding yourself with experienced peers in order to benefit from their knowledge and learn from 
their mistakes.
Some of you may already be working in the intelligence or investigations field, but are looking to expand your 
capabilities. Others may be looking to make a pitch to your boss for more staffing and resources. Building an 
OSINT program or team can be challenging, but the following are recommendations based upon my own 
experiences.
industry standard and most agencies are using specialized 
team of well-trained investigators will contribute
Even if you are inexperienced, the ability' to work as a team, eagerness to learn, and a strong work ethic are the 
qualities most employers seek in new hires. Wherever you build your experience, start creating a reputation as 
being someone excited to learn and willing to do menial tasks to support the mission. Early in your career, expect 
to do a lot of work that is outside of your area of interest. If you expect to be paid well to do interesting tasks, 
but you have little work experience, you are probably going to be disappointed. I have worked many assignments 
and roles which had very little to do with the intelligence field but were invaluable experiences. Be gracious, 
patient, eager to learn, and those disinteresting entry-level positions and internships will turn into something 
resembling a gratifying career.
OSINT Specific Training
and instructors.
Policy, Ethics, & Development 511
Where do live courses, bootcamps, and other premium training programs come in? If you or your employer 
have a healthy budget for training, and you have less time to spend doing your own research, premium training 
may be worth the investment. For most people, live, hands-on training is the fastest way to learn something new 
or to improve existing skills. Live courses tend to be quite expensive. The area between live training and self­
study is where online video training resides. It affords the opportunity to watch concepts and tactics 
demonstrated, but often lacks the hands-on labs common to live sessions. You can do a lot with a book and 
determination. Having a dedicated instructor and more materials just gets you there quicker.
IntelTechniques provides a variety of training tools, including this book which is affordable for almost anyone. 
For those who want to accelerate their learning curve, there is online video training at IntelTechniques.net. If 
you are looking for hands on instruction, we also offer live training sessions. Regardless of your budget and 
goals, make sure to do your research before settling on a training program. There are dozens of OSINT "experts" 
claiming to have the best courses and techniques. Use the research techniques in this book to get a peek at 
previously released content or to find communities where people are discussing the courses 
Identify your goals, do your research, and execute the work to get where you want to be.
Learning and honing any skill takes time. The length of time depends on your level of focus and interest, but 
this can be greatly influenced by the quality of learning materials. I believe that someone who is motivated can 
learn just about anything on a near zero budget if they are willing to devote time, attention, and dedication. 
Materials such as paid courses, and even this book, simply do the research for you and accelerate the learning 
process. Therefore, a good learning strategy takes advantage of the resources you have available.
For those with a tight budget, you should expect to do a lot of research and self-learning. However, there are 
many benefits to this. Autodidactic learning is the process of figuring out something or solving a problem on 
your own. Conducting your own problem solving can make you a stronger investigator. Performing 
investigations and gathering intelligence are often exercises in problem solving. When we are given all the 
answers, we do not strengthen those important areas of our brains. The beauty of open source intelligence is 
that it builds upon itself. We are learning to get better at conducting online research, which is a skillset that we 
can use to locate new techniques for improving our online research. This book, a browser, and determination 
can get you quite far towards building your own solid skillset.
512 Conclusion
Co n c l u s io n
Thank you for reading. ~MB
Finally, remember that each of these investigation techniques could be used against you. When you find your 
own information exposed, take action to protect yourself. Personal defense against OSINT is as important as 
offense. If you would like to stay updated on these topics, please consider my other book, Extreme Privacy: 
What It Takes To Disappear.
I hope the techniques presented have sparked your interest in finding new avenues of research and 
investigations. With patience and diligent effort, this book will be a helpful reference guide to assist in 
performing more accurate and efficient searches of open source intelligence.
Permanently documenting these techniques on paper may will provide outdated content. Technology changes 
quickly and methods must adapt to keep up. Ten years from now, this book may be an amusing piece about 
how we once managed our online data. To keep up to date with the changes in various OSINT strategies, please 
subscribe to my free podcast, The Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show, at inteltechniques.com; view my blog at 
inteltechniques.com/blog; or monitor my Twitter account at twitter.com/IntelTechniques. The chances are 
good that as you read this, new content has been posted about the very topic you are researching.
With this book, I am passing the torch. YOU now have the search tools. As you find new resources and modify 
your files, let the community know over Twitter or other networks. When you configure a new Linux application 
in your custom virtual machine, tell us how you did it. When an online OSINT service disappears, I am eager 
to hear how you resolve the issue. I am truly excited to see how we all adapt to the impending OSINT changes 
sure to come.
Conclusion 513
A special THANK YOU to my editors. You make me appear smarter than I am. This book would be a mess without your input and 
guidance. I owe you all more credit than I can possibly give within this closing thought.
I am often asked my opinion about the future of OSINT. In short, YOU are the future, not artificial intelligence 
or online services. Occasionally, I am asked to advise intelligence collection companies during the creation of a 
new "all-in-one" OSINT solution. I decline these requests because the easy solutions are usually7 short-lived. 
Constant changes in technology7, and automated data collection restrictions, make these commercial products 
less powerful over time. I do not believe these can ever replace your analytical brain. The truly valuable and 
powerful OSINT techniques are going to require manual work from an individual investigator. Your OSINT 
analysis skills cannot be replaced by7 a machine. Please go do good things with these methods, and never allow 
a program to become more beneficial than you.
