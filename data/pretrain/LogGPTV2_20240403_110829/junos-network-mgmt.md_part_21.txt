### Test ID Configuration and ETH-SLM Accuracy
The test ID is configured at the initiating Maintenance End Point (MEP) and is used by the responding MEP to identify the test. Since ETH-SLM (Ethernet Synthetic Loss Measurement) is a sampling technique, it is less precise than counting service frames directly. The accuracy of the measurement depends on the number of SLM frames used or the period for transmitting these frames.

### Reception of SLMs and Transmission of SLRs
Upon receiving a valid SLM frame from the source MEP, the destination MEP generates and transmits an SLR (Synthetic Loss Response) frame back to the requesting or source MEP. The SLR frame is considered valid if the MEG (Maintenance Entity Group) level and the destination MAC address match the receiving MEP’s MAC address. All fields in the SLM PDU are copied to the SLR PDU, with the following exceptions:
- The source MAC address is moved to the destination MAC address, and the source address is set to the MEP’s MAC address.
- The OpCode field value is changed from SLM to SLR (54).
- The responder MEP ID is populated with the MEP’s MEP ID.
- The TxFCb (Transmit Frame Count Backward) is updated with the local counter RxFCl (Receive Frame Count Local) value at the time of SLR transmission.

An SLR frame is generated each time an SLM frame is received, making RxFCl equal to the number of SLM frames received and also equal to the number of SLR frames sent. At the responder or receiving MEP, RxFCl equals TxFCl (Transmit Frame Count Local).

### Reception of SLRs
After transmitting an SLM frame with a given TxFCf (Transmit Frame Count Forward) value, the MEP expects to receive a corresponding SLR frame carrying the same TxTCf value within a timeout period (5 seconds). SLR frames received after this timeout are discarded. Using the information in the SLR frames, the MEP calculates the frame loss for the specified measurement period. This period is a time interval during which the number of SLM frames transmitted is statistically adequate for a given accuracy.

A MEP uses the following values to determine near-end and far-end frame loss during the measurement period:
- **Last received SLR frame's** TxFCf and TxFCb values and the local counter RxFCl value at the end of the measurement period, represented as TxFCf[tc], TxFCb[tc], and RxFCl[tc], where `tc` is the end time of the measurement period.
- **First received SLR frame's** TxFCf and TxFCb values and the local counter RxFCl at the beginning of the measurement period, represented as TxFCf[tp], TxFCb[tp], and RxFCl[tp], where `tp` is the start time of the measurement period.

For each SLR packet received, the local RxFCl counter is incremented at the sending or source MEP.

### Computation of Frame Loss
Frame loss is calculated at the end of the measurement period using the local counters and the last received frame's TxFCf and TxFCb values. The formulae for calculating frame loss are:
- **Far-end frame loss**: `TxFCf – TxFCb`
- **Near-end frame loss**: `TxFCb – RxFCl`

### Release History
#### Junos OS Release 16.1
- **Inaccurate ETH-LM Results**: When CFM (Connectivity Fault Management) and PM (Performance Monitoring) PDUs received locally at a MEP are classified as belonging to the yellow class or have a PLP (Packet Loss Priority) of medium-high, the Ethernet loss measurement (ETH-LM) results are inaccurate.
- **Unsupported Performance Monitoring**: Performance monitoring for CFM, when including the `performance-monitoring` statement and its substatements at the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]` hierarchy level, is not supported when the NNI (Network-to-Network Interface) or egress interface is an aggregated Ethernet interface with member links on DPCs (Distributed Port Concentrators).

### Configuring Ethernet Frame Delay Measurement Sessions
This section provides guidelines for configuring and managing Ethernet frame delay measurement (ETH-DM) sessions, including one-way and two-way measurements, and viewing delay statistics and frame counts.

#### Guidelines for Configuring Routers to Support an ETH-DM Session
- **Configuration Requirements for ETH-DM**:
  - Measurements can be performed between peer MEPs on two routers.
  - Both MEPs must be configured on two Ethernet physical or logical interfaces under the same MA (Maintenance Association) identifier.
  - Both routers must associate the MA with the same MD (Maintenance Domain) name.
  - PPM (Periodic Packet Management) must be running on both the Routing Engine and Packet Forwarding Engine, which is the default configuration. Disabling PPM on the Packet Forwarding Engine requires re-enabling distributed PPM.
- **Configuration Options for ETH-DM**:
  - By default, ETH-DM uses software-based timestamping. Optionally, hardware-assisted timestamping can be enabled for increased accuracy under heavy traffic conditions.

#### Guidelines for Starting an ETH-DM Session
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Configure two MX Series routers with CFM-enabled physical or logical Ethernet interfaces.
  - Create and configure CFM maintenance domains, maintenance associations, and maintenance association end points.
- **Parameters**:
  - Specify the type of ETH-DM measurement (one-way or two-way).
  - Define the Ethernet service, MD, MA, and remote MEP.
  - Optional: specify the number of ETH-DM requests and the frame interval.

#### Restrictions for an ETH-DM Session
- No multiple simultaneous ETH-DM sessions with the same remote MEP or MAC address.
- Maximum of 65,535 frames per session.
- The ETH-DM database stores up to 100 statistics per CFM session, with older statistics being aged out.
- GRES (Graceful Routing Engine Switchover) causes loss of collected ETH-DM statistics and resets frame counts.
- Perform ETH-DM on a stable system for accurate data.

#### Managing ETH-DM Statistics and Frame Counts
- **ETH-DM Statistics**:
  - One-way: Collected at the receiver MEP.
  - Two-way: Collected at the initiator MEP.
  - Use `show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management` commands to view statistics.
- **ETH-DM Frame Counts**:
  - Stored in the CFM database.
  - Use `show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management` commands to view frame counts.

#### Configuring Routers to Support an ETH-DM Session
- **Configuring MEP Interfaces**:
  - Configure two physical or logical Ethernet interfaces connected by a VLAN.
  - Attach peer MEPs to the interfaces.
- **Ensuring Distributed PPM is Not Disabled**:
  - Re-enable PPM if disabled on the Packet Forwarding Engine.
- **Enabling Hardware-Assisted Timestamping**:
  - Optional for increased accuracy under heavy traffic.
- **Configuring Server-Side Processing**:
  - Additional configurations may be required based on specific requirements.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively configure and manage Ethernet frame delay measurement sessions to ensure accurate and reliable performance monitoring.
