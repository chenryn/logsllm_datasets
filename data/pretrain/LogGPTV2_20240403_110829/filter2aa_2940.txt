Online Corporate Intel most 
effective when...
It is automated
Data can be parsed and stored in a database
Stores data over a period of time
Creates context by combining various data from a 
variety of sources
Uses statistical analysis to make          
recomendations
Allows user to configure
Creating relevance
Cross reference multiple sources
Gathter information periodically over time
Trend analysis

– What's a good buy?
– What's a good selling price?
Whois servers
News servers
HTTP headers
Mail
Technology 
(the basics of collecting and 
using intelligence in three steps)
Identify sources, write bots and 
store data
Write a data-driven web site 
for the customer of the data
Create a scheduler for the 
webbots and spiders
Simple examples 
CopCorporate Intelligence 
“Dashboards”
Provide “big picture” of data within some 
defined context
Adds context to data
Filters
Statistics
Show trends
Creates branding opportunities

(Are people stealing from you?)
Policing the Intenet
Problem:
People steal things and want to liquidate 
them quickly.
Online auctions are an attractive 
alternative to pawn shops.
Policing the Internet   
(continued)
Solution:
Create an online interface that allows law 
enforcement to enter groups of items 
stolen at the same time and place.
Write webbots that looks for 
individuals selling similar 
groupings from similar places
on 
online auctions.

Interactive Intelligence
Sniping agents:
Software that places last-second bids on 
online auctions.
Prevents the bidding process from raising 
the auction prices.
Somewhat limited by proxy            
bidding
Interactive Intelligence
Intelligent shopping software:
Webbots collect market information on 
select items.
When an items meet criteria (determined 
by collected market intelligence) those 
items are either automatically      
purchased or reccomended for     
purchase.
Stocks, online auctions, etc.
Online Sources
Respect their bandwidth
Be as stealthy as you can
Tips on writing stealthy 
bots and spiders
Treat bandwidth with respect
(But don't forget to download both HTML & images)
Introduce randomness
Change your start times
Randomize time periods between downloads
Randomize sequence of page downloads
Rotate IP addresses
Use a “link proxy:
