the number of ID-sharing domains across various proﬁle sizes (browsing histories)
and proﬁle conditions (logged-in, logged-out, and noAcount). Table 6 shows the
unique number of ID-sharing domains per proﬁle size and condition. The results
in Table 6 suggests that users with a larger proﬁle (more browsing history) are
tracked by a higher number of ID-sharing domains than those with smaller proﬁle
sizes. On the other hand, we ﬁnd the number of ID-sharing domains, unexpect-
edly, higher in the logged-out condition than logged-in (Table 6b). In general, the
comparable numbers of ID-sharing domains across various proﬁle conditions and
proﬁle sizes suggest that the users are being tracked regardless of their proﬁle
condition and the amount of browsing history (Table 6).
Afterwards, we examined the presence of organisational ID-sharing groups
across diﬀerent proﬁle conditions. We deﬁned ID-sharing groups as sets of
domains that share user-speciﬁc IDs (refer to Sect. 2.2). In addition, we identiﬁed

the organisations behind the sharing groups using the method described in the
Sect. 2.2. We identiﬁed 694 ID-sharing groups of which 357 (=51 %) belonging to
two distinct organisations. We ﬁnd that across these groups, Google and Rubi-
con Project have the highest presence with respectively 27 (=7 %), 20 (=5 %)
cases. Figure 4 shows the number of organisational ID-sharing groups against
their group size when the user is logged-out (Fig. 4a) and logged-in (Fig. 4b).
The number of ID-sharing groups with a larger size are higher in the logged-out
condition comparing to the logged-in condition. As an example, Fig. 5 shows the
largest ID-sharing group for the logged-out mode. In this group, we ﬁnd the
Rubicon Project, Switch Concept (an ad. Network company) and StickyADStv
(a video publisher company) as the most dominant ones in terms of organisa-
tional ID-sharing. We observe strong collaborations between speciﬁc organisa-
tions such as the Rubicon Project, Sovrn (an ad Network company), Google and
StickyADStv.
This unexpected ﬁnding can be due to the fact that more domains have been
collaborating with each other when the user was logged-out, to compensate for
the lack of context about the user, and trying to create a more precise proﬁle
for that user—by gathering as much information as possible.

colored organisations are involved in higher number of cross-organisational ID-sharing.
In [9], they examined the access of web trackers to personal information based
on the category of the ﬁrst-party website in which they are embedded. They
found that websites providing health and travel-related services disclose more
information to trackers than other types of websites. Gill et al. [10] studied the
amount of inferred information about users through tracking their visited web-
sites by ad networks. Liu et al. [11] have looked at tracking personal data on
the web using ISP travel from 2011, however the big shift away from using clear
text in the web introduces a much more complicated user ID sharing ecosystem
in the web today. They observed that ad networks are able to estimate users’
interest with 50 % accuracy. These studies showed the possible access of track-
ers to the user personal information whereas we study the scale and nature of
tracking ecosystem.
Roesner et al. [12] proposed a framework for classifying the behaviour of web
trackers based on the scope of the browsing proﬁle they produce. They show
the spread of the identiﬁed classes amongst the top 500 websites in the world.
Zarras et al. [13] studied the ecosystem of ad networks that serve malicious
advertisement. Interestingly, they observed some ad networks which more than a
third of their traﬃc belongs to malicious advertisement. Gomer et al. [14] focused
on the network aspects of third-party trackers which appeared in the search
results of three search engines. They show a consistent network structure of
40
M. Falahrastegar et al.
third-party trackers and high eﬃciency in exchanging information among third-
parties.
Mayer et al. [15] surveyed diﬀerent techniques which are used by web trackers
to collect user information. Acar et al. [6] presented a thorough study of persis-
tent user tracking mechanisms, particularly canvas ﬁngerprinting and evercook-
ies. They introduced a method for identifying persistent user IDs. They crawled
top 3,000 Alexa domains, and examined the eﬀect of blocking third-party cook-
ies as well as advertisement opt-out. They observed a decrease in the number of
shared IDs, however, they showed that such decrease does not aﬀect the overall
access of ID sharing domains to user’s browsing history. The main purpose of
this study is to explore persistent methods of user tracking through active mea-
surements. Additionally, Olejnik et al. [7] studied cookie syncing. They observed
the presence of over 100 cookie syncing across top 100 sites. While these studies
highlighted the presence of ID-sharing practice across the Web, we focus on the
nature of ID sharing groups and their relation with user information using a
series of active and passive measurements.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we explored the entangled connections between all parties of the
Web ecosystem. In particular, we investigated the tracking groups that shared
user speciﬁc identiﬁers. We recorded the browsing history of more than 100 users
for more than two weeks. To our surprise, we ﬁnd 660 ID-sharing groups in our
data. We identify a signiﬁcant amount of ID-sharing across diﬀerent organisa-
tions. We identiﬁed Google and Rubicon Project (an ad. network company) as
the most dominant companies that used ID-sharing. Similar to our observation
at the organisational level, we observe a signiﬁcant presence of domains from
diﬀerent categories within ID-sharing groups. We observe that sensitive domain
categories such as health related ones participate in the ID-sharing with domains
related to advertisement trackers and search engines (seven ID-sharing groups).
Moreover, we examined the eﬀect of user proﬁle on the presence of ID-sharing
domains. Interestingly, we observe that users are being tracked regardless of their
proﬁle condition (logged-in or logged-out) and the amount of browsing history.
We unexpectedly observe that the number of ID-sharing domains are higher in
the logged-out condition than logged-in. Our results suggest that more domains
are collaborating with each other when the user is logged-out trying to create a
more precise proﬁle for that user. As a further work, we would like to examine
whether this collaboration amongst ID-sharing domains in the logged-out mode
aims to identify the user, or it is a side-eﬀect of knowing less about the user, hence
being more inclusive in potential advertising sources. Note that from our data we
cannot directly observe whether domains use these IDs to merge collected data
from diﬀerent sources. However, considering the possibility of such practice, we
believe it is important to get additional insight about what ID-sharing groups
actually do through the user IDs.
