# ID-Sharing Domains Across Iterations

The figures below illustrate the number of ID-sharing domains across various iterations, with each bar representing an iteration. The data is categorized based on profile sizes (browsing histories) and profile conditions (logged-in, logged-out, and no account).

## Analysis of ID-Sharing Domains

Table 6 presents the unique number of ID-sharing domains per profile size and condition. The results suggest that users with larger profiles (more browsing history) are tracked by a higher number of ID-sharing domains compared to those with smaller profiles. Surprisingly, the number of ID-sharing domains is higher in the logged-out condition than in the logged-in condition (see Table 6b). This indicates that users are being tracked regardless of their profile condition and the amount of browsing history.

### Table 6: Total Number of Unique ID-Sharing Domains
#### (a) Profile Size
| Profile Size | Unique ID-Sharing Domains |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 500          | 32                        |
| 200          | 37                        |
| 100          | 42                        |
| 50           | 47                        |
| 20           | 17                        |
| 10           | 12                        |
| 5            | 27                        |

#### (b) Profile Condition
| Profile Condition | Unique ID-Sharing Domains |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Logged-out        | 22                        |
| Logged-in         | 32                        |
| No Account        | 37                        |

## Organizational ID-Sharing Groups

We also examined the presence of organizational ID-sharing groups across different profile conditions. We defined ID-sharing groups as sets of domains that share user-specific IDs (refer to Section 2.2). We identified 694 ID-sharing groups, with 357 (51%) belonging to two distinct organizations. Google and Rubicon Project have the highest presence, with 27 (7%) and 20 (5%) cases, respectively.

### Figure 4: Organizational ID-Sharing Groups
- **(a) Logged-out**
- **(b) Logged-in**

The Y-axis in both figures uses a logarithmic scale. The number of ID-sharing groups with larger sizes is higher in the logged-out condition compared to the logged-in condition. For example, the largest ID-sharing group in the logged-out mode includes Rubicon Project, Switch Concept (an ad network company), and StickyADStv (a video publisher company) as the most dominant ones in terms of organizational ID-sharing. We observe strong collaborations between specific organizations such as Rubicon Project, Sovrn (an ad network company), Google, and StickyADStv.

This unexpected finding can be attributed to the fact that more domains collaborate with each other when the user is logged out, to compensate for the lack of context about the user and to create a more precise profile by gathering as much information as possible.

## Related Work

Several studies have analyzed trackers from different perspectives. Krishnamurthy & Wills [2] showed the expansion of third-party trackers and the acquisitions of tracking companies from 2005 over a three-year period. In [9], they examined the access of web trackers to personal information based on the category of the first-party website in which they are embedded. They found that websites providing health and travel-related services disclose more information to trackers than other types of websites. Gill et al. [10] studied the amount of inferred information about users through tracking their visited websites by ad networks. Liu et al. [11] looked at tracking personal data on the web using ISP traffic from 2011, but the shift away from using clear text has introduced a more complex user ID sharing ecosystem today. These studies highlighted the possible access of trackers to user personal information, while our study focuses on the scale and nature of the tracking ecosystem.

Roesner et al. [12] proposed a framework for classifying the behavior of web trackers based on the scope of the browsing profile they produce. Zarras et al. [13] studied the ecosystem of ad networks that serve malicious advertisements and observed that some ad networks have more than a third of their traffic belonging to malicious advertisements. Gomer et al. [14] focused on the network aspects of third-party trackers appearing in search results from three search engines, showing a consistent network structure and high efficiency in exchanging information among third-parties.

Mayer et al. [15] surveyed different techniques used by web trackers to collect user information. Acar et al. [6] presented a thorough study of persistent user tracking mechanisms, particularly canvas fingerprinting and evercookies, and introduced a method for identifying persistent user IDs. They crawled the top 3,000 Alexa domains and examined the effect of blocking third-party cookies and advertisement opt-out. While these studies highlighted the presence of ID-sharing practices across the Web, we focus on the nature of ID-sharing groups and their relation with user information using a series of active and passive measurements.

## Conclusion

In this paper, we explored the entangled connections between all parties in the Web ecosystem, particularly investigating the tracking groups that shared user-specific identifiers. We recorded the browsing history of more than 100 users for more than two weeks and found 660 ID-sharing groups in our data. We identified a significant amount of ID-sharing across different organizations, with Google and Rubicon Project (an ad network company) being the most dominant. Similar to our observations at the organizational level, we observed a significant presence of domains from different categories within ID-sharing groups. Sensitive domain categories, such as health-related ones, participate in ID-sharing with domains related to advertisement trackers and search engines.

We also examined the effect of user profile on the presence of ID-sharing domains and found that users are being tracked regardless of their profile condition (logged-in or logged-out) and the amount of browsing history. Interestingly, the number of ID-sharing domains is higher in the logged-out condition than in the logged-in condition. Our results suggest that more domains collaborate with each other when the user is logged out, trying to create a more precise profile for that user. As future work, we would like to examine whether this collaboration among ID-sharing domains in the logged-out mode aims to identify the user or is a side-effect of knowing less about the user, leading to more inclusive potential advertising sources. 

Note that from our data, we cannot directly observe whether domains use these IDs to merge collected data from different sources. However, considering the possibility of such practice, it is important to gain additional insight into what ID-sharing groups actually do through the user IDs.
