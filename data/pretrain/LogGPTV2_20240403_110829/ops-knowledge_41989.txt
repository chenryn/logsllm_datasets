User: How to set up Nginx reverse proxy to realize HTTPS protocol access?
Assistant: To set up Nginx reverse proxy and implement HTTPS protocol access, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx First, you need to install Nginx on the server. 2. Generate an SSL certificate You can use Let's Encrypt or other certificate authority to generate a certificate. 3. Configure Nginx Add the following content to the Nginx configuration file: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } server { listen 443 ssl; server_name example.com; ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/certificate_key; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } ``` This configuration file redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS, and proxy HTTPS requests to local port 3000, which can be modified according to actual needs. 4. Restart Nginx After the configuration is complete, you need to restart Nginx to make it take effect. After completing the above steps, you can access it through the HTTPS protocol.
