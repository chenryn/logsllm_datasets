## Bug Report

### Summary
We have been working smoothly with version 7.12.17, but after updating to 7.13.5, we encountered an error stating that `regeneratorRuntime` is not defined. According to the release notes, there are no breaking changes in 7.13.5, and this is the only change we made.

### Current Behavior
- **Before Update (7.12.17):** No issues were observed.
- **After Update (7.13.5):** The application fails with the error: `regeneratorRuntime is not defined`.
