It appears there's no way to apply hidden-xs (or other of the hidden classes)
to inline elements. In my particular case, I'd like helper text to appear to
the right of my horizontal form fields -- but not on smartphones where form
fields use 100% width.
I suggest adding a span.hidden-xs style (simlarly to the existing td.hidden-xs
style), so using the span tag will allow for inline hidden elements when
necessary. This would be an easy fix, adding only a small bit of CSS, and
rather intuitive.
Note that the span.hidden-xs style cannot be added outside of the bootstrap
CSS file, since it will not apply in the proper order. So my workaround was to
create a new hidden-xs-inline class for my use.
