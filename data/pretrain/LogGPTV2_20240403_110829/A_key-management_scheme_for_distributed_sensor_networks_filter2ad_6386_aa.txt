ECG-IJS Key Agreement and Authentication in
Wireless Body Sensor Networks
Zhaoyang Zhang and Honggang Wang, Athanasios V. Vasilakos, Hua Fang
Abstract—Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) have
drawn much attention from research community and industry in
recent years. Multimedia healthcare services provided by WBSNs
can be available to anyone, anywhere and anytime seamlessly. A
critical issue in WBSNs is how to preserve the integrity and
privacy of a person’s medical data over wireless environments
in a resource efﬁcient manner. This paper presents a novel key
agreement scheme which allows neighboring nodes in WBSNs
to share a common key generated by electrocardiogram (ECG)
signals. The Improved Jules Sudan (IJS) algorithm is proposed
to set up the key agreement for the message authentication. The
proposed ECG-IJS key agreement can secure data communi-
cations over WBSNs in a plug-n-play manner without any key
distribution overheads. Both the simulation and experimental
results are presented, which demonstrate that the proposed ECG-
IJS scheme can achieve better security performance in terms of
serval performance metrics such as False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
and False Rejection Rate (FRR) than other existing approaches.
In addition, the power consumption analysis also shows that
the proposed ECG-IJS scheme can achieve energy efﬁciency for
WBSNs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) can be deployed
on a person’s body for pervasive and real-time healthcare
monitoring in the form of multimedia such as text, audio,
image and video. The non-intrusive and ambulatory health
monitoring of patients’ vital signs over WBSNs provides an
economical solution to the current healthcare system, in which
the healthcare information can be distributed to users anytime
through handheld devices and internet. A WBSNs consists of
a set of mobile and small size intercommunicating sensors,
which are either wearable or can be implanted into the human
body for monitoring vital signs (e.g., heart rate, brain activity,
blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and/or environmental
parameters (e.g., location, temperature, humidity and light) and
movements. However, there are several research challenges
before WBSNs can be widely deployed. Firstly, the sensors
has limited resources in terms of energy, bandwidth, memory
and computational capability, a lightweight communication
solution should be pursued in WBSNs. Secondly, since the

performance of WBSNs are closely related to people’s health,
it is important to have safe sensor networks in which the
requirements of medical data privacy, conﬁdentiality, authen-
tication and integrity should be satisﬁed. The lack of security
in the operation and communication of resource-constrained
medical sensor nodes in WBSNs has been an obstacle to move
the technology forward.
A. Cryptography and authentication for secure multimedia
healthcare services
Cryptography and authentication methods are utilized in
WBSNs to offer secure multimedia healthcare services via
wireless communications. In WBSNs, sensors usually rely on
the cryptographic keys to secure multimedia data communi-
cations. Numerous key management and distribution schemes
have been developed to offer the security in general wireless
sensor networks. However, they can not be directly applied for
the WBSNs due to the scale of biomedical sensors. However,
designing an efﬁcient key management and agreement scheme
in WBSNs is still challenging. The key distribution methods,
such as probabilistic key distribution [1], SPINS [2], LEAP
[3], and asymmetric crypto-systems [4] have been developed
to distribute security keys in WBSNs. But
these methods
are not easily implemented in body sensors due to limited
sensor resources, or requiring pre-deployment of the secret
keys which are hard to be replaced and are vulnerable to ofﬂine
crack. In addition, the overheads of the key management and
distributions in these methods are huge when large number of
sensor nodes are deployed [5] [6].
In this paper, we present a new key agreement scheme
called ECG-IJS, which utilizes physiological signal such as
ECG signals for generating cryptographic keys. Using ECG-
IJS scheme, the secure inter-sensor communication could be
implemented in a “plug and play” manner, which means that
no previous key distribution is needed. The secret keys used in
the communication are generated based on the ECG signals,
which meets the the requirements of long, random,
time
variant keys proposed in [7]. The proposed key is generated
from a universally measurable physiological stimuli (ECG)
that is unique and distinctive for each person. Additionally,
the ECG-IJS scheme only needs a small
time period to
generate keys with low computational requirements. The ECG-
IJS scheme can also achieve better performance in term of
FAR and FRR than the existing research work in [8]. In
addition, it is an energy efﬁcient scheme because it does not
require the Chaff points (communication overheads) used in
[8]. A power consumption analysis is given to demonstrate the
energy efﬁciency of the proposed ECG-IJS scheme.

B. Major Contributions
We summarized our major contributions in this paper.
Firstly, we innovated a new biometric-based approach to
authenticate the message through a lightweight manner in
WBSNs, which is a piratical solution and can be simply
implemented in the resource constrained biomedical sensors;
(2) A novel key-agreement scheme is developed to allow
communication parties to share the same key without much
overheads; (3) a framework for the security and energy efﬁ-
ciency analysis of WBSNs is given to evaluate the efﬁciency
of the proposed approach. Our research opens a new vista of
securing medical data transmission over WBSNs.
II. RELATED WORKS
A typical topology of WBSNs shown in Figure 1 includes
multiple types of medical sensors that can be wirelessly
connected to other medical sensors or to the control nodes
(e.g., Smartphones), which could interface with other types
of networks such as WiMAX or WiFI to further deliver
the collected medical information to the information center.
Many great efforts have been devoted to developing secure
communication schemes between the internet and control
nodes. Thus, our studies focus on the securing inter-sensor
communication over the body area instead. A comprehensive
survey on wireless body area networks is given in [9].
Fig. 1. Body Sensor Networks
Besides the transitional key distribution schemes,
there
are several on-going research works that implement the key
distribution using biometric features. The research in [10] [11]
[7] [12] utilize the physiological signals for securing intersen-
sor communication over WBSNs. The authors in [10] [11]
proposed the use of the frequency coefﬁcients of the ECG or
Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to generate cryptographic
keys. In [7] [12], the Inter-Pulse-Interval (IPI) derived from
ECG/PPG signals is proposed to generate cryptographic keys.
The Fuzzy Vault method proposed by Jules and Sudan
in [13] has been used in the message authentication with
biometric information as shown in [14] [15] [16]. In [8].
The authors ﬁrstly proposed to use the Fuzzy Vault method
called PSKA to secure inter-sensor communications. Then,
2
some modiﬁed Fuzzy Vault scheme [17] [18] were proposed
to use the ECG signals to improve security performance. The
authors in [19] give a Improved Jules and Sudan scheme,which
has been proved with high performance in the applications of
the ﬁngerprint-based key generation [20]. The PSKA scheme
proposed in [8] uses Fuzzy Vault
to lock the randomly
generated key in the vault at the sender, and unlock the vault
to regenerate the key by the similar features available at the
receiver. However, the security of the vault depend on its size,
so extra Chaff points are needed to ensure the security of
the vault, which brings the extra communication overheads.
The authors of paper [21] suggest the use of ECG signals as
a biometric feature to authenticate users and messages. The
approach requires the creation of an ECG template and then
comparing their current ECG signals with this template to
verify the identity. However, it is not efﬁcient to achieve good
security performance due to using the static template. In our
proposed ECG-IJS, we extract the time-variant features from
the ECG signals and use them as keys to encrypt/authenticate
messages.
III. SYSTEM MODELS
A. A Fuzzy Vault Scheme
A Fuzzy Vault scheme was proposed by Juels and Sudan
[13]. The Fuzzy Vault scheme is designed to lock (hide) a
secret (S) in a construct called a Vault using a set of values A.
The procedure of construct a Vault is as follows: (1) generating
a vth-order polynomial p over the variable x that encodes the
secret S; (2) computing the value of the polynomial at different
values of x from set A and creating a set R = fai; p(ai)g;
(3) Adding randomly generated set of points C = ci; cj called
Chaff to R. Once the vault has been constructed, only the
values B similar to set A could unlock the vault and discover
the secret S. The unlock procedure is an inverse process: (1)
ﬁnding points (xi; yi) from R according to the element in B;
(2) Reconstructing the vth-order polynomial by the acquired
points above; (3) Decoding the coefﬁcients of the polynomial
using a Reed-Solomon Decoder. If the ﬁnal decoding operation
′ should be equal to
is successful, then the output secret k
k if the set B is close to the original set A. Otherwise,
the reconstruction process of the secret key fails. The PSKA
method [8] uses the Fuzzy Vault in WBSNs as a key agreement
protocol. The key agreement process of PSKA using Fuzzy
Vault scheme are shown in Figure 2, which contains both vault
construction and re-construction processes.
B. The Improved Fuzzy Vault scheme
Based on Juels and Sudan’s work, Y. Dodis et al. proposed
an Improved Fuzzy Vault algorithm called Improved Juels and
Sudan algorithm (IJS) [19]. In IJS algorithm, the sender can
construct a unique monic polynomial using the F as the roots
and send parts of the coefﬁcients to the receiver. Without
knowing most of the roots, it is impossible for the receiver
to reconstruct the monic polynomial to discover K. When
the receiver receives the coefﬁcients sent by the sender, it
can reconstruct the polynomial by F
it has. The receiver
the monic polynomial only
could successfully reconstruct

f (x) can be written as fh(x) + q(x), where q(x) has degree
s(cid:0) t(cid:0) 1. The recovery algorithm will have the coefﬁcients of
fh as the input. For any point x in w, 0 = f (x) = fh(x) +
q(x) is satisﬁed. Thus, fh(x) and (cid:0)q(x) agree at all points
′ in at least s (cid:0) t=2 points,
in w. Since set w intersects w
the polynomial (cid:0)q(x) satisﬁes the conditions. In addition, the
polynomial is unique, since no two distinct polynomials of
degree s (cid:0) t(cid:0) 1 can have the correct bi on more than s (cid:0) t=2
ai. Thus, the recovered polynomial fl(x) should be (cid:0)q(x).
Then fh(x) (cid:0) fl(x) = f (x) is satisﬁed.
Consider the following example that illustrates the process
of the IJS. Suppose s = 5 and t = 2, let the sender and the re-
ceiver have the set w = f1; 2; 3; 4; 5g and w
= f1; 3; 5; 7; 9g,

f (x) =
then it send 2 coefﬁcients f(cid:0)15; 85g to the receiver. After
receiving the 4 coefﬁcients, the receiver constructs a poly-
nomial fh = x5 (cid:0) 15x4 + 85x3, and then evaluates all the
elements in the set ui 2 w
′ by vi = fh(ui) to form a set
of pairs f(1; 71); (3; 1323); (5; 4375); (7; 9947); (9; 22599)g.
Reed-Solomon decoding is used to search a polynomial fl
with degree 2 such that vi = pl(ui) for at
least 4 of
ui values. After the searching process,
the receiver gets
fl(x) = 225x2 (cid:0) 274 + 120. Thus, the receiver reconstructs
the f (x) = fh(x)(cid:0) fl(x). And then it could recover the w by
solving the roots of the monic polynomial f (x).
∏
Compared with the original Fuzzy Vault Scheme, the IJS
algorithm does not use the Chaff points to secure the in-
formation. Thus it reduces the transmission overheads, saves
the transmission energy and prolongs the lifetime of the
battery. Most of nodes in WBSNs are battery-supported, the
availability and reliability of the networks increases if less
energy is consumed. In this paper, a scheme called ECG-IJS
key agreement that uses the ECG signals and IJS scheme is
proposed to implement the key agreement protocol in WBSNs.
C. Proposed ECG-IJS Scheme
Based on the IJS algorithm described above, we propose
an ECG-IJS key agreement to secure data communication
in WBSNs. Especially, our approach focuses on the inter
communication and authentication between the sensor nodes
in the WBSNs. The proposed ECG-IJS scheme is shown in
Figure 3. In the scheme, we assume that both the sender and
the receiver have the capability to sample the ECG signals
from the human body. Thus, the same feature extraction algo-
