Real-world & cybercrime
Current approaches 
evolved to deal with 
real-world crime
Cybercrime occurs in
a different context 
and therefore 
presents different 
issues
Example #1:  Theft
Real-world theft:  possession of 
property shifts completely from A 
to B, i.e., A had it now B has it
Cyber-theft:  Property 
is copied, so A “has” 
it and so does B
Copying as theft?
Randall Schwartz 
worked for Intel
Charged with computer 
theft for copying a 
password file
Claimed it wasn’t theft 
because Intel did not 
“lose” anything – Intel 
still had the passwords, 
and so did Schwartz
Example #2:  Seizure
Is copying files a 
seizure under the 
Fourth Amendment
Same as theft?
Nicky Scarfo logger
Nicky Scarfo logger
FBI executed warrant at 
Scarfo’s office
Seized files from his 
computer – one was 
encrypted
Agents installed a 
keystroke logger on his 
office PC, copied his 
passphrase – seizure?
What is cybercrime?
Cybercrimes are divided into 
3 categories:  
crimes where a computer 
is the target of the crime, 
crimes where a computer 
is a tool of the crime, and 
crimes where a computer 
is incidental to the 
commission of the crime.
Computer as Target
Hacking (trespass)
Cracking (burglary)
Malicious code 
(viruses, worms, 
Trojan horses)
Vandalism (web 
site defacement)
Denial of service 
attacks
Target case:  John Sullivan
Hired to develop software 
program for Lance, Inc.
Demoted, he hid a logic 
bomb in the program
It shut down 824 handheld 
computers sales reps 
used to contact 
headquarters, costing 
Lance, Inc. over $100,000
U.S. v. Sullivan, 40 Fed. 
Appx. 740 (4th Cir. 2002)
Target Case: Czubinski
IRS customer service rep 
who could use IRS 
computers to answer 
customer questions
Looked up tax returns of 
a woman he dated, ADA 
prosecuting his father, 
etc.
Charged with wire and 
computer fraud
Charges dismissed – no 
evidence of scheme to 
defraud
Denial of Service - 02/2000
Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, 
CNN & Buy.com were 
all attacked
15-year-old pled guilty 
to the attacks, which 
did an estimated $1.7 
billion in damage
8 months in a juvenile 
detention center
DDos Attack on GRC.Com
“I just ddosed you,”  Wicked, 13
Computer As Tool
Fraud
Theft
Extortion
Stalking
Forgery
Child 
pornography
Other???
Theft:  Citibank
Vladimir Levin took 
responsibility for 
siphoning $10 million 
from Citibank and 
transferring it into 
foreign accounts
Sentenced to 3 years 
in prison
Identity Theft/Fraud
Abraham Abdallah, a 
bus boy, stole the 
identifies of Oprah 
Winfrey, George 
Lucas, Ross Perot, 
etc.
Transferred funds 
from their accounts 
to ones he set up 
using computers in 
public libraries
Fake Escrow Sites
Dentist Bruce Lachot sent $55,000 to 
an escrow site to buy a BMW from a 
German seller
Fake site 
Lachot never 
got his BMW 
or his money 
back
Fraud?  Theft?
Hacker fixes online 
casino’s server so 
people playing craps 
and slots could not 
lose
Players won $1.9 
million
Others have done 
similar things, then 
demanded money not 
to repeat it
Stalking a School
1999 – Massachusetts 
middle school is stalked 
by an unknown person
Students, faculty, 
parents and the entire 
town are panicked
Christian Hunold, a 20 
year old paraplegic,  
eventually identified as 
the stalker

Computer Incidental
Blackmailer uses 
computer to write 
blackmail letters
Drug dealer 
stores records on 
computer
Computer used to 
research murder 
methods 
Divergences
Real-world crime and 
cybercrime differ in 
several respects
Differences make it 
difficult to apply 
traditional principles 
of criminal law and law 
enforcement to 
cybercrime  
Real-world crime
Proximity 
Limited Scale
Physical 
constraints
Patterns
Real-world crime shaped law 
enforcement 
Reactive model
Crime committed
Investigation
Apprehension
Conviction
Deterrence
Crime controlled 
Cybercrime:  proximity
“In the networked world, no island is an 
island.”
McConnell International, Cyber Crime . . . And Punishment Archaic Laws 
Threaten Global Information (2001).
Proximity: example #1
Onel de Guzman, accused 
author of the “Love Bug” 
virus
$10-$12 billion in damage 
in over 20 countries
Not a crime in the 
Philippines, never 
prosecuted, anywhere
Proximity:  example #2
Attacked companies 
in 10 states
Extorted money by 
threatening to sell 
stolen data/return 
and cause damage
FBI identified Vasiliy 
Gorshkov and Alexey 
Ivanov as the 
hackers
Gorshkov  
Ivanov
Example #2 - continued
Interview with Invita 
Used FBI laptop to access a 
Russian computer and demo 
hacking skills – arrested 
FBI used information obtained 
by a logger on the laptop to 
access the Russian computer 
and download evidence 
without a warrant
Invita: Implications
Cybercrime is transborder, 
transnational crime
Russians would not assist 
FBI -- no MLAT in effect
In August, the Federal 
Security Service charged 
an FBI agent with hacking
Cybercrime:  scale
Thomas & Janice Reedy 
provided a gateway to child 
porn sites
350,000 subscribers (35,000 in 
US & 1,300 in the UK) 
Estimate: it takes 80 hours to 
process one computer, which 
is only part of prosecuting
Physical constraints
Anonymity 
Easier to avoid 
leaving  trace 
evidence
Crimes are 
committed 
quickly – more 
easily concealed
Concealment:  framing
NY executive discovered 
email was being tapped
Traced to former employee, 
Joe Smith, in St. Louis
Smith said he did not do it
Further investigation 
showed Fred Doe, former 
employee in Seattle, tapped 
email and framed Smith 
Cybercrime Patterns?
Lack of accurate 
statistics
No standard offense 
definitions
Hard to parse a 
cybercrime into 
“offenses” – was 
the Love Bug one 
crime or thousands of 
crimes?
Different Approaches
Collaborative model –
commercial
Prevention (information 
sharing, etc.)
Informal reporting of 
cybercrimes
Reacting – private 
resources supplement law 
enforcement resources 
Legal issues
Must private personnel 
abide by rules governing 
law enforcement?
Permissibility of using 
private personnel in 
evidence-gathering
Locus of the decision to 
prosecute
Private Person case
Person claiming to be 
Turkish hacker gives 
police evidence of child 
porn/molestation
Investigation and 
arrests
Turkish hacker agent of 
the police?
U.S. v. Steiger, 318 F.2d 1039 
(11th Cir. 2003) (no); U.S. v. v. 
Jarrett, 229 F. Supp.2d 503 (E.D. 
Va. 2002) (yes_
Shift
Emerging model is a 
shift from a law 
enforcement, primarily 
reactive model, to a 
collaborative preventive-
reactive model 
Emphasizes prevention 
because of the 
difficulties involved in 
reacting to cybercrime
Expanding the Model
Collaborative approach  
for  individuals?
Prevention?  
(Assumption of the risk?)
Increased reporting?
Reacting? Vigilantism?  
Victim reaction?
Institute
University of Dayton School of 
Law establishing new institute
International Institute for 
Technology, Security and Law
Cybercrime research, training, 
policy analysis
