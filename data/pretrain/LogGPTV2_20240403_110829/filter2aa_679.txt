#### Real-World Crime vs. Cybercrime
Current approaches to law enforcement have evolved to address real-world crime. However, cybercrime occurs in a different context, presenting unique challenges and issues.

##### Example #1: Theft
- **Real-World Theft**: The possession of property shifts completely from one individual (A) to another (B). For example, A had the property, and now B has it.
- **Cyber-Theft**: Property is copied, so both A and B "have" it. This raises the question: Is copying considered theft?
  - **Case Study**: Randall Schwartz, an employee at Intel, was charged with computer theft for copying a password file. He argued that it wasn't theft because Intel still had the passwords, and so did he.

##### Example #2: Seizure
- **Fourth Amendment**: Is copying files a seizure under the Fourth Amendment? Is it similar to theft?
  - **Case Study**: Nicky Scarfo's Office
    - The FBI executed a warrant at Scarfo's office and seized files from his computer, including an encrypted file.
    - Agents installed a keystroke logger on his office PC to copy his passphrase. Was this a seizure?

#### What is Cybercrime?
Cybercrimes can be divided into three categories:
1. **Crimes where a computer is the target** (e.g., hacking, cracking, malicious code, vandalism, denial of service attacks).
2 - **Crimes where a computer is a tool** (e.g., fraud, theft, extortion, stalking, forgery, child pornography).
3. **Crimes where a computer is incidental** (e.g., using a computer to write blackmail letters, storing drug records, or researching murder methods).

##### Computer as Target
- **Hacking (Trespass)**: Unauthorized access to a computer system.
- **Cracking (Burglary)**: Breaking into a computer system to commit a crime.
- **Malicious Code (Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses)**: Software designed to cause harm.
- **Vandalism (Website Defacement)**: Altering or damaging a website.
- **Denial of Service Attacks**: Overloading a system to make it unavailable.

**Case Studies**:
- **John Sullivan**: Hired to develop software for Lance, Inc., he hid a logic bomb after being demoted, causing $100,000 in damages.
- **Czubinski**: An IRS customer service representative who looked up tax returns without authorization. Charges were dismissed due to lack of evidence of a scheme to defraud.
- **Denial of Service - 2000**: A 15-year-old attacked Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, CNN, and Buy.com, causing an estimated $1.7 billion in damage. He served 8 months in a juvenile detention center.
- **DDoS Attack on GRC.Com**: A 13-year-old, known as "Wicked," claimed responsibility for the attack.

##### Computer as Tool
- **Fraud**
- **Theft**
- **Extortion**
- **Stalking**
- **Forgery**
- **Child Pornography**

**Case Studies**:
- **Citibank**: Vladimir Levin siphoned $10 million from Citibank and transferred it to foreign accounts. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison.
- **Identity Theft/Fraud**: Abraham Abdallah, a bus boy, stole the identities of celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and George Lucas, transferring funds from their accounts to ones he set up using public library computers.
- **Fake Escrow Sites**: Bruce Lachot, a dentist, lost $55,000 to a fake escrow site while trying to buy a BMW from a German seller.
- **Online Casino Fraud**: A hacker fixed an online casinoâ€™s server, allowing players to win $1.9 million. Similar incidents have led to demands for money not to repeat the hack.
- **Stalking a School**: In 1999, a Massachusetts middle school was stalked by Christian Hunold, a 20-year-old paraplegic.
- **The Nuremberg Files**: A website that tracked abortion providers, using black font for working, grey for wounded, and strikethrough for dead.

##### Computer as Incidental
- **Blackmail**: Using a computer to write blackmail letters.
- **Drug Dealing**: Storing records on a computer.
- **Research**: Using a computer to research murder methods.

#### Divergences Between Real-World and Cybercrime
- **Proximity**: In the networked world, proximity is no longer a limiting factor. For example, Onel de Guzman, the accused author of the "Love Bug" virus, caused $10-$12 billion in damage across 20 countries but was never prosecuted in the Philippines.
- **Scale**: Thomas and Janice Reedy provided a gateway to child porn sites, with 350,000 subscribers. Processing just one computer for prosecution can take 80 hours.
- **Physical Constraints**: Cybercriminals can remain anonymous and avoid leaving trace evidence, making crimes easier to conceal.
- **Patterns**: Lack of accurate statistics and standard offense definitions makes it difficult to parse a cybercrime into specific offenses.

#### Different Approaches
- **Collaborative Model**: Emphasizes prevention through information sharing and informal reporting.
- **Reacting**: Private resources supplement law enforcement, raising legal issues about the permissibility of using private personnel in evidence-gathering and the locus of the decision to prosecute.

**Case Study**:
- **Turkish Hacker Case**: A person claiming to be a Turkish hacker provided evidence of child pornography and molestation, leading to arrests. The legality of using such a person as an agent of the police was questioned.

#### Shift in Law Enforcement
- **Emerging Model**: A shift from a primarily reactive model to a collaborative preventive-reactive model, emphasizing prevention due to the difficulties in reacting to cybercrime.
- **Expanding the Model**: Exploring a collaborative approach for individuals, including prevention, increased reporting, and victim reaction.

#### Institute
- **University of Dayton School of Law**: Establishing the International Institute for Technology, Security, and Law to focus on cybercrime research, training, and policy analysis. Formal announcement in August.
