Encryption technology: Use encryption technology to protect sensitive information, such as SSL, TLS, IPSec, etc. 7. Security audit: Regularly conduct security audits on the network to discover and resolve potential security risks in a timely manner. 8. Employee training: Strengthen employee security awareness training to enhance employees' awareness and coping capabilities of network security. 9. Vulnerability management: regularly scan and repair network devices and software for vulnerabilities to avoid network security problems caused by vulnerabilities. 10. Network monitoring: establish a network monitoring system to monitor network conditions in real time, identify and resolve network security threats in a timely manner.
