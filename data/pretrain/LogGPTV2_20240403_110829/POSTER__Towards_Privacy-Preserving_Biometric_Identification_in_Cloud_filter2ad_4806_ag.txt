diﬃcult, Bhattasali et al. [21]. However, if the data are transmitted to a
remote matcher this mode of attack can be a serious threat to the biometric
system, Peer et al. [163] and Uludag et al. [217]. Moreover, a brute force
30
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
attack is an exhaustive search over the space of biometric inputs in order to
ﬁnd those that match with the user’s biometric data. The channel between
the stored templates and the matcher can be attacked when the biometric
templates are sent to the matcher through a communication channel that
it is subject to interception or modiﬁcation. Finally, the channel between
the matcher and the ﬁnal stage of decision may be attacked through a
manipulation of the match score by capturing or changing the value of the
matcher, or by performing a hill-climbing attack to achieve an optimum
match score before the ﬁnal decision.
• Decision: Overriding the ﬁnal decision can take place by an attacker who
performs manipulation of the decision score at the ﬁnal level of a biometric
veriﬁcation scheme. Even if the actual pattern recognition framework presents
an excellent level of accuracy, it may be rendered useless by this type of
attacks, Li and Jain [122].
3.1.1 Spooﬁng Attacks and Countermeasures
The indirect attacks are performed inside the system and they can be prevented
by ﬁrewalls, anti-virus software, intrusion detection and encryption mechanisms
that are presented in Section 3.3. However, direct attacks at the user interface
level are outside the digital limits of a biometric deployment and therefore, no
digital protection mechanisms can preclude it, Marcel et al. [136]. Spooﬁng at the
level of the stored templates are the most dangerous type of attacks, Podio [166].
Unlike the DB, a sensor can be attacked without advanced programming
techniques, posing serious threats to the security and the privacy of the enrolled
individuals, Cavoukian and Stoianov [47]. A spooﬁng attack occurs when an
impostor tries to masquerade as a valid user by presenting a stolen, replicated or
copied forged biometric feature to the sensor. Systems using face, ﬁngerprint, or
iris patterns (the modalities adopted by ICAO) can be spoofed relatively simply
using, for example, three-dimensional shaped models or falsiﬁcation of facial
characteristics using make-up or plastic surgery, silicon gummy ﬁngerprints and
contact lenses, Chen et al. [50], Hadid et al. [82] and Matsumoto [140]. The
increasing popularity of social media where the photographs of the users are
publicly available presents an advantage to the cheaters who can gain access
to high-resolution photos; this helps them to fool a great variety of the most
robust biometric devices, Pereira et al. [60]. Finally, speech and voice modalities
and soft biometrics including gait and handwriting have been found prone to
spooﬁng attacks, Chingovska et al. [51] and Hadid et al. [83].
Identity theft and fraud are widespread problems with serious consequences
related to the ethical,
legal or policy standards and the acceptability of
biometric applications, Rebera et al. [176]. Since biometrics aﬀect millions
VULNERABILITIES OF BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS
31
of users, anti-spooﬁng technologies need a thorough study. However, spooﬁng is
a diﬃcult problem to address since the major objective is not only to detect and
prevent these attacks, but also to establish countermeasures that can ensure
the protection of user’s information and guarantee the trustworthiness of the
design, Marasco et al. [135]. Multimodal recognition is one of the approaches
that has been experimentally proven more secure against spooﬁng attacks,
contrary to the designs that implement a unimodal biometric or multi-factor
combinations, Biggio et al. [22]. However, according to the the analyses of
Akhtar et al. in [9] and Rodrigues et al. in [179] the lack of robustness can
be the major drawback of multimodal systems. This depends on the selection
of a fusion model and the applied matching algorithms to compute a ﬁnal
multimodal result. The issue is still an open research question, while recent
studies focus on the multimodal combinations and new score level fusion rules
to enhance the security of multimodal recognition designs, Jomaa et al. [105]
and Luckyanets et al. [127].
liveness-detection is the most common technique to detect
Furthermore,
physiological signs of life and recognize whether a biometric feature presented
at the sensor belongs to a living subject, discriminating a real human trait from
an artifact, Marcel et al. [136]. Several passive and active approaches have been
proposed in the literature, including the use of additional hardware means to
acquire temperature, pulse detection, blood pressure etc., and software means
to provide high-resolution images of the extracted biometric data, to detect
liveness information inherent to the obtained feature and to analyze multiple
captured instances of the same trait, Li and Jain [122]. In the last few years,
challenge-response active methods have been added to the research agenda. In
this approach the user is asked to interact with the system, i.e., to move his
head or to roll a ﬁnger across the sensor among others, Beham et al. [16], Chugh
et al. [53], Okereafor et al. [153] and Singh and Arora [196]. Liveness active and
passive analysis based on spooﬁng detection can oﬀer promising results although
they have not yet been extensively studied on large-scale datasets, Akhtar et
al. [10]. Their practical disadvantages include an additional cost of the hardware
scanner, a time-consuming authentication process, and an increase of the FRR
percentage where genuine users may be rejected as impostors, Sohankar et
al. [197]. These facts may aﬀect applicability of liveness-detection techniques in
commercial designs in a negative way.
Our contribution. We investigated the vulnerability of ﬁngerprint-based
schemes against several attacks including ﬁngerprint obfuscation and imperson-
ation. Based on datasets of spoofed samples, which are publicly available for
research purposes, we analyzed the system’s performance in terms of accuracy
and we addressed how security can be preserved under realistic scenarios.
Additionally, we focused on a bimodal system, consisting of ﬁngerprint and
32
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
facial biometrics, to study the robustness of a typical multimodal design against
spooﬁng attacks. Our analysis presented in [212] showed that multimodal
schemes can be aﬀected by attacks against a single biometric trait, while the
FAR probability mainly depends on the applied fusion technique. For this
reason, fusion plays an important role to attain an optimum trade-oﬀ between
performance and robustness.
Furthermore, we analyzed why an anti-spooﬁng method should not be designed
to operate as a stand-alone procedure. We mainly examined challenge-response
approaches on unimodal and multimodal architectures and we conducted a
theoretical analysis on how they could be applied in real-world use cases. We
concluded that in order to improve the robustness of multimodal systems, it
might be necessary to integrate the user’s match score with the scores provided by
the liveness detectors. Finally, in the context of the FIDELITY Project [67], we
examined the eﬀectiveness of challenge-response methods for secure automated
border control applications. The infrastructure of the ePassport identiﬁcation
documents requires secure data transmission, encrypted information storage
and high accuracy rates. We analyzed the robustness against identity theft if
additional security measures are implemented. In [211] presented in Part II,
we summarized our ﬁndings and we proposed a multimodal authentication
framework for ePassports based on our theoretical analyses and motivated by
the functionality of eGates at the immigration checkpoints in arrival halls of
airports. Our model was designed to combine two modalities using a score
level fusion; it used a Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) subsystem and a
liveness detection function to oﬀer increased security.
3.2 Security and Privacy in Biometric Designs
From ﬁngerprint scanners, embedded in smartphones, to border control
infrastructures, the use of biometric technologies has increased security and
privacy concerns. The major security and privacy threats related to biometrics
have been described extensively in the literature, Kindt [116] and Prabhakar
et al. [167] among others. However, security and privacy in biometric schemes
are seen as two diﬀerent, yet complementary ﬁelds, Campisi [39]. Cryptography
has become a powerful tool to address the potential vulnerabilities of biometric
recognition schemes, enhancing their robustness, Menezes et al. [142]. However,
a central question is whether a biometric trait can keep its source secret. The use
of biometrics can raise cultural, religious as well as ethnicity related concerns, Li
and Jain [122]. To some extent, biometrics are related to the loss of anonymity,
while it is a common belief that even when a biometric-based recognition
procedure is performed by a legislative authority, the collection and use of
SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
33
such a personal data unjustiﬁably violates the human rights to freedom and
autonomy, Podio [166]. This debate has been occurring for many years and will
continue until the public is completely satisﬁed with how the implementations
of biometric systems protect their interests and to what extent they aﬀect their
private lives, Kindt [115]. Over the last years, there is an increased awareness in
the need for security and privacy requirements for the protection of biometric
data both in civilian and commercial applications. Through legislation, national
and international organizations emphasize the importance of privacy-by-design
in biometric deployments. The concept refers to the approaches that combine
encryption techniques in accordance with both the security recommendations
and the privacy principles from the early stage of the design, Cavoukian [45].
Requirements as described below have been developed for privacy-friendly
biometric systems. For a detailed analysis, we refer the reader to Breebaart et
al. [34] and the ISO Standards for the protection of biometric information [92]
and [96].
3.2.1 Security Requirements
Security for biometric architectures is related to the technical characteristics
of the system and its overall robustness against the vulnerabilities presented
in Section 3.1. We ﬁrst introduce some terminology. A biometric reference is
the template that includes the binary representation of the biometric data
belonging to a user that can be used to recognize him in biometric applications.
An identity reference are the user’s credentials such as name, address etc. A
user may have several non-biometric identity references as a combination of
attributes that uniquely identiﬁes the entity in a particular system context. The
security of a biometric design revolves around several fundamental requirements
that are presented below.
Availability. The requirement is referred to the security mechanisms and
controls that should be established in order to guarantee that every part of the
system is available when this is necessary in order to protect the system from
accidental failures and physical or network attacks.
Entity Authenticity. This requirement ensures that all the entities involved
in the processing are the ones they claim to be.
Data Authenticity. This requirement includes the authenticity of the data
origin and the data integrity as explained by Menezes et al. in [142]. Data
origin ensures the genuineness and the originality of biometrics. Data integrity
is the condition that guarantees that the data are consistent, accurate and
correct. Security measures oﬀering integrity can also ensure that modiﬁcations
34
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
are detectable at all the software and hardware components involved in the
biometric system.
Conﬁdentiality. It ensures the secrecy of user data. No information when
biometrics are captured, templates are generated, transferred and stored should
be revealed to unauthorized parties. This also means that the templates should be
protected from any illegal access. The challenging issue is that the computational
parties involved in the matching process need access to the biometric references.
Non-repudiation. This requirement guarantees that the involved parties in a
biometric system, including the user, cannot deny that they have performed
a certain action. It also provides evidence for the entities and components
that took place in an action and for the messages that have been sent. As
described below, it is related to many privacy principles in order to ensure the
trustworthiness of the recognition procedure and the biometric architecture.
Non-invertibility/Irreversibility. The property refers to the application
of one-way functions to create a secure template with the user’s biometric
references such that knowledge of the transformed biometrics cannot be used to
obtain any information on the original biometric input, Ngo et al. [151].
Unlinkability. This property indicates that multiple biometric references
(transformed templates) from the same user cannot be linked to each other or to
the user from which they were derived. It is also related to the entities involved
in the matching process. This means that in an unlinkable biometric system, it
should not be possible to derive any further information on the relation between
the parties, Simoens et al. [194].
Permanence. It determines the validity period that correspond to a set of
stored templates and protected identity references.
Cancelability/Revocability. In case the security measures detect attack(s)
in the biometric system, the risk of compromised templates can be mitigated
by providing methods to cancel a biometric template in order to prevent future
successful veriﬁcation of a speciﬁc biometric reference for a given user’s identity.
Renewability. It guarantees the creation of new multiple,
independent
transformed biometric references derived from one or more biometric samples
from the same user. It permits their use to recognize the individual without
revealing information about the original biometric input or the already stored
templates. From a practical perspective, this security requirement is considered
very challenging as it is related to revocability, indicating the necessity for several
biometric references to allow an automated user’s re-enrollment in biometric
systems. In this way, the presence of the user for the re-enrollment procedure can
be avoided. The property also ensures the users’ data update after a time period
SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
35
and oﬀers a certain security level when the user utilizes the same biometric
features to access several applications.
3.2.2 Privacy Principles
Security requirements are not considered to be a solution in and of itself,
Gerber and Zimmermann [74]. For every given technology, the legal framework
establishes the criteria for the conﬁguration of a process, tool or system,
Bertino [19]. Given that the processing of each individual’s private information
is an essential criterion for the applicability of a biometric scheme, the system
needs to address the protection of biometric data. Additionally, a common
toolkit speciﬁes the privacy metrics to avoid any misunderstanding among
developers and users. For biometric designs, Data Protection Authorities
specify the following information: the formats for the interchange of biometric
information, the platform independence, the program interfaces, the application
proﬁles, the calculations and the methods for evaluation, Cavoukian [45]. Hence,
the architecture is neutral, without being in favor of any particular vendor
or biometric modality. Even if it is diﬃcult to categorize the properties as
security requirements or privacy principles, the concept of privacy for biometric
architectures is deﬁned as the ability of the user to control by whom and how
his personal data is collected and used, Kindt [115]. In practical terms, user
privacy in biometric application is determined by speciﬁc requirements knows
as privacy principles for biometric schemes. In Europe, as described by the ISO
Standards in [92] and [96] and addressed by the recent GDPR [66], the main
objectives of the privacy principles for biometric architectures are the following:
Consent, choice and respect to the application context. The legal
framework deﬁnes that the biometric data must be only used for the predeﬁned
purposes of the biometric application. Moreover, the choice whether the system
performs identiﬁcation or authentication functionalities requires an explicit legal
guideline. This is also depended on the sector (government civilian applications
or commercial applications) in which the biometrics are applied. This sector
determines the responsible authority for the legal extraction, processing and
storage of biometric references. The concept of consent is based on the fact
that the user holds the biometric data and he is well informed about their
processing and the scope of the biometric applications. Privacy principles
recommend that the storage of biometric data in CBDB should be avoided since
it implies additional privacy threats, Yang et al. [227]. However, if this process
is considered to be necessary, the biometric scheme should exclusively perform
authentication, being compliant with the recommendations of the European
Regulatory Technical Standards for Strong Customer Authentication [183].
36
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
Transparency and Accountability. The privacy principle of transparency
provides the users with meaningful notices about how the organizations
responsible for the biometric extraction, transmission and storage intend to
use the biometric technology in the speciﬁc application. Additionally, the users
must be informed about the encryption mechanisms that will be applied to
prevent the exposure of biometric data and the accuracy of the system related
to the error rates that may lead to its failure. Accountability is referred to the
reasonable steps that should be taken to ensure that all the parties involved in
the computation adhere to the principles presented above, Campisi [39].
Discriminability. Biometric references that disclose physiological or patho-
logical medical conditions, such as the retina patterns of the human eye that
can reveal health information and behavioral biometrics which are related to
neurological diseases, must not be used for unintended functional or application
scopes without the permission of the user who wishes to be recognized, Campisi
et al. [40]. This principle implies that the new GDPR [66] guarantees the user’s
control over his private data by prohibiting any covert identiﬁcation procedure
such as surveillance applications based on soft biometrics for individual
identiﬁcation in a crowd. It has also an international impact since organizations
established outside the EU are subject to the GDPR [66] when they process
personal data of EU citizens.
Accuracy and Rectiﬁcation. These principles require that the personal data
must be accurate and they should be kept up to date. They are related to the
security recommendations of revocability and renewability which should be
established to ensure that every reasonable step has be taken to guarantee that
