- Rogue Access Points (APs)
- Demonstration of Airsnarf
- Defense Strategies

### Disclaimer
This presentation and the accompanying example software are designed to highlight the inherent security vulnerabilities in publicly accessible wireless networks. The goal is to promote the use of more secure authentication methods for public 802.11b hotspots. Viewers and readers are responsible for their own actions and are strongly encouraged to act ethically.

### Example of a Hotspot Setup
1. **Visit the Hotspot Provider's Website**: Create a login account.
2. **Go to the Hotspot Location**: Bring your wireless device.
3. **Power On and Connect**: Associate with the network, obtain an IP address, DNS settings, etc.
4. **Open a Web Browser**: You will be redirected to a login page.
5. **Login and Authenticate**: After successful authentication, you will gain access to the internet.

**Is This Process Secure?**

### Access Point Vulnerabilities
- **Legitimate AP**: SSID: “goodguy”
- **Rogue AP**: SSID: “badguy”

A rogue AP can have a stronger signal or be physically closer, making it more likely for devices to connect to it instead of the legitimate one.

---

### Rogue Access Points (APs)
- **Definition**: An unauthorized access point.
- **Traditional Uses**:
  - Corporate back-doors
  - Corporate espionage
- **Hotspot Threats**:
  - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
  - Theft of user credentials
  - Cloning of legitimate APs

---

### Mechanics of Rogue APs in Hotspots
- **Create a Competing Hotspot**: The attacker sets up a rogue AP, which can be a real AP or a HostAP.
- **Captive Portal Manipulation**: Modify or create a captive portal behind the rogue AP.
- **Redirect Users**: Redirect users to a fake "splash" page.
- **Attack Methods**:
  - DoS attacks
  - Credential theft
  - Bold attackers may visit the hotspot location directly.
  - Less bold attackers may drive by with a high-powered antenna.

### Airsnarf
- **Overview**: Airsnarf is a tool that simplifies the setup of a rogue AP.
- **Features**:
  - Simplifies the configuration of HostAP, HTTP server, DHCP server, Net::DNS, and iptables.
  - Provides a simple example of a rogue AP.
- **Demonstration**: A live demonstration will be provided.

---

### Defense Strategies
- **Local AP Awareness**: Regularly scan for and identify rogue APs.
- **Customer Education**: Educate users about the risks and how to identify legitimate hotspots.
- **One-Time Authentication Mechanisms**: Use secure, one-time authentication methods.
- **Free Access**: Consider not charging for hotspot access to reduce the incentive for credential theft.
