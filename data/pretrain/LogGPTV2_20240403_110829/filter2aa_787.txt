Disclaimer
• This presentation and example software are 
intended to demonstrate the inherent 
security flaws in publicly accessible 
wireless architectures and promote the use 
of safer authentication mechanisms for 
public 802.11b hotspots.  Viewers and 
readers are responsible for their own actions 
and strongly encouraged to behave 
themselves.
Example HotSpot Setup
• Visit hotspot provider website and create 
login
• Visit hotspot with wireless device
• Power on, associate, get IP, DNS, etc.
• Open web browser and get redirected
• Login, backend authentication & billing, 
welcome to the Internet
Is this secure?

Rogue APs?
• Rogue AP = an unauthorized access point
• Traditional
– corporate back-doors
– corporate espionage
• Hotspots
– DoS
– theft of user credentials
– AP “cloning”
Hotspot Rogue AP Mechanics
• “Create a competing hotspot.”
• AP can be actual AP or HostAP
• Create or modify captive portal behind AP
• Redirect users to “splash” page
• DoS or theft of user credentials
• Bold attacker will visit ground zero.
• Not-so-bold will drive-by with an amp.
Airsnarf
• Nothing special
• Simplifies HostAP, httpd, dhcpd, Net::DNS, 
and iptables setup
• Simple example rogue AP
• Demonstration
Defense Strategies
• Local AP awareness
• Customer education
• One-time authentication mechanisms
• Don’t charge for hotspot access?
