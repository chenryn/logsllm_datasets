tent placement, context-aware applications, and mobile advertise-
ment system. Taking content placement as an example, if content
providers know that some of their apps are most used at certain lo-
cations, they may choose to place content close to those locations
so that users experience better performance.
4.3.1 Local Smartphone Apps
We ﬁrst examine whether any apps are local apps, i.e., whether
the majority of an app’s trafﬁc comes from a region. We perform
the following analysis: for each app, we divide its trafﬁc by (U.S.)
state of the user, and compute the top 1, 3 and 5 state(s) that con-
tribute the most trafﬁc volume or the longest network access times.
We expect that if an app’s usage is truly localized, most of its traf-
ﬁc or access time (e.g., 90%) will originate from a small number of
states.

contribution of traffic (%)
Figure 6: contribution of volume from top X states.
Figure 6 shows the CDF of the fraction of the trafﬁc volume from
top 1, 3, and 5 states for top 1000 apps that we have chosen in §4.2.
According to Figure 6, 20% of the popular apps have more than
90% of their trafﬁc volume originating from 3 states, 5.8% of the
popular apps have 90% of the trafﬁc originating from only 1 state,
and 1.7% of the popular apps have all their trafﬁc from 1 state.
These 20% apps, which have more than 90% of their trafﬁc volume
originating from 3 states, account for 2% trafﬁc in the smartphone
apps category. The distribution of the contribution of access time
of popular apps are very close to the one of trafﬁc volume. Thus,
we see that a signiﬁcant number of the popular apps are local.
To explore what these local apps are and where they are local-
ized, we examine in more detail the 100 most local apps based on
the contribution of the top 3 states; for each of these apps, the top 3
states contribute at least 97% of their total trafﬁc volume. Figure 7
shows the distribution of the top 3 states of the 100 most local apps;
we differentiate the rank of the top 3 states for these 100 local apps
as well so that we know, for example, California is the state that
originated the most trafﬁc for 19 apps, the state originated the sec-
ond most trafﬁc for 15 apps, and the state originated the third most
trafﬁc for 12 apps. As expected, California, Texas, and New York
are the states with most local apps – these are the states with large
populations of smartphone users. However, there are many states
with much smaller populations such as Louisiana, Wyoming, and
Kentucky that also have some local apps; upon further analysis, this
turn out to be because content from some apps is tailored speciﬁ-
cally for users from some regions, e.g., local TV programs, news,
radio, weather apps, etc. As an example for validation, we show
the local apps for Louisiana in Table 3; we see that the six apps that
have most of their trafﬁc originating from Louisiana provide TV,
news, radio and weather speciﬁcally for Louisiana residents.
We also explore the genre-wise breakdown of the local apps, as
the genre of an app reﬂects the content and service type of a smart-

phone app to a great degree. Table 4 shows the distribution of the
genres of the 100 most local apps in Table 7. According to Table 4,
these apps are mostly news, weather, and entertainment apps, likely
due to the local nature of their content, i.e., local weather, local
news, local TV, etc. In music, the local apps are usually online lo-
cal radio stations. The local education apps are typically created by
universities, and mostly used by the local student populations.
4.3.2 National Smartphone Apps
Next, we examine the spatial patterns of smartphone app usage
nation-wide. For this analysis, we remove the 100 apps identiﬁed
as local in the previous analysis (Section 4.3.1), and examine the
nation-wide usage of the remaining apps’ trafﬁc. We term these
remaining apps as national apps. Our analysis explores whether
certain genres are more popular (or have heavier usage) in some
areas than in other areas; in general, we do not expect users to pre-
fer using apps of a speciﬁc genre as a function of their geographic
location, but our results show that this does happen under certain
conditions.
