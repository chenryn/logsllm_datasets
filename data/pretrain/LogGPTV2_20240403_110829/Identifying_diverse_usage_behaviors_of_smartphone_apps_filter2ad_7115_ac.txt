### 4.3.1 Local Smartphone Apps

To determine if any apps are local, meaning the majority of their traffic originates from a specific region, we conducted the following analysis: For each app, we divided its traffic by the U.S. state of the user and calculated the top 1, 3, and 5 states that contributed the most traffic volume or had the longest network access times. We expected that if an app's usage is truly localized, a significant portion (e.g., 90%) of its traffic or access time would originate from a small number of states.

**Figure 6: Contribution of Traffic Volume from Top X States**

Figure 6 illustrates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the fraction of traffic volume from the top 1, 3, and 5 states for the top 1000 apps selected in ยง4.2. According to the figure, 20% of popular apps have more than 90% of their traffic volume originating from 3 states. Additionally, 5.8% of these apps have 90% of their traffic coming from only one state, and 1.7% of the apps have all their traffic from a single state. These 20% of apps, which have over 90% of their traffic volume from 3 states, account for 2% of the total traffic in the smartphone apps category. The distribution of the contribution of access time for popular apps is very similar to that of traffic volume. This indicates that a significant number of popular apps are indeed local.

To further explore the nature and localization of these local apps, we examined the 100 most local apps based on the contribution of the top 3 states, where the top 3 states contribute at least 97% of the total traffic volume. **Figure 7: Distribution of Top 3 States for the 100 Most Local Apps** shows the distribution of the top 3 states for these 100 local apps. We also differentiated the rank of the top 3 states, revealing that California is the state with the most traffic for 19 apps, the second most for 15 apps, and the third most for 12 apps. As expected, California, Texas, and New York, which have large populations of smartphone users, are the states with the most local apps. However, smaller states like Louisiana, Wyoming, and Kentucky also have some local apps. Further analysis revealed that this is because the content from some apps is tailored specifically for users in certain regions, such as local TV programs, news, radio, and weather apps.

**Table 3: Local Apps from Louisiana**

| App | Description on Google |
|-----|-----------------------|
| WWLTV | New Orleans News, Breaking News, Weather... |
| KATC | News Coverage at Acadiana-Lafayette, Louisiana... |
| KSLA | News, Weather and Sports at Shreveport, Louisiana... |
| KPLC 7 | News |
| WBRZ | TV Channel 2 Baton Rouge, LA... |
| GoWAFB | Local news, weather... at Baton Rouge, LA... |

For validation, Table 3 lists the local apps for Louisiana, showing that the six apps with the most traffic from Louisiana provide TV, news, radio, and weather specifically for Louisiana residents.

We also analyzed the genre-wise breakdown of the local apps, as the genre reflects the content and service type of a smartphone app. **Table 4: Genre Distribution of the 100 Most Local Apps** shows that these apps are mostly news, weather, and entertainment apps, likely due to the local nature of their content, such as local weather, local news, and local TV. In the music genre, local apps are often online local radio stations. Local education apps are typically created by universities and are mostly used by local student populations.

### 4.3.2 National Smartphone Apps

Next, we examined the spatial patterns of smartphone app usage nationwide. For this analysis, we excluded the 100 apps identified as local in the previous section (Section 4.3.1) and analyzed the nationwide usage of the remaining apps' traffic. We term these remaining apps as national apps. Our analysis explored whether certain genres are more popular or have heavier usage in some areas compared to others. Generally, we do not expect users to prefer apps of a specific genre based on their geographic location, but our results show that this does occur under certain conditions.

**Table 4: Genre Distribution of the 100 Most Local Apps**

| Genre | # Apps |
|-------|--------|
| News | 45 |
| Weather | 1 |
| Entertainment | 3 |
| Social Media | 1 |
| Music | 45 |
| Education | 1 |

This table provides a clear overview of the genre distribution, highlighting the dominance of news, weather, and entertainment apps among the local apps.
