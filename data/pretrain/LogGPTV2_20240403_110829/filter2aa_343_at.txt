Appendix B    Open Directory Password Server Authentication Methods
WebDAV-Digest Password Validation
WebDAV-Digest handles Digest-MD5 password validation for the WebDAV protocol, 
which is used to authenticate access to an iDisk. You should keep WebDAV-Digest 
enabled so that users can mount iDisks and other WebDAV servers in the Finder. 
WebDAV-Digest encodes passwords when they are sent over the network, and stores 
them in a scrambled form on the server. It offers good security during network 
transmission. A malicious user might be able to obtain passwords by gaining access to 
the server and decoding the password file, although doing this would be very difficult.

Appendix

C Authentication Manager
Mac OS X Server supports users that were configured to 
use the legacy Authentication Manager technology in 
Mac OS X Server version 10.0–10.2.
Authentication Manager is a legacy technology for securely validating passwords of the 
following users:
• Users of Windows services (including support for SMB-NT, SMB-LM, and CRAM-MD5)
• Users of Apple file service whose Mac OS 8 computers have not been upgraded with 
AFP client software version 3.8.3 or later
• Users who need to authenticate for mail service by using APOP or CRAM-MD5
Authentication Manager only works with user accounts that were created in a NetInfo 
domain of Mac OS X Server version 10.0–10.2. Authentication Manager must have been 
enabled for the NetInfo domain.
When you upgrade a server to Mac OS X Server version 10.3 from an earlier version that 
has Authentication Manager enabled, it remains enabled. Existing users can continue to 
use their same passwords. An existing user account uses Authentication Manager if the 
account is in a NetInfo domain for which Authentication Manager has been enabled 
and the account is set to use a crypt password.
After upgrading a server to Mac OS X Server version 10.3, you can change existing user 
accounts to authenticate using Open Directory. Open Directory authentication is the 
preferred authentication option for users of Windows services and is required for 
domain login from a Windows workstation to a Mac OS X Server primary domain 
controller. New user accounts created in Mac OS X Server version 10.3 are set to use 
Open Directory authentication.

Glossary
Glossary
Active Directory  The directory service of Microsoft Windows 2000 and 2003 servers.
administrator  A user with server or directory domain administration privileges. 
Administrators are always members of the predefined “admin” group. 
administrator computer  A Mac OS X computer onto which you have installed the 
server administration applications from the Mac OS X Server Admin CD. 
AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)  A client/server protocol used by Apple file service on 
Macintosh-compatible computers to share files and network services. AFP uses TCP/IP 
and other protocols to communicate between computers on a network.
authentication  The process of proving a user’s identity, typically by validating a user 
name and password. Usually authentication occurs before an authorization process 
determines the user’s level of access to a resource. For example, file service authorizes 
full access to folders and files that an authenticated user owns.
authentication authority attribute  A value that identifies the password validation 
scheme specified for a user and provides additional information as required. 
authorization  The process by which a service determines whether it should grant a 
user access to a resource and how much access the service should allow the user to 
have. Usually authorization occurs after an authentication process proves the user’s 
identity. For example, file service authorizes full access to folders and files that an 
authenticated user owns.
BSD (Berkeley System Distribution)  A version of UNIX on which Mac OS X software 
is based.
child  A computer that gets configuration information from the shared directory 
domain of a parent.
class  See object class.
computer account  A list of computers that have the same preference settings and are 
available to the same users and groups.

Glossary    
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)  A protocol used to distribute IP 
addresses to client computers. Each time a client computer starts up, the protocol looks 
for a DHCP server and then requests an IP address from the DHCP server it finds. The 
DHCP server checks for an available IP address and sends it to the client computer 
along with a lease period—the length of time the client computer may use the address.
directory domain  A specialized database that stores authoritative information about 
users and network resources; the information is needed by system software and 
applications. The database is optimized to handle many requests for information and to 
find and retrieve information quickly. Also called a directory node or simply a directory.
directory domain hierarchy  A way of organizing local and shared directory domains. A 
hierarchy has an inverted tree structure, with a root domain at the top and local 
domains at the bottom.
directory node  See directory domain.
directory services  Services that provide system software and applications with 
uniform access to directory domains and other sources of information about users and 
resources.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  A protocol that allows computers to transfer files over a 
network. FTP clients using any operating system that supports FTP can connect to a file 
server and download files, depending on their access privileges. Most Internet browsers 
and a number of freeware applications can be used to access an FTP server.
group  A collection of users who have similar needs. Groups simplify the administration 
of shared resources.
group directory  A directory that organizes documents and applications of special 
interest to group members and allows group members to pass information back and 
forth among them.
guest user  A user who can log in to your server without a user name or password. 
hash  An encrypted form of a password or other text.
home directory  A folder for a user’s personal use. Mac OS X also uses the home 
directory, for example, to store system preferences and managed user settings for Mac 
OS X users.
IP (Internet Protocol)  Also known as IPv4. A method used with Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) to send data between computers over a local network or the Internet. IP 
delivers packets of data, while TCP keeps track of data packets.
IP address  A unique numeric address that identifies a computer on the Internet.

Kerberos  A secure network authentication system. Kerberos uses tickets, which are 
issued for a specific user, service, and period of time. Once a user is authenticated, it is 
possible to access additional services without retyping a password (this is called single-
signon) for services that have been configured to take Kerberos tickets. Mac OS X 
Server uses Kerberos v5.
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)  A standard client-server protocol for 
accessing a directory domain.
local domain  A directory domain that can be accessed only by the computer on which 
it resides.
long name  See user name.
Mac OS X  The latest version of the Apple operating system. Mac OS X combines the 
reliability of UNIX with the ease of use of Macintosh. 
Mac OS X Server  An industrial-strength server platform that supports Mac, Windows, 
UNIX, and Linux clients out of the box and provides a suite of scalable workgroup and 
network services plus advanced remote management tools. 
managed client  A user, group, or computer whose access privileges and/or 
preferences are under administrative control.
managed preferences  System or application preferences that are under administrative 
control. Workgroup Manager allows administrators to control settings for certain 
system preferences for Mac OS X managed clients. Macintosh Manager allows 
administrators to control both system preferences and application preferences for 
Mac OS 9 and Mac OS 8 managed clients.
NetInfo  One of the Apple protocols for accessing a directory domain.
object class  A set of rules that define similar objects in a directory domain by 
specifying attributes that each object must have and other attributes that each object 
may have.
Open Directory  The Apple directory services architecture, which can access 
authoritative information about users and network resources from directory domains 
that use LDAP, NetInfo, or Active Directory protocols; BSD configuration files; and 
network services.
open source  A term for the cooperative development of software by the Internet 
community. The basic principle is to involve as many people as possible in writing and 
debugging code by publishing the source code and encouraging the formation of a 
large community of developers who will submit modifications and enhancements.

Glossary    
owner  The person who created a file or folder and who therefore has the ability to 
assign access privileges for other users. The owner of an item automatically has read/
write privileges for that item. An owner can also transfer ownership of an item to 
another user.
parent  A computer whose shared directory domain provides configuration 
information to another computer. 
primary group  A user’s default group. The file system uses the ID of the primary group 
when a user accesses a file he or she doesn’t own. 
primary group ID  A unique number that identifies a primary group.
protocol  A set of rules that determines how data is sent back and forth between two 
applications. 
Rendezvous  A protocol developed by Apple for automatic discovery of computers, 
devices, and services on IP networks. This proposed Internet standard protocol is 
sometimes referred to as “ZeroConf” or “multicast DNS.” For more information, visit 
www.apple.com or www.zeroconf.org.
schema  The collection of attributes and record types or classes that provide a 
blueprint for the information in a directory domain.
search path  See search policy.
search policy  A list of directory domains searched by a Mac OS X computer when it 
needs configuration information; also the order in which domains are searched. 
Sometimes called a search path.
share point  A folder, hard disk (or hard disk partition), or CD that is accessible over the 
network. A share point is the point of access at the top level of a group of shared items. 
Share points can be shared using AFP, Windows SMB, NFS (an “export”), or FTP protocols.
short name  An abbreviated name for a user. The short name is used by Mac OS X for 
home directories, authentication, and email addresses.
single signon  An authentication strategy that relieves users from entering a name and 
password separately for every network service. Mac OS X Server uses Kerberos to 
enable single signon.
SLP (Service Location Protocol) DA (Directory Agent)  A protocol that registers 
services available on a network and gives users easy access to them. When a service is 
added to the network, the service uses SLP to register itself on the network. SLP/DA 
uses a centralized repository for registered network services.

SMB (Server Message Block)  A protocol that allows client computers to access files 
and network services. It can be used over TCP/IP, the Internet, and other network 
protocols. Windows services use SMB to provide access to servers, printers, and other 
network resources.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)  An Internet protocol that allows you to send encrypted, 
authenticated information across the Internet.
user name  The long name for a user, sometimes referred to as the user’s “real” name. 
See also short name.
WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)  A live authoring 
environment that allows client users to check out webpages, make changes, and then 
check the pages back in while a site is running.
WebDAV realm  A region of a website, usually a folder or directory, that is defined to 
provide access for WebDAV users and groups.
