User: Can someone tell me how to make my script callable in any directory?
My script simply returns the number of files in a directory. I would like it to work in any directory by invoking it, instead of first being copied there and then typing python myscript.py
I am using Mac OS X, but is there a common way to get it installed on Windows and Linux?
Assistant: All of those operating systems should support a PATH environment variable which specifies directories that have executables that should be available everywhere. Make your script executable by chmod +x and place it into one of those directories (or add a new one to your PATH - I have ~/bin for instance).
I don't know how to make new kinds of files directly executable on Windows, though, but I guess you could use a .bat file as a proxy.
