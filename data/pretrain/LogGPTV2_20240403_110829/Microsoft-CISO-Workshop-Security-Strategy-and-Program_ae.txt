Next: Business Resilience
The person who owns and accepts the risk is the 
person that explains to the world what went wrong 
(often in front of TV cameras).
1. Who is accountable for security vulnerabilities & incidents? 	a. Business Asset Owners? IT Teams? Security?
b. At what organizational level? 
2. What is the highest level of executive interaction on security topics/risks? 	How frequently?3. Is there a specific board member or committee that oversees security? 	a. Does the CISO (or CIO) meet with them regularly?
4. How do conflicts of interest get resolved between security and IT (or business) 	functions?
What gets measured gets managed 
What gets mismeasured gets mismanaged
	- Rory Sutherland
1. How are you measuring security and compliance today? 
a. Do you use KPIs, KRIs, OKRs, or other?b. Do you measure & report security resiliency or organizational resiliency?
2. How are security risks integrated into the organizations’ 	risk management framework?
3. How are security priorities aligned to organizational priorities? 
To cloud/digital transformation?
“Trust is knowing that when a team member does push you, they're doing it because they care about the team.”― Patrick Lencioni1. How are you investing into integrating security into business and IT processes? 
a. How prepared are organizational leaders to make security/risk decisions?
b. How prepared are business line leaders to make security/risk decisions?
2. What would business and IT leaders say about the progress on that 	integration?
3. How is security budgeted? Proportional to IT? to organization’s FTEs or 	revenue? Ad Hoc/Custom?|  | Program Maturity Path | Program Maturity Path | Program Maturity Path |  |

1. What security framework do you adhere to today?2. How are lessons learned from incidents integrated into security, IT, and 	business processes?
3. How well do you balance investments across prevention vs. 	detection/response/recovery?
a. Do you have a dedicated operations function focused on incident 	response? (aka Security Operations Center or SOC)
b. Do you have a dedicated operations function focused on prevention? 	(e.g. security posture management team)c. Are these functions represented in technology leadership meetings?
