**ATT&CK ID:** T1648  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Serverless Execution

Adversaries may exploit serverless computing, integration, and automation services to execute arbitrary code within cloud environments. Many cloud providers offer a range of serverless resources, such as compute engines, application integration services, and web servers. These resources can be leveraged by attackers to run malicious code without the need for traditional infrastructure, making detection and mitigation more challenging.
