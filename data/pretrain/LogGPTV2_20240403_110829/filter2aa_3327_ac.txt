they can be queried by various regulatory processes. Another condition of persistence is avoiding
attribution of the process misbehavior to a malicious misuse. This can be achieved by timing attacks
to the speciﬁc events to misdirect operators’ attention.

Preliminary Analysis
Distilled products represent the most valuable commodities leaving a reﬁnery or chemical plant.
Therefore maximum economic damage could be achieved by destroying the pipe that carries the
ﬁnal product into the storage vessels. This attack is certainly effective, but it will also be noticed and
quickly ﬁxed. For a prolonged damaging effect the attacker needs better scenarios.
Figure 5.1: Simpliﬁed scheme of VAC plant
The VAC plant can be roughly divided into two parts: reaction and reﬁnement (Fig. 5.1). The
reﬁnement section is responsible for VAC distillation to ensure a ﬁnal product meeting rigid speciﬁ-
cations. The reﬁnement process consists of multiple units so the attacker has many opportunities to
tamper with the process, but the operator also has many opportunities to notice changes and take
compensating actions. Moreover, the operator may send impure product for extra reﬁnement. In
contrast, upsetting the reaction process inside of the reactor reliably yields reduced production of a
useful product. With that, we we resolve to attack the reactor unit.
Most factors inﬂuencing the reaction process can be described by either deactivation catalyst
caused by high temperatures, reduction of reaction rate due to wrong ratio and/or preconditioning of
the chemical components or reduction of the primarily reaction due to wrong material and energy
balance. These will be the attack scenarios considered in this work.
6. Attaining Attack Objectives
We now have a rough idea about how our speciﬁc malicious goal can be possibly achieved but not
yet a ﬁnal attack design. An attack will need to be delivered as a series of commands that manipulate
the process to achieve the desired effects. Using the model described above, a speciﬁc set of attacks
can be selected and developed for ﬁnal delivery in the malign payload.
6.1
Access
When considering hacking into a VAC process somewhere in the world, one must remember that
this is a real facility with real-world needs. Data needs to ﬂow, predictions need to be made, and
equipment needs to be maintained. It has been said that all chemical plants start up in a state of
imminent failure and then remain that way. When working with a model, it is easy to look at a
process environment as static and stable. In reality, there are dedicated teams of workers whose
sole purpose is to ﬁx and improve the plant year round. Small armies of workers, consultants, and
engineers come and go regularly. An attacker can take advantage of any of these interactions.
6.2
Discovery
The chemical approach to VAC manufacturing is not a trade secret. There is a wealth of information
on the process itself and how it is typically implemented in a factory. We assume that the attacker has
already obtained knowledge about the process such as presented in Section 4.1. Here, we concentrate
on discovering measurements and actuators available to the attacker at the reactor section.
In industrial plants, large numbers of process variables must be maintained within speciﬁed limits
in order for the plant to operate properly. Therefore process monitoring plays a key role in ensuring
that plant performance satisﬁes the operating objectives. Abnormal process operation can occur
for a variety of reasons including equipment problems, instrumentation malfunction, disturbances,
etc. Sensor and monitoring equipment placement must satisfy three general objectives: (i) routine
monitoring for speciﬁed limits; (ii) detection and diagnosis of abnormal operations; (iii) preventive
monitoring for early indicators of equipment and process upsets. However, utilization of a large
22
Chapter 6. Attaining Attack Objectives
number of sensors increases the required investment and maintenance costs and optimal sensor
placement is an active research area. As a result the attacker may face the challenge of lacking the
sensors needed to monitor her attack.
Six sensors, XMEAS{1-6} and one ﬂow composition analyzer are available to attacker at the
reactor unit, vaporizer{P;L;T}, heater exit{T}, reactor exit{T;F}, and molar concentrations of the
seven chemical elements in the reactor feed stream from analyzer, XMEAS{37-43}. Speciﬁcally, O2
concentration is used to monitor the hazardous conditions related to the explosivity of ethylene in the
presence of oxygen. What might catch the attacker’s eye is the absence of an analyzer in the reactor
exit stream. Thus she will not be able to directly obtain measurements of the molar concentration of
the produced vinyl acetate in the reactor outﬂow.1
There are seven degrees of freedom XMV{1-7} available for control in the reactor unit, three
reactants fresh feeds {O2;C2H4;HAc}, two valves to control vaporize{heater; vapor exit}, reactor
preheater valve, and steam drum valve to control the reactor temperature. A quick analysis of the
process ﬂowsheet shows that all valves except XMV(3) control effects within the reactor unit itself.
Thus, part of the ascetic acid inﬂow controlled by XMV(3) is sent into the vaporizer (reactor unit)
and another part into the absorber (reﬁnement section). Also, HAc comes from a supply tank. It
means any attack on this feed will be buffered by the acetic acid holdup in the tank. Incidentally,
we had discovered a disparity between process documentation and process implementation. Thus,
inﬂow of ethylene XMV(2) is used to control the pressure in the absorber and not the pressure in the
gas recycle loop. Thus any manipulation of this control loop will have effects on both the reactor
and reﬁnement sections.
A sensor measuring a process variable important for safety or operating constraints will have
an alarm or interlock set at certain operating ranges (see Section 4.1). A quick search of chemical
engineering journals turns up information on the constraints and speciﬁcs of the process. Exact
values can be discovered in operator screens, controller logic, one-line diagrams, etc. The basic
plumbing of the process can be understood from the ﬂow diagram (Fig. 4.1). In a real world scenario,
this information would needed to be gathered from conﬁguration ﬁles and other sources as described
in Section 3.2.
6.3
Control
At this stage the attacker explores dynamic responses of the process to various manipulations.
Typically, digital controllers are designed based on process models and with very few exceptions the
designs begin with the speciﬁcation of some desired closed loop properties. The more proprietary
information on the process dynamics and controller tuning the attacker can collect, the more
accurately she would be able to identify the system. Some of the simulation results of the process
response to step changes in a few set points are described in [40]. The authors mention that some
dynamic behaviors of this process are not intuitively obvious.
Understanding basic factors that inﬂuence dynamic effects of process behavior is fundamental
to process control analysis. Thus, every controller is designed and tuned to perform at a certain
operational range and may lose its authority in different operating conditions. This is among other
reasons related to the non-linearity of most physical processes. It means that process response is not
proportional to the applied input. For instance, the dynamic behavior of a process being heated from
140 to 150 degrees will be different from when it is further heated till 160 degrees. If the process

such as safety or signiﬁcant product quality improvement.
6.3 Control
23
was never expected to be heated to 160 degrees, the control algorithm may never have been tested
for its performance in this temperature range.
For two control loops to operate successfully in tandem each loop must “know” what the other
is doing. Otherwise trying to achieve their respective objectives the two loops may act against the
interest of the other. This phenomenon is known as loop interaction. Some control loop interactions
occur naturally as a result of their physical and chemical make-up. Some loop interactions may
arise as a consequence of process design. Typical examples are heat integration and recycle streams
which create the potential for disturbance propagation and the alteration of dynamic system behavior.
Without knowing the exact plant conﬁguration it is not always possible to correctly determine
whether a certain process response is related to a fundamental property of the plant or is a result of a
speciﬁc attack parameter choice.
While the attacker may apply many different attack patterns, in this work we consider the two
following attacks:
• Steady state attacks – step-like attacks which bring the process into the new state and leave
it there (Fig. 6.1a).
• Periodic attacks – recurring attacks interleaved with process recovery phases (Fig. 6.1b).

Figure 6.1: Types of attacks on process behavior (red line denotes steady state value)
The control phase is mostly about mapping out the dependencies between each actuator and
all of the downstream measurements.
Mapping of the dependencies can be done through detailed modeling or observations on the process
itself. An attacker can make small changes in the process and then note those changes as they
propagate through the various sensors. Whilst working with the model one can observe alarm
generation and propagation. If this was an actual process, the attacker would need to make minor
changes and then extrapolate how large a change was necessary to cause an unwanted result.
We applied the following strategy to discovering dynamic process behavior. We ﬁrst identiﬁed
the steady state MV values. We than increased or decreased MV by approximately 1% for 30 sec
and observed the process response measured by sensors. Depending on the response we increased

operational or safety constraints.
Steady state attacks (SSA). Not all actuators are suitable for carrying out steady state attacks.
XMV{4;5} move the process to its operational or safety constraints within a short time (from minutes
to few hours) even if manipulated only slightly.
Periodic attack (PA). This attack scenario can be seen as pulse-width modulation of a steady
state attack in which pulse amplitude represents attack value (position of the valve), pulse width
stands for attack duration and inter-pulse distance is process recovery time. Examining the sensitivity
of control loops to periodic attacks is challenging due to the large number of attack parameters.
Initially we looked at attacks directly setting the position of the valve at the recovery phase (to
the steady state value or lower). However, this strategy was unsuccessful for the majority of control
loops resulting in critical process variables drifting towards their constraints. This is because MVs
were set to ﬁxed values without adjustment to the process dynamics. Therefore we decided to leave
administration of the process recovery phase to the controllers.
One of the challenges we faced was control loop ringing while manipulating XMV(5) which
controls the vaporizer exit ﬂow. Sometimes, digital controllers produce a control signal that oscillates
with decreasing amplitude around the ﬁnal equilibrium level (Fig. 6.2a). This phenomenon is known
as “ringing” and is caused by negative real controller poles. Ringing is an unwanted effect as it
increases the wear and tear of controller components and can cause system instability within a
multi-loop environment. Manipulation of XMV(5) in the negative direction (decreasing its value)
causes a large overshoot which leads to process instability. In our simulations it manifested itself in
form of impossible computations.

We still pursued this attack as reducing inﬂow of reactants would result in decreased production
of VAC. To overcome the above challenge we decided to take advantage of the negative compensation
reaction in the process recovery phase. In our approach we slightly increase the ﬂow for 1-2 minutes
and let the process recover for 2 minutes or longer (Fig. 6.2b). In the recovery phase the controller
decreased the ﬂow to bring the CV to the set point. In this way we were able to achieve reduced

ﬂow (when averaged over time). Overall, there are three control loops in the reactor unit which can
become unstable under certain attack parameters. Those are XMV{2;4;5}.
Outcome of the control stage
We have exhaustively tested all control loops for their sensitivity against a large number of attack
settings {attack value; attack duration; recovery time}. Although we could establish a good mental
model of process behavior, we needed to ﬁnd a systematic way to categorize controlled loops. We
decided on two parameters: sensitivity to magnitude of manipulation (MM) – how much we can
change the process – and to required recovery time (RT). If the process can recover in a time equal
to the attack time or shorter we consider such such control loops of low sensitivity. Table 6.1 gives
the results of our analysis. Sensitive control loops are risky for reliable control.

We concluded with an analysis of alarm activation in response to control loop manipulations
(Table 6.2). For each MV we noted upper limits of the attack parameters which would allow
to manipulate the process without triggering an alarm (not included into the paper due to space
limitation).2

Damage
In the previous stage we evaluated the potential to control the process. In the damage phase the
attacker tests those controls to achieve the damage desired. This stage is similar to the “what occurs
if” approach deployed in a HAZOP analysis (“what happens if this valve is closed?”).
The attacker must choose one or more attack scenarios to deploy in the ﬁnal payload. This could
be arbitrarily chosen based on gut feeling, but given the amount of effort it takes to mount a real

metric would be the amount of monetary loss to the victim.
