### Regulatory Queries and Persistence Conditions

Processes can be queried by various regulatory mechanisms. A key condition for persistence is to avoid attributing process anomalies to malicious misuse. This can be achieved by timing attacks to coincide with specific events, thereby misdirecting operators' attention.

### 5.1 Preliminary Analysis

Distilled products are among the most valuable commodities produced in a refinery or chemical plant. Therefore, maximum economic damage could be inflicted by destroying the pipe that carries the final product to storage vessels. While this attack would be effective, it would also be quickly noticed and repaired. For a more prolonged and damaging effect, the attacker needs to consider better scenarios.

#### Simplified Scheme of VAC Plant

The VAC (Vinyl Acetate) plant can be broadly divided into two sections: the reaction section and the refinement section (Figure 5.1). The refinement section is responsible for distilling VAC to meet stringent specifications. This process involves multiple units, providing numerous opportunities for tampering. However, it also offers many chances for operators to detect and mitigate changes. Additionally, impure products can be sent for further refinement. In contrast, disrupting the reaction process within the reactor reliably reduces the production of useful products. Thus, we focus on attacking the reactor unit.

Factors influencing the reaction process include:
- Deactivation of catalysts due to high temperatures
- Reduction in reaction rate due to incorrect ratios or preconditioning of chemical components
- Imbalance in material and energy, leading to reduced primary reactions

These will be the primary attack scenarios considered in this work.

### 6. Attaining Attack Objectives

We now have a general idea of how our malicious goal can be achieved, but not yet a finalized attack design. An attack will need to be delivered as a series of commands that manipulate the process to achieve the desired effects. Using the model described above, specific attack scenarios can be selected and developed for the final payload.

#### 6.1 Access

When considering hacking into a VAC process, one must remember that this is a real facility with real-world needs. Data must flow, predictions must be made, and equipment must be maintained. It is often said that all chemical plants start in a state of imminent failure and remain so. In reality, dedicated teams continuously fix and improve the plant. These interactions provide potential entry points for an attacker.

#### 6.2 Discovery

The chemical approach to VAC manufacturing is not a trade secret. There is ample information available on the process and its implementation. We assume the attacker has already acquired knowledge about the process, as outlined in Section 4.1. Here, we focus on discovering the measurements and actuators available to the attacker in the reactor section.

In industrial plants, numerous process variables must be maintained within specified limits for proper operation. Process monitoring is crucial for ensuring performance meets operational objectives. Abnormal operations can occur due to equipment problems, instrumentation malfunctions, or disturbances. Sensor placement must satisfy three objectives:
1. Routine monitoring for specified limits
2. Detection and diagnosis of abnormal operations
3. Preventive monitoring for early indicators of equipment and process upsets

However, the use of a large number of sensors increases investment and maintenance costs, making optimal sensor placement an active research area. The attacker may face challenges due to the lack of necessary sensors.

At the reactor unit, the attacker has access to six sensors (XMEAS{1-6}) and one flow composition analyzer. Specific sensors include:
- Vaporizer pressure (P), level (L), and temperature (T)
- Heater exit temperature (T)
- Reactor exit temperature (T) and flow (F)
- Molar concentrations of seven chemical elements in the reactor feed stream (XMEAS{37-43})

Notably, there is no analyzer in the reactor exit stream, preventing direct measurement of the molar concentration of the produced vinyl acetate.

There are seven degrees of freedom (XV{1-7}) available for control in the reactor unit:
- Three reactants fresh feeds (O2, C2H4, HAc)
- Two valves to control vaporization (heater, vapor exit)
- Reactor preheater valve
- Steam drum valve to control reactor temperature

A quick analysis shows that all valves except XV(3) control effects within the reactor unit itself. Part of the acetic acid inflow controlled by XV(3) is sent to the vaporizer and another part to the absorber. Any attack on this feed will be buffered by the acetic acid holdup in the tank. Additionally, ethylene inflow (XV(2)) controls the pressure in the absorber, not the gas recycle loop. Manipulating this control loop will affect both the reactor and refinement sections.

Safety-critical sensors have alarms or interlocks set at certain operating ranges. Exact values can be found in operator screens, controller logic, and one-line diagrams. The basic process layout can be understood from the flow diagram (Figure 4.1).

#### 6.3 Control

At this stage, the attacker explores the dynamic responses of the process to various manipulations. Digital controllers are typically designed based on process models, and their designs begin with the specification of desired closed-loop properties. The more proprietary information the attacker can gather on process dynamics and controller tuning, the more accurately she can identify the system.

Understanding the factors that influence dynamic process behavior is fundamental to process control analysis. Controllers are designed and tuned for specific operational ranges and may lose effectiveness under different conditions. For example, the dynamic behavior of a process heated from 140 to 150 degrees differs from when it is heated to 160 degrees. If the process was never expected to reach 160 degrees, the control algorithm may not have been tested for that range.

For two control loops to operate successfully in tandem, each must "know" what the other is doing. Otherwise, they may act against each other, a phenomenon known as loop interaction. Without knowing the exact plant configuration, it is not always possible to determine whether a process response is due to a fundamental property or a specific attack parameter.

In this work, we consider two types of attacks:
- **Steady State Attacks (SSA)**: Step-like attacks that bring the process to a new state and leave it there (Figure 6.1a).
- **Periodic Attacks (PA)**: Recurring attacks interleaved with process recovery phases (Figure 6.1b).

**Figure 6.1: Types of Attacks on Process Behavior**
- (a) Steady State Attack
- (b) Periodic Attack

The control phase involves mapping the dependencies between each actuator and downstream measurements. This can be done through detailed modeling or observations on the process itself. The attacker can make small changes and observe their propagation through the sensors.

We applied the following strategy to discover dynamic process behavior:
1. Identify steady-state MV values.
2. Increase or decrease MV by approximately 1% for 30 seconds and observe the process response.
3. Depending on the response, increase the magnitude and duration of the manipulation and monitor process variables for reaching operational or safety constraints.

**Steady State Attacks (SSA)**: Not all actuators are suitable for steady state attacks. XMV{4;5} move the process to its operational or safety constraints within a short time, even with slight manipulation.

**Periodic Attacks (PA)**: This scenario can be seen as pulse-width modulation of a steady state attack. Examining the sensitivity of control loops to periodic attacks is challenging due to the large number of attack parameters. Initially, we looked at attacks directly setting the position of the valve during the recovery phase. However, this strategy was unsuccessful for most control loops, resulting in critical process variables drifting towards their constraints. Therefore, we decided to let the controllers handle the process recovery phase.

One challenge was control loop ringing while manipulating XMV(5), which controls the vaporizer exit flow. Ringing, caused by negative real controller poles, increases wear and tear and can cause system instability. Reducing the inflow of reactants decreases VAC production. To overcome this, we slightly increased the flow for 1-2 minutes and allowed the process to recover for 2 minutes or longer. In the recovery phase, the controller decreased the flow to bring the CV to the set point, achieving a reduced flow over time. Overall, three control loops in the reactor unit can become unstable under certain attack parameters: XMV{2;4;5}.

**Outcome of the Control Stage**

We exhaustively tested all control loops for their sensitivity to a large number of attack settings. We categorized the controlled loops based on their sensitivity to the magnitude of manipulation (MM) and required recovery time (RT). Table 6.1 summarizes our analysis.

**Table 6.1: Sensitivity of Control Loops**
- **High Sensitivity**: XMV{1;5;7} (MM), XMV{4;7} (RT)
- **Medium Sensitivity**: XMV{2;4;6} (MM), XMV{5} (RT)
- **Low Sensitivity**: XMV{3} (MM), XMV{1;2;3;6} (RT)

We also analyzed alarm activation in response to control loop manipulations (Table 6.2).

**Table 6.2: Activation of Alarms**
- **Gas Loop O2**: XMV{1}
- **Reactor Feed T**: XMV{6}
- **Reactor T**: XMV{7}
- **FEHE Effluent**: XMV{7}
- **Gas Loop P**: XMV{2;3;6}

### 6.4 Damage

In the previous stage, we evaluated the potential to control the process. In the damage phase, the attacker tests these controls to achieve the desired damage. This stage is similar to a HAZOP analysis, where the attacker considers the consequences of specific actions, such as closing a valve.

The attacker must choose one or more attack scenarios for the final payload. This choice can be arbitrary, but given the effort required for a real attack, a metric to measure success is likely. For an economic attack, a plausible metric would be the amount of monetary loss to the victim.

#### Technician vs. Engineering Answer

The target plant may not have been designed in a hacker-friendly way and may not measure all necessary variables. The attacker must navigate these limitations to achieve the desired outcome.
