 **I'm submitting a ...** (check one with "x")
    [x] bug report
    [ ] feature request
    [ ] support request 
**Current behavior**  
When a `` is bound with `[ngModel])` the binding is not refreshed when
the options are reloaded as can happen when the options are loaded from the
server asynchronously.
In the repro provided below, given this HTML template,
        State:
          {{state}}
the state selection for the address "Chicaco, Illinois" is shown as
"California" rather than "Illinois"
**Expected behavior**  
Should be "Illinois" as shown in the workaround
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
