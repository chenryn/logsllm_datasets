**Current Behavior**
When a `<select>` element is bound with `[ngModel]`, the binding does not refresh when the options are reloaded, which can occur when the options are loaded from the server asynchronously. In the provided reproduction example, the state selection for the address "Chicago, Illinois" is incorrectly displayed as "California" instead of "Illinois".

**Expected Behavior**
The state selection should correctly display "Illinois" as shown in the workaround.
