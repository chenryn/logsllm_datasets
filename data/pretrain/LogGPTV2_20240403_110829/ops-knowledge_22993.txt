User: Please give a list of security detections for web applications and explain the meaning of each detection item.
Assistant: The following is a security detection list for web applications: 1. Injection attack detection: check whether there are SQL, OS, LDAP and other injection problems in the application, and whether it is capable of reflection, storage and DOM injection attacks. 2. CSRF defense detection: Check whether the application correctly implements the CSRF defense measures and whether it can transmit malicious requests from the user terminal. 3. XSS detection: Determine whether there are vulnerabilities that can execute malicious code, including reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities. 4. Permission control detection: Check all key operations in the application to see if the restrictions on access control policies are implemented correctly. 5. Session management detection: Test the security of the application in terms of user session management, including vulnerabilities, changing passwords, operating sessions, cookie security, etc. 6. Information leakage detection: Find any sensitive information leakage problems in the application, including source code, configuration information and user data, etc. 7. Encryption detection: Check whether there are problems using insecure keys or encryption algorithms in the application. 8. File upload detection: Check whether the application can upload malicious or virus files during the file upload process, and whether the file type filter and size limiter that should exist are set. 9. Logging and Monitoring Detection: Verify that the application is properly logging and monitoring all actions and events, and that there is sufficient availability to troubleshoot problems and respond to events. 10. Code execution detection: Detect whether the application is subject to code execution-based attacks, such as remote code execution, file inclusion and other vulnerabilities. Explanation: 1. Injection attack detection: Injection attack refers to an attack method in which an attacker can perform unauthorized operations in an application by constructing malicious input. If the application program has injection vulnerabilities, attackers can launch malicious operations or access sensitive database information through injection, bringing major security risks to the system. 2. CSRF defense detection: CSRF attack is a cross-site request forgery attack, in which attackers deceive users by performing operations in trusted sites that users have logged in. Detecting whether an application has CSRF protection can be an effective defense against such attacks. 3. XSS detection: XSS vulnerability is an attack method. The attacker can execute malicious scripts on the victim's browser, thereby performing unauthorized operations in the application or stealing sensitive user information. 4. Permission control detection: Through this detection item, you can determine whether the application explicitly restricts access to sensitive operations, and verify that this restriction is correctly enforced. 5. Session management detection: Session management vulnerabilities typically affect many sensitive operations and disrupt applications. If sessions are not properly secured, an attacker could use session hijacking to steal authentication data or perform programmatic actions. 6. Information leakage detection: If there is an information leakage problem in the application, the attacker can attack around the flaw in the performance of the application and use the information they get to conduct a deeper attack on the system. 7. Encryption Detection: If an application does not adequately encrypt sensitive data, it becomes an exploitable attack point for attackers, paving the way for hacking. 8. File upload detection: File upload vulnerability refers to an attack method in which an attacker invades an application by uploading a malicious file. Such attacks can be minimized by inspecting all file upload operations of the application. 9. Log and monitor detections: This is a critical part of responding to any type of attack or security incident. By logging and monitoring all actions and events, incidents can be detected, responded to, and responded to more quickly. 10. Code execution detection: If the application executes unsanitized user input, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute code and steal sensitive information in the application. Instrumenting all code execution inside the application can effectively avoid this.
