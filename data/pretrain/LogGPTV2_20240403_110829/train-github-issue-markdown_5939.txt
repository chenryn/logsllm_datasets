**Current behavior**  
I have an angular 2 app that gives a number of errors like the one below when
the app is build using angular cli 1.0
ERROR in C:/Source/xxx/MemberUI/src/$$_gendir/app/journal/journal-
component.ngfactory.ts (232,79): Supplied parameters do not match any
signature of call target.
Unfortunately, this is to little information for me to fix the bug and I am
unable to see the generated ngfactory file to learn more.
  * **Angular version:** 2.4.10
(unfortunately, the app does not work yet with 4.0.1)
  * **Language:** TS 2.1.5
  * **Node (for AoT issues):** `node --version` =  
7.7.1
