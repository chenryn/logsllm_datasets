### Current Behavior
I am encountering a series of errors, such as the one below, when building my Angular 2 application using Angular CLI 1.0:

```
ERROR in C:/Source/xxx/MemberUI/src/$$_gendir/app/journal/journal-component.ngfactory.ts (232,79): Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target.
```

Unfortunately, this error message does not provide enough information for me to diagnose and fix the issue. Additionally, I am unable to view the generated `ngfactory` file to gather more details.

### Environment Details
- **Angular Version:** 2.4.10 (The application does not work with version 4.0.1 yet)
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.1.5
- **Node Version (for AoT issues):** 7.7.1

### Additional Information
- The application is built using Angular CLI 1.0.
- The specific error occurs in the `journal-component.ngfactory.ts` file at line 232, column 79.
- I have tried to find more information about the error, but the lack of access to the `ngfactory` file hinders further investigation.

Thank you for your assistance.
