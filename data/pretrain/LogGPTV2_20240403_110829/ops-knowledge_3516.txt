User: How to perform automatic expansion and contraction in the cloud platform to cope with changing real-time loads?
Assistant: The following steps can be taken to perform automatic expansion and contraction on the cloud platform: 1. Set an automatic expansion and contraction strategy. According to the characteristics of the application and the historical load situation, set a set of reliable expansion and contraction strategies. A set of trigger conditions can be set, and when the conditions are met, the expansion and contraction operations will be automatically triggered. For example, when CPU usage reaches 80%, or memory usage reaches 90%, start a new set of instances. 2. Publish the dynamic load balancing service If you use the load balancing service, you can configure it to use automatic expansion and contraction. For example, AWS's Elastic Load Balancer supports automatic scaling and shrinking, which can automatically adjust the number of instances according to demand. 3. Using automated operation and maintenance tools Using automated operation and maintenance tools, such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet, can automate application deployment, configuration, and management. This reduces manual effort while ensuring application reliability and consistency. 4. Monitoring and logging Monitor application performance, error and exception logs in real time and record them accurately. This will help design better scaling strategies to cope with changing real-time loads. 5. Test and optimize Regularly test and optimize the automatic scaling strategy to ensure the reliability of the system. Large-scale load situations can be simulated in a non-production environment to evaluate the performance and optimization space of automatic scaling strategies.
