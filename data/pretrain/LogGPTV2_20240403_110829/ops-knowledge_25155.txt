User: I am writing a test application in python and to test some particular scenario, I need to launch my python child process in windows SYSTEM account.
I can do this by creating exe from my python script and then use that while creating windows service. But this option is not good for me because in future if I change anything in my python script then I have to regenerate exe every-time. 
If anybody have any better idea about how to do this then please let me know.

Assistant: Create a service that runs permanently. 
Arrange for the service to have an IPC communications channel. 
From your desktop python code, send messages to the service down that IPC channel. These messages specify the action to be taken by the service. 
The service receives the message and performs the action. That is, executes the python code that the sender requests. 

This allows you to decouple the service from the python code that it executes and so allows you to avoid repeatedly re-installing a service. 
If you don't want to run in a service then you can use CreateProcessAsUser or similar APIs.
