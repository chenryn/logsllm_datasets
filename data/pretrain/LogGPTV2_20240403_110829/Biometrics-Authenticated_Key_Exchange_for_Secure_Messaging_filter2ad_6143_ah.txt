# Biometric Vector Set Analysis and Fuzzy Asymmetric Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE)

## Performance Analysis

### Running Time and Communication Cost
The following table illustrates the running time and communication cost for different operations in Dec, as the size of the biometric vector set increases from 20 to 1000.

| Running Time (s) | Communication Cost (KB) |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| 14000            | 100000                  |
| 12000            | 10000                   |
| 10000            | 1000                    |
| 8000             | 100                     |
| 6000             | 10                      |
| 4000             | 1                       |
| 2000             |                         |
| 0                |                         |

### Instantiation of Fuzzy aPAKE
We instantiate fuzzy aPAKE-1 with the oblivious transfer protocol from [4] and fuzzy aPAKE-2 with OPAQUE [32]. The results are shown in Figure 13. 

- **Running Time:**
  - Fuzzy aPAKE-1 is more than 4000 times the cost of BAKE-1 and more than 2000 times the cost of BAKE-2.
  - Fuzzy aPAKE-2 is more than 5000 times the cost of BAKE-1 and more than 2000 times the cost of BAKE-2.

- **Communication Cost:**
  - Fuzzy aPAKE-1 is more than 50 times the cost of BAKE-1 and more than 230 times the cost of BAKE-2.
  - Fuzzy aPAKE-2 is more than 80 times the cost of BAKE-1 and more than 380 times the cost of BAKE-2.

Therefore, BAKE has a significant advantage over fuzzy aPAKE in terms of both computation and communication costs.

### Categories of AKE
According to whether the input secret is precise, we divide AKE into two categories: precise AKE and fuzzy AKE.

#### Precise AKE
In this category, the input secret must be exact, without any typos or noise. Common solutions include:
- **Password-based solutions** [5, 32, 49]
- **PKI-based solutions** [13, 45]
- **HB-type authentication protocols** [26, 30, 33], which rely on the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem.
- **Out-of-band authentication** [37, 42, 50], used in applications like WhatsApp [51].

However, these solutions are not suitable for biometric AKE because captured biometrics contain unpredictable noises. Additionally, many solutions require the two participants to share a secret, which violates data protection regulations when applied to biometrics.

#### Fuzzy AKE
In this category, the input secret may contain typos or noises. Solutions can be classified into symmetric and asymmetric types.

- **Symmetric Solutions:**
  - **Fuzzy extractor** [18]: Two similar biometric inputs can extract the same randomness from public information while hiding the biometric inputs.
  - **fPAKE** [19]: Solves key exchange from noisy low-entropy password strings but requires storing the password, which also violates data protection regulations.

- **Asymmetric Solutions:**
  - **Fuzzy asymmetric PAKE** [21]: Simultaneously considers asymmetric PAKE and fuzzy PAKE, providing constructions based on secret sharing and standard asymmetric PAKE. However, these constructions involve frequent interactions and are not suitable for asynchronous messaging scenarios.

In contrast, BAKE is designed for both fuzzy vectors and fuzzy sets, involving only one-round interaction and supporting both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.

## Conclusion

To facilitate secure messaging in social life, we propose a BAKE framework that supports both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios without storing any secrets, including biometric characteristics, in a terminal. We present a cryptographic primitive called AFEM, which allows only participants with similar biometric characteristics to obtain a message encapsulated with the corresponding public key. We provide two constructions for AFEM and initiate them with iris and fingerprint in our BAKE framework. Security analysis demonstrates that BAKE is secure, and experimental results show its practicality.
