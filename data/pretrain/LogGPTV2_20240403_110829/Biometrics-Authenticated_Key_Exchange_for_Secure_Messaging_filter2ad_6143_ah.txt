we instantiate fuzzy aPAKE-1 with the oblivious transfer protocol
from [4] and instantiate fuzzy aPAKE-2 with OPAQUE [32].
The results are shown in Figure 13. The running time of fuzzy
aPAKE-1 is more than 4000 times cost of BAKE-1, and more than
2000 times cost of BAKE-2. The running time of fuzzy aPAKE-2 is
more than 5000 times cost of BAKE-1, and more than 2000 times
cost of BAKE-2. The communication cost of fuzzy aPAKE-1 is more
than 50 times cost of BAKE-1, and more than 230 times cost of
BAKE-2. The communication cost of fuzzy aPAKE-2 is more than
80 times cost of BAKE-1, and more than 380 times cost of BAKE-
2. Therefore, BAKE has an overwhelming advantage over fuzzy
aPAKE in terms of both computation and communication costs.
7 RELATED WORK
According to whether the input secret is precise, we divide AKE
into two categories: precise AKE and fuzzy AKE.
Precise AKE. In this category, the input secret cannot con-
tain any typo or noise. The most common precise AKE includes
password-based solutions [5, 32, 49] and PKI-based solutions [13,
45]. For resource-constrained devices, HB-type authentication pro-
tocols [26, 30, 33] were proposed, whose security mainly relies on
the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem. In practice, many
messaging applications (e.g., WhatsApp [51]) enable out-of-band
authentication, assuming that users have access to an external
channel, such as Short Authenticated Strings (SAS) [37, 42, 50]. Un-
fortunately, these solutions cannot apply to biometric AKE since the
captured biometrics (i.e., the input secret) contains unpredictable
noises. Moreover, many solutions (e.g., HB-type protocols and SAS-
based solutions) require the two participants to share a secret, which
violates data protection regulations when applied to biometrics.
Fuzzy AKE. In this category, the input secret may contain typos
or noises when fed into cryptographic algorithms. Existing solu-
tions can be classified into two types: symmetric and asymmetric.
In the symmetric solutions, the two communicating participants
possess the same secrets to authenticate each other and negotiate
a session key. Fuzzy extractor is a typical solution introduced by
Dodis et al. [18]. In their solution, two similar biometric inputs can
be used to extract the same randomness from public information
while hiding these biometric inputs. Afterward, various fuzzy ex-
tractor variants emerged [9–11], and multi-factor AKE protocols
were constructed based on the fuzzy extractor [38, 39]. However,

cost.
these solutions need to store the (secret) randomness on the other
participant, which may be exploited by an adversary. Another rep-
resentative symmetric solution is presented by Dupont et al. [19],
called fuzzy Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (fPAKE), which
solved the problem of key exchange from noisy low-entropy pass-
word strings. However, their solutions need the other participant to
store the password, which also violates data protection regulations
when applied to biometrics.
As required in General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), bio-
metric characteristics should be protected against disclosure. For
this goal, the study on asymmetric solutions, in which a participant
has no access to the biometric characteristics of other participants,
attracts the attention of researchers. To the best of our knowledge,
the only suitable asymmetric solutions are the fuzzy asymmetric
PAKE protocols proposed by Erwig et al. [21]. They considered
asymmetric PAKE and fuzzy PAKE simultaneously, and gave two
constructions based on secret sharing and standard asymmetric
PAKE, respectively. However, this primitive is only proposed for
fuzzy vectors (e.g., password). Moreover, their constructions involve
frequent interactions and are not suitable for asynchronous messag-
ing scenarios. In contrast, BAKE is designed for both fuzzy vectors
and fuzzy sets, and our constructions involve only one-round inter-
action and support both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.
8 CONCLUSION
To facilitate secure messaging in social life, we propose a BAKE
framework that supports both synchronous and asynchronous sce-
narios and does no need to store any secret, including biometric
characteristics, in a terminal. We present a cryptographic primitive
called AFEM to enable only the participant with similar biometric
characteristics to obtain a message that is encapsulated with the
corresponding public key. We also give two constructions for AFEM
and initiates them with the iris and fingerprint in our BAKE frame-
work. The security analysis demonstrates that BAKE is secure and
the experimental results show the practicality of BAKE.
