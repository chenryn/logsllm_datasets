User: How do i change directory to the directory with my python script in? So far I figured out I should use os.chdir and sys.argv[0]. I'm sure there is a better way then to write my own function to parse argv[0].
Assistant: os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))) should do it. 
os.chdir(os.path.dirname(__file__)) would not work if the script is run from the directory in which it is present.
