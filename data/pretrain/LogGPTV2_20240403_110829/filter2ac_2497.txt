titleblackhat:eu-21 The Black Hat Europe NOC Report
After a short intermission, the Black Hat NOC team is back with what's sure to be a year like no other. With the world going virtual, and Black Hat being no exception, come find out how we've spent the last two years changing, adapting, and preparing for an event that's both in person, and broadcast to the world. We'll share what we're using to stabilize and secure one of the most notorious networks in the world, what worked, what didn't, and all the shenanigans in between. The stakes are high, the outcomes are unknown, and we're going to learn a lesson one way or another.
