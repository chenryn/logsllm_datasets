**ATT&CK ID:** T1557.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay

**Description:**
Adversaries can exploit the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) protocols by responding to network traffic and impersonating an authoritative name resolution source. This technique, known as LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning, forces a target system to communicate with an adversary-controlled system. The primary goal of this activity is to collect or relay authentication materials, such as usernames and passwords, which can be used for further malicious activities.

**Key Points:**
- **Protocol Exploitation:** Adversaries leverage LLMNR and NBT-NS, which are typically used for name resolution in local networks.
- **Spoofing:** By spoofing an authoritative name resolution source, adversaries can redirect traffic to their controlled systems.
- **Credential Collection:** The technique is often used to intercept and collect authentication credentials, facilitating unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.

This method is a common tactic in various cyber-attacks, particularly those aimed at gaining deeper access to a network and exfiltrating sensitive information.
