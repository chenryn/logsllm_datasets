vertised by 6 of the 14 merchants we identify.1 We poll this
data on a weekly basis from July, 2013 until the conclusion
of our study in April, 2014. We rely on this historical pric-
ing data to understand the stability of the PVA marketplace
and to understand how price correlates with adaptations in
phone veriﬁcation techniques. When available, we also track
the prices of Facebook and Twitter PVA accounts which we
use to understand the burden imposed by phone veriﬁcation
as a general technique.
3.1.2 Account Pricing
Prices for the accounts we purchase in July, 2013 range
from $85 per 1K at the lowest and $500 at the highest, as
detailed in Table 1. We provide a breakdown of the his-
torical prices these and other merchants charge throughout
our study in Figure 1, with prices over $250 omitted for
clarity. Prices in this upper bracket were $250, $300, $350,
$500, and $600 per 1K accounts. These prices never changed
throughout our monitoring.
Despite a large pool of competing storefronts, we ﬁnd no
evidence of merchants attempting to undercut one another
by lowering prices. Instead, the cost of Google PVA remain
ﬁxed throughout our study, with the exception of a single
1Other merchants rely on email or Skype conversations to
determine up-to-date pricing which precludes passive moni-
toring.

market-wide drop lasting November, 2013–February, 2014.
During this period, almost all of the merchants we tracked
(with the exception of those in the upper bracket) lowered
their pricing by 30–40% before returning to their previous
rate. The correlated behavior of merchants leads us to be-
lieve that many storefronts are merely resellers for the same
miscreant in a similar fashion to spam aﬃliate programs [14].
3.1.3 Cost of Phone Veriﬁcation
The primary goal of phone veriﬁcation is to throttle the
rate miscreants can register fraudulent accounts, and as a
byproduct, increase the cost of credentials. While we can-
not determine the fees that merchants pay to acquire fresh
phone numbers, we can measure how merchants pass these
costs on to blackmarket consumers. Of the merchants we
track, three simultaneously advertised non-PVA and PVA
equivalents for Google as well as Facebook, while one mer-
chant advertised access to Twitter non-PVA and PVA. (We
were unable to ﬁnd merchants advertising both LinkedIn or
Craigslist PVA and non-PVA.) We use these merchants to
measure the price increase imposed by phone veriﬁcation.
Assuming that merchants rely on the same infrastructure
to register PVA and non-PVA, this allows us to isolate the
impact of phone veriﬁcation from variable merchant sophis-
tication and registration safeguards across services.
Table 2 shows the relative price increase underground mer-
chants charge for phone veriﬁcation. While the base price
of accounts are wildly diﬀerent between merchants, this in-
crease is relatively ﬁxed: 1.25x–6.25x for Google and 2–5x
for Facebook. The 25x increase for Twitter is likely a re-
sult of merchants not yet adapting to phone veriﬁcation on
the service, with PVA accounts emerging only at the end
of March, 2014 (a month before our study concluded). We
observed a similar drastic price diﬀerence with the initial
release of Google PVA in 2012, where prices were 17x their
non-PVA equivalent. We note that a direct comparison be-
tween PVA multipliers is diﬃcult due to varying service-level
policies on the number of accounts that can be associated
with a single phone or whether certain phone numbers are
prohibited as veriﬁcation endpoints.
We caution there is no indication whether blackmarket
consumers are willing to bare the fees charged by account
merchants. Equally opaque is whether the price diﬀeren-
tial between non-PVA and PVA accounts is grounded in the
scarcity of phone numbers, demand, or consumer naivety.
Consequently, we explore the relation between phone veriﬁ-
cation techniques and market price, particularly during the
market-wide price reduction, further in Section 4.
Stockpiling
3.1.4
The freshness of accounts is an important metric for
whether merchants conduct real-time bulk registrations or
instead rely on outdated stockpiles. We measure the age
of the 2,217 accounts we purchase as the delta between the
time we order accounts versus the time merchants registered
the accounts. Accounts range in age from 1–164 days, with
an average age of roughly 27 days. Our results indicate
that merchants are not reliant on old stockpiles, but in-
stead have access to recently registered accounts. Paired
with stable pricing throughout our analysis, this suggests
that merchants have a regular supply of phone numbers at
their disposal.
3.1.5 Disable Rate
Inactive accounts that merchants stockpile are not im-
mune to abuse detection. We measure the volume of ac-
counts per merchant that Google disables (independent of
our purchasing and analysis), shown in Table 1. Overall,
Google disables roughly 68% of the accounts we acquire
within one month of their purchase. We ﬁnd that cheaper
accounts are more frequently correlated with being caught
and deactivated by Google, indicating that price may have
some bearing on the eﬀort account merchants put into bulk
registering accounts (e.g. limiting the reuse of infrastructure
to avoid clustering). For the purposes of our study, the high
recall rate allows us to rely on sampling abusive accounts
disabled by Google without risk of omitting a large mar-
ket segment of PVA abuse. We note however that without
regular repurchases, we cannot guarantee the detection rate
remains stable throughout our analysis.
3.2 Abusive Accounts
The bulk of our analysis relies on a retroactive random
sample of 300,000 Google PVA created and disabled for
spam and abuse between July, 2013–April, 2014. No ac-
count information ever leaves Google datacenters or is ac-
cessed in non-aggregate form by external researchers. For
each of these accounts (as well as our purchased account
dataset), we have access to the registration IP, registration
phone number, and other signals tied to the registration
process. We note that due to potential delays in abuse de-
tection, we may underestimate the volume of abuse towards
the tail end of our collection period. We consider this lim-
itation whenever we discuss trends in the volume of abuse
over time or changes in registration behaviors.
4. ANALYZING ABUSIVE ACCOUNTS
A fundamental question of our investigation is the sus-
tainability of phone veriﬁcation as a defense against bulk
account creation. We ﬁnd evidence that phone veriﬁed abuse
is a persistent threat. To dissect this problem, we analyze
the origin of abusive number and techniques miscreants use
to maximize the value they garner from a single phone num-
ber. We relate these technical measurements that capture
the complexity of creating phone veriﬁed accounts to the
prices merchants charge. Finally, we analyze the eﬀective-
ness of other registration safeguards including IP reputation,
CAPTCHAs, and secondary email addresses.
4.1 Origin of Abusive Phone Numbers
We examine multiple facets tied to the origin of phone
numbers including the country of origin, the carrier provid-
ing service, and whether fraudulent accounts are registered
with collocated IPs and phone numbers. We acquire these
phone signals from an MSISDN2 database used by Google
to map phone numbers to carrier data (including whether
the number is VOIP). We note that similar databases are
publicly available, though typically for some fee.
4.1.1 Breakdown by Country
We examine the country code of each phone number as-
sociated with our abusive and purchased accounts to cap-
ture which regions serve as the most popular veriﬁcation
endpoints. We ﬁnd that the United States is the single
largest origin of phone numbers, accounting for 27% of abu-
sive PVA in our dataset. This is followed in popularity by
India (22%), Indonesia (12%), Nigeria (4%), South Africa
(4%), and Bangladesh (4%), with other regions accounting
for 28% of abuse. We note that receiving an SMS in all of
these top countries other than the United States is free.
Bulk access to phone numbers in these regions appears to
be a variable process. Figure 2 shows a weekly breakdown
of the top six countries serving as veriﬁcation endpoints
throughout our study. Phones from India, while prevalent
at the onset of our measurement (contributing nearly 40% of
new PVA), has fallen oﬀ in favor of Indonesia. In contrast,
phones from the United States dominate 60% of new PVA
registrations from October–February. This period overlaps
with the drastic price reduction we observe from November–
February, a phenomenon we explore further in the next sec-
tion.
For the accounts we purchased at the onset of our study,
97% were veriﬁed with phone numbers from the United
States while 3% were associated with numbers from Ukraine.
We ﬁnd that only one of the 7 merchants we solicit rely on
non-US numbers.
If we examine pricing based on the re-
gion that phones numbers originate from, merchants appear
to charge arbitrarily for accounts veriﬁed with US numbers.
Such accounts range $85–300 per 1K accounts, while the sole
merchant verifying accounts from Ukraine charged $500 per
1K. Our ﬁndings indicate that the origin of phone numbers
alone cannot explain the cost of an account or why certain
merchants are more likely to have their stockpiles disabled.
4.1.2 Breakdown by Carrier
We further subdivide countries based on the abused car-
riers operating in each region, the results of which we show
in Table 3. Bandwidth.com—a VOIP provider in the US
tied to multiple free telephony services including Pinger and
Google Voice [3]—represents the single largest gateway for
abuse. This is followed in popularity by a multitude of mo-
bile carriers predominantly operating out of India and In-
donesia. We evaluate each of these veriﬁcation approaches
separately.
VOIP Abuse: VOIP in particular poses a signiﬁcant threat
to the intended cost of phone veriﬁcation. Services such as
Pinger [18] and TextPlus [24] allow new customers to regis-
ter for a free, SMS-receivable number in exchange for solving
a CAPTCHA or email veriﬁcation challenge. Such resources

a phone number which is associated with a SIM card.

lar origins of numbers are the United States (US), India
(IN), Indonesia (ID), Nigeria (NG), South Africa (ZA), and

are cheaply available from the underground as we previously
discussed in Section 2. Similarly, services such as Google
Voice allow miscreants to convert an existing phone num-
ber (including US VOIP numbers) into multiple new phone
numbers. This creates an abuse multiplier that allows mis-
creants to amortize the cost of the original phone number
seed as well as mask the original carrier. All of these services
are available online, opening up the possibility for miscre-
ants to scrape page content to automate SMS veriﬁcation
challenges. In total, 24% of all abusive PVA in our dataset
were veriﬁed with VOIP numbers.
The merchants we solicit readily exploit cheap VOIP num-
bers to circumvent the intended cost of phone veriﬁcation.
Of the accounts we purchased, 97% were veriﬁed via num-
bers tied to a mixture of VOIP providers including Band-
width.com, Level 3, and Telengy. This trend is also repre-
sented in Figure 2 where 94% of all US numbers used to
verify accounts between October–January were VOIP. The
decrease in US phone numbers after January is the result
of Google penalizing new registrations tied to frequently
abused US VOIP providers. This conﬂuence of events cor-
relates with the 30–40% price drop in accounts that we ob-
serve from November–February after which prices returned
to their normal levels. While we cannot provide deﬁnitive
proof, our results suggest that market prices can serve as an
indicator of the underlying performance of abuse safeguards.
Mobile carriers: VOIP numbers alone do not explain the
entire phone veriﬁed abuse ecosystem; a second substantial
component is fueled by mobile carriers tied to India and
Indonesia including PT, Bharti, and Vodafone. Our un-
derstanding of how miscreants acquire phone numbers from
these regions and subsequently respond to SMS challenges is
less clear than VOIP. Anecdotally, when we conducted our
search to identify merchants selling PVA, we also encoun-
tered an underground market segment surrounding veriﬁca-
tion as a service. Sites such as http://sms-area.org adver-
tise automated APIs for phone verifying Vkontakte, Google,
and Facebook accounts. Prices for these services are as low
