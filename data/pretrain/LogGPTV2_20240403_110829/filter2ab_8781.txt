**Title: Botconf 2019 - DFIR & Crisis Management: Post-Mortems and Lessons Learned from the Field**

**Abstract:**

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive summary of both the successes and failures in crisis management, drawing on our extensive field experience. We will explore various phases of a crisis, supported by real-life examples, including:

- A scenario where a CISO and a CIO were convinced that one of their team members was colluding with an adversary.
- An incident where an "AD dump" found on a threat actor's server mobilized over 300 people, only to be later identified as a false positive.
- A classic threat hunting operation that escalated into a full incident response after the discovery of Conficker, nine years after its initial emergence.

These and other case studies will highlight key lessons learned and best practices for effective crisis management and digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).
