User: If I build a package with python setup.py bdist_wheel, the resulting package expands the shebangs in the scripts listed in setup.py via setup(scripts=["script/path"]) to use the absolute path to my python executable #!/home/f483/dev/storj/storjnode/env/bin/python.
This is obviously a problem as anyone using the wheel will not have that setup. It does not seem to make a difference what kind of shebang I am using.
Assistant: I finally narrowed it down and found the problem.
Here the exact steps to reproduce the problem and the solution.

Use a valid shebang in a script thats added in setup.py. In my case #!/usr/bin/env python
Create a virtualenv with virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2 env and activate with source env/bin/activate.
Install the package with python setup.py install to the virtualenv.
Build the wheel with python setup.py bdist_wheel.

The problem is installing the package to the virtualenv in step 3. If this is not done the shebang is not expanded.
