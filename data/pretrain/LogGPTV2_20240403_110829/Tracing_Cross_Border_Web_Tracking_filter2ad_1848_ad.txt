GDPR. The data collected in the above time period are not included
in the data analysis in Sect. 4.
Our daily snapshots consist of 24 hour NetFlow [32] data col-
lected at both network edges, internal (e.g., end-users) as well as
external (i.e., peering links). The NetFlow data provides per flow
the collection timestamp, exporting router and interface identifiers,
the layer-4 transport protocol, the source and destination IPs and
protocol ports, the IP type of service field as well as sampled num-
ber of packets and bytes. The NetfFlow sampling rate is constant
throughout the experiment. For our study, we consider only the
router interfaces that carry user traffic, i.e., internal network edge
routers. All the ISPs perform ingress network filtering (BCP38 and
RFC2827 [33]) against spoofing. We noticed that the majority of the
flows (more than 99.5%) that involve tracking IPs are Web traffic
in ports 80 or 443, using either TCP or UDP (due to the increasing
usage of QUIC [40, 54]) protocols. Overall, more than 83% of the
traffic used port 443, thus, it was encrypted.
Ethical considerations: To protect the privacy of users, the IPs
of the end users in the Netflow data are anonymized, i.e., replaced
with the country code where each ISP operates. We do not collect,
store, or process any information regarding the users. For our study,
individual user IPs and activity are not important considering we
know that the users are located in the country that the ISP operates.
To report on the number of flows that involve the tracking IPs, we
use a hash function to check if the source or the destination of
the flow matches any tracking IP. If it matches, we increase the
counter for this tracking IP by one. For our analysis we follow the
methodology described in Sect. 4 to infer border crossing.
7.3 Results
We now turn our attention to the assessment of the confinement of
tracking flows within EU GDPR (EU28) and national borders. For a
summary of results, we refer to Table 8. Notice that the sampled
tracking flows are in the order of multiple millions, but the estimated
number of tracking flows is several orders of magnitude larger. For
example, the estimated number of tracking flows for DE-Broadband
on April 4, 2018 is more than 1 Trillion flows. This highlights the
large number of flows that are dedicated to tracking, which accounts
for, in the case of DE-Broadband, around 3% of the total flows in
this ISP. It is also worth mentioning that the number of tracking
flows in mobile operators, e.g., DE-Mobile, is relatively lower. This
happens because Web activity in mobile is lower than in fixed, since
much of the traffic goes over smartphone apps instead of browsers.
Baseline results: Overall, the analysis of the four large European
ISPs shows comparable confinement ratios as those reported based
on browser extension data. Indeed, the analysis of tracking flows
observed by 183 users in EU28 countries over a period of four
months (see Sect. 4) and the post GDPR period between mid-Jan.-
July 2018 showed that around 85% of the tracking flows terminated
within EU28 borders. As shown in Table 8, the confinement of
tracking flows within EU28 as observed from more than 60 million
European users in three EU28 countries for the same period ranges
from 76% to 93%, which is in pretty good agreement with the results
of Fig. 7(b) derived based on browser extension data. When focusing
on the difference across time, we observe that the confinement of
tracking flows within EU28 has not changed dramatically in the
last six months, and it has been high throughout this period as
well as before the EU GDPR implementation date (May 25, 2018).
Similar observations apply for June 20, 2018 after the EU GDPR
implementation date. This is an indication that many companies in
the ad and tracking space took measures to confine tracking flows
within EU28 borders according to GDPR law.
The effect of provider type: When comparing the confinement
across networks, there are some noticeable differences. The ISPs
that are primarily mobile operators, namely DE-Mobile and HU,
yield higher confinement (above 90%). This is to be expected as
mobile users typically rely on the DNS service of their provider,
and, thus get mapped to nearby tracking servers more frequently, if
available. On the other hand, broadband users increasingly rely on
third-party DNS services [46], e.g., Google DNS, Quad9, Level3, etc.,
