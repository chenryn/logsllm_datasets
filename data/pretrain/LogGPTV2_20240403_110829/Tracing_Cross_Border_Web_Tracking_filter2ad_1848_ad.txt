### Data Collection and Analysis
The data collected in the specified time period is not included in the analysis presented in Section 4. Our daily snapshots consist of 24-hour NetFlow [32] data collected at both internal (e.g., end-users) and external (i.e., peering links) network edges. The NetFlow data includes:
- Collection timestamp
- Exporting router and interface identifiers
- Layer-4 transport protocol
- Source and destination IPs and protocol ports
- IP type of service field
- Sampled number of packets and bytes

The NetFlow sampling rate is constant throughout the experiment. We consider only the router interfaces that carry user traffic, i.e., internal network edge routers. All ISPs perform ingress network filtering (BCP38 and RFC2827 [33]) against spoofing. The majority of flows (more than 99.5%) involving tracking IPs are web traffic on ports 80 or 443, using TCP or UDP (due to the increasing usage of QUIC [40, 54]). Over 83% of the traffic uses port 443, indicating it is encrypted.

### Ethical Considerations
To protect user privacy, the IPs of end users in the NetFlow data are anonymized and replaced with the country code where each ISP operates. We do not collect, store, or process any information regarding individual users. For our study, individual user IPs and activity are not important as we know the users are located in the country where the ISP operates. To report the number of flows involving tracking IPs, we use a hash function to check if the source or destination of the flow matches any tracking IP. If it matches, we increment the counter for that tracking IP.

### Results
We now assess the confinement of tracking flows within EU GDPR (EU28) and national borders. The sampled tracking flows are in the order of multiple millions, but the estimated number of tracking flows is several orders of magnitude larger. For example, the estimated number of tracking flows for DE-Broadband on April 4, 2018, is more than 1 trillion flows, accounting for about 3% of the total flows in this ISP. The number of tracking flows in mobile operators, such as DE-Mobile, is relatively lower due to lower web activity in mobile compared to fixed networks, as much of the traffic goes over smartphone apps instead of browsers.

#### Baseline Results
The analysis of four large European ISPs shows comparable confinement ratios to those reported based on browser extension data. The analysis of tracking flows observed by 183 users in EU28 countries over four months (see Section 4) and the post-GDPR period between mid-January and July 2018 showed that around 85% of the tracking flows terminated within EU28 borders. As shown in Table 8, the confinement of tracking flows within EU28, as observed from more than 60 million European users in three EU28 countries for the same period, ranges from 76% to 93%, which aligns well with the results in Fig. 7(b) derived from browser extension data. The confinement of tracking flows within EU28 has not changed dramatically in the last six months and has been high throughout this period, even before the EU GDPR implementation date (May 25, 2018).

#### Effect of Provider Type
When comparing the confinement across networks, there are noticeable differences. ISPs that are primarily mobile operators, namely DE-Mobile and HU, show higher confinement (above 90%). This is expected as mobile users typically rely on the DNS service of their provider and are mapped to nearby tracking servers more frequently, if available. Broadband users, however, increasingly rely on third-party DNS services (e.g., Google DNS, Quad9, Level3, etc.), leading to lower confinement rates.
