ABSTRACT 
The  workshop  on  “attacks  and  solutions  in  hardware 
security” (ASHES) deals with all aspects of hardware security, 
including any recent attacks and solutions in the area.  Besides 
mainstream  research  in  hardware  security,  it  also  covers  new, 
alternative  or  emerging  application  scenarios,  such  as  the 
internet  of  things,  nuclear  weapons 
inspections,  satellite 
security,  or  consumer  and  supply  chain  security.    It  also  puts 
some 
special  purpose  hardware  and  novel 
methodological solutions, such as particularly lightweight, small, 
low-cost,  and  energy-efficient  devices,  or  even  non-electronic 
security  systems.    Finally,  ASHES  welcomes  any  theoretical 
works  that  systematize  and  structure  the  area,  and  so-called 
“Wild-and-Crazy”  papers  that  describe  and  distribute  seminal 
ideas at an early conceptual stage to the community.

1  INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 
As predicted by Gartner in 2015, there will be around 21 billion 
hardware  devices  connected  in  the  IoT  by  2020,  creating  a 
spending of about 3,000 billion dollars per year.  This makes the 
IoT  and  associated  hardware  security  questions  clearly  one  of 
the most massive and impactful endeavors of this century.   
At  the  same  time,  the  development  of  suitable  hardware 
strategies  seems  to  lag  behind  the  actual  spread  of  the  IoT.

While the security community has long recognized that many of 
the established, classical recipes do not transfer easily (or not at 
all) to hardware in an IoT-setting, no fully convincing substitute 
strategies have been developed yet.  This leads to a host of novel 
questions,  which  cannot  be  addressed  by  existing  means  and 
methods  alone.    One  particular  scientific  challenge  lies  in  the 
unprecedented  threat  landscape  of  the  IoT,  which  will  connect 
billions  of  pervasive,  low-cost  devices  with  no  strong  tamper-
protection  or  even  computational 
resources  on  board. 
Particularly pressing questions in this context include: 
  How  can  we  get  individual  cryptographic  keys  into 
billions of low-cost hardware devices? 
  How can we securely identify low-cost hardware over 
digital  channels,  e.g.,  systems  without  digital  signal 
processors  or  devices  merely  powered  by  scavenged 
energy? 
  How  can  we  protect  against  tampering  and  side-
channels in low-cost hardware?  
  How  can  we  remotely  verify  the  functionality  and 
integrity of connected IoT-devices? 
  How can we establish the long-term confidentiality of 
communications with resource-constrained hardware? 
  How can we protect the IoT and its hardware against 
malware  (viruses,  Trojan  horses,  etc.)  and  network 
attacks? 
  How  can  we  enable  secure  physical  data  storage  in 
lightweight hardware systems? 
  How can we preserve the privacy of users in pervasive 
IoT-scenarios? 
The purpose of this workshop is to foster solutions for these and 
other impending issues on hardware security, in particular with 
hindsight to new methods and application scenarios such as the 
IoT.    It  shall  provide  the  CCS-community  with  a  dedicated, 
specialized forum for this type of research.  It is thereby meant 
not  only  to  cover  mainstream  hardware  security  research,  but 
also  to  support  novel  research  and  methods  at  an  early  stage, 
fostering innovation in the area.

2  TOPICS 
ASHES deals  with  the  entire  range  of  established,  mainstream 
hardware security research, but particularly tries to foster novel 
and  innovative  approaches,  as  well  as  emerging  application 
areas.  
This includes, but is not limited to: 
  Tamper sensing and tamper protection 
Physical  attacks  (fault  injection,  side-channels,  etc.), 
including new attack vectors or attack methods 
  Biometrics and hardware security 
Physical  unclonable  functions  (and  new/emerging 
variants thereof) 
  Device fingerprinting and hardware forensics 
Item tagging, secure supply chains and product piracy 
  Use  of  emerging  computing  technologies  in  security 
(including quantum techniques) 
and

3  PAPER CATEGORIES  
To  account  for  the  special  scope  of  the  workshop,  and  for  the 
particular  nature  of  hardware  security  as  a  rapidly  developing 
discipline,  the  workshop  offers  four  different  categories  of 
papers: 
format 
(including 
references 
Full  papers,  with  up  to  10  pages  in  ACM  double 
column 
and 
appendices),  and  a  25  min  presentation  timeslot  at 
the workshop (including questions). 
Short  papers,  with  up  to  6  pages  in  ACM  double 
column 
and 
appendices),  and  a  15  min  presentation  timeslot  at 
the workshop (including questions). 
references 
(including 
format 
timeslot  at 
  Wild and Crazy (WaC) papers, with 3 to 6 pages 
in  ACM  double  column  format,  with  additional 
appendices and references of up to 6 pages, and 15 
min  presentation 
the  workshop 
(including  questions).  WaC  papers  are  meant  to 
target groundbreaking new methods and paradigms 
for  hardware  security.  Their  focus  lies  on  novelty 
and potential impact, and on the plausibility of their 
argumentation,  but  not  on  a  full  demonstration  or 
complete  implementation  of  their  ideas.  They  are 
reviewed  and  assessed  as  such.  Wild  and  crazy 
papers  must  bear  the  prefix  “WaC:”  in  their  title 
from the submission onwards. 
Systematization  of  Knowledge  (SoK)  papers, 
with up to 12 pages in ACM double column format 
(including appendices and references), and a 25 min 
presentation  timeslot  at  the  workshop  (including 
questions).  SoK  papers  shall  evaluate,  systematize, 
and  contextualize  existing  knowledge.  They  should 
serve  the  community  by  fostering  and  structuring 
the  development  of  a  particular  subarea  within 
hardware security. Ideally, but not necessarily, they 
might  provide  a  new  viewpoint  on  an  established, 
important  subarea,  support  or  challenge 
long-
standing  beliefs  with  compelling  evidence,  or 
present  a  convincing  new  taxonomy.  They  will  be 
reviewed  and  assessed  as  such.  Systematization  of 
knowledge papers must bear the prefix “SoK:” in the 
title from the submission onwards.
