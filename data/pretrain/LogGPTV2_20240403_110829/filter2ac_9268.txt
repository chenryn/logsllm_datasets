### Title: Black Hat US 2021: Action Bias and the Two Most Dangerous Words in Cybersecurity

Most cybersecurity professionals recognize that achieving perfect security is an unattainable goal. Despite this, they strive for perfection, often experiencing feelings of loss, failure, and regret when incidents inevitably occur. In times of crisis or catastrophe, the human instinct is to react immediately and forcefully. This session will explore the concept of action bias, examining when immediate action is appropriate and when it can be counterproductive.

Behavioral science has shown that action bias can lead to wasteful spending and suboptimal outcomes. We will delve into how action bias affects users, security professionals, and leaders. For example, users may demand password resets and virus scans even when there is no evidence of a hack, a behavior that attackers often exploit in phishing campaigns. Similarly, CISOs and other security leaders may act quickly following a breach or attack, driven by a sense of urgency and a need for control, rather than conducting a deliberate analysis. This can result in costly defenses that may not justify the expense or mitigate the actual risk.

We will present countermeasures to reduce the occurrence and impact of action bias, based on insights from behavioral science. While cognitive biases cannot be entirely eliminated, tools such as "pre-flight" checklists and pre-mortems (as used in risk management) can help mitigate their dangers. By adopting these tools, the cybersecurity community can better address the two most dangerous words in the field: "never again." These words, often spoken in desperation, reflect a desire to prevent future incidents, but they can also lead to irrational and biased decision-making.

By being rationally prepared and using these tools, we can make unbiased decisions and improve our overall cybersecurity posture.
