Consider this very basic group by operation:
    df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c'], 'col2': [1, 3, 2, 5]})
    df_grp = df.groupby('col1')['col2']
When aggregating using `mean`, `min`, ... (everything but `count`) the
resulting Series has `col2` as its name:
    df_grp.mean()
    col1
    a       1.5
    b       3.0
    c       5.0
    Name: col2, dtype: float64
However, if I use `count` for aggregation, the name is not set:
    df_grp.count()
    col1
    a       2
    b       1
    c       1
    dtype: int64
Not a big problem for a simple case like that, but I stumbled over that while
working with a MultiIndex that needed to be reindexed and led to a `KeyError`
due to that missing column name.
