Abstract
The domain name service (DNS) plays an important role
in the operation of the Internet, providing a two-way map-
ping between domain names and their numerical identiﬁers.
Given its fundamental role, it is not surprising that a wide
variety of malicious activities involve the domain name ser-
vice in one way or another. For example, bots resolve DNS
names to locate their command and control servers, and
spam mails contain URLs that link to domains that resolve
to scam servers. Thus, it seems beneﬁcial to monitor the
use of the DNS system for signs that indicate that a certain
name is used as part of a malicious operation.
In this paper, we introduce EXPOSURE, a system that
employs large-scale, passive DNS analysis techniques to
detect domains that are involved in malicious activity. We
use 15 features that we extract from the DNS trafﬁc that al-
low us to characterize different properties of DNS names
and the ways that they are queried.
Our experiments with a large, real-world data set con-
sisting of 100 billion DNS requests, and a real-life deploy-
ment for two weeks in an ISP show that our approach is
scalable and that we are able to automatically identify un-
known malicious domains that are misused in a variety of
malicious activity (such as for botnet command and control,
spamming, and phishing).

Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical nam-
ing system for computers, services, or any resource con-
nected to the Internet. Clearly, as it helps Internet users lo-
cate resources such as web servers, mailing hosts, and other
online services, DNS is one of the core and most important
components of the Internet. Unfortunately, besides being
used for obvious benign purposes, domain names are also
popular for malicious use. For example, domain names are
increasingly playing a role for the management of botnet
command and control servers, download sites where mali-
cious code is hosted, and phishing pages that aim to steal
sensitive information from unsuspecting victims.
In a typical Internet attack scenario, whenever an at-
tacker manages to compromise and infect the computer of
an end-user, this machine is silently transformed into a bot
that listens and reacts to remote commands that are issued
by the so-called botmaster. Such collections of compro-
mised, remotely-controlled hosts are common on the Inter-
net, and are often used to launch DoS attacks, steal sensitive
user information, and send large numbers of spam messages
with the aim of making a ﬁnancial proﬁt.
In another typical Internet attack scenario, attackers set
up a phishing website and lure unsuspecting users into en-
tering sensitive information such as online banking creden-
tials and credit card numbers. The phishing website often
has the look and feel of the targeted legitimate website (e.g.,
an online banking service) and a domain name that sounds
similar.
One of the technical problems that attackers face when
designing their malicious infrastructures is the question of
how to implement a reliable and ﬂexible server infrastruc-
ture, and command and control mechanism. Ironically, the
attackers are faced with the same engineering challenges
that global enterprises face that need to maintain a large,
distributed and reliable service infrastructure for their cus-
tomers. For example, in the case of botnets, that are ar-
guably one of the most serious threats on the Internet today,
the attackers need to efﬁciently manage remote hosts that
may easily consists of thousands of compromised end-user
machines. Obviously, if the IP address of the command and
control server is hard-coded into the bot binary, there ex-
ists a single point of failure for the botnet. That is, from
the point of view of the attacker, whenever this address is
identiﬁed and is taken down, the botnet would be lost.
Analogously, in other common Internet attacks that tar-
get a large number of users, sophisticated hosting infras-
tructures are typically required that allow the attackers to
conduct activities such as collecting the stolen information,
distributing their malware, launching social engineering at-
tempts, and hosting other malicious services such as phish-
ing pages.
In order to better deal with the complexity of a large,
distributed infrastructure, attackers have been increasingly
making use of domain names. By using DNS, they ac-
quire the ﬂexibility to change the IP address of the mali-
cious servers that they manage. Furthermore, they can hide
their critical servers behind proxy services (e.g., using Fast-
Flux [36]) so that their malicious server is more difﬁcult to
identify and take down.
Using domain names gives attackers the ﬂexibility of
migrating their malicious servers with ease. That is, the
malicious “services” that the attackers offer become more
“fault-tolerant” with respect to the IP addresses where they
are hosted.
Our key insight in this paper is that as malicious services
are often as dependent on DNS services as benign services,
being able to identify malicious domains as soon as they ap-
pear would signiﬁcantly help mitigate many Internet threats
that stem from botnets, phishing sites, malware hosting ser-
vices, and the like. Also, our premise is that when looking
at large volumes of data, DNS requests for benign and mali-
cious domains should exhibit enough differences in behav-
ior that they can automatically be distinguished.
In this paper, we introduce a passive DNS analysis ap-
proach and a detection system, EXPOSURE, to effectively
and efﬁciently detect domain names that are involved in ma-
licious activity. We use 15 features (9 of which are novel
and have not been proposed before) that allow us to charac-
terize different properties of DNS names and the ways that
they are used (i.e., queried).
Note that researchers have used DNS before as a way to
analyze, measure and estimate the size of existing botnets
in the past (e.g., [21, 22, 34]). Some solutions have then at-
tempted to use DNS trafﬁc to detect malicious domains of a
certain type (e.g., [30, 36]). However, all these approaches
have only focused on speciﬁc classes of malware (e.g., only
malicious Fast-Flux services). Our approach, in compari-
son, is much more generic and is not only limited to certain
classes of attacks (e.g., only botnets).
In our approach, based on features that we have identi-
ﬁed and a training set that contains known benign and mali-
cious domains, we train a classiﬁer for DNS names. Being
able to passively monitor real-time DNS trafﬁc allows us to
identify malware domains that have not yet been revealed
by pre-compiled blacklists. Furthermore, in contrast to ac-
tive DNS monitoring techniques (e.g., [36]) that probe for
domains that are suspected to be malicious, our analysis is
stealthy, and we do not need to trigger speciﬁc malicious
activity in order to acquire information about the domain.
The stealthy analysis that we are able to perform has the ad-
vantage that our adversaries, the cyber-criminals, have no
means to block or hinder the analysis that we perform (in
contrast to approaches such as in [36]).
To date, only one system has been proposed that aims
to detect malicious domains generically using passive DNS
analysis.
In a concurrent and independent work that was
very recently presented by Antonakakis et al. [11], the au-
thors present Notos. Notos dynamically assigns reputation
scores to domain names whose maliciousness has not been
discovered yet. In comparison, our approach is not depen-
dent on large amounts of historical maliciousness data (e.g.,
IP addresses of previously infected servers), requires less
training time, and unlike Notos, is also able to detect mali-
cious domains that are mapped to a new address space each
time and never used for other malicious purposes again.
In our ofﬂine experiments, we have applied EXPO-
SURE to a large, real-world data set collected over a pe-
riod of two and a half months. The data that we used for
the initial training consists of DNS trafﬁc from the Secu-
rity Information Exchange (SIE) [7] that shares with us the
real-time response data from authoritative name servers lo-
cated in North America and in Europe. These sensors re-
ceive large amounts of data.
In fact, during the analysis
period of 2.5 months, our system monitored and analyzed
more than 100 billion DNS queries that targeted 4.8 million
distinct domain names.
• We present a novel analysis technique for the detec-
tion of malicious domains that is based on passive
Furthermore, in order to determine the feasibility of our
detection approach in real-life, we used EXPOSURE to
train on and monitor the DNS trafﬁc of a commercial ISP
that supports more than 30,000 clients. We were able to
identify more than 3000 new malicious domains that were
previously unknown to our system and were not in our train-
ing set. Moreover, we have cross-checked our detection re-
sults with public services such as malwareurl.com, McAffee
Site Advisor, and Norton Safe Web. The experimental re-
sults we present in this paper show that our approach is scal-
able, and that we are able to automatically identify domain
names that are misused in a variety of malicious activity.
In summary, our paper makes the following contribu-
tions:
DNS request analysis. Our technique does not rely on
prior knowledge about the kind of service the mali-
cious domain provides (e.g., phishing, Fast-Flux ser-
vices, spamming, botnets that use a domain generation
algorithm, etc.). This is signiﬁcantly different from
existing techniques that only target Fast-Flux domains
used in botnet operations. Furthermore, our approach
requires less training time, and less training data than
Notos [11], and does not have some of its limitations.
• We present 15 behavioral features that our system uses
in the the identiﬁcation of malicious domains. Of these
features, 9 have not been proposed before in previous
research.
• We describe the implementation of our real-time detec-
tion prototype system which we call EXPOSURE. We
used large volumes of DNS data that we collected over
a two and a half month period as the ofﬂine data set
for EXPOSURE. During this period, we recorded 100
billion DNS queries that resulted in 4.8 million dis-
tinct domain names. Furthermore, we deployed EX-
POSURE in real-life in an ISP and used it to monitor
the DNS trafﬁc of 30,000 clients. Our experimental
results show that the technique we propose is scalable,
and is able to accurately distinguish between malicious
and benign domains with a low false positive rate.
2 Overview of the Approach
The goal of EXPOSURE is to detect malicious domains
that are used as part of malicious operations on the Internet.
To this end, we perform a passive analysis of the DNS trafﬁc
that we have at our disposal. Since the trafﬁc we monitor is
generated by real users, we assume that some of these users
are infected with malicious content, and that some malware
components will be running on their systems. These com-
ponents are likely to contact the domains that are found to
be malicious by various sources such as public malware do-
main lists and spam blacklists. Hence, by studying the DNS
behavior of known malicious and benign domains, our goal
was to identify distinguishable generic features that are able
to deﬁne the maliciousness of a given domain.
2.1 Extracting DNS Features for Detection
Clearly, to be able to identify DNS features that allow
us to distinguish between benign and malicious domains,
and that allow a classiﬁer to work well in practice, large
amounts of training data are required. As the ofﬂine dataset,
we recorded the recursive DNS (i.e., RDNS) trafﬁc from
Security Information Exchange (SIE) [7]). We performed
ofﬂine analysis on this data and used it to determine DNS
features that can be used to distinguish malicious DNS fea-
tures from benign ones. The part of the RDNS trafﬁc we
used as initial input to our system consisted of the DNS an-
swers returned from the authoritative DNS servers to the
RDNS servers. An RDNS answer consists of the name of
the domain queried, the time the query is issued, the du-
ration the answer is required to be cached (i.e., TTL) and
the list of IP addresses that are associated with the queried
domain. Note that the RDNS servers do not share the infor-
mation of the DNS query source (i.e. the IP address of the
user that issues the query) due to privacy concerns.
By studying large amounts of DNS data, we deﬁned
15 different features that we use in the detection of mali-
cious domains. 6 of these features have been used in pre-
vious research( e.g.,
[29, 30, 36]), in particular in detect-
ing malicious Fast-Flux services or in classifying malicious
URLs [27]. The features that we use in the detection and our
rationale for selecting these features are explained in detail
in Section 3.
2.2 Architecture of EXPOSURE
Figure 1 gives an overview of the system architecture of
the EXPOSURE. The system consists of ﬁve main compo-
nents:
The ﬁrst component, the Data Collector, records the
DNS trafﬁc produced by the network that is being moni-
tored.
The second component is the Feature Attribution com-
ponent. This component is responsible for attributing the
domains that are recorded to the database with the features
that we are looking for in the DNS trafﬁc.
The third component, the Malicious and Benign Do-
mains Collector, works independent of, and in parallel to the
Data Collector Module. It collects domains that are known
to be benign or malicious from various sources. Our be-
nign domains sets are composed of information acquired
from Alexa [4] and a number of servers that provide de-
tailed WHOIS [2] data. In contrast, the malicious domain
set is constructed from domains that have been reported to
have been involved in malicious activities such as phish-
ing, spamming, and botnet infections by external sources
such as malwaredomains.com, Phishtank ([31]), and mal-
ware analyzers such as Anubis [13]). Note that these lists
are constantly updated, and become even more comprehen-
sive over time. The output of the Malicious and Benign
Domains Collector is used to label the output of the Feature
Attribution component.
Once the data is labeled, the labeled set is fed into the
fourth component: The Learning Module. This module
trains the labeled set to build malicious domain detection
models. Consequently, these models, and the unlabeled do-
mains, become an input to the ﬁfth component: The Classi-
Figure 1: Overview of EXPOSURE
ﬁer.
The Classiﬁer component takes decisions according to
the detection models produced by the Learning component
so that the unlabeled domains are grouped into two classes:
domains that are malicious, and those that are benign.
2.3 Real-Time Deployment
The deployment phase of EXPOSURE consists of two
steps. In the ﬁrst step, the features that we are interested in
are monitored and the classiﬁer is trained based on a set of
domains that are known to be benign or malicious. In a sec-
ond step, after the classiﬁer has been trained, the detection
starts and domains that are determined to be suspicious are
reported. Note that after an initial period of seven days of
training1, the classiﬁer is retrained every day. Hence, EX-
POSURE can constantly keep up with the behavior of new
malware.
3 Feature Selection
To determine the DNS features that are indicative of ma-
licious behavior, we tracked and studied the DNS usage
of several thousand well-known benign and malicious do-
mains for a period of several months (we obtained these
domains from the sources described in Section 4). Af-
ter this analysis period, we identiﬁed 15 features that are
able to characterize malicious DNS usage. Table1 gives an
overview of the components of the DNS requests that we
analyzed (i.e., feature sets) and the features that we identi-
ﬁed. In the following sections, we describe these features
and explain why we believe that they may be indicative of
malicious behavior.
3.1 Time-Based Features
The ﬁrst component of a DNS record that we analyze is
the time at which the request is made. Clearly, the time of
1We have experimentally determined the optimal training period to be
seven days (see Section 4.2.)
an individual request is not very useful by itself. However,
when we analyze many requests to a particular domain over
time, patterns indicative of malicious behavior may emerge.
In particular, we examine the changes of the volume (i.e.,
number) of requests for a domain. The time-based features
that we use in our analysis are novel and have not been stud-
ied before in previous approaches.
One of our insights is that malicious domains will often
show a sudden increase followed by a sudden decrease in
the number of requests. This is because malicious services
often use a technique called domain ﬂux [34] to make their
infrastructures more robust and ﬂexible against take downs.
Each bot may use a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to
compute a list of domains to be used as the command and
control server or the dropzone. Obviously, all domains that
are generated by a DGA have a short life span since they are
used only for a limited duration. Examples of malware that
make use of such DGAs are Kraken/Bobax [10], the Srizbi
bots [41] and the Conﬁcker worm [32]. Similarly, malicious
