User: I am interested in learning python but my Linux skills suck. I would like to develop a medium to large scale web application using python and django but afraid the software may not work well on a windows box. Is there a performance difference in running python on Linux vs Windows? Is there anything that I should watch out for when developing the application. Also, I am aware that it is very easy integrating C++ libraries with python. Is this statement still true is the code is on a windows box?
Assistant: Python program is very easily portable. Most of the time your code will work on any platform that have the appropriate version of python.
One point to be aware of though, is file path handling. Linux, Windows, Macs, etc uses different path schemes, so you shouldn't be handling them as strings; instead use os.path functions to join, split, etc.
There is ultimately some slight performance difference with regard to timing, threading, processing, I/O, but they're nothing to worry about.
Integrating Python and C++ is easy; the only problem is in the C++ side, i.e. you will have to recompile the C++ code.
