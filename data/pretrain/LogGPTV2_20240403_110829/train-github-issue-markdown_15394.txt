### Apache Airflow version
Other Airflow 2 version
### What happened
We noticed that tasks using the dynamic task mapping api crashes the scheduler
with the error
    psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "task_instance_pkey"
    80
    DETAIL:  Key (dag_id, task_id, run_id, map_index)=(ingestion-scheduler, check_for_success_flag, manual__2022-10-03T15:56:03.241451+00:00, 0) already exists.
We have 2 schedulers so my guess is that both try to schedule the dynamically
mapped task
### What you think should happen instead
it should be not crash the scheduler
### How to reproduce
run a large dynamically mapped task in multi-scheduler environment
### Operating System
linux
