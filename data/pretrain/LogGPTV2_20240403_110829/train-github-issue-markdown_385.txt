All responsive classes (both by device size and print) don't like inline
elements like  to be hidden and shown correctly without breaking it.
Example:
     Email
It does hide the span correctly when the screensize is below 768px, however
when visible it's placed below the icon since it recieves a display:block.
Possible solution:  
Add display:inline-block for elements like a, span, i, em, strong, etc when
used in combination with responsive classes.
