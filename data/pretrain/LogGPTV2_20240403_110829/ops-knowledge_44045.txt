**Inquiry: Integrating Google Code Commits with Google AppEngine Deployment**

I am currently working on a simple Google AppEngine project, and the source code is hosted on Google Code. I am interested in automating the deployment process so that every time I commit to Subversion, the latest code is automatically deployed to AppEngine. Since this project is primarily for personal use and learning, I am not concerned if the live site occasionally experiences issues.

**Question:**
- Is it possible to integrate Google Code commits to trigger an automatic deployment to Google AppEngine?
- How can I set up a system to tie into the Subversion commit for the Google Code repository and initiate the deployment to AppEngine?
- Ideally, the solution should be fully automated and not require any manual intervention or additional server/listener software on my local machine.

**Additional Context:**
For those who are using GitHub, the availability of such a feature from the Google AppEngine team could be a compelling reason to consider switching to Google Code.
