User: As is mentioned in the doc for google app engine, it does not support group by and other aggregation functions. Is there any alternatives to implement the same functionality?
I am working on a project where I need it on urgent basis, being a large database its not efficient to iterate the result set and then perform the logic.
Please suggest.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: The best way is to populate the summaries (aggregates) at the time of write. This way your reads will be faster, since they just read - at the cost of writes which will have to update the summaries if its likely to be effected by the write. 
Hopefully you will be reading more often than writing/updating summaries.
