transformations from a OTS to a MTS scheme.
9.1 Construction
The basic idea of our construction is to store the keys
of the one-time signature scheme in the leaves of the CAT.
Since the keys are generated uniformly at random (and in
particular, independent of the message to be signed) a weaker
security notion than the one giving in Deﬁnition 4.2 is suf-
ﬁcient. We refer the reader to the full version [SS12].
Construction 3. Let Sig = (Gen, Sign, Vrfy) be a signature
scheme deﬁned over the message space M = {0, 1}λ and
let wCAT = (wcatGen, waddLeaf, wcatVrfy) be a chameleon
authentication tree. We deﬁne the signature scheme cSig =
(cGen, cSign, cVrfy) as follows:
cGen(1λ): The key generation algorithm runs (wsp, wvp) ←
It returns the private key SK ← wsp,
wcatGen(1λ).
and the corresponding public key PK ← wvp.
cSign(SK, m): To sign a message m ∈ {0, 1}λ, the signing
algorithm generates a key pair (SK(cid:48), PK(cid:48)) ← Gen(1λ),
signs the message σ0 ← Sign(SK(cid:48), m), and adds the
public key to the CAT by computing (wsp(cid:48), i, waPath) ←
waddLeaf(wsp, PK(cid:48)). It sets σ1 ← (i, waPath) and re-
turns the signature σ ← (σ0, σ1, PK(cid:48)).
cVrfy(PK, m, σ): The veriﬁcation algorithm parses PK =
It
wvp and σ = (σ0, σ1, PK(cid:48)) and σ1 = (i, waPath).
962outputs 1 if both condition hold: catVrfy(wvp, i, PK(cid:48),
aPath) = 1 and Vrfy(PK(cid:48), m, σ0) = 1.
As already discussed in Section 6.1, the security of our con-
struction holds for a tree that authenticates an exponential
number of 2D signatures. Again, this follows from our con-
struction (as we never store all elements at the same time).
Let q := q(λ) be an upper bound on the number of signing
queries from the adversary. Then, we distinguish the case
where the adversary outputs a forgery for a leaf 1 ≤ i∗ ≤ q
and the case where q + 1 ≤ i∗ ≤ 2D. In the ﬁrst case, where
1 ≤ i∗ ≤ q is, we build an adversary that either breaks
the structure-preserving property of the CAT or that forges
the one-time signature scheme. In the second case, where
q + 1 ≤ i∗ ≤ 2D is, we show how to beak the one-wayness
the CAT.
Theorem 4. If Sig is a secure one-time signature scheme
and CAT a weakly structure-preserving and weakly one-way
chameleon authentication tree, then Construction 3 is un-
forgeable under adaptive chosen message attacks.
The proof is giving in the full version of this paper [SS12].
