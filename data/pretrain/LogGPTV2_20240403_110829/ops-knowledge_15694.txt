User: In the Ubuntu system, how to install and configure the MySQL database through the command line?
Assistant: 1. Install MySQL Enter the following commands in the terminal: ``` sudo apt update sudo apt install mysql-server ``` During the installation process, you need to set the password of the root user of MySQL. 2. Configure MySQL First, use the following command to connect to the MySQL service: ``` sudo mysql ``` Then, you can do the following: 2.1 Create a user and password Create a new user with the following command: ``` CREATE USER 'username' @'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; ``` Replace `username` and `password` with your actual username and password. `%` can be used instead of `localhost` to allow connections from any host. 2.2 Create a database Use the following command to create a new database: ``` CREATE DATABASE dbname; ``` Replace `dbname` with the actual database name. 2.3 Granting user access to the database Use the following command to assign a user to a database and grant privileges: ``` GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbname.* TO 'username'@'localhost'; ``` This will grant the user full access to the database . Note: In order for the changes to take effect, you need to use the following command to refresh the MySQL privilege table: ``` FLUSH PRIVILEGES; ``` 3. Test MySQL Exit the MySQL service using the following command: ``` exit ``` Enter the following command in the terminal to check if MySQL is started: ``` sudo systemctl status mysql ``` If MySQL is running, it should show a status of "active (running)". Now, you can use the MySQL client to connect to the MySQL server and start using MySQL.
