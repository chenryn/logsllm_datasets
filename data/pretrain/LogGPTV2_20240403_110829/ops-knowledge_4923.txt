User: Please analyze the detailed process of an HTTP request from the application level, including steps such as DNS resolution, establishment of a TCP connection, sending a request, and receiving a response.
Assistant: 1. DNS resolution When the user enters a URL in the address bar of the browser, the browser will send the URL to the DNS server, and the DNS server will resolve the URL into the corresponding IP address in order to access the website. 2. Establish a TCP connection The browser will establish a TCP connection with the server, that is, a 3-way handshake to ensure that the browser and the server can communicate successfully, and encryption protection protects the communication between the client and the server. 3. Send request After the TCP connection is established, the browser will send an HTTP request, the request content includes: request type, URL, request header and other information. 4. Server response When the server receives the request, it will respond, and the response content includes: status code, response header, response body and other information. 5. Receiving the response The browser receives the response returned from the server and processes the response. If the response status code is 200, it means the request is successful. The browser will parse the response content according to the response header and render it on the page. 6. Close the TCP connection When the response processing is completed, the browser will actively close the TCP connection to prepare for the next request.
