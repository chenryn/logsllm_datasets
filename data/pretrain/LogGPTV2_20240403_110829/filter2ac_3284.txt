**ATT&CK ID:** T1069.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Local Groups

Adversaries may attempt to identify local system groups and their associated permission settings. Understanding the structure and membership of these groups can provide valuable information about which users have elevated privileges, such as those in the local administrators group. This knowledge can be leveraged by adversaries to target specific accounts with higher access rights, thereby facilitating further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
