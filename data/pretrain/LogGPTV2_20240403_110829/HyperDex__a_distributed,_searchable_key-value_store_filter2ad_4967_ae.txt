### Multi-Ring and Space-Filling Curve Approaches

When a multi-ring implementation is not available, Cassandra employs a similar design, which can provide insights into the performance of a multi-ring-based system. Arpeggio [13] supports search over multiple attributes by enumerating and indexing all fixed-size subsets of attributes using a Chord ring. Both approaches insert redundant pointers into the rings without ensuring consistency.

#### Space-Filling Curves

A common approach for multi-attribute search involves using space-filling curves to partition multi-dimensional data across storage nodes. This method maps multi-dimensional data into a single dimension, allowing the use of traditional peer-to-peer techniques for searching. Examples include SCRAP [21], Squid [52], and ZNet [53], where each node is responsible for a contiguous range of values. MAAN [10] uses a similar mapping but with uniform locality-preserving hashing. However, space-filling curves do not scale well with high dimensionality, as a single search query may be split into many one-dimensional ranges of varying sizes. Unlike HyperDex, fully-qualified searches in space-filling curve-based systems may require contacting multiple nodes.

### NoSQL Storage Systems

A new class of scalable storage systems, collectively known as "NoSQL," has emerged, diverging from the traditional relational database architecture and SQL interface. NoSQL systems often make explicit trade-offs, such as sacrificing consistency for availability under extreme failure scenarios. These systems include document databases [16, 37] with schema-free data models, in-memory cache solutions [36, 43, 48] that enhance application performance, and graph databases [38] that model interconnected elements. Some systems, like Yahoo!’s PNUTS [14], support traditional SQL selection and projection but do not support joins.

HyperDex explores a new point in the NoSQL design space by providing a rich API with qualitative new functionality. It combines strong consistency properties with fault-tolerance guarantees, offering a high-performance solution that sets a new standard for future NoSQL systems.

### Key-Value Stores

Modern key-value stores have roots in distributed data structures [23, 36] and distributed hash tables [29, 47, 50, 55]. Most open-source key-value stores are influenced by the ring-based architecture of Dynamo [19] and the tablet-based architecture of BigTable [11]. For example, Voldemort [45] and Riak [49] are heavily influenced by Dynamo’s design, while HBase [25] and HyperTable [28] are open-source implementations of BigTable. Cassandra [32] uniquely combines BigTable’s API with Dynamo’s ring structure. Like HyperDex, these systems are designed to run on many machines in a datacenter environment.

Recent work on key-value stores focuses on improving performance by leveraging underlying hardware or manipulating consistency guarantees. Fawn KV [4] enhances throughput-to-power-draw ratio on underpowered hardware, while SILT [33] eliminates read amplification to maximize read bandwidth in solid-state disk-backed datastores. RAMCloud [40] stores data in RAM and uses fast network connections for rapid replica restoration. TSSL [54] exploits a multi-tier storage hierarchy for cache-oblivious algorithms. Masstree [35] uses concatenated B+ trees to handle millions of queries per second, and COPS [34] provides a high-performance, geo-replicated key-value store with causal+ consistency. Other systems [12, 19] trade consistency for other desirable properties, such as performance. Spanner [18] uses Paxos to provide strong consistency in wide-area networks, and Spinnaker [46] builds a strongly consistent store that performs nearly as well as eventually consistent systems [19, 44, 56].

Each of these existing systems improves the performance, availability, or consistency of key-value stores while maintaining the basic structure of a hash table. In contrast, HyperDex expands the key-value interface to support operations like secondary attribute search.

### Discussion

The open-source release of HyperDex [20] revealed various misunderstandings surrounding the CAP Theorem [22]. The popular CAP refrain ("C, A, P: pick any two") often oversimplifies the definitions of consistency (C), availability (A), and partition tolerance (P). There is no conflict between HyperDex's claims and the CAP Theorem. The CAP Theorem assumes an unconstrained failure model, where partitions and node failures can affect any number of servers and network links. No system, including HyperDex, can simultaneously offer strong consistency and availability under such weak assumptions. HyperDex makes a stronger assumption, limiting failures to affect at most a threshold of servers, thus enabling it to provide seemingly impossible guarantees.

### Conclusions

This paper describes HyperDex, a second-generation NoSQL storage system that combines strong consistency guarantees with high availability in the presence of failures and partitions affecting up to a threshold of servers. Additionally, HyperDex provides an efficient search primitive for retrieving objects through their secondary attributes. It achieves this extended functionality through hyperspace hashing, where multi-attribute objects are deterministically mapped to coordinates in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This mapping leads to efficient implementations for key-based retrieval, partially-specified searches, and range queries. HyperDex’s novel replication protocol enables the system to provide strong consistency without sacrificing performance. Industry-standard benchmarks show that the system is practical and efficient.

The trend toward NoSQL data stores has been driven by scalability and performance concerns, often at the cost of functionality. HyperDex bridges this gap by providing additional functionality without compromising scalability or performance.
