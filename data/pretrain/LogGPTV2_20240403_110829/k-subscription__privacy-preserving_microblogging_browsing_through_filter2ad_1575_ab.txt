user, e.g., as a user subscribes to these k channels in a short period.
Since along with channel C a user follows k − 1 other channels as
well, the disclosure probability is PC = 1/k. However, for large
values of k (i.e., in cases where the user wants to add a lot of noise)
the microblogging service has a more effective way to increase its
certainty about the interest of a user in a particular channel C. It
knows that the UC users who are interested in channel C actually
follow it. At the same time, however, there are U − UC other users

that are not interested in C, who may have randomly included C
among their noise channels. The probability of C being included
in the set of channels followed randomly by a user interested in a
channel different than C is bounded by 1 − (1 − 1/|S|)k−1, as
this user will select k − 1 channels randomly from S, which also
includes C. Therefore, the average number of the U − UC users
not interested in C that will follow C randomly as noise (URC ) are
less than (U − UC ) × (1 − (1 − 1/|S|)k−1). So, the ratio of users
following C who are really interested in C is less than
UC + (U − UC ) × (1 − (1 − 1/|S|)k−1)
UC
Since the microblogging service does not know who are the users
UC interested in the channel C, it can only assume that all users
following C are interested in C. The probability of a user following
C actually being interested in C (denoted as PC ) is given by:
PC  max(1/k,

UC + (U − UC ) × (1 − (1 − UC /U)k−1)

where pC is the channel’s popularity. We observe that instead of the
total number of users U and the number of users UC that follow the
channel C, the disclosure probability is affected only by channel’s
popularity pC, number of channels S, and obfuscation level k.
Figure 3 shows how disclosure probability changes with the level
of obfuscation k. We see that our k-subscription-PROP approach is
able to efﬁciently hide popular channels. Indeed, for a popularity of
about 10%, it is able to reach a disclosure probability of 0.1 using
only k = 40. When the popularity is 1%, even small obfuscation
levels such as k = 50 can lead to disclosure probability as low
as 0.02, which is very encouraging. One can notice in Figure 3
that as k increases for 10% popularity, the disclosure probability
tends to ﬂatten out and in no case drops below 0.1. The reason is
that for a channel with 10% popularity, the disclosure probability
can never fall below 10% no matter how large the obfuscation level
we use is. There is a simple explanation for this: without taking
any channel-following information into account, the microblogging
service knows that 10% of the population is interested in channel
C. Hence, the microblogging service can safely assume that a user
is interested in C with probability 0.1.
3.3 Analysis for Multiple Channels
A user may want to follow more than one sensitive channels,
which may be semantically related to each other. For simplicity,
we assume that all users U are interested in exactly N sensitive
channels from S. Each user that is actually interested to follow the
N channels C1, ..., CN will also follow (k −1)×N noise channels
based on random choices from S. Besides the UC1 ,...,CN users that
are interested in these N channels, there will be some other users
that will follow the same set of N channels without being interested
in all of them, due to random noise channel selections. These users
contribute to hide the actual interests of the UC1 ,...,CN users.
Since the microblogging service does not know the users who
are actually interested in channels C1, ..., CN , it can only assume
that all users following these channels are interested in them. The
