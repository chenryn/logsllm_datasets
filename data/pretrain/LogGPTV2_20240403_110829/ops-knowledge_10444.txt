User: According to the following data backup strategy, please provide a reasonable plan to store backup data and keep historical records Data backup cycle: Daily\nData backup method: Full backup\nData backup quantity: Keep backup data of the last 7 days\nData Backup size: about 500GB/time
Assistant: The following solutions are recommended to store backup data and retain historical records: 1. Use hard disk arrays or network storage devices as backup storage devices to ensure the safety and reliability of backup data. 2. In the backup storage device, create a new folder for the daily backup data, for example named after the date (eg 20201201). 3. Full backup is performed every day, and compression technology can be used to compress the data during the backup process to reduce the space occupied by the backup data. 4. After the backup is completed, store the backup data folder in the specified directory of the backup storage device, and record the backup date, backup folder name and other related information. 5. Regularly clean up the backup storage device every week, keep the backup data of the last 7 days, and delete the expired backup data. 6. In the backup storage device, it is recommended to set backup data access permissions to prevent malicious operations or deletion of backup data. Note: The backup is recommended to be stored in an offline, fire-proof, theft-proof, insect-proof, and magnetic-proof place.
