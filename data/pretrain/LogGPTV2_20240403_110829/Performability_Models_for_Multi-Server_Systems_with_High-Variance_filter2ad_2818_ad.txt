### 10−1 0 M/2−Burst/1 Queue: ON=90, OFF=10, ν

- **Parameters:**
  - \( S = 2.0 \)
  - \( \alpha = 1.4 \)
  - \( T = 5 \)
  - \( \theta = 0.50 \)

### Analytic Result and Simulations

- **Simulation of M/2−Burst/1 Queue:**
  - **Analytic Result:**
    - The plot marked with circles shows the effect of the load independence assumption, which is only observable for short queue lengths.
  - **Simulation of Multi-processor System:**
    - The plot marked with crosses corresponds to a simulation of the exact analytical model and is used to validate the numerical results.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Even without reduced state space representations, the blow-up points in terms of tail probabilities of the queue-length distribution can be clearly seen for larger \( N \). For example, in Figure 6 for \( N = 5 \), all five blow-up points are very pronounced.

### 4. Simulation Experiments

- **Purpose:**
  - To evaluate the effect of the load-independence assumption in the analytic model.
  - To explore the model under more general assumptions, including the failure handling strategies presented in Section 2.

- **Challenges:**
  - Creating simulations that sample the TPT (Time to Process Task) distribution is inherently difficult due to the power-tail behavior of the repair time distribution.
  - The repair-time distribution eventually drops off exponentially, corresponding to a truncated tail. This truncation can also be an artifact of the finiteness of sample sets in measurements or simulation experiments.

- **Example:**
  - Taking a large set of \( K \) samples from inter-arrival times of the TPT-DOWN model with infinite tail corresponds to sampling on average \( L := \frac{K}{\lambda E(\text{UP} + \text{DOWN})} \) DOWN periods, or \( L \) power-tail samples.
  - For high-quality components, UP periods can be very long (days to months), making the number of power-tail samples small. Therefore, simulations require immensely long virtual time to ensure adequate sampling of the tails.

### Figure 7: Simulation of a 2-server system

- **Comparison:**
  - The plot marked with circles shows the effect of the load independence assumption, which is only observable for short queue lengths.
  - The plot marked with crosses corresponds to a simulation of the exact analytical model and is used to validate the numerical results.
  - The main difference in the multi-processor system is that the service rate is modulated by both the number of active servers and the queue length. This impact is only visible for small queue lengths.

### Figure 8: Comparison between Analytic Model and Simulation Results

- **Results:**
  - The simulation results show that the failure handling strategies (Discard, Resume, Restart) behave almost identically with respect to mean queue length when task times are exponentially distributed.
  - The 95% confidence interval plotted is for the Discard strategy.
  - Each sample point represents the mean of 10 independent runs, each using \( 2 \times 10^5 \) UP/DOWN cycles.
  - The choice of parameter values for the UP and DOWN periods (90 and 10, respectively) relative to the mean task service time (1) was to allow for reasonable simulation times.
  - To improve the stability of the simulation results and provide more realistic parameter values, techniques such as importance sampling may be investigated.

### Figure 9: Simulation of M/2-Burst/1 system with hyperexponential task service times

- **Results:**
  - The ordering of the failure handling strategies (Discard, Resume, Restart) holds, but the difference in mean queue length is more significant compared to Figure 8.
  - The blowup behavior can still be observed for all three variations.
  - Other simulations show that for the Resume and Restart recovery models, placing the interrupted task at the back of the queue is better than placing it at the front.

### 5. Summary

- **Analytic Model:**
  - Presents an analytic model of a cluster of \( N \) nodes subject to failure and repair.
  - Formulates the model for general matrix-exponential repair and failure times, focusing on high-variance repair times due to their practical relevance.
  - Under certain assumptions, the cluster model can be expressed as a single server M/MMPP/1 queue, similar to earlier teletraffic models.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Focuses on the mean queue length and tail probabilities of the queue-length distributions, which can be mapped to successful task completion probabilities under delay constraints.
  - Parameter variations (e.g., number of server nodes \( N \), availability \( A \), degradation factor \( \delta \), service rate during UP \( \nu_p \), and task arrival rate \( \lambda \)) can lead to dramatic changes in performance metrics, referred to as blowup points.
  - The exact placement of the blowup boundaries in the parameter space is obtained in Section 3.

- **Validation:**
  - Analytic results are confirmed by simulation experiments, showing that the existence of blowup points is robust to model variations, including the type of participating distributions and the failure handling strategy employed.
