  * Electron version: 2.0.6
  * Operating system: MacOS High Sierra (latest)
### Expected behavior
The mas build should be accepted by the App Store.
### Actual behavior
The App Store suddenly started to reject my mas build based on the Electron
Framework v. 1.7.9. The upgrade to the last stable version 2.0.6 didnâ€™t solve
the problem. Any ideas?
I always get the following message:
Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:
From framework:  
-Symbol: _CGDisplayUsesForceToGray  
From framework:
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Versions/A/CoreGraphics  
-Symbols: ___CFRunLoopSetOptionsReason, __CFIsObjC  
From framework:
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation
In binary:  
-Contents/Frameworks/Electron Framework.framework/Versions/A/Electron Framework
Please help.
