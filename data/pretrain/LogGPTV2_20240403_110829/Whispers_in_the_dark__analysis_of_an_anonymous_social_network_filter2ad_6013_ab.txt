 0 indicates that nodes tend to connect with
other nodes of similar degree, while assortativity < 0 indicates that
nodes connect to others with dissimilar degrees. Our result shows
the assortativity coefﬁcient of Whisper graph is very close to zero
(-0.011), which closely resembles a random graph [29]. In con-
trast, similar users tend to ﬂock together in social networks with
bidirectional links (e.g., Facebook), producing positive assortativity
(0.116). In Twitter, large numbers of normal users follow celebri-
ties and notable ﬁgures, thus producing a more negative assortativ-
ity (-0.025).
4.2 Communities in the Interaction Graph
Next, we analyze the presence of community structures in Whis-
per’s interaction graph. Communities are deﬁned as groups of nodes
that are densely connected within but sparsely connected to the rest
of the network, i.e. high modularity. We seek to answer two key
questions. First, without persistent social links, do Whisper users
still form communities in the interaction graph? Second, if so,
what’s the key factor driving the formation of user communities?
Community Detection.
We start by applying community de-
tection algorithms to Whisper graphs to examine whether commu-
nity structures exist. We choose two widely used community de-
tection algorithms Louvain [7] and Wakita [37]. We compute the
modularity of the resulting communities. Modularity [28] is a well
accepted metric used for community detection, which measures the
difference between the fraction of links within the communities and

communities in the graph.
