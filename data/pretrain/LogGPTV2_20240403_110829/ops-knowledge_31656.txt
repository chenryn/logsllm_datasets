User: Please describe what is Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?
Assistant: Continuous integration is a development methodology whose purpose is to integrate code into a single code base and automatically build and test the code to ensure its quality. In continuous integration, developers must perform automated tests and builds before the code is committed to the code repository. This can help ensure code maintainability and quality, while also reducing code integration effort. Continuous delivery is a software development methodology whose purpose is to ensure that software is ready to be deployed in production at any point. In continuous delivery, developers write automated tests and build scripts to ensure that code is verified and tested before being released to production and ready for deployment. This can help ensure software reliability and stability, while also reducing the time and cost of deployment.
