### 7.2 RQ2: Accuracy of Attack Detector

#### Evaluation on Ground-truth Apps
Table 1 shows the detection results for the 12 Moriarty apps in the ground truth dataset. StateDroid detects 11 actions and 4 action sequence-based attacks. For example, ID 1 app performs a contacts theft attack, which is captured by an Attack State Machine comprising two actions: (i) reading user names and phone numbers from a contacts database, and (ii) leaking this data by writing it into a sink API. We also find common attacks in multiple versions (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12) that read data from a file ("Sherlock/userMailHashed.json") and pass it to a sink API. Actions in ID 10 and 11 are not reported because the bytecode of both apps does not have the implementations of relevant malicious behaviors. Our manual verification reports no false positives and no false negatives.

#### Evaluation on Malware Apps
StateDroid detects 135 stealthy attacks in total from malware apps, with about 30% being action sequence-based attacks. Table 2 shows four cases of such action sequence-based attacks. Row 2 shows the detected action sequence of NickySpy.C, which spies on victims by executing multiple actions such as leakage of SMS messages and call logs, recording audio, and aborting broadcast notifications. NickySpy.C reveals an advanced stealthy attack that silently answers incoming phone calls and removes its traces. Specifically, on receiving an incoming phone call, the attack takes up to 9 actions in the given order. NickySpy was reported as the first Android malware to have the ability to record phone calls [28]. Rows 3–5 of Table 2 show Android.HeHe’s three action sequence-based attacks: (1) silently blocking incoming phone calls, (2) making short-duration phone calls, and (3) silently blocking incoming SMS messages. Android.HeHe’s very low VirusTotal detection ratio [20] indicates that stealthy malware has more chances to stay undetected.

#### Evaluation on Benign Apps
StateDroid detects that 117 out of 1,505 Google Play apps exhibit various stealthy behaviors. For example, an app named "Couple Tracker" performs spying behaviors such as the leakage of sensitive information on incoming call logs and SMS messages. The "com.appybuilder.andrewfortier.rau" app reveals suspicious behaviors such as recording audio files, enabling or disabling WiFi, and privacy leakage (e.g., incoming SMS messages). Another app (com.drsalomon.apk), labeled as Trojan by VirusTotal, can make phone calls to three hard-coded numbers. Other apps for which StateDroid detects recording audio files (com.guide.yanderesimulator.chutimaka) and leaking lists of installed packages (com.helloneighboor) have been removed from the Google Play store after a few weeks of being downloaded.

### 7.3 RQ3: Comparison with Existing Tools

The closest work to our approach in stealthy behavior detection is AsDroid (Anti-Stealth Droid) [29]. AsDroid detects a special type of stealthy behavior by detecting mismatches or incompatibilities between the behavior implemented by a listener of a user interface component and the text shown on that component. AsDroid and StateDroid are two very different approaches. The former detects mismatches between user expectations and implemented behavior, while StateDroid detects suspicious API call patterns, including sophisticated API call sequences. We believe these two approaches are complementary, although their results may overlap.

In Section 7.1, we identify 49 malware families that reveal stealthy attacks. To compare StateDroid and AsDroid, we select 49 samples randomly from each of these malware families. Due to the unavailability of AsDroid's source code, we simulate AsDroid’s analysis on 49 samples, and the comparisons are as follows:

1. **Detection Capabilities**: StateDroid focuses on detecting sophisticated API call sequences, while AsDroid identifies mismatches between UI components and their behaviors.
2. **False Positives and Negatives**: Both tools aim to minimize false positives and negatives, but StateDroid's approach is more focused on identifying complex, multi-step attack sequences.
3. **Complementary Nature**: The two approaches can be used together to provide a more comprehensive detection system, covering both UI-based and API-based stealthy behaviors.

By combining the strengths of both tools, we can enhance the overall detection and mitigation of stealthy malware on Android devices.
