Software as a Service (SaaS) Software as a Service Cloud computing advantages: 1. Cost-effectiveness : The use of cloud computing can avoid purchasing and maintaining expensive equipment such as hardware, software and servers. 2. Flexibility: Cloud computing provides flexibility, and users can increase or decrease capacity according to workload needs. 3. Reliability: Cloud computing servers and devices are strictly regulated and maintained, making them more reliable and stable. 4. Security: Cloud computing provides multiple security measures, including firewall, encryption, backup, monitoring and auditing. 5. Scalability: The architecture of cloud computing can be easily expanded to handle more workloads and data. Disadvantages of cloud computing: 1. Reliance on the network: Cloud computing needs to rely on the network, and network instability or interruption will affect the bearing capacity of the entire service. 2. Data security: User data is stored in the cloud platform, if there are security issues such as data leakage, it will cause greater losses. 3. Service provider: When choosing a cloud computing service provider, you need to consider service reliability and security. If the service provider encounters problems, it will affect the user's business. 4. Performance issues: During busy hours, the performance and throughput of the cloud platform may decrease due to many users sharing the cloud platform. 5. Privacy issues: Although cloud computing provides multiple security guarantees, the user's data and privacy are at risk of being abused. Since the data is not located locally, more attention should be paid to its security protection.
