## Pivoting through Cobalt Strike

In [Chapter 6](#pivoting-1), we covered the different ways of pivoting and why it is necessary. In this section, we will explore how to pivot into a network using Cobalt Strike.

Cobalt Strike provides three methods for pivoting:

- **SOCKS Server**
- **Listener**
- **Deploy VPN**

### SOCKS Server

A SOCKS Server creates a **SOCKS4 proxy** on the team server. All connections through this proxy are converted into tasks for the beacon to execute, allowing us to tunnel inside the network through any type of beacon.

To set up a SOCKS Server:
1. Right-click the host.
2. Choose `Pivoting` > `SOCKS Server`.
3. Enter the port number and click `Launch`.

Once the server is started, you can use tools like Metasploit or Nmap for further reconnaissance and exploitation.

### Listener

A pivot listener tunnels all its traffic through a beacon session, minimizing new connections from the Cobalt Strike server to the victim's machine.

To set up a listener:
1. Right-click the host.
2. Choose `Pivoting` > `Listener...`.
3. Specify the listener's name, payload, host, port number, and the remote host and port.
4. Click `Save`.

This will run a `rportfwd` command and create a tunnel.

### Deploy VPN

The Deploy VPN feature allows pivoting through a covert VPN, creating a network interface from the system where the team server is running to the target network.

To set up a VPN:
1. Right-click the host.
2. Choose `Pivoting` > `Deploy VPN`.
3. Choose the destination network and add a network interface.
4. Specify the interface name, MAC address, port number, and channel (UDP recommended for best performance).

Click `Deploy` to create the interface. You can view active VPN channels from the Cobalt Strike menu.

## Aggressor Scripts

Aggressor Scripts is the scripting language for Cobalt Strike 3.0 and above, succeeding the Cortana scripting language used by Armitage. It is described as a tool for red team operations and adversary simulations, inspired by scriptable IRC clients and bots. It can be used to create long-running bots and extend the Cobalt Strike client.

### Loading Aggressor Scripts

1. Download scripts from GitHub: [https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/AggressorScripts](https://github.com/bluscreenofjeff/AggressorScripts)
2. Open Cobalt Strike and go to `Script Manager`.
3. Click `Load` and browse to the directory where you downloaded the script.
4. Select the script and click `Open`.

For example, loading `ping_aliases.cna` and `ps-window-alias` creates new aliases for commands like `qping` and `smbscan`.

### Testing the Script

1. Interact with the beacon and run `qping 8.8.8.8` to test the ping command.
2. Run `ps-windows-alias` to open the process pane of the selected host.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned about the listener module of Cobalt Strike, including its types and usage. We explored beacons and their features, and examined different methods of pivoting using Cobalt Strike. Finally, we delved into Aggressor Scripts and their use in Cobalt Strike.

## Questions

1. Is Cobalt Strike free?
2. Can Cobalt Strike communicate with other C2s?
3. How can we slip through scanners and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?
4. Does Cobalt Strike use the Metasploit Framework?

## C2 - Master of Puppets

A Command and Control (C2) server is a system used in cyberattacks to control infected systems. In red team operations, C2s are used to simulate cyberattacks, not to steal data. The motivation is to test and improve an organization's defenses.

### Introduction to C2

In red team engagements, C2s manage reverse connections. Tools like Koadic, Armitage, Cobalt Strike, and Empire are frameworks that handle multiple connections. A major challenge is avoiding detection by antivirus software or firewalls.

### Cloud-based File Sharing Using C2

Organizations often use cloud-based file sharing services, which can be exploited for stealthy communication. We can use Dropbox and OneDrive as middlemen to set up communication between the target server and the Empire C2.

#### Using Dropbox as the C2

1. Register for a Dropbox account and create an app.
2. Generate an API token.
3. Set the API token in the Empire dbx listener.
4. Start the dbx listener and use a stager to connect the target to the Dropbox C2.

#### Using OneDrive as the C2

1. Create a OneDrive listener in Empire.
2. Set up the listener and use a stager to connect the target to the OneDrive C2.

By using these cloud services, we can avoid detection and maintain a stealthy presence in the target network.
