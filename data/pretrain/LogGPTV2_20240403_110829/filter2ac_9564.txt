**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Email Hiding Rules

Adversaries may exploit email rules to conceal incoming messages within a compromised user's mailbox. Most email clients provide the functionality for users to create inbox rules that manage various aspects of email handling, such as moving emails to different folders, marking them as read, or even deleting them. These rules can be established or altered either directly through the email client interface or by using external tools, such as the `New-InboxRule` or `Set-InboxRule` PowerShell cmdlets on Windows systems.

This technique allows attackers to maintain a low profile and evade detection by automatically redirecting or modifying incoming emails, thereby preventing the legitimate user from noticing suspicious activity.
