User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MySQL Master-Master Replication of ALL databases. How? Background: I have two MySQL 5.1 servers setup in Master-Master row-based-replication (RBR) following this excellent guide.  I want all databases replicated, and will be adding new databases regularly.

Goal: I would like to be able to add new databases to replication by just adding the DB to one of the servers;  without having to stop both slaves, change the configuration files, restart the MySQL servers, and start the slaves again.

Question:  From what I've read, I think I can do this by simply omitting any binlog-do-db, binlog-ignore-db, replicate-do-db, and replicate-ignore-db settings in each server's configuration, but I can't be sure.  MySQL's docs on how Database- and Table-level replication options are evaluated make me think there might be no way to accomplish this at all.

Relevant portions of my /etc/mysql/my.cnf files are copied below.  Am I on the right track?  Is what I want even possible?

Master 1:

[mysqld]
binlog-format = row
server-id = 1
replicate-same-server-id = 0
auto-increment-increment = 2
auto-increment-offset = 1

master-host = &lt;master2_ip&gt;
master-user = slave_user
master-password = &lt;password&gt;
master-connect-retry = 60

log-bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
relay-log = /var/lib/mysql/slave-relay.log
relay-log-index = /var/lib/mysql/slave-relay-log.index
expire_logs_days = 14
max_binlog_size = 2048M


Master 2:

[mysqld]
binlog-format = row
server-id = 2
replicate-same-server-id = 0
auto-increment-increment = 2
auto-increment-offset = 2

master-host = &lt;master1_ip&gt;
master-user = slave_user
master-password = &lt;password&gt;
master-connect-retry = 60

log-bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
relay-log = /var/lib/mysql/slave-relay.log
relay-log-index = /var/lib/mysql/slave-relay-log.index
expire_logs_days = 14
max_binlog_size = 2048M

Assistant: This is how i did it for both masters

log-bin = mysqld-bin
binlog-ignore-db=test
binlog-ignore-db=information_schema
binlog-ignore-db=mysql
log-slave-updates
replicate-ignore-db=test
replicate-ignore-db=information_schema
replicate-ignore-db=mysql
relay-log=mysqld-relay-bin
