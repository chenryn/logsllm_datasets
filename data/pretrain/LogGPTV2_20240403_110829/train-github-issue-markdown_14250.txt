A lot of package maintainers are using the modular `lodash-node` instead of
full-fledged `lodash` in their projects to cut down on file size. With
`lodash-node`, they can import single functions rather than the entire module.
This is nice in some instances, but leads to a lot of duplication if one
project uses full-fledged `lodash` and another uses `lodash-node`.
What I'm wondering is this - is there a way I can use one of the Plugins to
replace `lodash-node` requires with properties on the `lodash` object? I'm
looking for something like:
`ReplacePlugin('lodash-node/modern/collections/forEach', 'lodash.forEach')`
Or even better:
`ReplacePlugin(/lodash-node\/modern\/collections\/(.*)(?:\.js)?$/,
'lodash.$1')`.
