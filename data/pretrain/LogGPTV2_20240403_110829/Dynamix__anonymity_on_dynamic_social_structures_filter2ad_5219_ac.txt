we observe that the unweighted graph model results in best entropy
(in all three categories: min, mean, and max)—Further details are

Combining All Scenarios. We consider all scenarios mentioned
above, for each of the datasets we had, and for a ﬁxed random
walk length to compare them relatively and draw ﬁnal conclusions
on the impact of the underlying social structure on the achieved
anonymity. We consider the random walk length ℓ = 10, and ex-
periment for both datasets to compute the entropy—both mean and
max. The results are shown in Figure 5 through Figure 6.
4.3 Analysis and Discussion
In most of the measurements of the entropy on the distribution
of the random walk after ℓ hops, we observe a relatively good en-
tropy which supports the claimed efﬁciency advocated in this work
and [14]. However, this entropy, for example is not as high in some
graphs, especially those the single snapshots that consider the graph
at one time period, and those resulting from assigning weights on
the graphs corresponding to the richness of the edges. This pattern
is shown in both datasets, which call for explanations.
One potential explanation of the relative difference between the
achieved entropy in the individual graphs and that obtained from
171the graphs computed using our dynamic graph model is the inherit
increment in the size of the resulting ﬁnal graph. For example,
while the largest DBLP graph is about 36,000 nodes, the ﬁnal graph
of the DBLP after using our model that considers graph dynamics
would result into about 44,000 nodes in the largest connected com-
ponents. This, and the fact that the graph becomes richer of more
edges that connect multiple components in the graph, improves the
mixing characteristics of the graph, which ultimately improves the
achieved entropy as ℓ increases.
This does not explain the difference between the achieved en-
tropy in both weighted and unweighted graphs, even for the graph
with the same number of nodes and edges. For example, when
ℓ = 10, the achieved entropy on DBLP-15 when weighted is 14
while it’s 14.5 for the same graph when it is unweighted—while
the difference in entropy is small, i.e., 0.5, the 14.5 bits of entropy
provide about 23, 170 anonymity set whereas only 16, 384 are pro-
vided for the other case, which translates to more than 6, 786 of dif-
ference in anonymity set. One possible explanation of this behavior
is the intuitive meaning of weighting graphs: by assigning weights
on edges, we are biasing the random walk on such graphs and fa-
voring a node over another of being reaching at any time when run-
ning the random walk. This is, some nodes are more likely reached
whereas other nodes while less likely reaching by the random walk
which deﬁnitely decreases the potential set of nodes being used as
a last hop in the random walk. This intuitive meaning explains the
difference in the entropy in both cases.
Unexpectedly, both entropy and anonymity sets are greatly de-
creased when using the weighted graphs that model dynamic struc-
ture. One possible explanation is that these weights are obtained
by favoring some edges over others, which is more meaningful
from an anonymity point of view, whereas edges in the unweighted
graph simply make all relationships over time equal. In a realistic
scenario, where potential insider attacker could exist to penetrate
the system to get communicated messages the social overlay, the
model, which considers links to be equal independent of their his-
tory or time of creation, could be problematic. Given this intuitive
explanation of weights associated with edges, one would antici-
pate the use of weighted graphs in real-world scenarios despite this
degradation in the achieved entropy and anonymity set sizes given
their potential for minimizing harms due to edge inﬁltration.
5. RELATED WORK
Exploiting static social networks for anonymous communication
has been explored in [14, 9, 4], some of which has been discussed
earlier, and all did not consider the dynamic graph case. Modeling
of dynamic social graph and extracting a deﬁnition for the mixing
time is done in [1], whereas sampling multigraph deﬁned as node
set union graphs is done in [5]. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work considered dynamic graphs in the context of the prob-
lem in hand and as per our method. On the other hand, other as-
sumptions in social network-based systems, like binary trust [10],
edge directionality [12], and expansion properties [11] are previ-
ously consider and challenged in separate studies.
Dynamic social graphs have been studied in [7, 17, 15, 16]. Most
of these studies, however, considered mining known simple prop-
erties of social graphs, but not the mixing time and patterns used
for anonymity. Finally, observing dynamics of social networks as
set of static graphs over time has been most recently used in [20].
6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper we considered the problem of building anonymous
communication systems on (unstructured) dynamic social graphs.
We have pointed out an interesting relationship between dynamic
structures and weighted graphs, and formalized the anonymity achieved
under dynamics as a random walk on weighted graphs. We formu-
lated the problem in hand, and shown the bounding distribution,
which captures the maximal achieved entropy of a random walk on
an anonymous communication system, which uses these dynamic
structures. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we have
shown the potential of these dynamic structures, and despite their
numerical disadvantage over unweighted versions, we have pointed
out their beneﬁts for anonymity for that they capture more mean-
ingful structure that represents stronger ties.
This work has considered “unstructured” social graphs, which a
non-constant (and likely power-law) degree distribution. On one
hand, the potential of structured graphs for anonymity is well stud-
ied, and beautiful theoretical results are already provided. On the
other hand, suitability of these results for real-world social struc-
tures, especially when considering dynamics, is unclear. In the fu-
ture, we will look at creating structured graphs from unstructured
social graphs, and explore their potential for anonymity systems.
