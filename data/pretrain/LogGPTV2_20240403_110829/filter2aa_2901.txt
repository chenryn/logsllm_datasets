## Introduction
> "The human race will begin solving its problems on the day that it ceases taking itself so seriously." - Malaclypse the Younger

## Scope, Context, and Prior Art

## The Dark Corners of Unicode
- **Comparison:**
  - ꓮ vs. ᴀ vs. A
- **Quiz Time:**
  - **Α**: Uppercase Greek Alpha (U+0391)
  - **ı̇**: Latin Small Letter Dotless I (U+0131) + Combining Dot Above (U+0307)
  - ** Mathematical Monospace Capital Z (U+1D689)
  - **₨**: Rupee Sign (U+20A8) (Not to be confused with **₹**: Indian Rupee Sign (U+20B9))
  - **ᚁ**: Ogham Letter Beith (U+1681)

## Let’s Hack Shit
### Search and Indexing
- **Do you want to play a game?**

### Defeating Plagiarism Detection
- **Lol text analysis**
- **Lol spellcheck**

### Lesson 1: Unicode Support
- **Observation:** Unicode support usually means "passed my unit tests."

### Defeating ML Systems
> "Explanations exist; they have existed for all time; there is always a well-known solution to every human problem [which is] neat, plausible, and wrong." - H. L. Mencken

- **Default Data Set**
- **Homographs in Training Sets:**
  - 100% Homographs in Negative Training
  - 10% Homographs in Negative Training

### Sabotaging a Cinematic Masterwork
- **Lesson 2:** ML overindexes on human-invisible patterns. If a human could see them, we wouldn’t be using ML.

### But Emojis Aren’t the Real Problem
- **Demo**

### Mitigation: Code Quality
- **Lesson 3:** Homographs work because people don’t actually see text; they see whatever it represents.

### Canary Traps and Repudiation
- **Canary Traps:** Because you want to know who’s “singing”
- **Homograph Bombs:**
  - Go ́ód ñ̃ evvs, h
  - cke
  - ₨
  - ⇥
  - ⇤

### And Now, for the World’s Most Boring Demo...
- **Tool Intro: samesame**
  - Because small, sharp tools are the best.

### Defense
> "Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world." - Arthur Schopenhauer

- **Demo Time!**
- **OCR Defense:**
  - Why do this instead of $alternative?

### Lesson 4: Defenses
- **Key Insight:** Defenses work best when they directly exploit attacker incentives.

## Conclusions
- **Phenomenology is king.**
- **Hacking computers is fun; hacking people is more effective.**
- **Unicode is a delightfully absurd monstrosity, and I love it.**

## Greetz
- **Amazon Colleagues:** Especially David Gabler and Nikki Parekh
- **The Additional Payphones Crew:** cibyr, cobells, giskard, dirac, and turbo
- **All the DefCon Organizers, Goons, and Other Crew**
