User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to find out, why a server hangs, but is still reachable with ping One of my servers, which runs in a german data center "hangs" every night, but i cant find out why. No errors are found in the /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog.

The server responds to ping, but all services are down (ssh, apache, ...). After a reset everything runs normal.

A hardware test has been performed. It looks like being a software issue.

Assistant: I'd leave some light profiling commands logging to files, so you can get an inside look on what went wrong after the fact. For example:

nohup top -b -d 60 &gt;&gt; top.log &amp; # runs every 60 seconds
nohup vmstat 5 &gt;&gt; vmstat.log &amp;
nohup iostat 5 &gt;&gt; iostat.log &amp;


nohup is there so they aren't killed when you lose connection to the server. You can also use screen for that.

A more robust alternative to the last two commands would be to setup sar.
