Consider following form:
        klickme
Form generated by CakePHP and Laravel automatically. This works the way that
when no radio button was selected or checkbox was checked a value from hidden
field with same `name` attribute used in POST and `getValue` method of
corresponding `FormField` in DomCrawler.
Right now this results in Fatal Error with radio button (because hidden field
which is discovered first in considered as radio button, when a radio button
with same name is found), see Behat/Mink#349:
    Fatal error: Call to undefined method Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Field\InputFormField::addChoice() in ./vendor/symfony/dom-crawler/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/Form.php on line 412
and has no effect (default value from hidden field isn't used), when we're
dealing with checkbox, see Behat/Mink#595 .
