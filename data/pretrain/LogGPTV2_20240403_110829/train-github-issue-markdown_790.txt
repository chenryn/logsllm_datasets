### Issue with Form Handling in CakePHP and Laravel

#### Problem Description
When using forms generated by CakePHP and Laravel, an issue arises when no radio button is selected or no checkbox is checked. In such cases, the value from a hidden field with the same `name` attribute is used in the POST request and the `getValue` method of the corresponding `FormField` in DomCrawler.

#### Current Behavior
- **Radio Button:**
  - When a radio button with the same `name` as a hidden field is found, the hidden field is incorrectly treated as a radio button.
  - This results in a fatal error:
    ```plaintext
    Fatal error: Call to undefined method Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Field\InputFormField::addChoice() in ./vendor/symfony/dom-crawler/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/Form.php on line 412
    ```

- **Checkbox:**
  - When a checkbox with the same `name` as a hidden field is not checked, the default value from the hidden field is not used.
  - This has no effect on the form submission.

#### Example Form
```html
<form>
    <input type="hidden" name="klickme" value="default_value">
    <input type="radio" name="klickme" value="option1"> Option 1
    <input type="radio" name="klickme" value="option2"> Option 2
    <input type="checkbox" name="klickme" value="check_me"> Check Me
</form>
```
