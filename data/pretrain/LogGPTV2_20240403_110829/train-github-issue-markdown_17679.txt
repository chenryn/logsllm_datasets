# Environment
    Windows build number: Version 1909 (OS Build 18363.836)
    PowerToys version: 0.81.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): uninstall
# Steps to reproduce
Just prior to uninstall I uninstalled several old and new Microsoft programs
including "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard", "Microsoft Office Suite", and
others. System bahavior was normal after these and I rebooted. Then...
uninstall via Control Panel  
"/" Programs  
"/" Programs and Features  
"/" Uninstall or change a program  
"->" PowerToys (Preview)  
"->" uninstall
# Expected behavior
uninstall successful
# Actual behavior
First attempt:
  1. three exceptions thrown resulting in dialog w/ execution addresses  
(sorry I did not capture these)
  2. continuing process, uninstall process crashed with no visible clue except associated windows all closed.
  3. PowerToys (Preview) still listed
Second attempt:
  1. uninstall process again crashed with no visible clue except associated windows all closed.
  2. Ran Task Manager and sorted processes according to CPU usage. There seemed to be about 5% extra overhead not seen before uninstall including system interrupts, churning of a few other normally quieter software... I have not idea if these are related to the uninstall or not.
