As per my stackoverflow question:
    import numpy as np
    a = np.zeros(4, dtype=np.dtype([('t', '<f8'), ('d', [('a', '<i4'), ('b', '<f8')], (100,))], align=True))
    b = np.require(a, requirements=['ALIGNED'])
    print([x.flags['ALIGNED'] for x in [a, b]])
prints `[False, False]` !
@charris writes that "The `recarray` class accepts an aligned parameter, but
looks to lose it in `format_parser`".
This bug breaks usage of PyOpenGL as per my other stackoverflow question.
As an aside why does "c-contiguous" imply "aligned" for recarray?
