Table 1: Final Cox regression results for all personnel. Nega-
tive coefﬁcients indicate stronger passwords. The exponential
of the coefﬁcient (exp(coef)) indicates how strongly that factor
being true affects the probability of being guessed over a con-
stant guessing range, compared to the baseline category. The
baseline category for gender is female and for college is ﬁne
arts. For example, the second line indicates that engineering
personnel are 80.4% as likely to have their passwords guessed
as ﬁne arts personnel. Results that are not statistically signiﬁ-
cant with p < 0.05 are grayed out and indicated by †.

women: men’s passwords are only 92% as likely as women’s to
be guessed at any point. Among colleges, users from the business
school are associated with the weakest passwords: 24% more likely
to be guessed than users in the arts school (the baseline in the re-
gression). Computer science users have the strongest passwords,
68% as likely as the arts school and 55% as likely as the business
school to be guessed. Every college except public policy is signiﬁ-
cantly different from the baseline. The full regression results, after
backward elimination, are shown in Table 1. No signiﬁcant inter-
actions between factors were found in the ﬁnal model, meaning the
effects of the various factors are independent.
Pairwise comparisons reveal science, engineering, and computer
science to be associated with stronger passwords than humanities,
business, and public policy; computer science is also associated
with stronger passwords than arts (all Holm-corrected Wilcoxon
test, p < 0.05). Figure 1 illustrates these relationships. Figure 2
shows guess number results by gender. Our ﬁndings agree with
Bonneau’s result that men’s passwords are slightly more resistant
to ofﬂine guessing [3].
It is perhaps equally interesting to note the factors that do not
appear in the ﬁnal regression, including age, primary campus, and
status as faculty, staff, or student. While we cannot positively con-

Table 2: Final Cox regression results for all participants, in-
cluding composition factors. For an explanation, see Table 1.
Adding composition factors seems to account for some of the re-
sults from Model 1. Gender is no longer a signiﬁcant factor, and
the effects of all colleges are reduced. This indicates that simple
password features such as length and the number and location of
special characters might partially explain differences in guessabil-
ity between these populations.
In this model, younger users are
associated with weaker passwords. This result agrees with that of
Bonneau [3], and is also fairly small: each additional year is esti-
mated to increase the likelihood of guessing by 0.5%.
We ﬁnd several signiﬁcant terms in the model with interactions
(Table 3). In most cases, these are superadditive interactions, where
two factors that were correlated with stronger passwords in the no-
interactions model are associated with a stronger-than-expected ef-
fect when combined. For example, having both digits and symbols
in the middle of a password has a much stronger impact on reducing
guessability than one would expect given a model with no interac-
tions — 35% as likely to be guessed. In contrast, two signiﬁcant
interactions are subadditive. First, adding lowercase when upper-
case characters are spread out is 25% less effective than one would
expect. While we do not have the data to investigate this particular
result, one possible explanation is that users are adding capitalized
words in predictable ways. Second, although additional digits and
lowercase letters are correlated with stronger passwords, the bene-
ﬁt of adding a letter decreases with each digit already present, and
vice versa. Passwords with more digits than average receive 3%
less beneﬁt than expected, per extra digit, from adding lowercase
letters. For example, if a password has three more digits than aver-
age, adding lowercase letters is 9% less effective than expected.
4.2.3 Model 3: Personnel with stable passwords
We next consider users who kept the same password throughout
the analysis period, for whom we have additional behavioral data.
In addition to college and gender, several behavioral factors corre-
late with password strength for these users. In the model without
interaction, we ﬁnd that users who make more password errors have
stronger passwords than other users, and users who log in more of-
ten have slightly weaker passwords (Table 4). An additional pass-
word error per login attempt is associated with a password only
Figure 2: The percentage of passwords guessed after a given
number of guesses (shown in log scale), by user gender.
Figure 3: The relative likelihoods of passwords with digits,
symbols, or uppercase letters in a given location being cracked.
For example, a password with all its digits at the end is ﬁve
times as likely to be cracked as a password with its digits spread
throughout, other things being equal. The values are derived
from the exponent of the regression coefﬁcient, for the non-
interaction model (Table 2). Each character class is normalized
independently.
clude that these factors have no association with password strength,
given our large sample size it seems likely that any effect is either a
small one or is accounted for by the other factors in the regression.
4.2.2 Model 2: All personnel plus composition
In this section, we ﬁnd that password composition is strongly
correlated with password strength. In the non-interaction model,
increasing the number of characters of any type is correlated with
stronger passwords (Table 2). With the addition of each lowercase
character or digit, a password becomes an estimated 70% as likely
to be guessed. Additional symbols and uppercase characters have
a stronger effect, reducing the likelihood of guessing to 56% and
46% per added character respectively. Placing digits and symbols
anywhere but at the end, which is the baseline for the regression, is
also correlated with stronger passwords. Multiple characters spread
out in more than one location are associated with the strongest pass-
words — only 20% and 30% as likely to be guessed as passwords
with digits and symbols, respectively, at the end. Placing upper-
case characters at the beginning instead of at the end of a pass-
word is associated with much weaker passwords: 88% more likely
to be guessed. Figure 3 illustrates the relative likelihood of being
guessed based on placement for each character class.
