User: Please analyze the following HTTP request response message to find possible problems. Request message: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com Connection: keep-alive Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,zh-CN;q=0.8,zh;q= 0.7 Response message: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu) Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 1024 Connection: keep-alive <!DOCTYPE html><html ><head><title>Example</title></head><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>
Assistant: Possible problems: 1. The User-Agent is not specified in the request message, and the server cannot determine the client type and version, which may affect the content returned by the server. 2. Cache-Control is not specified in the response message, which may lead to client caching problems. 3. The value of Content-Length is 1024, but the actual length of the content returned is the size of the entire HTML document. The data transmission may be incomplete or the browser cannot render the page correctly. 4. The response header Allow is not defined in the response message, which may cause the client to not know which HTTP methods the server supports. 5. If Last-Modified or ETag is not specified in the response message, the client cannot determine whether the resource has been modified, which may invalidate the cache policy.
