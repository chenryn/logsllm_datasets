I'm using reactstrap (bootstrap) together with react-responsive for my site's
responsive layout.  
There is no problem when I'm using reactstrap alone.
However, when I mix react-responsive into the pages to show certain components
only at certain screen breakpoints, I'm getting the following error in the
browser console:
> `main.js:4530 Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching  in
> .`
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The error should not be showing up in the browser console.
## Current Behavior
An error `main.js:4530 Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching
 in .` will appear in the console when ever a page is refreshed.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Use react-responsive to render a component when a smaller screen size is matched.
  2. Refresh page
  3. Error should will show up in console.
  4. The page however appears to still work normally.
## Context
I'm using reactstrap (bootstrap) together with react-responsive for my site's
responsive layout.
There is no problem when I'm using reactstrap alone.
However, when I mix react-responsive into the pages to show certain components
only at certain screen breakpoints, I'm getting the following error in the
browser's console:
> `main.js:4530 Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching  in
> .`
Removing the responsive component will get rid of this error message too.
Although I'm not certainly sure what's the cause, I'm suspecting this has to
do with the server side rendering. The mobile component was probably rendered
dynamically on client but not on server side.
Is there anything I can do to fix this error? Any impact if the error is left
unresolved?
