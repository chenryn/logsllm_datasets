### 5.1 Path Predicate and TaintPipe Performance

The path predicate restricts the symbolic memory index \( i \) to a specific range (e.g., 7 < \( i \) < 16). When this range is expanded, the overhead of TaintPipe increases slightly. Two primary factors limit TaintPipe's speedup:

1. **Taint Analysis Engine**: The taint analysis engine slows down when processing large code segments.
2. **Communication Latency**: As more worker threads are introduced, the communication latency for resolving symbolic taint states increases.

Based on our experimental results, we set the optimal values for these factors: a buffer size of 32MB and 16 worker threads. These settings will be used in the following experiments.

### 5.2 Performance Evaluation

To evaluate the performance gains achieved by pipelining taint logic, we compared TaintPipe with a state-of-the-art tool, libdft [20], which performs inlined dynamic taint analysis based on Pin. Additionally, we developed a simple tool to measure the slowdown imposed by the taint analysis.

The following figure illustrates the performance comparison across various applications. The results show that TaintPipe outperforms both nullpin and libdft in terms of overall execution time.

#### Figure: Performance Comparison

- **nullpin**: Baseline without taint analysis.
- **libdft**: State-of-the-art inlined dynamic taint analysis.
- **TaintPipe - application**: Execution time of the application under TaintPipe.
- **TaintPipe - overall**: Overall execution time including taint analysis.

| Average              | 13      | 7      | 6                       | 5                   |

In summary, TaintPipe demonstrates significant performance improvements over libdft and nullpin, making it a more efficient solution for dynamic taint analysis.
