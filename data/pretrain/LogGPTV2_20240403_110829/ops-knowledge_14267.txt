User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can You Prove a Chat Happened Online? With so much communication happening online nowadays the needs to verify information is obviously an essential.  However, let's say something was said in an online chat room/or private chat client, such as skype, and you need to share that information.  Is it possible to verify this information and present it to other people authentically?  Obviously screen shots and copy pastes of chats are not verifiable or reasonable for evidence.  Is there any way to implement a method of authenticating that a chat actually happened?

I'm thinking this is perhaps impossible with P2P clients like skype, as the server doesn't even have logs of the chat.  What then can you do?  Does anyone have any theories or ideas?

Assistant: One use of PGP is to provide message authentication; so if the chat messages were signed, you would have good confidence that the person on the other end has access to the corresponding private key.  The other party could still claim their key was stolen, however.
