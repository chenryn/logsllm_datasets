## Abstract
An IP darkspace is a globally routed IP address space with no active hosts. All traffic destined to darkspace addresses is unsolicited and often originates from network scanning or attacks. Sudden increases in different types of darkspace traffic can serve as indicators of new vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or large-scale attacks.

In our analysis, we leverage the fact that darkspace traffic typically originates from processes that use randomly chosen addresses or ports (e.g., scanning) or target specific addresses or ports (e.g., DDoS, worm spreading). These behaviors induce concentration or dispersion in feature distributions, which can be distinguished using entropy as a compact representation. Entropy's lightweight, unambiguous, and privacy-compatible nature makes it a suitable metric for facilitating early warning capabilities, operational information exchange among network operators, and comparison of analysis results across distributed IP darkspaces.

Using five months of traffic data from a large /8 darkspace monitor, we investigate the use of an entropy vector for classifying IP darkspace traffic. We perform an in-depth analysis with the tool iatmon [2] to classify the traffic into 15 different types. We then compare our entropy results to the detailed iatmon analysis.

### Entropy Calculation
We use the approach and formula presented in [3] to calculate an estimate of Shannon entropy from IP address and port number distributions:
\[ H(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{n_i}{S} \log_2 \left( \frac{n_i}{S} \right) \]
where \( n_i \) denotes the number of packets in bin \( i \), \( N \) is the total number of bins, and \( S \) is the total number of observations (packets received) in the time interval. For the /8 darkspace, there are \( N = 2^{24} \) possible destination addresses, so \( H(dIP)_{\text{max}} = 24 \).

For each time interval \( t \), we compute an entropy vector containing four entropy values:
\[ H_t = [H_t(sIP), H_t(dIP), H_t(sPort), H_t(dPort)] \]

### Event Signatures
- **Multi-Source Horizontal Scan:** Disperses source IPs and source ports but concentrates the destination port distribution. The expected entropy change is:
  \[ \Delta H_t = [+Δh, (+Δh), +Δh, -Δh] \]

- **Backscatter Traffic:** Concentrates the source IP and source port distributions while dispersing destination ports. The expected entropy change is:
  \[ \Delta H_t = [-Δh, (+Δh), -Δh, +Δh] \]

- **Distributed Probe:** Disperses source addresses and source ports and concentrates destination address and port. The expected entropy change is:
  \[ \Delta H_t = [+Δh, -Δh, +Δh, -Δh] \]

### Analysis
We analyze darkspace traffic from November 2008 (Conficker outbreak), January/February 2011, and January/February 2012. We first classify the traffic into 15 classes using iatmon [2]. Then, we calculate one entropy vector for each hour interval using the tool Corsaro<sup>1</sup> and the statistical package R<sup>2</sup>. We compare the detailed iatmon results with the entropy-based analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of entropy in classifying events.

#### Multi-Source Scans
The detailed iatmon analysis of November 2008 data reveals an increase in TCP horizontal scan packets due to the Conficker outbreak, where hosts began to scan port 445 to spread the worm [1]. The outbreak is clearly visible in the entropy vectors, following the expected pattern for a multi-source scan.

#### Backscatter
Backscatter traffic is effectively captured by the entropy vector. Figure 1 shows the results from February 2012, displaying the entropies and the amount of backscatter packets according to iatmon. As expected, an increase in backscatter leads to an increase in \( H(dPort) \), a decrease in \( H(sPort) \) and \( H(sIP) \), and no significant changes in \( H(dIP) \). Table 1 lists the correlation coefficients between entropy and backscatter traffic, confirming the expected behavior.

| Correlation Coefficients | Jan11 | Feb11 | Jan12 | Feb12 |
|-------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| bs, H(sIP)               | 0.44  | -0.38 | 0.39  | -0.60 |
| bs, H(sPort)             | 0.91  | -0.52 | 0.28  | 0.29  |
| bs, H(dIP)               | -0.83 | -0.37 | 0.14  | 0.62  |
| bs, H(dPort)             | 0.76  | -0.48 | 0.69  | 0.36  |
| bs, pktcount             | -0.75 | -0.58 | 0.48  | 0.69  |

#### Large Probing Events
Large probing events are also visible in entropy. The iatmon analysis for January 2011 shows a large distributed probe originating from many sources (spoofed and/or bots) directed to a specific IP address and port. The new probe traffic is clearly visible in the entropy statistics (Figure 2), with an increase in new sources driving up \( H(sIP) \) and high concentration of traffic to one address and one port causing \( H(dIP) \) and \( H(dPort) \) to drop significantly.

### Conclusion
Our results show that entropy-based metrics can reveal noteworthy events in IP darkspace. We plan to further investigate the use of entropy to detect smaller changes or nested events and evaluate its utility for early warning and privacy-respecting information sharing among darkspace operators.
