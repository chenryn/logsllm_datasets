User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to store user credentials in browser securely? I need help to authenticate users with user credentials.
We are using Angular 5 as a front-end &amp; need to store the user's email and password if the user checks on Remember Me. Then autofill user credentials after logout and refreshing the browser.
There are several ways to store user credentials (Cookies, Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, WebSQL). but these all are not secure.
we thought about storing user credentials in localStorage by encrypting it, but anyone can decrypt it so, this way is not secure.
Our targeted browser includes Internet Explorer, MS Edge, Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla Firefox.
How can we achieve client-side web storage using JavaScript?

Assistant: Anything stored client side (and not encrypted) can be seen and/or modified by the user.

The usual way of implementing a "Remember Me" functionality is to set a cookie with an encrypted username, sent from the server.

The server will encrypt the username with a secret key, known only to the server, and set a cookie with that value.  When the server later receives that cookie, it can try to decrypt it, and if successful, log the user in.  This cannot be tampered with by the user, as they do not know the secret key.
