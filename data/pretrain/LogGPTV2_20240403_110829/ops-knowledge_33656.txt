User: I'm trying to get a package installed on Google App Engine.  The package relies rather extensively on pkg_resources, but there's no way to run setup.py on App Engine.
There's no platform-specific code in the source, however, so it's no problem to just zip up the source and include those in the system path.  And I've gotten a version of pkg_resources installed and working as well.
The only problem is getting the package actually registered with pkg_resources so when it calls iter_entry_points it can find the appropriate plugins.
What methods do I need to call to register modules on sys.path with all the appropriate metadata, and how do I figure out what that metadata needs to be?
Assistant: Create a setup.py for the package just as you would normally, and then use "setup.py sdist --formats=zip" to build your source zip.  The built source zip will include an .egg-info metadata directory, which will then be findable by pkg_resources.  Alternately, you can use bdist_egg for all your packages.
