Question: "In an Android system, version binding has been implemented to enhance the security of keys used by applications. If an attacker were to discover a vulnerability in a previous version of the system, why is it still challenging for them to exploit this vulnerability using the keys created with a newer version?"
 "A": "Because the keys are bound to the operating system version and are invalidated if the device is rolled back to a vulnerable version."
 "B": "Because the keys automatically upgrade to stronger cryptographic algorithms whenever a new vulnerability is discovered."
 "C": "Because all keys are permanently deleted if a vulnerability is discovered, thus preventing any misuse."
 "D": "Because key attestation prevents the use of keys if any vulnerability is detected, irrespective of the system version."
Answer: A
