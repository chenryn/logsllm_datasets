# G0007: APT28
## Description
APT28, also known as [APT28](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007), is a threat group that has been attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the Russian General Staff. This attribution was made in a July 2018 U.S. Department of Justice indictment. The group is reported to have compromised the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) in 2016, with the intent of interfering with the U.S. presidential election. APT28 has been active since at least 2004.

## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
| Platform | Tactic | Technique | Description | Data Sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion | Hidden Window | APT28 has used the `WindowStyle` parameter to conceal PowerShell windows. | Windows event logs, PowerShell logs, Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring, File monitoring |
| SaaS, Office 365, Azure AD | Credential Access | Steal Application Access Token | APT28 has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens, including those masquerading as "Google Defender," "Google Email Protection," and "Google Scanner" for Gmail users, and "Delivery Service" and "McAfee Email Protection" for Yahoo users. | Azure activity logs, OAuth audit logs |
| SaaS, Office 365 | Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement | Application Access Token | APT28 has used several malicious applications that abused OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts, including Gmail and Yahoo Mail. | OAuth audit logs, Office 365 account logs |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Command and Control | Commonly Used Port | APT28 has used port 443 for C2. | Packet capture, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Process use of network, Process monitoring |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Command and Control | Custom Cryptographic Protocol | APT28 installed a Delphi backdoor that used a custom algorithm for C2 communications. | Packet capture, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Process use of network, Malware reverse engineering, Process monitoring |
| Windows | Defense Evasion | Template Injection | APT28 used weaponized Microsoft Word documents abusing the remote template function to retrieve a malicious macro. | Anti-virus, Email gateway, Network intrusion detection system, Web logs |
| Linux, Windows, macOS | Execution | Exploitation for Client Execution | APT28 has exploited the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0262 for execution. | Anti-virus, System calls, Process monitoring |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion | Rootkit | APT28 has used a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) rootkit known as LoJax. | BIOS, MBR, System calls |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Collection | Automated Collection | APT28 used a publicly available tool to gather and compress multiple documents on the DCCC and DNC networks. | File monitoring, Data loss prevention, Process command-line parameters |
| Windows, Office 365 | Collection | Email Collection | APT28 has collected emails from victim Microsoft Exchange servers. | Office 365 trace logs, Mail server, Email gateway, Authentication logs, File monitoring, Process monitoring, Process use of network |
| Windows, macOS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS | Initial Access | Spearphishing Link | APT28 sent spearphishing emails using a URL-shortener service to masquerade as a legitimate service and redirect targets to credential harvesting sites. | Packet capture, Web proxy, Email gateway, Detonation chamber, SSL/TLS inspection, DNS records, Mail server |
| Linux, Windows, macOS | Exfiltration | Data Compressed | APT28 used a publicly available tool to gather and compress multiple documents on the DCCC and DNC networks. | Binary file metadata, File monitoring, Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Execution | Command-Line Interface | APT28 uses `cmd.exe` to execute commands and custom backdoors. | Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, Windows, macOS, AWS, GCP, Azure, SaaS | Initial Access | Trusted Relationship | Once APT28 gained access to the DCCC network, the group used that access to compromise the DNC network. | Azure activity logs, Stackdriver logs, AWS CloudTrail logs, Application logs, Authentication logs, Third-party application logs |
