User: Provide a network security solution, including firewall configuration and intrusion detection system
Assistant: Network security solution: 1. Firewall configuration: 1.1 Set global rules: allow only necessary network traffic to pass through, such as social media, online shopping, etc.; deny traffic from unknown sources, malware traffic, and IP address traffic in the blacklist. 1.2 Configure inbound rules: block all unnecessary inbound access, and limit allowed source IP addresses, ports, and protocols. 1.3 Configure outbound rules: restrict internal systems from accessing external systems, and restrict internal users from accessing dangerous websites, especially those that may contain malware or dangerous scripts. 1.4 Combined use of firewall and intrusion detection: use the network traffic monitoring system and intrusion detection system together with the firewall to detect and deal with abnormal traffic in time. 2. Intrusion detection system: 2.1 Black and white list mechanism: establish a black list mechanism to prevent source IP addresses from being connected, and add blacklist operations to illegal attackers. Establish a whitelist mechanism to authenticate access to hosts and IP addresses. 2.2 Network monitoring function: establish network monitoring and real-time monitoring for key assets, such as databases and system files, to prevent secret theft and malicious damage in time. 2.3 Log management: manage user logs, operation logs, system logs, etc., and regularly clean up junk logs to prevent attackers from obtaining valuable information. 2.4 Risk management: establish a risk management mechanism, analyze information obtained from logs, especially security events, formulate appropriate disposal measures, and investigate and deal with intruders in a timely manner. To sum up, the network security scheme should be comprehensive, including firewall configuration and intrusion detection. The firewall configuration should be adjusted based on the actual needs of the enterprise and used in combination with the intrusion detection system to discover and respond to security risks in a timely manner. Enterprises should carry out network risk assessment work on a regular basis, and constantly improve and enhance the network security system.
