### Configuration Guidelines for Port Mirroring and Analyzers

#### Number of Concurrently Enabled Analyzers
- **256**: EX3200, EX4200, EX4500, EX4550, and EX6200 switches.
- **1**: EX2200, EX3200, EX4200, EX3300, and EX6200 switches.
- **7 (port-based or 1 global)**: EX4500 and EX4550 switches.
- **7 total (with one based on a VLAN, firewall filter, or LAG and the remaining 6 based on firewall filters)**: EX8200 switches.

**Note**: 
- You can configure more than the specified number of analyzers on the switch, but only the specified number can be enabled concurrently.
- Use the command `disable ethernet-switching-options analyzer name` to disable an analyzer.

#### Exceptions and Special Cases
- **EX8200 Switches**: An analyzer configured using a firewall filter does not support mirroring of egressing packets.
- **EX4550 Virtual Chassis**: Only one analyzer can be configured if ports in the input and output definitions are on different switches in the Virtual Chassis. To configure multiple analyzers, the entire session must be on the same switch within the Virtual Chassis.
- **EX4500 and EX4550 Switches**: If you configure multiple analyzers, none of them can be attached to a firewall filter.

#### Types of Ports Where Traffic Cannot Be Mirrored
- Virtual Chassis ports (VCPs)
- Management Ethernet ports (me0 or vme0)
- Routed VLAN interfaces (RVIs)
- VLAN-tagged Layer 3 interfaces

#### Traffic Directions and Ratios
- **Ingress Only**: EX8200 switches.
- **Ingress and Egress**: All other switches.

#### Protocol Families
- **EX8200 Switches**: Any except inet and inet6 (inet and inet6 can be used in local analyzers).
- **All Other Switches**: Any protocol family.

#### Traffic Directions for Firewall-Filter-Based Configurations
- **Ingress Only**: All switches.

#### Mirrored Packets on Tagged Interfaces
- **EX2200 Switches**: Both VLAN ID and Ethertype.
- **EX3200 and EX4200 Switches**: VLAN ID only.
- **EX4500 and EX4550 Switches**: Ethertype only.
- **EX8200 Switches**: Does not apply.

#### CoS DSCP or 802.1p Bits
- **All Switches**: Mirrored packets exiting an interface do not reflect rewritten class-of-service (CoS) DSCP or 802.1p bits.

#### Incorrect 802.1Q Header
- **EX8200 Switches**: The analyzer appends an incorrect 802.1Q (dot1q) header to mirrored packets on routed traffic or does not mirror any packets on the routed traffic when an egress VLAN that belongs to a routed VLAN interface (RVI) is configured as the input for that analyzer.
- **Workaround**: Configure an analyzer that uses each port (member interface) of the VLAN as egress input.

#### Physical Layer Errors
- **All Switches**: Packets with physical layer errors are filtered out and not sent to the local or remote analyzer.

#### Layer 3 Interface Configuration
- **EX8200 Switches**: Port mirroring configuration on a Layer 3 interface with the output configured to a VLAN is not available.
- **All Other Switches**: This restriction does not apply.

#### Line-Rate Traffic
- **All Switches**: Port mirroring does not support line-rate traffic. Mirroring is done on a best-effort basis.

#### EX8200 Virtual Chassis
- **LAG as Monitor Port**: 
  - **Native Analyzers**: LAG can be configured as a monitor port.
  - **Firewall-Filter-Based Analyzers**: LAG cannot be configured as a monitor port.
  - **VLAN in Input Definition**: If LAG is a monitor port, VLAN cannot be configured in the input definition.

#### Standalone EX8200 Switches
- **LAG as Monitor Port**:
  - **Both Native and Firewall-Filter-Based Analyzers**: LAG can be configured as a monitor port.
  - **VLAN in Input Definition**: If LAG is a monitor port, VLAN cannot be configured in the input definition.

### Port Mirroring on SRX Series Firewalls
Port mirroring copies packets entering or exiting a port and sends the copies to a local interface for monitoring. It is used for purposes such as compliance monitoring, policy enforcement, intrusion detection, traffic pattern analysis, event correlation, and more. You can mirror all packets or only sampled packets on either the incoming (ingress) or outgoing (egress) port.

**Supported I/O Cards**:
- SRX1K-SYSIO-GE
- SRX1K-SYSIO-XGE
- SRX3K-SFB-12GE
- SRX3K-2XGE-XFP
- SRX5K-FPC-IOC Flex I/O

**Notes**:
- All packets passing through the mirrored port are copied and sent to the specified mirror-to port, which must be on the same Broadcom chipset in the I/O cards.
- Port mirroring works on physical interfaces only.

### Understanding Layer 2 Port Mirroring
Layer 2 port mirroring allows you to send a copy of incoming packets from the routing platform or switch to an external host address or packet analyzer for analysis. MX Series and EX Series switches support this feature for various types of traffic, including Layer 2 bridging, VPLS, and Layer 2 VPN over CCC.

**Packet-Selection Properties**:
- **Number of Packets in Each Sample**
- **Number of Packets to Mirror from Each Sample**
- **Length to Which Mirrored Packets Are Truncated**

**Packet Address Family**:
- **ethernet-switching**: For mirroring VPLS traffic.
- **ccc**: For mirroring Layer 2 VPN traffic.
- **vpls**: For mirroring VPLS traffic.

**Mirror Destination Properties**:
- **Physical Interface for Sending Selected Packets**
- **Filter Checking**: By default, filter checking is enabled on all interfaces. If a filter is applied to a Layer 2 port-mirroring destination, filter checking must be disabled to avoid commit failures.

**Mirror-Once Option**:
- Prevents duplicate packets from being sent to the same destination when port mirroring is enabled at both ingress and egress interfaces.

### Application of Layer 2 Port Mirroring Types
- **Global Instance**: Applies to all ports in the chassis.
- **Named Instance**: Applies to ports grouped at the FPC or PIC level.
- **Firewall Filter**: Applies to logical interfaces and includes specific actions and modifiers.

### Restrictions on Layer 2 Port Mirroring
- **Only Layer 2 Transit Data**: Local data (e.g., control packets) is not mirrored.
- **Unicast Packets Only**: If a port-mirroring filter is applied to the output of a logical interface.
- **Dedicated VLAN for Mirror Destination**: The mirror destination device should not participate in any bridging activity.
- **One Mirror Output Interface per Instance**: Multiple interface statements under the family output statement will override previous ones.
- **No Support for Logical Systems**: Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filtering is not supported for logical systems.
- **Load Balancing**: Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters do not support next-hop subgroups for load-balancing mirrored traffic.
