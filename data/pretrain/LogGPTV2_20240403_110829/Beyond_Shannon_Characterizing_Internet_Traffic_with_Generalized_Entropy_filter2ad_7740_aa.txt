## Abstract
Tracking changes in feature distributions is crucial for network anomaly detection. However, these distributions often consist of thousands or even millions of data points, making it challenging to track, store, and visualize changes over time. A common approach to capture and describe distributions compactly is through Shannon entropy analysis, which has been extensively studied and applied successfully in anomaly detection. Nevertheless, reducing the information about a distribution to a single number can lead to the loss of important details, such as the nature of the change, or may overlook significant anomalies. In this paper, we demonstrate that a generalized form of entropy, which explores different moments, is better suited for capturing changes in traffic features. We introduce the Traffic Entropy Spectrum (TES) to analyze changes in traffic feature distributions and show its ability to characterize the structure of anomalies using traffic traces from a large ISP.

## 1. Introduction
Fast and accurate detection of network traffic anomalies is essential for maintaining a reliable and stable network infrastructure. Various advanced methods and tools have been developed to improve alerting and visualization systems. Some focus on volume metrics like traffic volume, connection count, or packet count [1], while others analyze changes in traffic feature distributions [2] or inspect content and host behavior [3]. However, content inspection and per-host state storage are typically limited to small- and medium-scale networks. For large-scale networks, most approaches reduce input data by focusing on flow-level information (e.g., Cisco NetFlow [4] or IPFIX [5]) and use on-the-fly methods that do not rely on extensive stored state information. This approach, however, is less effective for tracking the history of traffic feature distributions, and visualizing the evolution of IP address or flow size distributions over time becomes challenging due to the large number of data points.

Entropy analysis is a prominent method for capturing important characteristics of distributions in a compact form. It reduces the amount of information needed to detect distributional changes and allows for a compact visualization of these changes. Studies have shown that methods based on Shannon entropy can capture relevant changes [6,7,8].

In this paper, we propose a new method for capturing and visualizing important characteristics of network activity using generalized entropy metrics. Our contributions include:
- Defining the Traffic Entropy Spectrum (TES) for capturing and visualizing important characteristics with little or no tuning to specific attacks.
- Demonstrating that TES can be used not only for detecting anomalies but also for characterizing and visualizing their nature.
- Providing evidence that Autonomous System (AS) entropy complements IP address entropy.
- Confirming the findings of Ziviani et al. [9] for a broader set of anomalies.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews Tsallis entropy and discusses its advantages over Shannon entropy. We then introduce the TES and explain how it captures and visualizes distributional changes. Section 3 describes the methodology used for evaluation. Section 4 presents the results and outlines how TES can be used to build a detector with integrated anomaly classification. Section 5 discusses related work, and Section 6 summarizes the results.

## 2. The Tsallis Entropy
Shannon entropy \( S_s(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \cdot \log_2(p_i) \) [10] can be seen as a logarithmic moment, representing the expectation of the logarithm of the measure. Different moments reveal different aspects of the distribution, and using other generalized entropies can provide additional insights. Two such generalized entropies are the Renyi and Tsallis entropies, with the latter being an extension of the former. We use the Tsallis entropy:

\[
S_q(X) = \frac{1}{q - 1} \left( 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i^q \right)
\]

Tsallis entropy has a direct interpretation in terms of moments of order \( q \) and has been extensively studied [11,12,13,14,15]. It is better suited for non-Gaussian measures, which are common in Internet traffic [16,17,2], while Shannon's entropy is more adapted to Normal distributions.

### 2.1 Meaning of the Parameter \( q \)
The parameter \( q \) in Tsallis entropy determines which aspects of the distribution are emphasized. Each value of \( q \) reveals different characteristics of the system under study. Before discussing the meaning of \( q \), we define the following terms:
- **System:** A (set of) network(s) described by an ensemble of network flows.
- **Feature:** Any flow property that takes on different values and whose characterization using a distribution is potentially useful (e.g., source and destination IP addresses, ports, and Autonomous Systems).
- **Element \( i \):** A specific instance of a feature (e.g., source IP address 10.0.0.1).
- **Activity \( a_i \):** The number of occurrences of element \( i \) within a time slot of size \( T \) (slot sizes used: 5, 10, and 15 minutes).
- **Feature distribution:** The probability distribution \( P[I = i] = p_i = \frac{a_i}{\sum_j a_j} \) (e.g., for the feature source port). \( p_i \) can also be interpreted as the relative activity of \( i \).

For \( q = 0 \), we get \( n - 1 \), the number of elements in the feature distribution minus one. For \( q = 1 \), the Tsallis entropy corresponds to the Shannon entropy. For other values of \( q \):
- High activity: Emphasizes high-activity elements for \( q > 1 \).
- Medium activity: Reduces entropy for \( -1 < q < 1 \) when the number of elements decreases.
- Low activity: Increases entropy for \( q < -1 \) when the activity of some elements decreases.

### 2.2 The Traffic Entropy Spectrum
To leverage the full capabilities of Tsallis entropy, we introduce the Traffic Entropy Spectrum (TES). TES is a three-axis plot that shows the entropy value over time (first axis) and for several values of \( q \) (second axis). The third axis (showing normalized entropy values) can be mapped to a color range. TES illustrates the temporal dynamics of feature distributions, ranging from very low activity elements for negative \( q \) to high activity elements for \( q > 1 \).

We found that selecting \( q = -2, -1.75, \ldots, 1.75, 2 \) provides sufficient information to detect network anomalies across various traffic characteristics. Figure 1 shows the impact of changes to different regions of the distribution.

## 3. Methodology
For anomaly detection with real traffic traces, we calculated the TES for the activity of the following flow features: Source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and origin and destination Autonomous Systems, separately for TCP, UDP, ICMP, and OTHERS protocols.

### 3.1 Calculating the TES
We aggregated the sample distribution of the various traffic features over intervals of 5, 10, and 15 minutes. While 15-minute intervals provide smoother results, shorter intervals are better for detecting anomalies lasting tens of seconds or a few minutes. At the end of each interval, we calculated the Tsallis entropy values for the different \( q \) values and stored them for TES visualization.

After calculating the TES, we applied two normalization methods:
- **Global normalization:** Using the maximum and minimum entropy values for a given \( q \) during the observation period.
- **Normalization using training day:** Mapping entropy values between the minimum and maximum of a training day to [0,1].

The TES based on global normalization is used to identify dominating changes, while the second normalization helps assess whether changes stay within the variations of the training day. This simple method is sufficient for detecting and classifying critical anomalies in network traces.

### 3.2 Anomaly Characterization
Malicious attacks often exhibit specific traffic characteristics that induce changes in heavy-tailed feature distributions. For example, DDoS attacks involve a single victim and many attackers, leading to concentration in the high-activity domain. Random feature selection, such as spoofed IP addresses, impacts the low-activity domain. By profiling these changes, we can classify the type of attack.

## 4. Application on Network Traces
We used data captured from the five border routers of the Swiss Academic and Research Network (SWITCH, AS 559), a medium-sized backbone operator. The SWITCH IP address range contains about 2.4 million IP addresses, with traffic volumes varying between 60 and 140 million NetFlow records per hour. We analyzed five well-understood events:
- **Refl. DDoS:** A reflector DDoS attack involving 30,000 reflectors within the SWITCH network (April 2008).
- **DDoS 1:** A short (10 min.) DDoS attack on a router and a host with 8 million spoofed source addresses (Sept. 2007).
- **DDoS 2:** A long (13h) DDoS attack on a host with 5 million spoofed source addresses (Dec. 2007/Jan. 2008).
- **Blaster Worm:** A massive global worm outbreak (Aug. 2003).
- **Witty Worm:** A fast-spreading worm (March 2004).

### 4.1 Patterns in Real Traffic
We analyzed the spectrum patterns exhibited by the attacks. For describing these patterns, we use a shorthand notation representing the state of \( S_q \) with respect to the thresholds:
- ‘+’ if \( S_q \geq \max S_q \) of the training day (positive alert)
- ‘-’ if \( S_q \leq \min S_q \) of the training day (negative alert)
- ‘0’ otherwise (normal conditions)
