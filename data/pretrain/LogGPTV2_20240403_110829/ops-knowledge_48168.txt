User: I've done a lot of development in rails, and am looking into developing projects using python & app engine.
From the demo project and what I've seen so far, I've got a question/concern about app engine projects:
How is data migration handled in app-engine? For example, if I change the name of an entity/table (ex: Texts to Documents), or change a column in an existing table (ex: age to dob) - how does it handle old data when this happens?
Thanks!
Assistant: You can't change the name of an entity. It's not permitted. 
If you change the name of an attribute in a model (please don't call them columns), AppEngine will ignore the old data in the old field, and return None for the new field.
