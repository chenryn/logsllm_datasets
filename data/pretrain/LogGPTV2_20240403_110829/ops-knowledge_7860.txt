User: Can you please tell how to install curl for python 3.x to Windows 7. Ease_install only for the 2 version of the sort.
Assistant: There is no module called "curl", so it's unclear what you mean?

PycURL? 
friendly_curl? 
pylibcurl?
curlwrapper?
pyparallelcurl?

In any case, as far as I can gather, none of them are ported to Python 3, so the answer on how to install them on Python 3 is: Talk to the authors and help port them! It's fun!
