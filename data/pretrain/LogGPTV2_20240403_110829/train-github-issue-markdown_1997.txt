### Issue Description

When debugging my Flutter application on Visual Studio Code (VSC) for iOS, approximately 60-80% of the time, the app launches to a white screen and then fails without displaying any error messages. Here is the detailed log output:

```plaintext
Launching lib/main.dart on Luke's iPhone in debug mode...
Automatically signing iOS for device deployment using specified development team in Xcode project: TA8U33SGB8
Xcode build done.                                           13.9s
5.4.0 - [Firebase/Core][I-COR000003] The default Firebase app has not yet been configured. Add `[FIRApp configure];` (`FirebaseApp.configure()` in Swift) to your application initialization. Read more: https://goo.gl/ctyzm8.
5.4.0 - [Firebase/Analytics][I-ACS023007] Firebase Analytics v.50001000 started
5.4.0 - [Firebase/Analytics][I-ACS023008] To enable debug logging set the following application argument: -FIRAnalyticsDebugEnabled (see http://goo.gl/RfcP7r)
5.4.0 - [Firebase/Messaging][I-FCM001000] FIRMessaging Remote Notifications proxy enabled, will swizzle remote notification receiver handlers. If you'd prefer to manually integrate Firebase Messaging, add "FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled" to your Info.plist, and set it to NO. Follow the instructions at:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client#method_swizzling_in_firebase_messaging
to ensure proper integration.

### Verbose Output from `flutter run --verbose`

When running `flutter run --verbose`, the following tail end of the log is observed:

### `flutter doctor` Output

Here is the output from `flutter doctor`:

### Summary

- **Issue**: The app frequently launches to a white screen and fails without an error message.
- **Log Details**: The logs indicate a potential issue with Firebase configuration and a connection reset error during the file synchronization process.
- **Environment**: The development environment is set up correctly, as indicated by `flutter doctor`.

### Next Steps

1. **Check Firebase Configuration**: Ensure that Firebase is properly configured in your `AppDelegate` or `main.m` file. Add the necessary configuration as suggested in the logs.
2. **Debug Logging**: Enable debug logging for Firebase Analytics to get more detailed information.
3. **Connection Reset**: Investigate the cause of the `SocketException: OS Error: Connection reset by peer` error, which may be related to network issues or device connectivity.
4. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies, including Flutter and Firebase, are up to date.

If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the Flutter community or filing a bug report with the detailed logs provided.
