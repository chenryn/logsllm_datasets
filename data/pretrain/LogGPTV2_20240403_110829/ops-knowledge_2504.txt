User: I use vim for coding and for python coding in particular. Often I want to execute the current buffer with python interpreter. (for example to run unittests), usually I do this with :!python % <Enter> 
This scenatio will work works fine with global python, but I want to run virtualenv python instead. How do I enable virtualenv within vim? Is it possible to switch virtualenv on the runtime?
I'm using macvim
Assistant: Activate your virtualenv before starting vim. You will automatically get the corresponding interpreter instance.
