## Expected Behavior
Should display correct string.
## Current Behavior
Displays `[Object object]`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I am using react-int library for internalisation, it woks really well with
material-ui and only fails at placeholders i.e
    }
      placeholder={}
      fullWidth
      margin="dense"
      value={email}
      onChange={({ target }) => this.setState({ email: target.value })}
    />
placeholder is displayed as `[Object object]`, this works fine for `label` in
same field and things like Tabs.
## Context
Unable to internationalise placeholders properly.
