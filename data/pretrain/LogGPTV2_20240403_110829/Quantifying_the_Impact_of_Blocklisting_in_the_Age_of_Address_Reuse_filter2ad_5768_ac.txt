are many other techniques for detecting reused addresses. The
only technique that can be reproduced at scale is Cai et al. [13].
We use their techniques and the datasets (IT86c and IT89w) that
most closely match our monitoring periods to compare dynamic
addresses. Figure 6 (black line) shows the number of blocklisted
addresses that overlap with their study. Cai et al. have broader
coverage in some blocklists compared to this study; this is likely
due to the absence of RIPE Atlas probes in those address regions.
We find that the total number of listings discovered by Cai et al.
is roughly the same as our technique: they detect 29.8K listings
compared to 30.6K listings using our technique.
6 UNDERSTANDING BLOCKLISTS USAGE
We survey 65 network operators (see Appendix A for the full sur-
vey), on how they use blocklists to identify malicious traffic, the
role blocklists play in traffic filtering, and their perceptions of limi-
tations of blocklists due to reused addresses. Our survey indicates
that 85% of respondents use blocklists, and 59% of respondents use
blocklists to directly block malicious traffic (Table 1). 34 survey par-
ticipants responded to direct questions about the impact of reused
addresses. Of these, 56% believe that blocklists are inaccurate due to
NAT and 76% believe dynamic addressing introduces inaccuracies.
From these responses as well as open-ended comments made within
the survey, it is evident that network operators use blocklists and
are aware of unjust blocking caused by reused addresses.
We make our crawler and scripts to determine reused addresses
public3. We believe that our lists can assist network operators in
many ways. Depending on the blocklist type, a network operator
could take necessary action on their incoming traffic with our list.
For instance, operators that use DDoS blocklists to reduce intensity
of the attacker should block all traffic listed in DDoS blocklists,
even if there is collateral damage due to reused addresses. On the
other hand, network operators using application-specific blocklists
(such as spam blocklist) that require more accuracy, can use our list
to implement greylisting [46], which is already built into popular
spam filtering systems like Spamassassin [74] or Spamd [14].
Our lists can also provide incentives to blocklist maintainers to
maintain more accurate blocklists. They may identify malicious
reused IP addresses in a separate greylist to their customers. Finally,
our lists can assist services such as Google or Cloudflare, to warn
users that their IP address is reused along a compromised device.
This could help users to clean up their home network, or even
request help from their ISP to identify other compromised users.
7 CONCLUSION
We present two techniques to identify reused addresses and analyze
151 publicly available IPv4 blocklists to quantify their impact. We
find 53–60% of blocklists list at least one reused address. We also
find 30.6K–45.1K listings of reused addresses in blocklists. Reused
addresses can be present in blocklists for as long as 44 days affecting
as much as 78 users. Finally, to assist blocklist maintainers to reduce
unjust blocking, we made our discovered reused addresses public.
