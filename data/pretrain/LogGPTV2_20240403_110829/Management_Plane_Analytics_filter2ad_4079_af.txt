Figure 12: Characterization of conﬁguration changes
Lastly, we look at change events, both in terms of how many
there are in a network as well as the composition of an event (in
terms of number of devices changed). Figure 12(e) shows a distri-
bution of the number of change events. They are few in number
(O(10)) in most networks (80%); however about 5% of the net-
works experience tens if not hundreds of change events in a month.
We see a similar diversity in the number of change events involving
middleboxes (Figure 13(b)). Both prevalence of change events, as
well as events involving middleboxes, were ﬂagged by the opera-
tors we surveyed as being impactful (Figure 2).
Figure 13(a) shows a CDF of the average number of devices
changed per change event. Most change events we see across net-
works are small: in about half of the networks, a change event af-
fects only one or two devices (on average). Further, in almost all
networks, the average change event affects only one device role and
