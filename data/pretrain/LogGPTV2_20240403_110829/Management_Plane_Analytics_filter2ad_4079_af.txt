It appears that the provided text is a mix of graphical elements and textual descriptions, likely from a research paper or technical report. To improve the clarity, coherence, and professionalism of this content, I will restructure it into a more organized format, separating the figures and their descriptions. Here is the optimized version:

### Characterization of Design Practices

**Figure 11: Characterization of Design Practices**

- **X-Axis:** Month
- **Y-Axis:** Fraction of Devices Changed
- **Legend:**
  - `‚óè` represents different categories (e.g., `iface`, `pool`, `acl`, `router`, `user`)

**Description:**
The figure shows the fraction of devices changed over time for various categories. The data points are plotted monthly, and the fraction of changes ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.

- **Key Observations:**
  - The fraction of changes varies across different categories.
  - Some categories show a higher frequency of changes compared to others.
  - The changes are relatively consistent over time, with some fluctuations.

### Characterization of Configuration Changes

**Figure 12: Characterization of Configuration Changes**

- **(a) Average Changes per Month:**
  - **X-Axis:** Number of Change Events
  - **Y-Axis:** Fraction of Networks
  - **Description:**
    - The distribution of the number of change events in a network.
    - Most networks experience a small number of change events (O(10)) in a month.
    - About 5% of the networks experience tens or even hundreds of change events in a month.

- **(b) Average Number of Devices Changed per Event:**
  - **X-Axis:** Mean Devices Changed/Event
  - **Y-Axis:** Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
  - **Description:**
    - The CDF of the average number of devices changed per change event.
    - In about half of the networks, a change event affects only one or two devices on average.
    - In almost all networks, the average change event affects only one device role and one device model.

- **(c) Most Frequent Configuration Changes:**
  - **X-Axis:** Categories (e.g., `iface`, `pool`, `acl`, `router`, `user`)
  - **Y-Axis:** Fraction of Changes
  - **Description:**
    - The most frequent configuration changes across different categories.
    - Some categories, such as `iface` and `router`, show a higher frequency of changes.

- **(d) Fraction of Automated Changes:**
  - **X-Axis:** Fraction of Changes
  - **Y-Axis:** Number of Networks
  - **Description:**
    - The fraction of changes that are automated.
    - The automation level varies, with some networks having a higher percentage of automated changes.

- **(e) Average Number of Change Events per Month:**
  - **X-Axis:** Number of Change Events
  - **Y-Axis:** Fraction of Networks
  - **Description:**
    - The distribution of the number of change events per month.
    - Similar to (a), most networks have a small number of change events, but a few networks have a significantly higher number.

### Characterization of Configuration Change Events

**Figure 13: Characterization of Configuration Change Events**

- **(a) Average Devices Changed per Event:**
  - **X-Axis:** Mean Devices Changed/Event
  - **Y-Axis:** Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
  - **Description:**
    - The CDF of the average number of devices changed per change event.
    - Most change events affect only one or two devices on average.
    - Limiting changes to a few, similar devices is a good practice to simplify debugging and rollback.

- **(b) Fraction of Events Involving Middleboxes:**
  - **X-Axis:** Fraction of Events
  - **Y-Axis:** Number of Networks
  - **Description:**
    - The fraction of change events that involve middleboxes.
    - The prevalence of change events involving middleboxes was flagged by operators as being impactful.
