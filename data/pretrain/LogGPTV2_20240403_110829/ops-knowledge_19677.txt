User: How to generate a self-signed SSL certificate with OpenSSL? Please explain step by step.
Assistant: The following steps are required to generate a self-signed SSL certificate: 1. Install OpenSSL If OpenSSL is not installed, you need to install it first. The installation method differs depending on the operating system, and can be installed according to the corresponding operating system. 2. Generate a private key Enter the following command in the console: ``` openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048 ``` This will generate a 2048-bit RSA key, stored in a file named `server.key`. 3. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Enter the following command in the console: ``` openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr ``` This will generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), `server.key ` is the private key file generated before, `server.csr` is the file that stores the CSR. The following is an example of entering commands in the console: ``` $ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key ................ ...................................................+++ .. ..+++ writing new private key to 'server.key' ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank. ----- Country Name (2 letter code) []:US State or Province Name (full name) []: Locality Name (eg, city) []: Organization Name (eg, company) []:Example Company Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [] : Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:example.com Email Address []: Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request A challenge password []: An optional company name []: ``` When entering the above command, you need to fill in the following information: 1. Country Name: country/region code, such as "US"; 2. State or Province Name: full name of the state/province or the abbreviation of the province; 3. Locality Name: City name; 4. Organization Name: Organization name; 5. Organizational Unit Name: Organizational unit name; 6. Common Name: Which domain name the SSL certificate will be used for, such as "test.example.com"; 7. Email Address: Email address. The above information can be filled in according to actual needs, and you can press the "Enter" key to keep the default settings. 4. Generate a self-signed SSL certificate Enter the following command in the console: ``` openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt ``` This will use the generated private key Generate a self-signed SSL certificate with the certificate signing request, and `server.crt` is the file that stores the SSL certificate. The following is an example of entering commands in the console: ``` $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt Signature ok subject=/C=US/O=Example Company/ CN=example.com Getting Private key ``` When entering the above command, the information to be filled is the same as the previous steps. Finally, the generated self-signed SSL certificate `server.crt` and the previously generated RSA private key `server.key` can be used for SSL configuration on the server.
