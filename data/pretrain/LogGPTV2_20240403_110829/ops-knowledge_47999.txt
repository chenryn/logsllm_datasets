User: Load balancing is a common technical means in high availability architecture. What are the common load balancing algorithms? What kind of scenarios are they applicable to?
Assistant: Common load balancing algorithms include: round robin algorithm, random algorithm, minimum number of connections algorithm, IP hash algorithm and weighted round robin algorithm. 1. Polling algorithm: assign requests to different servers in turn, repeating the cycle. It is suitable for scenarios where the resource usage is the same and the request processing time is close. It can balance the traffic load of each server, and it is easy to understand and implement. 2. Random algorithm: Realize request allocation through random functions, which is suitable for scenarios where the amount of concurrency is not too large, and has flexibility and high efficiency. 3. Minimum connection number algorithm: By detecting the current connection number of the server, the request is allocated to the server with the least connection number. Applicable to scenarios where the processing time of the request is long, it can respond to the request quickly and reduce the response time and error rate. 4. IP hash algorithm: Hash operation is performed through the requested IP address, and the request is mapped to different servers. Applicable to scenarios where the IP address of the requester does not change frequently, it can maintain sessions, improve response speed and system stability. 5. Weighted round-robin algorithm: set the weight for each server and distribute according to the weight ratio. It is applicable to scenarios with different resource configurations and different processing capabilities, which can improve system performance and flexibility. According to different business scenarios, different load balancing algorithms can be selected for reasonable arrangement to achieve optimal system performance and stability.
