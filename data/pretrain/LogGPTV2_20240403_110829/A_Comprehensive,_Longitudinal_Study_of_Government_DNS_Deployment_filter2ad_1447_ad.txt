* Nameserver domains for Amazon, Hostgator, and AzureDNS are grouped together as described in Section IV-B.
that
if these are hosted by a single third-party provider,
that provider could become a single point of failure for that
domain. For example, in 2016, a DDoS attack targeting Dyn
seriously disrupted services for Dyn’s customer domains [34].
Although the risk of such providers sustaining an outage or
attack that is sufﬁcient to make a domain unavailable might
be low, the past few years have witnessed other ways in
which such dependency can become a real issue. It is thus
of interest to assess how much inﬂuence major third-party
DNS providers have upon governments. In general, a domain’s
nameservers are key to maintaining availability and reliability,
and it is helpful to understand the general characteristics of
these nameservers.
To evaluate trends in the use of DNS providers, we relied
on the PDNS data, as it gave insights into both the current
state and the patterns over the past few years. To examine the
popularity of a provider, we needed to check what nameserver
hostnames are associated with that provider. This is particu-
larly important for major providers, such as Amazon, which
use hundreds of different nameservers. For Amazon, which
follows a unique naming pattern, we can identify nameservers
by using a regex match. For other popular providers, we can
use a combination of string-matching on nameserver domain
names themselves and on the MNAME and RNAME ﬁelds in
their SOA records.
Popular Third-Party Providers. We ﬁrst attempted to an-
swer the question of to what extent third-party providers are
commonly used by popular domains [35], [36] (e.g., the Alexa
Top 1 Million) are also used by governments. We considered
what percent of all domains in our dataset used these providers
in 2011 and 2020, and what percent of the countries had
at least one domain using these providers — that is, how
widespread was their usage. To gain insight
into regional
trends, we grouped countries using the sub-region assigned
by the UN, and measured how many of these sub-regions
contained countries whose e-government domains relied on
top providers. Note that for the 10 countries with the most
records in the PDNS data, we considered these as having
unique behavior, and treated each of these as its own sub-
region. We also examined what percent of domains relying on
a single provider (d1P ) used one of these popular providers.
As Table II shows, the use of these major providers is global,
and their reach is growing. We notice that in particular the
percent of domains using Amazon and Cloudﬂare increased
slowly but steadily over the past several years from virtually
none to more than 2%. While this may seem to be a small
change, the number of domains using these providers increased
by multiple orders of magnitude, and many of these domains
are only using nameservers belonging to these providers. This
pattern is consistent with the observations in other works re-
porting centralization within the DNS [35], [36]. Even though
many governments use their own DNS infrastructures or DNS
services of local providers, the concentration of domains using
these top providers has been increasing. If this trend continues,
the concerns of increasing centralization in DNS nameserver
deployment will apply to government domains.

The previous measurement was guided by a list of DNS
providers used commonly by popular domains. It may be
that other providers have a greater impact among government
domains. To check if this was the case, we identiﬁed the top 10
providers, ranked by the number of countries served, in 2011
and 2020. Table III shows the prevalence of several providers
other than those indicated as common among popular domains,
though we observed again the rise of Cloudﬂare and Amazon.
We also noticed that the top 10 providers in 2020 account for
a larger portion of the domains in the dataset than in 2011.
Meanwhile, the number of countries with domains using any
single provider grew 60% from 52 in 2011 to 85 in 2020.
This again highlights increased centralization, although at this
point, the DNS ecosystem of government domains is still
highly heterogeneous.
C. Defective Delegations
A defective delegation (usually called a lame delegation)
occurs when a nameserver included in NS records for a zone
does not answer queries for that zone. Defective delegations
have several causes, including conﬁguration errors, changes in
nameservers without an update to the parent zone, and changes
in the services of a third-party provider. In some cases, defec-
tive delegations pose a serious security risk, leaving a domain
vulnerable to hijacking or monitoring. Even in cases where the
risk of monitoring or hijacking is low, defective delegations
can lead to performance degradation, due to increased latency
and extra trafﬁc [1], [20].
Defective Delegation Prevalence. Using the terminology
from [20], we refer to cases in which none of the authoritative
nameservers listed for a domain are able to provide answers
for that domain as a fully defective delegation. Cases where at
least one authoritative nameserver does not respond, we refer
to as partially defective defective delegations. Note that fully
defective delegations are a subset of the partially defective
delegations. We examined both partially and fully defective
delegations by checking the data from our active lookups. Fig-
ures 10a and 10b summarize the major patterns we observed
in defective delegations. Surprisingly, 29.5% of the domains
had a defective delegation. Slightly more than a quarter of the
domains (25.4%) had a partial defective delegation involving
the information just in the parent zone. This pattern is largely
driven by a few dgov with a large number of subdomains
and a relatively high rate of defective delegations. A few
countries have many more partially defective delegations than
fully defective delegations. In these cases, most of the domains
involved were sharing an authoritative nameserver that either
could not be resolved or was no longer serving those domains.
Hijacking Risks. We also explored what percentage of these
defective delegations would present a security risk for domain
hijacking. Most of them presented little to no risk of a
hijacking, as they involved nameservers belonging to govern-
ments themselves. We checked how many of the nameserver
domains not in a government domain were available, and
found 805 that could be registered (using GoDaddy). The
cost per domain ranged from 0.01 to 20,000 USD, with a
median of 11.99 USD (see Figure 12). These were used
by 1,121 domains in 49 countries. Figure 11 shows the
number of affected domains per country, and the number
of available nameserver domains for those countries with
the most affected domains. Only 2 available nameserver do-
mains were used by domains associated with governments
of more than one country. Similarly, for almost one third
of the countries whose subdomains had defective delega-
tions, these delegations pointed to nameservers in a single
domain. Several of the nameservers involved in the defective
delegations had patterns suggestive of typos. For example,
the parent zone for one domain listed pns12cloudns.net,
pns13cloudns.net, and pns14cloudns.net, along with
pns11.cloudns.net, which appears to be the only function-
ing nameserver of the four. For more than half (625) of the
domains in this scenario, we did not receive any authoritative
response from the authoritative nameservers at all, suggesting
the nameservers of these domains are no longer active. For
the dgov with the most affected subdomains, including Turkey,
Brazil, and Mexico, the majority of the subdomains were in
this group. These appear to be cases of stale records, in some
cases, dozens or even hundreds in the same dgov.
The existence of dangling NS records [37], though not
particularly surprising given the demonstrated prevalence of
this type of scenario in other areas, is nonetheless a serious
concern. The ability to control the resolution of domains with
the same sufﬁx domain as legitimate government domains
provides an avenue for serious attacks.

D. Parent-Child Inconsistency
The speciﬁcations for the DNS require that parent and child
zones should remain consistent [9]. That is, all of a zone’s
authoritative nameservers should contain the same NS RRs
for any given child zone as those contained in the child zone’s
authoritative nameservers. Inconsistency between zones could
result in unexpected load distribution patterns and increased
latency [20], [38]. In some cases, the inconsistency may also
indicate stale records and, as with defective delegations, the
potential for domain hijacking and privacy leakage.
To characterize the inconsistency between parent and child
zones, we followed the framework used in [39]. According to
this approach, for each domain we queried, we ﬁrst checked
if the nameservers listed in the parent zone (P ) and those
listed by the domain’s authoritative nameservers (C) were
identical. If they were not, we checked if the two sets have
at least one authoritative nameserver in common. When no
intersection existed, we explored to what extent there was
an intersection between the IPv4 addresses to which the
authoritative nameservers P and C resolve (denoted as IP (P )
and IP (C) respectively). If P and C overlapped by at least
one authoritative nameserver, we checked to see if P included
all authoritative nameservers in C or vice versa, or if neither
case held.
Inconsistency Prevalence. Figure 13 summarizes our ﬁndings
of zone inconsistency. For most (76.8%) of the domains that
were responsive, no inconsistency between the authoritative
nameservers in P and C appeared. While this percentage
was fairly high, it was substantially lower than that in [39],
in which the percentage of cases where P = C was more
than 90% of responsive domains in all the zones studied. We
found that the level of consistency is much higher (93.5%)
for domains at the second level of the DNS hierarchy than
domains with three or more levels (77% or less). In [39], only
Fig. 13: Summary of parent/child zone consistency
domains at the second level domains are considered. We would
expect more inconsistencies between zones further down in the
hierarchy, as these will generally be operated by increasingly
smaller entities that may have fewer resources to devote to
maintaining their DNS records, and may not experience as
many problems due to zone inconsistency as a larger entity
would. This speculation can be conﬁrmed by the observation
in [38], which reports that inconsistencies are more common
below the second level of the .edu domain than in the second
level itself.
As in the case with d1N Ss, the prevalence of disagreement
between zones varied widely by country, as shown in Fig-
ure 14. The countries with the largest percent of domains
having a disagreement tend to have few responsive domains,
but there are also some countries with a large number of
responsive domains where this behavior is relatively common.
Inconsistency between a parent and its child zone may
represent misconﬁgurations or stale NS records. For example,
we observed that in several cases where P (cid:54)= C, at least
one of the authoritative nameservers involved is not a fully
qualiﬁed domain name, i.e., a single label such as ns or dns-
server. This type of error arises from typos in zone ﬁles where
a trailing ‘.’ is added to what should be a relative domain
name. In this scenario, the authoritative nameserver cannot
append the origin to the name. As an illustration, consider
an NS record for a domain using ns.example.com as an
authoritative nameserver. If the record has the entry ns. rather
than ns, the authoritative nameserver returning the NS record
will simply send ns rather than ns.example.com.
Hijacking Risks. We found that 40.9% of domains for which
P (cid:54)= C also have at least one partially defective delegation.
The previous section explores these cases. Furthermore, a
dangling NS record may also exist even when there is no
defective delegation. For example, if the authoritative name-
server indicated in the parent zone now belongs to a parking
service,
the server may respond to all DNS queries with
answers directing users to their own servers. To explore this
scenario, we checked the cases of inconsistency where the
authoritative nameservers involved were not defective. As with
the defective delegations, we identiﬁed the domain names of
the authoritative nameservers that were not included in both P
and C, and checked to see if any is available for registration.
We found 13 dns that were available for registration. In

domain if at least one nameserver in its parent zone returned
NS records for the domain but no authoritative nameserver
sent a response. However, if a nameserver was unresponsive
while other authoritative nameservers in the same zone did
send answers, we did not re-send queries to the unresponsive
nameserver. This may have led us to moderately overestimate
the number of defective delegations. However, since many
authoritative nameservers are used by multiple domains, most
were checked at least twice. We found that only 5.7% of the
authoritative nameservers we examined cannot be resolved and
were only checked once, affecting 2,424 domains (less than
2% of the domains queried).
We examined the risks of domain hijacking, but did not
attempt to determine if any such attacks have taken place.
We could have explored it with active measurements or
via the PDNS data. However, verifying a domain hijacking
attack, particularly when using historical data, presents several
challenges, as domain owners may periodically change the
infrastructure they use. We will further investigate this problem
in our future work.
B. Potential Remedies
Addressing the issues we have explored is not a simple
task. Misconﬁgurations have plagued the DNS ecosystem for
decades, despite the availability of several tools to detect or
correct them. Vulnerabilities such as those we have highlighted
are hardly even surprising but nonetheless demand attention.
Regarding the number and diversity of authoritative name-
servers, zone operators may be challenged to ﬁnd a balance
between redundancy and dependency. While there may be
inexpensive options for achieving replication, these can in-
troduce new risks. For example, the use of third-party DNS
providers increases the attack surface of a domain [40], and
attackers can leverage vulnerabilities among such providers
to hijack domains [2]. Using such providers might also tend
to increase centralization within the DNS. Overall, updated
guidance or requirements on developing ADNS deployments
would be helpful to address this situation.
The problems of defective delegation and inconsistencies
between zones are different matters, as the approaches to
correct these are more well-deﬁned. Since the inception of the
DNS, various groups have developed tools for DNS debug-
ging [41]–[44]. Also, some popular authoritative nameserver
software has the capability of detecting defective delegation
or inconsistency between zones [22], [45], [46]. Addition-
ally, methods to streamline synchronization between various
parties in the DNS also exist. For example,
the Extensi-
ble Provisioning Protocol allows registrars to interact with
registries in an automated fashion [47]. Also, the CSYNC
record type provides a way for authoritative nameservers in
parent zones to automatically retrieve updates from their child
zones [10]. However, these tools are not without their own
complications. Speciﬁcations for EPP and CSYNC processing
include provisions that require out-of-band communications
for certain updates. For example, depending on how the
immediate bit in a CSYNC RR is set, the party responsible
Fig. 14: Distribution of the rate of disagreement per dgov
our dataset, these dns served 26 domains in seven different
countries. Twelve of the domains, representing district gov-
ernments in one country, had evidently all used the same
DNS provider, and that provider’s domain was expired. Other
cases were related to various entities, including a ministry of
ﬁnance, a group responsible for taxes, and local governments.
