### Two Downstream Throughput Bottleneck Scenarios

We analyzed two downstream throughput bottleneck scenarios: an access network bottleneck and a wireless bottleneck. In both experiments, we established through repeated trials that the wireless network capacity was approximately 40 Mbps.

- **Access Network Bottleneck**: The access link is set to 30 Mbps, making it the primary bottleneck. In this case, the Round-Trip Time (RTT) is about 5 ms.
- **Wireless Bottleneck**: The access link is set to 70 Mbps, making the wireless network the bottleneck. Packet buffering at the head of the wireless link (i.e., the access point) increases the RTT to about 25–35 ms.

### 2.3 Detection Algorithm

For each device \( d \), we employ two independent detectors:

1. **Access-Link Bottleneck Detector**: This detector uses a decision rule to determine whether an access-link bottleneck event \( B \) occurs, given a particular observed value of the coefficient of variation \( cv \).
2. **Wireless Bottleneck Detector**: This detector uses a decision rule to determine whether a wireless bottleneck event \( W \) occurs, given a particular observed value of the round-trip time \( \tau_d \).

We first compute the likelihood functions \( f(cv|B) \) and \( f(cv|\neg B) \) in a controlled setting, where we can control the throughput of the upstream link to introduce a bottleneck on the access link. The decision rule is defined in terms of the likelihood ratio:
\[
\Lambda(cv = v) = \frac{f(cv = v|B)}{f(cv = v|\neg B)}
\]
where \( v \) is the measured coefficient of variation of packet interarrival times over the observation window. If \( \Lambda \) exceeds a threshold \( \gamma \), the detector indicates that the access link is the bottleneck. We can tune the detector by varying \( \gamma \); higher values result in higher detection rates but also higher false positive rates. A similar approach is used for the wireless bottleneck detector.

### Minimum Traffic Requirements

Bottleneck detection requires sufficient network traffic. We set a minimum number of packets per second (\( T_{pps} \)) and a minimum number of packets per flow (\( T_{pf} \)) for running the Home Observation Agent (HoA). Figure 1 shows the distribution of packet rates across homes in the FCC deployment. Approximately 40% of one-second intervals have packet rates below 10 packets per second. We tested various \( T_{pps} \) values (50, 100, 150 packets per second) and \( T_{pf} \) values (25, 50, 75 packets per flow) on real-world data, and none of these settings altered our conclusions.

### 2.4 Calibration

We built a testbed to conduct controlled experiments for calibrating detection thresholds. The testbed includes an access point, its LAN, a network traffic shaper upstream of the access point, a well-provisioned university network, and servers within the university network. The access point is a Netgear WNDR3800 router running OpenWrt. We use `tc` and `netem` on a second WNDR3800 router to vary the downstream throughput of the emulated access link. We run our tests against servers in the same well-provisioned university network to avoid potential wide-area bottlenecks.

- **Access-Link Experiments**: We shape the link to different throughput levels while keeping the wireless link constant. The ground truth is straightforward as we know the capacities of both the wireless link and the shaped access link. We use 802.11a and 802.11n with respective capacities of 21 Mbps and 80 Mbps over TCP.
- **Wireless Bottleneck Experiments**: 
  1. **Reduce Capacity by Degrading Channel Quality**: We position the host at different distances from the access point and introduce obstructions and transient issues.
  2. **Reduce Available Capacity by Creating Contention**: We use an interfering host sending constant UDP traffic close to the access point.

We performed 1,356 experiments under various operating conditions. In our testbed, the wireless channel delivers a TCP throughput of about 80 Mbps on 802.11n.

### 2.5 Limitations

HoA has several limitations:

1. **Traffic Requirement**: It relies on passive traffic analysis, so the link must carry enough traffic for analysis. Section 2.3 details how we determine minimum thresholds for detection.
2. **Constant Bit Rate Traffic**: This could yield a low \( cv \), causing HoA to mistakenly detect a throughput bottleneck on the access link. Other detection methods may be needed in such cases.
3. **Root Cause Identification**: HoA cannot identify the root cause of bottlenecks or bottlenecks far from the last mile, such as peering or server-side bottlenecks.
4. **Work-Conserving Assumption**: HoA can only locate throughput bottlenecks where the link is work-conserving. Wireless links violate this assumption, so HoA cannot detect upstream throughput bottlenecks.
5. **Threshold Sensitivity**: Detection thresholds may depend on specific settings and configurations. For example, \( T_{\tau} \) may depend on the wireless driver and hardware, and \( T_{cv} \) may depend on the channel bonding configuration of DOCSIS modems.
6. **CPU Load**: To reduce CPU load, HoA collects data periodically, which may not capture aspects of the network that vary over small timescales.

### 2.6 Deployments

Table 1 summarizes our two deployments:

| Deployment | Homes | Location | Duration | Tests |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| BISmark    | 64    | 15 Countries | March 6–April 6, 2013 | 52,252 |
| FCC        | 2,652 | United States | November 4–5, 2014 | 73,193 |

**BISmark Deployment**: We deployed HoA on Netgear’s WNDR3700/3800 routers, which have an Atheros chipset with a 450 MHz processor, one 802.11bgn radio, and one 802.11an radio. The devices run OpenWrt with the Minstrel rate adaptation algorithm. Every 5 minutes, HoA collects packet traces from the WAN port for 15 seconds and extracts timestamps and per-flow RTTs using `tcptrace`.

**FCC Deployment**: We used the FCC’s deployment of Netgear WNR3500L routers, which have a Broadcom chipset and a 480 MHz processor, one 802.11bgn radio, and 64 MB of RAM. The devices run a custom Netgear firmware based on OpenWRT. Due to resource constraints, we imposed a packet limit and a time limit for trace collection, and we offload the packet header traces for offline analysis.

### 3. Results

Our findings are as follows:

1. **Home Networks with High Throughput**: In home networks where downstream throughput exceeds 20 Mbps, the home wireless network is the primary cause of throughput bottlenecks.
2. **Low Throughput Networks**: Access link bottlenecks are prevalent in home networks where the downstream throughput is less than 10 Mbps.
3. **Wireless Throughput Bottlenecks**: In homes where HoA detects a wireless throughput bottleneck, it is about equally likely that the bottleneck is isolated to a single device or observed across all devices.
