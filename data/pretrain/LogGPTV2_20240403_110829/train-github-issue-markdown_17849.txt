Jonathan recently created the code and layout for the new certificates.
  * going through the "claim your ____ certificate" challenges grants camper the appropriate certificate
  * certificates have proper verbiage and all 9 have a different color that corresponds to one of the colors in our design style guide
  * 3 old certificates and 6 new certificates all show up on profile if claimed
