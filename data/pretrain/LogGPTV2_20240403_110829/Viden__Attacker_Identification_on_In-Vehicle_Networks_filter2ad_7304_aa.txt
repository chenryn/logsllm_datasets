## Attacker Identification and Intrusion Detection for In-vehicle Networks

**Authors:** Jing Ning, Jiadai Wang, Jiajia Liu, and Nei Kato

**Abstract:**
As the most widely used in-vehicle data bus protocol, CAN (Controller Area Network) has attracted increasing attention due to its lack of security mechanisms. Various attacks against the CAN bus have emerged, posing serious threats to vehicle safety. While several methods have been proposed to detect CAN bus attacks, they often suffer from high computational overhead and significant false detection rates. To address these issues, we propose an LOF (Local Outlier Factor)-based intrusion detection method that leverages the physical characteristics of the voltage signal on the CAN bus. Our method significantly reduces the false detection rate and improves detection accuracy without modifying the CAN protocol or adding computational burden. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of bus-off intrusion detection on real vehicles.

### I. Introduction

The rapid development of the modern automotive industry has led to a heightened focus on safe and comfortable driving experiences. This has resulted in the proliferation of advanced vehicle applications such as infotainment systems, on-board diagnostics, and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs). However, these complex auxiliary functions, which rely on wired electronics and Electronic Control Units (ECUs), also introduce potential security risks. The CAN bus, as the most widely used in-vehicle data bus, is particularly vulnerable due to its lack of encryption, authentication, access control, and message verification mechanisms. Various attack methods targeting the CAN bus have emerged, leading to serious safety concerns and threats to passengers' lives and property. Therefore, securing the CAN bus and identifying intruders in CAN-based in-vehicle networks are critical research areas.

Several pioneering studies have focused on enhancing CAN bus security through protocol modifications, but these approaches often introduce unnecessary computational loads. To avoid these burdens, recent research has explored the use of physical characteristics of the CAN bus. For example, ACK (ACKnowledge character) learning can help identify whether a measured voltage signal originates from a legitimate sender. Other researchers have proposed clock-based anomaly detection systems, but these methods cannot locate abnormal ECUs. Kneib et al. developed Scission, an intrusion detection system that identifies legitimate ECUs using fingerprint extraction of CAN frames, but it still has a non-negligible false detection probability.

To address the need for accurate attacker identification and overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose an LOF-based intrusion detection method that can be implemented on real vehicles. By leveraging the unique voltage waveforms generated by different ECUs, our method can distinguish between legitimate and malicious senders, even when ECUs are malfunctioning. We construct three attack models to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to existing methods, our solution does not require modifications to the CAN protocol, avoids additional computational burdens, and significantly reduces false detection rates while improving detection accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of bus-off intrusion detection on real vehicles.

### II. Controller Area Network and Threat Models

#### A. CAN Protocol and Voltage Characteristics

The CAN bus is the most commonly used broadcast in-vehicle data bus, connecting ECUs to exchange messages and control vehicle modules. It uses two lines, CAN-H (CAN-High) and CAN-L (CAN-Low), with opposite potentials to prevent external electromagnetic interference. The voltage of CAN-H ranges from 2.5V to 3.5V, while CAN-L ranges from 1.5V to 2.5V. In our experiments, we use the differential voltage between these two lines to minimize noise errors.

CAN frames can be categorized into four types: data frames, remote frames, error frames, and overload frames. Data frames include an ID field, a DLC (Data Length Code) field, data content, and check bits. The CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) field is used for error detection, and the ACK field confirms correct data transmission. Figure 1 illustrates the format of a data frame.

#### B. Spoofing Attack

The CAN bus is vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to its lack of encryption, authentication, access control, and message verification. Attackers can analyze CAN messages, master the instructions in CAN frames, and launch flood attacks by repeatedly sending messages. They can also connect to the CAN bus through on-board infotainment systems or remote cellular communication devices. To combat these attacks, researchers have found that the unique voltage waveforms generated by different ECUs can be used to detect external senders.

#### C. Bus-off Attack

Bus-off attacks, a recently discovered type of DoS (Denial of Service) attack, exploit the error handling mechanism of the in-vehicle network to inject attack messages periodically, causing normal ECUs to think they have a problem and potentially shutting down the entire network. When different bits (dominant and recessive) are transmitted simultaneously in fields other than the ID field, the CAN protocol's fault-confinement mechanism increases the Transmit Error Counter (TEC). If the TEC exceeds 255, the vehicle enters a bus-off state, rendering the corresponding ECU and the entire in-vehicle network inoperable. Figure 2 illustrates a bus-off attack.

### III. LOF-Based Intrusion Detection Scheme

In this section, we present our LOF-based vehicle intrusion detection method. After feature extraction and dimension reduction, the LOF algorithm is used to detect intrusions.

#### A. Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

We use the physical characteristics of the CAN bus to achieve ECU identification and intrusion detection. First, we select signals with differential voltages continuously greater than 0.1V as our samples. Second, to accurately describe sample features and distinguish between different ECU voltages, we divide each waveform into three parts: rising edge, falling edge, and stationary segment. The rising and falling edges contain more feature information, as shown in Figure 3. Finally, we perform three-stage FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) on each part and obtain parameters of the response curve in both the time and frequency domains.

#### B. Dimension Reduction

Dimension reduction removes redundant features, retains representative features, and reduces computational complexity. We calculate Pearson correlation coefficients for each feature and rank them by relevance. We then determine the dimensions of the retained features, noting that more dimensions do not necessarily yield better results, as redundant data can cause unnecessary errors. Through practical testing and computational complexity considerations, we use eight features for subsequent experiments.

The correlation coefficient \( r \) is expressed as:

\[
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{\sigma_X} \right) \left( \frac{Y_i - \bar{Y}}{\sigma_Y} \right)}{n}
\]

where \( X_i \) and \( Y_i \) are the standard scores, \( \bar{X} \) and \( \bar{Y} \) are the mean values, and \( \sigma_X \) and \( \sigma_Y \) are the standard deviations for the \( X \) and \( Y \) samples, respectively.
