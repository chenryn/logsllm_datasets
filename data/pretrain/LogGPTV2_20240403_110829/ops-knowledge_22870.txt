User: I would like to be able to perform a ping and traceroute from within Python without having to execute the corresponding shell commands so I'd prefer a native python solution.
Assistant: ICMP Ping is standard as part of the ICMP protocol.
Traceroute uses features of ICMP and IP to determine a path via Time To  Live values.  Using TTL values, you can do traceroutes in a variety of protocols as long as IP/ICMP work because it is the ICMP TTL EXceeded messages that tell you about the hop in the path.
If you attempt to access a port where no listener is available, by ICMP protocol rules, the host is supposed to send an ICMP Port Unreachable message.
