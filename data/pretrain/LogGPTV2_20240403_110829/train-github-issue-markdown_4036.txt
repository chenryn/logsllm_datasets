Currently (on Windows) when you open a file via command line with _\--reuse-
window_ the file is opened but Code just flashes its icon on the taskbar
staying in background.  
Please consider adding a commandline option --bring-to-front or bring Code
window to front regardless when file is opened from the command line.
