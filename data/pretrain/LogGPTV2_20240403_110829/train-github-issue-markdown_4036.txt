Currently, on Windows, when a file is opened via the command line using the `--reuse-window` option, the file opens but Visual Studio Code (Code) only briefly flashes its icon on the taskbar and remains in the background.

To improve this behavior, please consider adding a command-line option, such as `--bring-to-front`, to bring the Code window to the foreground whenever a file is opened from the command line. Alternatively, the Code window could be brought to the front automatically, regardless of the specific command-line option used.
