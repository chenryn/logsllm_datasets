I am using Colab where OpenCV version is 4.1.2 and while trying to do
inference of a YOLOv7 model I got following error:  
`error: OpenCV(4.1.2) /io/opencv/modules/dnn/src/darknet/darknet_io.cpp:554:
error: (-212:Parsing error) Unsupported activation: logistic in function
'ReadDarknetFromCfgStream'`
And above error came in this line of code `net =
cv2.dnn.readNet('/content/gdrive/MyDrive/yolov7/yolov7-obj.cfg',
'/content/gdrive/MyDrive/yolov7/weights/yolov7-obj_final.weights')`
The weight and cfg file can be used from the following official links:

and
