### Detection and Collection Analysis

- **Detection Rate and Collection Time:**
  - 26% of the samples were collected on the same day they entered the VirusTotal database.
  - The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the detection rate for the collected samples, based on VirusTotal reports, is shown in Figure 7.
  - 42% of the samples were detected by 50% of the antivirus engines, with a maximum detection rate of 77%.

- **Detection Delay:**
  - Five samples (26%) were collected on the same day they entered the VirusTotal database.
  - The maximum detection delay was five days.
  - The analysis reports from VirusTotal were generated one month after the collection date, leading to higher detection rates due to daily signature updates. Despite this, some samples were recognized by only one-third of the antivirus products.

### Mailbox Analysis

- **Email Content:**
  - The decoy accounts received a total of 4,209 emails, of which 403 contained 1,136 attachments.
  - The emails contained 5,581 URLs, which were classified to identify phishing URLs and URLs that downloaded malware.
  - 26 URLs belonged to phishing domains, and 7 URLs downloaded malware samples.

- **Attachment Analysis:**
  - Most attachments were pictures, but some were Windows media files and office documents.
  - MD5 hashes of the files were checked against the VirusTotal database, but no matches were found, as expected, since Hotmail scans incoming emails for malware and blocks executables.
  - Two ".zip" files, when extracted, returned a ".lnk" file, which were command-line scripts that connect to an FTP site to download and execute malicious software. For a detailed analysis, refer to the F-Secure report [9].

### Comparison to Email Spam

- **IM-Based Attacks vs. Email Spam:**
  - To determine if IM-based attacks are unique or if they use other communication channels, we compared the campaigns collected by HoneyBuddy with email spam collected by Spam Archive [19].
  - From 458,615 spam emails, 467,211 unique URLs belonging to 52,000 unique TLDs were extracted.
  - Only one common instance of a well-known benign website was found, confirming that IM attacks are distinct from email spam.
  - Comparing TLDs, 21 common domains were found, of which 9 were popular and benign. The remaining 12 suspicious domains included 3 porn, 3 malware, 2 dating, 1 adware, and 3 unclassified domains. None hosted MSN phishing scams, indicating that IM-based attacks are crafted specifically for this medium.

### Comparison to Commercial Anti-Phishing Products

- **Evaluation with Norton Safe Web:**
  - To verify if the URLs collected by our infrastructure had been seen by large vendors, we used the Norton Safe Web service provided by Symantec.
  - Out of 2,010 phishing and malware URLs, only 13% were flagged as dangerous or suspicious.
  - Specifically, 246 phishing and 10 malware-distributing URLs were reported as malicious, while the rest were characterized as safe.
  - This indicates that over 87% of the malicious URLs collected by HoneyBuddy had not been properly categorized as dangerous by one of the largest security vendors.

### Hosting Analysis

- **IP Address Analysis:**
  - We conducted an experiment over 50 days to gather more information about how and where attackers host phishing and malware-distributing domains.
  - All top-level domains translated to one or two IP addresses, with 98% translating to only one.
  - Ten of the top-level domains belonged to fast-flux networks, changing IP addresses frequently.
  - During the first days, all 101 top-level domains translated to only 14 different IP addresses, consistent throughout the experiment.

- **Country Breakdown:**
  - Using the MaxMind database, we found that Hong Kong hosted 26% of the domains, followed by the United States with 22%.
  - Surprisingly, only 13% of the domains were hosted in China, lower than expected based on reports [21].

- **Malware-Distributing Domains:**
  - Unlike phishing domains, each top-level domain for malware-distributing sites translated to a different IP address, with only one to three IP addresses overlapping at any time.
  - The IP address hosting three malware-distributing domains also hosted one phishing domain and was located in the United States.
  - No other IP addresses hosted both types of domains, and none of the top-level domains were in both sets.

- **Country Breakdown for Malware:**
  - The United States hosted 86% of the malware-distributing domains, with Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands hosting an equal amount of the remaining domains.
  - Again, it was surprising that China did not host any of the domains caught by our infrastructure.

### Attacker Profile

- **Behavior and Strategy:**
  - In Figure 12, the number of unique compromised accounts sending URLs to our decoy accounts over time follows a sub-linear curve, with almost 100 new accounts contacting us each month.
  - In Figure 13, the CDF plot shows that approximately 25% of the compromised accounts sent only one URL, and 40% sent up to two URLs.
  - This suggests a possible strategy where attackers may focus on a limited number of URLs per account, even if some accounts are disinfected before sending additional URLs.
