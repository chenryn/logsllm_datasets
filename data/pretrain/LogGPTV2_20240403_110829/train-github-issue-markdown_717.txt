Decide what to do with each of these
  * deprecate `from_csv` ~~/ change to be exactly like`read_csv`~~ -> #17812
  * from_dict
  * from_records (see #8161)
  * from_items (#18529)
This is just a suggestion: `DataFrame` constructor already supports the things
that `from_dict` and `from_records` do (`from_items` is not supported by the
constructor, but maybe it should be?). Also `from_csv` does the same thing as
`pd.read_csv`.
Since `There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.`
maybe these methods should be removed/deprecated?
I know that this would cause backward incompatibility, so maybe just a
deprecation warning could be displayed until a future major release that could
remove them.
