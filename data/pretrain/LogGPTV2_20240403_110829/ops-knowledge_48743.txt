User: Please list at least three common database types, along with their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: 1. Relational database Advantages: Based on table structure, easy to understand and operate, easy to maintain and expand, with ACID characteristics (atomicity, consistency, isolation and persistence), support transaction processing and multi-user concurrency control . Disadvantages: Slow performance, not suitable for large-scale data storage, data structure cannot be changed flexibly, table structure and field types need to be defined in advance, not flexible enough. 2. Non-relational database (NoSQL database) Advantages: unstructured, high flexibility, adaptable to large-scale and high concurrency requirements, high performance and scalability, and can support multiple data models, such as key-value pairs , documents, column families, graphs, etc. Disadvantages: weak data consistency, not suitable for transaction processing and multi-user concurrency control, availability and data recovery capabilities are not as good as relational databases, and data query statements are limited. 3. In-Memory database Advantages: data reading and writing speed is very fast, more suitable for interactive and real-time applications, can better support high concurrency and real-time data processing, and can respond to data operations in real time. Disadvantages: The memory capacity is limited and the price is relatively expensive. It is not suitable for large-scale and long-term data storage. Once the data is lost, it cannot be recovered. It is not suitable for applications involving high security and reliability requirements.
