Question: A pen tester is analyzing the security of a web application. During the assessment, the tester retrieves the robots.txt file and notices several Disallow directives. Understanding that web spiders, robots, or crawlers can intentionally ignore these directives, which of the following is the most accurate conclusion the tester can draw from this information?
"A": "The Disallow directives can be used to effectively protect sensitive web application directories from being indexed by search engines and accessed by unauthorized users.",
"B": "The Disallow directives in the robots.txt file are suggestions for the behavior of web spiders, robots, or crawlers and are not enforced by the server, making them unreliable for security enforcement.",
"C": "The robots.txt file is a legal document that web spiders, robots, or crawlers must adhere to, and any violation of the Disallow directives can lead to legal consequences for the offending party.",
"D": "The presence of Disallow directives indicates a robust security configuration, ensuring that the specified paths are completely inaccessible to all web spiders, robots, or crawlers."
Answer: B
