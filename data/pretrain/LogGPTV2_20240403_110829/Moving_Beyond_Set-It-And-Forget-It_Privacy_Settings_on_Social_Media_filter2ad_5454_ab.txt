highlighting a post’s potential audience and impact [75, 78].
Some researchers have also proposed using machine learning
to predict a post’s initial privacy setting. For example, Fang and
LeFevre use active learning and friend clustering to predict fine-
grained privacy settings [23]. Others have built predictive mod-
els for computing inter-user tie strength [28], user-level privacy
scores [46], privacy risk [83], and the privacy similarity between
users [27]. More recently, Fiesler et al. built a logistic regression
model to predict whether or not a post should be public [24]. Super-
vised learning has also been used to understand private information
disclosure attacks in online social networks, specifically for sen-
sitive attribute inference [26, 29, 39, 43, 82], sensitive relationship
inference [10, 81], and identity matching across platforms [80].
While these efforts focus on helping users choose the initial
privacy setting for a post at the time it is posted, we instead focus
on helping users identify posts where this initial privacy setting
no longer matches the currently desired setting. We build on these
prior models by incorporating features they found to be predictive,
adding other features, and testing different model architectures. A
frequently proposed, and sometimes implemented, idea is to in-
stead let users set an “expiration date” when making posts [3] or
to otherwise set a time limit on information sharing. For example,
Snapchat messages disappear after a matter of seconds [56], In-
stagram stories disappear after 24 hours [32], and the visibility of
WeChat moments can be restricted to three days, six months, or
forever [77]. However, prior work has found that users’ predictions
about future changes in the visibility of their posts frequently do
not match their later preferences when revisiting those posts [6].
5 USER STUDY METHODOLOGY
To understand Facebook users’ longitudinal privacy attitudes and
practices, document the degree to which retrospective reevaluation
of privacy settings is needed, and collect the data needed to build
and test predictive models for helping users do so, we conducted a
user study. We investigate these questions using data collected in
two surveys alongside an anonymized version of each participant’s
full Facebook timeline and activity log (collected with consent).
5.1 Recruitment and Survey 1
We recruited participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk who
were located in North America, 18+ years old, and had a 95%+
approval rating. We screened participants using their account data
to verify that they met our inclusion criteria. These criteria, also
listed on the study advertisement, were: (i) had a Facebook account
for at least 2 years and (ii) made at least 10 posts in the last year.

used the Selenium browser automation tool [65] to download the
relevant parts of a participant’s timeline and activity log.
Programmatic data collection: We performed all data collec-
tion programmatically. Researchers never viewed the raw HTML
of any participant’s account. In Survey 2, we embedded links to the
Facebook URLs of posts and profiles rather than saving or serving
any potentially sensitive content on our servers.
Anonymization: We only stored anonymized versions of the
data by using one-way hashes for any unique identifiers (e.g., nu-
meric Facebook IDs, names of any Facebook users) that could be
considered personally identifiable information (PII). We also did
not analyze or store any photos included in posts. We performed
this anonymization procedure before writing data to disk. Despite
our best efforts, we acknowledge that some collected data (e.g., the
content of a post) might still contain PII (e.g., a nickname) that is
very hard to detect automatically. Our anonymization strategy is
similar to what Facebook themselves adopt via App-Scoped IDs in
their API [17]. We never tried to deanonymize any account.
Targeted data collection: We did not collect data from any
Facebook page that is not part of a participant’s account. Specifi-
cally, we did not collect information posted by participant’s friends.
We collected aggregate data on likes and comments made on the
participant’s timeline, as well as the participant’s own likes and
comments. In contrast to earlier studies [28, 57], we chose not to
collect potentially useful data on the structure of the social graph
from participants’ friends, who had not volunteered to participate.
5.3 Survey 2
Survey 2 contained two parts. In Part 1, we embedded links to five
randomly selected posts from the participant’s timeline. We showed
the post’s current privacy setting and asked if the participant had
ever changed (or considered changing) that setting. We also asked
participants whether they wanted to keep that privacy setting or
choose a different one moving forward, and why. Different from
earlier studies [4, 6], we chose to remind participants of their current
privacy setting for each post and make “keep this setting” the first
option. While this could prime users to keep their current privacy
setting, keeping the current setting minimizes friction.
In Part 2 of Survey 2, we revisited those same five posts, this time
showing the participant six specific Facebook friends who could
currently see each post. We asked whether or not the participant
preferred to continue sharing that post with that person moving
forward, or whether they did not care (so as to differentiate strong
preferences from indifference or a default preference).
Figure 1: Our protocol and process of data collection.
These ensured the accounts were sufficiently well-used for us to
investigate retrospective privacy management.
Participants volunteered for the study, installed our browser
extension (see below), and then took Survey 1. This survey asked
about the participant’s overall Facebook usage, their use of Face-
book’s privacy features, and their demographics. Participants were
compensated $10 for each survey. Appendices A–B contain the
survey instruments.
5.2 Ethical Collection of Facebook Data
Both measuring longitudinal behaviors and building predictive
models necessitate the collection of participants’ Facebook data.
Our goals for this data collection were to collect data in the most
privacy-preseving way possible and to obtain very explicit and
fully informed consent from participants for doing so. We first
considered having participants use Facebook’s “download your data”
feature and uploading this full set to our servers. While full consent
would be possible, we would inadvertently be writing private data
(including Facebook messages and ad clicks) to disk, so we rejected
this option. Alternatively, we considered partnering with Facebook
under their blanket TOS agreement for data collection. We rejected
this option because prior research using this approach, including
the widely discussed 2014 Social Contagion study, demonstrated
barriers for giving meaningful consent [66].
We thus decided to design a protocol leveraging a browser ex-
tension that elicits meaningful informed consent from participants
and collects data in a privacy-preserving way. This protocol was
approved by our IRB. Figure 1 summarizes our data-collection in-
frastructure. This infrastructure enables us to collect, with the par-
ticipant’s permission, anonymized versions of their full Facebook
timeline (posts they previously made), as well as their Facebook ac-
tivity log. The former enables us to programmatically analyze their
prior posts, as well as those posts’ privacy settings and metadata
(e.g., likes, comments). The latter enables us to analyze the temporal
evolution of their set of Facebook friends and similar events.
Because of the nature of the data we were collecting, we did
not consider a standard consent form sufficient. Thus, after partici-
pants agreed to our standard consent form, we provided a separate
page detailing the data we would and would not collect from their
Facebook account, including visual examples of our anonymization
procedures (described below) and an overview of our technical ap-
proach. If the participant wished to continue, they then downloaded
a browser extension we designed. This extension shared their Face-
book session cookie with a server at our institution. Our servers

CCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom
Based on our observation that the “friends only” privacy setting
changes meaning as a user adds friends and our hypothesis that
participants might want to stop sharing content with Facebook
friends with whom they never interact, we used stratified sampling
to select the six Facebook friends. For each post, one friend was
randomly selected from each of the six categories enumerated in
Table 1, which capture temporal changes in how the users interact,
as well as whether the users were friends at the time of the post.1
Sampling based on visible interaction was inspired by Gilbert et al.,
who used similar interaction features to measure tie strength [28].
We calculated the level of interaction as the sum of: (i) the number of
words exchanged via timeline posts and comments; (ii) the number
of intimate [74] words exchanged; (iii) the number of posts on each
other’s timelines; and (iv) the number of likes and reactions the
participant and their friend gave each other’s posts. We divided
friends into high (top 10% of friends) and low interaction (no visible
interaction) buckets and exclude those who fall in neither. For each
post, we computed visible interaction within two time spans: the
year before our study, and the year before the post was made. For
each post, we thus randomly sampled one friend per category. At
the conclusion of Survey 2, we instructed participants to uninstall
the plugin and log out of Facebook to invalidate their session cookie.
5.4 Data Analysis
As detailed when we present results, we performed statistical testing
to investigate our targeted quantitative hypotheses. We also built
and evaluated statistical models using standard evaluation measures
like accuracy, precision, and recall.
For consistency, two researchers independently coded free-text
responses using a shared codebook. Across questions, Cohen’s κ
(inter-rater agreement [42]) ranged from 0.7 to 1, indicating substan-
tial to perfect agreement. The coders met to resolve disagreements
and choose a final code for each response.
5.5 Limitations
A core limitation is that we used a convenience sample of North
American MTurk workers, and this sample consisted of only 78
participants. Nevertheless, our sample still contained participants
with wide variations in account age and daily usage. Furthermore,
our results likely underestimated privacy needs as highly privacy-
sensitive individuals would be unlikely to participate in our study.
However, even our participants wanted to restrict the visibility of
13.9% of posts they saw. In our study, we recruited English-speaking
US Facebook users to enable comparisons to prior work. Thus,
our results may not generalize to users from other languages or
countries. As we only consider visible interactions on Facebook, we
inevitably miss offline interactions. Our goal, however, is building
predictive models that leverage only online data.
6 RETROSPECTIVE PREFERENCES
Here, we characterize participants’ retrospective access control
preferences for their old Facebook posts. Broadly, our results rein-
force the need for automated assistance in reviewing access control
(privacy) settings for aging Facebook posts.

6.1 Participants’ Demographics
A total of 101 participants installed our plugin and completed Sur-
vey 1. However, 13 participants did not meet our stated inclusion
criteria (e.g., based on the age of their account), so we did not invite
them to participate in Survey 2. Of the remaining 88 participants,
78 completed Survey 2, and those are the responses we analyze. For
these 78 participants, we collected preferred privacy settings for
390 posts and 2,340 friend-post pairs (see Section 5). The posts for
which participants answered our questions had a median age of 2.6
years (minimum 9.9 days, maximum 9.9 years).
Basic demographics: Among participants, 69% identified as fe-
male, and the rest as male. This skews more female than Facebook
overall (52% female in 2018 [71]). A plurality (46%) of participants
were in the 25–34 age range, and the overall age distribution is
consistent with Facebook users overall in 2018 [72]. 87% of partici-
pants identified as white and 9% as black. 18% of participants held
a degree or job in computer science or a similar field.
Facebook usage: Among participants, 89.7% reported daily Face-
book use, with median usage of 1 hour per day. We summarize
participants’ Facebook accounts in Table 2. While we did not specif-
ically attempt to recruit users with especially long-lived accounts,
55 of our 78 participants’ accounts were at least 10 years old. In
aggregate, participants made a total of 253,122 posts on their own
Facebook timeline, with the median participant making 1,840 posts.
Their activity logs showed participants also performed significant
non-post activity, such as liking other posts or watching videos.
6.2 Temporal Changes in Facebook Usage
In Survey 1, we asked participants to report the primary topics of
their Facebook posts at three points in time: one year after they
initially created their account; at the time of the survey; and halfway
between the two. At each point, participants reported posting about
their personal lives, including humorous content and updates about
their family. Only 5 participants (6.4%) said posting updates about
their personal lives was their primary Facebook activity at the
time of the study, whereas 15 participants (19.2%) said it was their
primary Facebook activity at the midpoint of their account lifetime.
We also asked participants which year they thought their Face-
book usage peaked, and how their current usage compares with
their peak usage. On average, participants reported their Facebook
usage (amount of time spent on Facebook) peaked 5.6 years ago
(σ = 3.4, median = 5). Two-thirds of participants reported that they
currently spend less time on Facebook than they did during the
peak year. This evolution in Facebook usage further motivates the
need for retrospective privacy-management tools.
Increasing audiences: For the 55 participants whose Facebook
accounts were at least a decade old, we analyzed how their set of
Facebook friends changed over time. Figure 2 shows the percentage
of participants’ current friends added over the past years (using

our observed distribution of privacy settings on pre-2011 posts
suggests a recent (and significant) restriction of the visibility of
old posts. 2011 also saw the introduction of the “limit past posts”
feature, which our participants might have used to restrict their
