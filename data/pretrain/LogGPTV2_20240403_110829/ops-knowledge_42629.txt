User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Remote IP's with HAProxy I'm testing a new web server setup which is having a couple of issues.  Essentially, we have a web server, where the code uses the remote IP for some interesting things, and also some apache directories secured down to some certain IP's (our office etc).

However, we've just chucked this behind ha_proxy so we can look at adding some more app servers, but now the remote IP is always coming through as the proxy ip, not the real remote user.  This means we can't get to some locations, and our app is behaving a little oddly where user IP is important.

Our config is as follows:

global
      maxconn 4096
      pidfile /var/run/haproxy.pid
      daemon

defaults
      mode http
      retries 3
      option redispatch
      maxconn 2000
      contimeout 5000
      clitimeout 50000
      srvtimeout 50000

listen farm xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80
      mode http
      cookie GALAXY insert
      balance roundrobin
      option httpclose
      option forwardfor
      stats enable
      stats auth username:userpass

      server app1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80 maxconn 1 check

Assistant: Quoted from the HAProxy doc at haproxy.1wt.eu.

- if the application needs to log the original client's IP, use the
  "forwardfor" option which will add an "X-Forwarded-For" header with the
  original client's IP address. You must also use "httpclose" to ensure
  that you will rewrite every requests and not only the first one of each
  session:
        option httpclose
        option forwardfor

It is stated that the application must treat the X-Forwarded-For HTTP Header to know the
client IP adress.
Seems like the only way to go in your case.
Updated for HAProxy 1.4

Haproxy 1.4 introduced a new mode with &quot;option http-server-close&quot;. It
still closed the connection to the server but maintains keep-alive
towards the client if possible and used. On most setups, you probably
want to use that as it helps with latency on the single high-latency
part of your connection (between Haproxy and the client).
