### Firmware Releases and Open-Source Libraries

In our analysis of firmware releases, we identified 441 unique open-source libraries. When counting different versions of the same library as distinct, this number increases to 654. While some vendors consistently use the same version across their images, others do not. For example, among the 12 Belkin devices we studied (each corresponding to one image), there are 80 unique libraries spanning 103 different versions. This finding suggests inconsistent patching practices.

Despite the significant variation in the range of libraries used (441 across just 26 devices), a common subset of libraries is shared across many devices. Figure 2 illustrates the most popular libraries, which appear in at least 50% of the devices. OpenSSL and BusyBox are the most ubiquitous, used by 92.31% and 88.46% of the 26 devices, respectively. The figure also shows the percentage of vendors who use these libraries on their devices.

### Patching Practices

To better understand the security risks associated with third-party library use, we examined firmware releases over time and their alignment with library patches and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) disclosures. Historical release data was available for only five devices from Nest and D-Link, so we analyzed 100 firmware releases for these devices over a seven-year period (2011-2018).

We chose OpenSSL for our study for two reasons: it is a widely used library, present in all vendor devices except for Ring, which uses GnuTLS, and it is critical for software security with a well-documented history of vulnerability discoveries and patches [52]. By examining OpenSSL versions in firmware releases and comparing them to OpenSSL's update history, we analyzed vendors' patching behaviors and outstanding vulnerabilities over time.

Figure 3 shows the "age" of the OpenSSL library, defined as the number of days since the release date of a particular version. The dashed lines represent the actual library versions used in different device firmwares, while the solid green lines represent the ideal scenario where devices always use the most up-to-date library versions. As shown, device firmware updates often lag behind the latest OpenSSL versions, sometimes by hundreds of days. For example, Nest Protect's last firmware release on July 13, 2016, used an OpenSSL version that was 1525 days old, while the latest available version was only 71 days old. Additionally, multiple new firmware releases were made without incorporating the latest library version, indicating missed opportunities for updates. Even devices from the same vendor often use different library versions, highlighting the challenges in coordinating upgrades.

The Nest Learning Thermostat appears to have the best patching practices among the devices in our study, sometimes even using the latest OpenSSL version (indicated by red circles in Figure 3). However, a closer look at how this aligns with known vulnerabilities reveals that even this case reflects unnecessary exposure.

### Analysis of CVEs

Figure 4 depicts the number of publicly known OpenSSL CVEs, particularly those of moderate or high severity (severity data is only available after August 2014), that apply to each version of the Nest Learning Thermostat. Unsurprisingly, the periods corresponding to the red circles in Figure 3 are not vulnerable, but this state is short-lived, as multiple vulnerabilities emerge within a few months. Importantly, most of these CVEs could be avoided if the firmware used the latest OpenSSL version.

### Hardware Architecture

Many devices in our dataset are Unix-based systems, with 88.46% and 46.15% including BusyBox and Linux Kernel libraries, respectively. Teardowns of high-end smart devices often reveal powerful ARM processors, supporting our findings. Budget-oriented devices, however, may prefer alternative microcontrollers such as ESP32 and ESP8266, commonly found in light bulbs and plugs. Our dataset might under-represent lower-end devices for two reasons: they may use libraries provided by chip makers royalty-free, and we had difficulty finding open-source compliance notices from lesser-known vendors.

### Key Takeaways and Limitations

Our measurement results highlight concerning statistics about the current state of third-party library management in IoT devices. Even market-leading vendors such as Nest and D-Link often fail to update their dependent libraries promptly, resulting in unnecessary exposure to known vulnerabilities. While our data collection methodology is limited to open-source GPL libraries, we aim to shed light on the existing state of IoT library mismanagement using these libraries as indicators.
