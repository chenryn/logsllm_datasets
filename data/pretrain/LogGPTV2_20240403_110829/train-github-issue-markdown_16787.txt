### Current Behavior:
I'm currently in the middle of trying to create a patch build for my prod env
and my builds are failing because my lock file is not pinning my internal git
dependencies like it used to. It also takes 5mins vs npm 6's 15sec.
### Expected Behavior:
The lock file is respected and only it is consulted... no updates, no
resolutions, no healing.
### Steps To Reproduce:
Install a project that has a git dependency... observe the lock file has a git
hash. Blow away the node_modules, use `npm ci` after making some obvious
change in the git dependency and observe the locked version without the change
is not present and the latest is.
### Environment:
OS: linux  
node: 15.12.0  
npm: 7.8.0 (tested all the way back to 7.6...) npm 6 works as expected.
