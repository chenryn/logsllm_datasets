I copied code from an official example
(http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_materials_normalmap.html) to
do an globe with displacement mapping (http://threejs.thiele-
medien.de/index_.html).  
Everything seems to be fine, but could this be avoided?
In both Im getting multiple console warnings, this is the output of the
official example :
