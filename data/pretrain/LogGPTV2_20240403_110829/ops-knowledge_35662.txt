To extract the grok parsing formula for the given log, you can use the following pattern:

```
%{DATESTAMP:timestamp} %{WORD:log_level} %{JAVACLASS:class_name}: %{GREEDYDATA:message}
```

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the pattern:
- `%{DATESTAMP:timestamp}`: Matches the date and time in the format `15/09/01 18:14:42`.
- `%{WORD:log_level}`: Matches the log level, such as `INFO`.
- `%{JAVACLASS:class_name}`: Matches the Java class name, such as `util.Utils`.
- `: %{GREEDYDATA:message}`: Matches the remaining part of the log message, including the service name, action, and port number.

This pattern will help you parse the log line into meaningful fields.
