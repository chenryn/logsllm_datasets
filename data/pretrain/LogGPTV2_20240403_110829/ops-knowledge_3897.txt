Assistant: Establishing an automated testing process can maximize the quality and efficiency of software releases. The following are specific steps: 1. Determine the scope of testing: determine the scope and objectives of testing, including which functions, scenarios, and system environments. 2. Design test cases: According to the test scope and objectives, design test cases to ensure that each function point is covered and tested. 3. Select an automated testing tool: Choose an automated testing tool that suits your company's business needs. 4. Write automated test scripts: According to the test cases, write automated test scripts to automate the execution of test work. 5. Integrated testing tools and version control system: Integrate automated testing tools and version control systems to ensure test results and code change tracking. 6. Design automated test reports: Generate automated test reports based on test results for management and developers to view results. 7. Continuously optimize the automated testing process: According to the requirements and test results, continuously optimize the automated testing process to improve the quality and efficiency of software release. In short, the establishment of an automated testing process needs to be considered and implemented in terms of scope, test cases, tool selection, scripting, integration, reporting, and optimization to ensure the integrity and reliability of the automated testing process.
