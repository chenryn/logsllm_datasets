User: I have Python 3.2 installed by default on my Raspbian Linux, but I want Python 3.4 (time.perf_counter, yield from, etc.). Installing Python 3.4 via apt-get is no problem, but when i type python3 in my shell I still get Python 3.2 (since /usr/bin/python3 still links to it). Should I change the Symlink, or is there a better was to do this?
Assistant: I'm going to answer my own question, since I have found a solution to my problem. I had previously run apt-get upgrade on my system after setting my debian release to jessie. This did not replace python 3.2 though. What did replace it was running apt-get dist-upgrade; after that apt-get autoremove removed python 3.2. I doubt that this could be a problem, since I hadn't installed any external libraries.
