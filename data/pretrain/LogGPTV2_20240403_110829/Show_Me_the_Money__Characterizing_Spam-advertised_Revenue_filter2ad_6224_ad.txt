ity from the countries originating the most visits. This
observation reinforces the conclusion that non-Western
audiences offer ineffective targets for such advertising.
Finally, we also notice signiﬁcant differences be-
tween the drug selection habits of Americans com-
pared to customers from Canada and Western Europe.
In particular, we divide the EvaPharmacy formulary
into two broad categories: lifestyle drugs (deﬁned as
drugs commonly used recreationally, including “male-
enhancement” items plus Human Growth Hormone,
Soma and Tramadol) and non-lifestyle (all others, in-
cluding birth control pills). We ﬁnd that while U.S. cus-
tomers select non-lifestyle items 33% of the time, Cana-
dian and Western-European customer selections concen-
trate far more in the lifestyle category—only 8% of all
items placed in a shopping cart are non-lifestyle items.
We surmise that this discrepancy may arise due to differ-
ences in health care regimes; drugs easily justiﬁed to a
physician may be fully covered under state health plans
in Canada and Western Europe, leaving an external mar-
ket only for lifestyle products. Conversely, a subset of
uninsured or under-insured customers in the U.S. may
view spam-advertised, no-prescription-required pharma-
cies as a competitive market for meeting their medical
needs. To further underscore this point, we observe that
85% of all non-lifestyle drugs are selected by U.S. visi-
tors.
5 Revenue estimation
Combining the results from estimates on the order rate
per program and estimates of the shopping cart makeup,
we now estimate total revenue on a per-program basis.
5.1 Average price per order
The revenue model underlying our analysis is simple: we
multiply the estimated order rate by the average price per
order to arrive at a total revenue ﬁgure over a given unit

who added an item to their shopping cart.
This in turn explains why such online pharmacies
maintain a comprehensive inventory: not only does a full
formulary lend legitimacy, but it also represents a signif-
icant source of potential revenue.
We also comprehensively crawled an EvaPharmacy
site for pricing data and calculated the minimum esti-
mated revenue per purchase (also shown for the top 18
products in Table 3a). Combining this data with our mea-
surement of item popularity, we calculate a minimum
weighted-average item cost of $76 plus $15 for shipping
and handling. This weighted average assumes visitors al-
ways select the minimum-priced item for any given pur-
chase, and that the ﬁnal purchases have the same distri-
bution as for items added to the user’s shopping cart.
4.4 Customer distribution
We next examine the geographic component of the Eva-
Pharmacy customer base. Figure 6 shows the geolocated
origin for all shopping cart additions. We observe that
EvaPharmacy has a vast advertising reach, producing site
visits from 229 distinct countries or territories. However,

of time. However, we do not know, on a per-program ba-
sis, the actual average purchase price. Thus, we explore
three different approximations, all of which we believe
are conservative.
First, for on-line pharmacies we use the static value of
roughly $100 as reported in our previous “Spamalytics”
study [10]. However, this study only considered one par-
ticular site, covered only 28 customers, and was unable
to handle more than a single item placed in a cart (i.e.,
it could not capture information about customers buying
multiple items).
We also consider a second approximation based on the
minimum priced item (including shipping) on the site for
each program under study. Since sites can have enormous
catalogs, we restrict the set of items under considera-
tion as follows. For pharmacy sites, we consider the top
18 most popular items as determined by the analysis of
EvaPharmacy in § 4 (these top 18 items constituted 66%
of order volume in our analysis). For each of these items
present in the target pharmacy, we ﬁnd the minimum-
priced instance (i.e., lowest dosage and quantity) and use
the overall minimum as our per-order price. For small
deviations between pharmacy formularies (e.g., differ-
ent Viagra store-brand variants) we simply substitute one
item for the other. We repeat this same process for soft-
ware, but since we do not have a reference set of most
popular items for this market, we simply use the de-
clared “bestsellers” at each site (16 at Royal Software,
36 and SoftSales and 76 at EuroSoft)—again using the
minimum priced item to represent the average price per
order.
Finally, we calculate a “basket-weighted average”
price using measured popularity data. For pharmacies we
again consider the 18 most popular EvaPharmacy items
and extract the overlap set with other pharmacies. Us-
ing the relative frequency of elements in this intersec-
tion, we calculate a popularity vector that we then use
to weight the minimum item price; we use the sum of
these weights as the average price per order. Intuitively,
this approach tries to accommodate the fact that prod-
uct’s have non-uniform popularity, while still using the
conservative assumption that users order the minimum
dosage and quantity for each item. Note that we implic-
itly assume that the distribution of drug popularity holds
roughly the same between online pharmacies.10
We repeated this analysis, as before, with site-declared
best-selling software packages. To gauge relative popu-
larity, we searched a large BitTorrent metasearch engine
(isohunt.com), which indexes 541 sites tracking over
6.5 million torrents. We assigned a popularity to each
software item in proportion to the sum of the seeders and
leechers on all torrents matching a given product name.
We then weighted the total prices (inclusive of any han-
dling charge) by this popularity metric to arrive at an es-
timate of the average order price.
10One data point supporting this view is Rx–Promotion’s rank-
ordered list of best selling drugs. The ten most popular items sold by
both pharmacies are virtually the same and ranked in the same order.
