User: I want to test my django app in my WAMP server. The idea is that i want to create a web app for aaa.com and aaa.co.uk, if the user enter the domain aaa.co.uk, my django app will serve the UK version, if the user go to aaa.com, the same django app will serve the US version (different frontend). Basically i will be detecting the host of the user and serve the correct templates.
How do i setup my WAMP so i can test this? right now i am using pyCharm default server which is 127.0.0.1:8000
