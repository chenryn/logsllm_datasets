### Payment Method Fluctuations

During the Stable period, the order of payment methods remained relatively constant, with the exception of Cashapp in April 2019 and January 2020, when it briefly surpassed Amazon Giftcards and USD to become the third most popular method, before quickly reverting. Bitcoin exhibited the most significant fluctuations, with notable peaks in April 2019 and January 2020.

### Impact of the Covid-19 Era

In the Covid-19 era, the monthly values for most payment methods increased. Bitcoin's value rose by approximately 90% compared to the end of the Stable period. During this time, Cashapp also outpaced PayPal, Amazon Giftcards, and USD, becoming the second most preferred payment method. The largest observed difference between Bitcoin and PayPal occurred at the end of this era (June 2020), with Bitcoin's total value being eight times higher than PayPal's.

### Product Trading Trends

Giftcards consistently ranked as the top traded category. In the Set-up period, there was a notable increase in hacking/programming transactions in October 2018, reaching nearly $10,000, due to high-value contracts that were verified. Peaks for accounts/licenses and social network boosts also occurred in November 2018. During the Stable period, the value of giftcards gradually declined, reaching its lowest point by the end of this era. Other categories fluctuated but generally remained below $2,000, except for a sudden rise in hacking/programming in January 2020, which was also confirmed to be accurate.

During the Covid-19 era, all top five product categories experienced a temporary increase followed by a decline. While giftcards and tutorials/guides were immediately affected in the first month, hacking/programming and social network boosts remained stable for the first few months before peaking and then dropping.

### Longitudinal Analysis

#### Latent Class Transition

To gain insights into user behavior and patterns in the marketplace, we employed Latent Transition Modelling (LTM) [14] to identify latent classes within the data. LTM is a longitudinal application of Latent Class Analysis, which uses clustering to find latent groups sharing similar characteristics and assigns group membership to the items in our dataset. This approach helps us understand how cooperation evolves over time and assess the representativeness of our data and market structure.

By creating a Latent Transition Model, we can track how users move between classes over time and how they change throughout the market's lifetime. Each month's activity for each user is treated as a separate case. Using a Poisson curve (due to non-overdispersed count data), the most accurate and parsimonious model (per AIC and BIC) is a 12-class model. This distills market activity down to 12 types of users, summarized in Table 6, and assesses their contribution to different types of activity.

We applied the model to the three eras, focusing on the contribution of different classes to marketplace activity over time rather than the total number of individuals in each class. This allowed us to explore, for example, the proportion of Exchange transactions made by a small number of 'big fish' versus those made by large numbers of bit players at a given period. To establish the links between makers and takers, we also reported on 'flows' in each era, providing details of the three maker-taker pairs accounting for the highest percentage of each contract type (summarized in Table 8 in the Appendix). We ignored Trade and Vouch Copy as they accounted for small proportions of contracts. Disputed transactions were low (around 1%) for most of this period, peaking to 2-3% in the last six months of the Set-up era.

#### Set-up Era

The class distribution of those making and accepting Exchange was roughly similar, with most classes who made contracts also accepting contracts made by others. Initially, the exchange market was dominated by a large number of users participating in only one or two transactions (Figure 12). Around two-thirds of Exchange involved these users, with the remaining third involving 'power-users'. After the first six months, the growth in Exchange was largely driven by small numbers of power-users, who by the end accounted for the majority of transactions.

For Purchase, the overall transaction volume ramped up steadily across the Set-up period. Unlike Exchange, there was a clear division between 'maker' and 'taker' classes, with little overlap. The majority of Purchase transactions were made by two classes: H (a medium-class making an average of 10 Purchases per month, with some participation in Exchange) and J (a low-volume class making around 1 Purchase and accepting 1 Sale per month). Conversely, accepting Purchase was dominated by low-volume users from class C (who accepted a single Purchase per month on average) (Figure 13). This changed in the last six months of the Set-up period, with a rise in prominence of class E in accepting transactions (one of our exchanger power-user classes).

For Sale, the majority of transactions were made by class C (small-scale users making a single Sale per month on average and nothing else). Takers of Sale were dominated by class J (small-scale users accepting a single Sale transaction). This arrangement, with large numbers of small-scale users selling to one another on a one-to-one basis, continued for most of this era.

#### Stable Era

The transition between the Set-up and Stable eras saw a rush of small-scale users making small numbers of Sales. An initial peak after contracts became compulsory was followed by a slow downward trend. There was a small spike in Purchase and Exchange around Christmas/New Year 2019.

Exchange remained relatively stable, with the class mix for making and accepting continuing to reflect the end of the Set-up era. There was a rapid transition at the beginning of the Stable era, with Sale volumes roughly quadrupling over three months for class C users (small-scale users making a single Sale). On the taker side, we saw a more pronounced change, with small-scale exchangers accepting about the same number as during the Set-up era, while two new classes emerged: L (power-users accepting an average of 54 Sales per month) and A (a medium-user class accepting 10 Sales per month).

The distribution of Purchase changed little during the Stable era. The main change related to takers, with a short-term initial growth in classes I (a medium-scale class with an interest in a variety of transactions) and K (an Exchange power-user class that also accepts medium numbers of Sale and Purchase), which dropped off after four months. For Sale, we observed a sustained increase in users making single transactions, being accepted by a large increase in a new class, L (Sale power-users), and an existing one, A (Sale medium-level users), with most of the market being split between these two. Disputes dropped at the start of this era to around half or a third of their previous proportion of contracts (around 1%).

#### Covid-19 Era

This era brought significant changes to the market, with a large increase in all three contract types (Exchange, Purchase, and Sale). There was a large influx of class C users, who made a single Sale. We observed increases in contracts across classes B, D, G, and L, all of which are small-volume exchange classes except for G. Increases in accepted Exchange were concentrated in classes B and K (exchanger power-users). For Purchase, increases in contracts made were split between small-scale (A class) users and mid-level users (H), while for Purchase accepted, increases were across classes C, B, D, and E (all small-scale users). Increases in Sale were focused in two classes: small-time users (class C) making Sales and sale power-users (class L) accepting them.

### Cold Start Problem

New members, or "cold starters," face the challenge of getting started in the market, establishing reputation, and building a customer base. We used clustering and qualitative analysis to investigate how users in the Stable era overcame the 'cold start' problem. We then used Zero-inflated Poisson regression to explore the role of trust and reputation for cold starters across all three eras.

#### Cold Start Variables

For modeling, our choice of predictor variables was informed by the literature on trust in underground markets, including users' positive and negative ratings, number of disputed transactions, and length of participation since the first active post [11, 16, 27]. Control variables included the number of posts in the marketplace and the number of contracts initiated and accepted, to control for users' level of activity and social ties [7, 11].

#### Clustering

We used k-means clustering and the cold start variables to examine groups within a subset of members who accepted their first contract in the Stable era. We limited this analysis to the Stable era, as during the Set-up era, many actors had a presence in the marketplace before the contract system began. We found that two clusters best fit our dataset. The first cluster contained the majority (97.7%) of members, with a median of one accepted contract and seven posts. The second cluster, significantly smaller (2.3% of members), had a median of 49 accepted contracts and 279 posts, characterized by a greater amount of market activity.

Despite standardizing our variables (zero mean and variance of 1) to give them equal weight, our dataset was skewed, which influenced the clustering results.
