month. During Stable, there is no significant change in the order
of these methods, except for Cashapp in April 2019 and January
2020, when it outpaces Amazon Giftcards and USD, becomes the
third-highest method, then slips back quickly. The most fluctuating
method during this era is Bitcoin, with two peaks in April 2019
and January 2020. During Covid-19, the monthly values increase
across most payment methods, with Bitcoin climbing around 90%
higher compared to the end of Stable. In this era, we see Cashapp
outpacing PayPal, Amazon Giftcards and USD to become the second
highest wanted payment method. The largest observed difference
between Bitcoin and PayPal is at the end of this era (June 2020),
when total Bitcoin value is eight times higher than PayPal.
There is a more complex fluctuation with regards to products
traded. Overall, giftcard is consistently the top category. In Set-up,
we observe an increase of hacking/programming in October 2018,
reaching nearly $10,000. This was due to some high value contracts,
which we manually checked and concluded were actual trades.
The peaks for accounts/licenses and social network boost also hap-
pen in November 2018. During Stable, giftcard gradually declines,
reaching the lowest value at the end of this era. The others change
frequently, but not significantly, ranging mostly under $2,000, ex-
cept a sudden lift of hacking/programming on January 2020. We
manually checked this increase, again confirming it is likely to be
correct. We observe a raise then decline in all top five products dur-
ing Covid-19. While giftcard and tutorials/guides are immediately
affected in the first month of this era, hacking/programming and
social network boost stay mostly unchanged in the first couple of
months before peaking (then dropping) in the month after.
5 LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS
In this section, we use statistical modelling approaches to examine
the longitudinal evolution of the marketplace through the three
eras then address the ‘cold start’ problem.
5.1 Latent Class Transition
To generate insights into the kinds of users and patterns of be-
haviour in the market, we use Latent Transition Modelling (LTM)
559
[14] to identify latent ‘classes’ within the data. LTM involves a
longitudinal application of Latent Class Analysis, a statistical mod-
elling technique which uses clustering to find latent groups in data
which share similar characteristics, and to assign group member-
ship to the items in our dataset. In this case, we classify users at a
point in time, based on the number of transactions they make of
different kinds. This is crucial to understanding how co-operation
evolves over time in this marketplace and allows us to assess the
representativeness of our data and the structure of the market –
for example, whether the activity we observe represents a large
number of small-time users or is dominated by a few key players.
By creating a Latent Transition Model, we can additionally un-
derstand how users move between classes over time and how they
change across the lifetime of the market. The model treats each
month’s activity for each user as a separate case. Using a Poisson
curve (due to non-overdispersed count data), the most accurate and
parsimonious (per AIC and BIC) is a 12-class model. Effectively,
this distils the complexity of market activity down to 12 types of
users (summarised in Table 6) and assesses their contribution to
different types of activity.
We apply the model to the three eras, focusing on the contribu-
tion of different classes to marketplace activity over time (rather
than the total number of individuals in each class). Thus, we re-
port on the total number of transactions over time made by users
exhibiting different classes of behaviour. This allows us to explore,
for example, the proportion of Exchange made by a small number
of ‘big fish’ versus those made by large numbers of bit players at
a given period in time. To establish the links between makers and
takers, we also report on ‘flows’ in each of the eras (summarised in
Table 8 in the Appendix), providing details of the three maker-taker
pairs accounting for the highest percentage of each contract type
in a given era. We ignore Trade and Vouch Copy as they account
for small proportions of contracts. We see low levels of disputed
transactions (around 1%) for most of this period, but these peak to
2-3% for the last six months of Set-up.
The Set-up Era. The class distribution of those making and ac-
cepting Exchange is roughly similar, with most classes who make
contracts also accepting contracts made by others. At first, the
exchange market is dominated by a large number of users who
participate in only one or two transactions (Figure 12). Around
two-thirds of Exchange involve these users, with the remaining
third involving ‘power-users’. After the first six months, the growth
in Exchange is largely driven by small numbers of power-users,
who by the end account for the majority of transactions. In this era,

power-users and single exchangers are not well connected, with
most flow volumes trading within their own class types.
For Purchase, we observe a different story. Overall transaction
volume ramps up steadily across Set-up. In contrast to Exchange,
there is a clear division between ‘maker’ and ‘taker’ classes, with
little overlap. The majority of Purchase are made by two classes:
H (a medium-class making on average 10 Purchase a month, with
some participation in Exchange); and J (a low-volume class making
around 1 Purchase and accepts 1 Sale every month). Conversely,
accepting Purchase is dominated by low-volume users from class
C (who accept a single Purchase per month on average) (Figure 13).
This changes over the last six months of Set-up, with a rise in promi-
nence of class E in accepting transactions (one of our exchanger
power-user classes).
We again observe very different class participation in making
and accepting Sale. The majority of transactions are made by class
C (small-scale users who make a single Sale per month on aver-
age and nothing else). In Set-up, takers of Sale are dominated by
class J (small-scale users who accept a single sale transaction). This
arrangement, of large numbers of small-scale users selling to one
another on a one-to-one basis and in a relatively focused manner,
continues for most of this era.
The Stable Era.The transition between Set-up and Stable sees a
rush of small-scale users making small numbers of Sale. An initial
peak after contracts became compulsory is followed by a slow
downward trend. We see a small spike in Purchase and Exchange
around Christmas/New Year 2019.
Exchange remains relatively stable, with the class mix for mak-
ing and accepting continuing to reflect the end of Set-up. There is
a rapid transition at the beginning of Stable, with Sale roughly
quadrupling in volume over three months for class C users (small-
scale users making a single sale). On the taker side, we see a starker

IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
change in the users accepting Sale. While small-scale exchangers
accept about the same number as they did during Set-up, two new
classes emerge: L (power-users accepting on average 54 Sale per
month); and A (a medium-user class accepting 10 Sale per month).
The distribution of Purchase changes little during the Stable
era. The main change relates to takers, with a short-term initial
growth in classes I (a medium-scale class with an interest in a
variety of transaction) and K (an Exchange power-user class that
also accepts medium numbers of Sale and Purchase) which drops
off after four months. For Sale, we observe a sustained increase in
users making single transactions being accepted by a large increase
in a new class, L (Sale power-users) and an existing one, A (Sale
medium-level users), with most of the market being split between
these two. We see disputes drop at the start of this era to around
half or third their previous proportion of contracts (around 1%).
The Covid-19 Era. This era heralds changes to the market, with
a large increase in all three contract types (Exchange, Purchase,
and Sale). There is a large influx in class C users, who make a single
Sale. We observe increases in contracts across classes B, D, G, and
L, all of which are small-volume exchange classes apart from G.
Increases in accepted Exchange are concentrated in classes B and
K (exchanger power-users). For Purchase, increases in contracts
made are split between small-scale (A class) users and mid-level
users (H), while for Purchase accepted, increases are across classes
C, B, D, and E (all small-scale users). Increases in Sale are focused
in two classes: small-time users (class C) making Sale and sale
power-users (class L) accepting them.
5.2 Cold Start Problem
New members – cold starters – face the challenge of getting started
on the market, establishing reputation and building up a customer
base. We use clustering and qualitative analysis to investigate how
users in Stable overcome the ‘cold start’ problem. We then use
Zero-inflated Poisson regression to explore the role of trust and
reputation for cold starters across all three eras.
Cold Start Variables. For modelling, our choice of predictor vari-
ables is informed by the literature on trust in underground markets,
and include users’ positive and negative ratings, number of dis-
puted transactions, and length of participation since first active
post [11, 16, 27]. Included as control variables are the number of
posts in the marketplace and the number of contracts initiated and
accepted, to control for users’ level of activity and social ties [7, 11].
For clustering, we use the predictor and control variables.
Clustering. We use k-means clustering and the cold start variables
to examine groups within a subset of members who accepted their
first contract in Stable, our second era of analysis. We limit this
analysis to Stable, as during Set-up many actors had a presence
in the marketplace before the contract system began. We find two
clusters are the best fit for our dataset. The first cluster contains
the majority (97.7%) of members. These users have a median of one
accepted contract and seven posts. The second cluster is signifi-
cantly smaller, containing 2.3% of members, with a median of 49
accepted contracts and 279 posts. Thus, this cluster is characterised
by a greater amount of market activity.
Despite standardising our variables (zero mean and variance of
1) to give them equal weight, our dataset is skewed, which has
