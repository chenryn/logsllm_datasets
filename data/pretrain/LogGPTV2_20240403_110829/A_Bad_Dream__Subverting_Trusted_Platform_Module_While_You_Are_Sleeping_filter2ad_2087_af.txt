### The TCG Specifications and Trust Chain Creation

The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specifications detail the creation and maintenance of a trust chain based on interactions between the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and the Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM). As the specifications have evolved, more technologies and manufacturers have become involved, leading to increased complexity in the measurement process. This complexity has resulted in logical conflicts and incompleteness within the specifications, potentially providing poor guidance to vendors for implementation.

### Vulnerabilities Addressed in This Paper

In this paper, we address vulnerabilities that allow an adversary to reset the TPM and forge Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). One vulnerability stems from a flawed specification, affecting many commodity devices. The other vulnerability arises from an implementation defect in the popular open-source MLE (Measured Launch Environment) for Intel TXT.

We have developed and demonstrated attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities using commodity products. We have informed the hardware manufacturers about our findings, and they are expected to produce and deploy patches. Additionally, we have created a patch for the open-source project, which has already been merged.
