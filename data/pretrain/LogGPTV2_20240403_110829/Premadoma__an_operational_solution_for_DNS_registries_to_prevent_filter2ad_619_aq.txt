that they were evaluated on very different data sets and on different
TLDs. This would constitute interesting future work.
In line with the goal of our work, several other studies aim to
reduce the time necessary to stop abuse by identifying related ma-
licious domains. Felegyhzi et al. [5] investigated the feasibility of
proactive domain blacklisting, by inferring other malicious registra-
tions from known-bad domains through shared name servers and
identical registration times. Premadoma leverages this concept of
facilitators in a more generic way as part of the reputation-based
classification, and applies this approach to registration-time pre-
vention.
Many studies concentrate on DNS traffic of newly registered
domains to detect malicious behavior [1–3, 8, 17, 23, 24]. For in-
stance, Xu et al. [24] use passive DNS data to predict malicious
behavior, and Weber et al. [23] evaluated a number of different
clustering techniques for identifying malicious domain campaigns.
These systems generally focus on the operational DNS patterns
of domain names, while Premadoma engages in an earlier stage,
before the domain is in use. A recent study by Vissers et al. [21] re-
vealed that approximately 20% of domain registrations by malicious
actors are not picked up by blacklists, stressing the importance of
alternatives to blacklisting, as well as explaining the sometimes
higher than expected False Positive Rates, as a significant fraction
of False Positives are actually True Positives that did not end up on
blacklists.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented Premadoma, a system for DNS reg-
istries to predict malicious domain registrations at registration time.
This system takes a novel approach by simultaneously focusing
on recurring patterns in registrant information as well as target-
ing commonly used registration facilitators. Using this approach,
Premadoma substantially lowers the success rate of malicious reg-
istrations and facilitator reuse, and hinders the sustainability of run-
ning large-scale malicious campaigns. We thoroughly evaluated the
proposed prediction model’s performance and adaptability on an
11 month testing set, and addressed complex and domain-specific
dataset challenges, such as coping with incomplete coverage of
blacklists. Since the successful deployment at the .eu ccTLD reg-
istry, Premadoma already contributed to the takedown of 58,966
malicious registrations and has lead to a remarkable decline in
malicious domain registrations.
