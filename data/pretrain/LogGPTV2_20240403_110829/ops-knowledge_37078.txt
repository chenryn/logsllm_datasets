When using `args=['e:\\lynx\\lynx.exe', '-dump', some_url]` with `subprocess.check_output`, the command executes successfully if the current working directory is `e:\lynx`. However, if the current working directory is different, it fails and raises a `CalledProcessException` with a return code of -1. I do not want to add `e:\lynx` to the system's PATH for now. Do you have any suggestions?

One possible solution is to change the current working directory to `e:\lynx` within your Python script before calling `subprocess.check_output`. This can be done using the `os` module. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
import os
import subprocess

# Define the target directory
target_dir = 'e:\\lynx'

# Change the current working directory
os.chdir(target_dir)

# Run the subprocess
try:
    output = subprocess.check_output(['lynx.exe', '-dump', some_url])
    print(output.decode('utf-8'))
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This approach ensures that the working directory is set to `e:\lynx` when the subprocess is called, which should resolve the issue without modifying the system's PATH.
