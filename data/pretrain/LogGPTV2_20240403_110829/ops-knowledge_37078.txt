User: With args=['e:\\lynx\\lynx.exe','-dump',some_url], 
subprocess.check_output works fine if the current-directory is e:\lynx.
Elsewhere, it fails with a CalledProcessException and retcode of -1.
For now, I do not wish to add e:\lynx to PATH.
Any thoughts?
Assistant: Is there a problem in making the current directory e:\\lynx from withing python? That seems like a good solution to me.
