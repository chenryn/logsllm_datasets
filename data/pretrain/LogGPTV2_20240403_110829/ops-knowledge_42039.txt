User: According to the following server specifications, design a suitable virtualization environment to meet the system requirements. CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2667 v4 @ 3.20GHz x 2\\nMemory: 128GB DDR4\\nHard disk: 4TB SATA3.0 (7200 rpm) x 4\\nNetwork card: Gigabit Ethernet x 4\\nAssistant: Based on the above server specifications, it is recommended to use virtualization software VMware vSphere or Citrix XenServer to create a virtualized environment. For CPU and memory resources, resources can be allocated according to the number of virtual machines and load requirements. For example, CPU cores and memory size can be allocated on demand to meet the needs of virtual machines, and combined with the management function of virtualization software, the purpose of dynamically allocating resources between virtual machines can be achieved. In addition, RAID 10 should be used to ensure data security and high reliability. For network cards, NIC Teaming technology can be used to achieve aggregation to improve network throughput and reliability.
