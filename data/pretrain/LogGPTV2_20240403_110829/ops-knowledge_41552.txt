User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Secure way to log in to a website on someone else's computer Suppose I am in a situation that I am forced to log in to my account using someone else's computer. Is there any secure way to do that so that I would be sure that my login details (i.e. password) are not recorded by any means (e.g. keystroke logging)? Or if it is impossible, what are the ways to at least mitigate the risks?

Although related, but note that this is a bit different from this question since I am not using my own computer to log in.

Assistant: This is an interesting question!

The rule of thumb is that if someone else has control of the device (and they're determined enough), they will always be able to monitor and modify all of your actions on the device.

We can (to a somewhat limited extent) get around this though! Two-factor authentication can be used to ensure that even if someone has your password, they cannot get into your account without also having access to a separate device (owned and controlled by you).

Keep in mind that once you log in, the computer ultimately has control over your interaction with the website, and as a result it could trivially see everything you do on the site and even modify your requests to the site (including not logging you out properly when you're done, and potentially changing your login details to lock you out of your own account).

This all depends on how worried you are about being attacked - if you're just logging into Facebook on a friends computer, you can probably trust that when you hit "Log Out", it actually logs you out. If you're logging into something really important, however, you may want to stick to devices you control.

Additionally, consider the following, via user TemporalWolf


  Some websites allow for the generation of single-use one time passwords which sidesteps any sort of password logging... as you mentioned, this doesn't stop them from mucking with the now authenticated session.
