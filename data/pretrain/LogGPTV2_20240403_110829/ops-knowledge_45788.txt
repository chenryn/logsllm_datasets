User: I have already created a 64-bit program for windows using cx freeze on a 64-bit machine. I am using Windows 7 64-bit Home premium. py2exe is not working because as i understand it does not work with python 3.2.2 yet. Is there an option i have to specify in cx freeze to compile in 32-bit instead of 64-bit.
Thanks!
Assistant: To produce 32 bit executables you need to install 32-bit versions of Python and cx_freeze.
