User: Please provide an LDAP based user authentication and authorization scheme.
Assistant: LDAP-based user authentication and authorization schemes are as follows: 1. Establish an LDAP server: first establish an LDAP server, and store user information and authorization information in this server. 2. Configure LDAP server: Configure user and group information in the LDAP server, including user ID, password, name, email address, etc. 3. Configure the application: set the LDAP server information in the application, such as domain name, port, user name and password, etc. 4. User Authentication: When a user logs into the application, the application will use the LDAP server for authentication. First, the application sends the user ID and password to the LDAP server. The LDAP server will verify that the user ID and password match, and if so, the LDAP server will return a successful authentication message to the application. 5. User authorization: Once the user successfully logs in, the application will use the LDAP server for user authorization. The application will query the LDAP server to find the groups and permission information the user belongs to. The LDAP server will return information about the groups the user belongs to, and the application will use this information to authorize the user's access rights in a group-based permission control model. 6. Authorization management: Put all user and group information in the LDAP server for easy user and authorization management. By using LDAP management tools, user and group information can be easily added, deleted or modified, thereby simplifying authority management.
