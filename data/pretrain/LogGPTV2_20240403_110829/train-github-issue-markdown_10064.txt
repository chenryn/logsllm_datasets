### Apache Airflow version
2.5.3
### What happened
When trying to view the logs for a task on a manual DAG run I get a nasty
error:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py", line 2529, in wsgi_app

      File "/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/www/views.py", line 193, in get_date_time_num_runs_dag_runs_form_data
        date_time = dagrun.execution_date
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'execution_date'
Looking through the code I can see it is failing to find the dag_run. The
cause of this is because the run_id is set to the string:
    manual__2023-04-26T18:18:28.720589 00:00
but in the db its actually:
    manual__2023-04-26T18:18:28.720589+00:00
(notice the absence of the plus for the timezone separator).
As a hack and to prove this was the issue I modified line 1390 in
airflow/models/dag.py from:
    query = query.filter(DagRun.dag_id == self.dag_id, DagRun.run_id == run_id)
to:
    query = query.filter(DagRun.dag_id == self.dag_id, DagRun.run_id == run_id.replace(' 00:00', '+00:00'))
### What you think should happen instead
The log files for my task should have been presented to me in their full
glory.
### How to reproduce
Initiate a manual run of a task. Let it finish.  
Click the "success" icon from the home screen for the dag  
Click the "run_id" value for the latest run.
### Operating System
CENTOS_MANTISBT_PROJECT="CentOS-7" CENTOS_MANTISBT_PROJECT_VERSION="7"
REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="centos" REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="7"
### Deployment
Virtualenv installation
### Deployment details
This was upgraded from an unused install of airflow v2.1.2 although there were
no previously run DAGs and this happens on new run so I dont think its an
issue related to the migration of data.
Python 3.9.9
### Anything else
Happens every time.
