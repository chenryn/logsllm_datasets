Question: During a security audit of a web application, it was discovered that the application allows for the batch upload of files without proper validation. The development team proposes to implement a deny list of file extensions to block known malicious file types. As a security consultant, what would be the most effective counterargument to this proposed remediation strategy?
"A": "A deny list approach may not be comprehensive and can be circumvented by attackers who use unconventional file extensions or disguise malicious files with accepted extensions.",
"B": "Deny lists enhance security by providing a clear list of unacceptable file types, which makes it easier for the application to block malicious uploads.",
"C": "Using a deny list is more resource-efficient than other methods and will improve the application's performance during file uploads.",
"D": "A deny list is unnecessary since modern web browsers are capable of detecting and blocking malicious file uploads automatically."
Answer: A
