ments, which contain latencies from all ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© locations
to all rings. We observed that the distribution of RIPE Atlas probe
latencies is overall somewhat lower than that of Microsoft‚Äôs users
globally (not shown in figure), so Figure 4a likely underestimates
the latency users typically experience.
Users can experience up to 1,000 ms in anycast latency per page
load, and, for large deployments (e.g., R95 ), half of RIPE Atlas
probes experience approximately 100 ms of latency per page load
(Fig. 4a). Therefore, unsurprisingly, latency to Microsoft‚Äôs CDN
factors into user experience, and so Microsoft has an incentive to
decrease latency for users. The difference in median latency per
page load between R28 and R110 is approximately 100 ms, which
is a measure of how investments in more front-ends can help users.
Similarly, a root deployment with more sites tends to have lower
latency than a root deployment with fewer sites (¬ß7.2), but such
reductions in latency hardly affect user experience (¬ß4).
locations
Latency benefits with more sites are not uniform, and perfor-
mance falls into one of two ‚Äúgroups‚Äù ‚Äì R28 and R47 have similar
aggregate performance, as do R74 , R95 , and R110 . This group-
ing corresponds to the way rings ‚Äúcover‚Äù users ‚Äì R74 provides a
significant additional number of Microsoft users with a geographi-
cally close front-end over R47 (¬ß7.2).
To show how adding front-ends tends to help individual
‚ü®region, AS‚ü©
(in addition to aggregate perfor-
mance), Figure 4b shows the difference in median latency for
a ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location from one ring to the next larger ring,
calculated using CDN measurements (as opposed to RIPE Atlas
probes). Most ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© locations experience either equal or
better latency to the next largest ring, with diminishing returns as
more front-ends are added. A small fraction of users experience
small increases in latency when moving to larger rings ‚Äì 90% of
users experience a decrease of at most a few millisecond increase
and 99% experience less than a 10 ms increase. Hence, Microsoft
does not sacrifice fairness for performance improvements.
We next investigate if Microsoft‚Äôs clear incentive to reduce la-
tency (and therefore inflation) translates to lower inflation from
users to Microsoft‚Äôs CDN than from users to the root DNS.
6 ANYCAST INFLATION CAN BE SMALL
We next investigate whether Microsoft‚Äôs incentive to reduce infla-
tion translates to an anycast deployment with less inflation than in
the roots, representing the study of anycast CDN inflation with the
best coverage to date ‚Äì measurements are from billions of users in
hundreds of countries/regions and 59,000 ASes. Critically, we are
able to directly compare inflation between root DNS and Microsoft‚Äôs
CDN, since we use the same methodology with broad coverage.
To measure anycast inflation for Microsoft‚Äôs CDN we use geo-
graphic information and server-side measurements (¬ß2.2). Server-
side logs give us a global view of which clients hit which front-ends
and the latencies they achieved. Latency is measured via server-side
logging of TCP round-trip times. Front-ends act as TCP proxies for
fetching un-cached content from data centers. Routing over the
global WAN is near optimal [36], so measuring inflation using la-
tency to front-ends (as opposed to measuring inflation using end to
end latency) captures all routing inefficiency. We also use Microsoft
user locations, which are determined using an internal database.
As in Section 3, we calculate both geographic and latency infla-
tion. We calculate geographic inflation as in Equation (1), except all
users in a ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location are assigned the mean location

which highlights that even though users have more low latency
options (front-ends), they can still take circuitous routes to close
front-ends. However, Microsoft is able to keep latency inflation
below 30 ms for 70% of users in all rings and below 60 ms for 90%
of users. In Microsoft‚Äôs CDN, 99% of users experience less than 100
ms of inflation, but 10% experience more than 100 ms to the roots.
An interesting takeaway from Figure 5b is that system-wide
per-query root DNS inflation is quite similar to CDN inflation, a
fact that is not clear from prior work [16, 51] since prior work used
different methodology and looked at fewer root letters. However,
inflation in individual root letters is quite worse than in Microsoft‚Äôs
CDN (Fig. 2b). Although inflation in the roots does not matter to
most users (¬ß4.3), it is still interesting to see how recursive resolvers
can take advantage of the thirteen independent deployments of
root letters, and choose which letter is the best for them, in a way
that is not possible in Microsoft‚Äôs CDN.
Compared to prior work which also studied inflation in Mi-
crosoft‚Äôs CDN [16], we find an improvement ‚Äì 95% of users experi-
ence inflation under 80 ms now compared to 85% 5 years ago. This
improvement (representing millions of users) is despite the fact
that Microsoft‚Äôs CDN has more than doubled in size and that we
use a stricter measure of inflation, and is evidence that expansion
reduces efficiency (in terms of % of users at their closest site) but
inflation can be kept low through careful deployment (¬ß7.2). Fig-
ure 5b also offers a complementary view of inflation compared to
prior work [16], which does not take into account that routing from
a ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location to all front-ends might be sub-optimal.
Compared to Figure 5a, Figure 5b demonstrates there is room
for improvement ‚Äì at least half of users visit their closest front-end,
but those users might take circuitous routes to those front-end as
shown by the low y-axis intercepts in Figure 5b. There is still room
for latency optimization in anycast deployments, which is an active
area of research [43, 47, 82].
7 INCENTIVES AND INVESTMENT SHAPE
DEPLOYMENTS AND PATHS
We have definitively answered the questions regarding inflation
that we posed at the end of Section 4.3. We now investigate why
inflation is so different in root DNS and Microsoft‚Äôs CDN by looking
at path lengths (¬ß7.1), investigate how geographical differences in
deployments affect inflation (¬ß7.2), and present reasons behind the
expansion of both root DNS and CDNs (¬ß7.3).
7.1 Microsoft‚Äôs CDN Has Shorter AS Paths, and
Short AS Paths are More Direct
CDNs have a financial incentive to keep latency low for users and
have the resources to build efficient systems. Microsoft deploys
state-of-the-art network routing automation [68, 80], a global SDN
WAN [36, 42], and expensive peering agreements when they make
economic sense and/or help user experience. These strategies result
in short, low latency routes between users and Microsoft.
We can capture some of these engineering efforts by measuring
how Microsoft connects to users. CDNs peer widely with end-user
networks and so have direct paths to many users [54, 78]. With
fewer BGP decision points, paths are often less inflated [70]. This
intuition motivates the following investigation of AS path lengths

CDN server side logs (5b). Inflation is more prevalent for larger
deployments but is still small for most users.
of users in the ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location. Anycast inflation results in
extra latency for every packet (and corresponding ACK) exchanged
between a client and an anycasted service, resulting in a per RTT
cost, so we refer to inflation as ‚Äúper RTT‚Äù. Application-layer inter-
actions may incur this cost multiple times (as in the case of loading
a large web object from a CDN) or a single time (as in the case of
typical DNS request/response over UDP).
Microsoft users usually experience no geographic inflation
(Fig. 5a, y-axis intercepts), and 85% of users experience less than
10 ms (1, 000 ùëòùëö) of geographic inflation per RTT for all rings.
Conversely, 97% of root DNS users experience some geographic
inflation, and 25% of users experience geographic inflation more
than 10 ms (1, 000 ùëòùëö) per RTT. The fact that geographic inflation
is larger and more prevalent in the roots than in Microsoft‚Äôs CDN
(at every percentile) suggests Microsoft optimizes its deployment
to control it (¬ß7).
We next calculate latency inflation for each ring as in Equa-
tion (2). We calculate median latencies over user populations
within a ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location hitting a front-end in a given ring,
the assumption being that measurements from some users in a
‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location hitting the same site are representative of
all users in that ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location hitting that site. More than
83% of such medians were taken over more than 500 measurements,
so our observations should be robust. There is roughly constant
latency inflation as the number of front-ends grows (Fig. 5b),

Figure 6: Distribution of the number of ASes traversed to reach
various destinations (6a) and the correlation between the AS path
length towards a destination and geographic inflation (6b). Microsoft
is closely connected to many eyeball ASes, and this connectivity

Microsoft by ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© locations, except for ‚ÄòAll Roots‚Äô which

towards roots and Microsoft and of how path lengths relate to infla-
tion, which is summarized by Figure 6. Figure 6 quantifies one key
difference between root DNS and CDN deployments, but publicly
available data cannot capture all of Microsoft‚Äôs optimizations.
To quantify differences in AS path length between Microsoft and
roots, Figure 6a shows AS path lengths to roots and Microsoft from
RIPE Atlas probes. We use the maximum number of active RIPE
Atlas probes for which we can calculate AS paths to all destinations,
amounting to 7,200 RIPE Atlas probes in 158 countries/regions and
2,400 ASes. Although RIPE Atlas probes do not have representative
coverage [10], it is the best publicly available system, and we are
only interested in qualitative, comparative conclusions.
Lengths towards Microsoft‚Äôs CDN are based on traceroutes from
active Atlas probes in August 2020, whereas lengths towards the
roots are based on traceroutes from RIPE Atlas probes in April
2018 (the time of DITL).5 We perform IP to AS mapping using
Team Cymru [25], removing IP addresses that are private, asso-
ciated with IXPs, or not announced publicly by any ASes. We
merge AS siblings together into one ‚Äòorganization‚Äô. We derive sib-
ling data from CAIDA‚Äôs AS to organization dataset [15]. We group
paths by ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location, except for ‚ÄòAll Roots‚Äô, for which
we group paths by ‚ü®region, AS, root‚ü© location. We assign each
‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location equal weight; when a given ‚ü®region, AS‚ü©
location hosts multiple RIPE Atlas probes that measure different
path lengths to a given destination, the location‚Äôs weight is split
evenly across the measured lengths.
Figure 6a shows shorter paths to Microsoft than to the roots.
(Weighting by traffic volumes yielded similar results.) 69% of all
paths to Microsoft only traverse two ASes (direct from RIPE Atlas
probe AS to destination AS), and only 5% of paths to Microsoft
traverse four or more ASes. Conversely, between 5% and 44% paths
to root letters only traverse two ASes, and between 12% and 63% of
paths to roots traverse four or more ASes.
To demonstrate how short AS paths tend to have lower infla-
tion, Figure 6b shows the correlation between AS path length and
geographic inflation6. We compare to geographic (as opposed to
latency) inflation since we are able to calculate it for more root let-
ters. For the inflation towards destinations in Figure 6b, we use the
geographic inflation associated with that ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location
calculated for Figure 2 and Figure 5a. The AS path length towards
each destination is the most common AS path length measured
across RIPE Atlas probes in the same ‚ü®region, AS‚ü© location. Fig-
ure 6b demonstrates that paths that traverse fewer ASes tend to
be inflated less. All Roots shows that this is true globally, across
root letters, and the results for each individual root letter shows
geographic inflation is less for paths traversing 2 ASes than it is for
paths traversing more (except for B and E root). The relationship
between inflation and AS path length is very different across root
letters, which is evidence of different deployment strategies.
Overall, our results demonstrate that shorter paths tend to have
less inflation, users have shorter paths to Microsoft than towards the
roots, and Microsoft tends to have less inflation across path lengths.
We believe these observations are a result of strategic business
investments that Microsoft puts toward peering and optimizing its
routing and infrastructure. In addition to shorter AS paths generally
being less inflated [70], direct paths to Microsoft‚Äôs CDN in particular
sidestep the challenges of BGP by aligning the best performing
paths with the BGP decision process [20]. Direct paths will usually
be preferred according to BGP‚Äôs top criteria, local preference and
AS path length (because by definition they are the shortest and
from a peer, and ASes usually set local preference to prefer peer
routes in the absence of customer routes, which for Microsoft will
only exist during a route leak/hijack). Among the multiple direct
paths to Microsoft that a router may learn when its AS connects
to Microsoft in different locations, the decision will usually fall
to lowest IGP cost, choosing the nearest egress into Microsoft.
Microsoft collocates anycast sites with all its peering locations, and
so the nearest egress will often (and, in the case of the largest ring,
always) be collocated with the nearest anycast site, aligning early
exit routing with global optimization in a way that is impossible in
the general case or with longer AS paths [70]. At smaller ring sizes,
Microsoft can use traffic engineering (for example, not announcing
to particular ASes at particular peering points) when it observes
an AS making poor routing decisions.
7.2 Larger Deployments are Less Efficient but
Have Lower Latency
CDN latency in Figure 4a and inflation in Figure 5 reveal a rela-
tionship that some may find non-intuitive ‚Äì as deployment size
5We use AS path lengths from traceroutes towards the roots measured in 2018 in
Figure 6, so that we can pair AS path length directly with 2018 DITL inflation data.
