I am currently working on a web2py-based image blog and have encountered some errors that I'm unable to resolve. Here are the details:

### Error Details

**Internal Error:**
- **Ticket Issued:** `images/127.0.0.1.2016-11-22.16-44-39.95144250-6a2e-4648-83f9-aa55873e6ae8`
- **Error Type:** `NameError: name 'myconf' is not defined`

**Version Information:**
- **web2py Version:** 2.14.6-stable+timestamp.2016.05.10.00.21.47
- **Python Version:** 2.7.12

**Traceback:**
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/sonu/Software/web2py/gluon/restricted.py", line 227, in restricted
    exec ccode in environment
  File "/home/sonu/Software/web2py/applications/images/models/menu.py", line 17, in <module>
    response.meta.author = myconf.get('app.author')
NameError: name 'myconf' is not defined
```

### Solution

I was able to resolve this issue by following these steps:

1. **Remove the `menu.py` file:**
   - Navigate to the `models` directory within your application.
   - Delete the `menu.py` file.

After removing the `menu.py` file, the error no longer appeared, and the application functioned as expected.

### Summary

- **Problem:** The `myconf` object was not defined in the `menu.py` file, causing a `NameError`.
- **Solution:** Deleting the `menu.py` file resolved the issue.

If you encounter the same problem, try deleting the `menu.py` file to see if it resolves the error.
