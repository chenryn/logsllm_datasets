Transcribing Transistors
In light of the technical specifications of modern processors, it is interesting to see how
they compare with some of the most important processors in the history of personal
computing.
Intel 4004 1971, 750kHz clock frequency, 2,300 transistors, 4-bit accumulator
architecture, 8 m pMOS, 3x4 mm2, 816 cycles/instruction, designed for a desktop
printing calculator

1981
Motorola 68000 1979, 8MHz clock frequency, 68,000 transistors, 32-bit general-
purpose register architecture (with 24 address pins), heavily microcoded (even
nanocoded), eight address registers, eight data registers, used in the original
Macintosh in 1984
3.2.1. Fundamental Aspects of the G5
All POWER processors listed in Table 32, as well as the G5 derivatives, share some fundamental
architectural features. They are all 64-bit and superscalar, and they perform speculative, out-of-order
execution. Let us briefly discuss each of these terms.
file://C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\Silvia\Lokale Einstellungen\Temp\~hh687B.htm 20.08.2007
Chapter 3. Inside an Apple Page 11 of 83
3.2.1.1. 64-bit Processor
Although there is no formal definition of what constitutes a 64-bit processor, the following attributes
are shared by all 64-bit processors:
64-bit-wide general-purpose registers
Support for 64-bit virtual addressing, although the physical or virtual address spaces may not
use all 64 bits
Integer arithmetic and logical operations performed on all 64 bits of a 64-bit operandwithout
being broken down into, say, two operations on two 32-bit quantities
The PowerPC architecture was designed to support both 32-bit and 64-bit computation modesan
implementation is free to implement only the 32-bit subset. The G5 supports both computation
modes. In fact, the POWER4 supports multiple processor architectures: the 32-bit and 64-bit
POWER; the 32-bit and 64-bit PowerPC; and the 64-bit Amazon architecture. We will use the term
PowerPC to refer to both the processor and the processor architecture. We will discuss the 64-bit
capabilities of the 970FX in Section 3.3.12.1.
Amazon
The Amazon architecture was defined in 1991 by a group of IBM researchers and
developers as they collaborated to create an architecture that could be used for both the
RS/6000 and the AS/400. Amazon is a 64-bit-only architecture.
3.2.1.2. Superscalar
If we define scalar to be a processor design in which one instruction is issued per clock cycle, then a
superscalar processor would be one that issues a variable number of instructions per clock cycle,
allowing a clock-cycle-per-instruction (CPI) ratio of less than 1. It is important to note that even
though a superscalar processor can issue multiple instructions in a clock cycle, it can do so only with
several caveats, such as whether the instructions depend on each other and which specific functional
units they use. Superscalar processors typically have multiple functional units, including multiple
units of the same type.
VLIW
Another type of multiple-issue processor is a very-large instruction-word (VLIW)
processor, which packages multiple operations into one very long instruction. The
compilerrather than the processor's instruction dispatcherplays a critical role in selecting
which instructions are to be issued simultaneously in a VLIW processor. It may schedule
operations by using heuristics, traces, and profiles to guess branch directions.
3.2.1.3. Speculative Execution
A speculative processor can execute instructions before it is determined whether those instructions
will need to be executed (instructions may not need to be executed because of a branch that bypasses
them, for example). Therefore, instruction execution does not wait for control dependencies to
resolveit waits only for the instruction's operands (data) to become available. Such speculation can be
file://C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\Silvia\Lokale Einstellungen\Temp\~hh687B.htm 20.08.2007
Chapter 3. Inside an Apple Page 12 of 83
done by the compiler, the processor, or both. The processors in Table 32 employ in-hardware
dynamic branch prediction (with multiple branches "in flight"), speculation, and dynamic scheduling
of instruction groups to achieve substantial instruction-level parallelism.
3.2.1.4. Out-of-Order Execution
A processor that performs out-of-order execution includes additional hardware that can bypass
instructions whose operands are not availablesay, due to a cache miss that occurred during register
loading. Thus, rather than always executing instructions in the order they appear in the programs
being run, the processor may execute instructions whose operands are ready, deferring the bypassed
instructions for execution at a more appropriate time.
3.2.2. New POWER Generations
The POWER4 contains two processor cores in a single chip. Moreover, the POWER4 architecture has
features that help in virtualization. Examples include a special hypervisor mode in the processor, the
ability to include an address offset when using nonvirtual memory addressing, and support for
multiple global interrupt queues in the interrupt controller. IBM's Logical Partitioning (LPAR) allows
multiple independent operating system images (such as AIX and Linux) to be run on a single
POWER4-based system simultaneously. Dynamic LPAR (DLPAR), introduced in AIX 5L Version
5.2, allows dynamic addition and removal of resources from active partitions.
The POWER4+ improves upon the POWER4 by reducing its size, consuming less power, providing a
larger L2 cache, and allowing more DLPAR partitions.
The POWER5 introduces simultaneous multithreading (SMT), wherein a single processor supports
multiple instruction streamsin this case, twosimultaneously.
Many Processors . . . Simultaneously
IBM's RS 64 IV, a 64-bit member of the PowerPC family, was the first mainstream
processor to support processor-level multithreading (the processor holds the states of
multiple threads). The RS 64 IV implemented coarse-grained two-way multithreadinga
single thread (the foreground thread) executed until a high-latency event, such as a cache
miss, occurred. Thereafter, execution switched to the background thread. This was
essentially a very fast hardware-based context-switching implementation. Additional
hardware resources allowed two threads to have their state in hardware at the same time.
Switching between the two states was extremely fast, consuming only three "dead"
cycles.
The POWER5 implements two-way SMT, which is far more fine-grained. The processor
fetches instructions from two active instruction streams. Each instruction includes a
thread indicator. The processor can issue instructions from both streams simultaneously
to the various functional units. In fact, an instruction pipeline can simultaneously contain
instructions from both streams in its various stages.
A two-way SMT implementation does not provide a factor-of-two performance
improvementthe processor effectively behaves as if it were more than one processor, but
not quite two processors. Nevertheless, the operating system sees a symmetric-
multiprocessing (SMP) programming mode. Typical improvement factors range between
1.2 and 1.3, with a best case of about 1.6. In some pathological cases, the performance
could even degrade.

Chapter 3. Inside an Apple Page 13 of 83
A single POWER5 chip contains two cores, each of which is capable of two-way SMT.
A multichip module (MCM) can contain multiple such chips. For example, a four-chip
POWER5 module has eight cores. When each core is running in SMT mode, the
operating system will see sixteen processors. Note that the operating system will be able
to utilize the "real" processors first before resorting to SMT.
The POWER5 supports other important features such as the following:
64-way multiprocessing.
Subprocessor partitioning (or micropartitioning), wherein multiple LPAR partitions can share a
single processor.[19] Micropartitioned LPARs support automatic CPU load balancing.
[19] A single processor may be shared by up to 10 partitions, with support for up to
160 partitions total.
Virtual Inter-partition Ethernet, which enables a VLAN connection between LPARsat gigabit
or even higher speedswithout requiring physical network interface cards. Virtual Ethernet
devices can be defined through the management console. Multiple virtual adapters are
supported per partition, depending on the operating system.
Virtual I/O Server Partition,[20] which provides virtual disk storage and Ethernet adapter
sharing. Ethernet sharing connects virtual Ethernet to external networks.
[20] The Virtual I/O Server Partition must run in either a dedicated partition or a
micropartition.
An on-chip memory controller.
Dynamic firmware updates.
Detection and correction of errors in transmitting data courtesy of specialized circuitry.
Fast Path, the ability to execute some common software operations directly within the
processor. For example, certain parts of TCP/IP processing that are traditionally handled within
the operating system using a sequence of processor instructions could be performed via a single
instruction. Such silicon acceleration could be applied to other operating system areas such as
message passing and virtual memory.
Besides using 90-nm technology, the POWER5+ adds several features to the POWER5's feature set,
for example: 16GB page sizes, 1TB segments, multiple page sizes per segment, a larger (2048-entry)
translation lookaside buffer (TLB), and a larger number of memory controller read queues.
The POWER6 is expected to add evolutionary improvements and to extend the Fast Path concept
even further, allowing functions of higher-level softwarefor example, databases and application
serversto be performed in silicon.[21] It is likely to be based on a 65-nm process and is expected to
have multiple ultra-high-frequency cores and multiple L2 caches.
[21] The "reduced" in RISC becomes not quite reduced!
3.2.3. The PowerPC 970, 970FX, and 970MP
file://C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\Silvia\Lokale Einstellungen\Temp\~hh687B.htm 20.08.2007
Chapter 3. Inside an Apple Page 14 of 83
The PowerPC 970 was introduced in October 2002 as a 64-bit high-performance processor for
desktops, entry-level servers, and embedded systems. The 970 can be thought of as a stripped-down
POWER4+. Apple used the 970followed by the 970FX and the 970MPin its G5-based systems. Table
33 contains a brief comparison of the specifications of these processors. Figure 33 shows a pictorial
comparison. Note that unlike the POWER4+, whose L2 cache is shared between cores, each core in
the 970MP has its own L2 cache, which is twice as large as the L2 cache in the 970 or the 970FX.

[a] The 970FX and 970MP use 90 nm lithography, in which copper wiring, strained
silicon, and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) are fused into the same manufacturing process.
This technique accelerates electron flow through transistors and provides an insulating
layer in silicon. The result is increased performance, transistor isolation, and lower power
consumption. Controlling power dissipation is particularly critical for chips with low
process geometries, where subthreshold leakage current can cause problems.
[b] The L2 cache is shared between the two processor cores.
[c] Although jointly developed by Motorola, Apple, and IBM, AltiVec is a trademark of
Motorola, or more precisely, Freescale. In early 2004, Motorola spun out its
semiconductor products sector as Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.

[d] PowerTune is a clock-frequency and voltage-scaling technology.
Another noteworthy point about the 970MP is that both its cores share the same input and output
busses. In particular, the output bus is shared "fairly" between cores using a simple round-robin
algorithm.
