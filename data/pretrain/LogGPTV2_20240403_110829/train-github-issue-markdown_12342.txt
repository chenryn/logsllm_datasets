### Problem description
When we display a list of MenuItems, hovering the mouse results in whatever
the mouse landing on being highlighted. From that state, keyboard controls
(assuming the list is receiving them) change what is selected, and therefore
the highlighting, but the hover highlight does not go away. Moving the mouse
between menu items replaces both highlightings.
### Steps to reproduce
create a paper element  
create a series of menuitem elements inside the paper element  
hover mouse over a menu item  
press the down arrow
