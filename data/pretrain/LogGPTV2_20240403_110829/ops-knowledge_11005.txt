Question: "A user, after initially enrolling a PIN with Gatekeeper, desires to change their credential. Considering the Android authentication system, which of the following statements correctly describe the impact of various actions taken during the credential change process?"
 "A": "If the user provides their existing credential successfully, a new user SID is generated and cryptographically bound to the new credential."
 "B": "Without presenting the existing credential, the new credential will inherit the old user SID, but access to keys under the old SID will still be permanently lost."
 "C": "If the existing credential is verified successfully, the user SID associated with the existing credential is transferred to the new credential."
 "D": "In case of an untrusted enroll, the new credential receives a newly generated user SID, and keys associated with the old SID become permanently inaccessible to the user."
Answer: CD
