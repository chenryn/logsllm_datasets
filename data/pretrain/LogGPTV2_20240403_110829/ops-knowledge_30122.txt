User: I created a virtualenv around my project, but when I try to activate it I cannot.
It might just be syntax or folder location, but I am stumped right now.
You can see below, I create the virtualenv and call it venv. Everything looks good, then I try to activate it by running source venv/bin/activate
I'm thinking it might just have to do with my system path, but not sure what to point it to (I do know how to edit the path). I'm on python 7 / windows os, virtual env 2.2.x

Assistant: For activation you can go to the venv your virtualenv directory
by cd venv.
Then on Windows, type dir (on unix, type ls). 
You will get 5 folders include, Lib, Scripts, tcl and 60 
Now type .\Scripts\activate to activate your virtualenv venv.

Your prompt will change to indicate that you are now operating within the virtual environment. It will look something like this (venv)user@host:~/venv$.
And your venv is activated now.
