I have created a virtual environment for my project, but I am unable to activate it. The issue might be related to the syntax or the folder location, but I'm not sure. Below is the process I followed:

1. I created the virtual environment and named it `venv`. Everything seemed to work fine.
2. I tried to activate it by running `source venv/bin/activate`.

However, I received the following error:
```
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

I suspect this might be related to my system path, but I'm not sure what to point it to (I do know how to edit the path). I am using Python 7 on Windows with virtualenv version 2.2.x.

Here is the output of the commands I ran:

```sh

The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated; it is now the default behavior.

### Solution

On Windows, the `source` command is not recognized because it is specific to Unix-based systems. Instead, you should use the appropriate activation script for Windows. Here are the steps to activate your virtual environment:

1. Navigate to the `venv` directory where your virtual environment is located:
   ```sh
   cd c:\testdjangoproj\mysite\venv\Scripts
   ```

2. Run the activation script:
   ```sh
   activate
   ```

Alternatively, you can activate the virtual environment from any directory by specifying the full path to the `activate` script:
```sh
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite\venv\Scripts\activate
```

After running the activation script, your command prompt should change to indicate that you are now operating within the virtual environment. It will look something like this:
```sh
(venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>
```

This indicates that your virtual environment is now activated.
