A man-in-the-middle IMSI Catcher has to forward the traﬃc to the network. An
easy way, is to tap into the cipher negotiation sequence and change the set of
supported ciphers. The easiest choice for attackers is A5/0 (no encryption) and
A5/2 (the weakened export-variant of A5/1), as described in Sect. 3.3. However,
many networks (incl. T-Mobile Austria) banned these ciphers for years.
Instead, they started to support the A5/3 cipher [2]. On GSM this is the only
cipher without (publicly) available rainbow tables or other decryption methods.
4 Technically, this is an Location Update Request with Origin LAC set to the current
LAC and an optional GRPS header with the Attach-Bit set.

the real network. During fall-back into the real network, the captures phone gives away
the LAC of the IMSI Catcher.
However, many MS still do not support this mode. On our network, in
September 2015, 29 % used A5/1 and 71 % A5/3 (Fig. 4, n = 7402). Other cipher
modes where prohibited in this network.
An operator-run database of {IMEI, highest-used-cipher}-tuples provides the
basis to detect cipher downgrades. This database is updated on ﬁrst contact with
the network and whenever a device uses a higher ranked5 encryption than the

one stored. As long as there is no SS7/Diameter standard on exchanging this
form of information, every operator has to run their own database (or include it
into the HLR/HSS). Once the highest available cipher of a device is established,
the network should not accept a lower one, or at least generate a warning. Thus,
making a downgrade attack visible to the operator except when the user is
attacked on the very ﬁrst contact with a new network. Except for a ﬁrmware
bug, there is no reason why a device should stop supporting higher cipher levels.
6.2 Detection of Relayed Traﬃc
The most compatible and least interfering way for a capturing IMSI Catcher to
operate is to relay all traﬃc. If it is encrypted with A5/1 or A5/2 the decryption
can be done separately, otherwise it has to be downgraded. Based on enough
traces, the session key Kc can be reconstructed [27,29]. In conjunction with
another vulnerabilities (e.g., weak COMP128), also the secret authentication
key Ki can be read and the SIM card cloned [12]. Once Kc is known, this allows
an IMSI Catcher to decrypt A5/3 as well, since the Kc is used for all ciphers.
For SIM cards with only a 64 bit key, the Kc is doubled K = {Kc||Kc} to 128
bit and therefore allows decryption of UMTS as well6.
We tested if the analysis of the round-trip times can be a good measure
to uncover traﬃc relay. Therefore, we analyzed authorization round trips in the
wild of 4165 random transactions within one minute, nationwide. The histogram
in Fig. 7 shows a high deviation (¯x = 0.586 sec, δ = 0.334) of response times

Request and Authentication Response on a real network.

with a notable retransmission interval of about 0.25 s. We estimate that a well-
designed traﬃc-forwarding IMSI catcher could relay the traﬃc in 100 ms or less,
thus being far from statistically signiﬁcant in single instances.
Further analysis presented vast diﬀerences between manufacturers as well as
handset types. Based on the Type Allocation Code (TAC)7 we run independent
nationwide collections. Figure 8 shows 12 diverse popular handset types and
highlights three diﬀerent iPhones to illustrate their diﬀerent behavior (based
on an average of 3,400 transactions per phone type). Since this values have a
much smaller standard deviation (e.g., σGalaxyS4 = 0.198, σIPhone3gs = 0.200,
σIPhone4s = 0.206), they are a better basis to detect relay delays (i.e. average
authorization round trip time increases on multiple occasions for a single user).
Additionally, a provider side detection can correlate such changes geographically
(i.e. average authorization round trip time increases in a geographical area).

models. Three Apple phones highlighted to show the distinct diﬀerences in their autho-
rization response time. (n ≈ 3400 for each phone type)
6.3 Detection of Unknown, Unusual or Implausible Origin-LAI/TAI
in Location Update Requests
Eventually, every IMSI Catcher victim falls back into the genuine network (Fig. 6).
During this step, the LAC of the attacker is leaked back into the real network8. As
stated above, it is favorable for an attacker to choose an unused LAC as this forces
7 TAC are the ﬁrst 8 digits of an IMEI that encode the manufacturer and phone
model. Popular models might end up with multiple assigned TACs. This is somewhat
similar to the assigned OUI preﬁx in Ethernet MAC addresses: they encode the
manufacturer.

every victim to actively contact the fake base station on entrance and therefore
inform the attacker about its capture. This LAC is either completely unknown in
the genuine network or far away.
We investigated the possibility of creating shadow instances that follow every
location area update and reject implausible location changes. While the cur-
rent monitoring infrastructure does not allow to monitor all location updates
nationwide for all mobile phones (Sect. 7.3), we scaled down and implemented
a prototype that is able to follow individual UE/MS through diﬀerent access
technologies based on PCAP ﬁles from the core network. The two main inves-
tigated properties are (i) the correctness and completeness of location update
trails and (ii) the geographical plausibility of location updates (i.e. only adjacent
locations).
The correctness and completeness of location update trails means that loca-
tion trails form an uninterrupted chain. A gap would be a strong hint for a visited
LAC to not be under the control of the operator. The geographical plausibility
checks if updates only occur between geographically neighboring locations. This
neighbor property does not have to be derived geographically, but can be estab-
lished statistically (i.e. recording frequent location updates between Location
Areas). Unless operators agreed on national roaming, the phone stays on the
home network, so no operator collaboration is necessary.
In the following evaluation we discovered a number of corner cases that com-
plicate the interpretation of the results.
Power on at a New Location. UE/MS not always correctly detach from
a network when turned oﬀ (e.g. battery loss, temporary reception loss during
power oﬀ). At the next power on, the UE/MS will use the previous LAC as
origin for a location update. Imagine this plausible case as depicted in Fig. 9: A
ﬂight passenger turns oﬀ the phone at takeoﬀ in one city, but the IMSI deattach
message was not produced or did not arrive at the network. After landing, the
passenger turns the phone back on during the train ride from the airport to the
city. In most cases, the phone will send a location update to the network as if it
just passed the border between the two location areas. This even happens after
intercontinental ﬂights. Airport cells could be whitelisted to some extent, but
they will not catch all cases (such as in the example above).
Because such (tunneled) location update are indistinguishable from a direct
location changes, they are not immediately a red ﬂag.
Additionally, road and railway tunnels also oﬀer geographical shortcuts, but
– unlike plane routes – the ends of the tunnel only connect two points and will be
statistically assigned as neighbors, since a large number of passengers traverse
without turning oﬀ their phones.
Old Baseband State Restoration. Phones regularly and at certain events save
parts of the baseband state information to non-volatile memory. For faster boot

times, the phone can facilitate this information (e.g. already knows the frequency
range of the preferred operator and does not has to scan the whole frequency range).
This includes the last known LAC.
One of our test phones had a defective power button which lead to random
reboots. In the traces we discovered that the phone sometimes used obsolete
LAC information as origin (i.e. reused a LAC as origin a second time, because
another location change was not recorded properly before reboot).
6.4 Detection of a Access Technology Downgrade
As described in Sect. 3.4 and Fig. 1, access technology downgrades are easy
to perform and included in todays commercially available IMSI Catchers [22].
A phone camping on 2G even though 3G or 4G should be available in the area
is not a strong indicator. In some cases, structural properties can lead to bet-
ter reception of certain frequency ranges (e.g., 2G on lower frequencies is usu-
ally better receivable underground). On the other hand, a MS/UE can be set
intentionally to use 2G only for power conservation. A provider could install an
application on the SIM to monitor the access technology and location updates;
however, this is out of scope for this paper.
7 Discussion
We identiﬁed strong and weak indicators based on the statistics of certain fea-
tures in real-world data. Strong indicators have low potential for false positives.
A per device (IMEI) database of the highest-used cipher can reliably
detect cipher downgrades or deactivation of ciphering. Additionally, we have
shown that mobile phones leak the (fake) LAC of the capturing IMSI
Catcher to the real network. This case can trivially be detected based the on
analysis of Location Update Requests. If the attacker misuses a genuine LAC, it
can still be detected by a consistence check of the Location Update trail.
Based on certain corner cases, the latter has the potential for false positives

(LUR tunnel eﬀect, restoration of old baseband states) and therefore needs to be
backed up by additional geographical, temporal and subscriber based correlation.
Another method is the transmission delay introduced by an MITM
attack. We tested this technique based on the authorization round trip times.
In general, the deviation is quite large, but can be narrowed if the device type
is considered as well. Every device has a very speciﬁc distribution of round
trip times. However, for a statistically signiﬁcant result (e.g. for a device under
attack), multiple measurements have to be collected.
From the provider point of view, the hardest attack to detect is that of
a tracking-only IMSI Catcher. Except for a few very old phones, this partic-
ular attack does not produce any messages in the core network. It has still
to be explored if certain frequency-monitoring functions on BTS, NodeBs, and
eNodeBs can be repurposed to detect such rouge base stations.
7.1 Ethical Considerations
As described in the research set up (Sect. 4) we have used real data only under
very strict conditions to comply with ethical and legislative requirements. We
have only worked on signaling data and never had access to user data or personal
subscriber information.
7.2 Comparison with Client Detection Methods
Operator detection of IMSI Catchers does not supersede client detection
(c.f. Sect. 8.1). It complements it and gives the operator the opportunity to
monitor such attacks in its network regardless of precautions by individual sub-
scribers. However, since the detection schemes can only ﬁnd phones that are
either under the control of an attacker - or just switched back to the genuine
network - the operator can only warn the user in question post-attack.
On the other hand, client based techniques give the user the ability to detect
a current attack against his/her very device. On tracking IMSI Catchers this
technique provides better detection rates.
7.3 Limitations
The current implementation of our detection methods is based on the old some-
what limited monitoring system deployed in the network. It can ﬁlter some pre-
extracted of each packet and transaction against a query containing a limited
set of operators and literal values (i.e. ﬁlter by a speciﬁc cell, IMSI, IMEI, pro-
tocol type, etc.). It can not compare between cells or apply more complex ﬁlters.
Additionally, the return buﬀer size is limited to 10 K–30 K results, depending
on the search mode. This limits our current implementations to single users
(or single cells) at a time. This is the reason we could not run a nation wide
search so far.

7.4 Future Work
Our results show that detection from the operator side is possible and tested its
usefulness within the limitations of the current monitoring system. We suggest
that parameters such as ciphering and origin LAC in Location Area Updates
should be extracted directly at the probes and made available. This pre-selection
step will eliminate current limitations. For example, it will allow to search for
inconsistencies in used ciphers, based on the IMEI (or TAC). Additionally, a new
monitoring system based on Apache Hadoop is currently in development that is
expected to remove most limitations of the current system.
With the large number of dummy LACs used by phones, one can wonder if
an attacker could use dummy LACs such as 0xFFFE for masking their existence.
Another way, to mask the fake LAC of an IMSI Catcher is, to announce a neigh-
bor frequency occupied by a second IMSI Catcher with a reasonable LAC. While
doubling the hardware costs for an attacker, this might whitewash the Origin
LAC ﬁeld used in Sect. 6.3. Both ideas need further testing with end devices
to conﬁrm or deny their practical feasibility. As discussed before (Sect. 6.4), a
SIM card application can monitor and report certain network parameters back
to the network (e.g., keep a local copy of a CellID/LAC trail) and detect both
cases. However, over time, many diﬀerent cards from diﬀerent vendors have been
acquired so developing and maintaining such an application poses a ﬁnancial
burden and an operational risk.
Furthermore, we plan to reﬁne the timing models used in Sect. 6.2 to become
more accurate and create better models for timing delays introduced by traﬃc
relaying.
