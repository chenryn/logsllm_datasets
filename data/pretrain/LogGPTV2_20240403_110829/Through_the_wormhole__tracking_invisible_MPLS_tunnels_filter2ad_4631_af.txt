# MPLS Deployment and Path Length Analysis

## Table 5: MPLS Deployment per AS
The percentages for TTL signatures are rounded, and the total may exceed 100%. "DPR or BRPR" refers to hops revealed by either DPR or BRPR (when only one IP address is discovered in a tunnel, there is no difference between the two methods). "Others" refers to a mix of discovery techniques (a tunnel might be, in some cases, revealed by DPR and, in another trace, by BRPR).

| AS | TTL Signature (%) | DPR or BRPR (%) | Others (%) |
|----|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| 67 | 2                 | 17               | 2          |
| 77 | 1                 | 1                | 4          |

| 24 | 0                 | 0                | 4          |

## Figure 11: Effects of Invisible MPLS Tunnels on Path Length Distribution
### Path Length Distribution for All ASes

- **Invisible Tunnels**: Blue dashed line
- **Visible Tunnels**: Black solid line

This figure shows the effects of invisible MPLS tunnels on path length distribution. The blue dashed line represents the distribution with invisible tunnels, while the black solid line represents the distribution when hidden routers are revealed.

### Key Observations
- **AS3320 (Deutsche Telekom)**: The peak at 23 is caused by invisible tunnels.
- **AS3549 (Level3)**: Another significant peak (not shown due to space limitations).

For AS3320, we identified a full-mesh structure made of 23 routers. This structure can be generalized into a more standard graph, as confirmed by the graph density analysis in Table 4. The density is reduced by a factor of ten once invisible tunnels are revealed.

### Path Length Metrics
- **Path Length**: The number of hops between two devices in the network.
- **Shortest Path**: The path offering the minimum distance between a given pair of nodes.
- **Average Path Length**: The average length of shortest paths for all pairs of networking devices.
- **Graph Diameter**: The longest shortest path.

### Impact of Invisible Tunnels
- **Mean Path Length**: 10 with invisible tunnels, 12 when hidden routers are revealed.
- **Underestimation**: Our current techniques only reveal the last tunnel in a trace, leading to an underestimation of the actual path length shift.

### Conclusion
The results presented here illustrate the effect of invisible tunnels on basic graph characteristics. More extensive measurement campaigns and analyses are required to fully understand the impact on the entire Internet.

## Techniques for Revealing Hidden IP Hops
- **FRPLA and RTLA**: Provide the length distribution of invisible tunnels.
- **DPR and BRPR**: Reveal the IP hops hidden by invisible tunnels.
- **FRPLA**: Scalable and works with any IP level dataset.
- **RTLA**: Requires an additional echo-request per IP address but provides more accurate estimations for Juniper routers.

These techniques are sufficient to determine whether an AS hides an invisible MPLS cloud and to evaluate the stretch in terms of Internet path length caused by these tunnels.
