ﬁdence intervals from those. We obtain conﬁdence intervals
of 8.72±0.38, 9.10±0.65, and 10.90±0.45 for G0.1, G0.2, and
G0.5, respectively (for a conﬁdence level of 90%). This indi-
cates that the diﬀerences for circle and random are indeed
signiﬁcant even for 50 samples only.
However, this analysis is somewhat problematic, as the
sampled subsets are (almost certainly) not disjoint (as 114
samples is not suﬃcient). But we still believe that it is
indicative for the signiﬁcance of the results, in particular
because the above intervals were obtained from 50 samples
only, and the larger number of samples should give even
smaller intervals.
5.5 Usability Considerations
The main goal of our study was to measure the security of
the Android Unlock Pattern scheme, as already pointed out
in Section 3.2. Furthermore, we introduced small changes
in the graphical layout of the scheme to learn about the ra-
tionals behind actual user choices for Android Unlock Pat-
terns. Hence, the overall design of the study did not take
usability into its main focus, but we have collected some
data that allows us to argue about the usability of the re-
sulting scheme. First, we recorded the number of attempts
people needed to (correctly) enter their passwords. Second,
we know how many attempts people needed to enter their
password (or fail to do so) after the 20-minute-period. Both
give us some indication on the memorability and usability of
the scheme. Table 3 compares the usability of all approaches
by this metric. The plain Android Unlock Pattern performs
slightly better in relation to the Leftout Large, Circle and
Random approaches. Only for Leftout Small, participants
needed less attempts to recall the pattern on average.
A possible explanation is that many participants have al-
ready used Android Unlock Patterns before. This is sup-
ported by (informal) inquiries during our study. Conse-
quently, they found it easier to choose (and remember) a
password in this arrangement of nodes. This is in line with

the fact that Leftout Small performed better than all other
approaches as has the biggest similarity to the plain ap-
proach. In addition, it has the smallest number of nodes.
Consequently, the other approaches performed slightly worse
as the arrangement of the points was new to the participants.
This is particularly true for Random. As expected, it per-
formed worst: only 62% of participants could recall their
secret within ﬁve attempts.
Concluding, our new arrangements are not superior to the
plain Android Pattern Login regarding usability. However,
we think that this is based in the novelty of the approaches
and cannot be seen as shortcoming.
It is out of scope of
this article to investigate deeper if the usability could be
improved, for example by giving the users suﬃcient training
on recalling patterns on the new arrangements.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst large-scale
user study of Android Unlock Patterns. In particular, we
have focused on the actual entropy, in contrast to theoretical
values such as the size of the key space, that do not provide
a reasonable estimate for the strength. Interestingly, around
10% of all users use less than 190 patterns while less than
300 patterns capture around 50% of the whole test poplu-
ation (7.56 and 8.19 bit entropy, respectively for oﬀensive
patterns, cf. Table 2). Our ﬁndings are based on a study
with a total of 584 participants. All in all, recruiting these
584 people was rather time consuming and the clear bottle-
neck of this approach. The dataset is large enough to create
Markov models of transitions between points in the 3 × 3
grid (Android Unlock Patterns) and derive a very eﬃcient
attack, yielding a good approximation the exact strength,
cf. Table 2 for a detailed comparison of the results for diﬀer-
ent unlock patterns. However, as explained in Section 3.2,
they are most likely upper bounds on the strength we expect
to see in real world systems.
To deepen these insights, we tested four simple modiﬁca-
tions of Android Unlock Patterns. Interestingly, Circle was
both a very simple but also a rather secure modiﬁcation—
pointing towards the fact that people like to follow lines
(plain Android Unlock Patterns, but also Leftout Small and
Large: As soon as we removed these lines, the overall en-
tropy increased. Apparently, the Random pattern was too
diﬃcult for users to recognize so they were not able to choose
good passwords on the short term. Probably this picture
were to change if they were given more time to familiarize
themselves with this speciﬁc pattern. However, this is out
of scope for this article.
We believe some of the ideas presented in our work are
worth exploring further. First, it might be possible to choose
other patterns (that we did not test) that might oﬀer even
better security, at the same level of usability. Our work in-
dicates a couple of potential directions. Clearly, we need to
put a strong emphasis on usability here. Second, the system
could provide some form of visual feedback to the user about
the strength of the pattern he is about to choose: (red: weak
password, green: strong password). While this certainly has
the potential to increase the security of the patterns, this
must be done more accurately than the prevalent “password
rules” that are frequently used for text-based passwords, and
it poses questions about usability. Third, we could prevent
the attacker from building an attack dictionary (as we did)
by having diﬀerent (challenge) patterns for diﬀerent smart-
phones/users.
