User: I have a VPS with system-wide installed python 2.5. 
I installed python 2.7 to one of the user's home dir (using --prefix). added it to bashrc and bash_profile, exported python variable to env, and now when I type python in console python 2.7 is running.
But when I checked python version from my application (Django using with FastCGI) I still see that it is using 2.5. 
In ps output I see python processes running for this account and apache processes runing with hosting-specific account. How can I switch this particular account to 2.7 without changing system-wide version?
Thanks!
Assistant: I had a call to python interpreter via env program in my fast cgi dispatch script. When I explicitly put path to 2.7 to the first line of the script it works as expected.
