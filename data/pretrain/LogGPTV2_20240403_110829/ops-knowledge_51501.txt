Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have a VPS with Python 2.5 installed system-wide. I also installed Python 2.7 in a user's home directory using the `--prefix` option. I updated the `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` files to include the new Python 2.7 installation, and I added the Python 2.7 path to the environment variables. Now, when I type `python` in the console, Python 2.7 runs as expected.

However, when I check the Python version from my Django application (which is running with FastCGI), it still shows that Python 2.5 is being used. The `ps` command output shows Python processes running under the specific user account, while Apache processes are running under a hosting-specific account.

How can I switch this particular user account to use Python 2.7 without changing the system-wide Python version?

Thank you!

**Update:**
I had a call to the Python interpreter via the `env` program in my FastCGI dispatch script. When I explicitly specified the full path to Python 2.7 in the first line of the script, it worked as expected.
