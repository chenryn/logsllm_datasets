**Issue with Method Reordering in Julia**

From: [julia-users](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/julia-users/IsRlOLGeEs8/RRwrs3u2AQAJ)

**Shortened Version:**

```julia
julia> @which pi * pi
*(x::Irrational, y::Irrational) at irrationals.jl:88

julia> module Erratic2
           typealias DummyUnion Union{Irrational, AbstractFloat}
           abstract type DummyReal
           pi * pi
       end
```

**Error Output:**

```plaintext
ErrorException: * not defined for Irrational{:π}

Stacktrace (most recent call last):
  [1] *(::Irrational{:π}, ::Irrational{:π}) at promotion.jl:256
```

**After the Error:**

```julia
julia> @which pi * pi
*{T<:Number}(x::T, y::T) at promotion.jl:256
```

This issue arises due to a reordering of "old" methods. Specifically, the method at `promotion.jl:256` now appears before the method at `irrationals.jl:88`. 

For reference, see the highlighted changes in the following image:
