User: I am trying to execute a python file located in some folder named : folder1
for this I am using :
~$ python /folder1/a.py (doesn't work)
When i go to that folder and then execute everything works fine:
~/folder1$ python a.py   (works)
I think I am using a file write operation in code written in file a.py because of which first way of execution is not working.
Please give some suggestions to fix this.
Assistant: The File was always going to home folder..
I grabbed the absolute path and it worked perfectly for me..
and thanks to Paulo's hint about permissions of file.
