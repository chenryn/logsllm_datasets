### 5.5.4 Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Subscription

Table filters must be defined in a set of available table filters in the publication before they can be enabled on a subscription. For more information on defining table filters, see Section 5.2.3.

**Steps to Enable or Disable Table Filters on an Existing Subscription:**

1. **Ensure Servers are Running and Registered:**
   - Ensure that the publication server and the subscription server are running and registered in the xDB Replication Console.
   - See Sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1 for instructions on starting and registering the servers.

2. **Select the Subscription Node:**
   - Select the Subscription node of the subscription you wish to modify.
   - **Figure 5-45: Selecting a Subscription to Modify Filter Rules**

3. **Open the Filter Rules Tab:**

7. **Perform Snapshot Replication (Recommended):**
   - It is strongly recommended to perform a snapshot replication to ensure the content of the subscription tables is consistent with the updated filtering criteria.
   - See Section 5.4.1 for information on performing a snapshot replication.

### 5.5.5 Removing a Subscription

After removing a subscription, replication can no longer occur for the associated publication until a new subscription is created. Removing a subscription does not delete the subscription tables in the database; it only removes their association with the xDB Replication Server.

**Steps to Remove a Subscription:**

1. **Ensure the Subscription Server is Running and Registered:**
   - Ensure that the subscription server is running and registered in the xDB Replication Console.
   - See Section 5.3.1 for instructions on starting and registering the server.

2. **Select the Subscription Node:**
   - Select the Subscription node of the subscription you wish to remove.
   - **Figure 5-50: Selecting a Subscription to Remove**

3. **Remove the Subscription:**
   - Remove the subscription by either:
     - Choosing "Remove Subscription" from the Subscription menu.
     - Right-clicking on the Subscription node and selecting "Remove Subscription."
     - Clicking the "Remove Subscription" icon.
   - **Figure 5-51: Removing the Subscription Using the Toolbar**

4. **Confirm Removal:**
   - In the "Remove Subscription" confirmation box, click "Yes."
   - **Figure 5-52: Remove Subscription Confirmation**
   - The Subscription node will no longer appear under the Subscription Database node.
   - **Figure 5-53: Replication Tree After Removing a Subscription**

### 5.5.6 Removing a Subscription Database

Deleting a subscription database definition from xDB Replication Server removes its identity and association but does not delete the physical database. Before removing a Subscription Database node, all subscriptions under it must be removed.

**Steps to Remove a Subscription Database:**

1. **Ensure the Subscription Server is Running and Registered:**
   - Ensure that the subscription server is running and registered in the xDB Replication Console.
   - See Section 5.3.1 for instructions on starting and registering the server.

2. **Select the Subscription Database Node:**
   - Select the Subscription Database node you wish to remove.
   - **Figure 5-54: Selecting a Subscription Database for Removal**

3. **Remove the Subscription Database:**
   - From the Subscription menu, choose "Subscription Database" and then "Remove Database."
   - Alternatively, right-click on the Subscription Database node and select "Remove Subscription."
   - The "Remove Subscription Database" confirmation box will appear.

4. **Confirm Removal:**
   - In the "Remove Subscription Database" confirmation box, click "Yes."
   - **Figure 5-55: Remove Subscription Database Confirmation**
   - The Subscription Database node will no longer appear under the Subscription Server node.

### 5.6 Performing Controlled Switchover

Controlled switchover involves exchanging roles between a publication database and a subscription database. This is useful for scenarios where the publication database needs to be taken offline, such as for maintenance. After the switchover, applications connect to the former subscription database, while the former publication database remains synchronized by replication.

**Overview:**

- **Controlled Switchover Tasks:**
  - Copy the control schema objects from the publication database to the subscription database.
  - Copy the control schema objects from the subscription database to the publication database.
  - Update control schema tables to exchange connection information.
  - Modify the xDB Replication Configuration file to reference the new controller database if the former publication database was the designated controller.

**Steps to Perform a Controlled Switchover:**

1. **Stop Transaction Processing:**
   - Stop all transaction processing against the publication database.

2. **Synchronize Databases:**
   - Perform an on-demand synchronization replication or a snapshot replication to replicate any pending updates in the publication database shadow tables to the subscription database.

3. **Stop the Publication and Subscription Servers:**
   - Stop both the publication server and the subscription server.

4. **Review Prerequisites:**
   - Review the prerequisites in Section 5.1 to ensure the subscription database and its host can act as a publication database, and vice versa.

5. **Backup and Delete Schemas:**
   - Create a backup of the required schemas and triggers from the publication and subscription databases.
   - Delete these schemas and triggers after the backup.

6. **Restore Backups:**
   - Restore the backups to the appropriate databases.

7. **Update Control Schema Objects:**
   - Update the control schema objects to reference the new publication and subscription databases.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_pub_database SET db_host = '192.168.2.20';
     UPDATE _edb_replicator_sub.xdb_sub_database SET db_host = '192.168.2.19';
     ```

8. **Update Metadata (if using a new host):**
   - If using a new host, update the subscription and publication metadata to the new locations.

9. **Edit the xDB Replication Configuration File:**
   - Edit the xDB Replication Configuration file to include the new controller database connection and authentication information.
   - **Example:**
     ```ini
     #xDB Replication Server Configuration Properties
     #Fri Jan 30 17:34:06 GMT-05:00 2015
     port=5444
     admin_password=ygJ9AxoJEX854elcVIJPTw\=\=
     user=enterprisedb
     admin_user=enterprisedb
     type=enterprisedb
     database=edb
     password=ygJ9AxoJEX854elcVIJPTw\=\=
     host=192.168.2.20
     ```

10. **Update pg_hba.conf Files:**
    - Update the `pg_hba.conf` files to allow access to the new publication and subscription databases.

11. **Create Replication Slot (if using log-based method):**
    - For the log-based method, create a replication slot on the new publication database server.
    - **Example:**
      ```sql
      SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('xdb_47919_5', 'test_decoding');
      ```

12. **Start the Publication and Subscription Servers:**
    - Start the publication and subscription servers.

13. **Perform a Snapshot Replication:**
    - Confirm that the publication tables are consistent with the subscription tables and perform a snapshot replication.

This completes the controlled switchover process.
