User: I'm running Ubuntu to compile a set of code which requires python 2.4.
How can I setup a terminal launcher so that when I open that launcher all python related commands will use python 2.4 instead of the python 2.6 that is defaulted in Ubuntu?
Assistant: Invoke the interpreter via python2.4 instead of using the default.
