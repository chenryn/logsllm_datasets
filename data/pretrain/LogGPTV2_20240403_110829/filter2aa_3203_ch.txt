The IP multicast address can be hard-coded by the application or obtained through a mechanism 
that allocates a unique multicast address. 
Place the IP multicast packet on the medium.  
The sending host must construct an IP packet containing the destination IP multicast address and 
place it on the medium. In the case of shared access technologies such as Ethernet and Token 
Ring, the destination media access control (MAC) address is derived from the IP multicast address. 
For a host to receive IP multicast packets, it must do the following: 
Inform IP to receive multicast traffic.  
To determine the IP multicast address to use, the application must first determine whether to create 
a new host group or join an existing host group. To join an existing group, the application can use a 
hard-coded multicast address or an address derived from a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) string. 
After the group address is determined, an application must inform IP to receive multicast traffic sent 
to the group address. For example, the application can use Windows Sockets functions to notify IP 
of the multicast groups joined. If multiple applications are using the same IP multicast address, IP 
must pass a copy of the multicast packet to each application. IP must track which applications are 
using which multicast addresses as applications join or leave a host group. For a multihomed host, 
IP must track the application membership of host groups for each subnet. 
Register the multicast MAC address with the network adapter.  
If the network technology supports hardware-based multicasting, then the network adapter is 
informed to pass up packets for a specific multicast address. The host uses the Windows 
NdisRequest() function to inform the network adapter to respond to a multicast MAC address 
corresponding to a IP multicast address. 
Inform local routers.  
The host must inform local subnet routers that it is listening for multicast traffic at a specific group 
address using IGMP or MLD. 
Router Support for IP Multicast 
To forward IP multicast packets to only those subnets for which there are group members, an IP 
multicast router must be able to: 
Receive all IP multicast traffic. 
For shared access technologies, the normal listening mode for network adapters is unicast listening 
mode. The listening mode is the way that the network adapter analyzes the destination MAC 
address of incoming frames to decide to process them further. In unicast listening mode, the only 
frames that are considered for further processing are in a table of interesting destination MAC 
addresses stored on the network adapter. Typically, the only interesting addresses are the 
broadcast address (0xFF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) and the unicast MAC address of the adapter. 
Appendix A – IP Multicast 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 488 
However, for an IP multicast router to receive all IP multicast traffic, it must place the network 
adapter in a special listening mode called multicast promiscuous mode. Multicast promiscuous 
mode analyzes the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)-defined Individual/Group 
(I/G) bit to determine whether the frame requires further processing. The I/G bit for Ethernet 
addresses is the low-order bit of the first byte of the destination MAC address. 
The values of the I/G bit are the following: 
If set to 0, then the address is a unicast (or individual) address.  
If set to 1, then the address is a multicast (or group) address. The multicast bit is also set to 1 for 
the broadcast address.  
When the network adapter is placed in multicast promiscuous listening mode, any frames with the 
I/G bit set to 1 are passed up for further processing. 
Multicast promiscuous mode is different than promiscuous mode. In promiscuous mode, all 
frames—regardless of the destination MAC address—are passed up for processing. Protocol 
analyzers, such as Network Monitor 3.1, use promiscuous mode. Network adapters of hosts are 
typically not placed in multicast promiscuous mode. 
Forward IP multicast traffic. 
IP multicast packet forwarding is a capability of IP. When IP multicast forwarding is enabled, IP 
analyzes IP multicast data packets to determine the interfaces over which the packet is to be 
forwarded. IP performs this analysis by comparing the IP source and destination group addresses 
to entries in the IP multicast forwarding table. Upon receipt of a non-local IP multicast packet, the 
Time to Live (TTL) in the IPv4 header or the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header is decremented by 1. 
If the TTL or hop limit is greater than 0 after decrementing, the multicast forwarding table is 
checked. If an entry in the multicast forwarding table is found that matches the destination IP 
multicast address, the IP multicast packet is forwarded with its new TTL or hop limit over the 
appropriate interfaces. 
The multicast forwarding process does not distinguish between hosts on locally attached subnets 
that are receiving multicast traffic or hosts on a network segment that are downstream from the 
locally attached subnet across another router on the subnet. In other words, a multicast router 
might forward a multicast packet on a subnet for which there are no hosts listening. The multicast 
router forwards the packet because another router on that subnet indicated that a host in its 
direction is receiving the multicast traffic. 
The multicast forwarding table does not record each host group member or the number of host 
group members, only that the multicast traffic needs to be forwarded over specific interfaces. 
Receive and process multicast group membership messages sent by hosts. 
Multicast routers receive IGMP or MLD messages from hosts on all locally attached subnets. This 
information is used to track host group membership by placing or removing entries in the multicast 
forwarding table. Because all multicast routers are listening in multicast promiscuous mode, they 
receive all IGMP and MLD messages sent to any group address. 
To improve the leave latency, which is the time between when the last host on a subnet has left the 
group and when no more multicast traffic for that group is forwarded to that subnet, a host that 
might be the last member of a group on a subnet sends an IGMP Leave Group or MLD Multicast 
Appendix A – IP Multicast 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 489 
Listener Done message. After sending multicast-address-specific IGMP or MLD queries to the 
group being left and receiving no response, the router determines that there are no more group 
members on that subnet. 
Query attached subnets for host membership status. 
Multicast routers periodically send general IGMP and MLD query messages to the local subnet to 
query for host membership information. A host that is still a member of a multicast group responds 
to the query. 
Communicate group membership to other IP multicast routers. 
To create multicast-enabled IP networks containing more than one router, multicast routers must 
communicate group membership information to each other so that group members can receive IP 
multicast traffic regardless of their location on the IP network. 
Multicast routers exchange host membership information using a multicast routing protocol such as 
Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP), Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF), 
or Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM). Group membership is either communicated explicitly, by 
exchanging group address and subnet information, or implicitly, by informing upstream routers 
whether or not group members exist downstream from the source of the multicast traffic. 
The goals of a multicast routing protocol include the following: 
Forward traffic away from the source to prevent loops.  
Minimize or eliminate multicast traffic to subnets that do not need the traffic.  
Minimize processor and memory load on the router for scalability.  
Minimize the overhead of the routing protocol.  
Minimize the join latency, which is the time it takes for the first host member on a subnet to begin 
receiving group traffic.  
Multicast routing is more complex than unicast routing. With unicast routing, unicast traffic is 
forwarded to a globally unique destination. Unicast routes summarize ranges of globally unique 
destinations. Unicast routes in the network are comparatively consistent and only need to be 
updated when the topology of the IP network changes. 
With multicast routing, multicast traffic is forwarded to an ambiguous group destination. Group 
addresses represent individual groups, and in general, cannot be summarized in the multicast 
forwarding table. The location of group members is not consistent, and the multicast forwarding 
tables of multicast routers might need to be updated whenever a host group member joins or leaves 
a host group. 
Just as unicast routing protocols update the unicast IP routing table, multicast routing protocols 
update the IP multicast forwarding table.  
Routing and Remote Access in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 does not include 
any IPv4 or IPv6 multicast routing protocols, although it provides a platform on which third-party 
IPv4 multicast routing protocols can run. The only component provided with Windows Server 2008 
and Windows Server 2003 that can update entries in the IPv4 multicast forwarding table is the 
IGMP routing protocol component of Routing and Remote Access.

Multicast Addresses 
Multicast addresses are defined for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. 
IPv4 Multicast Addresses 
IPv4 multicast addresses, also known as group addresses, are in the class D range of 224.0.0.0/4 (from 
224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255) as defined by setting the first four high order bits to 1110. Multicast 
addresses in the range 224.0.0.0/24 (from 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255) are reserved for the local subnet 
and are not forwarded by IPv4 routers regardless of the TTL value in the IPv4 header. The following are 
examples of reserved IPv4 multicast addresses: 
224.0.0.1 - all hosts on this subnet 
224.0.0.2 - all routers on this subnet 
224.0.0.5 – all Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routers on a subnet 
224.0.0.6 – all OSPF designated routers on a subnet 
224.0.0.9 - Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Version 2 
For the current list of reserved IPv4 multicast addresses, see 
http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses. 
Mapping IPv4 Multicast to MAC-Layer Multicast 
To support IPv4 multicasting, the Internet authorities have reserved the multicast address range of 01-
00-5E-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF for Ethernet MAC addresses. To map an IPv4 multicast address 
to a MAC-layer multicast address, the low order 23 bits of the IPv4 multicast address are mapped 
directly to the low order 23 bits in the MAC-layer multicast address. Figure A-2 shows the mapping of 
an IPv4 multicast address to an Ethernet multicast address. 
Figure A-2  Mapping IPv4 multicast addresses to Ethernet multicast addresses 
For example: 
The IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.1 is mapped to 01-00-5E-00-00-01. 
Appendix A – IP Multicast 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 491 
When mapping the 23 low order bits, the first octet is not used, and only the last 7 bits of the 
second octet is used. The third and fourth octets are converted directly to hexadecimal numbers. 
For the second and third octets, 0 in hexadecimal is 0x00. For the last octet, 1 in hexadecimal is 
0x01. Therefore, the destination MAC address corresponding to 224.0.0.1 becomes 01-00-5E-00-
00-01. 
The IPv4 multicast address 224.192.16.1 is mapped to 01-00-5E-40-10-01.  
For the second octet, 192 in binary is 11000000. If you drop the high order bit, it becomes 1000000 
or 64 (in decimal), or 0x40 (in hexadecimal). For the third octet, 16 in hexadecimal is 0x10. For the 
last octet, 1 in hexadecimal is 0x01. Therefore, the destination MAC address corresponding to 
224.192.16.1 becomes 01-00-5E-40-10-01. 
Because the first 4 bits of an IPv4 multicast address are fixed according to the class D convention, 
there are 5 bits in the IPv4 multicast address that do not map to the MAC-layer multicast address. 
Therefore, it is possible for a host to receive MAC-layer multicast packets for groups to which it does 
not belong. However, IPv4 drops these packets once the destination IPv4 address is determined. 
Token Ring uses this same method for MAC-layer multicast addressing. However, many Token Ring 
network adapters do not support it. Therefore, by default, the functional address 0xC0-00-00-04-00-00 
is used for all IP multicast traffic sent over Token Ring networks. For more information about Token 
Ring support for IPv4 multicasting, see RFC 1469. 
IPv6 Multicast Addresses 
IPv6 multicast addresses have the first eight bits fixed at 1111 1111 (FF00::/8). Therefore, an IPv6 
multicast address always begins with FF. Multicast addresses cannot be used as source addresses or 
as intermediate destinations in a Routing header. Beyond the first eight bits, IPv6 multicast addresses 
include additional structure to identify flags, their scope, and the multicast group. Figure A-3 shows the 
structure of the IPv6 multicast address. 
Figure A-3  The structure of the IPv6 multicast address 
The fields in the multicast address are: 
Flags  Indicates flags set on the multicast address. The size of this field is 4 bits. RFC 4291 defines the 
Transient (T) flag, which uses the low-order bit of the Flags field. When set to 0, the T flag indicates that 
the multicast address is a permanently assigned (well-known) multicast address allocated by the IANA. 
When set to 1, the T flag indicates that the multicast address is a transient (non-permanently-assigned) 
multicast address.  
Scope  Indicates the scope of the IPv6 network for which the multicast traffic must be delivered. The 
size of this field is 4 bits. In addition to information provided by multicast routing protocols, routers use 
the multicast scope to determine whether multicast traffic can be forwarded. Commonly used values for 
the Scope field include 1 for interface-local scope, 2 for link-local scope, and 5 for site-local scope. 
Additional values for the Scope field are defined in RFC 4291. 
Appendix A – IP Multicast 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 492 
Group ID  Identifies the multicast group and is unique within the scope. The size of this field is 112 bits. 
Permanently assigned group IDs are independent of the scope. Transient group IDs are relevant only to 
a specific scope. Multicast addresses from FF01:: through FF0F:: are reserved, well-known addresses. 
To identify all nodes for the interface-local and link-local scopes, the following addresses are defined: 
FF01::1 (interface-local scope all-nodes multicast address) 
FF02::1 (link-local scope all-nodes multicast address) 
To identify all routers for the interface-local, link-local, and site-local scopes, the following addresses 
are defined: 
FF01::2 (interface-local scope all-routers multicast address) 
FF02::2 (link-local scope all-routers multicast address) 
FF05::2 (site-local scope all-routers multicast address) 
For the current list of permanently assigned IPv6 multicast addresses, see 
http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses. 
IPv6 multicast addresses replace all forms of IPv4 broadcast addresses. The IPv4 network broadcast 
(all host bits are set to 1 in a classful environment), subnet broadcast (all host bits are set to 1 in a 
classless environment), and limited broadcast (255.255.255.255) addresses are replaced by the link-
local scope all-nodes multicast address (FF02::1) in IPv6. 
Solicited-Node Address 
The solicited-node address facilitates the efficient querying of network nodes during link-layer address 
resolution, the resolving of a link-layer address of a known IPv6 address. In IPv4, the ARP Request 
frame is sent to the MAC-level broadcast, disturbing all nodes on the network segment, including those 
that are not running IPv4. IPv6 uses the Neighbor Solicitation message to perform link-layer address 
resolution. However, instead of using the local-link scope all-nodes multicast address as the Neighbor 
Solicitation message destination, which would disturb all IPv6 nodes on the local link, the solicited-node 
multicast address is used. The solicited-node multicast address is constructed from the prefix 
FF02::1:FF00:0/104 and the last 24 bits of the unicast IPv6 address being resolved. Figure A-4 shows 
the mapping of unicast IPv6 address to its corresponding solicited node multicast address. 
Figure A-4  Mapping an IPv6 unicast address to its corresponding solicited node multicast address 
For example, Node A is assigned the link-local address of FE80::2AA:FF:FE28:9C5A and is also 
listening on the corresponding solicited-node multicast address of FF02::1:FF28:9C5A (the underline is 
Appendix A – IP Multicast 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 493 
used to highlight the correspondence of the last six hexadecimal digits). Node B on the local link must 
resolve Node A’s link-local address FE80::2AA:FF:FE28:9C5A to its corresponding link-layer address. 
Node B sends a Neighbor Solicitation message to the solicited node multicast address of 
FF02::1:FF28:9C5A. Because Node A is listening on this multicast address, it processes the Neighbor 
Solicitation message and sends back a unicast Neighbor Advertisement message in reply. 
The result of using the solicited-node multicast address is that link-layer address resolutions, a common 
occurrence on a link, are not using a mechanism that disturbs all network nodes. By using the solicited-
node address, very few nodes are disturbed during address resolution. In practice, due to the 
relationship between the link-layer MAC address, the IPv6 interface ID, and the solicited-node address, 
the solicited-node address acts as a pseudo-unicast address for very efficient address resolution. 
Mapping IPv6 Multicast to MAC-Layer Multicast 
To support IPv6 multicasting, the Internet authorities have reserved the multicast address range of 33-
33-00-00-00-00 to 33-33-FF-FF-FF-FF for Ethernet MAC addresses. To map an IPv6 multicast address 
to a MAC-layer multicast address, the low order 32 bits of the IPv6 multicast address are mapped 
directly to the low order 32 bits in the MAC-layer multicast address. Figure A-5 shows the mapping of 
an IPv6 multicast address to an Ethernet multicast address. 
Figure A-5  Mapping IPv6 multicast addresses to Ethernet multicast addresses 
For example: 
The link-local scope all-nodes multicast address of FF02::1 maps to the Ethernet multicast address of 
33-33-00-00-00-01. 
The example solicited-node address of FF02::1:FF3F:2A1C maps to the Ethernet multicast address of 
33-33-FF-3F-2A-1C. 
Multicast Subnet Membership Management 
For multicast subnet group membership, IPv4 nodes use IGMP and IPv6 nodes use MLD. 
Appendix A – IP Multicast 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 494 
IGMP for IPv4 
Routers and hosts use IGMP to manage subnet host membership in IPv4 multicast groups. IGMP 
messages take the following forms: 
When a host joins a host group, it sends an IGMP Host Membership Report message to the all-hosts 
IPv4 multicast address (224.0.0.1) or to the specified IPv4 multicast address declaring its membership 
in a specific host group by referencing the IPv4 multicast address. 
When a router polls a network to ensure that there are members of a specific host group, it sends an
