User: It seems when I try to research all I can find are how many lines are in Linux, call of duty, windows and other things that are massive applications with millions of lines of code.
Does anyone have examples of code size of applications that don't take teams and teams of people?
P.S.
I'm 24 yrs old and just starting to learn I feel like I got a really late start but I'm tired of sales and love technology so I'm just looking for something to gauge by.
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: No, there is no way to gauge or give this type of information. Frankly, it depends.
