L1 will place their output in a buffer read by the network interface
NI1, and that domain N consists of a network of lossy buffers.)
Some of the operations by a domain u on its data components Du
may also involve nondeterminism, e.g., E1 may draw on a local
source of nondeterminism to generate random nonces to be used as
padding in the encrypted messages it constructs.
Suitable access control settings on such nondeterministic com-
ponents that reside within each machine Mi sufﬁce to enforce the
policy.
In particular, consider the access control setting for M1
depicted in Figure 10.

Figure 10: Access Control within machine M1. A bidirectional
arrow u ↔ d between a domain u and a data object d denotes
d ∈ observe(u) ∩ alter(u) whereas a unidirectional arrow
u → d denotes d ∈ alter(u).
Note that all edges indicated are bidirectional, except the edge
from domain L1 to object chanL1,H1. This ensures that L1 may
pass information to H1, but not vice versa. It is straighforward to
check that this access control policy ensures satisfaction of AOI
with respect to the policy in Figure 1.
8. RELATED WORK
The original work on semantics of intransitive noninterference [10,
21] was conﬁned to transitive policies and deterministic systems.
We have already noted, in Section 3, some of the main points of
connection between our contributions in this paper and the volumi-
nous literature on the transitive policy H (cid:54)
(cid:55)→ L in nondeterministic
878systems. We focus here on comparing our work to that of some oth-
ers who have considered semantics for intransitive policies speciﬁ-
cally in the setting of nondeterministic systems.
The earliest work in this vein appears to be that of Bevier and
Young [3]. Unlike most of the subsequent work, Bevier and Young
are alert to the issue of collusion: they present an example to jus-
tify a component of their deﬁnition as necessary in order to deal
with inferences by groups of agents. Moreover, their deﬁnition im-
plies a type of persistence, in that it places requirements on future
views from all pairs of states related by an equivalence relation
(hence also from all individual states compared to themselves.)
The equivalence relations used are the concrete relations deﬁned
by s ∼X t iff obsu(s) = obsu(t) for all u ∈ X, where X is a set
of domains. Additionally, their deﬁnition refers to versions of the
intransitive purge functions ipu and the equivalence relation and
viewu(r) = viewu(r(cid:48)) that generalize the single domain u to a
list of domains. Unfortunately, a deﬁnition of neither generaliza-
tion is provided. Our distinction between post-hoc and run-time
coalitions shows that there are in fact several plausible candidates
for such a generalization — it is unclear which approach was in-
tended by Bevier and Young. They also give a corresponding def-
inition of unwinding, which is also based on the speciﬁc concrete
equivalence relation of observation identity (although they discuss
the fact that the analyst might tailor the deﬁnition of observation).
Thus, although this work is close ours in the mix of concerns fac-
tored into the deﬁnition of security, it differs in the use of a speciﬁc
concrete equivalence relation and its basis in ip rather than ta, and
failed to notice subtleties concerning the treatment of coalitions.
Roscoe and Goldsmith [19] considered the application of the no-
tion of local determinism within the setting of the process algebra
CSP to give semantics to intransitive policies: they give two ver-
sions, one using a lazy abstraction operator, the other using a mixed
operator that gives special treatment to signal events. It is shown
in [23] that, in the special case of deterministic systems, the lazy
abstraction approach corresponds to the application of the purge
function of NI to nondeterministic systems, and the mixed abstrac-
tion approach corresponds to a notion of security van der Meyden
calls ITO-security: this differs from TA security in that it uses func-
tions that are like tau, but which track information about observa-
tions as well as information about actions. Thus, both deﬁnitions
differ from the TA-based deﬁnitions we have presented. The issue
of collusion is not considered in [19], however, semantics of a pol-
icy is given by checking for ﬂows of information to each individual
domain u from the noninterfering domains (cid:54)
(cid:55)→u, considered jointly.
Mantel [13] enriches the type of security policies we have con-
sidered (by distinguishing between observable, deducible and non-
interfering events) and studies the extension of his (trace-based)
Basic Security Property compositional approach to deﬁnitions of
security for H (cid:54)
(cid:55)→ L to this richer policy setting. His deﬁnitions
make use of a restricted quantiﬁcation over sets of domains. How-
ever, the intended effect of this quantiﬁcation is not to capture col-
lusion attacks, but to spread the local purge-like effect of the basic
security properties to simulate ip-like noninterference conditions.
He also proves soundness of an unwinding proof technique.
Another deﬁnition of intransitive noninterference in nondeter-
ministic systems is given by von Oheimb [26]. His approach is
also based on the ip function, but relates this to ﬁnal observations
in a run. As we noted in Section 3.3, this may be inappropriate in
nondeterministic systems. A notion of unwinding is also presented
that is similar to ours, in that it quantiﬁes over sets of domains.
However, the motivation for this appears to have been to obtain a
soundness result for unwinding, rather than an overt recognition
of the possibility of collusion attacks, since these are not acknowl-
edged in the deﬁnition of security.
Bismulation-based deﬁnitions of security (an approach that is
closely related to unwinding) are considered in the context of the
very speciﬁc intransitive policy HDL in [5]. This work deals with
the persistence dimension, but it is not clear how to generalize the
deﬁnitions to policies richer than HDL. Gorrieri and Vernali [9]
deﬁne similar notions of noninterference for the H (cid:54)
(cid:55)→ L and HDL
policies on labelled transition systems and elementary Petri nets:
the emphasis here is on the particularities of these semantic mod-
els rather than essential novelty in the semantics of security, where
they essentially follow [5].
Finally, Backes and Pﬁtzman [1] go beyond the nondeterministic
setting to consider intransitive policies in systems with probabilistic
transitions and cryptographic notions of information-ﬂow. They
give a number of deﬁnitions that take a rather different approach
from the rest of the literature, focussing on whether information
about an initial bit can be transmitted from one party to another,
in some sense "only via particular intermediaries". It would take
some research to clarify relationships to any of the deﬁnitions in
the literature, but, prima facie, it would seem that these deﬁnitions
do not constrain information ﬂow after the ﬁrst transmission by the
intermediaries, as do all the other deﬁnitions.
Of the works discussed above, only von Oheimb applies his re-
sults to a class of Access Control systems, but these are just Rushby’s
deterministic Access Control systems, whereas we have introduced
a more general non-deterministic class of such systems.
9. CONCLUSION
Our focus in this paper has been to present a set of general-
izations of the TA-security semantics for intransitive noninterfer-
ence in nondeterministic systems. We have teased out a number
of parameters of such generalizations, leading to a range of deﬁni-
tions. We characterize the relationships between these deﬁnitions
and provide an unwinding proof technique that is sound for all.
Several issues are left open by this work. The TA style of seman-
tics concentrates of the possibility for attackers to make deductions
about the actions that have been performed.
In a nondetermin-
istic setting, the observations nondeterministically resulting from
these actions may also need to be protected against inference at-
tacks (e.g., when these observations are randomly generated keys).
Some TA-like deﬁnitions (TO-security and ITO-security) that take
observations into account have been presented by van der Mey-
den [24]. It remains to work out how these deﬁnitions should be
generalized to the nondeterministic setting.
Another concern is that whereas unwinding proof techniques
should preferably be complete as well as sound (and some in the
literature achieve both) our technique is just sound. It would be of
interest to have sound and complete proof techniques for each of
our deﬁnitions, in order to cover examples that lie outside of their
intersection. Given the connection we establish between P-nTA
and 0-forward correctability, ideas from Millen’s sound and com-
plete unwinding for forward correctability [16] may be appropriate
in this case.
