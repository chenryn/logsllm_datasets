### Apache Airflow version
2.3.0 (latest released)
### What happened
In the new grid view, tasks are not visible if they contain dots in their name
(but are shown in the details panel and graph view).

### What you think should happen instead
All tasks should be displayed, matching the ones in the detailed panel and the
graph view.
### How to reproduce
Here is a dag that reproduces the problem:
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator
    from datetime import datetime
    dag = DAG("some-test-dag",
              start_date=datetime(2021, 0o2, 17),
              schedule_interval="0 10 * * *",
              max_active_runs=1,
              catchup=False)
    DummyOperator(task_id=f"task_without_dots", dag=dag)
    DummyOperator(task_id=f"task.with.dots", dag=dag)
The task without the dot is displayed, however, the other doesn't.
### Operating System

### Anything else
  * no errors are shown in the console (chrome)
  * the response from `api/v1/dags/some-test-dag/tasks` had two elements
  * the div for the missing task is present in the body (just empty)
  * i spotted the block of code (in packed `tree.js` in chrome) which prevents the task from showing:
                const {task: t, level: n, prevTaskId: a, isParentOpen: i=!0, dagRunIds: u} = e
                  // ...
                  , w = Object(r.useCallback)((()=>d && b()), [b, d])
                  , x = t.id.split("."); v.some((t=>t === e)))); // <--- returns false for tasks containing dots in their name
                 // ....
                }, o.a.createElement(Qb, {
                    in: E,
                    unmountOnExit: !0
                }
  * i couldn't find the split code in Grid or Collapse
