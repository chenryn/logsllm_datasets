Question: "You are reviewing the application routing configuration in a Django application and notice the following code snippet in the urls.py file:

python
from django.urls import re_path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [

    re_path(r'.*^dashboard', views.path_confusion ,name = 'index'),

]


Select the potential vulnerability that this code may introduce and the most suitable remediation action:"
 "A": "The application is vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack due to improper input sanitization and should use parameterized queries to mitigate the issue."
 "B": "The application is susceptible to SQL Injection attacks as a result of this routing and should employ prepared statements to prevent it."
 "C": "This configuration introduces a risk of Web Cache Deception attacks because of the improper regular expression in routing, which should be corrected to match precise path patterns."
 "D": "The code snippet has a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unescaped output and should implement output encoding mechanisms."
Answer: C
