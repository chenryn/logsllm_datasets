### Known ARP Assignments and Attack Detection

During the attack, continuous alerts for 'flip flop' and 'Ethernet mismatch' were generated. The attacking laptop oscillated ARP mappings between the true and false nodes to enable traffic redirection. The attack concluded with a final 'flip flop,' which re-established the original ARP mapping of the gateway IP address to its MAC address. 

The ActionTec router releases DHCP holds after their expiration, leading to some churn in the mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses. This can produce false positives. However, these singular alerts do not exhibit the same characteristics as an ARP poisoning attack, making Arpwatch a useful monitoring tool for detecting MoCA LAN hijacks. While this tool may be beyond the capability of most home users, it is readily integrated into most major Linux distributions, simplifying installation and configuration.

### Network Service Logging and Baseline Establishment

Logging network services on the home LAN is another powerful tool for detecting infiltration. Figure 9 illustrates how establishing network services such as firewalls, proxy servers, and DNS cache forwarders can provide baseline data for normal behaviors and detect deviations from that baseline. When properly instrumented and monitored, the attacker must be flawless to avoid detection. For example, requesting a DHCP lease could trigger the attacker's machine to send background requests to the local DNS cache forwarder. In this instance, the attacker’s laptop was easily distinguished as the only Ubuntu machine requesting updates from Ubuntu.com, while no other legitimate nodes on the LAN ran that operating system.

### Mitigation and Prevention

Once discovered, mitigating a MoCA LAN compromise is as simple as removing the offending equipment and restarting the router. However, this does not prevent the possibility of an alternate backchannel or a recurrence if the attacker returns with new equipment.

One solution is to define static ARP tables on all machines within the internal LAN. While this would prevent the ARP poisoning attack used for traffic redirection, it would be difficult to maintain and require modifications to the access controls within OSP-provided equipment. This makes it an impractical solution.

Another approach is to employ a secure ARP (s-ARP) implementation using public key infrastructure (PKI) technologies to authenticate devices at the MAC layer. This provides authenticated access from a certificate authority present on the LAN. However, this presents several drawbacks, including the need to establish and maintain PKI infrastructure, dictate a static network design, and support non-standard DHCP patches. Additionally, precise time synchronization is required, which many OSP-provided devices cannot adhere to. These requirements make s-ARP implementation on home networks impractical.

### Secure Service Implementations

Beyond OSI Layer 2, secure service implementations can help reduce exposure to attacks or increase the likelihood of detection if ARP poisoning occurs. Creating a local DNS cache forwarder that implements DNSCrypt forwarding to the OpenDNS resolver service tunnels resolution traffic in a way that is not currently exploitable by an attacker. Paired with firewall rules that restrict communication to OpenDNS servers for DNS protocol, the attacker loses the ability to commit DNS rebinding attacks. This also provides an indicator to a user monitoring firewall and DNS resolution logs when the attacker attempts to circumvent or resolve through the forced channel.

Securing all services bridged by the MoCA LAN can be challenging due to the number of services operating on a typical machine. Consumer and OSP-provided devices often do not conform well to the requirements of forced network service architectures, like transparent proxy services, constraining the implementation of a completely secure network architecture.

### Physical Security Measures

The most straightforward way to address the problem involves rewiring the coaxial cables to a splitter within the home that does not leave the exterior wall. This would prevent physical access to the cabling and easy addition of a splitter and MoCA bridge. However, this may be impractical for many existing coaxial deployments and difficult for service providers to maintain. It would also be easy to circumvent, as the coaxial cable to the exterior ONT must exist in the default deployment to support the MoCA WAN, and tools for coaxial cable splicing are readily available. As both MoCA networks share the same physical bus, the MoCA LAN is still accessible through this cable.

Combining the rewiring of the main coaxial splitter within the home with an alternate physical connection from the ONT to the ActionTec router would provide a more secured WAN connection and remove access to the MoCA LAN. An Ethernet interface is available on the ONT to connect to the Ethernet WAN port on the router. Asking the OSP to configure the ONT accordingly and utilizing an armored CAT5e cable to run from the secured ONT box through the home’s exterior wall would present a greater obstacle to an attacker, removing any easily-accessible access point to both the WAN and LAN connections.

### Future Work

Future work includes penetrating the MoCA WAN portion of the coaxial network. With access to both sides of the router NAT, reconnaissance time for LAN nodes not running through the ActionTec’s Ethernet switch would become possible. Penetration of this connection may also provide Layer 2 access to the upstream ISP and neighboring installations, presenting a larger array of targets to compromise for various purposes. Additionally, future work will include an assessment of defenses for both the home and service provider.

### Conclusions

Media over Coaxial Alliance (MoCA) networking protocols provide many attractive features to operational service providers, including guaranteed bandwidth, quality-of-service provisioning, and a robust RF-shielded physical network. However, the common implementation of these broadband services, such as external wiring and splitting, extends the internal local area networks outside the home. With commonly available equipment and software tools, an attacker can take advantage of this MoCA network extension to gain influence and subvert the LAN from outside the walls of the domicile. A single network access point yields access to all hosts on the bridged Ethernet switch—MoCA, Ethernet, and wireless alike. With influence over Layer 2, the attacker can then exploit vulnerabilities in upper layers of the OSI service model to commit reconnaissance, targeted exploitation, and persistent footholds upon discovered devices.

Direct detection of these attacks must occur at the link layer, either via MoCA or through the bridged Ethernet LAN. Without monitoring capabilities, detection of this attack is unlikely until the failure of the router due to ARP table corruption. Indirect detection methodologies were presented but are unlikely to be implemented by consumers of the technology.

The most direct mitigation of this class of attack is for the OSP to end the practice of wiring coaxial networks to terminate at splitters outside the home. Wiring the coaxial network to an interior splitter would raise the effort required for an attacker, necessitating physical damage to the network infrastructure at the network terminator to gain access. Otherwise, the implemented network remains indefensible from any attacker who walks up and takes physical control.
