known ARP assignments. Continued  alerts  for  ‘flip  flop’  and  
‘ethernet   mismatch’   were   produced   as   the   attack   continued  
and the attacking laptop oscillated the ARP mappings between 
the true and false nodes to enable redirection. The end of the 
attack  was  notated  by  a  final  ‘flip  flop’ that re-established the 
original ARP mapping of the gateway IP address to its MAC 
address. As the ActionTec readily releases DHCP holds after 
their expiry, there is some churn in the mapping of MAC 
address to IP address, producing false positives. However, 
these singular alerts do not have the propensity of an ARP 
poisoning attack, making Arpwatch a useful monitoring tool 
for a MoCA LAN hijack. While beyond the capability of most 
home users, this tool has been readily integrated into most 
major 
Linux 
distributions 
making 
installation 
and 
configuration a simple task.  
Figure 9: DNS reconnaissance techniques used to profile 
deviations  from  ‘normal’  baseline  reveals  the  attacker 
Logging of network services upon the home LAN is 
another powerful toolset to leverage against infiltration. 
Figure 9 demonstrates how the establishment of network 
services like firewalls, proxy servers, and DNS cache 
forwarders   can   provide   useful   data   for   baselining   ‘normal’  
behaviors and detecting deviations from that baseline. When 
properly instrumented and monitored, the attacker must make 
no mistakes to avoid detection. For instance, the simple act of 
requesting a DHCP lease could entice the attacker to 
automatically  send  their  machine’s  background  requests to the 
local   DNS   cache   forwarder.   In   this   instance,   the   attacker’s  
laptop was easily distinguished from the other devices 
serviced by the ActionTec router as the only Ubuntu machine 
requesting Ubuntu.com update servers for patches. None of 
the legitimate nodes on the LAN ran that operating system. 
7)  Mitigation & Prevention 
Once 
discovered, 
mitigation 
of 
the 
MoCA 
LAN 
compromise is as simple as removing the offending equipment 
and restarting the router. However, this does not preclude the 
possibility of an alternate installed backchannel or a 
recurrence should the attacker return with new equipment.  
One solution would be to define static ARP tables on all 
machines within the internal LAN [24]. While this would 
preclude the ARP poisoning attack used in this testing for 
traffic redirection, it would be difficult to maintain, and 
require modifications to the access controls within OSP-
provided equipment to enable the user to manipulate these 
system-managed components. Impractical to maintain and 
difficult to access every  node’s  ARP tables without subverting 
existing access controls, this is not a reasonable solution.  
Further, one could employ a secure ARP (s-ARP) 
implementation using public key infrastructure (PKI) 
technologies to authenticate devices at the MAC layer. This 
provides authenticated access from a certificate authority 
present upon the LAN. While a novel idea in the use of 
authentication techniques to definitively identify machines, it 
does present several drawbacks. The PKI infrastructure must 
be established and maintained. Additionally, s-ARP associates 
IP addresses with the credentials, dictating a static network 
design. This presents management and scalability problems 
for a constantly increasing and circulating employment of 
consumer devices within a typical household. DHCP support 
is possible through a non-standard patching of the DHCP 
server, which the implementer then has to maintain. 
Implementation also requires precise time precision of all 
devices to a local time store, a configuration requirement 
many OSP-provided devices cannot adhere to. These 
requirements make implementation of s-ARP upon the home 
network impractical. 
Beyond OSI layer 2, secure service implementations can 
help reduce the exposure to attack, or at least increase the 
likelihood of detection, should ARP poisoning occur. Creating 
a local DNS cache forwarder that implements DNSCrypt 
forwarding to the OpenDNS resolver service tunnels 
resolution traffic in a way not currently exploitable to an 
attacker [36][37]. Paired with firewall rules that require only 
that   service   to   be   allowed   to   communicate   with   OpenDNS’  
servers for DNS protocol, the attacker loses the ability to 
commit DNS rebinding attacks to redirect hosts to malicious 
destinations [38]. It also provides an indicator to a user 
monitoring firewall and DNS resolution logs when the 
attacker attempts to circumvent or resolve through the forced 
channel. 
Securing all services bridged by the MoCA LAN can be 
daunting considering the number of services operating upon a 
normal machine. Consumer and OSP-provided devices 
frequently do not conform well to the requirements of forced 
network service architectures, like transparent proxy services. 
Thus the implementation of a completely secure network 
architecture is constrained.  
The most straightforward way to engage the problem 
involves rewiring the coaxial cables to a splitter within the 
home that does not leave the exterior wall. This would prevent 
physical access to the cabling and easy addition of a splitter 
and MoCA bridge. However, this may prove impractical for 
many existing coaxial deployments and be difficult for service 
providers to maintain. It would also be easy to circumvent as 
the coaxial cable to the exterior ONT must exist in the default 
deployment to support the MoCA WAN, and tools for coaxial 
cable splicing are readily available. As both MoCA networks 
share the same physical bus, the MoCA LAN is still 
accessible through this cable. 
Combining the rewiring of the main coaxial splitter within 
the home with an alternate physical connection from the ONT 
to the ActionTec router would provide a more secured WAN 
connection and remove access to the MoCA LAN. An 
Ethernet interface is available on the ONT to connect to the 
Ethernet WAN port on the router. Asking the OSP to 
configure the ONT accordingly and utilizing an armored 
CAT5e cable to run from the secured ONT box through the 
home’s   exterior   wall   would   present   a   greater   obstacle   to   an 
attacker, removing any easily-accessible access point to both 
the WAN and LAN connections.  
IV. FUTURE WORK 
Future work includes penetrating the MoCA WAN portion 
of the coaxial network. With access to both sides of the router 
NAT, reconnaissance time for LAN nodes not running 
through   the   ActionTec’s   Ethernet   switch   would   become  
possible. Penetration of this connection may also provide 
layer 2 access to the upstream ISP and neighboring 
installations. This may present a larger array of targets to 
compromise for a variety of purposes. 
Work would also include an assessment of defenses for 
both the home and service provider. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
Media over Coaxial Alliance networking protocols provide 
many attractive features to operational service providers. 
Guaranteed bandwidth, quality-of-service provisioning, and a 
robust RF-shielded physical network help the OSP to provide 
reliable, easily maintained service to customers for their high-
demand entertainment requirements. However, the common 
implementation of these broadband services , such as external 
wiring and splitting, extend the internal local area networks 
outside the home. With commonly available equipment and 
software tools, an attacker can take advantage of this MoCA 
network extension to gain influence and subvert the LAN 
from outside the walls of the domicile. A single network 
access point yields access to all hosts on the bridged Ethernet 
switch – MoCA, Ethernet, and wireless alike.  With influence 
over layer 2, the attacker can then influence vulnerabilities in 
upper layers of the OSI service model to commit 
reconnaissance,  targeted exploitation, and persistent footholds 
upon discovered devices. 
Direct detection of these attacks must occur at the link layer, 
either via MoCA or through the bridged Ethernet LAN. 
Without monitoring capabilities, detection of this attack is 
unlikely until the failure of the router due to ARP table 
corruption. Indirect detection methodologies were presented, 
but are unlikely to be implemented by consumers of the 
technology.  
The most direct mitigation of this class of attack is for the 
OSP to end the practice of wiring coaxial networks to 
terminate at splitters outside the home. This simple fix – 
wiring the coaxial network to an interior splitter – would raise 
the effort of the attacker, requiring them to physically damage 
the network infrastructure at the network terminator to gain 
access to it. Otherwise, the implemented network is 
indefensible from any attacker who walks up and takes 
physical control.
