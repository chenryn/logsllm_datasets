# Bug Report

## Summary
I have a "Hello World" application built using Next.js 9.0.1, and it does not work when run in a Docker container.

## Detailed Description
The application runs as expected locally but fails during the build process in a Docker environment. The error occurs specifically at the `yarn run build` step within the Dockerfile.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/WillowHQ/dockerIssue
2. Run the following commands locally:
   ```sh
   yarn
   yarn run build
   yarn run start
   ```
   - The application should work as expected.
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t cgcweb .
   ```
   - The build context is sent to the Docker daemon (1.076MB).
   - The Docker build process starts with the following steps:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:8.9.4
     COPY . .
     RUN rm -rf node_modules
     RUN rm -rf .next
     RUN rm yarn.lock
     RUN yarn install
     RUN yarn run build
     ```

## Expected Behavior
I expect the Next.js application to build and run successfully within the Docker container.
