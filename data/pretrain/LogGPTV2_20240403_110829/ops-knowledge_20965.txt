Question: "Why would simply blacklisting IP addresses not be an effective strategy to mitigate a DoS attack where the attacker is using IP spoofing? (Select two.)"
 "A": "IP spoofing allows the attacker to generate a unique source IP address for every packet, making blacklisting impractical."
 "B": "Blacklisting legitimate IP addresses may result in denying service to genuine users and exacerbate the DoS situation."
 "C": "The attacker is likely to run out of spoofed IP addresses, making blacklisting eventually effective."
 "D": "Most DoS attacks do not use IP addresses at all, so blacklisting would not impact the attack."
Answer: AB
