fraction of suspicious trafﬁc and, hence, are most likely to partici-
pate in fraudulent activities.
Impressions per cookie/IP features: The number of impressions
per cookie and the number of impressions per IP address were the
best indicators for fraudulent activity (and cookies perform better
than IP addresses). The good performance of the impressions-per-
cookie detector is likely a result of cookie replay attacks, where
286one cookie ID is used over a long period of time to generate many
impressions (see Section 5.1).
CTR per cookie/IP features: Interestingly, the CTR (click through
rate) features, both per cookie and per IP, perform very badly for
fraud detection. This is most likely because CTRs are closely mon-
itored in the ad industry, and having publishers or users with very
high CTRs is one of the simplest indicators of fraud. Thus, fraud-
sters who want to survive in the exchange need to keep their CTR
low to remain undetected.
Revenue per cookie/IP features: Because the number of impres-
sions and the publisher’s revenue are related, one would expect that
the two feature sets perform fairly similarly.
Interestingly, how-
ever, publisher revenue models perform much worse. This could
be the result of RightMedia’s performance-based pricing model,
which devalues impressions from publishers who do not exhibit
measurable gain to advertisers (in the form of purchases or con-
versions). Thus, it is signiﬁcantly easier for fraudsters to generate
impressions rather than actual revenue without a sophisticated sys-
tem or human user to issue conversions. As we will show in Sec-
tion 5.4, we found a malicious publisher that was generating a very
large amount of trafﬁc, but that had an eCPM of only $0.02. Be-
cause the eCPM of fraudulent publishers tends to be lower, they are
less likely to have unusually high publisher revenue from a single
cookie or IP address.
Unique IP Addresses per cookie feature: When studying the ad
fraud botnet, we observed that the same cookie was reused by mul-
tiple different machines. Thus, one would expect the number of
unique IP addresses per cookie to be effective at detecting fraud
(in particular cookie replay attacks that are perpetrated across a
number of machines). However, we found that this feature pro-
duces many incorrect detections. In particular, we found that there
are several sites (mostly forums) where users login with the same
cookie ID from many different networks (which is also due to net-
works that frequently assign new IP addresses to its clients). These
sites also increased the false positive rate of our impression-based
feature because users would remain or revisit the site with the same
cookie or IP address over and over again, thus generating many ad
requests with that cookie/IP address. The presence of such sites is
one of the reasons why gleaning reliable fraud data from an impres-
sion stream is difﬁcult for an individual ad network.
Deviation of CTR feature: This model successfully detected a num-
ber of malicious publishers that seemed to have used automated
tools to convert impressions into clicks. However, since not all ma-
licious publishers were using simple, automated tools to commit
fraud, the overall detection capability of this feature was modest.
Note that our models operate under the assumption that each
cookie ID and IP address belongs to a unique user, and they re-
port fraud when a cookie or IP exhibits behavior inconsistent with
the behavior of a single user. However, as mentioned previously,
RightMedia only provides the ﬁrst three octets of an IP address to
an ad network, and, in addition, network address translation (NAT)
might hide many users behind a single IP address. As a result, a sin-
gle IP address value could encompass a large number of individual
users. Thus, cookie-based detection techniques typically produce
more consistent results than IP-based techniques.
5. OBSERVATIONS
In this section, we examine anomalies that our results indicate as
fraudulent activities in the RightMedia ad exchange. In particular,
based on our study of ten days of ad trafﬁc, we observed a number
of patterns that are associated with fraudulent activity. We looked
for similar patterns in our entire data set, which contains trafﬁc
for a much longer period of time (speciﬁcally, four months from
February 2011 until April 2011). This section presents some of our
interesting ﬁndings.
5.1 Cookie Replay Attacks
As a result of cookie impression analysis on the data feed, we
were able to ﬁnd a number of instances of cookies that had many
hundreds or thousands of impressions spread over a week or more.
In particular, there was one cookie ID that was consistently generat-
ing trafﬁc during the entire time period we analyzed (up to Septem-
ber 2011), and was active before the start of 2011. We observed
this cookie’s behavior in NETWORKX’s local trafﬁc, arbitrage traf-
ﬁc, and auction trafﬁc. Normally, a cookie is associated with a sin-
gle browser instance, and thus a single unique IP address, browser,
and geographic region. However, the data for the suspect cookie
indicated that the cookie was coming from 28 different types of
browsers, 746 global regions on 666,429 different 24-bit IP sub-
nets, and using 28 browser languages. We also observed this cookie
coming from 236 unique local publisher accounts. The cookie’s
conversion rate is 18 times greater in Table 3 than for the overall
trafﬁc in Table 1. Because of the large amount and uncharacter-
istic nature of this cookie’s trafﬁc, we consider it and other cases
of cookies with very large amounts of trafﬁc a type of fraud we
call cookie replay attacks.
The reason why an attacker would randomize the browser ver-
sion, language, and other ﬁelds, but not refresh the cookie value
is that cookies set by RightMedia are encrypted with a server-side
key, and a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is
used to verify its integrity. Thus, generating new values to pop-
ulate the cookie ﬁeld of the HTTP header of an ad request is not
trivial. To set the cookie properly, the browser must execute some
client-side JavaScript embedded within the ad tag that is able to
generate the encrypted cookie. Of course, this is possible to auto-
mate (our reverse auditing system used Selenium to do it), but this
limits potential fraud, both in processing resources and because the
IP address ﬁeld cannot be spoofed when querying the servers for
the cookie ID.
From the local publisher trafﬁc ﬂow, which constituted 7% of
all NETWORKX’s trafﬁc, we calculated that the cookie was gener-
ating $32 in revenue for the fraudster per month, and costing ad-
vertisers $56 per month. Since these values were collected from
only the local trafﬁc ﬂow, the real amount of fraud across the en-
tire exchange would be much larger than this. To get an idea of
how much the fraud scales across the exchange, we looked at how
much revenue the cookie was generating across all the trafﬁc pass-
ing through NETWORKX, and found that the cookie was generat-
ing $235 in revenue and $409 in cost every day. However, it is im-
portant to highlight the fact that NETWORKX is just one of several
hundred ad networks in the RightMedia exchange, so the potential
loss due to fraud from this type of operation is likely far greater.
Despite the loss from these attacks, it appears that the current fraud
systems that are in place are not yet effective enough to detect this
type of activity.

Interestingly, we identiﬁed trafﬁc that originated from Amazon’s
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and that was being used to perpe-
trate a portion of these cookie replay attacks. While ad trafﬁc from
the cloud is not by itself suspicious (Web users may proxy browser
trafﬁc through the cloud), we observed the cookie ID discussed
previously being used in a large number of requests that originated
from the cloud from April 10, 2011 to April 13, 2011. Thus, we
believe that this is a strong indication that attackers are using Ama-
zon’s cloud (possibly the free tier that allows for 30GB of transfer
per month) to generate fraudulent ad impressions and clicks.
5.2 Spooﬁng the Referrer
Referrer spooﬁng is performed by clickbots that want to hide
their fraudulent trafﬁc across multiple referrers, so that large num-
bers of impressions do not come from referring domains that are
not very popular or well-known. The bots rotate through a list of
referrers while performing the fraud, but they always use a section
ID that the fraudster owns. We observed this type of fraud on the
click fraud botnet command and control server that we had access
to. In February and March of 2010, we observed the command-
and-control server issuing large numbers of referrers to the bots
that included both the fraudster’s sites and popular sites that they
could not have owned, such as citibank.com. A year later, in April
2011, we observed the command-and-control server issuing only a
few possible referring URLs, which only included the fraudster’s
fake sites. We suspect that this change in behavior was caused by
the fact that RightMedia realized that their trafﬁc was coming from
a wide variety of referrers that did not match their registered pub-
lisher websites. According to RightMedia’s online user guide, “If
the [referer] report shows a long list of unfamiliar domains for a
publisher, it is likely that the publisher has provided their tags to
adware or spyware companies for their own proﬁt” [4]. To avoid
being caught by this kind of simplistic detection scheme, a mali-
cious publisher would simply include a less varied list of domains
in the Referer ﬁeld of their fabricated HTTP request.
In the
following section, we analyze other publishers that exhibit similar
behavior.
5.3 Unrecognized Referrers
During our manual analysis phase we became interested in look-
ing at unrecognized referrers and why they would be generating
impressions for a particular section. We deﬁne an Unrecognized
Referrer as any referring site that did not register the section ID
that they are using to generate ad trafﬁc. In RightMedia, section
IDs are allowed to be placed on sites other than the site that the
publisher had originally registered with, so simply observing that
a section is getting impressions from unrecognized referrers is not
enough to classify the impressions as fraud. Thus, we were not able
to develop an automated way to detect fraudulent activity based on
the Referer ﬁeld (which can be spoofed anyway, as we saw in
the previous section), but we did unearth a number of attacks that
can be perpetrated as a result of this policy. Because local publisher
trafﬁc is the only trafﬁc with the Referer ﬁeld set, we could only
perform this analysis on local trafﬁc, and we found that unknown
referrers made up 43.2% of the trafﬁc. The results of our analysis
for April 2011 are outlined in Table 4. We looked both at publish-
ers that had a large number of impressions from unknown referrers
and those that used a large variety of unknown referrers. From this,
we were able to observe a number of sites whose registered do-
mains were no longer active but were still generating impressions
through other domains, which we will discuss in the next section.
In addition, this analysis allowed us to identify a malicious pub-

5.3.1 Missing-In-Action Sites
It was interesting to see that many publishers had homepages
that were down, yet they were still generating impressions from
other referring sites. We call such sites Missing-In-Action (MIA)
sites. We calculated that out of NETWORKX’s 1,600 publishers,
10% had unreachable domains and 5% were 404 errors, which did
not include publishers whose domains were now parking pages.
While looking at these sites, we observed a speciﬁc instance of a
local NETWORKX publisher who was performing a kind of mis-
representation fraud with his MIA site. This allowed the publisher
to host ads on a page that had illegal content that violated Right-
Media’s terms of use. First, the fraudster registered as a benign
publisher, in this case PUBLISHERC’s site, and received a num-
ber of section IDs to use on the site from NETWORKX, who did
not ﬁnd anything wrong with the site’s content. Instead of plac-
ing the ad tags on the benign site, the fraudster placed them on a
site that contains illegal content, in this case something like full-
free-games.com. Because there is no check to ensure the referrer
matches the page, impressions generated from full-free-games.com
still made money for the fraudster.
5.4 Malicious Publishers
By analyzing cookie replay attacks and unknown referrers, we
were able to identify a particularly malicious publisher who was the
source of a large amount of fraudulent trafﬁc for NETWORKX. This
publisher, which we call PUBLISHERA, had three section IDs that
had already been shut down by RightMedia for generating fraud-
ulent trafﬁc, but he was still perpetrating fraud with one section
ID that had not been ﬂagged. We ﬁrst investigated this publisher
because it had by far the most unknown referring domains and im-
pressions from these domains, as shown in Table 4. Because many
of the impressions were coming from seemingly random sites, there
was evidence of an ongoing referrer spooﬁng attack. In addition,
we computed that this publisher was generating 20% of the sus-
picious cookie trafﬁc but accounted for only 0.2% percent of all
of NETWORKX’s local publisher trafﬁc. After being notiﬁed of our
results, those in charge at NETWORKX decided to take action and
ban PUBLISHERA from their network.
PUBLISHERA’s historical data provides us with insight into the
amount of money a fraudulent publisher can make through a single
ad network. PUBLISHERA was part of NETWORKX from July 2010
to May 2011, and over that period earned approximately $6,700 on
277,043,885 impressions. This means his eCPM was only $0.02.
The fact that he had such a low eCPM is evidence of RightMedia’s
performance-based pricing, which results in the drop of a pub-
lisher’s CPM if these publisher’s impressions do not bring mea-
surable revenue to advertisers.
2886. FRAUD IN AD EXCHANGES
Although the RightMedia exchange contains a number of fea-
tures to monitor the legitimacy of trafﬁc and provide historical re-
porting to each ad network, we know from analyzing the data feed
that a large amount of fraud goes unnoticed. The nature of online
ad serving and ad exchanges is such that there is not a strong sense
of accountability between entities in the exchange. This is done
to protect the privacy of these entities, but it also keeps the ad net-
works from being able to do adequate checks on the validity of their
own trafﬁc.
6.1 Suppression of Data Fields
The lack of accountability in the exchange is likely done to pro-
