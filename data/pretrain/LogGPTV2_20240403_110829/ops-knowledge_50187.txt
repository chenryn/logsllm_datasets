User: I need to generate some token that can only take on a range of characters, [a-zA-Z0-9_]
I'm trying to work with binascii.b2a_base64(os.urandom(64)), which has other characters such as + and are causing problems.
What's the range of /dev/urandom (i'm on linux) so that I can just map the output integers to a value uniformly myself.
Assistant: It generates bytes, so 0x00 to 0xFF inclusive.
