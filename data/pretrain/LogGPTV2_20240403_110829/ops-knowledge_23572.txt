User: Using Docker container technology, build a development environment and deploy applications.
Assistant: 1. Install Docker To use Docker container technology, we need to install Docker on the computer first. Docker can be downloaded from the official website https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ and supports multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux and MacOS. 2. Create a Dockerfile Dockerfile is a file used to build a Docker image. This file describes how to build images, including basic image types, system applications, running scripts, etc. For example: # Based on CentOS mirror FROM centos # Install Apache2, PHP, MariaDB and other software RUN yum install -y httpd php mariadb-server mariadb # Copy application code ADD MyApp /var/www/html # Run Apache2 and MariaDB CMD ["/ usr/bin/supervisord"] 3. Build a Docker image Use the following command to build a Docker image on the local computer: docker build -t myapp:1.0 . Among them, the t parameter indicates the image name and version number to be built, and the image name before the colon , after the colon is the version number. The symbol "." indicates the Dockerfile in the current directory. 4. Start the Docker container Use the following command to start the Docker container on the local computer: docker run -p 8000:80 -d myapp:1.0 Among them, the p parameter indicates that port 8000 of the local computer is mapped to port 80 of the Docker container. The d parameter indicates to run the container in the background. 5. View the running status of the Docker container Use the following command to view the status of the Docker container: docker ps Among them, ps is the abbreviation of "process status", which means to display the process status of the container. 6. Access the application Enter the address http://localhost:8000 in the browser of the local computer to access the application deployed in the Docker container.
