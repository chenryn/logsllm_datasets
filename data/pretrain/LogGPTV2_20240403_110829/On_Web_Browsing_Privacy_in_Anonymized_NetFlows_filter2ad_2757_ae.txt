### Analysis of Web Page Detection in Anonymized Network Data

#### Introduction
The front pages of both cnn.com and nytimes.com are characterized by rapidly changing news items, a significant number of advertisements, and extensive content delivery networks. Despite the frequent changes, our detection accuracy for these sites differs significantly. We can detect nearly half of the occurrences of cnn.com in live network data, while we never successfully detect nytimes.com. This discrepancy is explored further in the following sections.

#### Comparison of cnn.com and nytimes.com
In Table 4, we observe that both web pages have similar means and standard deviations for flow size and the number of physical servers. This similarity likely stems from the nature of the content provided by these sites. However, the number of flows per web browsing session for nytimes.com is nearly double that of cnn.com. Additionally, nytimes.com exhibits high variability in the number of flows it generates, whereas cnn.com maintains a relatively stable number of flows across all sessions. This variability makes it difficult to construct high-quality kernel density estimates (KDE) for the logical servers supporting nytimes.com, leading to poor detection performance.

| Feature | cnn.com | nytimes.com |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Mean Number of Flows | 18.44 | 12.79 |
| Std. Dev. Number of Flows | 30.69 | 15.32 |
| Mean Flow Size (KB) | 568.20 | 286.95 |
| Std. Dev. Flow Size (KB) | 692.87 | 298.73 |

#### Metrics and Detection Rates
Another interesting result from our live network evaluation is that some web page models, such as yahoo.com, have an exceptionally low false detection rate, while others, like google.com, have one of the highest. Both web pages, however, provide adequate true detection rates. Table 5 highlights the distinct behaviors of google.com and yahoo.com for each feature.

| Feature | google.com | yahoo.com |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Mean Number of Flows | 1.73 | 9.02 |
| Std. Dev. Number of Flows | 0.56 | 3.02 |
| Mean Number of Physical Servers | 1.03 | 5.25 |
| Std. Dev. Number of Physical Servers | 0.17 | 1.79 |
| Mean Flow Size (KB) | 13.64 | 219.51 |
| Std. Dev. Flow Size (KB) | 10.37 | 187.26 |

Google.com transfers very little data, typically involving only one physical server and one or two flows per session. In contrast, yahoo.com serves significantly more data, involves multiple physical servers, and opens several flows per session. The variability in flow sizes for yahoo.com is higher due to its dynamic nature. Both web pages exhibit low variability, making them relatively easy to detect. However, the simplicity of google.com's model leads to fewer constraints, resulting in a higher number of false detections. Yahoo.com, with its more complex model, is less likely to produce false positives.

#### Threats and Discussion
Our results show that certain web pages, particularly those with highly variable behavior, may be very difficult to detect in practice. Small, simple web pages are also challenging to identify accurately. Complex web pages with large content delivery networks, on the other hand, can be identified with low false detection rates. The effects of locality, such as private caching servers or proxies, must also be considered, as they can adversely influence true detection rates. Diversification of training data from various locations might help mitigate these issues, but the impact on detection performance is unclear.

When evaluating the privacy threat posed by our web page identification techniques, it is important to consider the information an attacker can reliably gain and the practical countermeasures available. Our techniques allow an attacker to create profiles for specific web pages and determine if at least one user has visited them, provided the pages are sufficiently complex. While the attacker cannot pinpoint the specific user, the information leakage can still be concerning.

Practical concerns, such as the use of ad-blocking software and web accelerators, can alter web page profiles, making it more difficult for attackers to build robust profiles. Our analysis suggests that anonymization offers less privacy to web browsing traffic than previously thought, and a class of web pages can be detected in flow traces by a determined attacker.

#### Conclusion
In this paper, we analyze the threats that publishing anonymized NetFlow traces poses to the privacy of web browsing behaviors. Our study addresses challenges such as the effects of network locality, browser caching, and content distribution networks. Our results contradict the belief that small, static web pages are the easiest to identify, highlighting the importance of considering real-world conditions. We conclude that a non-trivial amount of information about web browsing behaviors is leaked in anonymized network data, suggesting that anonymization provides less privacy than once thought.
