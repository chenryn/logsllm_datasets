Some programming languages leave binary compiled files to the source tree by
default. `.pyc` files in Python being the most notably example.
Together with `tree-view` `hideIgnoredNames` being false by default this makes
navigation in the source tree little bit cumbersome due to scrolling through
unnecessary `.pyc` duplicates, as demonstrated in the screenshot below:

What is Atom stance towards "sane defaults"? Could it be acceptable patch to
have `.pyc` in the ignored files by default (thus giving better out of the box
experience), or should things like that go to a separate package which all
Python developers then install? (Though Python highlighter comes with the
default installation.) I am not sure if I want to make a pull request on this,
as I am not aware of the authors stance on the matter like this.
For comparison, Sublime Text & co. seem to hide `.pyc` files by default.
