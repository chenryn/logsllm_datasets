launch the Switched Browser Questionnaire.
Additionally, if no browser was closed within a 24-hour period,
the script launched the Tor Browser Questionnaire. Figure 1
shows the script logic used to select the questionnaire to
present. Source code for the script is available on GitHub2
and was made available to study participants.3
To complement the insight captured via the questionnaire,
we obtained detailed qualitative data in two ways. At the end
of the study, participants provided 2-3 page write-ups reflect-
ing on the experience of using the Tor Browser for routine
online tasks (see Appendix C for the instructions provided
for the write-up). In addition, we conducted brief 10-minute
semi-structured interviews asking participants about the UX
and challenges of using the Tor Browser (see Appendix B for
the semi-structured interview guide). The write-ups and inter-
views served to provide context, add nuance, and corroborate
information gathered via the other mechanisms.

3.2 Study Procedures
The study was deployed as an assignment within an un-
dergraduate course in the Department of Information and
Library Science at Indiana University Bloomington. This sam-
ple is similar to those in previous works [13, 32, 33] and is
composed of novice and non-expert users of the Tor Browser,
a population whose adoption of Tor is particularly important
for making Tor more inclusive and diverse in terms of its user
base.
While the assignment counted toward 10% of the grade
for the course, allowing the assignment data to be used for
research purposes was optional and voluntary. Moreover, the
grading and research aspects of the assignment were kept
completely separate with the course instructor playing no part
in the research and the researchers having no involvement in
the grading. This separation allowed us to avoid potential co-
ercion for research participation and prevent undue influence
of grade considerations on the collected research data. To
maintain anonymity during data collection, each participant
was assigned a unique identifier composed of an alliterative
adjective-noun pair, such as ‘elegant eagle,’ to be used as the
participant ID when providing responses. Participants did
not receive any compensation.
We first sought informed consent for study participation
via a brief in-class presentation on assignment procedures and
requirements followed by answering questions and providing
clarifications as needed. Next, participants received detailed
instructions to download and install the Tor Browser and our
monitoring script. After installation, participants filled out
a brief pre-study questionnaire (see Appendix D). Prior to

successfully installed the Tor Browser and the monitoring
script and set the Tor Browser as default browser on their
primary computer.
The study lasted for one week, beginning Monday and end-
ing the following Sunday. For the entire week, participants
were asked to use the Tor Browser for all online browsing ac-
tivities just as they would use any other browser. As described
above, our script monitored browser processes, presenting
participants with appropriate online questionnaires.4 In some
respects, our approach resembles the Experience Sampling
Method [17] used in other studies [6, 7, 36]. At the end of the
one-week study period, participants were provided guidance
to uninstall our monitoring script and the Tor Browser, if they
desired. Within a few days of study completion, participants
submitted 2-3 page reports on their use of the Tor Browser
during the study. In addition, we interviewed those willing to
talk to us about their experiences. Each interview was audio
recorded, and the audio was destroyed after transcription.
All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of Indiana University
and New York University.
3.3 Data Analysis
A total of 19 students consented to participate in our research
(8 female, 7 male, and 4 who did not provide demographic
information) with ages ranging from 18 to 22 (average 20).
Of the 15 participants who provided demographic informa-
tion, one was Hispanic, two Asian, and the rest Caucasian.
Only 3 of the participants indicated having used the Tor
Browser prior to the study. Overall, we received 121 question-
naire responses (102 Tor Browser questionnaires, 13 Switched
Browser questionnaires, and 6 Other Browser questionnaires)
from 13 of the 19 participants (mean: 9.3, median: 6, and
mode: 7 per participant across the 13 respondents). All 19
participants provided thorough post-study write-ups, and 11
of the 19 agreed to be interviewed.
3.3.1
Issue Categorization. In addition to choosing from the
provided list of categories of issues, the online questionnaires
allowed participants to enter open-ended text responses to
describe the encountered problems. These open-ended re-
sponses were assigned one of the following seventeen labels
generated after examining all collected responses:
(1) Broken Web site
(2) Unresponsive Web site
(3) Streaming Content
(4) Reduced Productivity
(5) Login
(6) Browser Update Required
(7) Browser Dependent Content
(8) Shopping
(9) Specific File Types
(10) Latency
4The questionnaires were hosted on Qualtrics: https://qualtrics.com.
(11) Inconvenience
(12) Tor Traffic Block
(13) CAPTCHAs
(14) Geolocation
(15) Browser Crash
(16) Other
(17) No Perceived Need for the Tor Browser
The above labels were generated by analyzing all of open-
ended text responses across all questionnaires. Voluntarily
provided URLs were used along with the open-ended text to
generate the labels and them to responses. In 83 cases, the
categories selected by the participants matched the labels
assigned to the open-ended responses. In 26 cases, the open-
ended responses and URLs led us to assign labels more
specific than the categories chosen by the participants. In
the remaining 12 cases, the text responses did not match the
categories the participants selected in the questionnaires. In
such cases, we labeled the issues according to the open-ended
text.
After assigning labels to questionnaire responses, some
labels were combined to reflect a higher-level issues, resulting
in the following larger issues:
(1) Broken Functionality
The Web site or some functionality within the Web site
was not accessible via the Tor Browser.
(2) Latency
The Tor Browser was unacceptably slow.
(3) Differential Treatment
The Web site treated Tor traffic differently.
(4) Geolocation
The Web site provided content based on the locale of
the Tor exit node which did not match the participant’s
locale.
(5) Crash
The Tor Browser crashed or encountered an error.
(6) Other
The participant reported an issue not specific to the Tor
Browser.
For instance, the first 9 labels were combined under the
Broken Functionality aspect. Table 1 provides the full list of
issues along with the respective underlying labels and counts.
3.3.2 Qualitative Coding.
Qualitative data collected via write-ups and interviews was
analyzed with techniques based on Grounded Theory ap-
proaches [15]. The first author began coding the qualitative
data after completing the first interview, continuing the cod-
ing process throughout the qualitative data collection activi-
ties. The analysis utilized two stages of coding: open and axial.
During open coding, data was coded sentence-by-sentence
and codes were created without an initial hypothesis. The
first author labeled each sentence with an underlying concept.
Although more attention was given to UX-relevant codes,
sentences were open coded even if they did not contain a
UX issue. Subsequently, the codes were examined for similar-
ity and connections and grouped together into overarching
categories via axial coding. These categories were used to
generate insight pertaining to UX problems faced by our
participants. All coding and categorization was done by the
first author and verified independently by the second author.
RQDA [18] was used for carrying out the qualitative analyses.
4 FINDINGS
Table 1 provides quantitative details on the various issues
reported in the online questionnaires broken down into the
various types of problems falling under each issue. In the
following subsections, we provide details regarding these
issues uncovered by integrating the numeric counts with the
insight gained from the analyses of the qualitative data.
4.1 Broken Functionality and Latency
As Table 1 shows, Broken Functionality and Latency were
by far the most frequently and broadly encountered UX
issues, with 54/121 questionnaires reporting some type of
functional hindrance and 41/121 questionnaires expressing
frustration with latency. Of the 13 participants who filled
out the online questionnaires, 9 reported functionality breaks
while 8 reported slow speeds.
Notably, breaks in desired functionality occurred in a num-
ber of different ways, ranging from completely inaccessible
Web sites to a lack of support for specific operations, such
as the ability to access streamed content. Seven participants
reported sites that did not load within the Tor Browser at all
while six mentioned being able to access a site only partially.
Participants also encountered more specific functional issues,
such as the inability to complete productivity tasks necessary
for work or school, problems with logins, or failure in checking
out online purchases.
“Sometimes the Tor browser simply would fail to load the page
or just continue to load, never reaching its goal of going to
the page that I wanted to go to.” – (P17, M, unspecified age,
write-up)
“In some cases of using Tor, certain Web sites did not work
at all.” – (P3, F, 19, write-up)
Participants reported experiencing great frustration when
they could not access all features of a Web site with reasonable
speed. The most common reason for the frustration was
the impact on productivity. For instance, a few participants
stated that the two-factor authentication scheme deployed
at their workplaces did not function within the Tor Browser.
Some participants could not load specific files, such as PDFs,
while others were unable to access needed translation services.
A few were not able to read news.
“In my opinion, I think the ability to access all sorts of sites
needs to be improved in Tor, along with the overall running
speed.” – (P3, F, 19, write-up)
Anonymity can potentially be useful for a variety of in-
dividuals, such as journalists, activists, law enforcement, or
even ordinary citizens wishing to read the news without fear
of retribution. Therefore, losing the ability to access Web sites
that aid in productivity, learning, and information acquisition
makes many beneficial uses of Tor impossible.
Although slow speeds were found annoying, when we ex-
plained that the latency is an artifact of Tor operations re-
quired to protects identity, many participants stated during
the interviews that in certain circumstances they would be
willing to deal with increased latency for anonymity benefits.
“Yeah, definitely. I didn’t know it was that. I knew that Tor
was a much more secure way to browse the Internet but I
did not know that the slowness of it was part of how it did
it. Now that I know that, if for whatever reason I wanted to
make sure it was really secure, I would definitely use Tor even
though it is slower. I did not know that was a thing! ” – (P5,
F, 19, interview)
“Because, I mean, some things are worth waiting for to make
sure I can accomplish whatever I need to.” – (P7, F, 21,
interview)
Yet, no participant provided specifics regarding the amount
of tolerable latency or the acceptable level of identity protec-
tion, underscoring the difficulties in ascribing precise quanti-
ties to these subjective and contextual needs and experiences.
4.2 Inconvenience
As two of our participants pointed out, the Tor Browser
lacks a number of mechanisms present in other browsers to
make browsing more convenient and efficient, such as easy
access to bookmarks, password saving capabilities, etc. These
two participants often switched to other browsers when they
needed to access a bookmarked site or a saved password that
they could not easily recall.
“The Tor browser also does not provide a lot of the ease of
access quirks that a traditional browser provides. For example,
it does not save your passwords which forces you to put them
in manually every time.” – (P17, M, unspecified age, write-
up)
“To elaborate on what I mean by ‘ease of access,’ because
Google Chrome was my default browser of choice, none of my
bookmarks or pre-saved information (i.e., passwords, payment
information, etc.) were readily available to me while using
the Tor Browser.” – (P12, M, unspecified age, write-up)
While the questionnaire responses indicated the lack of
browser conveniences to be a hindrance and, sometimes,
a cause for switching to an alternate browser, we found
that many participants understood that these conveniences
are often a double-edged sword and including them might
compromise Tor’s anonymity goals.
“I know that the goal of Tor is to allow for anonymity and
privacy, so it does not store any information or have the
capability to save passwords, but it was really inconvenient to
have to log back into things whenever I opened the browser
again.” – (P5, F, 19, write-up)
“I think many of the things the average user would want in a
browser to make usage more efficient would counteract the
anonymity aspect of Tor — things like having a most visited
sites page, having passwords saved for certain sites, and using
bookmarks at the top of the page to make navigating faster.”
– (P14 F, 19, write-up)
“It also did not have some of the useful perks that a normal
web browser has. I had to input my passwords in every time
which is not bad; it is actually good and more secure, just
inconvenient and time consuming.” – (P17, M, unspecified
age, write-up)
4.3 Differential Treatment
Two of our participants stumbled onto Web sites that treated
Tor traffic differently from other network traffic (5 ques-
tionnaire reports). Such differential treatment included total
blockage of traffic coming from known Tor exit nodes and
an incorrect presumption of automated activity or denial-of-
service attempts leading to being presented with CAPTCHAs
for verifying that a human was attempting to access the re-
source.
“I was going to read articles on the online news site der-
spiegel.de and I was trying to open articles, but it would not
let me read them further.” – (P14, F, 19, interview)
Yet, the number of incidences reporting differential treat-
ment was much lower than our expectations based on the
large amount of differential treatment for Tor traffic mea-
sured in the past [26].
4.4 Geolocation
Perhaps surprisingly, only two participants reported issues
due to Web site features that depend on IP address based
geolocation. Interviews and write-ups revealed that wrong
geolocation due to the Tor exit node being located in another
country was particularly problematic when accessing multi-
media content, which is often geographically restricted, or
checking email, which is often timestamped with time zone
determined via geolocation.
“When I tried to get on the site, it told me that Pandora was
not active in my country just yet, just the United States. ” –
(P3, F, 19, write-up)
4.5 Web Searching and Operational
Messaging
Our qualitative analyses surfaced two aspects not captured in
the questionnaire responses: Web searching and operational
messaging.
The default search engine for the Tor Browser is Duck-
DuckGo which claims to provide Web search functionality
without user tracking or record keeping. As a participant
noted, the switch in the default search engine could poten-
tially be confusing:
“Someone who is using Tor and does not understand IP
anonymity may be confused why when they search ‘Google’
in the search bar it turns into ‘DuckDuckGo’ which may lead
users to believe they are doing something incorrect and feel
lost.” – (P18, M, 19, write-up)
Some participants noted a number of undesirable Duck-
DuckGo characteristics, such as a lack of auto-complete ca-
pability, inability to revisit past search results via the ‘Back’
button, etc.
“I personally did not care for DuckDuckGo at all. My one big
complaint is that when I was searching something it would
not autocomplete like Google does. That means I had to know
what specifically I was looking for and how to spell it.” – (P9,
