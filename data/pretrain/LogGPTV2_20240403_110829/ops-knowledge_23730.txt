User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Live view of Linux shell commands executed by another user? Is it possible for the root user in Linux to have a real-time (or close to real-time) view of the shell commands being run by another user logged in via a terminal or SSH? Obviously they're stored in .bash_history, but that's only saved when the user logs off and can be disabled, too.

Edit: ideally something that can easily be switched on and off.

Assistant: as root, you could replace their shell with a simple wrapper script that logged their commands before passing them to the real shell. This would only work prior to them logging in.
