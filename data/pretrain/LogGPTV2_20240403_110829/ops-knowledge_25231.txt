User:  Introduce common Linux server deployment modes.
Assistant: 1. Stand-alone deployment mode The stand-alone deployment mode is to deploy all applications and databases on the same server, which is suitable for small websites or applications. For some small applications, the stand-alone deployment mode is more convenient and economical. 2. Cluster deployment mode The cluster deployment mode is to deploy the same application on multiple servers, and distribute requests to different servers through load balancing technology, which can improve the availability and performance of the application. Commonly used load balancing software includes Nginx, HAProxy, LVS, etc. 3. Distributed Deployment Mode The distributed deployment mode deploys different applications or databases on different servers, using service-oriented architecture (SOA) or micro-service architecture (MSA) technology to achieve data exchange and collaboration through network interconnection Work. 4. Containerized deployment mode The containerized deployment mode uses container technology to package applications and their dependencies into independent containers so that they can run in any environment, such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc. 5. Cloud deployment mode Cloud deployment mode uses public cloud or private cloud, and deploys applications on cloud servers through virtualization technology, which can provide high elasticity, flexibility and scalability. Cloud server vendors include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, etc.
