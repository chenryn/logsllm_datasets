sion chain, as we described in Section 5.1 and in Figure 3.
The data is encoded using the NRZI mapping, which stands
for non-return-to-zero inverted mapping. NRZI is a method
for mapping binary digits to a physical waveform and it is
characterized by two levels (high and low). The mapping
works by having a signal transition on the clock boundary
whenever a logical 0 has to be represented, and by keep-
ing the signal at level whenever a logical 1 is transmitted.
Note that AIS, similarly to USB, adopts a reverse transition
convention with respect to the common use of NRZI.
To conclude, the frame is then packed, i.e. transformed
from a bit to a byte representation in order to ﬁt the mod-
ulation requirements of the following GMSK block.
6. RADIO-FREQUENCY EVALUATION
Our radio-frequency evaluation consists of two experiments.
In the ﬁrst, we conducted an in-lab experiment in which we
used three AIS receivers to verify that our transmitter works
well in practice and can be used to run the attacks we iden-
tiﬁed. Later, we conducted a coverage assessment, in which
we veriﬁed that a malicious actor can perform such attacks
in an open air environment like onshore or open sea, target-
ing real vessels and authorities.
Our experimental setup consisted of a transmitter acting
as an attacker and of a receiver acting as victim (e.g., a ves-
sel or a vessel traﬃc service). For the transmitter, we used
a standard Linux machine running our AISTX transmitter
together with a USRP device, i.e. a commonly used and
well-supported SDR peripheral for transmitting signals over
the air. Our USRP consisted of an Ettus USRP B100 com-
pleted with a WBX-model daughter-board18. This device
was well suited for our requirements because it supports
VHF maritime frequencies. From the receiver standpoint,
we evaluated our ability to generate AIS signals over three
distinct AIS receivers: A commercial and standard class-B

are supported, i.e.
lower-cases are substituted with upper-
cases. Numbers are in decimal notation and negatives are
expressed using a 2’s complement. A padding with zeros
(0’s) to a multiple of 8 bits is done for further processing.
The reason behind the use of such a short alphabet is to
reduce the average message length transmitted over the air.
In the link layer module, we compute a frame check se-
quence of the previous AIS-encoded messaged (i.e., the pay-
load), by using a 16-bit polynomial cyclic redundancy check.
This is used by the receiver to validate the integrity of our
AIS message. We also reorder the bits of the payload from
big-endian to little-endian as per speciﬁcation. Next, ap-
plication of bit stuﬃng occurs – a technique consisting of
inserting a zero (0) if ﬁve consecutive ones (1’s) are found
in the bit stream. Bit stuﬃng reduces the chance of errors
in communication and makes sure that HDLC control infor-
mation is always in the same position.
This control information is added during HDLC framing
and consists of a training sequence and of a start/ending
ﬂag. The training sequence are twenty-four bits of alternat-
ing 0’s and 1’s (010101010...) and is used to synchronize the
receiver to the data stream; the start/end ﬂag consists of
a 8-bit pattern 01111110 (0x7E) and is used to delimit the
payload portion. Although this ﬂag consists of 6 bits of con-
secutive ones (1’s), it is not subjected to bit stuﬃng because
the ﬂag is meant to act as a delimiter. HDLC is used to syn-

receiver called AIS em-track R10020, and a hybrid receiver
(hardware and software). The latest is based on a software-
based AIS receiver21 and a standard YAESU VHF radio,
which we modiﬁed by adding an additional output port in
order to interface the radio with a computer’s audio port and
bypass the ﬁnal-stage audio ﬁlter. Note that we connected
receivers and transmitter by physical cable to prevent any
signal from propagating over the air22.
As said, we used our AISTX transmitter to generate the
appropriate AIS messages and perform the attacks, and the
receivers to validate the threats. We analyzed the receivers’
behavior in three ways: At the hardware layer, at the pre-
sentation layer and at the application layer.
From a hardware standpoint, we equipped the AIS re-
ceivers with alarming lights, in order to observe the behavior
of a transponder installation when an alarm is triggered. At
the presentation layer, we used the serial port provided by
the AIS receivers to monitor the AIS messages received. In
fact, via the serial port, we could see all AIS-demodulated
messages, including those that are not handled by the soft-
ware at the application layer (e.g., message type 22, which is
used to control the operating frequency of the transponder).
Finally, we used a standard chart-plotter software, i.e.
OpenCPN23, to evaluate the receivers’ behavior at the appli-
cation layer. OpenCPN implements a fully-functional chart
plotter for personal computers and supports all AIS mes-
sage types, including SART and CPA alerting. We used
OpenCPN to visually render the results of the received ma-
licious messages, i.e. impersonating the on-board computer
normally installed on vessels. Together with OpenCPN, for
the spooﬁng attacks we also used the oﬃcial monitoring tool
oﬀered by one of the transponders, i.e. EasyTRX2. This en-
abled us to understand how and in which way the target was
impacted by our misleading transmissions.
We started our evaluation by using the AIVDM Encoder
introduced in Section 4 to provide AISTX with valid AIVDM
sentences for the spooﬁng-related attacks. The Listing 3 gives
an example for the generation of an AIS radio message on
channel A (161.975 MHz) for a spoofed vessel called FOO,
having Italian nationality, i.e. the MMSI preﬁx is 247, and
navigating at 100 knots East out of the coast of Sardinia, at
the coordinates 43.01N,8.46E.

For the frequency hopping attack, we veriﬁed that by broad-
casting the message shown in Listing 5 we immediately switched
the receivers to non-standard channel frequencies (i.e., we
lowered their operating frequencies of 4.950 MHz). This
made the devices unavailable to receive, i.e. to know the
position of nearby ships, and to transmit, i.e.
to broad-
cast their positions. Note that this operation was applied
immediately because we speciﬁed a geographical region in-
cluding their current position. As an alternative form of
attack, an attacker can “program” the devices to disappear
from AIS monitoring upon entering a region of interest for
the attacker, for example the sea quadrant of Somalia26.

In
fact, by protocol speciﬁcation and legislation, AIS stations
are required to trigger an alert when a distress beacon is re-
ceived, i.e. informing the captain that a rescue operation is
needed for a man overboard. In our experiments, we exper-
imentally veriﬁed that we could appropriately spoof such
messages and trigger the alert of our three AIS receivers,
both visually and acoustically.
The strategy was to emulate an AIS-SART transmitter
by generating over both AIS channels a class-A position re-
port (i.e. a message type 1) having MMSI in the form of
970YYXXXX: The preﬁx (970) is reserved for AIS-SARTs, op-
posed to other MMSI preﬁxes that specify the country. The
Ys are assigned by CIRM25 and refer to the SART manu-
facturer, while the Xs are sequential digits assigned by the
manufacturer identifying the SART. The command reported
in Listing 4 was used.

Listing 4: Distress beacon (SART) spooﬁng in radio-
frequency.
We have impersonated ﬁctional ships, buoys and other
AIS stations, showing that spooﬁng threats are real and af-
fect standard AIS transponders used worldwide in maritime
traﬃc.
Next, we describe AIS hijacking (ref. Fig 7). Bob, the
victim, communicates its AIS information to Alice, an AIS
receiver installed onshore from authorities or another ship
navigating nearby. The attacker, Mallory, is situated within
the radio-frequency coverage of Bob and Alice’s AIS sta-
tions. She generates a modiﬁed AIS message for Alice, pre-
tending to be Bob, and overrides the legitimate communi-
cation of Bob by transmitting with higher power. Using
a physical cable, we connected Bob’s AIS transponder and
Mallory’s SDR-transmitter to Alice’s receiver’s ports. We
simulated Bob’s lower output power (when compared with
Mallory), by installing a 120 dB attenuator on its connec-
tion with Alice (i.e., 30 dB attenuation more than Mallory).
By monitoring Alice’s receiver, we proved that Mallory is
able to override Bob’s signal, i.e. to tamper with valid AIS
information sent via radio-frequency.
Following, we veriﬁed the availability disruption threats
by using a particular class of AIS messages, called control
messages, which are reserved to port authorities and not
supported in transmission by transponders, i.e. only in re-
ception. Control messages are used by port authorities to
control the maritime traﬃc and have higher priority with
respect to normal AIS traﬃc, e.g. position reports.

panies
Listing 5: Example of availability disruption by fre-
quency hopping.
In a similar attack, that we call timing attack, the at-
tacker inhibits the transmission capabilities of one or more
AIS stations. For example, in the targeted attack of List-
ing 6, she uses VTS-reserved assignment command messages
to instruct a victim to delay the transmission for 15 min-
utes; by iterating through the command, she accomplishes
a denial-of-service attack.
Inversely, the attacker can overload (i.e., ﬂoods) the ma-
rine traﬃc by requesting the existing stations into sending
AIS updates at a very-high rate.

Finally, for the slot starvation attack, we used the message
types 4 and 20 to simultaneously fake a base station installed
at VTS and allocate the AIS transmission “address space”
entirely (i.e., the TDMA slots), in order to consume all slots
and prevent all nearby stations to further operate (both in
transmission and reception).
6.1 Coverage Experiment
In the following, we performed a coverage experiment to
simulate the operational conditions of an attacker, e.g. a
pirate targeting a ship in navigation, and we showed that
our concerns are real. Our coverage experiment consisted of
installing our AIS transmitter at a ﬁxed and deﬁned posi-
tion and a receiving station on a moving car27. Our eval-
uation consisted of generating a harmless testing message
with AISTX and verifying if, and at which distance, the re-
ceiver was able to correctly receive and decode the testing
message. Note that as we extensively discuss in Section 7,
