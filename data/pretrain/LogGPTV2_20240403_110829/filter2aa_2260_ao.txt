NIMS/ICS during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., Incident Commander was not universally 
communicated to exercise participants, Communications Unit Leader was not announced over the radio). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Update the TICP to include After Action Report recommendations and to address SOP issues (i.e., 
activation/deactivation of gateways, radio cache tracking procedures, and shared channel usage) 
• 
Continue to establish and implement formal SOPs within the UA (outside of Douglas County) and 
distribute appropriately 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

Interoperability solutions (e.g., shared channels, shared systems and gateways [console patches]) are used on 
a regular basis in the UA for drug task forces and mutual aid events.  Omaha officials indicated that joint 
drug task forces occur among Sarpy, Douglas, and Washington counties, and shared channels are used to 
effectively provide interoperable communications.  In carrying out the TICP validation exercise, the Omaha 
UA showed effective command and line-level communications across multiple local jurisdictions and 
disciplines (e.g., the Mobile Command Center successfully communicated using shared channels to both 
Washington and Sarpy Counties).  However, some technical and procedural issues were encountered with 
multiple categories of interoperable equipment (e.g., radio labeling and programming issues that did not 
match the fleet map) that did not allow the area to seamlessly use all applicable types of interoperable 
communications assets.  While the exercise met the stated requirements, it did not provide the opportunity to 
demonstrate interoperable communications with state and federal agencies (e.g., Nebraska Emergency 
Management Agency, FBI) in the area.  The UA is encouraged to build on its local exercise success by 
further integrating state, federal and support agencies in future events. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Recommend additional training on how to use radios and available channels 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Omaha UA has two 800 megahertz trunked radio systems with 30 shared talk groups available for all public safety 
agencies.  All public safety agencies in the UA are on these two systems.  There are five conventional interoperable talk 
groups that are shared between the two systems.  Sarpy County has its own system, while Washington County is using 
the Douglas County System, which meets the Project 25 (P25) compliance.  There are multiple console patches and 
Raven fixed gateways for interoperability with ultra high frequency and both high- and low-band very high frequency 
systems.   
Regional communications systems are the accepted method of interoperability in this UA.  The Douglas County P25 
system is likely to be expanded into Pottawattamie County, Iowa.  Sarpy County is planning to obtain funding to join 
the Douglas County P25 System or purchase its own communications system.  The Douglas County System is 
upgrading to Motorola's new 7.x technology that will support integrated voice and data communications.

The Las Vegas Urban Area (UA) includes the City of Las Vegas, as well as jurisdictions within Clark 
County. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
The regional Communications Steering Committee has been in place for 20 years and has taken key steps 
toward communications interoperability since its formation (e.g., established processes for developing and 
formalizing memoranda of understanding).  The Committee supports the Urban Area Working Group on 
communications issues, and oversaw the development of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan 
(TICP).  There are a number of formal agreements among member agencies, and the area has been very 
effective in proactively including public support discipline, state, and federal agencies in the governance 
process (e.g., Committee recruitment from hotel and casino security chiefs association, area hospitals, school 
districts, bus drivers).  The Las Vegas UA has an established strategic plan for interoperability that has been 
accepted by all necessary agencies and is regularly reviewed.  The Las Vegas UA indicated that budgets 
were developed based on regional strategic goals and used a variety of funding sources, including operating 
accounts, subscriptions, and capital funds, as well as grants.  Regional leaders, including the chairman of the 
Urban Area Working Group, have made interoperable communications a priority and are actively engaged in 
all aspects of interoperability.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Reference existing agreements in future communications plans (e.g., updated TICP or regional 
communications plans) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that region wide interoperability needs are met 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The Las Vegas UA has successfully developed and implemented local communications interoperability 
procedures prior to the development of the TICP (e.g., through Southern Nevada Area Communications 
Council [SNACC] efforts), and the SOPs have been fully incorporated into the TICP.  The UA is also 
developing further regionwide communications interoperability SOPs to include agencies beyond first 
responders and communications interoperability assets not captured initially; and plans to incorporate these 
additional SOPs into an updated TICP.  The Las Vegas UA should be commended for taking aggressive 
steps in disseminating these policies (e.g., providing to all agencies and dispatch center; storing applicable 
SOPs with radio caches and gateways).  The TICP validation exercise demonstrated the successful use of all 
applicable communications interoperability SOPs developed for the UA (e.g., the activation and deactivation 
procedures for radio caches were accurately followed).  The National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) has been implemented in the Las Vegas UA SOPs for more than a 
decade, and the successful use of these procedures (including the Communications Unit Leader [COML] 
position) were also fully demonstrated during the Las Vegas TICP validation exercise (e.g., a COML was 
designated and announced to all relevant personnel).

The Las Vegas UA regularly uses three major shared systems to conduct multi-agency communications.  
Because these systems operate on disparate bands and technologies, shared channels and a fixed gateway are 
used on a daily basis to address multijurisdictional needs.  Despite this regular use of interoperable solutions 
and effective demonstration of interoperable communications, some problems were encountered during the 
TICP validation exercise (e.g., the use of the command channel for tactical operations units; no gateway use 
demonstrated).  These problems may have been a result of the limited scope of the TICP validation exercise, 
which did not necessitate the use of a gateway devise, despite the fact that this is a standard interoperability 
tool used in the UA. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Include gateways in future training and exercises to demonstrate proficiency 
• 
Consider including additional state and federal agencies (e.g., Department of Energy) in future exercises 
and day-to-day use 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Technology Overview    
The Las Vegas UA consists of three primary communication systems that most of the agencies in the UA use.  The 
SNACC 800 megahertz (MHz) trunked system operates throughout Clark County supporting most of the city and 
county agencies.  The Las Vegas Police Department (LVPD) uses a conventional very high frequency (VHF) system 
called the METRO system.  The METRO system uses crossband repeaters to link mutual aid channels VHF VTAC to 
800 MHz ITAC and VHF VCALL to 800 MHz ICALL within the UA.  State agencies and Nevada Power primarily use 
an 800 MHz M/A-COM Enhanced Digital Access Communications System ProVoice system that serves the majority of 
the state.  There are also separate systems that cities such as North Las Vegas and Boulder Junction primarily use.   
The LVPD recently awarded a contract to M/A-COM to deploy a 700/800 MHz OpenSky communication system for 
support of the agency’s voice and data needs.  Because the statewide system is also a M/A-COM product, the LVPD 
will be able to share communications interoperability with state users.

The Jersey City/Newark UA has a strong governance structure closely tied to the State of New Jersey.  
Communications in the UA are governed by the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) Interoperability 
Subcommittee, which is a formalized group within the UASI structure.  The UA has formalized agreements 
across the first responder agencies, with every agency signing a memorandum of understanding for 
regionwide communications interoperability.  In addition, agencies such as the Port Authority of New York 
and New Jersey, the New Jersey Department of Health, and the U.S. Coast Guard have been included in the 
Interoperability Subcommittee and agreement process.  The state legislature mandated strategic 
interoperability planning 3 years ago, although no plan has been adopted yet by participating agencies.  The 
UA obtains the majority of their funding from federal grants.  Currently, individual organizations develop 
and maintain their budgets and procure communications equipment with consideration for interoperability 
throughout the UA.  However, the UA should encourage the participating organizations to develop a long-
term strategy to determine or identify diversified or sustained funding that aligns with the regional strategic 
plan, which is under development.  The Jersey City/Newark UA receives support from their leadership to 
obtain funding (e.g., executive committee allocated funding when the UA needed to address problems with 
in-building coverage).   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to be proactive in education efforts across stakeholders (e.g., distribute information through 
speaking engagements, distribute information pamphlets on communications interoperability) 
• 
Encourage all participating agencies to fully adopt the strategic plan  
• 
Encourage the development of a regional interoperability funding strategy, including long-term (e.g., 3 to 
5 years) funding sources that can help leverage costs across jurisdictions (in addition to grants)

disseminate the regional SOPs (e.g., distributed to included organizations and dispatch centers, made 
gateway SOPs available with gateways).  The use of equipment SOPs was successfully demonstrated during 
the TICP validation exercise, and as noted in the After Action Report “[t]he street force demonstrated 
superior understanding of the TICP, only a week after its formal approval and implementation.”  The 
exercise did expose minor gaps (e.g., setting up a unified command that didn’t include all of the participating 
agencies) in the use of the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS),

The Jersey City/Newark UA uses its shared ultra high frequency (UHF) channels on a weekly basis to 
provide communications interoperability and regularly deploys and uses radio caches and gateways.  The 
Jersey City/Newark UA did well with the use of available communications interoperability equipment during 
the TICP validation exercise.  Some minor training issues were encountered during the exercise; for example 
the traffic units were discussing road closures on the same shared channel that the COML was performing a 
radio check until a dispatcher intervened.  Overall, evaluators of the exercise noted that “users were 
proficient with the use of UTAC4, ITAC5, and OEM2 as shared channels” and “the gateway technician was 
proficient with the setup and use of the system.”  
Recommendations: 
• 
Recommend additional training on how to use radios and available channels 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Jersey City Police Department operates a radio system with five UHF conventional channels.  The Jersey City Fire 
Department radio system uses two UHF conventional channels.  The Newark Police Department uses a conventional 
UHF radio system, and the Newark Fire Department uses a conventional very high frequency (VHF) radio system.  
Newark Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is also operating a radio system on the VHF band.  All agencies can use 
the Essex County Sheriff’s Radio System (UHF/VHF) for interoperability.  All agencies also have access to the New 
Jersey Interoperability Communications System, which has eight 800 megahertz channels and nine VHF channels. 
Jersey City is in the process of implementing a UHF trunked radio system for police, fire, and EMS.  Estimated 
completion date is the end of calendar year 2007.  In Newark, there is the possibility of implementing an Essex County 
trunked system to cover all agencies in the county, if funding issues can be resolved.
