##### Description of the problem
When creating a polygon with constructPathShape.toShapes the order of the
constructpathshapes commands plays a role which shouldn't be the case. (I
think so)  
I am adding a hole than the outer vertice then again a hole.  
The last hole is not recognized.

The only thing which was changed is the order of the constructpathshape
commands.  
If I add the two holes at the beginning the polygon is rendered correctly.
