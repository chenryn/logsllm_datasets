User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 correlated_subquery 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This piece of code checks for the presence of sub-queries in SQL execution that cannot be promoted. If the execution plan contains the keyword 'SubPlan' and the SQL structure does not support Sublink-Release, the user needs to rewrite the SQL. The function checks for the existence of such sub-queries and provides suggestions for rewriting the statement to support sublink-release. If there are subqueries that cannot be promoted, it is a root cause of the issue. Otherwise, it is not a root cause.
