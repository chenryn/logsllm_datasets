Question: "You are developing an Android application that requires storing sensitive user data securely. Your application needs to access this data even when the device has not been unlocked by the user after a reboot. Considering the security measures provided by Android's file-based encryption (FBE), which storage locations should you utilize for this requirement, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of your choice?"
 "A": "Use Device Encrypted (DE) storage because it is available during Direct Boot, but it might expose less sensitive data to services before user authentication."
 "B": "Use Credential Encrypted (CE) storage as it is the default and more secure, but the data will only be available after the user has unlocked the device."
 "C": "Use external storage media as it is always accessible, but this approach is less secure due to the potential physical removal of the media."
 "D": "Use adoptable storage with FBE, which combines the security of internal storage encryption with the flexibility of external media, but is not compatible with Android versions before 9."
Answer: A
