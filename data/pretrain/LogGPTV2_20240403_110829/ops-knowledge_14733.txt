Question: Consider the secure boot process for a Mac with Apple silicon, where the LocalPolicy file is signed by the Secure Enclave and the Owner Identity Key (OIK) plays a crucial role. What are the advantages and potential drawbacks of this design?
"A": "The design allows for the secure delegation of local security policy control to the Secure Enclave, enhancing the security against malicious software.",
"B": "Having a single OIK for all operating systems on the Mac simplifies the process of ownership handoff between different operating systems.",
"C": "The requirement for user passwords and measurements of the operating system to protect the OIK could be seen as a drawback due to potential user inconvenience.",
"D": "Storing the OIK on the BAA server provides an additional layer of security by separating the key storage from the local device."
