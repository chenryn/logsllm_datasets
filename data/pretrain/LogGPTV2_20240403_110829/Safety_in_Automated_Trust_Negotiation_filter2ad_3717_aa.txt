Exchange of attribute credentials is a means to establish mutual trust between strangers wishing
to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN) is an
approach to regulate the exchange of sensitive information during this process. It treats credentials
as potentially sensitive resources, access to which is under policy control. Negotiations that correctly
enforce policies have been called “safe” in the literature. Prior work on ATN lacks an adequate
deﬁnition of this safety notion. In large part, this is because fundamental questions such as “what
needs to be protected in ATN?” and “what are the security requirements?” are not adequately
answered. As a result, many prior methods of ATN have serious security holes. We introduce a
formal framework for ATN in which we give precise, usable, and intuitive deﬁnitions of correct
enforcement of policies in ATN. We argue that our chief safety notion captures intuitive security
goals. We give precise comparisons of this notion with two alternative safety notions that may seem
intuitive, but that are seen to be inadequate under closer inspection. We prove that an approach to
ATN from the literature meets the requirements set forth in the preferred safety deﬁnition, thus
validating the safety of that approach, as well as the usability of the deﬁnition.

1. INTRODUCTION
In Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) systems, access control decisions
are based on attributes of requesters. These attributes may be arbitrary prop-
erties of the requester, such as roles he assumes in his home organization,
rights to access speciﬁc resources, licenses or degrees held, age, etc., and are
often documented by digitally signed credentials. A principal proves that it has
an attribute by showing an appropriate set of relevant credentials. Because
attributes (such as ﬁnancial or medical status) may be sensitive, they need
protection. The goal of a growing body of work on automated trust negotia-
tion (ATN) [Hess et al., 2002; Seamons et al. 2001, 2002; Winsborough and Li
2002a, 2002b; Winsborough et al. 2000; Winslett et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2000; Yu
and Winslett 2003b; Yu et al. 2003] is to enable resource requesters and access
mediators to establish trust in one another through cautious, iterative, bilat-
eral disclosure of credentials. The distinguishing characteristic of ATN that
differentiates it from most other trust establishment schemes (e.g., [Bonatti
and Samarati 2000; Herzberg et al. 2000]) is that credentials themselves are
treated as protected resources.
Prior work on ATN lacks an adequate notion of security. Fundamental ques-
tions such as “what needs to be protected in ATN?” and “what are the security
requirements?” are not adequately answered. The main purpose of this paper is
to answer some of these questions by providing a formal ATN framework with
precise and appropriate security deﬁnitions. Let us illustrate the deﬁciencies
of security deﬁnitions in existing ATN work.
In most ATN frameworks, each negotiator establishes access control (AC)
policies to regulate the disclosure of credentials to negotiation opponents. A typ-
ical description in the literature of the safety requirement for AC-policy-based
ATN is the one given in Yu et al. [2003]: “given a sequence Q = {C1, . . . , Cn} of
disclosures of protected resources, if each Ci is unlocked at the time it is dis-
closed, then we say Q is a safe disclosure sequence.” Here, unlocked means that
the AC policy for the credential is satisﬁed by credentials disclosed previously by
the other party, and a credential is one kind of resource. This deceptively simple
requirement turns out to be far from adequate in ensuring that an ATN sys-
tem protects the privacy of sensitive attributes. Several groups of researchers
have noted [Seamons et al. 2002; Winsborough and Li 2002b; Yu and Winslett
2003a] that although early ATN designs satisfy the safety requirement for AC
policies, they nonetheless fail to adequately protect the privacy of negotiators.
Thus, it is recognized that a problem exists with ATN’s traditional notion of
safety. The problem stems from the fact that the traditional notion is satisﬁed
by ATN designs in which, although a sensitive credential itself is not trans-
mitted until its associated AC policy is satisﬁed, the behavior of a negotiator
reveals a great deal about the contents of these credentials. Indeed, most ATN
designs do just that. When a negotiator is asked to prove a sensitive attribute,
the negotiator’s behavior depends on whether it has the attribute or not. By ob-
serving the negotiator’s behavior, the negotiator’s opponent can infer whether
the negotiator has a sensitive attribute or not. Thus, in the case where simply
having or not having the attribute is private information, while the negotiator’s

opponent may not yet have proof of the authenticity of the attribute, the pri-
vacy of the attribute has certainly been compromised. In Seamons et al. [2002],
some ad hoc solutions are proposed. For example, it is suggested that instead
of transmitting the AC policy, a negotiator having a sensitive attribute could
simply behave as though he did not, and just wait, hoping the opponent will
happen to send enough credentials to satisfy the AC policy.
Trust negotiation is of little value if participants must mislead one another
to protect sensitive information, since this would make many negotiations fail
unnecessarily. Yet most prior negotiation techniques allow a negotiator’s oppo-
nent to gain advantage just in case the negotiator is honest. As we show in this
paper, one of the few existing ATN strategies that is immune from this problem
is the eager strategy [Winsborough et al. 2000]. In it, each party transmits all
credentials whose access control policies have already been satisﬁed, whether
these credentials are related to the eventual negotiation goal or not. In the
eager strategy, when a negotiator does not receive a given credential from the
opponent, it does not know whether this is because the opponent does not have
the credential, or because the negotiator simply has not satisﬁed the opponent’s
AC policy for that credential. However, because the eager strategy does not fo-
cus the exchange on credentials that are relevant to the authorization decision
at hand, it is impractical for many scenarios.
In Winsborough and Li [2002b], an approach was proposed for focusing the
credential exchange while simultaneously protecting sensitive attributes of ne-
gotiators. The approach is based on the notion of an acknowledgement policy
(“ack” policy, for short). An ack policy resembles an AC policy, although it is as-
sociated with an attribute, rather than with a credential proving the attribute.
The key difference from AC policy is that one can associate an ack policy with
an attribute one does not have. This makes it possible to provide the ack policy
without, by doing so, indicating whether one satisﬁes the associated attribute.
Note that it is not possible to provide an AC policy for an attribute without
indicating that one satisﬁes the attribute, because AC policies are established
only for attributes that one satisﬁes. The intuitive goal of ack policies is that no
one should learn through negotiation whether or not a negotiator N possesses
an attribute without ﬁrst satisfying its ack policy. This intuitive notion of safe
enforcement of ack policies was not formalized in previous work using the con-
cept Winsborough and Li [2002a, 2002b]. Therefore, it was impossible to prove
that a given strategy using ack policies is safe.
The present goal is to articulate a suitable deﬁnition of this notion that is
precise, usable, and intuitive. The deﬁnition should be precise and usable so
that one can prove safety of negotiation strategies using the deﬁnition. The def-
inition should also be intuitive in that ATN systems satisfying it should fulﬁll
our expectations that sensitive attributes of the negotiator be protected from
unintended disclosure. This goal is in keeping with the research tradition in
information security and cryptography of ﬁnding security deﬁnitions for nu-
merous problems and protocols that are suitably precise, usable, and intuitive.
The approach we take in this paper is to formalize the following intuition
about safe enforcement of ack policies: unless N’s negotiation opponent sat-
isﬁes the ack policy for a sensitive attribute, N’s behavior in the negotiation

must give no indication of whether N possesses any credentials documenting
the sensitive attribute. As we will see, the details of the safety condition are
somewhat intricate, and simply preventing an adversary from determining spe-
ciﬁc attributes is inadequate. In light of this notion of safety, ack policies are
exactly the sort of policies that are required to enable negotiators to behave
safely while presenting to one another information about interdependencies
among candidate credential disclosures: only by using policies that do not de-
pend signiﬁcantly on his attributes can a negotiator present policy content
governing disclosure of his attributes without leaking information about his
likely attributes.
Accommodating diverse credential systems requires effort. In particular, We
seek a notion of safety that can be supported by systems in which credentials can
represent delegations of authority. Such credential systems support a limited
form of deduction, which means we must prevent safety being breached through
deductive inference. The threat of probabilistic inference also inﬂuences the
selection of an appropriate safety condition.
Let us outline our safety deﬁnition. We ﬁrst formalize the ability of an adver-
sary to distinguish between one negotiator and another. For each negotiator N
and each adversary M , there is a set U of attributes whose ack policies are not
satisﬁed by M . We deﬁne a strategy to be safe if any other negotiator N(cid:3) who
differs from N only in credentials that prove attributes in U is indistinguish-
able from N by M based on ATN. We discuss other deﬁnitions that capture
similar, but different intuitions about safety, showing they are strictly weaker
and inadequate in various respects. Our notions of safety have important sim-
ilarities to the notions of noninterference [Goguen and Meseguer 1982] and
nondeducibility [Sutherland 1986], which we discuss in Section 6.
Although we conclude that AC policies are inadequate for protecting informa-
tion about whether or not a principal has a given attribute, they may nonethe-
less be useful for protecting other information in credentials. For instance, they
may be adequate when having the attribute is not sensitive, but a given at-
tribute value is sensitive. Everyone has a blood type, but one’s particular blood
type might be somewhat sensitive. If a credential containing one’s blood type is
protected by an AC policy, no information is leaked by disclosing that one has
such a credential, so long as the contents of the credential are not revealed.
Thus, we also provide a precise deﬁnition of safe enforcement of AC policies.
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
1. A formal framework for trust negotiation and a precise deﬁnition of safety
for enforcement of ack policies in that framework.
2. Proof that the eager strategy is safe based on this formal deﬁnition.
3. A formal analysis of the relationship between our safety deﬁnition and two
alternative deﬁnitions that also seem intuitive.
4. An analysis that shows why our ﬁrst safety deﬁnition is preferable to the
two alternatives mentioned above.
5. A family of strategies based on the Trust Target Graph (TTG) protocol [Wins-
borough and Li 2002b] that supports ﬂexibility in the search for a successful
negotiation.

6. A proof that all strategies in this family are safe according to the formal
deﬁnition. This validates both the usability of the deﬁnition and the design
of the TTG framework.
7. A precise deﬁnition of safety for AC policies that can be used with crypto-
graphic ATN protocols.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss in
detail why previous notions of safety are inadequate. Section 3 presents contri-
butions 1–4 from the list above; Section 4 reviews the TTG protocol and presents
contributions 5 and 6. In Section 5, we discuss deﬁciencies of previous safety
deﬁnition for AC policies and give our deﬁnition (contribution 7). We discuss
related work in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7. The appendix contains
proofs of theorems.
2. PRIOR UNSATISFACTORY NOTIONS OF SAFETY
Most existing negotiation strategies are safe according to the limited deﬁni-
tions laid out for them by their designers. However, as we show in this section,
they are not safe in the sense of protecting the content of credentials, which
is arguably the central goal of ATN: if credential content did not need protec-
tion, requesters could simply push all their credentials to the access mediator
for evaluation. This leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the deﬁnition of
