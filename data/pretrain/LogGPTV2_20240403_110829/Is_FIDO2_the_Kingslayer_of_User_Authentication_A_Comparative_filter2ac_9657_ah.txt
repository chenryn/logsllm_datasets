CS background = Computer science background; SUS = System Usability Scale.
Depending on the variable, the frequencies or the scale mean values including
standard deviation are presented in the cells. The statistics column shows the
statistical data parameters for a group comparison with one-way anova respectively
with Fisher’s exact test for the corresponding variable. p values below the 5%
criterion are printed in bold. Effect Sizes are speciﬁed in Eta-squared (η2) for one-
way anova and in Cramer’s V for Fisher’s exact test. N(total) = 141.

Note: Robust regression based on MM estimator [69]. Model 3 can explain 47.1%
(R2adjusted = .471) of the empirical variance (adjusted for number of terms in
model); ATI = Afﬁnity for Technology Interaction; PC = Privacy Concerns; CS
(yes) = Dummy variable that encodes the effect of a computer science background
(No background is the default); SUS = System Usability Scale; Group1FA = Dummy
variable that encodes the differences for the groups (GroupPass is the default). Group-
1FAcon = Dummy variable that encodes the differences for the groups (GroupPass is
the default). p-values below the 5% criterion are printed in bold. N(total) = 141.

Note: Res.Df = Residual Degrees of freedom, R2adj. = Percentage of the empirical
variance that could be explained by the regression model (adjusted for number of
terms in model). Model 3 explains the empirical data best under the conditions of
parsimony (Occam’s razor), δdf = differences in the number of constraints between
models, W = Wald statistic, p values below the 5% criterion are printed in bold.
