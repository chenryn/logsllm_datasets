**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
Bug (maybe)
**What is the current behavior?**  
If wrapped in React.StrictMode and a function component contains a call to
`useState`, the function (render) is called twice - even if the state setter
is never called.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**

(please see console)
**What is the expected behavior?**  
I would expect it to only render once.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
16.8.3 in Chrome on macOS Mojave; requires hooks so not tested with previous
versions.
This may be related to #12961 \- but note that nowhere am I setting state
(only initializing it).
If this is expected behavior please feel free to close. Thank you!
