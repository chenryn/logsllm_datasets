User: How to use Git branches to manage different code versions during development?
Assistant: Git branching is a powerful tool that allows developers to maintain multiple versions of the same code base simultaneously, and each version can be developed and modified independently. Here are some basic steps for code version management using Git branches: 1. Create a branch: Use the git branch command to create a new branch, for example git branch new-branch 2. Switch branches: Use the git checkout command to switch to the branch, for example git checkout new-branch 3. Modify on the branch: perform code modification, submission and other operations on the new branch, these operations will not affect the content of other branches. 4. Merge branch: If you want to merge the content of the new branch back into the main branch after the modification, you can use the git merge command to merge the content of the new branch into the main branch. 5. Resolving conflicts: During the process of merging branches, code conflicts may occur, and conflicts need to be resolved manually. 6. Delete the branch: If the modification on the branch has been merged into the main branch, you can use the git branch -d command to delete the branch. Through the above steps, different code versions can be well managed in Git. In order to ensure smooth branch management, branches with descriptive names should be used as much as possible, and clear naming rules should be implemented for branches to simplify the development process and facilitate code management.
