User: Please use the python language to write an automated operation and maintenance script for batch installation of software.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script for installing software in batches: ```python import subprocess # Import the subprocess module for executing commands # Define a dictionary containing software names and their corresponding installation commands software = { "nginx": "apt -get install nginx -y", "mysql": "apt-get install mysql-server -y", "python3": "apt-get install python3 -y", #Add more software and their corresponding installation commands} # Traverse the dictionary and execute the installation commands in sequence for name, command in software.items(): print("Start installation" + name + "...") result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True) if result.returncode == 0: print(name + "Installation succeeded!") else: print(name + "Installation failed: " + result.stderr.decode()) ``` When using it, just copy the required software And its corresponding installation commands are added to the software dictionary, and then these software can be installed automatically by running the script.
