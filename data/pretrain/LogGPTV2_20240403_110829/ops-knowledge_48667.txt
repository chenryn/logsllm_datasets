User: In Python, what is the shortest and the standard way of calling a command through subprocess but not bothering with its output.
I tried subprocess.call however it seems to return the output. I am not bothered with that, I just need to run the program silently without the output cluttering up the screen.
If it helps, I am callling pdflatex and my intention is just to call it.
Assistant: Use the /dev/null if you are using Unix. If you run any command in Shell and don't want to show its output on terminal.
For example :- ls > /dev/null will not produce any output on terminal.
So just use os,subprocess to execute some thing on shell and just put its o/p into /dev/null.
