One is in `impl String` in libcollections/string.rs and has the signature `fn
from_str(string: &str) -> String`.
The other is in `impl FromStr for String` in libstd/from_str.rs and has the
signature `fn from_str(s: &str) -> Option`. In fact,
FromStr::from_str() actually calls String::from_str().
This situation probably came about because `struct String` exists in
libcollections, which you could conceivably have without libstd in a
freestanding environment, and the FromStr trait lives in libstd.
Conceivably, FromStr could be moved to a different crate, or a dependency on
libstd could be introduced to libcollections.
