**ATT&CK ID:** T0830  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)

Adversaries with privileged network access may attempt to modify network traffic in real time through an Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attack. This technique allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate traffic to and from a specific device on the network. Once an AiTM attack is successfully established, the adversary can block, log, modify, or inject data into the communication stream.

Common methods for executing an AiTM attack include:
- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Poisoning:** The attacker sends falsified ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of the target, thereby redirecting traffic through their machine.
- **Proxy Use:** The attacker positions their machine as a proxy between the victim and the intended destination, allowing them to inspect and alter the traffic.

These tactics enable adversaries to gain significant control over network communications, posing a serious threat to the integrity and confidentiality of data.
