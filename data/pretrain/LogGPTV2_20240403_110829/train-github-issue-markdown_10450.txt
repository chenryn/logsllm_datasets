Probably this is by design, but typing such as zone.js, es6-shim and so on are
not referenced anymore. You can easily get around this by installing these
typings yourself, but there seems to be some issues with a `BrowserNodeGlobal`
that is missing and zone.js referencing a es6-promise which if installed will
conflict with es6-shim.
