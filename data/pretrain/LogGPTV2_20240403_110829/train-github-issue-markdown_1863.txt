## Steps to Reproduce
I am learning how to create mobile apps at the moment. I cannot give an in-
depth bug report. I am reporting a bug because similar code does not render.
In lib/views/main.dart, setting the TabBarView seems to fail in one
application but succeed in another. Of course, I can manually create a widget
list and not use a switch and map statements. I wonder if this code is worthy
of a bug report.

Step to repoduce
  1. download weather_app project
  2. Build it
  3. Run it
  4. TabBarView fails and leave a blank page
  5. Error is thrown

Expected Results  
Reproduce the same steps with pregnant watermelon commit
7fbb55828d3b0986fcee559bde351a119803bf1b
The TabBarView renders properly.
I am wondering what am I doing differently between pregnant_watermelon and
weather_app. The code is almost the same but one fails and the other succeeds.
The pages does not matter because I change the page in pregnant_watermelon to
the same all MyHomePage and it succeeded.
Either throw warning sign in pregnant_watermelon or throw a better error in
my_weather app to figure out what is going on.
