## Steps to Reproduce

I am currently learning how to create mobile applications. While I cannot provide an in-depth bug report, I have encountered an issue where similar code does not render correctly in one of my projects.

In `lib/views/main.dart`, the `TabBarView` widget is failing to render in one application but works correctly in another. Although I can manually create a list of widgets and avoid using `switch` and `map` statements, I am unsure if this issue warrants a bug report.

### Working Build
- Repository: [Pregnant Watermelon](https://github.com/hungrymonkey/pregnant_watermelon/tree/567712d47f31e26b53eb6ebc203f73324e404248)
- Main Dart File: [main.dart](https://github.com/hungrymonkey/pregnant_watermelon/blob/567712d47f31e26b53eb6ebc203f73324e404248/lib/main.dart)

### Failed Build
- Repository: [Weather App](https://github.com/hungrymonkey/weather_app/tree/df30be259af667ffd06546eb73795031a5b7a881)
- Main Dart File: [main.dart](https://github.com/hungrymonkey/weather_app/blob/df30be259af667ffd06546eb73795031a5b7a881/lib/main.dart)

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Download the `weather_app` project.
2. Build the project.
3. Run the project.
4. Observe that the `TabBarView` fails to render and leaves a blank page.
5. The following error is thrown:
   ```
   I/flutter (31980): ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   I/flutter (31980): The following assertion was thrown during performLayout():

   I/flutter (31980): In either case, please report this assertion by filing a bug on GitHub:

   ```

### Expected Results
- Reproduce the same steps with the `pregnant_watermelon` commit `7fbb55828d3b0986fcee559bde351a119803bf1b`.
- The `TabBarView` renders properly.

### Observations
- I am unsure what the difference is between the `pregnant_watermelon` and `weather_app` projects. The code is almost identical, yet one fails while the other succeeds.
- The specific pages used do not seem to matter, as I replaced the pages in `pregnant_watermelon` with the same `MyHomePage` and it still succeeded.
- It would be helpful if `pregnant_watermelon` threw a warning or if `weather_app` provided a more informative error message to help diagnose the issue.

## Logs
- Run your application with `flutter run` and attach all the log output.
- Run `flutter analyze` and attach any output of that command also.
