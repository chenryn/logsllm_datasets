User: In my app i sent packet by raw socket to another computer than get packet back and write the return packet to another computer by raw socket. 
My app is c++ application run on Ubuntu work with nfqueue.
I want to test sent packets for both computer1 and computer2 in order to check if they are as expected.
I need to write an automation test that check my program, this automation test need to listen to the eth load the sent packets and check if they are as expected (ip,ports, payload).
I am looking for a simple way (tool (with simple API), code) to do this.
I need a simple way to listen (automate) to the eth .
I preffer that the test will check the sender , but it might be difficult to find an api to listen the eth (i sent via raw socket) , so a suggested API that will check the receivers computers is also good.
The test application can be written in c++, java , python.
Assistant: The only way to check if a packet has been sent correctly is by verifying it's integrity on the receiving end.
