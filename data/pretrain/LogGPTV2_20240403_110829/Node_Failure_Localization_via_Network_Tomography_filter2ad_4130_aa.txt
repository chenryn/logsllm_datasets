Abstract
We investigate the problem of localizing node failures in
a communication network from end-to-end path measure-
ments, under the assumption that a path behaves normally if
and only if it does not contain any failed nodes. To uniquely
localize node failures, the measurement paths must show dif-
ferent symptoms under diﬀerent failure events, i.e., for any
two distinct sets of failed nodes, there must be a measure-
ment path traversing one and only one of them. This condi-
tion is, however, impractical to test for large networks. Our
ﬁrst contribution is a characterization of this condition in
terms of easily veriﬁable conditions on the network topol-
ogy with given monitor placements under three families of
probing mechanisms, which diﬀer in whether measurement
paths are (i) arbitrarily controllable, (ii) controllable but
cycle-free, or (iii) uncontrollable (i.e., determined by the de-
fault routing protocol). Our second contribution is a char-
acterization of the maximum identiﬁability of node failures,
measured by the maximum number of simultaneous failures
that can always be uniquely localized. Speciﬁcally, we bound
the maximal identiﬁability from both the upper and the
lower bounds which diﬀer by at most one, and show that
these bounds can be evaluated in polynomial time. Finally,
we quantify the impact of the probing mechanism on the
capability of node failure localization under diﬀerent prob-
ing mechanisms on both random and real network topolo-
gies. We observe that despite a higher implementation cost,
probing along controllable paths can signiﬁcantly improve a
network’s capability to localize simultaneous node failures.

INTRODUCTION
Eﬀective monitoring of network performance is essential
for network operators in building a reliable communication
network that is robust against service disruptions. In order
to achieve this goal, the monitoring infrastructure must be
able to detect network misbehaviors (e.g., unusually high
loss/latency, unreachability) and localize the sources of the
anomaly (e.g., malfunction of certain routers) in an accu-
rate and timely manner. Knowledge of where problematic
network elements reside in the network is particularly use-
ful for fast service recovery, e.g., the network operator can
migrate aﬀected services and/or reroute traﬃc. However,
localizing network elements that cause a service disruption
can be challenging. The straightforward approach of directly
monitoring the health of individual elements is not always
feasible due to traﬃc overhead, access control, or lack of pro-
tocol support at internal nodes. Moreover, built-in monitor-
ing agents running on network elements cannot detect prob-
lems caused by misconﬁgured/unanticipated interactions be-
tween network layers, where end-to-end communication is
disrupted but individual network elements along the path
remain functional (a.k.a.
silent failures) [1]. These limi-
tations call for a diﬀerent approach that can diagnose the
health of network elements from the health of end-to-end
communications perceived between measurement points.
This diﬀerent approach is generally known as network to-
mography [2], where a canonical application is inferring in-
ternal network characteristics by measuring end-to-end per-
formance from a subset of nodes with monitoring capabil-
ities, referred to as monitors. Unlike direct measurement,
network tomography only relies on end-to-end performance
(e.g., path connectivity) experienced by data packets, thus
addressing issues such as overhead, lack of protocol support,
and silent failures. In cases where the network characteristic
of interest is binary (e.g., normal or failed ), the problem is
known as Boolean network tomography [3].
195In this paper, we study an application of Boolean network
tomography to localize node failures from measurements of
path states. Assuming that a measurement path is normal
if and only if all nodes on this path behave normally, we
formulate the problem as a system of Boolean equations,
where the unknown variables are the binary node states,
and the known constants are the observed states of mea-
surement paths. The goal of Boolean network tomography
is essentially to solve this system of Boolean equations.
Because the observations are coarse-grained (path nor-
mal/failed), it is usually impossible to uniquely identify node
states from path measurements. For example, if two nodes
always appear together in measurement paths, then upon
observing failures of all these paths, we can at most deduce
that one of these nodes (or both) has failed but cannot de-
termine which one. Observing that there are often multiple
explanations for given path failures, existing work mostly
focuses on ﬁnding the most probable explanation that in-
volves the minimum set of failed nodes. There is, however,
no guarantee that nodes in this minimum set have failed or
that nodes outside the set have not. Generally, to distin-
guish between two possible failure sets, there must exist a
measurement path that traverses one and only one of these
two sets. There is, however, a lack of understanding of what
this requires in terms of observable network settings such as
topology, monitor placement, and measurement routing.
In this paper, we consider two closely related problems:
In a network with any given monitor placement, (1) if the
number of simultaneous node failures is bounded by k, then
under what conditions can one uniquely localize failed nodes
from path measurements? (2) what is the maximum num-
ber of simultaneous node failures (i.e., the largest value
of k) that can be uniquely localized in this network? We
study both problems in the context of the following fami-
lies of probing mechanisms: (i) Controllable Arbitrary-path
Probing (CAP), where measurement paths are arbitrarily
controllable, (ii) Controllable Simple-path Probing (CSP),
where measurement paths are controllable but cycle-free,
and (iii) Uncontrollable Probing (UP), where measurement
paths are determined by the default routing protocol. These
probing mechanisms assume diﬀerent levels of control over
the routing of probing packets and are feasible in diﬀerent
network scenarios (see Section 2.3); answers to the above
two problems under these probing mechanisms thus provide
insights on how the level of control bestowed on the moni-
toring system aﬀects its capability in failure localization.
In the sequel, we assume that node failures are persistent,
i.e., a failed node remains failed throughout the measure-
ment process and leads to failures of all paths traversing it.
1.1 Related Work
Based on the number of simultaneously failed elements,
existing work can be broadly classiﬁed into single failure
localization and multiple failure localization. Single failure
localization assumes that multiple simultaneous failures hap-
pen with negligible probability. Under this assumption, [4,5]
propose eﬃcient algorithms for monitor placement such that
any single failure can be detected and localized. To improve
the resolution in characterizing failures, range tomography
in [6] not only localizes the failure, but also estimates its
severity (e.g., congestion level). These works, however, ig-
nore the fact that multiple failures occur more frequently
than one may imagine [7]. In this paper, we consider the
general case of localizing multiple failures.
Multiple failure localization often faces inherent uncer-
tainty in the number of failures. Most existing works ad-
dress this uncertainty by attempting to ﬁnd the minimum
set of network elements whose failures can explain the ob-
served path states. Under the assumption that failures are
low-probability events, this approach generates the most
probable failure set among all possibilities. Using this ap-
proach, [8,9] propose solutions for networks with tree topolo-
gies, which are later extended to general topologies by [1].
Similarly, [11] proposes to localize link failures by mini-
mizing false positives; however, it cannot guarantee unique
failure localization.
In a Bayesian formulation, [12] pro-
poses a two-staged solution which ﬁrst estimates the failure
(loss rate above threshold) probabilities of diﬀerent links
and then infers the most likely failure set for subsequent
measurements. Augmenting path measurements with (par-
tially) available control plane information (e.g., routing mes-
sages), [13,14] propose a greedy heuristic for troubleshooting
network unreachability in multi-AS (Autonomous System)
networks that has better accuracy than benchmarks using
only path measurements.
Little is known when we insist on uniquely localizing net-
work failures. Given a set of monitors known to uniquely
localize failures on paths between themselves, [15] develops
an algorithm to remove redundant monitors such that all
failures remain identiﬁable. If the number of failed links is
upper bounded by k and the monitors can probe arbitrary
cycles or paths containing cycles, [16] proves that the net-
work must be (k + 2)-edge-connected to identify any failures
up to k links using one monitor, which is then used to derive
requirements on monitor placement for general topologies.
However, the condition remains unknown if the failures are
associated with nodes instead of links, or constraints (e.g.,
cycle-free) are imposed on measurement paths by the rout-
ing protocols (see discussions in Section 4.1 for why the re-
sults of [16] do not apply to our problem). In this paper,
we investigate the fundamental relationships between node
failure identiﬁability and explicit network settings such as
topology, placement of monitors, and probing mechanism,
with focus on developing eﬃcient algorithms to characterize
the capability of failure localization under given settings.
1.2 Summary of Contributions
We study, for the ﬁrst time, the fundamental capability
of a network with arbitrarily given monitor placements to
uniquely localize node failures from binary end-to-end mea-
surements between monitors. Our contributions are ﬁve-
fold:
1) We propose a novel measure, referred to as maximum
identiﬁability, to characterize a network’s capability in fail-
ure localization as the maximum number of simultaneous
node failures it can uniquely localize.
2) We establish abstract necessary/suﬃcient conditions
for uniquely localizing a bounded number of failures, which
are applicable to all probing mechanisms.
3) We translate the abstract conditions into more concrete
conditions in terms of network topology, placement of mon-
itors, and measurement paths under three diﬀerent probing
mechanisms (CAP, CSP, and UP), which can be tested in
polynomial time.
4) We show that a special relationship between the above
necessary/suﬃcient conditions leads to tight upper and lower
bounds on the maximum identiﬁability that narrows its value
to at most two consecutive integers. The bounds are polynomial-

time computable under CAP and CSP; while they are NP-
hard to compute under UP, we give a greedy heuristic to
compute a pair of relaxed bounds that frequently coincide
with the original bounds in practice.
5) We extensively compare the maximum identiﬁability
under diﬀerent probing mechanisms on random and real
topologies. Our comparison shows that although control-
lable probing, especially CAP, is more diﬃcult to implement,
it signiﬁcantly improves the capability of failure localization
in terms of maximum identiﬁability.
Note that the proposed model captures network state at a
small time scale (time for conducting probing) and all above
results are valid as long as node failures are persistent dur-
ing probing. Moreover, we have limited our observations to
binary states (normal/failed) of measurement paths.
It is
possible in some networks to obtain extra information from
probes, e.g., rerouted paths after a default path fails, in
which case our solution provides lower bounds on the max-
imum identiﬁability. Furthermore, we do not make any as-
sumption on the distribution or correlation of node failures
across the network. In some application scenarios (e.g., dat-
acenter networks), failures of some nodes may be correlated
(e.g., all routers sharing the same power/chiller). We leave
the characterization of maximum identiﬁability in the pres-
ence of such additional information to future work.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
formulates the problem. Section 3 presents abstract condi-
tions for identifying node failures, followed by concrete, veri-
ﬁable conditions for speciﬁc families of probing mechanisms
in Section 4. Based on the derived conditions, Section 5
presents bounds on the maximum identiﬁability that can be
eﬃciently evaluated. The bounds are evaluated on various
synthetic/real topologies in Section 6 to study the impact
of the probing mechanism on the capability of node failure
localization. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
2. PROBLEM FORMULATION
2.1 Models and Assumptions
We assume that the network topology is known and can
be modeled as an undirected graph1 G = (V, L), where V
In G, the number
and L are the sets of nodes and links.
of neighbors of node v is called the degree of v. Note that
graph G can represent a logical topology where each node
in G corresponds to a physical subnetwork. Without loss of
generality, we assume G is connected, as diﬀerent connected
components have to be monitored separately.
A subset of nodes M (M ⊆ V ) are monitors that can ini-
tiate and collect measurements. The rest of the nodes, de-
noted by N := V \ M , are non-monitors. Let µ := |M | and
σ := |N | denote the numbers of monitors and non-monitors.
We assume that monitors do not fail during the measure-
ment process, as failed monitors can be directly detected and
ﬁltered out within the monitoring system. Non-monitors, on
the other hand, may fail, and a failure event may involve si-
multaneous failures of multiple non-monitors. Depending on
the adopted probing mechanism, monitors can measure and
determine the states of nodes by sending probes along cer-
tain paths. Let P denote the set of all possible measurement
paths under a given probing mechanism; for given G and
M , diﬀerent probing mechanisms can lead to diﬀerent sets
of measurement paths, which will be speciﬁed later. We use
node state (path state) to refer to the state, failed or normal,
of nodes (paths), where a path fails if and only if at least
one node on the path fails. To avoid trivial cases, we assume
that each non-monitor is traversed by at least one measure-
ment path, as otherwise the non-monitor is unobservable to
the monitoring system and has to be excluded in failure lo-
calization. Table 1 summarizes graph-related notations used
in this paper (following the convention of [10]).
Let w = (W1, . . . , Wσ)T be the binary column vector of
the states of all non-monitors and c = (C1, . . . , Cγ)T the
binary column vector of the states of all measurement paths.
For both node and path states, 0 represents “normal” and
1 represents “failed”. We can relate the path states to the
node states through the following Boolean linear system:
R ⊙ w = c,
(1)
where R = (Rij) is a γ × σ measurement matrix , with
each entry Rij ∈ {0, 1} denoting whether non-monitor vj is
present on path Pi (1: yes, 0: no), and “⊙” is the Boolean
matrix product, i.e., Ci = ∨σ
j=1(Rij ∧ Wj). The goal of
