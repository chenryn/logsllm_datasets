linear improvements, however, might not be a compelling moti-
vation for low-power designs. So we demonstrate next that multi-
antenna cancellation can provide orders of magnitude communica-
tion rate improvements for ambient backscatter systems [24]. Am-
bient backscatter enables two battery-free devices, Alice and Bob,
to communicate with each other by backscattering ambient signals
in the environment (e.g., TV transmissions). This is in contrast to
traditional backscatter systems (e.g., RFID), where the communi-
cation is between a battery-free tag and a powered RFID reader and
works only in the presence of an RFID reader.
At a high level, the backscattering device encodes a ‘1’ bit by
reﬂecting the incident ambient signals and a ‘0’ bit by absorbing
them. The challenge in achieving this is that the ambient signals
(e.g., TV) carry information and hence change signiﬁcantly with
time. Prior designs [24] average out the fast-changing TV trans-
missions to decode the backscattered signals. Averaging removes
the variations inherent to the ambient signals, thus allowing the re-
ceiver to decode the backscattered signals.
The key issue with averaging, however, is that the backscatter-
ing device can transmit information only at a rate that is lower than
that of the averaging. Speciﬁcally, if the receiver averages the TV
transmissions over 100 ms, then the backscattering device can only
transmit at a maximum rate of 10 bps. Similarly, if the receiver
averages transmissions over one millisecond, then the maximum
backscatter rate is 1 kbps. Since averaging must be done over a
signiﬁcant period of time to smooth out the variation in the TV
transmissions, averaging does not allow rates much higher than
10 kbps [24]. Intuitively, this is because existing designs decode
the backscattered information by considering the ambient signals
(e.g., TV) as noise. Since the strength of the TV signal is signiﬁ-
cantly higher than that of the backscattering signal, the channel has
a very low SNR and hence achieves a very low communication rate.
Using multiple antennas, one can eliminate interference from TV
signals, and hence provide orders of magnitude higher bit rates.1 To
see this, consider the 2-antenna receiver in Fig. 2. Suppose s(t) is
the signal transmitted by an ambient RF source (e.g., TV tower) and
that the backscattering device conveys a one bit by reﬂecting the
TV signals and a zero bit by not reﬂecting them. Now, the receiver
1Note that we aim to use multiple antennas for interference can-
cellation rather than leverage them for antenna diversity. This is
because while antenna diversity can reduce the amount of averag-
ing required (e.g., halve it with a two antenna system) it does not
eliminate the interference from TV signals.
receives the following signals on its two antennas.
y1(t) = hrf s(t) + hbB(t)s(t)
y2(t) = h′

rf s(t) + h′

where hrf , h′
b are the channels from the RF source (TV
tower) and the backscattering device respectively. In principle, if
the receiver can estimate the channel parameters, hrf , h′
rf and hb, h′
b,
it would have two equations in two unknowns, s(t) and B(t); thus
it can decode the backscattered information, B(t) by performing a
matrix inversion operation on the received signals.
Achieving the above operations on a backscatter device, how-
ever, is challenging for two main reasons:
• Channel estimation requires computing both the amplitude and
phase on the receiver. Estimating the phase information requires
the use of a local oscillator; an oscillator must operate at the car-
rier frequency, therefore consuming more power than is avail-
able. Thus backscatter devices do not have the phase information
required to perform channel estimation.
• Decoding the backscattered signal is done by performing matrix
inversion on a digital representation of the received signal. Digi-
tizing the analog signals requires an 8-12 bit resolution ADC that
operates at the communication rate; this again consumes more
power than is available on a backscatter device.
4.2 µmo Decoding Algorithm
µmo can decode backscatter signals with neither phase informa-
tion nor ADCs. In this section, we describe our algorithm to decode
the backscatter signal without estimating the channel parameters. In
the next section, we show how the algorithm can be achieved using
only analog computation.
Our intuition is as follows: Since backscattering creates an addi-
tional reﬂection to the receiver, the effect of backscatter is to change
the channel at the receiver. Further, since the reﬂected signal prop-
agates by different distances to the two antennas at the receiver, the
channel changes created on the two antennas are different. Thus,
by comparing the relative channel changes across the two antennas,
we can identify the bits transmitted by the backscattering device.
More formally, µmo ﬁrst computes the amplitude of the received
signal on the two antennas to get:
|y1(t)| = |hrf s(t) + hbB(t)s(t)|
|y2(t)| = |h′
bB(t)s(t)|
rf s(t) + h′
where |a| represents the magnitude of a. Dividing the above equa-
tions, we have the following fraction:
|y1(t)|
|y2(t)|
=
|hrf + hbB(t)|
|h′
bB(t)|
rf + h′
Note that the above fraction is independent of the TV signal s(t),
and hence is not affected by the envelope ﬂuctuations inherent in
TV transmissions. Now, since the backscattered bits B(t) are either
‘1’ or ‘0’, the above fraction gives us either
. Thus,
|hrf |
rf | or
|h′
|hrf +hb|
h′
rf +h′
b
the above fraction computation results in two different levels de-
pending on whether the backscattered bit is a zero or a one.
To see the above computation in practice, we use a backscatter
device to transmit an alternating sequence of zeros and ones at a rate
of 1 kbps, by backscattering 539 MHz TV transmissions. We use a
USRP equipped with two antennas separated by half a wavelength
to capture the received digital signals from a distance of 3 feet.
Fig. 3 (a) and (b) plot the received signal on each of the receive an-
tennas. The ﬁgures show that it is difﬁcult to see the backscattered
signal in the presence of the TV transmissions. Fig. 3 (c) plots the
result of dividing the received signals on the two antennas. The plot
shows that now the alternating sequence of backscattered bits is
visible, allowing the receiver to decode.
We note the following key points:
• The above computation does not guarantee that the output cor-
responding to a ‘1’ bit is always greater than that corresponding
to a ‘0’ bit. In particular, the ratio of the amplitudes on the two
antennas depends on hrf , h′
b, which change with de-
vice positions. To address this ambiguity, the receiver uses the
preamble bits sent by the transmitter to extract the mapping.
rf , hb, and h′
• We note that while noise increases the BER at the receiver, it
does not affect the correctness of the above equations. Further, in
the above discussion, we assume that the channel is determined
by a single channel parameter; since backscattering devices do
not use oscillators, they are not frequency selective in their be-
havior. Thus it is reasonable to approximate the channel at the
backscatter device as a single parameter.
4.3 µmo’s Hardware Design
Next, we describe how µmo achieves the above algorithm us-
ing only simple analog components, thus eliminating the need for
power-consuming components such as ADCs.
The µmo receiver has three main stages: 1) an envelope detection
circuit that computes the amplitude of the received signal on each
antenna, 2) an analog circuit that imitates the division operation to
ﬁnd the ratio of the signal envelopes received by the two antennas,
and 3) a thresholding circuit that extracts the backscattered bits. We
explain each of these components in detail.
1) Envelope Detection Circuit. The role of the envelope detector is
to track the envelope of the received signal, while eliminating the
carrier frequency (539 MHz in case of TV transmissions). The cir-
cuit in the ﬁgure uses passive components such as resistors, capaci-
tors, and diodes and hence is ultra-low power in nature. The operat-
ing principle behind an envelope detector is similar to that used in
an RFID tag: diodes act as switches that allow current to ﬂow in the
forward direction but not the reverse, capacitors are charge-storage
elements and resistors regulate current ﬂow. By choosing the ap-
propriate values for these analog components, we can remove the
carrier frequency (e.g., 539 MHz) and leave only the amplitude of
the signal. As shown in Fig. 4, µmo performs the envelope detec-
tion computation on both the receiver antennas.
2) Divider Circuit. The next step is to divide the amplitudes re-
ceived on the two antennas. Performing division in a low-power
manner is not straightforward, particularly since analog dividers are
not a commonly implemented primitive on low power devices. µmo
employs simple logarithmic identities to split the division operation
into several easily implemented steps, using the following mathe-
matical trick:
= elog( a
b ) = e(log(a)−log(b))
a
b
Speciﬁcally, to compute the quotient of two numbers a and b we
can transform them into the logarithmic domain, subtract the two,
and then exponentiate to get the result of the computation. µmo im-
itates the above math in the analog domain to perform division. In
particular, µmo uses a log-ampliﬁer on each of the receive signal
envelopes to transform the signal amplitudes into the logarithmic
domain. At a high level, log-ampliﬁers make use of the non-linear
current-voltage (IV) relationship of a diode to convert a linear do-
main signal to a logarithmic representation. We then use an analog
subtractor to compute the difference between the log-scale signal
amplitudes on the two antennas. To get a true linear ratio signal,
this difference would need to be transformed back into the linear

the division between the received signals on the two antennas, reveals the backscattered bits.
domain using an exponential ampliﬁer (which would also make use
of diode properties). However, because our next step is to perform
a simple thresholding operation on the signal, we can make use of
the fact that the log operation is monotonic and omit the exponen-
tial ampliﬁer. Omitting this ampliﬁer saves power by reducing the
active component count, and does not impact the performance of
the system as the simple thresholding operation is not impacted by
the use of log domain signals.
3) Thresholding Circuit. The goal of this circuit is to distinguish
between the two voltage levels at the output of the divider circuit.
At a high level, the threshold circuit computes the mean of the two
voltage levels, and outputs a one bit when the input is greater than
the threshold and a zero bit otherwise. To compute this mean value,
µmo uses an envelope detector as before. We use speciﬁc values for
the resistors and the capacitors to compute the mean of the signal
envelope. We then use a low-power comparator that outputs a one
bit when the divider output is greater than the mean and a zero bit
otherwise. As described in §4.2, the receiver uses a known pream-
ble in the packet to ﬂip the bits, if necessary, before decoding.
We note that the power consumption of analog components such
as log-ampliﬁers and comparators depends on the bandwidth at
which we would like our analog circuit to operate. The bandwidth
of the analog circuit is deﬁned as the maximum frequency that the
circuit can process without severely attenuating the signals. In our
case, we can set the analog bandwidth by selecting low-power am-
pliﬁer and comparator components that can support a certain band-
width. In our implementation, we build two different prototypes,
one that operates at an analog bandwidth of 1 MHz and the other at
an analog bandwidth of 1 kHz.
4.4 Putting Things Together
The discussion so far focuses on the physical layer of the µmo
receiver. The backscatter transmitter uses the same physical layer
as RFID systems to transmit messages with preambles and CRC
checks. The transmitter can vary the transmitted bit duration and
therefore the data rate. The receiver uses the low-power hardware
design described above to decode messages, which are then vali-
dated by checking the CRC. The transmitter and the receiver use
the same link layer mechanisms (including modulation and bit en-
coding) as prior backscatter systems. To conserve power, µmo’s
transmit hardware sends an alternating bit sequence long enough (8
bits in our implementation) to wake up the receiver’s digital logic
system, which then detects bit boundaries and performs framing.
5.1 Motivation and Challenges
RFID systems have seen a limited adoption, mainly due to lim-
ited read range and the resulting requirement for a dense deploy-
ment of RFID readers to communicate with RFID tags. If we
can enable the RFID tags to communicate with each other at
long ranges, we can signiﬁcantly extend the effective read range
by creating a multi-hop network across the RFID tags. Another
backscatter technology that is currently limited by range is am-
bient backscatter [24], which eliminates the need for RFID read-
ers by backscattering ubiquitous ambient signals like TV transmis-
sions. While ambient backscatter does achieve tag-to-tag communi-
cation, the communication range of existing work is limited to two
feet, which signiﬁcantly limits its applicability. Thus, increasing the
range of backscatter communication is essential to improving the
viability of these systems.
Coding mechanisms such as CDMA can in principle be used to
increase the communication range of backscatter systems. These
techniques use a string of pseudorandom bits called chips to en-
code information bits. For example, the transmitter could represent
a zero bit by the chip sequence ‘101110111’ and a one bit by the
chip sequence ‘111011011’. The 1s and 0s in the above sequences
are the chips used by the transmitter to encode the information.
To decode these information bits, the receiver correlates the re-
ceived signal with the chip sequence patterns and converts corre-
