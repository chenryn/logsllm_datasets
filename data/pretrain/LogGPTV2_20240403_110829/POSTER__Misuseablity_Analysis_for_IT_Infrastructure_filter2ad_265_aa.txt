ABSTRACT 
Today, organizations have limited resources available to allocate 
to  the  detection  of  complex  cyber-attacks.  In  order  to  optimize 
their  resource  allocation,  organizations  must  conduct  a  thorough 
risk analysis process so as to focus their efforts and resources on 
the protection of the organization’s important assets. In this study 
we  propose  a  framework  that  automatically  and  dynamically 
derives  a  misuseability  score  for  every  IT  component  (e.g.,  PC, 
laptop,  server,  router,  smartphone,  and  user).  The  misuseability 
score encapsulates the potential damage that can be caused to the 
organization when its assets are compromised and misused.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The  vast  number  of  cyber-attacks  facing  organizations  today 
makes their detection a very difficult task. The challenges include: 
the need to analyze the massive amount of data that is collected by 
information  technology  (IT)  infrastructure;  the  highly  advanced 
cyber-attacks  that  are  continuously  becoming  more  and  more 
sophisticated; the fact that attacks can be originated by insiders or 
external  entities;  the  rapid  introduction  of  new  technologies 
integrated  into  the  organization's  infrastructure;  and  the  variety 
and costs of security solutions. 
Because  of  these  challenges  organizations  must  conduct  a 
thorough risk analysis process in order to focus their efforts and 
resources  on  the  protection  of  highly  critical  assets.  In  the  risk 
analysis  process  the  organization  identifies  the  most  important 
assets by a assigning a risk value to an asset; the risk value is a 
function of the asset's value and the likelihood of the threat to be 
realized. This process is time consuming and therefore ignores the 
dynamic nature of the IT infrastructure. Because of the dynamic 
nature of the IT infrastructure the value of assets may change over 
time and will not be reflected by the risk analysis process results. 
In this study we propose a dynamic framework for supporting the 
risk  analysis  process.  This  is  done  by  automatically  and 
dynamically  deriving  a  misuseability  score  for  every  IT 
component (e.g., PC, laptop, server, router, smartphone, and user). 
The  misuseability  score  encapsulates  the  potential  damage  that 
can be caused to the organization when an asset is compromised 
and misused as part of a cyber-attack.

Harel et al. [1] initially addressed this challenge and presented a 
new  concept,  Misuseability  Weight,  which  assigns  a  sensitivity 
score to data, thereby estimating the level of harm that might be 
inflicted upon the organization when the data is leaked. Assigning 
a misuseability weight to a given dataset is strongly related to the 
way  the  data  is  presented  (e.g.,  tabular  data,  structured,  or  free 
text) and is domain-specific. Harel et al. [1] focus on mitigating 
leakage  or  misuse  incidents  of  data  stored  in  databases  (i.e., 
tabular  data)  and  presented  the  M-Score,  a  misuseability  weight 
measure for tabular data. 
Vartanian  and  Shabtai  [2]  proposed  an  extension  of 
the 
misuseability weight concept and specifically focused on textual 
content.  The  main  goal  is  to  define  a  misuseability  measure, 
termed  TM-Score,  for  textual  content.  Using  this  measure  it  is 
possible to estimate the extent of damage that can be caused by an 
insider that is continuously and gradually exposed to documents. 
The  extent  of  damage  is  determined  by  the  amount,  type,  and 
quality of information to which the insider is exposed. 
In  this  study  we  extend  the  misuseability  concept  to  a  full  and 
comprehensive  framework  that  is  able  to  derive  a  misuseabilty 
score for each IT element including personal computers, servers, 
smartphones, databases, routers, switches, and users. 
This  concept  is  depicted  in  Figure  1.  For  each  IT  element  a 
misuseability score is derived. By analyzing the connectivity level 
among the elements it is possible to identify clusters of elements 
that  are  not  only  highly  connected  but  also  have  a  high 
misuseability score as a group and therefore should be carefully 
analyzed and protected.

set  of  IT  elements  that  are  highly  collected  are  grouped

2.  PROPOSED METHOD 
2.1  Misuseablity Score 
The misuseability score is a quantitative measure that is calculated 
for  each  IT  element  based  on  data  collected  from  the  element 
itself  (using  a  dedicated  agent)  or  externally  from  the  network 
traffic. 
It is derived by applying a predefined function on a set of relevant 
parameters that are calculated from the collected data. Thus, given 
1496 
a set of parameters, p1, p2, …, pn that are dynamically computed 
from  the  data  that  is  collected  from  the  IT  element,  the 
misuseability score of the IT element can be computed according 
to the following equation: 
(cid:1839)(cid:3398)(cid:1845)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1870)(cid:1857)(cid:4666)(cid:1857),(cid:1855)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)(cid:3533)(cid:2009)(cid:3036)·(cid:1868)(cid:3036)
(cid:3041)
(cid:3036)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
where (cid:2009)(cid:2869),(cid:2009)(cid:2870),…,(cid:2009)(cid:3041) are constants which define the importance of 
each  parameter.  These  constants  should  be  provided  by  the 
security officer or derived automatically. In the equation c refers 
to  the  specific  context  for  which  the  misuseability  score  is 
computed. For example, the context can be determined by the day 
of  week  and  part  of  day  for  which  the  misuseability  score  is 
derived. 
In this section we present a set of possible misuseability measures. 
Router M-Score (RM-Score) 
A router misuseability score depends on the amount and quality of 
information  that  is  handled  by  the  router  as  well  as  on  the 
activation  of  various  capabilities  of  the  router.  For  example, 
potentially, the more data that is handled by the router the higher 
the  misuseability  score.  Data  that  is  sent  to/from  a  sensitive 
machine (e.g., a machine with a high misuseability score) via the 
router increase the misuseability score of the router. In addition, a 
specific  capability  that  is  activated  on  the  router  (e.g.,  a  VPN, 
VLAN) increases the attractiveness of the router and the potential 
misuseability. In addition, the type and version of the router may 
influence the misuseability score because an old operating system 
or outdated firmware may result in a more vulnerable device. 
Therefore the RM-Score is derived from the following parameters: 
- 
- 
Configuration 
o  Vendor 
o  OS type 
o  OS version 
o  Known vulnerabilities 
o  Activated  functionalities  (e.g.,  segmentation, 
tunneling/encryption, quality of service) 
Purpose 
o  Location (gateway or internal) 
o 
o 
Importance of connecting networks 
Sensitivity level of IP addresses (for example, 
according to the computed misuseability score 
of the IP address) 
-  Activity 
o  Amount of data transmitted 
o  Number of distinct IP addresses 
o 
Percentage of encrypted traffic 
Server M-Score (SM-Score) 
A server misuseability score depends on the volume of activity of 
the  server,  the  number  of  connected  users,  the  type  and 
importance of the services that are provided by the server, and the 
properties of the server such as the open ports, running services 
and the type and version of the operating system. 
Therefore, 
from 
parameters: 
the  SM-Score 
is  derived
