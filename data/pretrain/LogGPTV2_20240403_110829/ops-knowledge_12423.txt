User: Please explain what a DDoS attack is, and provide prevention and countermeasures.
Assistant: DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service Attack) is an attack method that overloads and paralyzes target servers or network resources. This type of attack typically involves the use of many computers or devices (known as a "botnet" or "zombie machine") that are infected and controlled by a hacker, and then send large amounts of traffic simultaneously with the targeted server or resource to prevent it from functioning properly , thereby preventing it from serving legitimate users. Here are steps to prevent and respond to DDoS attacks: Preventive measures: 1. Use firewalls and security software, such as network intrusion prevention systems (IDS) and intrusion detection systems (IPS), to filter traffic and detect attacks early. 2. Keep software and systems updated in a timely manner, including operating systems, anti-virus software and other software, to reduce security vulnerabilities and reduce the formation of attacks. 3. Limit the range of IP addresses that can access the service to prevent unauthorized access. 4. Use technologies such as CDN (Content Delivery Network) and load balancers to help prevent server overload and paralysis caused by large amounts of traffic. Countermeasures: 1. Notify the network operator or DDoS expert team as soon as possible, and ask them to help deal with the attack. 2. Route all traffic to the cloud defense system to filter malicious traffic and forward trusted traffic to the target server. 3. Use counter-attack measures, such as black hole routing and global attack defense. 4. Monitor and record attacks for subsequent investigation and legal prosecution.
