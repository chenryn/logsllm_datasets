User: On a Linux system, how do I find the process with the highest load?
Assistant: You can use the top command to find the process with the highest load. The steps are as follows: 1. Open the terminal and enter the top command. 2. View the load balancing area, and you can see that there are three values, which are the average system load of 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes. Find the process corresponding to the maximum value. 3. Press the "Shift + M" key combination to sort by memory usage and also to find the process with the highest load. (High memory usage does not mean high load, but it may cause some bottlenecks, depending on the specific situation) In addition, if you need more detailed process information, you can use the ps command and grep command to filter and search. For example: ```shell ps aux|grep -v PID|sort -n -k +3|tail ``` This command will list all processes, sort by CPU utilization from small to large, and display the last 10 process.
