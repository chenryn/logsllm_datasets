User: I want to develop some web apps using Google app engine. I had deployed a guest book application which was their in "gooleappengine" folder by changing its ID.and also was successful.This is simple one.But not getting how to develop complex web apps. Can anyone please suggest me any good Tutarial or example codes Or any books to refer.
Assistant: Typically when I end up doing something more than a trivial demo I need a reason.  Figure out something you want to make and stumble through it, learning as you go until it's working.
I'd use the google app engine community as a place to get questions answered, they're pretty good for that.
As a first app, I'd just have a goal that you're working towards and start asking the community "how do I do this...?"
