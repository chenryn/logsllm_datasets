title:blackhat:eu-22 Confidence in Chaos: Strategies for World-Class Security Operations
You've just found out the smart-lights in the cafeteria are connected to your corporate network and can be dimmed from anywhere in the world, the sales team has been spinning up unmanaged AWS accounts to do customer demos, and your organisation engaged full encryption to meet data protection and privacy laws without notifying you. You know you need to accelerate building and adjusting your detection and response capabilities - and you can't risk making mistakes while you identify your priorities. Today's cybersecurity operations centers (SOCs) are under more pressure than ever to adjust defense and detection techniques on-the-fly to address adversaries hiding in the corners of your IT. To help you see clear priorities through your often unpredictable operational world, we've cultivated an actionable strategic roadmap for any size organisation to up their security ops game. This is based on in-depth interviews with dozens of SOC teams in a broad range of environments, and decades of working in different kinds of SOCs ourselves. Attendees will leave this presentation with practical, pragmatic action items to help their SOC to excel at these challenges, and a clear way to customize the SOC priorities for their organisation. At the end, a link will be provided to a freely available, newly released book that discusses all of this in greater detail. (There is a cost to the print-on-demand version, which neither MITRE nor the authors make a profit).
