User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Flush PostgreSQL log files (Close & reopen files) without restarting postgresql? Is it possible to get PostgreSQL to flush it's log files and reopen them, without having to restart? I have tried to send the HUP signal, but that doesn't do it. I accidentally have a large postgres log file, which i have rmed to delete, but postgres still has the file open, so the disk space isn't freed.

I have PostgreSQL 9.5 on Ubuntu Linux 16.04

Assistant: If you don't want your log files be there periodically. You can try cron.

With this commands
crontab -e

Then write 


 # m h  dom mon dow   command
0 6 * * * rm /somewhere/your/postgresql.log


Then save it.

sudo service cron restart

This means your system will remove the log at 6:00 A.M. everyday.
