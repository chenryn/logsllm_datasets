User: How to prevent and repair the security holes when the application is running?
Assistant: The following measures can be taken to prevent and repair the security loopholes when the application is running: 1. Verify the validity of input parameters: When the application receives user input parameters, it needs to perform legal verification to prevent malicious users from entering attack codes. Such as SQL injection, XSS cross-site scripting, etc. 2. Encrypt sensitive data: For sensitive data transmitted or stored in the database, it needs to be encrypted to avoid being stolen and attacked by hackers. 3. Update and maintain system software: The system software and framework on which the application program depends should be updated and maintained in time to avoid system security problems caused by known vulnerabilities. 4. Add access control and authorization mechanisms: For modules involving sensitive data and functions in the application, access control and authorization mechanisms need to be added to prevent unauthorized users from accessing and operating. 5. Install and use security defense software: You can improve system and application security by installing and using security defense software, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software. 6. Vulnerability scanning and auditing of programs: Vulnerability scanning and security auditing of application programs are performed on a regular basis to discover and repair existing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. 7. Comply with secure coding standards: When writing application code, developers need to abide by secure coding standards to avoid common security problems, such as buffer overflows and format string attacks.
