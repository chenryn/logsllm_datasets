become larger for the NLANR data set as m increases. As
compared with the two bounds of Hotz’s triangulation, the
average of the two bounds is less sensitive to the number of
beacon nodes. GNP can estimate distances accurately only
when the number of variables in the optimization problems
is small, i.e, the numbers of the beacon nodes and the coor-
dinate dimension are small. ICS provides accurate estimates
under most cases, regardless of the number of beacon nodes,
the coordinate dimension, and the level of topology complex-
ity. ICS with the partial measurement method reduces the
number of measurements, while its accuracy is not signiﬁ-
cantly degraded when the number of beacon nodes and the
coordinate dimension are large.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a new Coordinate system called
the Internet Coordinate System (ICS). We show that the
principal component analysis (PCA) technique can eﬀec-
tively extract topological information from delay measure-
ments between beacon hosts. Based on PCA, we devise a
transformation method that projects the distance data space
into a new coordinate system of (much) smaller dimensions.
The transformation retains as much topological information
as possible and yet enables end hosts to easily determine
their locations in the coordinate system. We show via ex-
periments using both real measured and synthetic data sets
that ICS can make accurate and robust estimates of net-
work distances between end hosts, regardless of the number
of beacon nodes and the level of network topology complex-
ity. Finally, we also show the number of measurements made
by a host can be reduced without much loss of accuracy.
We have identiﬁed several research avenues. In particu-
lar, we will investigate several clustering algorithms to be
used by the administrative node in the partial measurement
method (M2) so as to facilitate selection of median beacon
nodes. We will also study in whether or not, and to what ex-
tent, placement of beacon nodes has a signiﬁcant impact on
the PCA-derived coordinate system in measuring network
distances.
