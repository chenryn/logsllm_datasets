In the currently online pandas 0.19.2 documentation, I see the following
inconsistency:
  * There is pandas.DataFrame.pivot_table, but also pandas.pivot_table.
  * In the same way, there is pandas.DataFrame.pivot and also pandas.pivot. (BTW., the latter has the dataframe argument missing.)
  * There is pandas.melt, but no pandas.DataFrame.melt.
The global versions of these methods (and probably others) are identical to
the local ones except for an additional DataFrame argument, I think that all
these should only be DataFrame methods. This would e.g. consistently enable
chaining.
So let me suggest that the global versions should be removed, of course after
a deprecation period.
