##### Description of the problem
I'm using computeVertexNormals on mesh from OBJ and VRML Loader in order to
have a smooth shading applied.
It works with VRML Loader but it don't using OBJ Loader with exactly the same
mesh.
You can see how normal looks like in the 2 cases :

normals](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7044986/13814266/dca8b634-eb85-11e5-8e8e-b89462cc51a2.png)

VRML is smooth shaded and normals (even if inside the mesh) are mingled for
one given vertex.  
OBJ mesh normals are diverging for one given vertex and consequently mesh is
not smooth shaded.
The question is ... why ?
One difference I have noticed is loaded mesh use geometry in VRML case and
BufferGeometry in OBJ case.
Thanks in advance for answers
