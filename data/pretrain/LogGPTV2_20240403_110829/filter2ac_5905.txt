**ATT&CK ID:** M1048  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application Isolation and Sandboxing

**Description:**
Implementing sandboxing can make it more difficult for adversaries to exploit undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities, thereby hindering their ability to advance their operations. Additionally, other forms of virtualization and application microsegmentation can help mitigate the impact of certain types of exploitation. However, it is important to note that these measures may still be susceptible to additional exploits and weaknesses. [3]
