### Issue with HTTPS Configuration

Approximately 3% of the websites we analyzed exhibit an issue related to improper HTTPS configuration. For some of these websites, the root cause is the incorrect setup of HTTPS. For instance, a website that accepts donations for payment does not correctly configure HTTPS and instead uses a default certificate (see Figure 4 in the Appendix). In other cases, while the payment process is secured via HTTPS, other sensitive content, such as items and the shopping cart, is still transmitted over HTTP. This misconfiguration can lead to the presentation of a default, expired certificate (see Figure 5 in the Appendix).

### Comparison with Existing Tools

To evaluate PciCheckerLite, we conducted an experimental comparison with a state-of-the-art web scanner, w3af. Notably, existing scanners often include aggressive penetration testing components that are unsuitable for live websites. For this experiment, we modified w3af to create a "non-intrusive, low-interactive" version. Specifically, we adapted w3af to:
1. Block intrusive tests (e.g., XSS, SQL injections).
2. Disable URL fuzzing.
3. Disable liveliness testing.

For scalability, we also utilized w3afâ€™s programmable APIs (w3af_console) to eliminate the graphical user interface. We refer to this modified version as "customized w3af."

We ran both PciCheckerLite and the customized w3af on 100 randomly selected websites from our dataset of 1,203 sites (see Table 5). Additionally, we tested both tools on our BuggyCart testbed.

### Results

The results are summarized in Table 6. Our findings indicate that PciCheckerLite outperformed w3af on the BuggyCart testbed by detecting all vulnerabilities. On the 100 real-world websites, PciCheckerLite also detected more truly vulnerable sites. Although w3af flagged more websites, manual analysis revealed that a significant portion of these alerts were false positives.

For example:
- **Test Case 7**: w3af flags a website if Port 80 is open, while PciCheckerLite only reports a website if the request is not automatically redirected to Port 443 (HTTPS). This design in w3af resulted in 17 false positives.
- **Test Case 15**: w3af flags a website that uses a certificate for its subdomains, which is not a violation.
- **Test Case 29**: w3af flags websites that expose non-critical information, whereas PciCheckerLite only flags the exposure of exploitable information (e.g., server and framework version numbers).

Among all vulnerabilities, PciCheckerLite had only one false positive under Test Case 25. This was due to a website loading JavaScript from a third-party domain without an integrity check. Manual analysis confirmed that the third-party domain and the original website are owned by the same organization, a detail beyond PciCheckerLite's detection capabilities.

### Responsible Disclosure and Discussion

We have fully disclosed our findings to the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). In May 2019, we shared our paper with the PCI SSC and engaged in productive exchanges with an experienced member of the Security Council. Key insights gained include:
- The Security Council shared our paper with companies hosting PCI certification testbeds, ensuring they are aware of our findings.
- Preventing scanners from gaming the test is a priority, achieved through constant updates and changes to the testbeds.
- Low-interaction constraints make it challenging to test some vulnerabilities externally, a challenge we aimed to address.
- The Security Council routinely removes or warns scanners based on feedback from ASV consumers.
- Their testbeds exclude vulnerabilities with CVSS scores below 4.
- Payment brands and acquirer banks require efficient, automated solutions for inspecting PCI DSS compliance reports.

These insights present interesting research opportunities. Additionally, we are in the process of contacting vulnerable websites. Some notifications have been sent to those failing specific test cases, such as open MySQL ports (Test Case 2) or vulnerable OpenSSH (Test Case 19). Notably, some websites, like Netflix, have already addressed their issues, upgrading from SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 to a more secure version.
