### How to Debug "Multiple Widgets Used the Same GlobalKey" in Flutter

#### Issue Description
You are encountering an error message: "Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey." This error occurs when two or more widgets in your Flutter application share the same `GlobalKey`, which is not allowed. Additionally, you are seeing repeated messages about a child with id 134 being invisible and should not be added to the tree.

#### Console Output
When you press 'W' in the console, the following logs are displayed:

```
Another exception was thrown: Child with id 134 is invisible and should not be added to the tree.
Another exception was thrown: Child with id 134 is invisible and should not be added to the tree.
Another exception was thrown: Child with id 134 is invisible and should not be added to the tree.
Another exception was thrown: Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey.
Another exception was thrown: Duplicate GlobalKey detected in widget tree.
```

These logs indicate that there is a problem with the widget tree, specifically with the `GlobalKey` and an invisible child widget.

#### Steps to Debug

1. **Identify the Duplicated `GlobalKey`**:
   - Search for all instances of `GlobalKey` in your codebase.
   - Ensure that each `GlobalKey` is unique. You can create a new `GlobalKey` instance for each widget that requires it.

2. **Check Widget Visibility**:
   - The log indicates that a child with id 134 is invisible and should not be added to the tree. Verify the visibility of this widget.
   - Ensure that the widget is not being hidden by a parent widget's properties (e.g., `Visibility` widget, `Opacity` widget, or conditional rendering).

3. **Review Widget Tree Structure**:
   - Examine the structure of your widget tree to ensure that no widget is being added multiple times.
   - Use the `debugPrint` function to log the state and lifecycle methods of the widgets to trace their creation and addition to the tree.

4. **Use Flutter DevTools**:
   - Run your app in debug mode and use Flutter DevTools to inspect the widget tree.
   - Look for any duplicate keys or unexpected widget states.

#### Example Code Fix

```dart
// Before
final myKey = GlobalKey<MyWidgetState>();
MyWidget(key: myKey);
MyWidget(key: myKey); // This will cause the error

// After
final myKey1 = GlobalKey<MyWidgetState>();
final myKey2 = GlobalKey<MyWidgetState>();
MyWidget(key: myKey1);
MyWidget(key: myKey2); // Each widget now has a unique key
```

#### Flutter Doctor Output

Your `flutter doctor` output shows that your development environment is set up correctly. Here is the relevant information:

- **Flutter**: Version on Mac OS X 10.13.2, channel master, Framework revision `598c042`.
- **Android Toolchain**: Android SDK 26.0.3, Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment 1.8.0_152.
- **iOS Toolchain**: Xcode 9.2, CocoaPods version 1.3.1.
- **IDEs**: Android Studio 3.0, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2017.3 with Flutter and Dart plugins.

If you continue to experience issues, consider updating your Flutter and Dart SDKs to the latest stable versions.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey" error and the related issues with invisible child widgets.
