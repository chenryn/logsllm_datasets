### Bandwidth and Security in Anonymous Communication Systems

#### sMIX Protocol Overview
- **Bandwidth Usage**: Each user \( U_i \) transmits their communication mixed with scrambling data on their designated upload channel \( C_i \), and only scrambling data on the other channels. Non-transmitting users send scrambling data on all channels.
- **Server Operation**: The server XORs all the users' sets of \( 2m \) channels into a single set of \( 2m \) channels. The scrambling data cancels out, leaving the unscrambled transmissions from the \( 2m \) active communications.
- **Security**: The only information that can be obtained is \( m \), the number of active communications. It is not possible to determine if a specific user is communicating unless all other users betray them.

**Bandwidth Requirements**:
- Users must have \( 2m \) upload channels, using \( 2m \times 10 \) Kbits/s of their upload bandwidth.
- Download bandwidth is reduced compared to the \( n \times 10 \) Kbits/s of bMIX, as typically \( m \ll n \). For example, in a university with one thousand phone sets, the number of simultaneous communications will rarely exceed ten. We assume \( m \leq n/100 \).

**Performance**:
- The server receives \( 2n \times m \times 10 \) Kbits/s. If \( m \approx n/100 \), a 100 Mbits/s bandwidth will be saturated for eight hundred users.
- Handling more than two or three hundred users is difficult due to the collaborative nature of the superposed sending protocol.
- In the Internet, sMIX is not practical due to latency constraints. The computational cost for the server is linear in \( m \times n \), limiting the number of simultaneous communications but not significantly in practice.

### PIR-based Servers

#### Private Information Retrieval (PIR)
- **Definition**: PIR allows a user to download an element from a database without revealing what element is being retrieved.
- **Efficiency**: Current PIR schemes are highly efficient in terms of communication. A scheme proposed in [11] has a small query size and an expansion factor of 2 on the communications.

#### pMIX
- **Operation**: Instead of broadcasting all user upload cover channels, pMIX defines them as a set of streams. Users privately choose one stream by sending PIR queries every few seconds.
- **Security**: The security properties of the PIR scheme ensure that all queries are indistinguishable to both the database administrators and global observers.
- **Protocol**:
  1. Establish an encrypted link with the pMIX.
  2. Set an upload cover traffic channel by sending encrypted garbage packets.
  3. Send PIR queries for a random stream among \( n \).
  4. The pMIX generates a stream based on the user's PIR queries.

**Bandwidth**:
- Upload: \( 10 \) Kbits/s.
- Download: \( 20 \) Kbits/s using the PIR protocol from [11].

**Scalability**:
- The computational cost is proportional to \( n^2 \), making it impractical for large user sets. A high-end processor can handle up to \( n^2 \approx 100 \), which translates to about fifty users.

### apMIX

#### Optimization
- **Reduction in PIR Queries**: Users use a superposed sending protocol, increasing the communication cost by \( 2m \) but reducing the number of PIR queries the server needs to handle to \( 2m \).
- **Computational Cost**: Proportional to \( n \times 2m \) instead of \( n^2 \), allowing for larger user sets. For example, a server with four processors can handle one hundred users with up to two simultaneous communications.

**Latency**:
- Not a problem for PIR query sending, as the acceptable latency for call establishment is a few seconds.

**Bandwidth**:
- Upload: \( 10 \) Kbits/s.
- Download: \( 4m \times 10 \) Kbits/s, which is manageable in a local area network but may be a limitation over the Internet.

### Conclusion

- **Internet**: The apMIX is the most suitable for providing unobservable VoIP communications to more than a few users, as long as there are not many simultaneous communications.
- **Local Area Network**: Both bMIX and sMIX can provide unobservability to one hundred users or more, but the apMIX approach is preferable due to better scalability.
- **Cost**: The investment in an apMIX is reasonable when compared to the cost per user of a VoIP infrastructure, especially if each user has a secured hardphone.
