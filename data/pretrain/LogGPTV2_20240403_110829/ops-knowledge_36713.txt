User: How to do load balancing for high availability architecture?
Assistant: The main purpose of load balancing is to distribute requests to different servers to achieve a high availability architecture. The following are the methods to achieve load balancing: 1. Hardware load balancing Hardware load balancing uses special load balancing devices, which are very powerful and can achieve fast request forwarding. Hardware load balancers are usually more expensive than software load balancers, but they are usually able to handle more requests. 2. Software load balancing The working principle of software load balancing is to distribute requests to different servers among a bunch of servers. The most common software load balancing tool is Nginx, which can not only achieve load balancing of HTTP requests, but also load balancing of TCP and UDP. 3. DNS load balancing DNS load balancing is to bind multiple IP addresses to the same domain name, so that each time the domain name is accessed, the DNS server will return a different IP address. This method is often called "round-robin DNS" because the DNS server will alternately return different IP addresses. 4. Session persistence Load balancers sometimes need to maintain client sessions to ensure that requests are forwarded to the same server. This can be done by using a cookie or by adding a session ID to the request URL. This method ensures that the client does not have to log in repeatedly or complete an operation from scratch. 5. Clustering Clustering is a method in which multiple servers join together to complete tasks. This method can achieve high availability, high performance, and high scalability. Each server in the cluster runs the same application, and the load balancer distributes requests among these servers. When a server fails, the remaining servers will automatically take over its work.
