User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Linux "ls" lists no files I have an embedded device with wdlinux (White Dwarf 2.0). I can access this linux using ssh or ftp.

Yesterday I performed "updatedb 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null" manually. (It will be performed as cronjob everyday morning). Today the linux system behaves strangely: 
(1) the command "ls" list no files any more. (If I log in using ftp, I can see all files)
(2) The command "netstat" shows nothing as well. 

I just executed "updatedb" without any arguments again. After that "ls" worked one time and then does not work again.

I am now totally confused. Any hints are appreciated.

Assistant: Are they hidden files? If so try:

ls -la
