Question: "Evaluate the one-time pad (OTP) encryption scheme. Consider the following properties and practical implications of using OTP in a scenario where Alice and Bob wish to communicate securely. Which of the following statements are true regarding OTP?"
 "A": "OTP requires a shared secret key of the same length as the message to be encrypted, which ensures perfect secrecy."
 "B": "If OTP is reused for multiple messages, it can lead to a compromise of the encrypted messages due to the XOR operation revealing the plaintexts."
 "C": "The IND-CPA security proof of OTP relies on the uniform distribution of the key, making each n-bit ciphertext string equally likely."
 "D": "The one-time pad's simplicity and ease of use make it the most practical encryption scheme for securing web communications."
Answer: ABC
