### Problem Description

The issue can be reproduced using the following fiddle: [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/dcromley/g791otyp/). This fiddle draws a line using `BufferGeometry` with the following material configuration:

```javascript
new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ vertexColors: THREE.VertexColors, lights: false });
```

Currently, this configuration correctly renders a line that transitions from red to blue. However, when the `lights` property is changed from `false` to `true`, the following error occurs:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'value' of undefined
```

This error does not occur in Revision 73 of Three.js.

While it may seem unusual to enable lighting for a `LineBasicMaterial`, I encountered this error and would like to understand the cause and potential solutions.

Thank you for your assistance. Please let me know if there are any best practices or guidelines I should follow to better align with the Three.js community.
