##### Description of the problem
The fiddle is https://jsfiddle.net/dcromley/g791otyp/  
This draws a line using bufferGeometry with  
` LineBasicMaterial( { vertexColors:THREE.VertexColors, lights:false }`  
As it is, it gives a correct red to blue line.  
By changing "lights:false" to "lights:true", it gives the error:
> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'value' of undefined
It does not give this error using Revision 73.  
Maybe, "Who would want to do this"? But I stumbled across this error.  
My thanks to all. Let me know how I can conform better to the threejs society.
