A Functionality of echoprint
At its core, echoprint generates a ﬁngerprint of an audio
ﬁle based on the time interval between successive ampli-
tude peaks (called inter-onset interval). Phonemes in human
speech — each unit of sound that distinguishes one word of a
spoken language to another — creates amplitude variations
in the call audio. Prosody in human speech introduces func-
tions like rhythm and tone to the call audio. These features of
human speech allow echoprint to generate ﬁngerprints that
represents a call audio recording.
To generate a ﬁngerprint, echoprint marks the amplitude
peaks and computes the inter-onset interval between these
peaks across 8 independent frequency bands of the audio
ﬁle. A combination of (i) inter-onset interval, (ii) the spe-
ciﬁc frequency band and (iii) time at which the inter-onset
interval occurs in the audio ﬁle are used to generate a non-
cryptographic hash value. Each second of audio generates
approximately 48 hash values. Multiple hash values together
form the ﬁngerprint of the ﬁle. We store the ﬁngerprint in the
ﬁngerprint database as a JSON object.
The matching operation of the echoprint framework
works on the fact that inter-onset interval of similar audio
ﬁles are identical [28]. When we query the echoprint DB with
a new audio ﬁngerprint, echoprint framework identiﬁes a
list of top 15 audio ﬁles which have matching hashes. These
matches are sorted, starting with the best match and ending
with the worst match. We get the top audio sample in this list
as a match if its match score is signiﬁcantly higher than the
match score of all the other matches in the list. Otherwise,
echoprint does not return a match. If we do not get a match,
we add the audio ﬁngerprint to the echoprint DB.
