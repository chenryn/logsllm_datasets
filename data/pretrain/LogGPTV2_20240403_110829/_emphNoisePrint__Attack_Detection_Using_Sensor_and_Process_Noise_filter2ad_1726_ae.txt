### Real Water Treatment Plants and Sensor Fingerprinting

In real water treatment plants, sensors and actuators can degrade over time, leading to reduced accuracy. Environmental factors may also alter the sensor's "fingerprint," but we hypothesize that each sensor will be affected uniquely. By retraining the system, each sensor can maintain a distinct fingerprint. Ambient noise or interference, which affects all devices similarly, can be canceled out from the sensor fingerprint.

### Implementation and Practical Considerations

#### Sensor Replacement
When replacing a sensor, a new fingerprint must be generated for the new sensor. Our current system has a scalable, system-wide model for a testbed, which is an advantage of the proposed method. If only one sensor is replaced, fresh data for that sensor must be collected, and the system model updated. Retraining the entire system (plant) is necessary if multiple sensors are replaced.

#### Training
Training requires at least one complete cycle of the process. For example, if modeling a water storage tank, the dynamics of emptying and filling the tank should be captured.

### Results
The paper presents three main results:
1. **Constant Bias Attack Detection**
2. **Zero-Alarm Attack Detection**
3. **Device Identification**

We trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for two-class classification using labeled data during normal operation. Class 1 represents legitimate sensor data, while Class 2 includes all other scenarios. During testing, the plant was run under attack conditions, and the SVM detected changes in the noise profile with 100% accuracy.

### Performance Comparison
Attacks studied in this article emulate system states. For instance, a zero-alarm attack tries to imitate the emptying or filling process by adding a small δ value to the sensor measurement, which cannot be detected by legacy statistical detectors like CUSUM and Bad-Data. These detectors fail because the attacker knows their parameters (e.g., threshold). However, NoisePrint successfully detects these attacks because arbitrary spoofing leads to deviations from the normal noise fingerprint.

### Related Work

#### Device Fingerprinting
Our approach is inspired by the use of sensor noise as a fingerprint for camera identification [30]. In [30], images are filtered to obtain noise components, which are then averaged to create a reference pattern. Test images are matched against these reference patterns. Other works have used microscopic deviations in device clocks [35, 42] and inter-arrival times of packets [45] for fingerprinting. RFID smart cards [18] and wireless access points [43] have also been fingerprinted based on unique characteristics.

#### CPS Device Fingerprinting
In [21], authors focus on device fingerprinting in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). One approach is based on network traffic monitoring and message response time, while another is based on physical operation time. This approach is not applicable to our study as it requires mechanical motion, which is absent in our setup. A preliminary study on sensor fingerprinting [4] achieved 86% accuracy but required a complete process cycle, making it slow for real-time CPS. Another related work [36] focused on sensor fingerprinting but had limitations, such as requiring static processes to extract sensor noise.

### Conclusions and Future Work

#### Summary
We propose a method for fingerprinting sensor and process noise for device identification and attack detection. We used two real-world water treatment (SWaT) and distribution (WADI) testbeds. First principles were used to obtain the system model for SWaT, and sub-space system identification was used for WADI. Once the system model is obtained, a Kalman filter can be designed for state estimation. The residual vector, obtained by subtracting state estimates from real system estimates, is a function of process and sensor noise.

#### Conclusions
Our novel method for fingerprinting sensor and process noise has shown that zero-alarm attacks, undetectable by reference statistical methods, can be detected. Sensors can be uniquely identified with over 90% accuracy.

#### Future Work
Future work will focus on isolating sensor noise from process noise to identify individual sensors. We also aim to increase the accuracy of device identification by generating and using multiple system models through a bank of observers for each sensor.
