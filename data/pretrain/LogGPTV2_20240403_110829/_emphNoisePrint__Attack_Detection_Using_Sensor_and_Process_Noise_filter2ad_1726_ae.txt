real water treatment plants as close as possible but we believe
the sensors and actuators wear out with time, rendering them less
accurate. There is a possibility that those environmental effects may
change the fingerprint but according to our hypothesis each sensor
will be affected in a distinct way and, if retrained, will possess a
unique fingerprint. As far as the ambient noise or interference is
concerned that would affect all the devices in a similar manner,
letting us to cancel out those effects from sensor fingerprint.
Implementation and Practical Considerations:
Sensor Replacement: Replacement of a sensor requires the gen-
eration of a new fingerprint for the new sensor. Currently we have
a system-wide model for a testbed which is an advantage of the
proposed method in that it is scalable for a complete realistic plant.
Hence, if we are retraining the model, we need to do so for the
entire system (plant). If only one sensor is replaced then we need
to collect fresh data for that sensor and update the system model.
Training: For training we need at least one complete cycle of a
process. For example, if we are modeling a water storage tank, then
the dynamics of emptying and filling a tank should be captured. Re-
sults: There are three main results in the paper: a). Constant Bias
10
Session 12: Physical Attacks and DefenseASIACCS’18, June 4–8, 2018, Incheon, Republic of Korea492Attack Detection, b). Zero-Alarm Attack Detection and c). Device
Identification. We trained the SVM for two-class classification on a
labeled data set during normal operation using a legitimate sensor
(class 1) and all other sensors and scenarios as (class 2). For testing
phase, we run the plant while under attack (attacks are launched
multiple times and residual vector is collected). SVM is able to de-
tect the change in noise profile when sensors are under attack with
an 100% accuracy. Performance Comparison: Attacks studied in
this article emulate the system states. For example a zero-alarm
attack when executed tries to imitate the emptying or a filling
process but by adding a small δ value to the sensor measurement
which can not be detected by legacy statistical detectors consid-
ered in this work. While the real system state would be something
different but readings sent to SCADA system would imitate the
physical process (emptying or filling) during the attack execution.
CUSUM and Bad-Data detectors fail as the attacker knows their
parameters (e.g. threshold) but NoisePrint is successful because an
arbitrary spoofing of sensor reading leads to deviation from the
normal noise fingerprint. NoisePrint is comparable to these other
methods because input to all these detectors is the same, a residual
vector and all of these depend on an accurate system model.
7 RELATED WORK
Device Fingerprinting: The approach presented in this article is
inspired by the idea of using sensor noise as a fingerprint for camera
identification [30]. In [30], images are taken by a camera and fil-
tered to obtain noise components and averaged for all images. This
resultant noise vector acts as a reference pattern for test images.
An image is tested against reference patterns for all cameras being
studied and matched with one having the highest correlation with
image’s noise vector. The idea of fingerprinting a device remotely
based on its hardware is presented in [27]. Small microscopic de-
viations in device’s clock [35, 42] are used as fingerprint for the
particular device. In [45] inter arrival time of packets is analyzed
to fingerprint devices on a small campus network. In [18], 50 RFID
smart cards from the same manufacturer and type are tested for fin-
gerprints. Performance analysis on Received Signal Strength (RSS)
based fingerprinting of wireless access point is presented in [43].
CPS Device Fingerprinting: In [21] authors focus on the idea of
device fingerprinting in ICS. One approach in [21] is based on tradi-
tional network traffic monitoring and observing message response
time, while the second approach is based on physical operation time
of a device. Analysis is carried out on 2 latching relays based on
their operation timings. This approach can not be applied to devices
studied in our work because there is no mechanical motion of the
components as was the case for electric relays in [21]. A preliminary
study, on the idea of sensor fingerprinting is presented as a short
paper in [4], using 2 sensors, based on correlation analysis with an
accuracy of 86%. Besides lower accuracy, another limitation of [4] is
that it requires a complete process cycle (ten’s of minutes) to make
a detection decision, which is slow considering the critical nature
of real time CPS. Another related work in CPS presented a study
on the idea of sensor fingerprinting in [36]. However, to the best of
our knowledge, this paper presents the first attempt for a rigorous
analysis on fingerprinting the combined process and sensor noise.
The new approach is also able to detect attacks where an adversary
11
swaps sensors among processes [4]. Sensor swap attack would not
be detected by using only sensor noise. Another limitation of [36]
is that, to extract sensor noise for certain sensors (e.g. level sen-
sors), one needs to wait for process to be static. However, process
is not static most of the time and thus introducing another source
of noise i.e. process noise. The proposed scheme takes residual
vector as an input which is also an input for the statistical detectors
(e.g. CUSUM and Bad-Data). NoisePrint removes the limitations of
these statistical detectors against a class of well studied zero-alarm
attacks [5, 17, 37]. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work
has applied sensor and process noise fingerprinting scheme to the
detection of sensor data integrity attacks on ICS.
8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Summary: An idea for fingerprinting the sensor and process noise
for the purpose of device identification and attack detection is
proposed. We need a representative model for the system under
consideration. Towards that end we had access to two real world
water treatment (SWaT) and distribution (WADI) testbeds. We used
first principles and obtained the system model for a part of SWaT
testbed, based on the physics of the system. For WADI testbed,
we obtained a system model by using a well known technique of
sub-space system identification. Once we have system model for
our system, we can design a Kalman filter for the purpose of state
estimation. By subtracting the state estimates from the real system
estimates, a residual vector is obtained in steady state that residual
vector is a function of process and sensor noise.
Conclusions: A novel method to fingerprint these sensor and process
noise is presented. Our results have shown that zero-alarm attacks
cannot be detected by reference statistical methods but can be
detected by the proposed scheme. Moreover, we have shown that
sensors can be uniquely identified with accuracy higher than 90%.
Future Work: In future, we plan to isolate the sensor noise from
the process noise to identify the individual sensors in the plant.
Another interesting problem is to increase the accuracy of device
identification. Towards that end we are working on generating and
using multiple system models by deploying a bank of observers for
each sensor and isolate the sensor under attack.
