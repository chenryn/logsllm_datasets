**Abstract:**

Server virtualization facilitates the collocation of diverse workloads on a shared physical platform, leading to increased server utilization and reduced power, cooling, and floor space requirements. However, in such environments, achieving other desirable goals like availability and security becomes challenging. Specifically, enforcing isolation between workloads in a large, dynamic, and virtualized data center requires robust yet easily configurable controls at the virtualization layer. While commercial hypervisors typically offer reasonable isolation for individual virtual machines (VMs), they currently lack the ability to define a single policy that automatically enforces resource sharing restrictions or creates an air gap between workloads.

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a Hypervisor-based Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system for the IBM Power Hypervisor (PHYP). This system achieves policy-driven distributed workload isolation. We discuss our experiences, lessons learned, and the implications and trade-offs involved in providing MAC on a production-level, commercially available hypervisor. Our goal is to simplify the security management of data centers through centralized security management and policy-driven distributed access control and data protection.

## 1. Introduction

A workload consisting of tasks and services can be distributed among a set of VMs executing on a single or multiple platforms for reliability and efficiency. In this environment, hypervisors traditionally isolate individual VMs and enable resource sharing on the platform. The sharing properties between VMs largely depend on the discretionary decisions of administrators to correctly configure resource sharing (e.g., network, storage) according to overall workload isolation goals.

However, this environment lacks a formal basis for expressing controlled resource sharing, making it difficult to reason about the isolation provided to workloads. Data center operators want to ensure that resource sharing is based on the type of workload and that specific workloads are prevented from executing simultaneously on the same platform. Consequently, in multi-tenant computing or data center environments, it becomes challenging to track resources and distributed workloads and to establish proofs of compliance with workload isolation through audit logs.

In this paper, we investigate retrofitting the IBM POWER Hypervisor (PHYP) with a mandatory access control (MAC) architecture to enable policy-driven workload protection. PHYP is a commercial-grade hypervisor that provides the functionality and resources demanded by modern virtualization environments. It offers isolation guarantees to Logical Partitions (LPARs) and prevents programs running in one LPAR from affecting those in others. PHYP isolates LPAR memories and allows exclusive physical device assignments to LPARs via a stand-alone Hardware Management Console (HMC).

For PHYP, we provide a workload protection mechanism that mediates resource assignment using MAC on LPARs. This MAC enforcement is independent of the LPARs and does not require their cooperation. Our mechanism is based on a simple security policy that can be applied across heterogeneous platforms to enforce consistent isolation properties for a virtual data center. Adding MAC to PHYP allows administrators to manage a single policy for a workload and its resources, preventing information flow violations due to improper resource configuration. Additional benefits include supporting least privilege, establishing a basis for safe object reuse, and providing easier proofs of isolation and anti-collocation guarantees.

Our approach minimizes intrusive changes and relies on the core isolation capabilities of the underlying hypervisor (PHYP). Although similar to the sHype MAC architecture in the Xen open-source hypervisor, our challenge was to retrofit PHYP without altering existing infrastructure and software. We succeed by mediating configuration commands instead of runtime commands, which is non-intrusive and yields no runtime performance overhead. There will be some overhead induced by resource assignment, network configuration, and running multiple Virtual I/O Servers to securely share resources among VMs of a workload.

Initially, we explored implementing multi-level security (MLS) for the IBM research hypervisor in the sHype access control framework but found that our simple policy model, though less expressive, maps better to the VMM abstraction and operations. The VMM's coarse-grained operations, such as allocating resources to VMs and enabling communication between VMs, are intrinsically bi-directional. Our simple sharing policy fits better onto the virtualization abstraction because it does not require distinguishing read from write operations between subjects and objects. Consequently, our simple policy yields a less-intrusive implementation, making the adoption of mandatory security in a commercial environment more viable. If finer-grain controls are necessary, we propose layering access controls within Guard VMs as described in [21].

In this paper, we discuss our practical experience in applying the sHype access control architecture to the PHYP environment. Section 2 provides an overview of the PHYP platform. Section 3 presents our MAC design and supported security policies. Section 4 discusses the implementation of MAC on PHYP. Section 5 reviews the lessons learned in applying our approach. Section 6 presents future work. Section 7 reviews related work. Finally, Section 8 summarizes our results.

## 2. PHYP Platform Overview

PHYP is the virtualization engine for IBMâ€™s PowerPC-based System i/p platforms, targeted for corporate and data center environments. Figure 1 shows the main components of a managed Power Hypervisor platform.

### Main Components:
- **Logical Partition (LPAR):** Each LPAR is isolated and can have exclusive physical device assignments.
- **Virtual I/O Server (VIOS):** Provides virtual storage and Ethernet to LPARs lacking physical resources.
- **Hardware Management Console (HMC):** A dedicated PC that runs the management application, providing the interface for configuring and managing the platform.
- **Service Processor (SP):** An independent subsystem that performs system diagnostics and maintains platform configuration information.
- **Platform Licensed Internal Code (PLIC):** A non-blocking, interrupt-driven layer that enforces partitioned environments and manages hardware page tables.
- **Dispatchable PHYP:** A multitasking kernel that processes messages from the HMC and service processor, maintains configuration data, and directs LPAR startup and termination.

PHYP employs a para-virtualization approach, allowing operating systems to make hypervisor calls for requesting PLIC virtualization services. PHYP can run any operating system developed using the PowerPC Architecture Platform Reference Specification. Our workload protection focuses on mediating the sharing of platform and resources (physical or virtual) and relies on PHYP to ensure isolation of platform resources such as CPU, memory, and physical IO devices.

Because PHYP is closed-source software, there are limits on the information that can be publicly disclosed. Internally at IBM, there has been extensive review of the PHYP source code. With this in mind, we designed our MAC solution to be minimally intrusive and to leverage the existing isolation capabilities of PHYP.

The HMC communicates configuration information via the service processor to PHYP over a dedicated management network using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and password protection. PLIC performs time-critical operations required for virtualization, such as maintaining hardware page tables and Translation Control Entry (TCE) tables. Dispatchable PHYP, which executes as a hidden LPAR, provides non-critical platform services and processes messages from the HMC and service processor.

In summary, PHYP is a robust and feature-rich hypervisor that provides the necessary isolation and resource management capabilities for modern virtualized environments. Our MAC solution builds on these capabilities to enhance security and simplify management in data center environments.
