### Linux on OSF's Mach Implementation

Linux was hosted on top of the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Mach implementation, leading to the development of a core system known as `osfmk`. The overall system was referred to as MkLinux. The first version, based on Linux 1.3, was released as MkLinux DR1 in early 1996. Subsequent releases transitioned to Linux 2.0 and beyond. One of these releases was integrated into Apple's Reference Release.

MkLinux utilized a single-server approach, where the monolithic Linux kernel ran as a single Mach task. Mac OS X, on the other hand, uses a kernel base derived from `osfmk` and incorporates many enhancements from MkLinux. However, in Mac OS X, all kernel components, including the BSD portions, reside in the same address space.

### MachTen by Tenon Systems

MachTen, developed by Tenon Systems, was introduced as an unobtrusive UNIX solution for Mac OS, running as an application atop Apple's operating system. Based on the Mach kernel with a BSD environment, MachTen provided preemptive multitasking for UNIX applications, while the Mac OS execution environment remained cooperative.

Despite the similarity in combining Mach, BSD, and Macintosh, MachTen and Mac OS X differed significantly in design and philosophy. Mac OS X continued the NEXTSTEP technology, providing legacy compatibility and ease of transition through APIs like Carbon and the Classic virtualizer. In contrast, MachTen kept Mac OS as the primary environment, with UNIX running in a virtual machine (UVM) implemented within a standard Macintosh application. The UVM provided a preemptive multitasking environment with UNIX APIs, including POSIX, a BSD-style networking stack, and file systems like UFS and FFS. MachTen also included an implementation of the X Window System.

Although confined to a single application, MachTen consisted of various subsystems similar to a full-fledged operating system. At the lowest level, an interface layer communicated with Mac OS. The Mach kernel, providing services such as memory management, IPC, tasks, and threads, resided above this layer. Other MachTen subsystems, such as the window manager and the ARP layer of the networking stack, directly interacted with the Mac OS interface layer.

### Musical Names and Apple's Operating System Strategy

After acquiring NeXT, Apple adopted a two-pronged strategy: improving Mac OS for the consumer desktop market and creating a high-end operating system based on NeXT technology, initially called Rhapsody, targeted at the server and enterprise markets. Apple had a series of musically inspired codenames for its operating system projects, such as Copland and Gershwin, named after American composers Aaron Copland and George Gershwin, respectively.

### Strategies and Releases

The first release of an Apple operating system after the NeXT acquisition was Mac OS 7.6 in late 1996. This release, the first to be called "Mac OS," required a 32-bit clean computer with at least a 68030 processor. It offered performance enhancements in areas such as virtual memory, memory management, and PowerPC Resource Manager routines. Key technologies like Cyberdog, OpenDoc, Open Transport, and QuickTime were integrated. Mac OS 7.6 emphasized compatibility with Windows 95 and included built-in support for TCP/IP, PPP, and Apple Remote Access (ARA).

### Mac OS 8 and 9

Mac OS 8 and 9 incorporated features originally intended for Copland and Pink, such as the HFS Plus file system, Sherlock search engine, and the Platinum-look user interface. Mac OS 8 introduced a multithreaded Finder, contextual menus, and spring-loaded folders. Mac OS 9, released in 1999, was hailed as the "best Internet operating system ever" and included features like file encryption and the Keychain mechanism. The last release, Mac OS 9.2.2, occurred in late 2001, with the advent of Mac OS X, it would be referred to as Classic.

### Rhapsody

Rhapsody, based on NeXT's OPENSTEP, was first demonstrated at the 1997 WWDC. It included components such as the Mach and BSD-based kernel, a Mac OS compatibility subsystem (Blue Box), an extended OpenStep API implementation (Yellow Box), a Java virtual machine, and a Display PostScript-based windowing system. Rhapsody aimed to support key Mac OS frameworks and numerous file systems. Two developer releases, DR1 and DR2, were made available for both PowerPC and x86 platforms.

#### Blue Box

The Blue Box, implemented by the MacOS.app, provided a virtual environment for running Mac OS 8.x full-screen. It placed restrictions on applications and aimed for near-native performance. Later versions added support for newer Mac OS versions and windowed operation. The Blue Box evolved into the Classic environment in Mac OS X, provided by the Classic Startup.app.

#### Yellow Box

The Yellow Box, Rhapsody's development platform, included most of OPENSTEP's integrated frameworks and was available for Power Macintosh, x86, and Microsoft Windows. It featured the Foundation, Application Kit, and Display PostScript frameworks, along with development tools like Project Builder and Interface Builder. The Yellow Box evolved into the Mac OS X Cocoa APIs.

### Toward Mac OS X

After Rhapsody's DR2, Apple announced Mac OS X Server 1.0 in March 1999, bundled with WebObjects, the QuickTime streaming server, and other tools. The Darwin initiative, a fork of Rhapsody's developer release, became the open-source core of Apple's systems.

#### Mac OS X Developer Previews

Four Developer Preview releases (DP1 to DP4) were made, with substantial improvements:
- **DP1**: Introduced the Carbon API.
- **DP2**: Evolved Yellow Box into Cocoa and included a version of the Java Development Kit.
- **DP3**: Introduced the Aqua user interface.
- **DP4**: Renamed the Finder to Desktop, introduced System Preferences, and made the Dock an independent application.

#### Mac OS X Public Beta

Apple released a public beta of Mac OS X at the Apple Expo in Paris on September 13, 2000, for $29.95. The beta showcased key features like the Darwin core, Quartz 2D drawing engine, OpenGL support, the Aqua interface, and the Dock. Despite missing some features and stability issues, it demonstrated significant advancements in Apple's technology.
