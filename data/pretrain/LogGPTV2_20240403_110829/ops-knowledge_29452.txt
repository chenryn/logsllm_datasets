User: I'm using Python in Terminal on Mac OSX latest. When I press enter, it processes the code I've entered, and I am unable to figure out how to add an additional line of code e.g. for a basic loop.
Assistant: The statements which represent a block of code below end with a colon(:) in Python. 
By doing that way, you can add extra statements under a single block and execute them at once.
