User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the storage.BlockManager finding three blocks (rdd_2_3, rdd_2_2, and rdd_2_1) locally, and the python.PythonRunner and executor.Executor components running tasks and sending results to the driver. The executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend is also assigned tasks, and the broadcast.TorrentBroadcast is started reading a broadcast variable.
