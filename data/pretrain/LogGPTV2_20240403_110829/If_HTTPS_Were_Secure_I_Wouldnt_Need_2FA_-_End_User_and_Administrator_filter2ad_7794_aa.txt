**Abstract:**
HTTPS is a critical protocol for securing online communication, and its adoption is increasing. However, many websites, especially smaller ones, still lack adequate security. This study explores the mental models of both end users and administrators regarding HTTPS. We conducted interviews with 18 end users and 12 administrators to understand their perceptions, misconceptions, and threat models. Our findings reveal that end users often confuse encryption with authentication and underestimate the security benefits of HTTPS, while administrators, though generally more knowledgeable, often lack a conceptual understanding of the protocol's components and their interplay. Based on these insights, we provide actionable recommendations for improving user interfaces and protocols.

### I. Introduction

In the realm of information technology, securing communication content at scale is more critical than ever. Despite growing adoption rates, reliable encryption remains a challenge. HTTPS is the primary cryptographic protocol for ensuring data integrity and privacy in transit. However, it is not universally adopted, particularly among smaller websites. For instance, SSLPulse data indicates that as of October 30, 2018, 36.3% of surveyed sites still have inadequate security [1].

Recent studies, such as those by Krombholz et al. [4], highlight the complexity of deploying cryptographic protocols, even for knowledgeable users. Both end users and administrators face challenges in understanding and using HTTPS effectively. Users often encounter poorly configured sites and must make security-critical decisions without fully grasping the implications.

This paper aims to understand why carefully designed protocols like HTTPS do not meet the needs of users. We employ an inductive approach to formalize the mental models of end users and administrators, focusing on their perceptions of how HTTPS works and the types of threats they believe it mitigates. Our qualitative study with 18 end users and 12 experienced administrators reveals significant differences in their mental models and highlights key areas for improvement in future protocol designs.

### II. Related Work

#### A. HTTPS from the Expert Users' Perspective

Krombholz et al. [4] identified major challenges in HTTPS deployment, including usability issues and complex protocol components. Administrators often rely on online resources, which can lead to faulty implementations. Acar et al. [9] found that API documentation, a primary source for constructing mental models, also influences code performance and security. Fahl et al. [10] and Oltrogge et al. [7] studied the reasons behind misconfigured X.509 certificates and the applicability of pinning, respectively. Manousis et al. [11] found that even automated tools like Let's Encrypt do not always result in correctly configured HTTPS, indicating the need for better support for administrators.

While these studies identify specific tasks that are challenging for knowledgeable users, they do not explore how these tasks are actually understood. Our work measures user mental models to detect the reasons for inadequately secured configurations and security misbehavior.

#### B. HTTPS from the End Users' Perspective

To ensure safe usage of HTTPS, connection security indicators and warnings are crucial. Studies by Sunshine et al. [12], Harbach et al. [13], and Akhawe et al. [14] have contributed to improving these UI components. Weber et al. [15] and Felt et al. [16, 17] have explored the effectiveness of different warning designs. Despite improvements, adherence rates remain suboptimal. Reeder et al. [8] and Acer et al. [3] have investigated the reasons for low adherence and the root causes of browser errors.

Our work extends this research by examining how connection indicators, warnings, and other UI cues contribute to the formation of valid mental models and secure behavior. While related work has improved adherence rates, our results suggest that these UX components do not necessarily establish trust among end users.

#### C. Message Encryption

Whitten and Tygar [1] highlighted the need for different usability standards for security applications. Subsequent studies, such as those by Fahl et al. [20], Atwater et al. [21], and Herzberg et al. [22], have examined the usability of message encryption in various contexts. Ruoti et al. [25] and Lerner et al. [26] focused on secure email exchange, revealing operational constraints and the need for better key management. Abu-Salma et al. [27] explored users' perceptions of secure communication tools and the reasons for their non-adoption.

#### D. Mental Models

Mental models influence user behavior and reactions. Wash et al. [28] proposed ways to shape non-experts' mental models to encourage secure behavior. Bravo-Lillo et al. [29] and Renaud et al. [30] studied how users perceive and respond to security alerts. Oates et al. [31] and Wu et al. [32] explored mental models of privacy and encryption, respectively. Abu Salma et al. [33] quantified misconceptions about encrypted communication tools. Kang et al. [34] and Gallagher et al. [35] measured mental models of the Internet and the Tor network, respectively. Zeng et al. [36] studied user understanding of smart-home technologies.

Our work replicates and confirms some of these findings and extends the state of the art by investigating mental models of transport layer security from both end users' and administrators' perspectives. The configuration of HTTPS from an administrator's perspective is particularly complex and has a significant impact on the security of the Internet ecosystem.

### III. Methodology

#### A. Study Design and Procedure

Our goal is to understand why end users and administrators make mistakes when using or configuring HTTPS, leading to security-critical situations. We used a qualitative interview study with a diverse sample of participants to construct theories through the identification of patterns in the data (inductive approach).

We designed the study to help participants externalize their tacit knowledge, which, according to Kearney et al. [38], influences their decisions and responses. The study included semi-structured interviews, a three-part drawing task, and a short questionnaire. Twenty-seven interviews were conducted in person in Vienna, Bonn, and Hannover, and three via Skype. All participants signed a consent form and completed a questionnaire before the interview.

The drawing tasks, based on scenarios such as sending an encrypted message, online shopping, and online banking, helped elicit and visualize user mental models. The interviews were recorded, and notes were taken. We continued conducting interviews until we reached saturation, where no new themes or ideas emerged from the data.

#### B. Expectations on User Mental Models

Before analyzing the data, we discussed our expectations on mental models. We anticipated that both types of users would construct their mental models based on the protocols and user experiences they interact with. These models are also influenced by media, education, and experience. By making these expectations transparent, we aimed to minimize personal biases in our analysis.

### IV. Results and Discussion

Our findings reveal that end users often confuse encryption with authentication and significantly underestimate the security benefits of HTTPS. They also tend to ignore and distrust security indicators. Administrators, while generally more knowledgeable, often lack a conceptual understanding of the protocol's components and their interplay. 

Based on these insights, we discuss the implications for future designs of user interfaces and protocols. We recommend simplifying the configuration process for administrators and improving the clarity and trustworthiness of security indicators for end users. By addressing these gaps, we aim to enhance the overall security and usability of HTTPS.

### V. Conclusion

This study provides a detailed understanding of the mental models of end users and administrators regarding HTTPS. Our findings highlight the need for better educational resources, clearer security indicators, and simplified configuration processes. By addressing these areas, we can improve the security and usability of HTTPS, ultimately enhancing the protection of online communication.
