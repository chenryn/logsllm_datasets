# The Psychology of Computer Insecurity
**Peter Gutmann, University of Auckland**

## Why Can't Users Get Security Right?

### User Behavior and Rationality

#### Initial Perspective: Users as "Idiots"
- **Developer's Role**: Developers create security applications.
- **User's Role**: Users often apply these applications incorrectly.
- **Conclusion**: Users are labeled as "idiots."

However, this perspective is overly simplistic and unhelpful. 

#### Revisiting the Definition of "Rational"
- **Rational (Geek's View)**: How developers wish users would behave.
- **Irrational (Geek's View)**: The opposite of how developers wish users would behave.

Users are often deemed "irrational" simply because they do not conform to an arbitrarily defined standard of "rational" behavior, which is essentially "How users should be using my software, dammit!" This type of "rational" behavior is sometimes observed in individuals with psychiatric disorders.

### Insights from Psychology

The field of psychology offers valuable insights into how people handle security, but this resource is rarely utilized. Logic and probability are often seen as the benchmarks for sound reasoning, while psychology is considered irrelevant unless mistakes occur. Many textbooks present logical and probabilistic laws as the standard, then compare them to actual human behavior, making people appear irrational.

- **Gerd Gigerenzer, "Adaptive Thinking: Rationality in the Real World"**: 
  - "The heavenly laws of logic and probability rule the realm of sound reasoning: psychology is assumed to be irrelevant. Only if mistakes are made are psychologists called in to explain how wrong-wired human minds deviate from these laws."

### Economic Decision-Making Model

The economic decision-making model, also known as the Bayesian decision-making model, is based on traditional economic thinking, dating back to John von Neumann's work on game theory in the 1940s. This model assumes that people always know what they want and will choose the optimal course to achieve it.

- **Baruch Fischhoff, "Decision Making in Complex Systems"**:
  - "This model took its marching orders from standard American economics, which assumes that people always know what they want and choose the optimal course of action for getting it."

### Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) Theory

SEU theory formalizes the economic decision-making model with the following assumptions:
1. The decision-maker has a utility function to rank preferences based on future outcomes.
2. The decision-maker has a complete overview of all possible strategies.
3. The decision-maker can estimate the probability of each outcome.
4. The decision-maker chooses alternatives based on their subjective expected utility.

#### Applying the SEU Model
To apply the SEU model, follow this algorithm for each possible decision alternative:
- \( x \): All possible consequences of a decision (including recursive effects).
- \( p(x) \): Probability of each consequence.
- \( U(x) \): Subjective utility of each consequence.
- \( p(x) \times U(x) \): Probability multiplied by subjective utility.
- \( \text{SEU total} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} p(x_i) \times U(x_i) \).

### Case Study: Evaluating Server Misconfiguration

Evaluating the possibility of a server misconfiguration involves:
- Competence of administrators.
- Chances of error.
- Chances of software bugs.
- Other factors like risk of credit card information being phished, identity theft, and mitigating factors like consumer protection measures.

Assign probabilities and utilities to each factor, then evaluate the sum total to get the selective expected utility for each option. Finally, choose the option with the highest subjective expected utility value.

### Flaws in the SEU Model

The SEU model requires total omniscience, a quality generally lacking in humans. Introducing stopping rules to address this issue still assumes total omniscience, making it impractical.

### How Users Really Make Decisions

#### Empirical Evaluation
- **Observation**: Examine what users actually do in practice.

#### Conceptual Modeling
- **Modeling**: Compare conceptual models to see which best approximates reality.

#### Singular Evaluation Model
- **Pressure and Dynamic Conditions**: Under pressure or dynamic conditions, users generate one option at a time and take the first one that works.
- **Evolutionary Example**: A monkey under threat runs up the first tree it sees rather than analyzing options.
- **Singular Evaluation**: Used when under pressure, conditions are dynamic, and goals are ill-defined.

#### Heuristic Decision Making
- **Popularity of Heuristics**: Simple heuristics are popular because complex decision-making processes provide insufficient feedback.
- **Gambling vs. Security**: Gambling provides immediate feedback, while security decisions lack such feedback, leading users to dismiss warning dialogs.

### Limits of Reasoning

Strong emotions reduce reasoning ability and working memory. For example, soldiers trained to exit a plane had difficulty recalling instructions after hearing a conversation about a potential crash.

### It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature!

- **Human Filters**: The ability to filter relevant details from noise allows humans to function.
- **Analysis Paralysis**: AI research has shown that mechanistically grinding through implications can lead to analysis paralysis, a problem also seen in OCD.
- **Browser Security Indicators**: Users asked to carefully verify security indicators spent excessive time and still failed to detect many false sites.

### Performance of Heuristic Reasoning

- **Comparative Studies**: Simple heuristics often perform as well as or better than complex models like multiple regression or Bayesian networks.
- **Overfitting**: Complex models can suffer from overfitting, while simple heuristics reduce noise.
- **Marketing Exploitation**: Marketers exploit heuristic decision-making through techniques like brand recognition.

### Consequences of the Decision-Making Process

- **Controlled Processes**: Slow, mentally costly, and flexible.
- **Automatic Processes**: Quick, low mental overhead, and inflexible.
- **Example**: Novice vs. experienced drivers. Novices manually check mirrors, while experienced drivers do it automatically.
- **Load-Shedding**: Under pressure, users may sacrifice control for speed, leading to errors in complex systems like aircraft cockpits and nuclear reactors.

In conclusion, understanding the psychological aspects of user behavior is crucial for improving computer security. By recognizing and accommodating the way users actually make decisions, we can design more effective and user-friendly security solutions.
