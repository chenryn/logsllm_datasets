Say you have some some incomplete data on weirdly growing plants, and want to
plot it as below. You might want to explicitly exclude the _tree_ data for
_outdoor_ , as you just didn't test it and do not want to confuse anyone. How
can this be done? I would have expected `sharex=False` to accomplish this, but
apparently it does not. I this intended and can this be done in another way?
(In my real example I also have set `hue='other_attribute'` but it probably
does not play a role in this discussion.)
    import seaborn as sns
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    from pandas import DataFrame
    data = DataFrame(
        data=[
            ['grass', 'indoor', 30],
            ['bushes', 'indoor', 80],
            ['tree', 'indoor', 100],
            ['grass', 'outdoor', 50],
            ['bushes', 'outdoor', 120]
            # this does not exist: ['tree', 'outdoor', 300],
        ],
        columns=[
            'type', 'where', 'height'
        ])
    graph = sns.catplot(x="type", y="height", col="where", data=data,
                        kind="bar", orient="v")
    plt.show()
