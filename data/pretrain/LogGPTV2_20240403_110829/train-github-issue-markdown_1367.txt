It would be very useful to read a components static attributes (not bindings).
This is probably a prerequisite for to #633. There are many use-cases for
this.
#### Example use case: imitating native input api
Standard radio buttons are put into one single-input-can-be-checked group with
the name attribute:
      Guitar
      Trombone
If a component author wants to support the same api on a custom radio button,
the author needs to be able to read the name attribute. There's usually not a
need, though, to create a binding on the property.
