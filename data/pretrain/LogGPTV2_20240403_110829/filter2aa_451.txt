**Tesla P85D Ludicrous Mode Upgrade: A Comprehensive Analysis**

**Introduction**
In 2014, Tesla introduced the P85D with "Insane Mode" acceleration, boasting a 0-60 mph time of 3.2 seconds. In July 2015, Tesla unveiled "Ludicrous Mode," reducing the 0-60 mph time to 2.8 seconds. This upgrade was available for both new and existing P85D vehicles, requiring modifications to the Battery Management System (BMS). This paper details the reverse engineering process, including CAN bus messages, UDS routines, and firmware files, to perform the Ludicrous Mode upgrade.

**Vehicle Overview**
The Model S powertrain network operates on a standard CAN bus at 500 Kbit/sec, supporting UDS commands. The Security Gateway, located in the Central Information Display, acts as a firewall, managing CAN bus messages and vehicle configurations. It connects multiple networks, including the Chassis and Body CAN networks, and an Ethernet network that encapsulates CAN bus messages in UDP packets.

**Battery Management System (BMS) Overview**
The BMS controls the power distribution to the drive units and other components. Key BMS components include:
- **Texas Instruments DSP TMS320C2809**: Main processor handling power availability, contactor control, and charger system requests.
- **Altera CPLD**: Hardware backup for the TMS320.
- **High Voltage Contactors**: Isolates the high-voltage battery from the vehicle.
- **Current Shunt with STM8**: Measures current through the battery pack.
- **Precharge Resistor**: Prevents inrush current damage by slowly bringing the vehicle's voltage up to the battery level.
- **BMB Boards**: Measure temperature and voltage, and balance the 6 sets of series battery arrays in each of the 16 modules.

**Hardware Upgrades**
Public information suggested that the upgrade involved high-current contactors and a hybrid pyro fuse. These components were acquired and installed, requiring the removal of the battery pack. The pyro fuse replaces a traditional fuse with a squib charge, allowing rapid separation of the battery halves. The contactors and current shunt were also replaced, and the BMS was modified to support higher current levels.

**Firmware and Configuration Upgrades**
Post-hardware changes, the vehicle's configuration and firmware were updated to enable Ludicrous Mode. The "internal.dat" file on the gateway contains the vehicle configuration and a value enabling Ludicrous Mode. The "packconfig" value identifies the battery's capability and upgrade path. For the donor vehicle, the pack configuration was changed from "57" to "70."

**Reverse Engineering and Testing**
The diagnostic application, Toolbox, was used to extract and decompile Python source code, revealing firmware files and calibration data. A test bench was fabricated to validate the CAN DBC files and UDS ODX routines. The firmware upgrade process involved flashing the BMS, calibrating the current shunt, and updating the gateway configuration.

**Upgrade Process**
1. Flash the BMS application partition with the appropriate firmware.
2. Read and update the shunt calibration using UDS routines.
3. Flash the bootloader and change its value from 57 to 70.
4. Update the gateway "internal.dat" file with the new Packconfig and Performanceaddon values.
5. Redeploy software using the CID updater or modify the gatewayâ€™s firmware.rc file.

**Challenges and Solutions**
During the upgrade, the car encountered a BMS mismatch error, which was resolved by modifying the "firmware.rc" file on the gateway. The correct CRC value was recalculated, and the file was uploaded, clearing the errors and enabling the vehicle to operate with Ludicrous Mode.

**Conclusion**
This paper provides a detailed analysis of the Ludicrous Mode upgrade process for the Tesla P85D, including hardware and firmware modifications, and the steps taken to resolve challenges. The successful implementation of this upgrade highlights the complexity and precision required in modern electric vehicle systems.
