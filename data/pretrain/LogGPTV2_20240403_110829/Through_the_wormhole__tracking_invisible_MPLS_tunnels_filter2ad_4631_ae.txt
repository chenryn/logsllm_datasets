PLA. For each revealed tunnel towards an Egress LER, we add the
number of revealed hops (either with DPR or BRPR) to the for-
ward path length, and then, we re-analyze the Return and For-
ward Asymmetry (RFA). We notice that it works very well for most
networks. In particular, for all Egress LERs considered in Fig. 7b,
we see that the corrected Egress curve (black curve on Fig. 7b)
is almost centered at 0 compared to the curves for the non cor-
rected distribution. Again, we observe that the shift in asymmetry
is much more remarkable when looking only at forward tunnels
revealed with path revelation mechanisms: it means that FRPLA
is much more coherent for Egress for which we revealed a tunnel
than for those we were unable. These results are aligned with our
discussion about the standard conﬁgurations when we state that
both techniques apply (revelation and length analysis) to the same
conﬁgurations (see Sec. 3.4).

for FRPLA). This higher accuracy comes from the fact that it pro-
vides exactly the return tunnel length instead of the total return
path length (as with FRPLA). This analysis, based on RTLA results,
works thanks to our particular campaign design: we speciﬁcally
target HDN Egress LERs (and their neighbors, again Ingress/Egress
LERs or borders of other domains) that are likely to be themselves
entry points for tunnels being the ﬁrst segment of the return path.
When building ICMP messages, the Egress LER sets the IP-TTL to
its maximum value (255 – time-exceeded– or 64 – echo-reply–
for Juniper, always 255 for Cisco). If 255 is used, the LSE-TTL will
be lower or equal to the IP-TTL when exiting the return tunnel on
the return path. The min behavior will then replace the IP-TTL by
the lower LSE-TTL value. However, when using 64 as initial TTL,
as it is the case for echo-reply on Juniper routers, the LSE-TTL
will always be greater that the IP-TTL, and the min behavior will
let the IP-TTL unchanged. Hence the gap between the path lengths
obtained with time-exceeded and echo-reply messages directly
provides the return tunnel length.
Fig. 8 shows the gap between the lengths of return/forward paths
(RFA) considering both IP-TTLs of Juniper LERs. If we compare
the two curves, we observe a shift towards the positive values
for the time-exceeded messages. Indeed, the asymmetry of paths
does not follow a normal law centered in 0 for this type of mes-
sage (blue curve), as the median equals 4. However, if we consider
echo-reply messages (black curve), the distribution is almost cen-
tered in 0 (the highest peak is at 0 while the median is 2). The
reason is that with an IP-TTL value of 64, the return path does
not exhibit a really signiﬁcant signal of any return tunnel. The
asymmetrical shape of the black curve may be due to some TTL
operation variation at one hop (the last hop of the return tunnel in
particular).

Fig. 9a shows the tunnel length distribution for the return LSP as
revealed with RTLA. We can compare it to the one of forward LSP
given in Fig. 5. Both distributions look very similar. On Fig. 9a, the
low amount of negative values (the shaded area) probably comes
from ECMP variations, or other speciﬁc return path noise for some
of our Vantage Points. On Fig. 9b, we try to assess the accuracy of
RTLA. In the fashion of what we have done for Fig. 7b, we subtract
the return tunnel length (as depicted in the scheme given in Fig. 3)
with the actual forward tunnel length (FTL) obtained either with
DPR or BRPR. It seems to work well at this global scale: the distri-
bution almost follows a normal law centered in 0 as expected.

6 MPLS ANALYSIS
One lesson of our measurements is that MPLS deployment, hence
its behavior, is greatly variable from one ISP to another, as can be
seen from Table 5. In this table, we detail MPLS deployment charac-
teristics for the same networks given in Table 4. First, we sort them
considering their signatures (see Table 1): ﬁrst ranked ASes belong
mostly to Cisco while last ranked ones mainly include Juniper de-
vices. Second, we provide the scores of our two active revelation
techniques (their relative eﬃciency) and their possible combina-
tion (“Others”). Finally, we show how FRPLA and RTLA perform
compared to them for estimating the average tunnel length (“FTL”
gives the Forward Tunnel Length in term of number of hops, as
revealed with our path revelation technique).
In Table 5, when looking at hardware deployed (TTL signature
columns) and hidden hop discovery techniques, we observe two
tendencies. First, we have several ASes that show a consistent be-
havior. For instance, AS3257 (and, to a lower extent, AS9498) is
built around Juniper hardware. As expected, the vast majority of
hidden IP interfaces is revealed with DPR. On the contrary, while
AS3491 deploys mostly Cisco hardware, BRPR succeeds in general
to reveal hidden hops. Second, other ASes appear to deploy a mix
of router vendors and, and thus, as mentioned in Sec. 3.3, DPR pro-
vides better results. It is worth noticing that AS3549 is the only one
with a high prevalence of the TTL signature , and the most
eﬃcient discovery method is DPR. So, the behavior associated to
this signature looks similar to the Juniper routers behavior. An-
other ﬁnding for AS3549 (not shown on the Table) is that Juniper
seems prevalent at the edge (Ingress and Egress) while the 
signature is prevalent in the core (revealed IP addresses).
The last group of columns in the table looks at the return tunnel
length estimation (with FRPLA) and inference (RTLA), and com-
pares them to the forward tunnel length revealed by path revela-
tion techniques. AS2856 is not signiﬁcant in this case since almost
no tunnels were revealed (as stated in Table 4). We see that, for FR-
PLA, the median is not far from the actual median tunnel length,
considering that this method is sensitive to asymmetric routing.
RTLA, when feasible (i.e., Juniper Egress routers), provides a value
consistent with the tunnel length (see “FTL” in Table 5). This indi-
cates that the TTL behavior at the Egress router on the return tun-
nel is often the min one. This was expected for AS6762 or AS3320
as they mix Cisco and Juniper routers. This is more surprising
for AS3257 as it seems fully Juniper. This probably suggests that
AS3257 deploys unusual MPLS conﬁguration. Finally, as AS1299

bution. Peak values disappear.
seems to mainly contain really short tunnels (77% of revealed tun-
nels are classiﬁed as “DPR or BRPR”, meaning that only one LSR is
retrieved). It explains, at least partially, why FRPLA and RTLA do
not provide signiﬁcant information for it.
7 INTERNET MODEL UPDATE
One of the key metrics in Internet modeling comes from the
seminal paper by Faloutsos et al. [21]: the node degree distribu-
tion. This metric gives the proportion of nodes with k adjacencies
(for all integer k, see Fig. 1). This distribution may be an indica-
tor of the network resilience to failures and attacks [25]. Faloutsos
et al. found that the node degree distribution follows a power-law
shape. If this has been heavily questioned in the past [16, 28, 31],
we advocate in this paper that invisible MPLS tunnels might artiﬁ-
cially increase node degrees, since each Ingress LER appears as the
neighbor of all exit points in a given AS. This assumption has been,
in this paper, the starting point of measurement techniques for re-
vealing hidden tunnels. Fig. 10 shows the eﬀects of hidden tunnels
on the degree distribution, and how this distribution is corrected
once the tunnels content is taken into account.
We achieve this as follows: we mapped each Ingress - Egress
pair to a router identiﬁer using the Caida ITDK dataset [10]. The
obtained graph is used to compute the degree distribution in the
invisible case (blue dashed line on Fig. 10). Then, we also mapped
all the IP addresses revealed by our techniques in MPLS tunnels.
The updated graph is used to compute the degree distribution in
the visible case (black line on Fig. 10). If we were unable to perform
the mapping with the Caida dataset, we assigned a new identiﬁer
to the IP address. However, note that we were able to map 97% of
the revealed IP addresses in the Caida dataset. After the mapping,
we counted the number of neighbors for the obtained routers.16
On Fig. 10, the Y-axis provides the PDF, while the X-axis gives the
number of neighbors.
Fig. 10a illustrates the degree distribution for all ASes. Two main
results arise: as expected, (i), when tunnels are hidden (blue dashed
line), the proportion of HDNs is larger than when the revealed con-
tent is taken into account and, (ii), two peaks are observed (for a
number of neighbors of 17 and 23). Those two peaks are due to
16Note that, for the comparison, we consider the intersection between our dataset and
the ITDK one. It justiﬁes that the degrees observed in Fig. 10 are much lower than the
ones in Fig. 1 as our dataset is limited to a relatively small sample.
