User: I have installed (or so I think) python 2.7.5. When I type "Python --version" I get python2.7.5
I've narrowed this down to:

When I run "python" in a terminal in my /Home/UsrName/ directory it is version 2.7.5
However when I run "python" in a terminal in /Home/UserName/Downloads/Ipython directory I get 2.6.6

I went into the Ipython folder to run the Ipython Setup file. I think I need to add python27 to a system path so that when I am inside the /Home/UserName/Downloads/Ipython directory and run the install file Ipython knows I am using a required version of python.
I am not sure how to add python27 to the system on redhat linux 6.5 (Also I am not even sure that this will fix it).
Assistant: You have your $PATH fine, as you can run python without specifying full path, aka /usr/bin/python.
You get 2.6.6 in Ipython directory because it has python executable in it, named, wild guess - python.  2.7.5 is installed system-wide. To call 2.7.5 from the Ipython dir, use full path /usr/bin/python, or whatever which python points to.
Try out python virtualenv if you need two or more version of python on your system. Otherwise, having different versions is not a good idea.
