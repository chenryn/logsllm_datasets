User: Now the hard disk space of a server is almost full, how to expand the storage capacity and mount a new hard disk?
Assistant: To expand the storage capacity and mount a new hard disk, you can follow the steps below: 1. Purchase a new hard disk and insert it into an empty hard disk slot in the server. 2. Install storage expansion tools such as LVM (Logical Volume Manager) or RAID (Disk Array) in the server. 3. Initialize and allocate space for the new hard drive for use with the existing hard drive. 4. Mount the new hard disk and join it to the existing storage volume to increase the storage space. 5. If necessary, transfer less important data from the existing storage volume to the new hard disk to free up more space. 6. Finally, the additional storage space can be protected by configuring automatic system backup and monitoring. It should be noted that before performing storage expansion and hard disk mounting operations, it is best to back up important data to prevent accidental data loss. At the same time, an appropriate storage expansion tool and hard disk mounting method should be selected according to the server operating system and requirements.
