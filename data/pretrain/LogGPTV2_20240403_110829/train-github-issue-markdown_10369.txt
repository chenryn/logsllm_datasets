A long time ago I also did an small tool for renaming files. I also thought
about implementing some sophisticated search and replace. But then it came to
my mind that 1.) there is always too many exceptions and using rules is too
unhandy 2.) a good text editor already has all these sophisticated features
already build in  
1.) So my idea: take the list of selected files or all files from Windows
Explorer  
2.) Open an UI with a powerful text editor, e.g. the Avalon editor control is
great!  
3.) Each file name is one line. Can't add lines or delete lines  
4.) Edit the file names using the editor and all the power of a great editor.  
5.) When saving apply the new file names.  
That would turn out much more useful.  
6.) Prio B: implement a file preview pane. When selecting a file name show a
preview of the file. This is espacially useful when changing the automatically
created names of images from a camera.
