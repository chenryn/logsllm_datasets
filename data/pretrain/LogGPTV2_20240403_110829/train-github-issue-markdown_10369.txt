In the past, I developed a small tool for renaming files and considered implementing advanced search and replace features. However, I realized that:

1. There are often too many exceptions, making rule-based systems cumbersome.
2. A good text editor already includes sophisticated search and replace capabilities.

Based on these insights, I propose the following approach:

1. **File Selection**: Import the list of selected files or all files from Windows Explorer.
2. **User Interface**: Open a user interface with a powerful text editor, such as the Avalon editor control, which is highly effective.
3. **File Name Display**: Each file name should be displayed on a separate line. Users should not be able to add or delete lines.
4. **Editing**: Allow users to edit the file names using the full range of features provided by the text editor.
5. **Saving Changes**: When the user saves, apply the new file names to the corresponding files.
6. **File Preview (Priority B)**: Implement a file preview pane. When a user selects a file name, display a preview of the file. This feature is particularly useful when renaming automatically generated image files from a camera.

This approach would make the tool more versatile and user-friendly.
