### Verifiability Goals and Definitions

#### Overview
This section categorizes various verifiability goals and definitions, providing a clear and structured approach to understanding the different levels and types of verifiability in electronic voting systems. Each goal is described informally, and we also discuss the associated verifiability tolerance, general trust assumptions, and protocol structure requirements.

#### Verifiability Goals

1. **E2E Verifiability (B, [18])**
   - **Goal (Intuition):** Ensure that all valid ballots cast by eligible voters, both honest and dishonest, are counted.
   - **Flexible γ:** 
     - **γ0:** All votes from eligible voters (both honest and dishonest) who submit valid ballots are counted.
     - **γθ,k,Extr (θ, k ≥ 0):** The published result differs from the correct result by less than k positions, or fewer than θ many honest voters successfully cast their ballots, or at least one honest voter complains if they verify the final result.
     - **γSV:** If the registrar (Reg) or bulletin board (B) are honest, then (i) all votes from honest voters who check are counted, (ii) further honest votes can only be dropped (not manipulated), and (iii) only votes from eligible voters are counted.
     - **γWV:** If Reg and B are honest, the goal is achieved.
     - **γIV:** All valid ballots from honest voters are pairwise different.
     - **γUV:** The published tally (Tally, P) on B matches the correct tally.
     - **γIUV (γ0 and γIV):** All valid ballots from honest voters are pairwise different and all valid ballots from honest voters are counted.
     - **γIV (on B):** The ballots of all honest voters who check are on B.
     - **γUV (on B):** The votes of all honest voters whose ballots are on B are counted. Non-eligible voters are allowed.
     - **γE2E (on B):** The votes of all honest voters who check are counted. Non-eligible voters are allowed.

2. **Verifiability Tolerance:**
   - **General Trust Assumptions:**
     - **hon(B):** The bulletin board is assumed to be honest.
     - **hon(Reg) and hon(B):** Both the registrar and the bulletin board are assumed to be honest.
     - **No specific structure required:** No specific protocol structure is required, but personal bulletin boards for each participant and binary choices ("yes" or "no") are assumed.
     - **Specific protocol structure:** Assumes a specific (Setup, Cast, Tally, Result, Verify) protocol structure with an extraction property.
     - **Partial tallying property:** Assumes a specific (Setup, Credential, Vote, VerifyVote, Valid, Board, Tally, Verify) protocol structure with a partial tallying property.
     - **Bulletin board requirement:** Requires a bulletin board B and assumes all voters verify. Otherwise, no specific protocol structure is required.

3. **Protocol Classes:**
   - **Yes (δ ≥ 0 allowed):** Allows for some tolerance.
   - **No (δ = 0 required):** Requires perfect verifiability.

#### Table Description
We group related definitions and provide a short informal description for each goal. The third column, "Verifiability Tolerance," indicates whether the definition allows for some tolerance (δ ≥ 0) or requires perfect verifiability (δ = 0). The fourth column, "General Trust Assumptions," describes which protocol participants are assumed to be always honest. The fifth column, "Protocol Classes," lists the requirements on the protocol structure, including the need for an extraction property, which allows single ballots and their content to be extracted from the bulletin board B.

#### Discussion

1. **Applicability and Reusability:**
   - It is desirable for a verifiability definition to be applicable to as many protocols as possible. This provides reusability and comparability, allowing us to clearly see the differences in the level and nature of verifiability provided by different protocols.

2. **Minimal Assumptions:**
   - A minimal set of assumptions on the protocol structure is sufficient to express a meaningful notion of verifiability. However, additional assumptions can help express specific properties like universal verifiability.

3. **Static vs. Dynamic Corruption:**
   - Most verifiability definitions focus on static corruption. The definitions in Sections VI and VII capture dynamic corruption of voters. Modeling dynamic corruption can yield stronger security guarantees, such as ensuring that votes from late-corrupted voters are still counted.

4. **Binary vs. Quantitative Verifiability:**
   - Most definitions assume a binary notion of verifiability (δ = 0), which may reject reasonable protocols. The KTV framework and other definitions allow for measuring the level of verifiability, providing more expressiveness and meaningful results for protocols that do not provide perfect verifiability.

5. **Goals:**
   - **Quantitative Approach:** Considers a family of goals γk, k ≥ 0, with a non-zero tolerance level δ. This approach captures the probability that more than k votes of honest voters can be changed without detection.
   - **Qualitative Approach:** Stipulates that votes of voters who verify their receipts are contained in the final result. This approach should also include a non-zero tolerance level δ to account for imperfect checks.

6. **Ballot Stuffing:**
   - Not all definitions rule out ballot stuffing, which can dramatically change the election result. We recommend that a verifiability definition should exclude undetected ballot stuffing and capture different levels of risk.

7. **Trust Assumptions:**
   - Some definitions assume certain protocol participants are always honest, such as the bulletin board or all voters. A general verifiability definition should be capable of expressing different trust assumptions and make them explicit.

8. **Individual and Universal Verifiability:**
   - Definitions of individual and universal verifiability were presented in Section VIII and Appendix B. These sub-properties should not be used as a replacement for end-to-end verifiability unless formally proven to imply it. Subproperties can be useful as proof techniques.

#### Exemplified Instantiation of the Guideline
We demonstrate how the guidelines can be put into practice using the KTV framework, resulting in a solid, ready-to-use definition of verifiability.
