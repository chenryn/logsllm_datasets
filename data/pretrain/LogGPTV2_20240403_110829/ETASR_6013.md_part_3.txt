### VI. RESULTS

#### A. Accuracy
In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of HCLPars and compare it with 14 existing log parsers. The log datasets used in our experiments include HDFS, BGL, Spark, Hadoop, ZooKeeper, OpenStack, HPC, and Proxifier (Table III). These log files are from distributed systems, and some of them (HDFS, BGL, HPC, ZooKeeper, and Proxifier) have been used in previous studies [17, 20].

To ensure a fair comparison, we conducted accuracy experiments on subsets of the original log datasets, each containing 2,000 log messages. For example, HDFS, which has a total size of 1.47 GB, was reduced to sizes of 300 KB, 1 MB, 10 MB, 100 MB, and 1 GB, respectively. Table IV shows the number of raw log messages in each dataset.

Table III presents the accuracy results of the log parsers across 16 log datasets. Each column indicates the accuracy of one log parser across all datasets, helping to define its robustness across different log types. We selected log parsers that achieved high accuracy in more than four log datasets: AEL, IPLOM, LenMa, MoLFI, Spell, Drain, and POP, and compared them with HCLPars.

#### C. Efficiency
Efficiency is a critical aspect when parsing log data. To evaluate the efficiency of the log parsers, we recorded the runtime required to complete the entire parsing process. Similar to the previous experiment settings, we evaluated the runtime of log parsers on 40 sampled datasets from real-world log datasets. The results are shown in Figure 9. It is evident that the size of the log is directly proportional to the runtime, i.e., parsing time increases with log size. Additionally, the efficiency of the log parser depends on the number of event templates. Simpler log data, containing a limited number of templates, is easier to parse. The efficiency of the log parser is particularly noticeable when there are many log templates.

Drain and IPLoM exhibit better efficiency, scaling linearly with log size. POP also performs well with large data. In contrast, AEL and Spell do not scale well with many event templates, while LenMa and MoLFI struggle with large data.

Figure 8 illustrates the parsing accuracy on different log dataset volumes. Some lines in the figure are incomplete because certain parsers, such as MoLFI and LenMa, cannot complete the parsing within a reasonable period (4 hours). The results show that POP maintains consistent performance in most cases, except for a 0.24 drop in OpenStack. Other log parsers exhibit clear drops in accuracy or significant fluctuations with increasing data volume, except for HDFS, ZooKeeper, and Spark.

The experimental results for HCLPars are presented in Table IV and Figure 8. HCLPars demonstrates very consistent accuracy across all datasets. For HDFS and Spark, the accuracy is 1 for all five samples. For BGL and Hadoop, the accuracy fluctuation is at most 0.001. For Proxifier and ZooKeeper, the fluctuation is at most 0.02. Compared to other parsers, HCLPars is the only one to achieve consistently high accuracy across all datasets.

For instance, BGL contains 619 event templates. POP can finish parsing within 5 minutes, while Drain and IPLoM take 10 minutes. AEL and Spell require a long time to complete parsing (1 hour), and LenMa and MoLFI cannot finish parsing 1 GB of BGL within 2, 4, or 6 hours, respectively. The experimental results for HCLPars are also shown in Table VI and Figure 9.

### VII. CONCLUSION

This paper investigates the automated parsing of large system event logs. Initially, a comprehensive study was conducted on existing log parsing methods and their functionalities. Based on the findings, the Automatic Log Parsing (HCLPars) method using Spark was proposed, which consists of three steps: removing parameter values according to acquired knowledge, grouping raw log messages based on similarity, and finding the common parts in each group to extract log keys. Many experiments were conducted on 16 sets of real-world log data. The results indicate that HCLPars is highly effective, as it works accurately and efficiently on all types of log data, regardless of their size. Future work will involve testing this method on more log data.
