User: Please explain the role of DNS and DHCP in the network?
Assistant: DNS (Domain Name System) is a service of the Internet, which converts domain names (such as "www.baidu.com") into IP addresses (such as "220.181.38.148") for data transfer when using the Internet. DNS servers take care of this service, allowing users to use easy-to-remember domain names instead of remembering IP addresses for each connection. The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) protocol is a network protocol that automatically configures IP addresses. A DHCP server is responsible for assigning IP addresses to network devices, along with other important parameters such as default gateway, DNS server, and subnet mask. The DHCP protocol provides network administrators with simplified management and maintenance functions, and ensures that each device has a valid network configuration so that it can communicate with other devices.
