• Current PIN Cracking Methods 
• Cracking with Robots 
• R2B2 
• C3BO 
• Defeating the Robots 
Agenda 
• One of the most popular ways to lock 
mobile devices 
• Commonly still only 4-digit despite 
ability to be longer 
• User chosen, so typically low-entropy 
PINs 
PIN Cracking Now 
• Jailbreak and Crack 
• Keyboard Emulation 
• Punish an Intern 
Jailbreak and Crack 
• Use jailbreaking/rooting exploits on the 
device 
• Bypass the lock screen with these new user 
capabilities  
• Problem: not all devices have known exploits 
for gaining root (and without wiping the 
device) 
Keyboard Emulation 
• If the device supports a keyboard attachment 
• Make a device that emulates a keyboard and 
tries all the different PIN combinations 
automatically 
• Problem: not all devices support an external 
keyboard being added 
Punish an Intern 
• Forcing your intern to try all 10,000 4-digit 
combinations will surely be more productive 
than anything else they could have been 
doing, except maybe getting coffee 
• Problem: Interns are universally bad at their 
jobs, so they might miss some of the 
combinations 
PIN Cracking with Robots 
• Required Abilities: 
• “Push” buttons in sequence 
• Remember what buttons were pushed 
• (Recognize success) 
Robotic Reconfigurable Button Basher 
(R2B2)  
• Homemade Delta Robot body 
• Arduino Uno brain 
• Total cost: < $200 
Delta Robot 
• Designed for fast precision 
industrial work 
• Simple combination of 3 
single-motor arms gives 
precision 3D movement with 
somewhat small range of 
motion 
• Fairly simple motion control

Arduino Uno 
• Standard robotic hobby microcontroller board 
• Open source code for controlling a delta robot by 
Dan Royer (marginallyclever.com) 
• Uses serial port communication to control the 
movement of the robot  
• Easy to tweak functionality for pressing buttons 
instead of manufacturing 
• Easy to control with a Python program 
Modifications 
• The original delta robot kit was modified to 
have its tool be a touch-screen stylus tip for 
pressing buttons 
• A camera was added to allow easier user 
interface with the robot to set up the PIN 
cracking task 
• The motion control software was modified to 
speed up movement, up to 5 presses/second 
Wrap Everything in Python 
• Controls the robot movement through the 
serial port 
• Performs image analysis of the camera feed 
• Provides a simple interface for the user to set 
the robot up for PIN cracking  
• Detects success of PIN cracking to stop robot 
and alert user 
(a bit) Better than brute-forcing 
• Compiled the various 
password datasets and 
extracted 4-digit PINs to 
generate a frequency table 
of the 10,000 possibilities. 
Challenges 
• Detecting button values: 
• Too tough to reliably do on all devices 
• User set up time is negligible  for a 10-digit keypad 
• Recognizing delays: 
• Some devices have more easily recognized delay 
messages than others 
• If necessary, the user can manually input the delay 
pattern of a device (i.e. 30 seconds every 5 tries) 
Real Buttons Too! 
• R2B2 can of course also be used for brute-
force PIN cracking of physical buttons as well 
• Electronic keypads or completely mechanical 
keys, provided it can detect when it has 
succeeded 
Capacitive Cartesian Coordinate 
Bruteforcing Overlay (C3BO) 
• Attach a grid of electrodes to the device’s virtual 
keyboard 
• Trigger electrodes via an Arduino to trick the 
device into thinking the screen was touched at 
that point 
• No mechanical motion = faster button pressing 
• More user configuration required to manually 
place the electrodes 
C3BO continued 
• Cheaper than R2B2 ( ~ $50) 
• Nearly the same software for 
controlling/detecting device state changes 
with camera 
Defeating the Robots 
• Forced delay timer after X attempts 
• On Android this is always 30 seconds 
regardless of previous attempts 
• R2B2 would succeed in a worst case of ~20 hours 
• User Lockout after X attempts 
• On iOS this occurs after 11 attempts 
• R2B2 would be defeated, unless the PIN was one of 
the 10 most popular 
Are these robots useful, then? 
• Compared to R2B2: 
• Jailbreak + Bypass: Best if available 
• Keyboard Emulator: The fastest brute-forcing 
• C3BO: Usable on any capacitive touch keyboard, a 
bit slower and more setup required than a 
keyboard emulator 
• R2B2: Flexible and usable on basically any PIN 
protected device but slower and more 
cumbersome
