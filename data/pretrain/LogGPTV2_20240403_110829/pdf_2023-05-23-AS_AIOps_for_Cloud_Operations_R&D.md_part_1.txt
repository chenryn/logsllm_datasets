## Overview
### Talk & Conference
**Title:** AIOps for Cloud Reliability: Research and Development

**Abstract:**
Since 2016, we have been leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics (AIOps) to anticipate and respond to failures in real-time. Our primary goal is to reduce the need for human intervention in daily operations at HUAWEI CLOUD and data centers, thereby enhancing infrastructure reliability and availability. This presentation will cover:
1. An overview of emerging technologies in automation, monitoring, observability, and cloud operations.
2. A timeline of our past work on distributed trace analysis, log analysis, time series analysis, secure operations, hardware failure prediction, network verification, and AI-based offloading.
3. A list of future research topics in our pipeline.
4. A brief description of our work using LSTM, BERT, and Attention Networks to solve cloud reliability problems.

The talk will also discuss specific problems we have addressed and provide a sketch of the solutions developed.

## Key Technologies and Trends

### Observability and Monitoring
- **Observability-Driven Development (ODD):** An engineering practice that enhances system visibility and context by designing systems to be observable. It involves instrumenting code to expose telemetry, making it easier to detect, diagnose, and resolve system anomalies.
- **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter):** An enhancement to the Linux kernel that allows specific instruction sets to run inside the kernel, providing deep insights into system behavior.
- **AI-Enabled Log Monitoring:** Applying machine learning and AI to traditional log monitoring to reduce the cognitive load on operators by correlating and contextualizing large volumes of log data from multiple sources.
- **OpenTelemetry:** A set of specifications, tools, APIs, and SDKs for open-source instrumentation and observability, supporting cross-domain data, topology, event correlation, pattern recognition, and remediation.
- **Intent-Based Networking:** A method for designing, provisioning, and operating networks based on business policies, with characteristics including policy-to-configuration translation, automated network activities, awareness of network state/health, and continuous assurance and dynamic optimization.

### Fields of R&D
- **Log Analysis:** Techniques such as template mining, temporal correlation, and command analysis.
- **Trace Analysis:** Methods like sequence/pairwise alignment and Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Multi-time series analysis, anomaly detection, and failure prediction.
- **Secure Operations:** Tools and methods for secure operations, including random forests, grid search, and decision trees.
- **Network Verification:** Techniques for verifying network configurations and behaviors, including SMT solvers, BDD, and eBPF.
- **AI-Based Offloading:** Efficient logging, auto change, and efficient AI training for edge/cloud offloading.

## Hardware Failure Prediction
### Memory Failure Prediction
- **Pain Point:** Incidents in cloud computing infrastructures caused by hardware failures, particularly memory failures.
- **Main Achievement:** Migrating customers' VMs before failures occur.
- **Approach:**
  - Combining hierarchical memory features and ML techniques for failure prediction.
  - Outperforming baseline algorithms by 11% (F1 score).
  - Reducing VM interruption rate by ~20% after deploying the memory failure prediction algorithm in production.

### Anomaly Detection
### Detecting Faulty Hypervisors
- **Pain Point:** Virtualization failures affecting VMs but not directly observable.
- **Approach:**
  - Quorum change-point detection to analyze individual time-series and use change points and voting to detect hypervisor malfunctions.
  - Key results: F1 score of 72% (2 VMs) and 80+% (3+ VMs).
