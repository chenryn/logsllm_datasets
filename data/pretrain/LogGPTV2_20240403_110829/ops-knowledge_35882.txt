I have two `.pyo` (compiled Python) files that I need to convert back to `.py` source files. However, the decompilation process using `decompyle` does not produce perfect results, as indicated by its verification.

Upon examining the decompiled source code, I found that `config.pyo` contains an array of user IDs:

```python
ADMIN_USERIDS = [116901, 141, 349244, 39, 1159488]
```

I would like to modify one of these IDs in the original `.pyo` file. To do this, I need to disassemble or otherwise manipulate the bytecode to make the change.

Additionally, in `model.pyo`, the decompiled source code includes the following condition:

```python
if (productsDeveloperId != self.getUserId()):
```

My goal is to change the `!=` operator to `==`. This can be done relatively easily with a hex editor for a Windows executable, but I am struggling to find a suitable Python disassembler.

Any suggestions are welcome. I am new to reading and manipulating bytecode, as well as to Python in general.

**Update:**

This is Brian, the original poster.

I managed to achieve my goal through a combination of trial and error and hex editing. By repeatedly hex editing the file, converting it to source, and observing the changes, I was able to identify and modify the constants (Admin IDs). The IDs were stored in the hex file as converted hexadecimal values, but in reverse order.

However, I still have not been able to locate and modify the `!=` operator in the bytecode. I heard that the latest version of IDA Pro supports Python, but I have not yet figured out how to use it for this purpose.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
