I am currently developing a webpage using Django on my PC, which runs Windows 7. I now need to test some pages on a tablet. I was wondering if it's possible to access my localhost from an Android tablet, given that both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network at home.

I have a Samsung Tab 2 10.1 with Android 4.0.4. I've read through many questions and answers on Stack Overflow and other forums, but I haven't found a concrete solution yet. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Certainly! The IP address `127.0.0.1` is a loopback address, which means it refers to the local device. Therefore, when you try to access `127.0.0.1` on your Android tablet, it will attempt to connect to a web server running on the tablet itself, not your PC.

However, you can indeed access your Django development server from your Android tablet over the Wi-Fi network. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Find Your PC's IP Address:**
   - Open a Command Prompt on your Windows PC.
   - Type `ipconfig` and press Enter.
   - Look for the IPv4 address under the section for your Wi-Fi adapter. It will likely be something like `192.168.1.100`.

2. **Configure Django to Allow External Connections:**
   - By default, Django's development server only listens on the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`). To allow connections from other devices on the same network, you need to bind the server to all available IP addresses.
   - Start your Django development server with the following command:
     ```sh
     python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
     ```
   - This command tells Django to listen on all available network interfaces on port 8000.

3. **Access the Server from Your Tablet:**
   - On your Android tablet, open a web browser.
   - Enter the IP address of your PC followed by the port number (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8000`).

By following these steps, you should be able to access your Django development server from your Android tablet. If you encounter any issues, make sure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network and that there are no firewall or router settings blocking the connection.
