User: Please list common load balancing algorithms and usage scenarios, and provide application cases in combination with specific business scenarios.
Assistant: Common load balancing algorithms: 1. Round Robin: Assign requests to servers in turn, and each server processes requests in a loop. Applicable to scenarios where the request processing time is relatively equal. 2. Weighted algorithm (Weighted): Different weights are allocated according to the processing capacity of the server. The server with higher processing capacity allocates more requests. Applicable to scenarios with different server performance. 3. Least Connections: Send the request to the server with the least number of connections. It is suitable for scenarios where the processing time of each request is different. 4. IP Hash Algorithm (IP Hash): A value is obtained after hashing the IP address of the request initiator, and the request is assigned to the corresponding server for processing. Applicable to scenarios that require long connections. Application case: Assuming that an e-commerce website has multiple servers, in order to improve performance and stability, load balancing technology is adopted. The specific business scenarios are as follows: 1. Polling algorithm: When a user initiates a general product purchase request, the polling algorithm is used to assign the request to multiple servers for processing in turn, because the processing time of each request is basically equal. 2. Weighting algorithm: When a user initiates a purchase request for a flash sale, the weighting algorithm is used to assign the request to a server with higher performance, because the flash sale request consumes more performance on the server than a normal request. 3. Minimum connection algorithm: When a user initiates a express query request, the request is sent to the server with the lightest load according to the server with the least number of current connections to ensure faster query speed. 4. IP hashing algorithm: When a user logs in to an e-commerce website, a long connection is required for identity authentication. Use the IP hash algorithm to send the request of the same IP address to the same server to ensure that subsequent requests after the user logs in can be processed on the same server, reducing the overhead of cross-server communication.
