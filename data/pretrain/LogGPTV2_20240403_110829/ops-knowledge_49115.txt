User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题HTTP to HTTPS redirect loop Firstly, I know there is a million of copies of this question already but after hours of trying solutions from all of them I've got nowhere.

So I want to redirect all incoming HTTP traffic on my Apache web server to HTTPS. I've tried several approaches and most of them have had 1 of 2 results: a) a redirect loop or b) only the very top-level page is redirected (i.e no directories get sent to HTTPS). 

My current virtualhost file looks like this:

&lt;IfModule mod_ssl.c&gt;  
    &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; 
    ServerName roboguy99.co.uk
    Redirect / https://roboguy99.co.uk/
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
    &lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
        ServerAdmin roboguy99@gmail.com
    ServerAlias www.roboguy99.co.uk
        ServerName roboguy99.co.uk
        DocumentRoot /var/www/
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key
        &lt;FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$"&gt;
                        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
        &lt;Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin&gt;
                        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
        BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
                        nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
                        downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
        BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;


This current config is causing a redirect loop.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Possibly useful information:


Apache 2.2.22 
Running on Debian (Raspberry Pi)
Accessing from Windows 8.1, Google Chrome


I'm away for the week so if I don't reply to any questions, that's why. I'm also going to remove the redirect while I'm away, so live-testing the site won't work at the moment.

Assistant: Add those lines in VirtualHost *:80:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}


Make sure you enabled mod_rewrite:

a2enmod rewrite
service apache2 restart


Check result with wget:

wget --spider domain.tld
