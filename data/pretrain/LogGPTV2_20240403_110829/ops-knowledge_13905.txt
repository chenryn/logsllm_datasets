User: Can I make a loop in Google App Engine that fetches information from a site?
I have made a small code that already gets the information I want from the site, but I don't know how to make this code run every lets say, 20 minutes.
Is there a way to do this?
P.S.: I have looked at TaskQueue, but I'm not sure if it is meant for things like this.
Assistant: Take a look at the GAE cron functionality.
