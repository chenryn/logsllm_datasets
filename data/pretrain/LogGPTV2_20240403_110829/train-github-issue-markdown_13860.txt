On Windows (and Ubuntu with Unity Desktop Manager), clicking on a taskbar item
with the scroll wheel button, middle mouse button, or shift + click causes a
new window to be opened instead of an existing instance. VS Code does not do
this.
Repro:
  1. Open VS Code and open a folder.
  2. Click the VS Code icon using the scroll wheel click.
Expected: A new VS Code window will open
Actual: The existing VS Code window is shown.
