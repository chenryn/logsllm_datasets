### Issue: VS Code Behavior with Taskbar Interaction on Windows and Ubuntu (with Unity Desktop Manager)

**Description:**
On both Windows and Ubuntu (when using the Unity Desktop Manager), clicking on a taskbar item with the scroll wheel button, middle mouse button, or by using Shift + click typically opens a new window instead of focusing on an existing instance. However, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) does not follow this behavior.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. **Open VS Code and a Folder:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.
   - Open a folder within VS Code.

2. **Interact with the Taskbar Icon:**
   - Click the VS Code icon in the taskbar using the scroll wheel button, middle mouse button, or by holding the Shift key and clicking.

**Expected Behavior:**
- A new instance of Visual Studio Code should open, creating a new window.

**Actual Behavior:**
- The existing instance of Visual Studio Code is brought to the foreground, and no new window is created.

This discrepancy in behavior can be confusing for users who are accustomed to the standard taskbar interaction on these operating systems.
