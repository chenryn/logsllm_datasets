**Subject: Seeking Alternative Notification Methods for Disk Usage Monitoring**

---

**Initial Inquiry:**

I have a task to monitor disk usage and notify a few users when the disk space is running low. I have written a Python script that checks the disk usage. However, due to company policy, I am unable to use email notifications from the script.

**Question:**
Are there any alternative methods to notify selected users in my network about the event (i.e., full disk space)? I am looking for a solution that can send a pop-up message or some other form of notification directly to their screens. Please note that I do not have administrative privileges on the network.

Thank you for your assistance.

**Update:**

After further investigation, I discovered that our organization's Microsoft Exchange server only allows emails to be sent from scripts if they originate from a server. I was able to set up the email notifications to be sent from the server, and this solution now works for me.

Thank you for your suggestions. This ticket can be closed.
