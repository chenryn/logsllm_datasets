User: I have a task to monitor disk usage and notify a few users when it runs out of space. I wrote python script that checks disk usage. Unfortunately I can't use email notification from the script because company policy does not allow it.
My question: Are there any other options that would allow me to notify selected users in my network about particular event i.e. full disk space? I mean some kind of message that will pop-up on the screen or etc.
Please keep in mind that I practically don't have any administrative privileges in the network.
Thanks
Assistant: Well ... I figured out that in my organization Microsoft Exchange will not allow email started from script except those originated from server.
I handled to start email from server and now I'm all set.
Thanks for suggestions.
