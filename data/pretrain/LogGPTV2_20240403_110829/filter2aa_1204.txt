### Why Use the Apple TV?

- **Popularity**: The Apple TV is a popular and widely used device.

### Overview

1. **What is the Apple TV?**
   - A digital media player made by Apple, based on Mac OS X.
   - Works with iTunes and iPhoto, supporting 802.11a/g/n wireless and QuickTime components.
   - The operating system can be easily modified.

2. **How is it Different?**
   - Built on an open-source OS (Darwin, BSD Unix).
   - Uses the Apple Frontrow application as the GUI.
   - No DVR capabilities.
   - Synchronizes content with iTunes and iPhoto.

3. **How Does it Get Modified?**
   - **The Old Way**:
     - Remove the drive (voids warranty).
     - Manually copy over scripts and binaries.
     - More reliable but time-consuming.
   - **The New Way**:
     - Point, click, modify.
     - Sometimes, installations may fail.

### Walkthrough Two Patchsticks

1. **atvusb-creator**
   - Creates an open-source patchstick.
   - Adds SSH, File Utils, Software Menu, and XBMC/Boxee.
   - Available for Windows and Mac.
   - Can also create a "Bootstick" for Linux distros.

2. **aTV Flash**
   - Commercial patchstick ($49.95, includes 1-year updates).
   - Installs many applications and integrates with NitoTV.
   - Available for Mac and PC.

### Forensic Data

1. **Hardware Analysis**
   - Small form factor, low noise.
   - Supports 802.11n and 10/100Base-T Ethernet.
   - HDMI, component video, optical, and RCA composite connections.

2. **Software Summary**
   - Runs a modified version of Apple OS X.
   - Based on FreeBSD, powerful and functional.
   - Capable of running Linux/BSD server applications.
   - Supports multiple video, audio, and picture formats.
   - GUID partition scheme, formatted as HFS+.
   - Four partitions: EFI, Apple Recovery, OSBoot, and Media.

3. **Basic Forensic Considerations**
   - **Discovery**:
     - Conduct wireless assessments.
     - Collect data on local WAPs, MAC addresses, IP addresses, and signal strength.
     - Consider USB drives, iPhones, and network file services.
   - **Investigations**:
     - Hard drive uses a GUID partition table formatted as HFS+.
     - Use Property List Editor for .plist files.
     - NetInfo database for configuration data.

4. **Files (Almost) Always Modified**
   - ATV OS kernel (mach_kernel) in /OSBoot/.
   - New kernel extensions in /OSBoot/System/Library/Extensions.
   - Secure Shell (SSHD, Dropbear) in /Volumes/OSBoot/usr/sbin and /usr/bin.

5. **Apple TV Files and Directories Important to Forensic Analysis**
   - **User Data**:
     - /Media/Scratch/Users/frontrow
   - **System Files**:
     - /OSBoot/System/Library/Filesystems
     - /OSBoot/System/Library/Frameworks
     - /OSBoot/usr/libexec
     - /OSBoot/usr/sbin
   - **Other Important Directories**:
     - /Media/Photos/Pxx (photos and thumbnails)
     - /Media/Scratch/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/autodiskmount.plist
     - /Media/Scratch/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist
     - /Media/Scratch/private/var/run/resolv.conf

6. **Areas Where Most Data Resides**
   - Log information in .plist files and Spotlight index.
   - /OSBoot and /Media partitions contain different log files.
   - 3rd party apps and data in /user/frontrow.
   - nitoTV and Boxee store data in specific directories.
