User: How to prevent SQL injection attacks and XSS cross-site scripting attacks? Please list commonly used protection methods, such as parameterized query, input validation, secure coding, etc.
Assistant: SQL injection attack: 1. Parameterized query: Use parameterized query instead of character strings to concatenate SQL statements, and pass parameters into query statements before execution, so that malicious input cannot be interpreted as SQL statements. 2. Input verification: Check the data entered by the user, including data length, data type, whether it contains special characters, etc., to ensure that only expected data is entered. 3. Safe encoding: Especially when splicing SQL statements, do not use simple string splicing (such as + or &), but use safe encoding methods, such as escape, encodeURI, encodeURIComponent, etc. to escape special characters. 4. Minimize privileges: Minimize the authorization of database users so that they only have the least privileges to perform specific operations. XSS cross-site scripting attack: 1. Input verification: It is also suitable for preventing XSS attacks, checking the data entered by the user, and filtering out the input that may contain malicious scripts. 2. Output verification: For the content output by the website, including web page codes, web links, cookies, etc., it also needs to be checked to ensure that only the expected content is included. 3. Secure encoding: Especially when outputting content, it is necessary to use HTML escaping, URL encoding, etc. to process content that may contain malicious scripts. 4.HTTPOnly: Set the HTTPOnly attribute to restrict cookies to be transmitted only through the HTTP protocol, preventing malicious scripts from accessing cookies through JavaScript. 5. Content Security Policy (CSP): CSP can limit the content allowed to be loaded on the page, including scripts, pictures, etc., reducing the chance for attackers to inject malicious content.
