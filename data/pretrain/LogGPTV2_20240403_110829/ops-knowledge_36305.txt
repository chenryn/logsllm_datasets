User: I installed python on mac os (mountain lion) with Macports.
When I run 
$python 
  It gives an error on "cannot import urandom" when I try to import pandas or matplotlib.
If I run 
$python 2.7
  Everything runs perfectly.
I want to change python to use python2.7 always. 
I tried using sudo port select python python27. But that didn't help.
Please help me on this, I'm new to mac.
Assistant: If I remember correctly, you may want to do a "sudo port activate python". What does "which python" tell you? If it's /usr/bin/python, you're running OSX Python. If, OTOH, it's /usr/local/bin/python you're probably using the ports version.
