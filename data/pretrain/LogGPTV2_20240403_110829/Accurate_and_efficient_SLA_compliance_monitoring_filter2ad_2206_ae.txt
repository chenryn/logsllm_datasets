level, suggesting that relative to the other DV matrix measurements
over this 60 second time interval, queuing turbulence along the path
is greatest during the period of CBR bursts. In contrast, over the
CBR burst period the RTP jitter values are often smaller than many
other jitter values during the trace segment. Also, relative to the
range of jitter values observed over the 60 second segment, the jit-
ter values during the CBR burst period do not stand out—they stand
out only in their oscillatory behavior. This effect is explained by the
fact that although an EWMA ﬁlter with a small value for α is used
(1/16) in the RTP jitter formulation, the view is still of individual
delay variations rather than the behavior over a longer interval of
time. Although the CBR trafﬁc source we used to reveal this be-
havior is somewhat pathological, our observations in this context
are consistent with the behavior of the RTP and DV matrix values
during periods of queuing turbulence in other trafﬁc scenarios and
topologies/paths (not shown due to space limitations).
Finally, we examine the performance of the DV matrix metric
in the star topology. A desirable property of a method for measur-
ing delay variation is that, in a multihop setting, it should report a
maximum over all the links comprising the path. In Figure 9, we
plot the DV matrix metric for links e1 and e4 which make up path
r2 for the CBR UDP trafﬁc scenario. Plots for other trafﬁc scenar-
ios and routes are qualitatively similar to Figure 9. Observe that
the DV matrix value reported over the path over time is generally
the maximum reported for the individual links. These results are
encouraging. First, the DV matrix methodology appears to yield
reliable measures of delay variation over a single hop. Second, the
performance of the DV matrix metric in the two-hop star topology
appears to be robust. In the future we plan to examine its sensitivity
to different matrix sizes and in more complex multihop settings.

7: Histograms of RFC 3393 One-way-ipdv samples for the
long-lived TCP trafﬁc scenario (left), and for the self-similar self-
similar trafﬁc scenario at 60% offered load (right) using the dumb-
bell topology. Each One-way-ipdv sample is produced by choos-
ing consecutive packets of a periodic stream.
Figure 8a plots 60 second periods of the RTP jitter metric along
with a time series of queuing delays (top) and the DV matrix metric
along with a time series of queuing delays (bottom). The back-
ground trafﬁc used for these plots is the self-similar trafﬁc at a
60% offered load using the dumbbell topology. We calculate the
two metrics using a probe stream identical to the SLAM stream. In
these plots we observe ﬁrst that although the RTP jitter and DV ma-
trix metrics are calculated in very different ways, they have similar
qualitative characteristics over time with the DV matrix exhibiting
a somewhat smoother proﬁle.
In order to expose additional aspects of the RTP and DV matrix
metrics, we introduced a CBR trafﬁc source that was sent in addi-
tion to the self-similar trafﬁc at a 60% load, also using the dumb-
bell topology. Over periods of approximately 30 seconds, the CBR
source alternated between on/off periods, each of about 500 msec.
The addition of the CBR source results in a period of oscillation of
the queue between full and empty as shown in Figure 8b. As with
Figure 8a, the top plot shows the RTP jitter metric along with a time
series of queuing delays and the bottom plot shows the DV matrix
metric along with the same time series of queuing delays. We ob-
serve in these two plots that at the onset of the CBR on/off bursts,
the RTP jitter metric oscillates in a similar way as the queue. The
DV matrix metric, however, remains smooth and at an increased
Table 4 compares the true loss rate measured using the passive
traces (true values) with the loss rate estimates of SLAM and the
standard RFC 2680 [8] (Poisson-modulated) probe stream sent at
the same rate. Values are shown for each of the trafﬁc scenarios,
and for the two topologies and are average loss rates over the du-
ration of each experiment. Note that differences in true values are
due to inherent variability in trafﬁc sources. Considering both re-
sults for the dumbbell topology (Table 4a) and for the star topology
(Table 4b), we see that the standard stream yields very poor es-
timates of the true loss rate, and that the estimates produced by
SLAM are close to the true values. Moreover, in all but a few
cases, the RFC 2680 probe estimates are off by more than an order
of magnitude—a signiﬁcant relative error. For a number of ex-
periments, the Poisson estimates are close to zero—a phenomenon
consistent with earlier experiments [35] and primarily due to the
fact that single packet probes generally yield poor indications of
congestion along a path. (Note that these accuracy improvements
are consistent with experiments described in [35].) The estimates
produced by SLAM are signiﬁcantly better, with a maximum rela-
tive error occurring in the case of the open-loop CBR background
trafﬁc for both the dumbbell and star topologies.
Figure 10 shows the true loss rate and SLAM-estimated loss rate
over the duration of experiments using long-lived TCP trafﬁc in the
dumbbell topology (top) and self-similar trafﬁc on route r2 in the
star topology (bottom). True loss rate estimates are shown for 10
second intervals and estimates for SLAM are shown for 30 second
intervals. Results for other experiments are consistent with plots in
Figure 10. The upper and lower bars for SLAM indicate estimates
of one standard deviation above and below the mean using the vari-
ance estimates derived from [37]. For the SLAM estimates we see
the narrowing of variance bounds as an experiment progresses, and
