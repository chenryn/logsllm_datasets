tries to authenticate without any further interaction with
another legitimate prover (let pTF denotes his success prob-
ability). The TF attack conducted by the malicious pair
(P,A) is said to be successful, if the help of P during the
attack does make any diﬀerence with respect to its success
probability (i.e., if pA > pTF).
In this attack model, the malicious prover is not allowed
to communicate with his accomplice at all during the time-
critical phases. Thus, any communication between them
during any time-critical round taints the session, which can
be formalized by the following deﬁnition:
Definition 2
(Tainted Session (TF) [17]). A time-
critical round Πsid[k, k + 1] = (mk, mk+1), for some k ≥ 1
and mk sent by the veriﬁer, of an adversary-veriﬁer session
sid is tainted if there is an adversary-prover session sid(cid:48) such
that, for any i,
(cid:48)
marker(sid, k)  nc, pTF ≥ 1
nc ), it can be ampliﬁed arbitrarily
close to one. Let us deﬁne a simulator amplify(e, IK) using
SimTF(e, IK) internally. This simulator can try k · n · nc in-
dependent authentication experiments with the veriﬁer, for
any constant k > 1. In such a case, amplify(e, IK) should win
at least n experiments with an overwhelming probability, as
stated in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. For a valid view (e, IK) of an accomplice A,
the probability that the simulator amplify(e, IK) wins less than
n of the k · n · nc experiments is less than e
any k > 1.

The lemma is derived from the Chernoﬀ bound. If n is

large enough, the average number of wins µ is (k·n·nc)· 1
k·n. On the other hand, if 1−δ = 1
is simply n. The lemma follows directly and, as a corollary,
if k ≥ 4, the probability is smaller than

3.3 Maﬁa Fraud
During a MF, an active MiM adversary, interacting with
a single prover and a single veriﬁer during many sessions,
tries to authenticate. However, he is not able to relay infor-
mation between the veriﬁer and the prover during the time-
critical phases. To discard this option, the tainted time-
critical phases are redeﬁned as follows.
Definition 4
(Tainted Session (MF) [16]). A time-
critical round Πsid[k, k + 1] = (mk, mk+1), for some k ≥ 1
and mk sent by the veriﬁer, of an adversary-veriﬁer session
sid is tainted by the phase Πsid(cid:48) [k, k + 1] = (m(cid:48)
k+1) of a
prover-adversary session sid(cid:48) if
k, m(cid:48)

Once this deﬁnition is given, the game-based deﬁnition of
MF resistance notion can be stated as follows.
