User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题zabbix, dicovery rule for smnp device not working Perhaps you can help

I have quite a few mikrotik out in the field. They all connect to one 1 have in our data centre via l2pt or pptp.

Im using zabbix to monitor them, its discovery rule for the network interfaces work great. However it doesn't seem to work for the one at head office.

I get this message in the log:

SNMP agent item "ifDescr" on host "x.x.x.x" failed: first network error, wait for 15 seconds.

If i do a snmpwalk i get this result

snmpwalk -v 2c -c public x.x.x.x IF-MIB::ifDescr
IF-MIB::ifDescr.1 = STRING: 1 - Internet
IF-MIB::ifDescr.2 = STRING: 2 - DMZ
IF-MIB::ifDescr.39 = STRING: &lt;l2tp-kepjbn&gt;
IF-MIB::ifDescr.215 = STRING: &lt;l2tp-km-1&gt;
IF-MIB::ifDescr.299 = STRING: &lt;l2tp-ct&gt;
IF-MIB::ifDescr.378 = STRING: &lt;pptp-ke&gt;
IF-MIB::ifDescr.381 = STRING: &lt;l2tp-in&gt;


So it is getting result back from the router.

To setup the check for each interface will take a lifetime, i'd rather try correct the discovery rule.

Can anyone assist?

Assistant: Up to version 2.2.2, Zabbix used GetNextRequest-PDU for low-level discovery.

Since version 2.2.3, Zabbix uses GetNextRequest-PDU for low-level discovery on SNMPv1 devices and GetBulkRequest-PDU for SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 devices, because GetBulkRequest-PDU was introduced in SNMPv2.

Your problem seems to be that the device does not support GetBulkRequest-PDU, even though it is monitored through SNMPv2.

As a workaround, you can try doing low-level discovery on that device using SNMPv1 (the rest of the items, except those with dynamic indexes, can remain SNMPv2).

Meanwhile, I shall also add you case to ZBXNEXT-2301, which speaks about being able to disable SNMP bulk for each interface.
