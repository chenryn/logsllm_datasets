I've described the original issue at stackoverflow.com.
CREATE and especially MATCH support more or less complex patterns that can't
be written without breaking up the pattern into multiple parts, separated by
commas. This is due to the one-dimensional nature of a line of text used to
describe the pattern in Cypher.
For example, in order to get my mom, dad and brother I have to split up the
pattern and repeat the node identifier (me):
    MATCH (dad)(mom), (me)-[:BROTHER]->(brother)
    RETURN mom, dad, brother;
I expected that MERGE would allow for the same syntax, but it does not: it
returns an error:
    Invalid input ',': expected whitespace, a relationship pattern ...
I can't split up the pattern into multiple MERGEs because that would give
different results (either the _whole_ pattern matches or it doesn't).
Can this be supported?
Thanks,
