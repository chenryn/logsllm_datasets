**Title: Unsafe at Any Speed: CISA's Plan to Foster Tech Ecosystem Security**

In 1965, Ralph Nader published "Unsafe at Any Speed," a groundbreaking book that scrutinized automobile safety from design to delivery and maintenance. The parallels to the security of modern technology are striking. In this talk, we will explore how products can be designed and built to be inherently secure, covering topics such as memory safety, open-source security, insurance, and the security poverty line.

We will also delve into CISA's comprehensive strategy to foster a safer technology ecosystem. This strategy encompasses several key areas:
- Collaborating with technology manufacturers to secure commitments to build more secure products.
- Empowering smaller organizations to demand better security from their vendors.
- Educating the next generation of software developers to prioritize and understand security principles.

Achieving a secure technology ecosystem is a collective effort, and we need your support and collaboration to make it a reality. Join us in this critical mission!
