User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I restore Windows 2008R2 AD Snapshots on a new server? We've been using Win2008R2's AD Snapshot feature to perform a nightly backup of our AD domain. I'm trying to figure out the steps that I need to run through to use one of these nightly backups to restore our AD domain on a 2nd server.

These are the commands we used to backup the AD DOM:

1. create a new snapshot

echo **** create a new snapshot **** &gt;&gt; %LOG% 2&gt;&gt;&amp;1
ntdsutil snapshot "activate instance ntds" create quit quit &gt;&gt; %LOG% 2&gt;&gt;&amp;1


2. mount the snapshot

echo **** mount the new snapshot **** &gt;&gt; %LOG% 2&gt;&gt;&amp;1
ntdsutil snapshot "list all" "mount 1" quit quit &gt;&gt; %LOG% 2&gt;&gt;&amp;1


3. copy NTDS snapshot to backup dir

echo **** backup the snapshot files **** &gt;&gt; %LOG% 2&gt;&gt;&amp;1
c:
cd "\*SNAP*\WINDOWS\NTDS"
robocopy . "%BUDIR%" /E /Z /NFL /NDL /R:3 /LOG+:"%LOG%"


What I'm trying to figure out is how do I use ntdsutil to mount/restore this AD snapshot on a 2nd computer so that it's now our Master AD server.

EDIT #1

After more digging it doesn't look like @Greg Askew's method of Installing from Media (IFM) will work for us. I should've mentioned this in the original question, but didn't realize it mattered. We're attempting to create a backup of our existing primary AD DS and would like to be able to restore this to a 2nd server as part of our Disaster Recovery (DR) process. According to this blog:


  ... is a fast and efficient way to re-install a domain controller and
  get it up to sync, (that’s the proper way to handle a faulting
  replicas/domain controllers in most cases). There is some common
  misunderstandings of the concept “Install from media” I terms of if
  the operation could be performed entirely offline or online, the short
  answer is: No. It can’t be performed offline; you have to be online
  with at least one writable domain controller in the same domain as the
  IFM source is taken from and even then you may not be able to be fully
  efficient and cause replication to happen ...


It doesn't look like you can use the IFM method to restore the first server in the domain. One already has to be in the domain. So IFM is only an option for doing "online" restores, not "offline" such is our case.

Assistant: You need to use the Install From Media (IFM) option:  

ntdsutil.exe "act inst NTDS" ifm "Create Sysvol Full C:\IFM” q q

We use this exclusively due to our DIT is 7 GB and it takes a week to perform the initial replication without it.
