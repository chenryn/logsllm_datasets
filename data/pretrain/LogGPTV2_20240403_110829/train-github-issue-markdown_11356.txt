  * have `formatOnType: true`
  * pressing enter on the end of the line does not indent the next line properly, it is not indented at all
  * I can repro for both TS and JS
Simple snippet to repro. Pressing enter on end of first line I would expect to
get indentation
    function f() {
    };
Works for our insider build so it seems like it is a regression -> important
