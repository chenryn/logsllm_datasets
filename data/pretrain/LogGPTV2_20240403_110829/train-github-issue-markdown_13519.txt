We have a `unique` function that generates a new collection, which mirrors its input but ensures each element appears only once, preserving the order of their first occurrence. We need to implement a corresponding `unique!` function that removes duplicate items in place and returns the modified collection. 

For optimal performance, especially with dense arrays, the array should be resized only once at the end, after determining the final size. This approach minimizes the overhead associated with multiple resizing operations.

This task is part of issue #20402.
