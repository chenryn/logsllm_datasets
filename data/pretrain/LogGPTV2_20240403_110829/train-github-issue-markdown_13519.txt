We have a `unique` function that produces a new collection similar to its
argument, but with each item only occurring once (in order of first
appearance). There should be a corresponding `unique!` function that removes
recurrences of items and returns this modified collection. Note that for
performance, at least on dense arrays, resizing of the array should only occur
at end when you know the final size to shrink the array to. Part of #20402.
