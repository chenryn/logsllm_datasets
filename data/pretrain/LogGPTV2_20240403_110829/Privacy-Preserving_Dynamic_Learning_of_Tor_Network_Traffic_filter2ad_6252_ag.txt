were included in the main body of the paper. Table 7 shows values
of entry statistics that were shown in the plots in Figure 2.
Table 7: The 10 minute mean number of circuits per client
collected during period 2 (see Table 2). The 10 minute mean
number of unique clients was 13,800 ± 153 (1.11%) with 95%
confidence. See also Figure 2.

B EXIT STATISTICS
Here we provide tables of exit statistics for graphical figures that
were included in the main body of the paper, as well as a graphical
figure that was not included in the main body of the paper for space
reasons. Table 8 shows values of exit statistics that were shown
in the plots in Figure 3, Table 9 provides values of exit statistics
that were shown in the plots in Figure 4a, and Table 10 provides
values of exit statistics that were shown in the plots in Figure 4b.
The distribution of total bytes per stream is shown in Figure 12 and
the full values are shown in Table 11.
Figure 12: The distributions of total bytes per stream (in-
bound + outbound) collected during periods 5, 6, and 7 (see
Table 2). See also Table 11 in Appendix B for full tables of
values.
Table 8: The 10 minute mean number of streams per active
circuit collected during periods 5, 6, and 7 (see Table 2). See
also Figure 3. (See the legend in Figure 3 for the total number
of all, web, and other circuits.)
