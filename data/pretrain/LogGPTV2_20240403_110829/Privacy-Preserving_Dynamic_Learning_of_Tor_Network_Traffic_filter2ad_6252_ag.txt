### Entry Statistics

Table 7 presents the 10-minute mean number of circuits per client collected during period 2 (refer to Table 2). The 10-minute mean number of unique clients was 13,800 ± 153 (1.11%) with 95% confidence. For more details, see Figure 2.

### Exit Statistics

This section provides tables and a graphical figure of exit statistics, which were included in the main body of the paper. Additionally, a graphical figure that was not included in the main body due to space constraints is provided here. 

- **Table 8**: 10-minute mean number of streams per active circuit during periods 5, 6, and 7 (see Table 2). Refer to Figure 3 for visual representation.
- **Table 9**: 10-minute mean number of inbound bytes per stream during periods 5, 6, and 7 (see Table 2). Refer to Figure 4a for visual representation.
- **Table 10**: 10-minute mean number of outbound bytes per stream during periods 5, 6, and 7 (see Table 2). Refer to Figure 4b for visual representation.
- **Figure 12**: Distribution of total bytes per stream (inbound + outbound) during periods 5, 6, and 7. Full values are shown in Table 11.
