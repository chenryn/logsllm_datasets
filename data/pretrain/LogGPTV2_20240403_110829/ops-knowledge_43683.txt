User: I want to capture stdout from a long-ish running process started via subprocess.Popen(...) so I'm using stdout=PIPE as an arg.
However, because it's a long running process I also want to send the output to the console (as if I hadn't piped it) to give the user of the script an idea that it's still working.
Is this at all possible?
Cheers.
Assistant: Can you simply print it as you read it from the pipe?
