It would be nice to be able to write:
    [f() for 1:n]
instead of
    [f() for _ in 1:n]

Here is some context: I wanted to build a `Vector{Vector{Float64}}` containing
empty `Vector{Float64}`s.  
`Array(Vector{Vector{Float64}}, n)` doesn't work because the inner vectors are
undefined. `repeat(Float64[], outer=[n])` doesn't work because it is just
concatenating empty arrays. `collect(repeated(Float64[], n))` works and so
does `[Float64[] for _ in 1:n]`, but it could be prettier. That's why I am
proposing this teaspoon of syntactic sugar.
Not a game changer but it could be a nice little addition.
I apologize if this was brought up before. I couldn't find it.
