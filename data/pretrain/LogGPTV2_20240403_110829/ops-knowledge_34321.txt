User: How to use Gitlab CI/CD to achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment on your own server?
Assistant: The following are the steps to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment using Gitlab CI/CD on your own server: 1. Install Gitlab Runner Gitlab Runner is the executor of Gitlab CI/CD. Gitlab Runner can be installed on the server to run automated testing and compilation tasks on the server. The installation steps are as follows: - Download the appropriate Gitlab Runner binary file according to the operating system on the server - Execute the following command to install Gitlab Runner: ``` sudo chmod +x gitlab-runner-linux-<version>.bin sudo ./gitlab-runner -linux-<version>.bin ``` - Register Gitlab Runner Run the following command to register Gitlab Runner: ``` sudo gitlab-runner register ``` During the registration process, you need to enter the URL of the Gitlab server and the registration token, and select An executor (such as Shell or Docker). 2. Configure CI/CD Pipeline Define the CI/CD Pipeline in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file of the Gitlab project to perform automated testing and compilation tasks after submitting the code. Here is an example `.gitlab-ci.yml`: ``` stages: - test - build - deploy test: stage: test script: - npm install - npm test build: stage: build script: - npm run build deploy: stage: deploy script: - rsync -ravz build/ user@server:/var/www/my-app/ ``` In this example, the CI/CD Pipeline includes three stages: test, build, and deploy. In the test phase, dependencies are installed and tests are run. In the build phase, the application is compiled. In the deploy phase, the compiled application folder is synchronized to the server. 3. Configure the trigger In the settings of the Gitlab project, you can set the Push trigger so that the CI/CD Pipeline will be started every time you push to the branch. Here are the steps to set the Push trigger: - Select "Settings" in the Gitlab project. - Select "Integrations" and "Add webhook". - Enter the URL of Gitlab Runner (eg http://<runner_hostname>/api/v4/ci/) in "Webhook URL" and select "Push events". 4. Deploying the application After successfully executing the CI/CD Pipeline, the application is compiled and ready to be deployed to the server. You can use various deployment tools, such as scp, rsync, or configure your own deployment pipeline to deploy the application to the target server. Summary Through the above steps, you can easily use Gitlab CI/CD to achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment on your own server. Using Gitlab CI/CD can help the team quickly build, test and deploy applications, and ensure the quality and stability of the project.
