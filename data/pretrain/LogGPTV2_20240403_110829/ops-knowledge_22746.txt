User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Which Windows Files Should be Monitored by HIDS? I highlighted my question below. Here is some background. 

It's easy to find data showing the most commonly trojaned/modified Linux binaries and config files. ps, ls, find, kill, lsof, passwd, shadow, syslog.conf, etc. are all frequently changed after a system has been compromised. It's also easy to monitor utmp and wtmp to be alerted when a user logs onto a Linux system or when someone reboots the system.

Windows seems to be much more of a black box and more difficult in general to monitor. Part of this is due to the registry and lack of plain-text configuration files while part of it seems due to the closed-source, undocumented nature of Windows. And when I say, 'monitor' I mean know in real time that a file has changed through alerting (not logging). Send me an alert via sms, email, etc when X executable changes or when the local SAM file changes or when a virus reboots the system to install an infected MBR. And really, integrity monitoring is easy, the difficult part is knowing what files on Windows should be monitored. We can't monitor and alert on all files.

Is there an official list of commonly trojaned/modified Windows files that should be monitored by a HIDS?

Assistant: A reasonable approach here might be to see what existing HIDS products do in this regard.  If we take OSSEC as an example, per the book on their site has a long list of both files and registry keys that are monitored for changes (P84 in the linked PDF)

In general windows system files are mostly in c:\windows, so a lot of files to be monitored will be in that location.
