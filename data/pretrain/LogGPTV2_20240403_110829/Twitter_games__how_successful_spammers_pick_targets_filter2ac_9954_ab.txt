found that 52% of spam proﬁles made use of mention tweets.
The corresponding fractions for successful and unsuccessful
spam proﬁles in our data are 1/5th and 1/4th respectively.
For other users, it is 50%. Since their data set was sampled
similar to ours, we conclude that Twitter spammers have
evolved their strategies in the last one year. Finally, when
looking at what percentage of proﬁles made use of a speciﬁc
type of tweet, Table 1 suggests that spammers are using
fewer types of tweets compared to other users overall. We
investigate this issue in detail next.
Table 2 shows the percentage of proﬁles that exclusively
used one type of tweet. We ﬁnd that over 3/4th of success-
ful spam proﬁles exclusively used only one type of tweet when
the corresponding percentage for unsuccessful spam proﬁles
is 2/3rd and for other users is 14%. This observation sug-
gests that spammers focus on a limited set of spamming
strategies while regular users use various tweet combina-
tions. Further, 2/3rd of successful spam proﬁles exclusively
use regular tweets, when the corresponding percentage for
unsuccessful spam proﬁles is about half and that for good
proﬁles is 11% (see Table 2). Both of these characteristics
could be used as features in identifying spam proﬁles.

4. STRATEGIES FOR PICKING TARGETS
In the following sections, we describe the diﬀerent strate-
gies employed by successful spammers in ﬁnding their tar-
gets.
4.1 Spamming Ones Own Followers
We saw in Section 2 that over 2/3rd of successful spam
proﬁles exclusively use regular tweets to send spam. Clearly,

Figure 2: An example Amazon aﬃliate program link (aﬃliate ID=scot0e-20)
for their spam campaigns to succeed, spam proﬁles targeting
only their own followers need to have followers. (A discus-
sion of the methods spammers employ to ﬁnd their followers
is in Section 6.2.)
We begin by examining the followers of all spam proﬁles
present on the ﬁrst day of our data collection. Figure 3 shows
the number of followers for both successful and unsuccessful
spam proﬁles. We note that about 1/3rd of successful spam
proﬁles have over a 100 followers. In contrast, only 1/6th of
unsuccessful spam proﬁles reach that number. On the other
hand, only 5% of successful spam proﬁles have zero followers
and about 1/3rd have less than 10. In comparison, nearly
40% of unsuccessful spam proﬁles have zero followers and a
total of 2/3rd have less than 10. Thomas et al. noted in their
work that 89% of spam proﬁles have less than 10 followers.
The contrast with our observations makes us believe that
not only have all spammers become smarter about acquiring
followers but also that the successful spammers fare better
in their follower counts. Focusing on the follower count of
the group of 2/3rd successful spam proﬁles that exclusively
used regular tweets (Figure 3), we note that the spam proﬁles
that use exclusively regular tweets maintain a large number
of followers, with almost 1/3rd of them having 100 or more
followers.
links (upon traversing all HTTP redirects for each URL) for
each proﬁle lead to the same domain name. This heuristic
ensures that we capture where these links lead while allowing
for host-name and directory-level variations in URLs, which
spammers often leverage to create distinct-looking links.
A total of 6,630 (86% of those with 10 links in our data)
spam proﬁles met our criterion and were leading their fol-
lowers to 559 diﬀerent domains. Two of the domains were
particularly noteworthy.
In the ﬁrst, the ﬁnal destination
was t.co, which is Twitter’s own URL shortener. Since
URL shorteners are never the destination page, we looked
up the destination pages manually and found that they were
Twitter’s warning pages, informing the visitor that the link
in the tweet was leading a malware-serving site. (The user
still has the option of clicking on the original destination.) A
total of 1,822 proﬁles led to a t.co warning page and clearly
contained one or more spam campaigns leading to malware.
The second interesting domain was where 1,741 proﬁles
were acting as Amazon aﬃliates because they were each
leading their targets to Amazon.com URLs similar to the one
shown in Figure 2. Thomas et al.’s work also found a large
number of aﬃliate spam. However, the spam tweets in their
data used mention tweets, while we ﬁnd spam proﬁles to be
using regular tweets instead, indicating a shift in strategy.
Almost all of the spam URLs had amzn.to as the starting
point landing page in tweets, which is bit.ly’s specialized
URL shortening service for Amazon. Amazon.com accounted
for over 55% of the 917,294 tweets by successful spam pro-
ﬁles, and contained a total of 76 unique Amazon aﬃliate
IDs.
In order to understand the diﬀerent Amazon.com cam-
paigns, we examined the aﬃliate IDs and the spam proﬁles
associated with them. All proﬁles using the same aﬃliate ID
were clearly part of the same campaign. Common proﬁles
across multiple aﬃliate IDs also implied that they belonged
to a spam campaign. We found 19 Amazon.com campaigns in
our data set where the spammers were using regular tweets
to target their followers. Table 3 shows the top ﬁve cam-
paigns where a spammer either used a large number of Twit-
ter proﬁles or aﬃliate IDs. The largest of these involved over
1.5K Twitter proﬁles and sent almost half a million tweets
over our data collection period.

Spam Campaigns
4.1.1
To gain insights into spam campaigns of spammers using
this strategy, we examine the regular tweets of all the 14,230
successful spam proﬁles. We only consider ones for which we
have at least 10 regular tweets with links in our data. The
cut-oﬀ ensures that we have suﬃcient tweets to judge the
nature of their campaigns. This cut oﬀ left us with 7,704
spam proﬁles.
In order to study the destinations of their
spam campaigns, we require that 80% of the ﬁnal destination

Spam Proﬁles Binned
4.1.2
Of the 14,230 successful spam proﬁles, 92.1% (12,979)
used regular tweets and 68.3% (9,723) used regular tweets
exclusively. The analysis in this section suggests that 6,630
spam proﬁles were targeting their own followers in their
spam campaigns.
It is noteworthy that of these, 93.6%
(6,208) were using regular tweets exclusively.
4.2 Spamming Followers of Popular Proﬁles
As an alternative to targeting one’s own followers, spam-
mers can ﬁnd suitable targets by simply targeting other pro-
ﬁles’ followers. This is advantageous in cases such as when,
say, a spammer wants to target music lovers. He/she can
send spam to the followers of music celebrities, leveraging
the fact that many of the celebrities have already acquired a
large number of followers. Targeting the followers of popular
proﬁles is in general an easy strategy a spammer can use,
even if the goal is not to target speciﬁc type of users. In fact,
softwares such as TweetAttacks [18] and TweetAdder [17]
have readily available automation spammers could exploit
to target followers of any proﬁle. Note that the tweets sent
using this strategy will have to make use of reply or men-
tion tweets since otherwise, they will only go to the proﬁle’s
followers.
A total of 4,086 (28.7%) spam proﬁles made use of reply
or mention tweets in our data. In order to determine how
many of them targeted followers of other proﬁles, we needed
to have at least a few samples of the users who received their
spam. We used a threshold of four unique Twitter users
receiving spam from a speciﬁc spam proﬁle and checked if
at least 50% of the targets for each spammer were following
the same proﬁle.
If so, the spammer likely targeted the
followers of that proﬁle.
Of the spammers that made use of reply or mention tweets,
3,528 (86.3%) had targeted at least four diﬀerent users in
their spam. For each spammer’s targets, we collected in-
formation about all proﬁles each target was following using
the Twitter API. However, since API calls are expensive,
we collected only the ﬁrst 5000 followings for each target.
When checking if at least 50% of the targets for each were
following a speciﬁc proﬁle, we found that 877 proﬁles ﬁt the
heuristic. They contributed an average of just under 23 re-
ply or mention tweets each, which is much lower than the
average of 64 tweets an average spam proﬁle in our data
contributed (see Table 1). This suggests that the volume of
spam from this strategy is not high. Examining the tweets
of this group of 877 spam proﬁles, only 272 had more than
10 reply or mention tweets with links. Of these, 225 proﬁles
had more than 80% of their links going to the same domain,
implying that these proﬁles were pointing their targets to a
speciﬁc domain and potentially running spam campaigns.
The most popular of these domains was hellojb.info,
which made up 18% (157) of the total 877 proﬁles and 18%
of the total reply or mention tweets from this group of spam-
mers. 149 of the proﬁles from this campaign used reply
tweets to target the followers of celebrity Justin Beiber with
the link that claimed to have some information on how to
get Justin Beiber to follow them.
The second most interesting domain was where six spam
proﬁles were acting as Amazon aﬃliates. Their tweets car-
ried four unique aﬃliate IDs, suggesting that there are up
to four spam campaigns here (see Table 4). Though of a
much smaller scale, these campaigns are of a similar nature
to the Amazon aﬃliates campaigns found in Section 4.1.
However, since none of the proﬁles or aﬃliate IDs here are
common with those found in Section 4.1, we believe that
the spammers behind these campaigns are a diﬀerent group
from those found in Section 4.1.

Spam Proﬁles Binned
4.2.1
A total of 877 spam proﬁles were binned under this strat-
egy. Of these, 26 were common with the 6,630 binned under
Section 4.1. These were clearly targeting their own followers
through regular tweets and others’ followers through reply
or mention tweets. Overall, thus far, we have binned 7,481
(52.5%) of the 14,230 proﬁles of successful spammers.
4.3 Spamming based on Keywords in Tweets
Spammers can also pick their targets based on the content
of tweets from Twitter users. For example, a spammer who
has a campaign revolving around phones may target users
who have used the term “phone” in their tweets. Finding
such targets is easy for spammers since Twitter already fa-
cilitates searching tweets based on keywords. In fact, that
softwares such as TweetAdder already support automating
this spamming strategy suggests that some spammers may
be making use of it.
Spammers using this strategy could use reply tweets or
mention tweets to send spam to their chosen targets. How-
ever,
looking at a mention tweet, one cannot determine
which speciﬁc tweet triggered a response from the spammer.
This rules out the scrutiny of 1,408 spam proﬁles that used
mention tweets but not reply tweets. Fortunately, it is pos-
sible to check for the use of this strategy when reply tweets
are used, since reply tweets contain an identiﬁer, status ID,
for the original tweets that were replied to.
2,969 successful spammers in our data (21% of 14,230)
made use of reply tweets, some in conjunction with other
types of tweets. In order to judge if a spam tweet contained a
keyword, we ﬁrst had to identify possible keywords. Towards
this goal, we used the term frequency-inverse document fre-
quency (TF-IDF [8]) statistic which reﬂects how important
a word is to a document in a collection. Upon computing
the TF-IDF score of about 7 million words present in the
tweets from successful spammers, we picked the top 50K as
possible keywords. Then for each reply tweet of each spam
proﬁle that had at least three reply tweets, we extracted
the source tweets (tweets they were replied to) by using the
status ID present in the tweets and querying the Twitter
API. In the next step, we looked for common keywords in
source tweets for the each spam proﬁle. If a word appeared
in over a percentage threshold of a spam proﬁle’s tweets and
was one of the 50K words we chose as keywords, we took it
to imply that the spammer targeted authors of tweets with
393
speciﬁc keywords. Since we had varying number of source
tweets for each spammer, we used four slabs to judge if a
spam proﬁle was using this strategy to ﬁnd targets. For the
