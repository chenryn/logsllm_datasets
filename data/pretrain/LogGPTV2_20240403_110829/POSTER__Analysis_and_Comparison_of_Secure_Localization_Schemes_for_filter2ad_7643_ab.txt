of security as with traditional removable SIMs. See http://www.
gsma.com/connectedliving/embedded-sim/. 
Figure 1 shows the eUICC Subscription Manager architecture. 
Operators use the Data Preparation entity to securely encrypt 
their operator credentials for over the air installation within the 
SIM. The Secure Routing entity delivers the encrypted operator 
credentials to the SIM and remotely manages the SIM thereafter 
to enable, disable and delete the credentials as necessary during 
the product’s lifetime. Use of the eUICC could minimise some of 
the security problems outlined in section 3.2.

The SM-SR ensures the secure transport of both 
eUICC platform and eUICC proﬁle management 
commands in order to load, enable, disable and 
delete proﬁles on the eUICC.
The GSMA Embedded SIM provides tremendous benefits to 
OEMs, including late-stage provisioning during manufacture and 
remote provisioning over the air. Additionally benefits for the 
whole supply chain include reduced costs in handling M2M SIM 
products and low integration and testing costs and all this with 
minimal impact to existing systems and network infrastructure.
The eUICC provides new business opportunities for Transport 
operators and Mobile Network Operators, reducing logistical 
and operational costs but retaining existing SIM security levels, 
with minimal impact to the network infrastructure. 
The eUICC supports multiple SIM profiles and can also be used 
with removable M2M SIMs – This would enable, for example, 
a vehicle may have its infotainment provided via one mobile 
operator and its remote engine monitoring by another.

In the UK, cloud computing is being increasingly used by Local 
Authorities, including in transport applications. For example 
the “National traffic disruptions hub” in the UK has been 
cloud-based since 2003, evolving from a road-works database. 
The objective is to unite 175 Local Authorities on a common 
platform for road-works, incidents and other disruptions. 
Dynamic traffic management information is provided by 40 
UK Local Authorities, and is linked to the UTMC (Urban Traffic 
Management and Control) systems to give a single integrated 
view of traffic management information. The data is widely 
disseminated, including to Google, Here (Nokia Navteq), and 
TomTom. 
As pointed out by the GSMA (2013a), making use of cloud-
based or managed smart city services, billed on a pay-as-you-
go basis, is likely to be more cost-effective than deploying the 
city’s own dedicated infrastructure. 
1.3 Smart phones
Although smartphones have a history going back to the mid-
1990s with the Nokia 9000, they really took off in the mid-2000s 
with the Blackberry, the Apple iPhone and the Google Android 
operating system. They have continued to gain in computing 
power, connectivity (Wi-Fi and Near Field Communications (NFC) 
as well as cellular), screen size and resolution, and sensor facilities 
(cameras, GNSS positioning, motion-sensing) – and this trend 
seems set to continue for the foreseeable future.  
This ubiquity, power and versatility of smart-phones, as sensor 
platforms and as generators of useful data, is driving applications 
in commerce, financial services, infotainment and many other 
areas, including transport.
1.4 Cloud-based computing
In Cloud-based computing, data, applications, services and 
infrastructure are provided in “the Cloud”, hosted on remote 
infrastructure, available from anywhere. The advantages are: 
■■ Highly scalable implementation; the cloud 
operator can support sudden changes in 
computational requirements.
■■ The Cloud operator handles back-up and software 
upgrades, with resulting economies of scale.
■■ All users can access the latest data.
■■ Terminals & user devices can be of lower 
computing power.
■■ There is less need for specialist IT skills in the 
organisation, and no need to understand how the 
service is provided.
■■ There is no need for large capital outlay; resources 
can be provided on a “pay as you go” basis.

2  Intelligent Mobility and C-ITS
There are Intelligent Mobility and Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) 
programmes world-wide, with wireless data exchange from vehicle 
to infrastructure (V2I) or vehicle to vehicle (V2V). C-ITS includes 
technologies and applications that allow wireless data exchange 
within the transport system, between vehicles (V2V), and between 
vehicles and infrastructure (V2I), but also covers vulnerable road 
users such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. 
“Connected cars” and “autonomous vehicles” are “hot topics” 
globally due to converging interests of mobile operators, 
automotive companies and ITS organisations, influenced by 
developments in consumer electronics (In in January 2015 the 
keynote addresses at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show 
were given by the Chairmen of Mercedes and Ford, and the show 
featured self-driving cars from Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW).
Priorities of the US Department of Transportation’s “ITS Strategic 
Plan 2015-2019” are: “Realising connected vehicle implementation 
and advancing automation”. Autonomous vehicles have now 
entered public and political consciousness – largely due to the 
Google self-driving car. 
The term “Intelligent Mobility” has gained currency, particularly 
amongst automobile manufacturers.  The key to Intelligent 
Mobility is to connect a range of independent industries 
and technologies such as vehicle manufacturing, transport 
information systems, communications technologies, logistics and 
distribution and infrastructure management.
The European Commission has decided to take a more 
prominent role in the deployment of cooperative systems. To 
that end, DG MOVE (the Directorate General for Transport 
and Mobility) is setting up a C-ITS Deployment Platform, a 
cooperative framework including national authorities and other 
stakeholders, aiming to develop a roadmap and a deployment 
strategy for C-ITS in the EU and identify potential solutions to 
cross-cutting issues, by the end of 2015. 
There are 200 million vehicles on European roads and some 13 
million jobs in the automotive industry, so Europe would like to 
be in the lead in introducing new technologies. But connected 
cars need common technical specifications, including radio 
frequencies and message formats. CEN and ETSI are currently 
preparing a coherent set of standards, specifications and 
guidelines to support implementation and deployment of C-ITS 
across Europe. For more information, please see  
http://release1.its-standards.eu/ 
2.1 The connected car
Connected vehicles can communicate with each other and their 
surroundings. They are equipped with internet access, cellular radio, 
radar and other communication links including DSRC and an internal 
wireless local area network, allowing internet access to other devices 
both inside and outside the vehicle. Benefits to the driver include 
prevention or automatic notification of crashes, speeding and 
congestion. Increasingly, connected cars use smartphone apps to 
interact with the car from any distance. Users can unlock their cars, 
check the status of batteries on electric cars, find the location of the 
car, or remotely activate the climate control system. 
As indicated earlier, the market size for the connected car is 
expected to increase dramatically. According to the GSMA 
(2013c) the global connected car market will be worth €39 billion 
in 2018, up from €13 billion in 2012. There will be a sevenfold 
increase in the number of new cars equipped with factory-
fitted mobile connectivity to meet demand among regulators 
and consumers for safety and security features, as well as 
infotainment and navigation. This rapid growth will be driven in 
part by positive regulatory action in Europe, Russia and Brazil.

Connected vehicle technology includes the following:
■■ Fleet telematics allows emergency services and 
commercial fleet operators to increase utilisation 
factors for their vehicles, improve driving standards 
and fuel efficiency, reducing emissions and vehicle 
wear.
■■ Links to infrastructure systems which manage 
traffic flows on roads, including Urban Traffic 
Management & Control, roadside Variable Message 
Signs to inform drivers of reduced speed limits, 
traffic jams and other safety messages.
■■ Communication with public transport measures 
including selective vehicle detection, traffic light 
control and real time passenger information.
■■ Vehicle to Vehicle systems (V2V), where vehicles 
interact with each other using wireless networks, 
sending information about weather, speed, 
location, direction of travel, braking, and loss of 
stability, typically using Dedicated Short-Range 
Communications (DSRC) at 5.8 or 5.9 GHz,  and/or 
a mesh radio network.
■■ Vehicle to Infrastructure systems (V2I) allow wider 
area dissemination of traffic and safety information, 
as well as vehicle tracking and recovery, emergency 
call (e-Call), the set-up of WiFi and 3G hot-spots, 
reservation of and guidance to parking spaces. 
Telefónica has an agreement with Tesla to supply connectivity 
for its in-car infotainment system and remote vehicle diagnostics, 
in Germany, the UK and Spain. http://www.gsma.com/
connectedliving/telefonica-tesla-agreement/. 
2.2  Driver support and Intelligent Speed  
Adaptation (ISA)
This includes:
■■ ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), 
including collision avoidance which support 
the driving task by reducing work-load and 
raising awareness of risk. It can be autonomous 
(contained within the vehicle) or cooperative by 
interfacing to other vehicles and to infrastructure.
■■ Autonomous Cruise Control (ACC)
■■ Crash avoidance and Black Box recorders
■■ Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) – advice on 
or control of vehicle speed and driver advisories. 
There has been much research on ISA, especially 
in Sweden, Australia and the UK, including a 
large-scale trial in London, but the transition to 
wide commercial use still hasn’t happened. It may 
come about through the widespread availability of 
smartphones, coupled with the increasing interest 
in Usage-based Insurance (UBI). Also it is being 
subsumed into and replaced by the connected car 
and “autonomous vehicles”.
2.3 Autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars
Self-driving cars are one of the hottest of current hot topics. 
Research has been carried out in the US, Western Europe and 
Asia-Pacific for decades, but the topic has now entered the public 
and political consciousness – largely due to the Google self-
driving car.
Autonomous vehicles sense their surroundings using radar, LIDAR 
(Light Detection And Ranging – like radar but using light instead 
of microwaves), GPS, and computer vision, and can navigate 
without human input. Advanced control systems interpret 
sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as 
well as obstacles and relevant signage. Autonomous vehicles can 
update their maps based on sensory input, allowing the vehicles 
to keep track of their position even when conditions change. 
Autonomous vehicles exist mainly as prototypes and 
demonstration systems. However, as of early 2015, there are 
self-driving vehicles that are commercially available; these are 
open-air slow-speed shuttles for use in pedestrianised zones, 
though many countries are gearing up to run trials and to amend 
legislation to permit driverless cars on their roads.

3  Enforcement and security
“Enforcement” covers topics such as detection of toll evaders, bus 
lane and red light running, speed cameras, crime detection and 
security. A related topic is “vehicle classification systems” (because 
tolls may be dependent on vehicle size and other characteristics). 
One hot topic is “average speed zones”, where speed limits are 
enforced by cameras in a road corridor or area, rather than at a 
single point, with proven safety benefits. By definition, such zones 
need communications between cameras, or to a control centre, in 
contrast to the “Gatso” spot-speed cameras.
3.1 Enforcement technology
Technologies involved include Automatic Number-Plate/License 
Plate Recognition (ANPR/ALPR), which is used to recognise and 
identify vehicles. There are many suppliers of this technology, 
which is a very computing and electronics-intensive topic – and is 
being increasingly used in the US in “video tolling” – see section 5.
3.2 Networking & security in vehicles
An important topic in many areas, not just in transport.  Homeland 
Security continues to be of importance in ITS, especially in the US 
but also more widely. The UK and the US have just entered into a 
joint agreement to collaborate on this topic. There are concerns 
about protecting infrastructure, and about the susceptibility 
of autonomous and connected vehicles to hacking and cyber 
terrorism.  Chinese students recently hacked a Tesla electric car 
and opened its doors while it was on the road; US researchers 
have demonstrated a cyber attack on Toyota Prius and Ford 
Escape vehicles which could affect steering and braking; but these 
incidents were in research and test environments; no such attacks 
have been reported in the “real world” – as yet.
Concerns about these issues have reached the highest levels, 
including the World Economic Forum. Its Global Risks 2015 report 
identified the increasing potential for digital attacks on cars. 
The GSMA believes that mobile operators are well-placed to 
contribute to automotive cyber security due to their expertise in 
authentication and security and emerging technologies such as the 
eUICC.
The GSMA are developing IoT security guidelines to ensure best 
practice for the secure connection and management of IoT devices 
on any mobile network. A unified and robust approach to security 
will create a trusted, reliable environment that can scale as the 
market grows. The security guidelines will be out of comment in 
October 2015 and final release in February 2016.

4 Fleet Management,  
  PayAsYouDrive Insurance  
  & Parking
Fleet management includes optimal routing, and monitoring of 
vehicle health and driving style. At least 80% of freight traffic 
by weight – more by value - travels by road; it is vital to national 
economies. The fleet management markets in Europe, Russia/
CIS and China have annual growth rates of 14%, 16% and 23% 
respectively. Penetration will reach 20% by 2019. GPRS meets the key 
parameters of area coverage, network latency and data bandwidth 
and 3G/4G technologies will bring increased uplink speeds and 
reduced latency, improving the consumer experience and creating 
opportunities for the ITS ecosystem. 
Pay As You Drive Insurance (PAYDI – aka Usage-Based 
Insurance - UBI) is an expanding field, doubling annually in some 
cases, as insurance companies reduce costs and acquire more 
sophisticated tools to categorise drivers, using “dongles” with 
GPS receiver and SIM card in the vehicle OBD, or smartphone 
apps.  
Helping drivers find parking spaces minimises congestion and 
pollution. Charges can be sent wirelessly to meters. Motorists can 
pay from their mobile. Many cities use SMS for parking charges in 
the US, Europe, Australia and United Arab Emirates. 
4.1 Fleet management
Fleet management refers to haulage companies, car hire 
organisations, emergency services, breakdown/rescue services 
and others managing their vehicle fleets, including optimal 
routing, monitoring of vehicle health and driving style. It has been 
used for 40 years, though in the past it may have necessitated 
an organisation having its own mobile radio network. But the 
availability of ubiquitous and affordable mobile communications, 
satellite location systems, the significantly reduced cost of in-
vehicle equipment, and the wish to maximise productivity and 
customer service while minimising environmental pollution, 
means that it is an expanding marketplace.

Most freight traffic travels by road rather than by rail – typically 
85% according to official statistics, which are usually based 
on tonne-kilometres – but in terms of value the road freight 
proportion tends to be higher since much rail freight is low value 
bulk material. Hence road freight is vital to national economies – 
it has been estimated that 15% of the cost of everything we buy is 
a transport cost. 
Fleet Management in China
Commercial vehicle fleets are essential to the Chinese economy 
and its future development. Road transport represents 75% of 
the freight total by weight - around 31 billion tonnes in 2013. 
There were almost 17.9 million vehicles in 2011, plus 2.5 million 
buses.  Berg Insight expects steep growth in the Chinese 
market, and renewal of the vehicle fleet to combat pollution. 
Fleet management systems will grow at 22.9% annually, from
