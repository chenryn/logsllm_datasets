### Security and the eUICC
The eUICC (Embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card) offers a level of security comparable to traditional removable SIMs. For more information, visit [GSMA Embedded SIM](http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/embedded-sim/).

**Figure 1: eUICC Subscription Manager Architecture**

- **Subscription Manager – Data Preparation (SM-DP):**
  The SM-DP securely packages profiles for provisioning on the eUICC. It manages the installation of these profiles onto the eUICC.

- **Subscription Manager – Secure Routing (SM-SR):**
  The SM-SR ensures the secure transport of eUICC platform and profile management commands, enabling the loading, enabling, disabling, and deletion of profiles on the eUICC.

- **eUICC:**
  The eUICC can store multiple SIM profiles and can be used with removable M2M SIMs. This flexibility allows, for example, a vehicle to use one mobile operator for infotainment and another for remote engine monitoring.

- **Operator and Manufacturer:**
  Operators use the Data Preparation entity to securely encrypt their credentials for over-the-air installation within the SIM. The Secure Routing entity then delivers these encrypted credentials to the SIM and remotely manages the SIM throughout the product's lifecycle.

The eUICC can help mitigate some of the security issues outlined in section 3.2 by providing robust, over-the-air management capabilities.

### Benefits of the eUICC
The GSMA Embedded SIM offers significant benefits to OEMs, including late-stage provisioning during manufacture and remote provisioning over the air. These benefits extend to the entire supply chain, reducing costs associated with handling M2M SIM products and integration, while minimizing the impact on existing systems and network infrastructure.

For Transport operators and Mobile Network Operators, the eUICC presents new business opportunities by reducing logistical and operational costs while maintaining existing SIM security levels. The minimal impact on network infrastructure makes it an attractive solution.

### Cloud Computing in the UK
In the UK, cloud computing is increasingly being adopted by Local Authorities, particularly in transport applications. For example, the "National Traffic Disruptions Hub" has been cloud-based since 2003, evolving from a road-works database. The objective is to unite 175 Local Authorities on a common platform for road-works, incidents, and other disruptions. Dynamic traffic management information is provided by 40 UK Local Authorities and is linked to the UTMC (Urban Traffic Management and Control) systems, offering a single integrated view of traffic management information. This data is widely disseminated, including to Google, Here (Nokia Navteq), and TomTom.

According to the GSMA (2013a), using cloud-based or managed smart city services, billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, is likely to be more cost-effective than deploying dedicated infrastructure.

### Smartphones
Although smartphones have a history dating back to the mid-1990s with the Nokia 9000, they gained widespread adoption in the mid-2000s with the Blackberry, Apple iPhone, and Google Android operating system. Smartphones have continued to advance in computing power, connectivity (Wi-Fi, NFC, and cellular), screen size and resolution, and sensor capabilities (cameras, GNSS positioning, motion-sensing). This trend is expected to continue, driving applications in commerce, financial services, infotainment, and many other areas, including transport.

### Cloud-Based Computing
Cloud-based computing provides data, applications, services, and infrastructure in "the Cloud," hosted on remote infrastructure and accessible from anywhere. The advantages include:

- **Highly Scalable Implementation:** The cloud operator can support sudden changes in computational requirements.
- **Efficient Back-up and Upgrades:** The cloud operator handles back-ups and software upgrades, achieving economies of scale.
- **Access to Latest Data:** All users can access the most recent data.
- **Lower-Power Terminals:** User devices can have lower computing power.
- **Reduced IT Skills Requirement:** There is less need for specialist IT skills in the organization, and no need to understand how the service is provided.
- **Pay-As-You-Go Model:** No large capital outlay is required; resources can be provided on a "pay as you go" basis.

### Intelligent Mobility and C-ITS
Intelligent Mobility and Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) programs are being implemented worldwide, facilitating wireless data exchange between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I). C-ITS includes technologies and applications that allow wireless data exchange within the transport system, covering vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.

#### Connected Cars and Autonomous Vehicles
Connected cars and autonomous vehicles are global hot topics, driven by the converging interests of mobile operators, automotive companies, and ITS organizations. Keynote addresses at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in January 2015 featured self-driving cars from Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW.

The US Department of Transportation’s "ITS Strategic Plan 2015-2019" prioritizes connected vehicle implementation and advancing automation. Autonomous vehicles have entered public and political consciousness, largely due to the Google self-driving car.

#### European Commission Initiatives
The European Commission is taking a more prominent role in the deployment of cooperative systems. DG MOVE (Directorate General for Transport and Mobility) is setting up a C-ITS Deployment Platform, a cooperative framework involving national authorities and other stakeholders. The goal is to develop a roadmap and deployment strategy for C-ITS in the EU by the end of 2015, addressing cross-cutting issues. With 200 million vehicles on European roads and 13 million jobs in the automotive industry, Europe aims to lead in introducing new technologies. Common technical specifications, including radio frequencies and message formats, are being prepared by CEN and ETSI to support C-ITS implementation across Europe. For more information, see [ITS Standards](http://release1.its-standards.eu/).

#### Connected Car Features
Connected vehicles can communicate with each other and their surroundings, equipped with internet access, cellular radio, radar, and other communication links, including DSRC and an internal wireless local area network. Benefits to drivers include crash prevention, automatic notification, and congestion reduction. Connected cars also use smartphone apps to interact with the car from any distance, allowing users to unlock their cars, check battery status, find the car's location, or remotely activate the climate control system.

The market for connected cars is expected to grow significantly. According to the GSMA (2013c), the global connected car market will be worth €39 billion in 2018, up from €13 billion in 2012. This growth is driven by demand for safety, security, infotainment, and navigation features, as well as positive regulatory action in Europe, Russia, and Brazil.

### Driver Support and Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA)
Driver support and ISA include:

- **ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems):** These systems, including collision avoidance, reduce workload and raise awareness of risks. They can be autonomous or cooperative, interfacing with other vehicles and infrastructure.
- **Autonomous Cruise Control (ACC):** Maintains a set speed and distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Crash Avoidance and Black Box Recorders:** Enhance safety and provide data for accident analysis.
- **Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA):** Provides advice or control of vehicle speed and driver advisories. Research on ISA has been extensive, but wide commercial use is still pending. The increasing availability of smartphones and interest in Usage-based Insurance (UBI) may drive its adoption.

### Autonomous Vehicles
Self-driving cars are a current hot topic, with research conducted in the US, Western Europe, and Asia-Pacific for decades. The Google self-driving car has brought the topic into public and political consciousness. Autonomous vehicles use radar, LIDAR, GPS, and computer vision to navigate without human input. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, obstacles, and signage. Autonomous vehicles can update their maps based on sensory input, allowing them to track their position even when conditions change. While primarily prototypes and demonstration systems, some low-speed, open-air shuttles for pedestrianized zones are commercially available. Many countries are preparing to run trials and amend legislation to permit driverless cars on their roads.

### Enforcement and Security
Enforcement in ITS covers topics such as toll evasion, bus lane and red light running, speed cameras, crime detection, and security. Vehicle classification systems are also relevant, as tolls may depend on vehicle size and characteristics. Average speed zones, where speed limits are enforced over a road corridor rather than at a single point, offer proven safety benefits. Such zones require communications between cameras or to a control center.

#### Enforcement Technology
Technologies like Automatic Number-Plate/License Plate Recognition (ANPR/ALPR) are used to recognize and identify vehicles. This technology is highly computing and electronics-intensive and is increasingly used in the US for video tolling.

#### Networking and Security in Vehicles
Vehicle networking and security are critical, especially in transport. Homeland Security remains a key concern, with the UK and US entering a joint agreement to collaborate on this topic. Concerns about protecting infrastructure and the susceptibility of autonomous and connected vehicles to hacking and cyber terrorism are growing. Incidents, such as Chinese students hacking a Tesla and US researchers demonstrating a cyber attack on Toyota Prius and Ford Escape, highlight these risks, though these were in research and test environments. The World Economic Forum's Global Risks 2015 report identified the increasing potential for digital attacks on cars. The GSMA believes mobile operators are well-placed to contribute to automotive cybersecurity due to their expertise in authentication and security. The GSMA is developing IoT security guidelines to ensure best practices for secure connection and management of IoT devices on any mobile network. These guidelines will be released for comment in October 2015 and finalized in February 2016.

### Fleet Management, Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance, and Parking
Fleet management involves optimal routing and monitoring of vehicle health and driving style. At least 80% of freight traffic by weight (more by value) travels by road, making it vital to national economies. The fleet management markets in Europe, Russia/CIS, and China are growing at annual rates of 14%, 16%, and 23%, respectively, with penetration expected to reach 20% by 2019. GPRS, 3G, and 4G technologies meet key parameters for area coverage, network latency, and data bandwidth, improving the consumer experience and creating opportunities for the ITS ecosystem.

**Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance (PAYDI/UBI):** This field is expanding, with insurance companies reducing costs and using more sophisticated tools to categorize drivers through GPS dongles or smartphone apps.

**Parking Solutions:** Helping drivers find parking spaces minimizes congestion and pollution. Charges can be sent wirelessly to meters, and motorists can pay via their mobile devices. Many cities in the US, Europe, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates use SMS for parking charges.

### Fleet Management
Fleet management refers to the management of vehicle fleets by haulage companies, car hire organizations, emergency services, and breakdown/rescue services. It includes optimal routing, monitoring of vehicle health, and driving style. While fleet management has been in use for 40 years, the availability of ubiquitous and affordable mobile communications, satellite location systems, and reduced costs of in-vehicle equipment have expanded the marketplace. Most freight traffic travels by road, making it vital to national economies, with an estimated 15% of the cost of everything we buy attributed to transport.

**Fleet Management in China:**
Commercial vehicle fleets are essential to the Chinese economy and its future development. Road transport represents 75% of the freight total by weight, around 31 billion tonnes in 2013. With almost 17.9 million vehicles and 2.5 million buses in 2011, Berg Insight expects steep growth in the Chinese market, driven by the renewal of the vehicle fleet to combat pollution. Fleet management systems are expected to grow at an annual rate of 22.9%.
