User: When I run ./manage.py, I get the following error,
from: can't read /var/mail/os.path
./manage.py: line 4: import: command not found
./manage.py: line 7: syntax error near unexpected token `0,'
./manage.py: line 7: `sys.path.insert( 0, abspath( join( dirname( file ), 'external_apps' ) ) )'
What is it!!! How can I resolve it?
Assistant: Do not add #!/usr/bin/python . Use virtualenv and activate it before running python manage.py your_command . When you will be familiar with virtualenv try virtualenvwrapper.
