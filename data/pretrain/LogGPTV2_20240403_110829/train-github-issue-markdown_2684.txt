**Issue Details:**
- **Electron Version:** 8.2.1
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Last Known Working Electron Version:** Unknown

**Expected Behavior:**
The application should not crash.

**Actual Behavior:**
When attempting to launch the Electron application via a web trigger, an error is encountered:

```
However, when the application is installed and launched by double-clicking, it works as expected.
