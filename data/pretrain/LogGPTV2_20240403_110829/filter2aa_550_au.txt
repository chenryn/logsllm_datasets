Figure 11. “Total Influence” Matrix T.
The indirect influences not only transform the matrix, but also transform our under-
standing of the nature of the system. Indirect influences are “feedback” influences, 
which allow each factor to influence every other factor in the system, and over time, 
to influence even itself.
460 The DEMATEL formula here is T=D * (E-D)^-1, where E is the identity matrix.
Analyzing Total Influence
Based on DEMATEL-calculated indirect influences, Fig. 12 reveals a more complete 
picture of cause and effect, based on the “total influence” of each factor within the 
system.

Figure 12. Initial Total Influence Index.
The combined direct and indirect “total influence” calculation yields an alternative 
ranking of the factors. Here, the top four are the same factors identified in the causal 
loop diagram as having the highest number of very influential relationships with 
other factors, regardless of whether the influence was given or received.
Anonymity is still the most important factor in the system. However, the addition of 
indirect influence scores reorders other factors in the list. Inadequate cyber defense 
and military doctrine surpassed IT vulnerabilities and asymmetry in importance 
(compared to Fig. 6), while deterrence and arms control gained influence at the ex-
pense of non-state actors and IPv6.
The final step of this DEMATEL analysis subtracts the indirect influences from the 
direct influences in Fig. 12 to create a final normalized total influence index, which 
is shown in Fig. 13.

After this final calculation, the overall ranking by factor returns closer to the origi-
nal direct influence ranking in Fig. 6. In fact, the order of the cyber attack advan-
tages is unchanged, as seen in Fig. 14.

Figure 14. Cyber Attack Advantage Summary.
However, there is now a much larger statistical gap between the two most impor-
tant factors, anonymity and IT vulnerabilities, and the third and fourth place cyber 
attack advantages, asymmetry and inadequate cyber defense. Non-state actors re-
ceived a negative overall score in the final index, which indicates that this concept is 
a net receiver, and not provider, of influence in the system of strategic cyber security 
today.
The movement of the mitigation strategies in the final index is much more striking. 
Fig. 15 reveals that all four strategies moved in the list, especially IPv6, which was 
the only factor in the system to move more than one place in the overall ranking
