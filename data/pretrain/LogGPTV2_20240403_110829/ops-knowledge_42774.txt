User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题iptables doesn't recognize --log-prefix I'm having difficulty getting iptables to log.  Here are the relevant commands:

/usr/sbin/iptables -N LOG_DROP
/usr/sbin/iptables -A LOG_DROP -m limit --limit 2/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables drop: " --log-level 7
/usr/sbin/iptables -A LOG_DROP -j DROP


Entering these commands, results in:


  iptables v1.4.21: unknown option "--log-prefix"


I believe the following modules are important, so they're active in my kernel:

`nf_log_common
 nf_log_ipv4
 nf_log_ipv6`


Any suggestions for solving this problem?

Assistant: I had to run all commands with root privileges (sudo). Obviously iptables command executed by user didn't know about the channel created by root.
