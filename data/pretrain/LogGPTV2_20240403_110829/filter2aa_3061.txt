Ben, I think Copilot 
is out to get me!
I need help!

Hey Brendan… you know software security…?
Let’s do some 
experiments and prove it

●
Copilot (and other large language models) are probabilistic
●
Observed good tendency for functional correctness

But ‘correct’ code can be exploitable!

1.
Diversity of Weakness: 
○
What is the incidence rate of diﬀerent types of vulnerability?
2.
Diversity of Prompt:
○
Do changes to prompt change the rate of vulnerabilities?
3.
Diversity of Domain:
○
Do these discoveries hold outside of the software domain? 
Three dimensions to investigate

1.
“Valid”

2.
“Vulnerable”
○
The number of runnable suggestions containing the CWE
3.
“Top Suggestion”

Was the “First” runnable suggestion (the one you see) safe?
