I have not had a chance to test this under other conditions yet, but i suspect
it may affect other non mod_rewrite url rewriting modules, and does not happen
with path info based routing, nor when a bundle:controller:action style path
is given.
given the twig snippet:
    {% render url('some_partial') %}
the sub request to handle the render tag seems to ignore the uri passed to it
and use UNENCODED_URL instead, this continues round and round until the stack
gets too big and it errors.
from a really quick look it appears to be a conflict in how
Request::prepareRequestUri retrieves the uri and how Request::create creates
it, along with the fact DefaultRenderingStratergy::createSubRequest passes
through the original server array.
Off the top of my head a solution might be to check for a SYMFONY_URI
environment variable above all else and set that in create method, this would
ensure the frameworks value is always honoured.
