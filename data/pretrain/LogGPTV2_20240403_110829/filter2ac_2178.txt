**ATT&CK ID:** S0056  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Share Discovery (Net Crawler)

**Description:**
The Net Crawler technique involves the use of Windows administrative shares to establish authenticated sessions with remote systems over the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This method is commonly employed as part of lateral movement within a network, allowing attackers to discover and access shared resources on other machines. [38]

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** Lateral movement and network reconnaissance.
- **Protocol Used:** SMB (Server Message Block).
- **Target:** Remote systems with accessible administrative shares.

This technique leverages the built-in administrative shares (e.g., `C$`, `D$`, etc.) to gain access to and interact with files and directories on remote systems, facilitating further exploitation and movement within the network.
