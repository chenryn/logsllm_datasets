    The function isDomainName actually check that its argument is a valid HOST name, not
    that it is a valid DOMAIN name. (URLs use host names, for instance, but not all
    protocols do. See RFC 2181, section 11, for a discussion of the difference) Legitimate
    domain names like _jabber._tcp.gmail.com yield false.
    This is related to bug #1167 but it seems there is no way in the bug tracker to reopen a
    closed bug.
