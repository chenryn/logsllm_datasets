User: Please describe in detail the function and principle of network traffic monitoring, and how to detect abnormal traffic in the network.
Assistant: The function of network traffic monitoring is to monitor the data flow on the network, analyze and record the traffic, so that administrators can understand the usage of the network, detect and respond to abnormal conditions. Its principle is to understand the usage of the network by collecting network data packets and analyzing their related information. Traffic monitoring software can use different ways to collect network packets, such as using mirrored ports, sniffers or proxy servers, etc. Monitoring software processes and analyzes collected network data so that administrators can understand network usage and be able to identify and respond to anomalies. To detect abnormal traffic in the network, monitoring software needs to use predefined rules and policies to analyze network traffic and generate alerts or take other responsive actions. For example, monitoring software can detect large amounts of request or response traffic, specific IP address traffic, or traffic with malicious intent, etc., and alert them. Administrators can use this information to investigate potential attacks, including DDoS attacks, port scans, malware, and more. Therefore, network traffic monitoring is very important, which can help administrators understand the status of the network, improve network security, and quickly identify and respond to potential security threats.
