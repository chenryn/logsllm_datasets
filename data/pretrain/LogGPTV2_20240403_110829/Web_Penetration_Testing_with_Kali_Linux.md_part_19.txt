# Penetration Test Executive Report

## Regulatory and Compliance Standards

- **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**: FISMA and NIST Special Publications 800-153 and 800-137 provide a comprehensive framework to ensure the effectiveness of information security controls over resources supporting federal operations and assets.
- **North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)**: NERC has developed mandatory Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) cybersecurity standards, approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to protect critical cyber assets that control or affect the reliability of North American bulk electric systems. Compliance with these standards is mandatory for all organizations involved in the country's bulk electrical network.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS)**: These standards are designed for organizations handling cardholder information for major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM, and POS cards.
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**: SOX mandates strict reforms to improve financial disclosures from corporations and prevent accounting fraud.

## Professional Services Billing Strategies

### Turnkey
- **Definition**: A fixed-cost model where all services have a set price, which can only be adjusted if additional services are requested outside the agreed scope of work.
- **Risk**: The service provider bears the risk of losing profitability, as the cost does not change regardless of the amount of labor required.
- **Benefits**: Customers can plan for expected costs and hold service providers accountable for completing tasks without incurring additional labor costs.
- **Best Practices**: Define an achievable scope of work with some padding for unforeseen incidents.

### Time and Materials
- **Definition**: A billing method where the customer is charged for the hours used, with different hourly rates for various roles (e.g., Project Manager at $100/hour, Senior Engineer at $200/hour).
- **Risk**: The customer bears the risk of high costs if the project exceeds the estimated hours.
- **Benefits**: Customers may spend less if they can perform some of the work themselves and avoid the extra padding hours charged in a Turnkey proposal.
- **Downsides**: The service provider may not be incentivized to complete the project efficiently.

### Recommendations
- **Turnkey Services**: Develop well-defined practices to set proper expectations and avoid under-scoping.
- **Customer Requests**: Avoid replacing billable members with customer staff, as it introduces resource management risks and can lead to excessive hours and reduced profits.

## Documentation

### Stages of Deliverable Development
1. **Project Review**: Review the statement of work, business objectives, areas of concern, and proposed value to build a report template.
2. **Information Collection**: Fill in the report template with identified devices, processes, vulnerabilities, verification, suggested remediation, and other data.
3. **First Draft**: Prepare a non-customer-facing draft with as much data as possible.
4. **Review**: Finalize the report, ensuring it meets both executive and technical staff requirements.

### Document Lifecycle
- **Scope of Work**: Include hours needed for documentation, typically 60% for the draft and the remaining for review and sign-off.
- **Report Format**: Ensure all documents explain their purpose, advertise your brand, identify parties involved, list performed work, and conclude with expected results.

### Cover Page
- **Minimum Requirements**: Report name, version, date, author, service provider name, and intended party.
- **Additional Items**: Document security classification, highlights from other sections.

### Confidentiality Statement
- **Purpose**: Identify the level of security expected to protect captured information and specify who is authorized to view it.
- **Content**: Level of security, authorized viewers, copying and distribution rights, and legal language.
- **Example**:
  ```
  This document contains confidential and privileged information from [SERVICE PROVIDER]. The information is intended for the private use of [CUSTOMER] for their understanding of the current state of security of their organization. By accepting this document, [CUSTOMER] agrees to keep the contents of this document in confidence and not copy, disclose, or distribute it to any parties, other than those that will provide services and/or products directly to [CUSTOMER] as a result of the recommendations of this document, without written request to and written confirmation from [SERVICE PROVIDER].
  ```

### Document Control
- **Versioning**: List versions and edits made, including dates and types of modifications.

### Timeline
- **Phases**: Include phase names, tasks, and expected durations.
- **Mandatory Phases**: Clearly state which phases are mandatory to avoid requests to remove critical stages.

### Executive Summary
- **Purpose**: Provide a high-level overview of why services were performed, the problematic situation, and the proposed solution.
- **Audience**: Target leadership rather than technical staff.
- **Example**:
  ```
  [CUSTOMER] engaged [SERVICE PROVIDER] to conduct a vulnerability assessment and Penetration Test of its systems. The purpose was to assess the security of [CUSTOMER]'s networks and systems by identifying potential security flaws. The project was conducted on [DATE OF ENGAGEMENT] and included testing nine (9) internal hosts.
  ```

### Methodology
- **Overview**: Describe the process for each phase, tools used, and threat handling.
- **Certifications**: Highlight relevant certifications such as ISO 9001, CEH, and GPEN.
- **Example**:
  ```
  [SERVICE PROVIDER] used custom and publicly available tools to gain a hacker's perspective on the network's security posture. The methods provided [CUSTOMER] with an understanding of the risks and the strengths and weaknesses of current controls.
  ```

### Detailed Testing Procedures
- **Content**: Targets discovery, mapping, vulnerability assessment, architecture analysis, exploiting, and reporting.
- **Example**:
  ```
  [SERVICE PROVIDER] accessed the Legacy EMR host using default system administrator credentials for MS SQL, creating an administrator account and exposing system processes, user accounts, and database files.
  ```

### Summary of Findings
- **Purpose**: Explain the findings and their potential impact on the business.
- **Best Practices**: Include a risk ranking, summary charts, and detailed sections on individually identified items. Reference public sources to validate claims.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your penetration test executive report is clear, professional, and effectively communicates the results and recommendations to your clients.
