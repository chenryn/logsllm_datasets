Professional services
The most common strategies to bill customers for services are Turnkey and Time and
Material. Turnkey means all services have a set cost that can only adjust if services
are requested outside of agreed upon scope of work. Typically, modifications to a
Turnkey engagement require a separate request for change that the customer must
accept prior to including additional billing.
Turnkey services put the risk of losing profitability on the service provider, because
cost does not adjust regardless the amount of labor required to meet the scope of
work. This means the service provider has an opportunity to complete tasks under
proposed time equaling additional profit. This could also backfire when services
exceed the cost of labor. This is why it is absolutely critical to define an achievable
scope of work for proposed services with some additional padding hours used for
unforeseen incidents.

Chapter 8
Customers tend to lean towards Turnkey services based on the ability to plan
for expected costs. Customers can focus on achieving the results expected from
requested services and hold service providers responsible when tasks are not
completed without incurring additional labor costs. Large organizations like the US
federal government are known to request for Turnkey services in formal Requests
for Pricing (RFP) public postings. In most situations, there are guidelines written
by the procurement office to determine who will be awarded the engagement based
on factors such as best value, price, and meeting required items. We have seen RFPs
backfire when the procurement office selects services based solely on best price. In
some cases, the bad services cause more problems and cost multiple times higher
to remediate than the previous best value offering. To help customers avoid this
situation, we recommend working with customers on how to request specific terms
and conditions that only qualified candidates could meet, to force a balance of best
value and cost as an awarding metric.
The other common billing method for services is Time and Materials. Time and
Materials proposals charge for hours used. Typically, service providers will list
different hourly rates for billing categories, such as Project Manager could be 100
dollars an hour, but a Senior Engineer is 200 dollars an hour. It is common for
services to be broken into task orders with expected hours to help the customer
prepare for expected charges as the project proceeds.
Time and Materials puts the risk of high cost services on the customer, because
services that exceed task orders continue to be billed. The benefit for customers is
they may be able to spend less if they can own part of the work, as well as avoid the
common extra padding hours charged with a Turnkey proposal. The downside for
customers is the service provider is not incentivized to finish the project and could
delay completion.
As a professional service provider, it is recommended to aim for developing a
Turnkey services offering as you build a practice. Well-defined practices can set
proper expectations with clients to avoid under scoping expected services. In our
experience, customers do not have blank checkbooks for services, and desire a set
cost prior to requesting for budget.
Periodically, customers may request to replace billable members with their
staff to reduce the overall project cost. For example, a customer may ask to
use an internal Project Manager for planning. This introduces the risk of
not properly managing resources, which could lead to problems and cause
excessive hours that will eat away at expected profits. We recommend
avoiding these scenarios, because it is difficult to control a team member
that is not directly part of your organization.

Penetration Test Executive Report
Documentation
Developing a deliverable can be broken into a few stages, as shown in the following
diagram. The first stage is Project Review. This is where the service provider reviews
the statement of work, customer business objectives, areas of concern, and proposed
value to provide. All of this plus additional identified material is used to build a
report template.
The next step is filling in the report template during the Information Collection stage.
Information captured includes devices identified, processes used, vulnerabilities
found, verification of vulnerabilities, suggested remediation, and other data.
Once all data is captured and aligned with the template, the third phase is preparing
a First Draft. This draft will not be customer facing and contain as much data as
possible. Last is the Review phase, used to slim down the report to the strongest data
along with tuning to meet business demands in a professional manner. Best practice
is having both a technical and professional writer edit the draft to make sure it
addresses both executive and technical staff requirements.
Project Information Review and
First Draft
Review Collection finalization
A scope of work should always account for hours needed to create
documentation. Typically 60 percent of the report writing time will be
used for the draft, and document review and project sign off will use the
remaining hours. Make sure to calculate the document lifecycle into your
project timeline to avoid lost revenue.
Report format
Regardless of the project type, there are certain items that should be included
in service deliverable documents. All documents should explain their purpose,
advertise your brand, identify parties involved, list work that was performed, and
conclude with an expected result. This section will provide some pointers and
examples for meeting formatting goals in a professional manner.

Cover page
A cover page at a minimal will provide a report name, version, date, author, service
provider name, and intended party. Cover pages can also list additional items such
as the document security classification or highlight results from other sections.
Confidentiality statement
The information obtained during the majority of penetration services will be
sensitive. It is critical to identify the level of security expected to protect information
captured during the engagement, as well as name who is permitted to view such
data. Certain levels of clearance may require special handling or secured locations
for storage such as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) for
storing classified material. Violations of data privacy can have financial, brand, and
legal repercussions.
A Confidentiality statement should explain what level of security is involved with
the document, who is authorized to view it, what is and what is not permitted to
be copied, distribution rights, and other legal language. We recommend having
an individual with a legal background develop your standard Confidentiality
Statement.
Example 1: Confidentiality Statement
This document contains confidential and privileged information from SERVICE
PROVIDER. The information is intended for the private use of CUSTOMER for their
understanding of the current state of security of their organization. By accepting
this document, CUSTOMER agrees to keep the contents of this document in
confidence and not copy, disclose, or distribute it to any parties, other than those
that will provide services and/or products directly to CUSTOMER as a result of
the recommendations of this document, without written request to and written
confirmation from SERVICE PROVIDER. If you are not the intended recipient, be
aware that any disclosure, copying, or distribution of this document or its parts is
prohibited.
Example 2: Statement of Confidentiality
This confidential information is being provided to SERVICE PROVIDER as a
deliverable of this consulting engagement. The sole purpose of this document is to
provide CUSTOMER with the results and recommendations from this engagement.
Each recipient agrees that they will follow the distribution restrictions according to
the agreement between this consulting agent and SERVICE PROVIDER.

Timeline
Timelines provide an estimate of hours for each phase of a project. Timelines should
include the phase name, tasks to be completed, and expected duration for that phase.
Typically, the duration is displayed in billable hours so the client can estimate the
cost for each phase of the project. It is recommended to include language for which
phases are mandatory to avoid requests to remove critical phases such as the project
kickoff.
Following is an estimated timeline and high-level implementation plan:
Service Rrovider will begin this engagement starting two weeks after receiving the
signed statement of work (SOW), and customer purchase order subject to resource
availability. If the Customer requests an expedited engagement start date, this must
be negotiated with Service Provider, Project Management, and Account Team.
The project launch phase and remediation presentation phases are mandatory phases
for all other phases.

Executive summary
The goal of an Executive report is providing a high-level overview of why services
were performed. Executive summaries should cover what led up to the issue being
addressed, the problematic situation, and proposed solution with expected results.
Executive reports don't require technical details and should target leadership rather
than technical staff.
Example 1: Executive Summary
Background:
CUSTOMER engaged SERVICE PROVIDER to conduct a vulnerability assessment
and Penetration Test of its systems. The purpose of the engagement was to assess the
security of CUSTOMER networks and systems by identifying potential security flaws
in them by utilizing SERVICE PROVIDER's proven testing methodology. The project
was conducted on a number of systems on CUSTOMER's network segments by a
team of SERVICE PROVIDER experts during DATE OF ENGAGEMENT.
[ 285 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Penetration Test Executive Report
This project included Penetration Testing nine (9) internal hosts. For the testing,
SERVICE PROVIDER focused on the following:
• Attempt to determine what system-level vulnerabilities could be discovered
and exploited with no prior knowledge of the environment or notification to
administrators.
• Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities found and access confidential information
that may be stored on systems.
• Document and report on all findings.
All tests took into consideration the actual business processes implemented by the
systems and their potential threats; therefore, the results of this assessment reflect a
realistic picture of the actual exposure levels to online hackers.
This document contains the results of that assessment.
Project Information:
The primary goal of this assessment was to provide an analysis of security
flaws present in CUSTOMER's networks and systems. This assessment
was conducted to identify possible vulnerabilities and provide actionable
recommendations on remediating the vulnerabilities to provide a greater
level of security for the environment.
SERVICE PROVIDER used its proven Penetration Testing methodology to
assess the systems' security and identify potential security flaws.
Example 2: Executive Summary
SERVICE PROVIDER engaged CUSTOMER to conduct a Network Penetration
Test on a quantified number of systems in their network. These systems were
identified by the host numbers 192.168.1.X, 10.1.1.X, and 172.16.1.X. The purpose
of this engagement was to identify and prioritize the security vulnerabilities on the
identified systems. The engagement was launched on [START DATE] and included
four (4) days of testing, analysis, and documentation.
Methodology
It is highly recommended to provide an overview of how you deliver services.
Highlights should include your process for each phase of an engagement, tools
used, and how you handle identified threats. It is common to develop diagrams
showcasing process flow and resource reporting structures for this section.
[ 286 ]

Chapter 8
Certifications can help showcase a service provider's ability to provide quality
results. There are certifications that highlight a company's ability to follow proven
methodology for business flow such as the International Organization for
Standards (ISO) certifications (For example, ISO 9001 or 14001). Other certifications
could be focused on a specific technology, such as having engineers certified to
install the technology being requested. Popular Penetration Testing certifications are
the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN), which
help qualify the resources being contracted.
For Example: Methodology
SERVICE PROVIDER used custom and publicly available tools to gain perspective of
the network's security posture from a hacker's point of view. These methods provide
CUSTOMER with an understanding of the risks that threaten its information, and
also the strengths and weaknesses of its current controls protecting those systems.
The results were achieved and exacted by profiling CUSTOMER internal networks
using publicly available information, mapping the network architecture, identifying
hosts and services, enumerating network and system level vulnerabilities,
discovering unexpected hosts within the environment, and eliminating false
positives that might have arisen from scanning.

Detailed testing procedures
This section covers details from the service engagement. The target audience is
typically the technical staff, and the goal is to provide as much information as
possible around identified areas of concern. Customers may want to challenge a
highlighted item and repeat the steps used to validate the vulnerability, meaning
they want to know how things are discovered, accessed, and exploited. This data
also verifies all requested network areas labeled in the scope of work have been
addressed by the service provider.
Typically, subjects to include are targets discovery, mapping, vulnerability
assessment, architecture analysis, exploiting, and reporting. How far a service
provider goes in any area is based on what the statement of work defines as the focus
of the engagement.
For example,
SERVICE PROVIDER was able to access the Legacy EMR host using the default
system administrator credentials for MS SQL. This access allowed us to create an
administrator account, expose system processes, user accounts, database files, and
enable the transfer and execution of files. An attacker with this level of access would
be able to disrupt all business processes that rely on this host.
SERVICE PROVIDER was also able to use the Server Message Block (SMB) Null
User account to enumerate user account names and groups from the Domain Name
Server (DNS). An attacker could use this information for targeted phishing attacks
on CUSTOMER employees or to conduct brute force password guessing attacks.
An attacker who gains administrative credentials successfully to create other user
accounts and assign them to target business roles could use user group information.
Overall, the findings identify threats that can be mitigated through simple device/
software configuration settings along with supporting policies.
Vulnerability assessment and Penetration Testing summary:
CUSTOMER provided SERVICE PROVIDER with the eight (8) IP addresses are listed
in the following table. This range was scanned to determine open ports and services
running on the related hosts.

Summary of findings
The Summary of findings is the meat behind the proposal. This is where the findings
from the services are explained, including how items identified may impact business.
How these results are formatted will determine your customer's reaction, so be
aware of not only what is said, but also how data is presented.
Best practice is including a risk ranking to help customers understand how to react
to items identified. Common ranking characteristics are likelihood, risk evaluation,
charts, color schemes, and so on. We recommend including both a summary chart
and detailed section on all individually identified items. To back up your findings,
best practice is having references to public sources on why the identified asset has an
issue to further validate your claim. Public sources could be violations in compliance,
