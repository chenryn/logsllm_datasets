**Setting Up "Edit with IDLE" for .py Files on Linux Mint Julia**

On Windows, Python provides built-in support for right-clicking a `.py` file and selecting "Edit with IDLE," which opens the file in the IDLE editor rather than running it. I am using Linux Mint Julia, a Debian-based distribution, and I would like to achieve the same functionality.

Currently, when I select my default program from the context menu, I can only choose `idle3`, which opens both an interpreter (with a chevron prompt) and the file I want to edit. Is there a way to set up "Open with IDLE" so that it opens just the editor window, without the interpreter, until I explicitly choose to run the file?

**Solution:**

To configure IDLE to open only the editor window when you open a `.py` file, follow these steps:

1. Open IDLE.
2. Go to the **Options** menu and select **Configure IDLE...**.
3. In the **General** tab, locate the **At Startup** section.
4. Select **Open Edit Window** instead of **Open Shell Window**.
5. Click **Apply** or **OK** to save the settings.

IDLE will now save this setting, and from now on, it will open just the editor window when you open a `.py` file.

Thank you for your help!
