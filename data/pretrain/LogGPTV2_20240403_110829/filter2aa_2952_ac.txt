preferably offsite so that data cannot be accessed via the network.
• Have a well-thought-out incident response and communications plan. 
• Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data. In 
particular, look at which data anyone with access to an employee account 
or device would have access to (for example, through device or account 
takeover via phishing).
• Strongly consider instituting role-based access, limiting company-wide 
data access, and restricting access to sensitive data.
• Employ host-based controls; one of the best defenses and warning signals 
to thwart attacks is to conduct client-based host logging and intrusion 
detection capabilities. 
• Implement basic incident response and detection deployments and 
controls like network IDS, netflow collection, host logging, and web proxy, 
alongside human monitoring of detection sources. 
• Be aware of partner or supply chain security standards. Being able to 
monitor and enforce security standards for ecosystem partners is an 
important part of any organization’s security posture.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA
 Recorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat actors 
and their activity, focusing on state actors from China, Iran, Russia, 
and North Korea, as well as cyber criminals - individuals and groups 
- from Russia, CIS states, China, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize 
tracking activity  groups and where possible, attributing them to 
nation state government, organizations, or affiliate institutions.
Our coverage includes:
• 
Government organizations and intelligence agencies, 
their associated laboratories, partners, industry 
collaborators, proxy entities, and individual threat 
actors.
• 
Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation state 
activity groups, such as RedAlpha, RedBravo, Red Delta, 
and BlueAlpha and many other industry established 
groups.
• 
Cybercriminal individuals and groups established and 
named by Recorded Future
• 
Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,persistent 
commodity malware
Insikt Group names a new threat activity group or campaign 
when analysts have data corresponding to at least three points 
on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium 
confidence, derived from our Security Intelligence Graph. We can tie 
this to a threat actor only when we can point to a handle, persona, 
person, or organization responsible. We will write about the activity 
as a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data. We 
use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a particular 
group when the public body of empirical evidence is clear the activity 
corresponds to a known group.
Insikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet 
naming convention for new nation state threat actor groups or 
campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag colors, 
currently represented below, with more color/nation pairings to 
be added as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups 
associated with new nations.
For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt Group uses a 
naming convention corresponding to the Greek alphabet. Where we 
have identified a criminal entity connected to a particular country, 
we will use the appropriate country color, and where that group may 
be tied to a specific government organization, tie it to that entity 
specifically.
Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming newly 
identified malware.
