### Data Security and Incident Response Best Practices

- **Offsite Data Storage:** Preferably, store data offsite to ensure it cannot be accessed via the network.
- **Incident Response and Communications Plan:** Develop a well-thought-out incident response and communications plan.
- **Data Compartmentalization:** Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data. Specifically, evaluate which data can be accessed by anyone with access to an employee account or device (e.g., through phishing attacks).
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Strongly consider implementing role-based access control, limiting company-wide data access, and restricting access to sensitive data.
- **Host-Based Controls:** Employ host-based controls, such as client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities, which are among the best defenses and warning signals against attacks.
- **Basic Incident Response and Detection:** Implement basic incident response and detection measures, including network IDS, netflow collection, host logging, and web proxy, along with human monitoring of detection sources.
- **Partner and Supply Chain Security:** Be aware of partner or supply chain security standards. Monitoring and enforcing security standards for ecosystem partners is a critical part of any organization’s security posture.

### Cyber Threat Analysis: China

**Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com**
**CTA-CN-2020-0728**

#### Recorded Future's Research Group: Insikt
Insikt tracks threat actors and their activities, focusing on state actors from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cybercriminals from Russia, CIS states, China, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity groups and, where possible, attributing them to nation-state governments, organizations, or affiliate institutions.

**Coverage Includes:**
- Government organizations and intelligence agencies, their associated laboratories, partners, industry collaborators, proxy entities, and individual threat actors.
- Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation-state activity groups, such as RedAlpha, RedBravo, RedDelta, and BlueAlpha, as well as many other industry-established groups.
- Cybercriminal individuals and groups established and named by Recorded Future.
- Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific, persistent commodity malware.

**Naming Conventions:**
- **Threat Activity Groups/Campaigns:** Insikt Group names a new threat activity group or campaign when analysts have data corresponding to at least three points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium confidence, derived from our Security Intelligence Graph. The naming convention uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet, with colors corresponding to the nation’s flag colors.
- **Cybercriminal Groups:** For newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt Group uses a naming convention corresponding to the Greek alphabet. If a criminal entity is connected to a particular country, the appropriate country color is used.
- **Malware:** Insikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming newly identified malware.

**Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis:**
- **Adversary**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Capability**
- **Victim**
