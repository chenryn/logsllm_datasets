User: I occasionally have Python programs that take a long time to run, and that I want to be able to save the state of and resume later. Does anyone have a clever way of saving the state either every x seconds, or when the program is exiting?
Assistant: If you ok with OOP, consider creating a method for each class that output a serialised version ( using pickle ) to file. Then add a second method to load in the instance the data, and if the pickled file is there you call the load method instead of the processing one. 
I use this approach for ML and it really seed up my workflow.
