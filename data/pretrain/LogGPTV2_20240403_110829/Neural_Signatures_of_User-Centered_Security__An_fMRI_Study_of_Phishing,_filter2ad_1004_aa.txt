Abstract— The security of computer systems often relies upon 
decisions  and  actions  of  end  users.  In  this  paper,  we  set  out  to 
investigate  user-centered  security  by  concentrating  at  the  most 
fundamental  component  governing  user  behavior  –  the  human 
brain.  We

methodology  to  inform  the  design  of  user-centered  security 
systems.  Specifically,  we  report  on  an  fMRI  study  measuring 
users’  security  performance  and  the  underlying  neural  activity 
with  respect  to  two  critical  security  tasks:  (1)  distinguishing 
between  a  legitimate  and  a  phishing  website,  and  (2)  heeding 
security  (malware)  warnings.  At  a  higher  level,  we  identify 
neural  markers that  might be  controlling users’  performance in 
these  tasks,  and  establish  relationships  between  brain  activity 
and  behavioral  performance  as  well  as  between  users’ 
personality traits and security behavior. 
Our  results  provide  a  largely  positive  perspective  towards 
users’ capability and performance vis-à-vis these crucial security 
tasks.  First, we show that users exhibit significant brain activity 
in  key  regions  associated  with  decision-making,  attention,  and 
problem-solving  (phishing  and  malware  warnings)  as  well  as 
language comprehension and reading (malware warnings), which 
means  that  users  are  actively  engaged  in  these  security  tasks. 
Second,  we  demonstrate  that  certain  individual  traits,  such  as 
impulsivity  measured via an established questionnaire, can have 
a  significant  negative  effect  on  brain  activation  in  these  tasks. 
Third, we  discover  a  high  degree  of  correlation  in  brain  activity 
(in  decision-making  regions)  across  phishing  detection  and 
malware  warnings  tasks,  which  implies  that  users’  behavior  in 
one  task  may  potentially  be  predicted  by  their  behavior  in  the 
other  task.  Finally,  we  discuss  the  broader 
impacts  and 
implications  of  our  work  on  the  field  of  user-centered  security, 
including  the  domain  of  security  education,  targeted  security 
training, and security screening.

securing computer systems has become paramount. To enable 
secure  on-line  interactions,  actions  performed  and  decisions 
made by human users need to be factored into system design – 
a  principle  sometimes  referred  to as  “human  in  the  loop” [9]. 
Two  such  prominent  user-centered  security  tasks  are:  (1) 
distinguishing  between  a  legitimate  and  a  fake  web-site 
(phishing  detection  task),  and  (2)  heeding  warnings  provided 
by modern browsers when connecting to potentially malicious 
web-sites (malware warnings task). User attitudes, perceptions, 
acceptance and use of information technology have been long-
standing  issues  since  the  early  days  of  computing.  This  is 
especially  true  in  secure  computing  since  user  behavior  can 
directly or indirectly impact the security of the system. In this 
light, it is important to understand users’ behavior in executing 
security tasks and their potential susceptibility to attacks. 
The 
security  has 
field  of  user-centered 
received 
considerable  attention  recently  but  is  still  in  its  infancy.  As 
such, our understanding of end user performance in real-world 
security  tasks  is  not  very  precise  or  clear  at  this  point.  A 
number  of  computer  lab-based  studies  focusing  on  security 
warnings and security indicators (e.g., [10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 
17]) came to the conclusion that users hardly perform well at 
these tasks and often ignore them. This general wisdom in this 
area has been called into question by a recent large-scale field 
study  of  modern  browsers’  phishing,  SSL  and  malware 
warnings  [11],  which  showed  that  users  actually  heed  these 
warnings with high likelihood.  
In this paper, we set out to enhance the current knowledge 
in,  and  address  fundamental  questions  pertaining  to,  user-
centered  security  from  a  neuropsychological  standpoint.  The 
primary questions driving our research include: (1) whether or 
not users actively engage in security tasks; (2) do users ignore 
or  bypass  these  tasks;  (3)  what  brain  regions  get  activated 
while  performing  these  tasks;  (4)  how  well  users  perform  at 
these  tasks;  (5)  whether  certain  personality  traits  influence 
users’  security  behavior  and  performance;  and  (6)  is  users’ 
behavior in one task related to their behavior in another task.  
In  an  attempt  to  answer  these  inquiries,  we  introduce  a 
novel  methodology  for  studying  user-centered  security  –  one 
that  involves  neuroimaging.  By  means  of  this  general 
methodology,  our  overarching  goal  is  to  delineate  the  nature 
of  cognitive  and  neural  processes  that  underlie  user-centered 
security decisions and actions. This specific goal in our work 
reported  in  this  paper  is  achieved  via  fMRI  (functional 
Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging)  scanning.  fMRI  provides  a 
unique  opportunity  to  examine  the  brain  responses,  in-vivo, 
mediating  user  decisions  during  human-computer  security 
interactions.  As  a  first  line  of  investigation  into  our  novel 
methodology,  this  fMRI  study  will  shed  light  on  end  users’ 
behavior and performance with respect to the important tasks 
of phishing detection  and malware warnings. 
Contributions  &  Results  Summary: Our main contributions 
in this paper are summarized as follows: 
1.  Novel  Methodology  to  Study  User-Centered  Security: We 
propose  a  new  generalized  methodology  for  studying 
neurological  patterns  governing  users’  performance  and 
behavior with respect to user-centered security tasks. 
2.  fMRI  Study  of  Phishing,  and  Malware  Warnings:  As  a 
specific use case of our methodology, we design and develop 
in-scanner  fMRI  experiments  for  phishing  detection  and 
malware  warnings  tasks  (Section  III),  and  conduct  a  user 
study  by  recruiting  and  scanning  25  individuals  performing 
these tasks. (Section IV) 
3.  Comprehensive  Neural  and  Behavioral  Analysis:  We 
provide  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  neuroimaging  and 
behavioral  data,  not  only  evaluating  the  phishing  and 
malware  warnings  experiments 
independently  but  also 
contrasting them with each other. (Section V-VII) 
The  results  of  our  study  provide  a  largely  positive 
perspective  towards  users’  capability  and  performance  with 
respect  to  phishing  detection  and  malware  warnings  tasks. 
First,  we  show  that  users  exhibit  significant  brain  activity  in 
key  regions  associated  with  decision-making,  attention,  and 
problem-solving  (phishing  and  malware  warnings)  as  well  as 
language  comprehension  and  reading  (malware  warnings), 
which means that users are actively engaged in these tasks. In 
case  of  malware  warnings,  this  level  of  brain  activation 
matched  with  users’  good  task  performance  reflected  by  the 
behavioral  data  (confirming  the  findings  reported  in  [11]).  In 
case of the phishing task, however, the behavioral performance 
was  poor  despite  significant  activation  in  brain  regions 
correlated with higher order cognitive processing.  Second, we 
demonstrate 
traits,  specifically 
impulsivity measured via a simple questionnaire [1], can have 
a significant negative effect on brain activation in these tasks. 
In  other  words,  impulsive  individuals  showed  lower  brain 
activation and may thus have poor task performance. Third, we 
discover  a  high  degree  of  correlation  in  brain  activity  (with 
respect  to  decision-making  regions)  across  phishing  detection 
and  malware  warnings  tasks,  which  implies  that  users’ 
behavior  in  one  task  may  potentially  be  predicted  by  their 
behavior  in  the  other  task.    Finally,  we  discuss  the  broader 
impact  and  implications  of  our  work  to  the  field  of  user-
centered  security,  including  the  domain  of  security  education, 
targeted security training, and security screening.

A. 
fMRI Overview 
fMRI  (Functional  MRI) 
is  derived 
function  measure,  and 
is  a  Blood  Oxygen  Level 
Dependent 
from  a 
combination of stimulus-induced changes in the local cerebral 
blood flow, local blood volume, and local oxygen consumption 
rate  [5].  It  is  assumed  that  such  changes  are  associated  with 
changes  in  neuronal  activity  [6]  and  thus  fMRI  provides  an 
indirect  measure  of  the  underlying  neuronal  activity.  In 
contrast  to  other  brain  scanning  approaches,  such  as  EEG, 
fMRI  has  a  much  better  spatial  resolution.  In  an  fMRI  scan, 
human  participants lie  down  in  the  MRI  scanner and perform 
cognitive tasks while their brain activity is being measured. In 
this way, we can time-lock the participant’s brain activity to a 
certain  cognitive  event.  fMRI  is  an  appealing  platform  to 
conduct  small-scale  studies  providing  high  spatial  resolution. 
In  sum,  fMRI  measures  brain  activity  by  detecting  related 
changes in blood flow. 
B.  Our Experimental Set-Up 
Throughout the project, the fMRI data was acquired using 
the  3T  Siemens  Allegra  Scanner  available  to  us  at  Civitan 
International Research Center at the University of Alabama in 
Birmingham,  our  University  (see  Figure  1)  depicting  our 
scanner and the experimental set-up). All fMRI tasks followed 
the  same  data  acquisition  protocol  as  follows.  For  functional 
imaging,  we  used  a  single-shot  gradient-recalled  echo-planar 
pulse  sequence  that  offers  the  advantage  of  rapid  image 
acquisition (Repetition Time = 1000 ms, Echo Time = 30 ms, 
flip angle = 60 degrees, Field of View = 24 cm, matrix = 64 x 
64). This sequence covers most of the cortex (seventeen 5-mm 
thick slices with a 1 mm gap) in a single cycle of scanning (1 
TR) with an in-plane resolution of 3.75 x 3.75 x 5 mm3. 
C.  Ethical and Safety Considerations 
Fig. 1 A pilot subject being prepared for the scan  
Our study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)  at  our  University.  Care  was  taken  to  maximize  the 
safety  of  the  participants  while  being  scanned  by  following 
standard practices. Their participation in the study was strictly 
voluntary.  The  participants  signed  an  informed  consent  form 
prior to the study and were given the option to withdraw from 
the study at any point of time. Best practices were followed to 
protect  the  confidentiality  and  privacy  of  participants’  data 
acquired during the study by de-identifying the collected data. 
D.  Study Limitations, and Sample Size 
In line with any other study involving human subjects, our 
study  also  had  certain  limitations.  A  primary  limitation 
pertains to the constraints posed by the fMRI experimental set 
up. Since the participants were performing the tasks inside the 
fMRI  scanner,  the  set  up  did  not  mimic  real-world  online 
browsing  experience.  The  discomfort  associated  with  lying 
down in a supine position and being stationary may have also 
impacted participants’ brain activity. In addition, just the fact 
that  the  participants  were  being  scanned,  may  have  impacted 
their  brain  activation  and  behavioral 
responses.  The 
constrained  interface  (image-based  display,  binary  input  and 
no internet connectivity, unlike a modern computer) available 
during  the  scans  may  have  limited  participants’  interactions 
with the system. For example, the participants were presented 
with  the  images  of  the  websites  (rather  than  the  websites 
themselves)  in  the  phishing  task.  Similarly,  the  malware 
warning images that could be shown on the displays were very 
simplistic  and  rudimentary.  We  believe  that  this  may    have 
negatively 
the 
underlying  security  tasks.  Furthermore,  participants’  head 
motion in the MRI scanner, although we have corrected for it 
(Section  V.A),  may  have  impacted  the  fMRI  data  quality. 
Finally,  the  lab-based  environment  of  the  study  may  have 
impacted participants’ behavior as they may not have felt real 
security risks during the experiments.  
affected  participants’  performance 
in 
The effective sample size used in our study ranged from 22 
(phishing  detection  task)  to  25  (malware  warnings  task) 
participants (see Section V.A), which previous power analysis 
studies  have  found  to  be  optimal.  For  instance,  statistical
