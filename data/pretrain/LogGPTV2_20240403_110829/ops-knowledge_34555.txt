User: I'm trying to invoke a shell script shell_script.sh from a python script (python_script.py) using the call command. The shell_script.sh invokes a executable that requires root access to execute.  
The python_script.py invokes shell_script.sh using subprocess.call(). 
See below: 
subprocess.call(['/complete_path/shell_script.sh', 'param1', 'param2',
'param3'], shell=True)
When I try to execute the python script python_script.py it gives me permission denied. 
I've tried different ways. 
a) Invoke python with sudo - sudo python python_script.py 
b) Invoke sudo into inside the call method - subprocess.call(['sudo' '/complete_path/shell_script.sh', 'param1', 'param2',
'param3'], shell=True)
What's the best way to resolve this. 
Thanks.
Assistant: I'd put logic in the python_script.py to check its UID and fail if is not executed as root.  if os.getuid() != 0:.  That will ensure it only runs as root, ether by a root login, or sudo.
If you're getting permission denied when trying to execute the python_script.py, you need to set the execute bit on it. chmod +x python_script.py
