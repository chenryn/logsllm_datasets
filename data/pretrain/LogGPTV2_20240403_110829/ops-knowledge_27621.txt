User: How to optimize cloud computing costs and reduce the cost of cloud computing resources?
Assistant: 1. Manage resource usage: Keep an eye on resource usage and shut down unused instances to reduce resource usage; 2. Implement elastic scaling: Employ elastic scaling to allow organizations to use fewer resources at low levels of utilization, And dynamically expand the use of the corresponding rubber band under high load, instead of maintaining large-scale resource usage; 3. Cut storage costs: use data lifecycle management to move stored data to low-cost storage according to time or other rules Option; 4. Execute a cost-cutting plan: find and remove unnecessary useless resources, unsubscribe idle instances and reduce resource types, and cut cloud computing costs while maintaining appropriate service level guarantees; 5. Adopt variable flexible usage : implement variable computing, and providers such as AWS or Azure provide on-demand pricing only when actually used; 6. Adopt a hybrid cloud strategy: risks can be offset without causing inconvenience to the organization's important operating structure, thereby reducing costs .
