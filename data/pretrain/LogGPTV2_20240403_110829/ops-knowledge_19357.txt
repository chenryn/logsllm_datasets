User: I have a command line app the continuously outputs YAML data in the form:

- col0: datum0
  col1: datum1
  col2: datum2
- col0: datum0
  col1: datum1
  col2: datum2
...

It does this for all of eternity. I would like to write a Python script that continuously reads each of these records.
The PyYAML library seems best at taking fully loaded strings and interpreting those as a complete YAML document. Is there a way to put PyYAML into a "streaming" mode?
Or is my only option to chunk the data myself and feed it bit by bit into PyYAML?
Assistant: All of the references to stream in the the documentation seem to be referring to a stream of documents... I've never tried to use it in the way you describe, but it seems like chunking the data into such a stream of documents is a reasonable approach.
