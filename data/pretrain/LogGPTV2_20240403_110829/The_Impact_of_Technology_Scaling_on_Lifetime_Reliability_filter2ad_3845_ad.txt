### 4. Power Consumption and Density Analysis

Table 4 presents the total power consumption (dynamic + leakage power) based on simulations, as well as the relative total power density (the ratio of total power consumption to area), averaged across all applications. Up to 90 nm, scaling reduces the total power consumption of the core. However, the average power density increases steadily with scaling due to non-ideal voltage reduction and increased leakage power.

### 5. Results

#### 5.1 Temperature Analysis

**Figure 2: Maximum Temperatures Reached by Any Structure**

- **(a) SpecFP Temperatures**
- **(b) SpecInt Temperatures**

The figure shows the maximum temperature reached by any structure on the chip for each application and technology generation. The heat sink temperature, averaged across all applications, is also shown. We adjusted the heat sink thermal resistance to keep this temperature constant with scaling.

As seen in Figure 2, while the heat sink temperature remains nearly constant with scaling, the temperature of the hottest structure on the chip increases. On average, from 180 nm to 65 nm (1.0V), the temperature of the hottest structure increased by 15 degrees Kelvin. This increase is due to the rising power density on the chip, as indicated in Table 4.

The results also show a significant range in temperatures across applications. There is a high correlation between application power and temperature, and some correlation with Instructions Per Cycle (IPC). The hottest applications (wupwise and apsi for SpecFP and crafty for SpecInt) in Figure 2 also have the highest power consumptions and high IPCs in Table 3. Conversely, the coolest applications (ammp for SpecFP and vpr for SpecInt) exhibit the lowest power consumptions and IPCs.

- **(b) SpecInt Applications**

Figures 3 and 4 present the data for this section. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the scaling behavior of the total processor FIT value for each application, for SpecFP and SpecInt respectively. They also show FIT values calculated based on worst-case conditions (labeled as "max") over all applications. To compute these worst-case values, we used the highest activity factor (α) and the highest temperature across all applications for the entire run. Note that this represents the worst-case conditions only for the applications studied; the maximum FIT value of the processor could be even higher.

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the FIT value averaged across all applications, with scaling for SpecFP and SpecInt, respectively. At each technology generation, each FIT bar is broken down into individual contributions by each failure mechanism, which will be discussed in Section 5.3.

**Increase in Total FIT Value:**

There is a marked rise in the total FIT value with technology scaling. On average, the total FIT value of the SpecFP applications increases by 274% from 180 nm to 65 nm (1.0V). The increase for SpecInt was larger at 357%. At each scaled technology point, the average FIT value of SpecInt applications was higher than SpecFP applications due to the higher power consumptions in integer applications.

There is a significant difference in FIT value from 65 nm (0.9V) to 65 nm (1.0V). As discussed in Section 1, many architectural structures may not operate reliably at voltages lower than 1.0V. However, maintaining a constant voltage from 90 nm to 65 nm leads to a large rise in FIT values. If the voltage scales down from 90 nm to 65 nm, the increase in FIT value from 180 nm to 65 nm (0.9V) is reduced to 70% for SpecFP and 86% for SpecInt.

**Workload Dependence of FIT Value:**

In Figure 3, two points are noteworthy when considering the workload dependence on the total FIT value. First, the worst-case FIT value is distinctly higher than the FIT value of any individual application, and this difference increases with scaling. Specifically, compared to the application with the highest FIT value, the worst-case FIT value is 25% higher for 180 nm and 90% higher at 65 nm (computed as a percentage of the highest FIT seen by any application). More striking is the difference between the worst-case FIT value and the average application FIT value—67% at 180 nm and 206% at 65 nm.

Second, there is a large range in FIT values across applications, and this range increases with scaling. FIT values for applications correlate well with application temperature. The hottest applications (from Figure 2) also have the highest FIT values, and the order of the curves in Figures 2 and 3 remains the same. This is because, at any given technology point, the only difference in the FIT values of applications arises from temperature differences and the value of α (through the activity factor, β). However, the slope of the FIT value curves is steeper than the slope of the temperature curve due to the more than linear dependence of FIT values on temperature (as seen in the temperature column in Table 1). Thus, the range in FIT values across applications also increases with scaling. The range across all applications (SpecFP + SpecInt) increases from 2479 FIT (which is 62% of the average FIT value) at 180 nm to 5095 (which is 72% of the average FIT value) at 65 nm (0.9V) to 17272 (which is 104% of the average FIT value) at 65 nm (1.0V).

Our results indicate that future reliability qualification mechanisms should be application-aware; otherwise, the processor could be severely over-designed for most applications. Our previous work proposed dynamic reliability management as an application-aware reliability approach [15]; the quantification here unequivocally shows the increasing importance of such approaches.

#### 5.3 Individual Failure Mechanisms

**Figure 5: Failure Rates for Each Failure Mechanism for SpecFP and SpecInt**

- **(a) EM SpecFP**
- **(b) SM SpecFP**
- **(c) TDDB SpecFP**
- **(d) TC SpecFP**
- **(e) EM SpecInt**
- **(f) SM SpecInt**
- **(g) TDDB SpecInt**
- **(h) TC SpecInt**

Next, we examine the scaling behavior of individual failure mechanisms, illustrated in Figure 5. The figure also provides data on the worst-case operating conditions (as seen during an application run, and measured as in Section 5.2).

**EM Scaling:**

Scaling has a significant impact on electromigration failure rate. From 180 nm to 65 nm (1.0V), the failure rate increases by 303% on average for SpecFP and 447% on average for SpecInt. From 180 nm to 65 nm (0.9V), the increase is 97% for SpecFP and 128% for SpecInt. As seen in Table 1, the increase is due to temperature and a reduction in interconnect dimensions (λ and ρ). The temperature dependence is underscored by the difference in FIT values between 65 nm (0.9V) and 65 nm (1.0V) (where the only distinction is from temperature). As discussed in Section 5.2 for total FIT values, there is a large range in FIT values across applications for electromigration and a large difference between worst-case and application FIT values.

**SM Scaling:**

For stress migration (SM), there is a 76% increase in FIT values from 180 nm to 65 nm (1.0V) and a 43% increase from 180 nm to 65 nm (0.9V) for SpecFP on average. The corresponding values for SpecInt are 106% and 52%. Scaling impacts stress migration through an increase in temperature. The exponential dependence of stress migration failure rate on temperature (as shown in Table 1) can be seen in Figure 5. Like electromigration, the large jump in FIT value between 65 nm (0.9V) and 65 nm (1.0V) is entirely due to the exponential impact of temperature. However, this increase is smaller than the increase seen in electromigration due to the \( \lambda^{\beta} \) term in the stress migration equation (Equation 2). This term improves reliability with scaling, but its impact is overshadowed by the exponential relationship. There is a large range in FIT values across applications for stress migration and a large difference between worst-case and application FIT values, though the magnitude of these differences is less than that seen in electromigration.

**TDDB Scaling:**

As seen in Table 1, TDDB FIT value depends heavily on the values of \( E_a \) and \( n \) used. There is also a more than exponential dependence on temperature. The negative effect of \( n \) combined with temperature results in an overall decrease in TDDB reliability with scaling, despite the positive effect of voltage scaling. This is compounded by the non-ideal scaling of voltage. As a result, these factors contribute to the huge increase in FIT value from 180 nm to 65 nm (1.0V)—667% on average for SpecFP and 812% for SpecInt. The increase from 180 nm to 65 nm (0.9V) is less severe but still significant (106% for SpecFP and 127% for SpecInt).

Unlike other failure mechanisms, the change in TDDB FIT values does not completely follow the change in temperature. This is due to the voltage dependence of TDDB. Although the temperature increases from 180 nm to 130 nm, the drop in voltage between these two technology points reduces the FIT value. The beneficial impact of voltage is highlighted by the large difference between the FIT values at 65 nm (0.9V) and 65 nm (1.0V) (the difference is magnified further due to the temperature difference between the two points).

**TC Scaling:**

There is a 52% increase in thermal cycling (TC) FIT values from 180 nm to 65 nm (1.0V) and a 32% increase from 180 nm to 65 nm (0.9V) for SpecFP on average. The corresponding values for SpecInt are 66% and 36%. Like stress migration, scaling impacts the FIT value of thermal cycling through an increase in temperature. However, unlike stress migration, which has an exponential dependence on temperature, thermal cycling varies as the power of \( m \), the Coffin-Manson exponent (as seen in Table 1). In our experiments, we used a value of 2.35 for \( m \). Hence, although there is an increase in FIT value due to temperature with scaling, the increase is less steep than stress migration. The range in FIT values across applications is also smaller than that seen in stress migration. The difference between the worst-case FIT values and application FIT values is also small.

### 6. Conclusions

Advances in CMOS semiconductor technology, driven by aggressive device scaling, have been steadily improving processor performance. However, CMOS scaling is resulting in escalated power densities and processor temperatures, accelerating the onset of problems due to long-term hardware failures or lifetime reliability.

In this paper, we take the first step in establishing a basic understanding (at the architect's level) of the reliability implications of scaling in the deep-submicron era. Our results point to potentially large and sharp drops in long-term reliability, especially beyond 90 nm. Of the failure modes modeled, time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and electromigration present the steepest challenge. Our results also illustrate how scaling is increasing the difference between failure rates assuming worst-case conditions versus typical operating conditions, as well as amplifying the differences among different applications.

Our results present two broad implications. First, it will become increasingly difficult to leverage a single microarchitectural design for multiple remaps across a few technology generations. Second, the need for workload-specific, microarchitectural lifetime reliability awareness is illustrated.
