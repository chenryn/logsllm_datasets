niques [4]. Table 4 also gives the total power consumption
(dynamic + leakage power), based on simulations, and the
relative total power density (which is the ratio of the total
power consumption and area), averaged across all applica-
tions. Up to 90nm, scaling reduces the total power con-
sumption of the core. However, the average power density
goes up steadily with scaling (due to non-ideal voltage re-
duction and increases in leakage power).

We start by presenting results for temperature since they
affect reliability so signiﬁcantly. Figure 2 shows the maxi-
mum temperature reached by any structure on chip for each
application for each technology generation. Also shown is
the heat sink temperature, averaged over all applications (re-
call that we adjust the heat sink thermal resistance such that
this temperature remains constant with scaling). As can be
seen, while the heat sink temperature remains nearly con-
stant with scaling, the temperature of the hottest structure
increases. On average, from 180nm to 65nm (1.0V), the
temperature of the hottest structure on chip increased by 15

degrees Kelvin. Application temperatures increase because
the power density on chip (as seen in Table 4) is increasing
with scaling.
The results also show that there is a signiﬁcant range in
temperatures across applications. There is high correlation
between application power and temperature and some cor-
relation with IPC. The hottest applications (wupwise and
apsi for SpecFP and crafty for SpecInt) in Figure 2 also
have the highest power consumptions (and high IPCs) in
Table 3. The same holds for the coolest applications in our
suite (ammp for SpecFP and vpr for SpecInt).

Figures 3 and 4 present the data for this section. Fig-
ures 3 (a) and (b) show the scaling behavior of the total
processor FIT value for each application, for SpecFP and
SpecInt respectively. They also show FIT values calculated
based on worst-case conditions (labeled as max) over all
the applications. To compute these worst-case values, we
found the highest activity factor () and the highest tem-
perature across all applications and used them for the en-
tire run. Note that this is worst-case conditions only for the
applications studied – it is possible that the maximum FIT
value of the processor can be even higher. Figures 4 (a)
and (b) show the FIT value averaged across all the applica-
tions, with scaling (for SpecFP and SpecInt respectively).
At each technology generation, each FIT bar has also been
broken down into the individual contributions by each fail-
ure mechanism, which will be discussed in Section 5.3.
Increase in Total FIT value: As can be seen, there is a
marked rise in the total FIT value with technology scaling.
On average, the total FIT value of the SpecFP applications
increases by 274% from 180nm to 65nm (1.0V). The in-
crease seen in SpecInt was larger at 357%. Also, at each
scaled technology point, the average FIT value of SpecInt
applications was higher than SpecFP applications. This is
because of the higher power consumptions seen in the in-
teger applications. There is a signiﬁcant difference in FIT
value from 65nm (0.9V) to 65nm (1.0V). As discussed in
Section 1, many architectural structures can potentially not
operate reliably at voltages lower than 1.0V. However, as
can be seen, maintaining a constant voltage from 90nm to
65nm leads to a large rise in FIT values. On the other hand,
if the voltage does scale down from 90nm to 65nm, the in-
crease in FIT value seen from 180nm to 65nm (0.9V) is
brought down to (a still signiﬁcant) 70% for SpecFP and
86% for SpecInt.
Workload dependence of FIT value: In Figure 3, when
considering the workload dependence on the total FIT
value, there are two points of note. First, the worst-case
FIT value is distinctly higher than the FIT value of any in-
dividual application. More signiﬁcantly, this difference in-
creases with scaling. Speciﬁcally, compared to the appli-
cation with the highest FIT value, the worst-case FIT value
is 25% higher for 180nm and 90% higher at 65nm (com-
puted as a percentage of the highest FIT seen by any ap-
plication). More striking was the difference between the
worst-case FIT value and the average application FIT value
– 67% at 180nm and 206% at 65nm.
Second, Figure 3 also show that there is a large range
in FIT values across applications, and this range increases
with scaling. FIT values for applications correlate well with
application temperature. The hottest applications (from Fig-
ure 2) also have the highest FIT values, and the order of the
curves in Figures 2 and 3 remains the same. This is because,
at any given technology point, the only difference in the FIT
values of applications arises from temperature differences
and from differences in the value of  (through the activ-
ity factor, ). However, the slope of the FIT value curves
is steeper than the slope of the temperature curve. This is
because of the more than linear dependence of FIT values
on temperature (as can be seen in the temperature column in
Table 1). Thus, the range in FIT values across applications
also increases with scaling. The range across all applica-
tions (SpecFP + SpecInt) increases from 2479 FIT (which
is 62% of the average FIT value) at 180nm to 5095 (which
is 72% of the average FIT value) at 65nm (0.9V) to 17272

(which is 104% of the average FIT value) at 65nm (1.0V).
Our results indicate that future reliability qualiﬁcation
mechanisms should be application-aware; otherwise, the
processor could be severely over-designed for most applica-
tions. Our previous work proposed dynamic reliability man-
agement as an application-aware reliability approach [15];
the quantiﬁcation here unequivocally shows the increasing
importance of such approaches.
5.3
Individual failure mechanisms
Next we examine scaling behavior of individual failure
mechanisms, illustrated in Figure 5. The ﬁgure also pro-
vides data on the worst-case operating conditions (as seen
during an application run, and measured as in Section 5.2).
EM scaling: Scaling has a signiﬁcant impact on electro-
migration failure rate – going from 180nm to 65nm (1.0V),
the failure rate increases by 303% on average for SpecFP
and 447% on average for SpecInt. Going from 180nm to
65nm (0.9V), the increase is 97% for SpecFP and 128%
for SpecInt. As can be seen from Table 1, the increase is
due to temperature as well as a reduction in interconnect di-
mensions ((cid:0) and (cid:1)). The temperature dependence is under-
scored by the difference in FIT values between 65nm (0.9V)
and 65nm (1.0V) (where the only distinction is from tem-
perature). As discussed in Section 5.2 for total FIT values,
there is a large range in FIT values across applications for
electromigration and also a large difference between worst-
case and application FIT values.
SM scaling: For SM, there is a 76% increase in FIT val-
ues going from 180nm to 65nm (1.0V) and a 43% increase
going from 180nm to 65nm (0.9V) for SpecFP on average.
The corresponding values for SpecInt are 106% and 52%.
Scaling impacts stress migration through an increase in tem-
perature. The exponential dependence of stress migration
failure rate on temperature (as shown in Table 1) can be
seen in Figure 5. Like electromigration, the large jump in
FIT value between 65nm(0.9V) and 65nm (1.0V) is entirely
due to the exponential impact of temperature. However, this
increase is smaller than the increase seen in electromigra-
tion due to the (cid:0)(cid:2)   (cid:2)(cid:0)(cid:0)  term in the stress migration
equation (Equation 2). This term improves reliability with
scaling, but its impact is overshadowed by the exponential
relationship. There is a large range in FIT values across
applications for stress migration and also a large difference
between worst-case and application FIT values. However,
the magnitude of these differences is less than that seen in
electromigration.
TDDB scaling: As can be seen in Table 1, TDDB FIT value
depends heavily on the values of (cid:3) and (cid:2) used. There is
also a more than exponential dependence on temperature.
The negative effect of (cid:2) combined with temperature re-
sults in an overall decrease in TDDB reliability with scaling,
despite the positive effect of voltage scaling. This is com-

pounded by the non-ideal scaling of voltage. As a result,
these factors contribute to the huge increase in FIT value
from 180nm to 65nm (1.0V) – 667% on average for SpecFP
and 812% for SpecInt. The increase from 180nm to 65nm
(0.9V) is less severe, but still signiﬁcant (106% for SpecFP
and 127% for SpecInt).
Unlike the other failure mechanisms,
the change in
TDDB FIT values does not completely follow the change
in temperature. This is because of the voltage dependence
of TDDB. Hence, although the temperature increases from
180nm to 130nm, the drop in voltage between these two
technology points reduces the FIT value. The beneﬁcial
impact of voltage is highlighted by the large difference be-
tween the FIT values at 65nm (0.9V) and 65nm (1.0V) (the
difference is magniﬁed further due to the temperature dif-
ference between the two points).
TC scaling: There is a 52% increase in TC FIT values go-
ing from 180nm to 65nm (1.0V) and a 32% increase going
from 180nm to 65nm (0.9V) for SpecFP on average. The
corresponding values for SpecInt are 66% and 36%. Like
stress migration, scaling impacts the FIT value of thermal
cycling through an increase in temperature. However, un-
like stress migration which has an exponential dependence
on temperature, thermal cycling varies as the power of ,
which is the Cofﬁn-Manson exponent (as seen in Table 1).
In our experiments, we used a value of 2.35 for . Hence, al-
though there is an increase in FIT value due to temperature
with scaling, the increase is less steep than stress migration.
The range in FIT values across applications is also smaller
than that seen in stress migration. The difference between
the worst-case FIT values and application FIT values is also
small.
6 Conclusions
Advances in CMOS semiconductor technology, driven
by aggressive device scaling, have been steadily improv-
ing processor performance. However, CMOS scaling is re-
sulting in escalated power densities and processor temper-
atures, and accelerating the onset of problems due to long-
term processor hardware failures or lifetime reliability.
In this paper, we take a ﬁrst step in establishing the ba-
sic understanding (at the architect’s level) of the reliabil-
ity implications of scaling in the deep-submicron era. Our
results point to potentially large and sharp drops in long-
term reliability, especially beyond 90 nm. Of the failure
modes that were modeled, time-dependent dielectric break-
down (TDDB) and electromigration appear to present the
steepest challenge. Our results also illustrate how scaling
is increasing the difference between failure rates assuming
worst-case conditions vs.
typical operating conditions, as
well as amplifying the differences among different applica-
tions.
Our results present two broad implications. First, it will
become increasingly difﬁcult to leverage a single microar-
chitectural design for multiple remaps across a few tech-
nology generations. Second, the need for workload spe-
ciﬁc, microarchitectural lifetime reliability awareness is il-
lustrated.
