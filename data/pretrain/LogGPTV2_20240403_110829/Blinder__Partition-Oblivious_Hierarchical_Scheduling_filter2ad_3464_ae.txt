ΠH’s preemptions, and accordingly the execution time of τL,1
is adjusted to keep its nominal response time same. We ran
each conﬁguration for 300 seconds with and without Blinder.
As Table 2 shows, τL,1’s response time naturally increases
with the number of ΠH’s preemptions (denoted by #HP) in
both cases. However, the difference of P-RES-NI from P-RES
remains almost constant. Increasing the number of ΠL’s tasks
(denoted by #LA) that arrive at time 44, thus increasing the
size of the arrival queue, does not change the trend. These
results indicate that the overhead due to Blinder’s lag-based
task release is statistically insigniﬁcant and that it is scalable.
7 Related Work
Timing-channels are a major threat to information security
[15, 18]. Microarchitectural timing-channels often involve
shared hardware resources: cache [34], branch predictors [24],
memory banks, TLBs, and interconnects [30]. An attacker usu-
ally either exploits the trace left by other users or overwhelms
the bandwidth. Fuzzy-time [19, 42] introduces noise to sys-
tem clocks so that adversaries cannot obtain precise physical
time. Virtual time approaches [25, 45] enforce execution de-
terminism by providing artiﬁcial time to processes. Although
these techniques can mitigate timing-channels formed from
observing physical time progress, they cannot prevent the sce-
narios presented in this paper because the tasks do not require
any time information to perceive a change in other partition’s
temporal behavior.
Studies have shown that real-time scheduling can leak
information, whether intended or not. Son et al. [38] pro-
vide a mathematical framework for analyzing the existence
and deducibility of covert channels under Rate Monotonic
scheduling. Similarly, Völp et al. [44] address the problem
of information-ﬂows that can be established by altering task
execution behavior. The authors proposed modiﬁcations to
the ﬁxed-priority scheduler to close timing-channels while
achieving real-time guarantees. In [43], Völp et al. also tackle
the issues of information leakage through real-time locking
protocols and proposed transformation for them to prevent un-
intended information leakage. All of these works address the
problem of task-level information leakage, whereas our work
concerns information-ﬂow among time-partitions through
varying partition-level behavior.
Formal veriﬁcation can be used to prove absence of covert
timing-channels. Murray et al. [31] show the non-interference
of Sel4’s time-partitions isolated by a static round-robin sched-
ule. Liu et al. [29] prove that partitions can be dynamically
scheduled, while preserving non-interference, if task arrivals
are always aligned with partition’s activation. Vassena et
al. [41] present a language-level information-ﬂow control

8 Conclusion
Blinder makes partition-local schedules deterministic by
controlling the timing of task release and thus prevents lo-
cal tasks from perceiving other partitions’ varying behav-
ior. We demonstrated that with Blinder, adversaries cannot
form an algorithmic covert timing-channel through a hierar-
chical scheduling even if the system is conﬁgured in the most
favorable way to them. Blinder enables applications to en-
joy the level of ﬂexibility that dynamic partitioning schemes
would achieve while guaranteeing the partition obliviousness
that static approaches would provide. Also, it is backward-
compatible and minimally-intrusive in that no modiﬁcation is
required to the underlying (both global and local) scheduling
mechanisms while incurring statistically insigniﬁcant over-
heads on the scheduler. Therefore, existing systems can bene-
ﬁt from the improved security and resource efﬁciency that it
provides without a complete re-engineering, which is advan-
tageous especially to safety-critical systems that require high
re-certiﬁcation costs.

Appendix A Computation of Bi(ta(τi,x)) in
ShiftRelease
Suppose ShiftRelease occurs at time t, and let τi,x be the
earliest-arrival task in the arrival queue. As shown in Algo-
rithm 7, its arrival time, i.e., ta(τi,x), becomes the beginning of
a new deferred release mode. Here, we compute a new value

for Bdef based on lagi,x that is the remaining lag of τi,x when
the ShiftRelease is happening. ShiftRelease occurs be-
cause lagi,x is a non-zero. That is, the executions released
before τi,x’s arrival (at time ta(τi,x)) is shorter than what is
assumed when calculating the initial lag of τi,x. Hence, from
lagi,x we can ﬁnd how much budget of Πi would have left
for τi,x at its arrival.
We can consider two cases: there had been at least one
budget replenishment before ta(τi,x) or not since entering the
current deferred release mode (i.e., tdef). Figure 27 shows
the former case. In this case, tlastrep is the time instant at
which the last budget replenishment happens before ta(τi,x).
At this moment, the budget is fully replenished to Bi. Now,
Bi(ta(τi,x)) depends on how much of the budget is consumed
by tasks of Πi until ta(τi,x). If no tasks execute since tlastrep,
the full budget Bi would have been available at ta(τi,x). In
this case, lagi,x is longer than min(ta(τi,x) − tlastrep,Bi),
that is, the maximum available time during the interval of
[tlastrep, ta(τi,x)). As lagi,x decreases, less budget becomes
(cid:105)
available. Therefore,
Bi(ta(τi,x)) = Bi −(cid:104)

where [x]0 = max(x,0). If there had been no budget replen-
ishment since tdef, Bi and tlastrep are replaced by Bdef and
