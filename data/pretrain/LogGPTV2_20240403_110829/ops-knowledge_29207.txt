User: I have succeeded in getting ProcessBuilder to run external scripts, but I still have to get Java to communicate with the external scripts. I figure that I should get the input/output streams from the process, and use those to send and receive data. I'm having a the most trouble with giving input to the scripts. It seems that I can get output from the scripts by using the script's print function, but I can't seem to get the scripts to register input from the main java program. 
This question involves four languages, so it's fine if you post only the answer regarding one language.
Assistant: You should probably use a standard interprocess mechanism like a pipe or socket.
All of these languages have libraries available for both, and this strategy allows communication between any 2 of your processes (Java/Ruby, Ruby/Python, Java/C, etc)
