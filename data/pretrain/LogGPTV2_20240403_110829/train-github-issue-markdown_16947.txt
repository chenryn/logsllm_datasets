Our current markdown renderer supports bold, italic, and link formatting. However, I believe there may be an issue with the implementation of bold and italic text. The renderer uses a single asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`) for both bold and italic, instead of the conventional double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`) for bold, and a single asterisk (`*`) or single underscore (`_`) for italic. This inconsistency could lead to confusion, as it deviates from the standard markdown syntax used on platforms like GitHub.
