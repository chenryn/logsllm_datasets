## Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in recent years, profoundly changing people's daily lives. However, this fast-growing technology has also introduced new privacy issues that need to be better understood and measured. In this work, we investigate how private information can be leaked from network traffic generated in smart home networks. Although researchers have proposed techniques to infer IoT device types or user behaviors under clean experimental setups, the effectiveness of such approaches is questionable in complex but realistic network environments where common techniques like Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) are enabled. Traditional methods, such as classical machine-learning models, are less effective under these settings because manually selected features are no longer distinctive.

We propose a traffic analysis framework based on sequence-learning techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which leverage the temporal relations between packets for device identification. We evaluate our framework under different environment settings, including pure-IoT and noisy environments with multiple non-IoT devices. Our results show that our framework can differentiate device types with high accuracy, even when protected by encryption and morphed by the network gateway. This suggests that IoT network communications pose significant challenges to users' privacy, and new privacy protection methods need to be developed to mitigate this issue.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained increasing popularity in recent years and continues to expand into areas such as smart homes, smart cities, industrial systems, and connected health products. According to Forbes, the global IoT market will grow from $157 billion in 2016 to $457 billion by 2020, achieving a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 28.5% [1].

Smart homes are a prominent use case of IoT, where multiple devices work together to facilitate various user activities by sensing surroundings, interpreting human commands, and providing feedback. However, smart homes can introduce new threats to residents' privacy. Since network packets between IoT devices and remote servers can be eavesdropped, a motivated attacker can leverage this data to infer private information about the residents, such as the types of installed IoT devices and their activity status. Leaking such information can have serious consequences, such as a thief breaking into the home when no one is inside by learning the status of an installed smart switch.

This paper aims to assess the privacy threat to smart home residents by evaluating different traffic-analysis approaches on datasets carrying real IoT traffic. While some recent works have investigated privacy issues related to IoT network communications [9, 11, 37], they assume a local adversary or relatively simple network environments. The effectiveness of traffic analysis under a remote adversary or more complex network configurations has not yet been assessed. Specifically, we assume that the gateway may enable configurations common in real-world settings, such as Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT), which can merge traffic flows and erase valuable information from fields like destination ports. Despite these challenges, our study shows that by exploiting the temporal relations between packets, individual devices can be reliably identified.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Related Work
**Network Traffic Classification:** Network traffic analysis has been effective for anomaly detection [25, 46], software identification [10, 33, 34], and individual user fingerprinting [43, 44]. Techniques used in existing applications fall into two main categories: deep packet inspection (DPI) and side-channel inference.

- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** DPI is effective for packet classification and intrusion detection when the network traffic is unencrypted. Bujlow et al. [14] compared six well-known DPI tools and found that commercial DPI tools achieve very good performance in traffic classification. However, DPI-based approaches become ineffective when applied to encrypted traffic.
- **Side-Channel Inference:** Many works have analyzed encrypted traffic using side-channel information and metadata, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and packet sizes [13, 17, 27, 40, 45]. Other side-channel information, such as wireless signal strength and timing, can also be leveraged to infer user activities [38]. Machine learning techniques have shown success in traffic classification. For example, Taylor et al. [42] proposed AppScanner, which extracts statistical features from network flows for classification tasks, achieving up to 99.8% accuracy on 110 apps. Chen et al. [15] proposed an online traffic classification framework using kernel methods and deep neural networks, achieving 99.84% and 88.43% accuracy on five protocols and five mobile applications, respectively. However, these approaches only work in relatively simple network environments without NAT or VPN.

**Traffic Classification in IoT Domain:** With the rapid development of the IoT ecosystem, characterizing and fingerprinting IoT devices has become a trending topic. Recent works on IoT traffic analysis include [11, 12, 29, 30, 35, 37]. Siby et al. [35] captured radio signals emitted from IoT devices and created a system to store and visualize the traffic. Apthorpe et al. [11] performed case studies on four IoT devices, showing they exhibit distinctive traffic features enabling device identification and behavior inference. Marcus et al. [30] extracted 23 features from raw packets, including network protocols from the Link layer to the Application layer, IP options, IP addresses, and ports. However, some of these features are inaccessible in our settings due to adversary capabilities and complex network configurations (NAPT, VPN). Our model uses only 10 features extracted from packet metadata, which are detailed in Section 3. Sivanathan et al. [37] collected network traces of over 20 IoT devices in a campus environment over three weeks, characterizing the profiles of these devices according to their traffic patterns. Their approach relies on extensive feature engineering, which becomes less effective in complex network settings like NAPT and VPN.

### 2.2 Smart Home Network
We assume the network communication within a smart home involves four parties: IoT device, service provider, gateway, and the user. The communication schema is illustrated in Figure 1.

- **IoT Device:** There are two types of IoT devices. The first type senses the surrounding environment and sends notifications to associated listeners, either periodically or immediately when an event occurs. For example, the Samsung ST Motion Sensor detects when a person approaches and notifies other IoT devices. The second type is the IoT hub, which acts as the "brain" (central controller) for other IoT devices in the close range. Both regular IoT devices and IoT hubs can be controlled by user commands sent remotely or locally.
- **Service Provider:** The IoT device interacts with the service provider operated by its manufacturer through internet communications. The service provider handles requests and relays resources. To reduce operational costs, many device vendors have moved their services to public cloud infrastructure, leveraging cloud analytics like AWS IoT Core [2] to process large amounts of IoT data.
- **Gateway:** The gateway serves as a bridge between in-home IoT devices and the remote service provider. A typical gateway (e.g., router) provides two types of interfaces for in-home devices: WLAN and Ethernet.

## 3. Insights and Framework Design
In this section, we present insights into IoT traffic and the design of our framework. We describe the key features extracted from packet metadata and the structure of our LSTM and bidirectional LSTM models.

## 4. Experimental Results
We evaluate our framework under different network configurations (NAPT and VPN) and scenarios (pure-IoT and noisy environments). The results show that our framework achieves high accuracy in these settings, outperforming the baseline Random Forest model due to its ability to model temporal relations between packets.

## 5. Limitations
We discuss the limitations of our work, including potential improvements and future research directions.

## 6. Conclusion
We conclude our study by summarizing the contributions and highlighting the need for new privacy protection methods for IoT traffic.
