### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.32.3]
  * Operating System: [All]
  * Browser: [All]
  * Other info: Typescript version is ^5.0
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Link to the GitHub repository with the repro**
https://github.com/mattjennings/playwright-ts-export-type-bug
**Steps**
  * Run `npm install`
  * Run `npm run typecheck` and note that there are no errors
  * Run `npm run test`
**Expected**
Test runs with no compile errors
**Actual**
`playwright test` errors with:
    Error: /Users/mattjennings/tmp/tspw/tests/utils/index.ts: Unexpected token (1:12)
    > 1 | export type * from './types'
        |             ^
      2 | export { something } from './types'
       at example.spec.ts:2
      1 | import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
    > 2 | import { something } from './utils'
        | ^
      3 |
      4 | test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
      5 |   something()
This syntax is supported as of Typescript 5.0, and Playwright seems to be
using Typescript ^5.0.0, so I'm unsure why this error is thrown.
