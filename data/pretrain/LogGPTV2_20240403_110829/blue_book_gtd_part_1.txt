[Getting things done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done), commonly known as GTD is a task management method created by David Allen and published in a book of the same name.
- 
The GTD method rests on the idea of moving all items of interest, relevant information, issues, tasks and projects out of one's mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items with known time limits. This allows one's attention to focus on taking action on each task listed in an external record, instead of recalling them intuitively.
The method was described by David Allen in a book with the same name. It's clear that the book is the corner stone of David's business. He is selling his method on every word, some times to the point of tiresome. It's also repeats the same ideas on different parts of the book, I guess that's good in terms of sticking an idea in the people's mind, but if you're already convinced and are trying to sum up the book it's like, hey, I have 90% of the valuable contents of this chapter already in my summary. It's obvious too the context of the writer, that the book was written a while ago and who does it write to. It talks quite often about assistants, bosses of high firm companies he's helped, preferring low-tech physical solutions over digital ones, a lot of references about parenting... If you're able to ignore all the above, it's actually a very good book. The guy has been polishing the method for more than 30 years, and has pretty nice ideas that can change how you manage your life.
My idea of this summary is to try to extract the useful ideas removing all those old-fashioned capitalist values from it.
# Theory principles
The theory is based on three key objectives: 
* Capturing all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind.
* Directing yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment.
* Curating and coordinating all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play, at any point in time.
The idea is to have a system with a coherent set of behaviors and tools that:
* Functions effectively at the level at which work really happens. 
* Incorporates the results of big-picture thinking as well as the smallest of open details. 
* Manage multiple tiers of priorities. 
* Maintains control over hundreds of new inputs daily. 
* Save a lot more time and effort than are needed to maintain it. 
* Allows you to maximize your time "in the zone" or "flowing".
## Managing commitments
Most stress comes from inappropriately managed commitments, every one of them, big or little, is being tracked by a less-than-conscious part of you. These are the “incompletes,” or “open loops,” which are anything pulling at your attention that doesn’t belong where it is, the way it is.
In order to deal effectively with all of that, you must first identify and capture all those things that are “ringing your bell” in some way, clarify what, exactly, they mean to you, and then make a decision about how to move on them.
Managing commitments well requires the implementation of some basic activities and behaviors:
* If it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through.
* You must clarify exactly what your commitment is and decide what you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it.
* Once you’ve decided on all the actions you need to take, you must keep reminders of them organized in a system you review regularly.
These "open loops" make you unreliably think many times on the topic without making any progress. This is a waste of time and energy and only adds to your anxiety about what you should be doing and aren't. There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.
## Managing stuff
"stuff" is anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn’t belong where it is, but for which you haven’t yet determined what, exactly, it means to you, with the desired outcome and the next action step. The reason most organizing systems haven’t worked for most people is that they haven’t yet transformed all the stuff they’re trying to organize. As long as it’s still stuff, it’s not controllable.
Almost all of the to-do lists are merely listings of "stuff", not inventories of the resultant real work that needed to be done. They are partial reminders of a lot of things that are unresolved and as yet untranslated into outcomes and actions. Looking at these often creates more stress than relief, because, though it is a valuable trigger for something that you’ve committed to do or decide something about, it still calls out psychologically, “Decide about me!” And if you do not have the energy or focus at the moment to think and decide, it will simply remind you that you are overwhelmed.
The key to managing all of your stuff is managing your *actions*.
What you do with your time, what you do with information, and what you do with your body and your focus relative to your priorities. Those are the real options to which you must allocate your limited resources. The substantive issue is how to make appropriate choices about what to do at any point in time. The real work is to manage our actions.
## Managing actions
You need to control commitments, projects, and actions in two ways:
* Horizontally: Horizontal control maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved. You need a good system that can keep track of as many of them as possible, supply required information about them on demand, and allow you to shift your focus from one thing to the next quickly and easily.
* Vertically: Vertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects. This is “project planning” in the broad sense. It’s focusing in on a single endeavor, situation, or person and fleshing out whatever ideas, details, priorities, and sequences of events may be required for you to handle it, at least for the moment.
## Bottom-Up approach
Intellectually, the most appropriate way ought to be to work from the top down, first uncovering personal and organizational purpose and vision, then defining critical objectives, and finally focusing on the details of implementation. The trouble is, however, that most people are so embroiled in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger horizon is seriously impaired. Consequently, a bottom-up approach is usually more effective.
## Workflow steps
* [Capture what has our attention.](#capture)
* [Clarify what each item means and what to do about it.](#clarify-and-organize)
* [Organize the results.](#clarify-and-organize)
* [Reflect on the options.](#reflect)
* [Engage the chosen options.](#engage)
### Capture
It’s important to know what needs to be captured and how to do that most effectively so you can process it appropriately. In order for your mind to let go of the lower-level task of trying to hang on to everything, you have to know that you have truly captured everything that might represent something you have to do or at least decide about, and that at some point in the near future you will process and review all of it.
In order to eliminate “holes in your bucket,” you need to collect and gather placeholders for, or representations of, all the things you consider incomplete in your world: anything personal or professional, big or little, of urgent or minor importance, that you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing.
To manage this inventory of open loops appropriately, you need to capture it into “containers” that hold items in abeyance until you have a few moments to decide what they are and what, if anything, you’re going to do about them. Then you must empty these containers regularly to ensure that they remain viable capture tools.
There are several types of tools, both low and high tech, that can be used to collect your open loops. The following can all serve as versions of an in-tray, capturing self-generated input as well as information from external sources:
* Physical in-tray
* Paper-based note-taking devices
* Digital/audio note-taking devices
* E-mail and text messaging
You'll probably need to choose a variety of tools to fulfill the different inputs of your life, these should become part of your lifestyle. Keep them close by so no matter where you are you can collect a potentially valuable thought. You should have as many in-trays as you need and as few as you can get by with. If you have too many collection zones, however, you won’t be able to process them easily or consistently.
That's one of the key points of your capture tools, if you don’t empty and process the stuff you’ve collected, your tools aren’t serving any function other than the storage of amorphous material. Emptying the contents does not mean that you have to finish what’s there; it just means that you have to decide more specifically what it is and what should be done with it, and if it’s still unfinished, organize it into your system. You must get it out of the container. 
In order to get your “inbox” to empty, however, an integrated life-management system must be in place. Too much stuff is left piled in in-trays (physical and digital) because of a lack of effective systems downstream.
### Clarify and organize
This is the component of input management that forms the basis for your personal organisation. It's basically thinking about the item and following the next diagram:
![](gtd-clarify-diagram.png)
Remember to follow the next rules while processing the items:
- Process the top item first: that way you treat each element equally, so the "least" important ones are not left dangling forever in your inbox thus thwarting it's purpose. 
- Process one item at a time.
- Never put anything back into “in.”
For each element you need to ask yourself: "What's the next action?".
If you don't see any then refile the element to:
* Trash: Throw away, shred, or recycle anything that has no potential future action or reference value. If you leave this stuff mixed in with other categories, it will seriously undermine the system and your clarity in the environment.
* Someday/Maybe: Here goes the elements that don't have next actions now but may have them in the future. This is the “parking lot” for projects that would be impossible to move on at present but that you don’t want to forget about entirely. You’d like to be reminded of the possibility at regular intervals (probably on your weekly reviews). You can also think this as the backlog. Here also belongs other types of information that only needs to be reviewed when you have an urge to engage in a particular kind of activity such as lists like books to read, web sites to surf, trips to do, things to do, recipes to try... Only if you want to review them often to expand your options for creative exploration, otherwise they belong to the References.
* References are the rest of information that that requires no action but have intrinsic value as information such as your [digital garden](digital_garden.md) or technical books.
  Reference systems generally take two forms: 
  * Topic and area specific storage: 
  * General reference files: Stores ad hoc information that doesn’t belong in some predesigned larger category. 
If you can do something about the element, you need to think which is the next physical, visible activity that would be required to move the situation towards closure. It's tricky, something like "set meeting" won't do because it's not descriptive of physical behaviour. There is still stuff to decide how, when, with whom, if you don't do it now you won't empty your head and the uncertainty will create a psychological gap that will make you procrastinate, so define the next action now. "Decide what to do about X" doesn't work either, you may need to gather more information on the topic, but deciding doesn't take time. 
Once you have the next action, if it can be done in two minutes or less, do it when you first pick the item up. Even if it is not a high-priority one, do it now if you’re ever going to do it at all. The rationale for the two-minute rule is that it’s more or less the point where it starts taking longer to store and track an item than to deal with it the first time it’s in your hands. Two minutes is just a guideline. If you have a long open window of time in which to process your in-tray, you can extend the cutoff for each item to five or ten minutes. If you’ve got to get to the bottom of all your input rapidly, then you may want to shorten the time to one minute, or even thirty seconds, so you can get through everything a little faster. 
There’s nothing you really need to track about your two-minute actions. Just do them. If, however, you take an action and don’t finish the project with that one action, you’ll need to clarify what’s next on it, and manage that according to the same criteria. 
If the next action is going to take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, “Am I the best person to be doing it?” If not, hand it off to the appropriate person, in order of priority:
* Send an e-mail.
* Write a note or an over-note on paper and route it to that person.
* Send it a instant message.
* Add it as an agenda item on a list for your next real-time conversation with that person.
* Talk with her directly, either face-to-face or by phone.
When you hand it off to someone else, and if you care at all whether something happens as a result, you’ll need to track it. Depending on how active you need to be it can go to your Waiting list or to your tickler.
You need to determine what to do with the rest of the next actions once you do, they will end up in one of the next containers:
* [Todo list](#todo-list)
* [Calendar](#calendar)
* [Tickler](#tickler)
I's critical that all of these containers be kept distinct from one another. They each represent a discrete type of agreement we make with ourselves, to be reminded of at a specific time and in a specific way, and if they lose their edges and begin to blend, much of the value of organizing will be lost. That's why capturing and clarifying what your relationship to them is primary to getting organized.
#### Todo list
This list contains all the next actions and projects you are going to actively work on. Projects are any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step. This means that some rather small things you might not normally call projects are going to be on your Projects list, as well as some big ones. If one step won’t complete something, some kind of goalpost needs to be set up to remind you that there’s something still left to do. If you don’t have a placeholder to remind you about it, it will slip back into your head. The reason for the one-year time frame is that anything you are committed to finish within that scope needs to be reviewed weekly to feel comfortable about its status. Another way to think of this is as a list of open loops, no matter what the size. This is going to be one of the lists that you'll review more often, and it needs to be manageable, if the items start to grow you may want to track the elements you want to do in the semester, or trimester.
Projects do not initially need to be listed in any particular order, by size, or by priority. They just need to be on a master list so you can review them regularly enough to ensure that appropriate next actions have been defined for each of them. That being said, I like to order them a little bit so that I don't need to read the whole list to choose what to do.
There may be reasons to sort your projects into different subcategories, based upon different areas of your focus, but initially creating a single list of all of them will make it easier to customize your system appropriately as you get more comfortable with its usage. To sort them use tags instead of hierarchical structures, they are more flexible. For example you could use tags for:
- Context: Where can you do the element: `home`, `computer`, `mobile`, ...
- Area: Broad categories where the element falls in: `activism`, `caring`, `self-caring`, `home`, `digital services`, ...
- Type: I like to separate the tasks that are meant to survive (`maintenance`) from the ones that are meant to improve things (`improvement`)
- Mood, energy level, time: It's useful to have a quick way to see the tasks you can work on when you don't have that much time (`small`), you don't have that much mental energy (`brainless`), when you're `sad`, ...
For many of your projects, you will accumulate relevant information that you will want to organize by theme or topic or project name. Your Projects list will be merely an index. All of the details, plans, and supporting information that you may need as you work on your various projects should be contained in your References system.
#### Calendar
The calendar holds reminders of actions you need to take fall into two categories: those about things that have to happen on a specific day or time, and those about things that just need to get done as soon as possible. Your calendar handles the first type of reminder.
These things go on your calendar:
* Time-Specific actions or appointments.
* Day-Specific actions: These are things that you need to do sometime on a certain day, but not necessarily at a specific time. 
* Day-Specific information: Information that may be useful on a certain date. This might include directions for appointments, activities that other people will be involved in then, or events of interest. It’s helpful to put short-term tickler information here, too, such as a reminder to call someone after he or she returns from vacation. This is also where you would want to park important reminders about when something might be due, or when something needs to be started, given a determined lead time.
Daily to-do lists don't belong to the calendar because:
* Constant new input and shifting tactical priorities reconfigure daily work so consistently that it’s virtually impossible to nail down to-do items ahead of time. Having a working game plan as a reference point is always useful, but it must be able to be renegotiated at any moment. Trying to keep a list on the calendar, which must then be reentered on another day if items don’t get done, is demoralizing and a waste of time. The Next Actions lists will hold all of those action reminders, even the most time-sensitive ones. And they won’t have to be rewritten daily.
* If there’s something on a daily to-do list that doesn’t absolutely have to get done that day, it will dilute the emphasis on the things that truly do. The calendar should be sacred territory. If you write something there, it must get done that day or not at all. 
That said, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with creating a quick, informal, short list of “if I have time, I’d really like to . . .” kinds of things, picked from your Next Actions inventory. It just should not be confused with your “have-tos,” and it should be treated lightly enough to discard or change quickly as the inevitable surprises of the day unfold.
### Reflect
This is where you take a look at all your outstanding projects and open loops. It’s your chance to scan all the defined actions and options before you, thus radically increasing the efficacy of the choices you make about what you’re doing at any point in time.
The item you’ll probably review most frequently is your calendar, which will remind you about what things truly have to be handled that day. This doesn’t mean that the contents there are the most “important” in some grand sense, only that they must get done. At any point in time, knowing what has to get done and when creates a terrain for maneuvering. It’s a good habit, as soon as you conclude an action on your calendar, to check and see what else remains to be done.
Review whatever lists, overviews, and orientation maps you need to, as often as you need to, to get their contents off your mind.
After checking your calendar, you’ll most often turn to your Next Action lists. These hold the inventory of predefined actions that you can take if you have any discretionary time during the day. If you’ve organized them by context (At Home; At Computer; In Meeting with George) they’ll come into play only when those contexts are available.
Projects, Waiting For, and Someday/Maybe lists need to be reviewed only as often as you think they have to be in order to stop you from wondering about them with a minimum recurrence of once each week.
### Engage
The basic purpose of this workflow management process is to facilitate good choices about what you’re doing at any point in time and feel good about it. The idea is to use your intuition on the information you have captured, clarified, organized, and reflected regarding all your current commitments. 
First you need to get an awareness of your state. At any point in time you're limited to do the tasks that meet your:
* Context: Most actions need to be done on a specific location or having some tool at hand. You can use tags to filter the actions available to your context.
* Time available.
* Energy available.
Then you need to decide what type of task you want to do:
* Predefined tasks: Dealing with tasks that you have previously determined need to be done, items of your calendar and Next actions list.
* Unplanned tasks: Often things come up ad hoc, unsuspected and unforeseen that you either have to or choose to engage in as they occur. When you follow these leads, you’re deciding by default that these things are more important than anything else you have to do at those times.
* Managing the task system: This entails following the earlier steps of the workflow: capturing stuff, clarifying, organizing and reflecting. As you process your inputs, you’ll no doubt be taking care of some less-than-two-minute actions and tossing and filing numerous things. A good portion of this activity will consist of identifying things that need to get done sometime, but not right away. You’ll be adding to all of your lists as you go along.
And finally decide which one to do based on your priority. Defining priority is a hard task that often involves looking towards the "big picture". The idea is to scale up the abstraction tree below to help you decide:
* Task level: This is the accumulated list of all the actions you need to take.
* Project level: Group of tasks that share a relatively short-term outcome you want to achieve.
* Area level: These are the key areas of your life within which you want to achieve results and maintain standards such as health, social, learning, home, recreation, finances, etc. These are not things to finish but rather to use as criteria for assessing our experiences and our engagements, to maintain balance and sustainability as we live. Listing and reviewing these responsibilities gives a more comprehensive framework for evaluating your inventory of projects.
* Goal level: What specific achievements you want to meet in the different areas of your life one to two years from now will add another dimension to prioritize your tasks. 
* Vision level: Projecting three to five years into the future generates thinking about bigger categories: organization strategies, environmental trends, career and lifestyle transition circumstances. Internal factors include longer-term career, family, financial, and quality-of-life aspirations and considerations. 
* Purpose and Principles: This is the big-picture view. The primary purpose for anything provides the core definition of what it really is. All goals, visions, objectives, projects, and actions derive from this, and lead toward it.
In real life the important conversations you will have about your focus and your priorities may not exactly fit one level or another. They can provide a useful framework, however, to remind you of the multilayered nature of your commitments and tasks.
Setting priorities in the traditional sense of focusing on your long-term goals and values, though obviously a necessary core focus, does not provide a practical framework for a vast majority of the decisions and tasks you must engage in day to day. Mastering the flow of your work at all the levels you experience that work provides a much more holistic way to get things done and feel good about it.
