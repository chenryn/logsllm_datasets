I am experiencing an issue with the standalone Embedding Projector, where the "_Load bookmarks_" window no longer opens. However, the "_Save bookmarks_" function and all other features continue to work as expected. 

I am using Windows 7 Enterprise and my browser is Google Chrome, version 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit), which is on the Stable channel.
