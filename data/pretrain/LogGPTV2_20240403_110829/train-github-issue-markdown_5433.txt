On a fresh Julia 0.3 install on windows 8.1, I get this odd behaviour, where
size(A) indicates that the 3rd and 4th dimensions are of size 0, when A is an
array of dimension 3 or 4. This is illustrated below:
    julia> size(ones(2))
    (2,)
    julia> size(ones(2,3))
    (2,3)
    julia> size(ones(2,3,4))
    (2,3,0)
    julia> size(ones(2,3,4,5))
    (2,3,0,0)
    julia> size(ones(2,3,4,5, 6))
    (2,3,4,5,6)
Interestingly, the correct result is returned when an axis is specified:
    julia> size(ones(2,3,4))
    (2,3,0)
    julia> size(ones(2,3,4), 3)
    4
