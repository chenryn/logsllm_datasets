User: I'm writing a script which will have to work on directories which are modified by hand by Windows and Linux users alike. The Windows users tend to not care at all about case in assigning filenames.
Is there a way to handle this on the Linux side in Python, i.e. can I get a case-insensitive, glob-like behaviour?
Assistant: Depending on your case, you might use .lower() on both file pattern and results from folder listing and only then compare the pattern with the filename
