## Abstract
With the increasing development of pervasive computing and wireless communication, mobile devices are increasingly used to access sensitive data stored on remote servers. A key challenge in such applications is how to leverage the server's resources to enforce fine-grained access control over remotely stored files while enabling resource-limited mobile devices to easily access the protected data, especially when the storage server is untrusted. This challenge arises from the asymmetric capacities among participants, i.e., the limited capacity of mobile devices and the abundant resources of the server (and file owners with fixed computers).

To address this, we propose a new encryption paradigm called Asymmetric Cross-Cryptosystem Re-encryption (ACCRE). In ACCRE, lightweight Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) is deployed on mobile devices, while resource-intensive but versatile Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is used on servers and fixed computers. The core of ACCRE is a novel ciphertext conversion mechanism that allows an authorized proxy to convert a complex IBBE ciphertext into a simple IBE ciphertext that mobile devices can handle, without leaking any sensitive information to the proxy.

We present an efficient ACCRE scheme with its security formally reduced to the security of the underlying IBE and IBBE schemes. Thorough theoretical analyses and extensive experiments confirm that our scheme imposes very small computational costs on mobile devices and is practical for secure mobile computing applications.

## 1. Introduction
Advances in information and wireless communication technologies have led to the widespread use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets for accessing outsourced data (e.g., cloud storage). Users can leverage these portable devices to access data maintained by third parties through the internet or wireless communication. For example, outdoor users can access their private photos or videos, doctors can make timely diagnoses with mobile access to patient records, and employees can process sensitive company business via cloud services.

Data security is a primary concern in such applications. Outsourced data are typically encrypted to prevent untrusted storage servers from accessing sensitive content. Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is appealing to resource-abundant data owners as it allows them to enforce fine-grained and flexible access control. In contrast, Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) is more suitable for mobile devices due to its lightweight nature and simplicity.

However, there is a clear gap in these applications. File owners with powerful computing devices (e.g., desktops) prefer to use IBBE for flexible access control, while mobile users with capacity-constrained devices prefer IBE for accessing the data. This raises the question: Can we design a security mechanism that enables IBE-equipped devices to directly access IBBE-encrypted files?

Consider a mobile office application where employees use unique identities and IBBE on their desktops to share data. An employee, Alice, can securely share her data with a group, allowing all members to access it simultaneously. Another employee, Bob, works outside the office using a mobile device. When Bob requests access to Alice's IBBE-encrypted data, a more elegant solution is needed to process the previously encrypted data so that it is decryptable by Bob.

Proxy Re-encryption (PRE) [1] is a potential solution. Identity-based PRE schemes [14, 9] allow a proxy to convert an IBE ciphertext for one user into a ciphertext for another, but they do not support the required "broadcasting" mechanism. Other solutions, such as computation outsourcing [36] and ciphertext delegation [33], also aim to convert complex ciphertexts into simpler ones but have limitations in terms of efficiency and flexibility.

What is needed is an Asymmetric Cross-Cryptosystem Re-encryption (ACCRE) that bridges the gap between IBBE and IBE. This re-encryption mechanism allows a data owner to delegate access rights to an IBE-equipped user without requiring the data owner to know the target user's identity in advance or leak sensitive information.

## 2. Related Work
Data security in data outsourcing applications is a major concern. Various cryptographic techniques have been proposed, including SSL for securing medical records [32], IBE for body sensor networks [35], IBBE for multi-user access [11], hierarchical IBBE for key delegation [27], and key-aggregate cryptosystems for cloud storage [8]. 

Mobile access to encrypted data must consider the low computing capability of mobile devices. Techniques such as network coding [38], online/offline IBE [26, 7, 6], and exponentiation outsourcing [36] have been proposed to reduce computational overheads. Ciphertext delegation [33] and hierarchical ABE [12] also aim to reduce decryption complexity but have limitations in terms of access rights delegation and computational burden.

Proxy Re-encryption (PRE) is a useful tool for transforming ciphertexts. Unidirectional PRE schemes [1, 17, 25, 30, 37] and identity-based PRE [14] have been developed, but they do not fully address the needs of our motivating scenario.

## 3. System Framework and Model
In this section, we describe the system framework and model for our ACCRE scheme. The ACCRE system involves an IBBE system and an IBE system that operate independently in their standard ways. When a user wants to share data, they encrypt it with the set of receiver identities and outsource the IBBE-encrypted file to a storage service provider. To authorize a mobile user, the data owner generates a conversion key and gives it to a proxy. The proxy uses this key to convert the IBBE-encrypted file into an IBE-encrypted file, which the mobile user can then access using their IBE decryption key.

We define a semantic security notion for ACCRE, allowing the adversary to query conversion keys. Even with this additional power, the adversary should not be able to distinguish the ciphertexts of the attacker's choice.

## 4. Proposed Scheme
We propose a provably secure ACCRE scheme with short ciphertexts and secret keys. The main challenge is the asymmetric structures of IBBE and IBE ciphertexts. We address this by introducing a key blinding technique and constructing the ACCRE scheme on variants of IBE [3] and IBBE [10]. This ensures that the proxy can safely perform the conversion without leaking the secret key or the digital contents of the original file, even if the proxy colludes with unauthorized users.

## 5. Security Analysis
We formally prove the security of our ACCRE scheme, reducing it to the security of the underlying IBE and IBBE schemes. Our analysis confirms that the scheme is secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks.

## 6. Performance Evaluation
We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation, both theoretically and experimentally. The results show that a mobile user incurs negligible cost to decrypt a converted ciphertext compared to an IBBE ciphertext. The costs for conversion key generation and file conversion are also manageable for more powerful computing devices. These features make our ACCRE a promising solution for secure mobile access to outsourced data.

## 7. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the concept of Asymmetric Cross-Cryptosystem Re-encryption (ACCRE) to bridge the gap between IBBE and IBE systems. Our scheme enables efficient and secure mobile access to outsourced data, addressing the challenges of asymmetric capacities among participants. Theoretical and experimental results confirm the practicality and security of our approach.
