ABSTRACT
With the increasing development of pervasive computing
and wireless bandwidth communication, more mobile de-
vices are used to access sensitive data stored in remote servers.
In such applications, a practical issue emerges such as how to
exploit the suﬃcient resource of a server so that the ﬁle own-
ers can enforce ﬁne-grained access control over the remotely
stored ﬁles, while enable resource-limited mobile devices to
easily access the protected data, especially if the storage
server maintained by a third party is untrusted. This chal-
lenge mainly arises from the asymmetric capacity among
the participants, i.e., the capacity limited mobile devices
and the resource abundant server (and ﬁle owners equipped
with ﬁxed computers). To meet the security requirements in
mobile access to sensitive data, we propose a new encryption
paradigm, referred to as asymmetric cross-cryptosystem re-
encryption (ACCRE) by leveraging the asymmetric capac-
ity of the participants. In ACCRE, relatively light-weight
identity-based encryption (IBE) is deployed in mobile de-
vices, while resource-consuming but versatile identity-based
broadcast encryption (IBBE) is deployed in servers and ﬁxed
computers of the ﬁle owners. The core of ACCRE is a novel
ciphertext conversion mechanism that allows an authorized
proxy to convert a complicated IBBE ciphertext into a sim-
ple IBE ciphertext aﬀordable to mobile devices, without
leaking any sensitive information to the proxy. Following
this paradigm, we propose an eﬃcient ACCRE scheme with
its security formally reduced to the security of the underly-
ing IBE and IBBE schemes. Thorough theoretical analyses
and extensive experiments conﬁrm that the scheme takes
.
very small cost for mobile devices to access encrypted data
and is practical to secure mobile computing applications.

INTRODUCTION
With pervasive advances in information and wireless com-
munication technologies, mobile devices such as smart phones
and tablets have been widely used in data outsourced sys-
tems (e.g., cloud storage [8]) to access the outsourced data.
In such applications, users can leverage their potable de-
vices to access the data maintained by a third party through
Internet or wireless communication. For instance, outdoor
users can use mobile phones to access their private photos or
videos outsourced from their desktops at home; doctors can
make timely diagnoses with mobile access to the patients’
electronic health records [20] and in mobile oﬃce, employees
may use their tablets to process sensitive company business
assigned by their managers in oﬃces via cloud computing
services.
Data security is one of the main concerns in such appli-
cations. Outsourced data are usually encrypted [19] to pre-
vent untrusted storage servers from knowing the sensitive
contents. Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) [10]
is especially appealing to resource-abundant data owners as
it allows the owners to enforce ﬁne-grained and ﬂexible pre-
cise access control over the outsourced data by specifying
which users can access what digital contents. In contrast,
identity-based encryption (IBE) [3] is especially interesting
to mobile devices due to its almost light-weight feature and
freeness of complicated public-key certiﬁcates.
Now we encounter a clear gap in such applications. The
ﬁle owners having powerful computing devices such as desk-
top computers would like to employ resource-consuming but
versatile IBBE [11] to enforce ﬂexible access control over
their outsourced data [16]. However, the mobile users with
capacity-constraint computing devices would like to deploy
resource-saving IBE to access the outsourced data. Then
a natural question arises: Can we design a security mech-
anism enabling devices equipped with IBE to access IBBE
encrypted ﬁles directly?
Consider a mobile oﬃce application in which the above
problem may be realistic. The employees are associated
with unique identities and their desktop computers in of-
ﬁces are equipped with an identity-based broadcast encryp-
tion (IBBE) system to protect data security. Under IBBE,
the employee Alice can securely share her data with a group
of employees so that all the employees can simultaneously
access the same data. On the other hand, another employee
Bob works outside his oﬃces and processes data by using
mobile devices such as iPads or Android tablets. At some
point, Bob also requests to access the data encrypted by Al-
ice. Unfortunately, the data has already been encrypted as
an IBBE ciphertext and Alice (or any other employees able
to access the encrypted data) may not want to decrypt the
IBBE encrypted data and then encrypt it to Bob using the
IBE encryption. A more elegant approach is required for
precessing the previously encrypted data so that it is also
decryptable by Bob.
A plausible solution to the above application might be
proxy re-encryption (PRE) [1]. We note that identity-based
PRE schemes [14, 9] allow a proxy to convert an IBE ci-
phertext for one user into a ciphertext for another user, but
they do not support the required “broadcasting” mechanism
for Alice.
In view of limited resources of mobile devices,
other solutions also try to convert a complicated ciphertext
into a simple one so that mobile devices can easily access.
The computation outsourcing techniques [36] enable mobile
devices to outsource large computation tasks in decrypting
complicated ciphertexts. However, these techniques require
the mobile users to interact with a computing server for
help to complete the computation tasks whenever the mo-
bile users need to decrypt a ciphertext, which is ineﬃcient
due to the frequent interactions with the computing server.
The ciphertext delegation approach [33] is also a kind of
encrypted data conversion but only allows a ciphertext for
an access policy to be “re-encrypted” to a more restrictive
policy, which is not necessary to reduce the computation
overheads of the target decryptor. Furthermore, it requires
Alice to know the identity of Bob when encrypting, which
is opposite to the above motivating scenario.
Indeed, what needed is an asymmetric cross-cryptosystem
re-encryption that bridges an IBBE system to be employed
for powerful computing devices and an IBE system to be em-
ployed for resource-limited mobile devices. The re-encryption
mechanism allows a data owner to delegate the access rights
of the IBBE encrypted data to a user having an IBE de-
cryption key, without requiring the data owner to know the
identity of the target user in advance nor leaking any sen-
sitive information about the original digital contents to any
unauthorized user.
rithms, which inevitably makes it challenging to formalize
its security deﬁnition and realize practical ACCRE schemes.
We present a framework of the ACCRE and deﬁne its se-
curity. The ACCRE system involves an IBBE system and
an IBE system that work independently in their standard
ways. When a user wants to share his data with others, the
user can encrypt the data with the set of identities of the
receivers and then outsource the resulting IBBE encrypted
ﬁle to a storage service provider. Later, the user may also
want to authorize a mobile user to access his data. Instead of
downloading and decrypting the encrypted ﬁle, the user just
generates a conversion key without any help of the mobile
user and then gives this key to a proxy. The proxy applies
this key to convert the user’s IBBE encrypted ﬁle into an
IBE encrypted ﬁle so that the mobile user can access us-
ing his normal IBE decryption key. We deﬁne a semantic
security notion for ACCRE. Due to the conversion feature,
the adversary is allowed to additionally query the conversion
keys. We require even such an adversary cannot distinguish
the ciphertexts of the messages of the attacker’s choice.
We propose a provably secure ACCRE scheme with short
ciphertexts and secret keys. One challenge is the asymmet-
ric structures of an IBBE ciphertext and an IBE one. An
IBBE ciphertext is associated with multiple identities while
that of IBE is associated with only one. It is hard to replace
the identities involved in the original ciphertext with a sin-
gle identity, without disclosing any information about the
encrypted data. We address this challenge by proposing a
key blinding technique and constructing the ACCRE scheme
on a variant of the IBE scheme [3] and the IBBE scheme [10].
With the key blinding technique, one can safely entrust the
proxy with the conversion task without leaking one’s secret
key or the digital contents of the original ﬁle, even if the
proxy colludes with unauthorized users.
We carry out a thorough analysis of the proposed ACCRE
scheme. Its security is formally reduced to the security of
the underling IBBE and IBE schemes. We also perform a
comprehensive performance evaluation. Both the theoretical
analysis and the experimental results conﬁrm that a mobile
user takes negligible cost to decrypt a converted ciphertext,
compared to that to decrypt an IBBE one. The costs for
conversion key generation and ﬁle conversion are also less for
more powerful computing devices. These features renders
our ACCRE a promising solution to secure mobile access to
outsourced data.

2. RELATED WORK
In this paper, we introduce and formalize a new concept of
asymmetric cross-cryptosystem re-encryption (ACCRE) to
convert encrypted data for resource-asymmetric computing
devices. The ACCRE seems an amazing and useful crypto-
graphic tool in practice. However, it involves two separate
encryption systems (IBBE and IBE) with very diﬀerent pa-
rameters, e.g., public keys, secret keys, and respective algo-
Data security is a major concern in data outsourcing ap-
plications. Pavlovi´c and Miklavˇciˇc [32] adopted the secure
socket layer (SSL) protocol to secure sensitive digital med-
ical records transmitted through Internet. Tan et al.
[35]
employed IBE in body sensor networks to protect the sen-
sitive health information outsourced to doctors. Deng et
al. [11] employed IBBE to protect data security and allows
multiple users to access the same outsourced data, which, to
one’s interest, allows a trusted third party to trace corrupted
users. Liu et al. [27] suggested hierarchical IBBE in which
the key generation and distribution can be delegated to one’s
subordinates. Chu et al. [8] proposed a key-aggregate cryp-
tosystem to secure data outsourced to cloud storage systems
and Li et al. applied the ﬂexible attribute-based encryp-
tion (ABE) to protect the privacy of outsourced personal
health records. Liu et al.
[28] enhanced chosen-plaintext
secure ABE with adaptively chosen ciphertext security at a
marginal cost. The leakage tracing mechanism was further
realized in cloud storage with ABE for ﬁne-grained access
control [13].
Mobile access to encrypted data needs to take into con-
sideration the low computing capability of mobile devices.
Zhang et al.
[38] leveraged network coding to reduce the
energy consumed by data encryption in mobile ad hoc net-
works. Liu, Chu and Chow [26, 7, 6] used the concept of
online/oﬄine in IBE setting to oﬄoad the heavy computa-
tion into a third party. Hwu et al.
[16] employed IBE on
mobile devices to eliminate the overheads of the authentic-
ity of public keys. Wang et al. [36] proposed an exponenti-
ation outsourcing to reduce the computation complexity in
decryption, although it requires the help of a third party.
To reduce the complicated computations of mobile users in
decrypting ABE ciphertexts, Green et al. [15] proposed an
outsourcing technique that allows a mobile user to outsource
a majority of decryption computation to a third party. Their
scheme mainly focuses on the reduction of decryption com-
putation and does not consider the access rights delegation
from one to another. Recently, Sahai et al. [33] provides a
ciphertext delegation that can convert an ABE ciphertext
for an access policy into a ciphertext for a more restrictive
one. Since IBBE and IBE can be roughly viewed as spe-
cial cases of ABE, one may attempt to apply Sahai et al.’s
solution to the motivating scenario to convert a ciphertext
for an access set of multiple identities into a ciphertext for a
single identity. However, due to the requirement that only
more restrictive access policy can be delegated to, this solu-
tion requires the identity regarding the converted ciphertext
to be appear in the access set in advance, which would be
undesirable for the application. Deng et al.
[12] recently
propose hierarchical ABE so that the key generation can be
delegated to lower level users and relieve the burden of the
high-hierarchy users. But their scheme does not relieve the
computation burden of the decryptors. Our scheme does not
fall into such restrictions since it applies a diﬀerent tech-
nique, proxy re-encryption. Further, our scheme directly
employs the eﬃcient IBE on mobile users, thus there is no
need to reduce the decryption computation any more.
Proxy re-encryption (PRE), ﬁrst formulated by Blaze et
al. [2], is a useful cryptographic tool that can transform a
ciphertext for a public key into a ciphertext for another pub-
lic key. As remarked in [1], Blaze et al.’s scheme is inherent
bidirectional, that is, the re-encryption key allows translat-
ing ciphertexts not only from Alice to Bob, but also from
Bob to Alice. Ivan and Dodis [17] constructed a unidirec-
tional proxy encryption by splitting a decryption key into
two parts, one of which is for the proxy and the other is for
Bob. This scheme protects delegatee’s security, although
requires the delegatee Bob to store additional secrets be-
fore being delegated to. Following Ivan and Dodis’s work,
Ateniese et al.
[1] proposed a unidirectional PRE scheme
that eliminates the storage need of extra secrets before re-
encryption. Canetti and Hohenberger [5] improved Ateniese
et al.’s schemes to be chosen-ciphertext secure, although this
scheme is bidirectional. Subsequently, Libert and Vergnaud
[25] presented the ﬁrst replayable chosen-ciphertext secure
unidirectional PRE scheme in the standard model. Mat-
suda et al.
[30] introduced a new primitive referred to as
re-applicable lossy trapdoor function and applied this func-
tion to achieve a chosen-ciphertext secure PRE scheme in
the standard model. Weng et al. [37] made a careful obser-
vation on the Matsuda et al.’s scheme and indicated some
dissatisfactions of the security.
There are some extensions of PRE to support identity-
based cryptosystem. Green and Ateniese [14] extended the
PRE to support identity-based encryption, resulting into an
identity-based proxy re-encryption (IBPRE). In an IBPRE
scheme, the identity of a user plays the role of a tradi-
tional public key and in re-encryption, a ciphertext under an
