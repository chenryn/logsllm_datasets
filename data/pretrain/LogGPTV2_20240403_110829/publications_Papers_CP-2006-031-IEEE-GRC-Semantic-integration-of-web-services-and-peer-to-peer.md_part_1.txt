### Semantic Integration of Web Services and Peer-to-Peer Networks to Achieve Fault Tolerance

**Jorge Cardoso**

**Abstract:**
One fundamental requirement for critical web services is a high level of availability. With the advancement of web services, significant technological progress has been made in leveraging the semantic web to automate data and application integration. This paper presents the Whisper architecture, which integrates web services with a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure to enhance service availability. Whisper achieves transparent fault tolerance by automatically forwarding web service requests to semantically equivalent peers that are dynamically located, selected, and invoked.

### I. Introduction

The vision of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) promises a highly flexible approach to building complex information systems. SOAs can rely on web services to facilitate more efficient application integration and improve business process accessibility for customers and partners. However, current web service specifications do not provide support for handling service failures or preventing downtime. Therefore, it is essential to develop solutions to increase the fault tolerance of SOA-based web services. This paper describes the design and implementation of our fault-tolerant architecture called Whisper, which uses emerging technologies such as the semantic web, web services, and P2P networks to build the next generation of service-oriented systems.

### II. Web Services, JXTA Architecture, and Fault Tolerance

#### A. Do Web Services Support Fault Tolerance?

Web services do not natively support fault tolerance; they only provide mechanisms for error handling. Web services consist of a messaging layer and a service description layer, standardized to ensure interoperability with the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). At the messaging layer, SOAP provides an `<Fault>` tag to inform clients about errors encountered during message processing. Similarly, WSDL includes the `<Fault>` tag to specify the abstract message format for any errors resulting from remote operation invocations. While these mechanisms help handle application-level errors, they do not address system-level failures [2].

#### B. Implementing Fault Tolerance Using JXTA

In our implementation, we chose the JXTA infrastructure to deploy a fault-tolerant P2P back-end architecture due to its dynamic nature, the concept of peer groups, and its decentralized model.

1. **Dynamic Networks:** JXTA networks are inherently dynamic. Peers can join or leave the network at different times, allowing for the dynamic increase in the availability of web services by having more peers responsible for executing service requests.
   
2. **Peer Groups:** Peer groups are crucial for the Whisper architecture as they enable the implementation of semantically equivalent peers. Peers within a given group implement the same functionality, possibly in different ways.

3. **Decentralization:** Web services are based on a centralized model, while JXTA computing is decentralized. The decentralized model naturally supports self-healing and resilient architectures through redundancy, which is how Whisper achieves fault tolerance.

#### C. Fault Tolerance and Redundancy

Redundancy has long been used to increase the availability of distributed systems. In Whisper, redundancy is achieved through the replication of business process functionalities. Typically, an application's logic and data are distributed across a cluster of computer systems to tolerate single hardware or software faults. Whisper uses static redundancy, where all replicas implementing services are active simultaneously. If one replica fails, another is elected using the Bully algorithm, ensuring minimal impact on response time. This approach allows web service invocations to be forwarded to peers in different computers and networks, enhancing both fault tolerance and scalability.

### III. Architecture

To facilitate understanding, we describe a running scenario illustrated in Figure 1. The application has two web services: 'Register Student' and 'Student Information'. The 'Register Student' service stores student data in a relational database and returns the student ID. The 'Student Information' service retrieves and returns student data based on the provided ID. The actual implementation of these services is provided by a JXTA network of peers, each belonging to a semantic peer group. When a web service is invoked, Whisper dynamically locates a semantic peer group capable of processing the request.

#### A. Semantic Web Services

Traditional web services are described using WSDL, which provides only syntactic information. This poses a problem for automatic discovery of peer groups, leading to high recall and low precision during searches [5]. Researchers have advocated for semantically enabled web services to develop distributed applications over the web [6-8]. Semantics, articulated through ontologies, allow a rich description of web services, enabling automated integration and management. In Whisper, web services are semantically annotated following the WSDL-S specification [9], and JXTA peer groups are also semantically defined.

With the help of ontologies, the semantics or meaning of service data and functionality can be clearly defined, facilitating automated integration and management of distributed applications.
