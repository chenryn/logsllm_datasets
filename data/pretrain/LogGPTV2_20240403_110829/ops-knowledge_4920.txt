User: I just downloaded GNU emacs23.4, and I already have python3.2 installed in Windows7.
I have been using Python IDLE to edit python files.
The problem is that I can edit python files with Emacs but I do not know how to run python interpreter in Emacs. When i click on "switch to interpreter", then it says "Searching for program: no such file or directory, python"
Someone says i need to make some change on .emacs file, but i do not know where to look for.
And I am very unexperienced and just started to learn programming. I am not familiar with commonly used terminologies. I have been searching for solutions but most of the articles i find on the Internet only confuse me.
so the questions are:

how do i run python interpreter in Emacs?
are there different kind of python interpreter? if so, why do they have different interpreters for one language?
Assistant: C-c C-z can do this. It is the key-binding for the command python-switch-to-python
