Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an issue I encountered in the "Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element" challenge.

The challenge requires the following for the `green-box` class:
- 40px margin on the left
- 20px margin on the bottom
- 20px margin on the top
- 20px margin on the right

However, when I set the top margin to 20px, as specified, it was not accepted. The system only accepted the value when I set the top margin to 40px.

Could you please verify and address this discrepancy? 

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
