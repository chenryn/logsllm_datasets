Hey folks,
In the Waypoint: Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element
challenge, it is asked to fulfill the following:
Your green-box class should give the left of elements 40px of margin.  
Your green-box class should give the bottom of elements 20px of margin.  
Your green-box class should give the top of elements 20px of margin.  
Your green-box class should give the right of elements 20px of margin.
However, the third one (top of elements), only was checked as "accepted" when
I entered the value of 40px instead of 20px. Could you please verify?
