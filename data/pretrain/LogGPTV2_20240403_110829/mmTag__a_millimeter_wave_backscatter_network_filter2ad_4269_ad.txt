# mmTag: A Millimeter Wave Backscatter Network

## 9.3 System Performance of mmTag
We have evaluated the performance of mmTag at various distances while it is facing the Access Point (AP). In the next section, we will assess mmTag's performance considering both distance and orientation.

### Figure 14: mmTag System Performance
Figure 14 illustrates the received power from the node for different distances and angles. The figure indicates that mmTag can achieve Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) greater than 7 dB in all scenarios. Additionally, the corresponding Bit Error Rate (BER) for each SNR is provided. These results suggest that nodes can successfully communicate with the AP, regardless of their location, angle, or orientation relative to the AP. Therefore, we conclude that mmTag supports mobile applications.

## 9.4 Power Consumption of mmTag
A key advantage of mmTag is its ability to enable low-power millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication for devices with limited energy resources. Here, we evaluate the power consumption of the mmTag node. The design of the mmTag node primarily uses passive traces and transmission lines, with only six Single-Pole Double-Throw (SPDT) switches as active components. Our measurements show that the mmTag node consumes 2.4 nJ/bit. It is important to note that the mmTag node does not require a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), mixer, or baseband hardware. Instead, it receives a bit stream by directly connecting to a General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) port of a microcontroller or Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which are already available in user devices such as cameras, Augmented Reality (AR) headsets, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

## 10. Discussion
In this section, we compare mmTag with existing wireless systems, including WiFi, Bluetooth, WiFi backscatter, and other mmWave platforms. Specifically, we compare these systems in terms of power consumption, throughput, and range. Table 1 summarizes the results of this comparison.

### Comparison with Existing Systems
- **Past mmWave Platforms**: Systems like MiRa cost several thousand dollars and consume more than 10 nJ/bit. In contrast, mmTag is low-cost and consumes only 2.4 nJ/bit. While past mmWave platforms offer multi-Gbps throughput and long-range communication, making them suitable for applications with substantial energy resources, mmTag targets applications with limited energy sources.
- **WiFi**: The primary advantage of mmTag over WiFi is its significantly lower power consumption. Additionally, mmTag utilizes the mmWave spectrum (24 GHz), thereby reducing the strain on the current WiFi spectrum. Note that the reported WiFi bit-rate performance is for an ideal scenario; in reality, most WiFi networks perform much lower due to spectrum overload.
- **Bluetooth and WiFi Backscatter**: mmTag provides a much higher data rate while maintaining similar power consumption. Bluetooth and WiFi backscatter offer only 1 Mbps and 300 Kbps, respectively, which are insufficient for many applications. In contrast, mmTag offers 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps at 4.6 m and 8 m, respectively, making it suitable for low-power applications requiring high-data-rate links.

## 11. Conclusion
In this paper, we present mmTag, a mmWave backscatter communication system that achieves data rates comparable to other mmWave networks while maintaining power consumption levels similar to backscatter networks. Current backscatter networks, such as RFID and WiFi backscatter, enable low-power wireless communication, which is attractive for devices with limited energy resources. However, they provide very limited data rates, which are not suitable for many emerging applications. On the other hand, existing mmWave networks offer high-data-rate links but have high power consumption. We developed and evaluated a backscatter network that operates in the mmWave spectrum, combining the low power consumption of backscatter networks with the large bandwidth available at mmWave frequencies. Our results show that mmTag provides Gbps communication links with nodes that consume only 2.4 nJ/bit. We believe mmTag enables wireless links for many emerging applications that deliver content in real-time while having limited energy resources.
