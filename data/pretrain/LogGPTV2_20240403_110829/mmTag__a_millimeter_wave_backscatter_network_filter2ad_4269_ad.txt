9.3 mmTag’s System Performance
So far, we have evaluated the performance of mmTag for different
distances while it has been facing the AP. Next, we evaluate mm-
Tag’s performance for different distances and orientations together.
Figure 14 shows the received power from the node for different
distances and angles. The figure shows that mmTag can achieve
SNRs higher than 7 dB for all scenarios. The figure also shows the
corresponding bit error rate (BER) for each SNR. This result implies
nodes can communicate to the AP successfully, regardless of their
location, angle or orientation with respect to the AP. Therefore, we
conclude that mmTag supports mobile applications.
9.4 mmTag’s Power Consumption
A key promise of mmTag is that it enables low-power mmWave
communication for devices with limited energy resources. Here,
we evaluate the power consumption of mmTag’s node. The design
of mmTag’s node is mostly using passive traces and transmission
lines, namely the only components used in the design are six SPDT
switches. Our measurement shows that the mmTag’s node con-
sumes 2.4nJ/bit. It is worth mentioning that mmTag’s node design
does not need a DAC, mixer or baseband hardware, and it receives

for different scenarios (i.e. different range, orientation and
angle of the node respect to the AP.)
a bit stream by directly connecting it to a (GPIO) port of a micro-
controller or an FPGA which is already available in the user device
such as a camera, an Augmented Reality (AR) headset, or an IoT
device.

SIGCOMM ’21, August 23–27, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
10 DISCUSSION
In this section, we compare mmTag with existing wireless systems
such as WiFi, Bluetooth, WiFi backscatter and other mmWave plat-
forms. Specifically, we compare these systems in terms of power
consumption, throughput, and range. Table 1 shows the results of
this comparison.
Past mmWave platforms such as MiRa cost a few thousand dol-
lars and consume more than 10nJ/bit. On the other hand, mmTag
is low cost and consumes only 2.4nJ/bit. It is worth mentioning
that past mmWave platforms provide multi-Gbps throughput and
long range communication links which make them suitable for ap-
plications with substantial energy resources available. In contrast,
mmTag targets applications with limited energy sources.
In comparison to WiFi, the main advantage of mmTag is that it
consumes orders of magnitude lower power. Furthermore, mmTag
utilizes mmWave spectrum (24 GHz) and hence it will remove
a huge strain from today’s WiFi spectrum. Finally, note that the
reported WiFi bit-rate performance is for an ideal scenario. In fact,
most of today’s WiFi networks have much lower performance since
their spectrum is overloaded.
In comparison with Bluetooth and WiFi backscatter, mmTag
provides a much higher data-rate while having similar power con-
sumption. Specifically, Bluetooth and WiFi backscatter provide only
1 Mbps and 300 Kbps, respectively, which are not sufficient for many
applications. On the other hand, mmTag provides 1 Gbps and 100
Mbps at 4.6m and 8m respectively, making it suitable for many
low-power applications which require high-data-rate links.
11 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present mmTag, a mmWave backscatter communi-
cation system which enables a data-rate similar to other mmWave
networks with power consumption similar to backscatter networks.
Today’s backscatter networks (such as RFID and WiFi baskscatter)
enable low-power wireless communication which is very attractive
for devices with limited energy resources. However, backscatter
networks provide very limited data-rates which are not suitable for
many emerging applications. On the other hand, existing mmWave
network enable very high-data-rate links but have high power con-
sumption. In this paper, we developed and evaluated a backscatter
network which operates in the mmWave spectrum. Hence, it ben-
efits from both low power consumption of backscatter networks
and large bandwidth available at mmWave frequencies. Our results
show that mmTag provides Gbps communication links with nodes
that consume only 2.4nJ/bit. We believe mmTag enables wireless
links for many emerging applications which deliver content in
real-time while having limited energy resources available.
