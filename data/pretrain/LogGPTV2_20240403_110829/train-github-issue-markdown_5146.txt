The information in `doc/source/user/c-info.how-to-extend.rst` is repeated in
`doc/source/reference/c-api.array.rst. The first should only reference the
second, and the descriptive text should be merged.
This may be a good starter task. The cycle to fix this issue, based on the doc
building documentation is to
  1. create the documentation with `make html`
  2. Note the many warnings about `duplicate C object description` in the two files
  3. Edit the files to unify the documentation, one should be using `.. c:function::` to define the functions and the other using `:c:func:` to reference it, perhaps with descriptive text.
  4. Use `firefox build/html/reference/c-api.array.html` and `firefox build/html/user/c-info.how-to-extend.html` to view the changes
