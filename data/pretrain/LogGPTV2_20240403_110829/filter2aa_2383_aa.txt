**Introduction**

Hello and welcome. My name is Tom Ritter, and I work for iSEC Partners. If you are not familiar with Zax, you will be by the end of this presentation.

**Anonymity in the Early Days of Cypherpunks**

This talk is about an anonymity network that emerged during the early days of the Cypherpunk movement in the 1990s. At that time, the book "PGP: Pretty Good Privacy" had just been published, but the U.S. government had ruled that while the book itself could be exported, the floppy disk containing the source code could not. The U.S. government was actively investigating Phil Zimmermann for violating the Arms Control Export Act by making the first few versions of PGP available. Meanwhile, Dan Bernstein and the newly formed Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) took the U.S. government to court, challenging the export controls on cryptography. Another group of individuals printed the source code for PGP, exported it to Europe, scanned it, and OCR-ed it, releasing a version of PGP that bypassed these export controls.

**Alt.Anonymous.Messages and Metadata**

Alt.Anonymous.Messages was created during the height of the cypherpunk era and has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. In recent years, there has been a significant focus by national spy agencies on metadata rather than the content of encrypted messages. As the saying goes, "The people who know won't talk, and the people who talk don't know." However, leaked court orders have revealed that Verizon was required to turn over call records, both local and international. While I am only speculating, the most straightforward use of this data is to build communication graphs, analyze metadata for patterns, identify people of interest, and determine their contacts.

**SSL and Metadata Leaks**

SSL, the most widely used encrypted channel on the internet, can reveal a wealth of information even if the encryption itself is secure. SSL sessions disclose details such as the type and version of the client, the local time, and whether packets are being sent and received. Additionally, SSL does not hide the identity of the party you are communicating with, making it clear when you are on platforms like Facebook. The adversary can also see the exact times and amounts of data being exchanged, down to the microsecond, without any real padding to obscure this information.

**Tor and Its Limitations**

Tor is an implementation of Onion Routing, where messages are passed along a chain, with each node peeling off a layer of encryption until the exit node communicates with the intended destination. This design aims to disguise who is talking to whom, but it does not prevent adversaries from knowing that communication is occurring, when it is happening, and how much data is being exchanged. Tor does not implement significant padding, and it explicitly omits link padding. If an adversary can observe the entire path of the circuit, such as through a coordinated effort by multiple countries, they can track your traffic and identify your contacts. Even if the adversary can only see the start and end nodes, they can still perform attacks to de-anonymize users, as demonstrated in the case of Jeremy Hammond.

**Mix Networks and Shared Mailboxes**

Mix Networks introduce delays and collect messages into pools before sending them out, which helps to obscure the origin and destination of messages. This adds a layer of uncertainty and is a crucial component of anonymous communication. Shared Mailboxes, such as Alt.Anonymous.Messages, allow multiple users to access an inbox with read-only access. All messages are encrypted, and users can download all messages and decrypt those intended for them. While an observer can see that a user is accessing the mailbox, they cannot determine which messages, if any, the user can decrypt. This provides strong security at the cost of increased bandwidth.

**Nymservs and Interaction with the World**

For shared mailboxes to be practical, they need to interact with the broader email system. Nymservs facilitate this by receiving messages at a domain name and posting them to alt.anonymous.messages. More complex nymservs can forward mail to another email address or route it through a remailer network. When sending a message to a nym that uses a shared mailbox, the sender ideally uses an Onion Router or a Mix Network, providing additional security properties.

**Current State of AAM**

Alt.Anonymous.Messages (AAM) should theoretically offer strong security, but its current state reveals some shortcomings. Over half of the messages in the dataset go through nodes operated by just two people, creating a lack of network diversity and potential vulnerability. Despite a decrease in the average number of messages over the last decade, the volume has stabilized in recent years. Analysis of the data shows that the majority of messages are PGP-encrypted, with a small number of non-PGP messages, including random rants and a set of approximately 10,000 messages with the subject "SATANIC OPERATION," which appear to be alphabetic ciphertext with a perfectly even distribution.

Thank you for your attention.
