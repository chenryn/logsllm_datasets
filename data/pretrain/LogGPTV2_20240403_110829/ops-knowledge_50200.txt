User: Can I execute a shell command that requires input in ipython and/or an ipython notebook? 
When I execute such a command, I see it's prompt, but no apparent way to provide it with input from my keyboard.
An example could be an rsync command to a remote server (thus requiring a password). There are no doubt dangers security-wise here - these are somewhat reduced in my case as I'm running on localhost.
Assistant: Was just looking for this and my wee face dropped when I saw it was a bit of an issue. Thought I would just post my solution in case it is usefull to anyone else.
Basically I was looking for a way to send sudo commands through the notebook, probably not very wise but I needed it for what I was doing. And i couldn't get a prompt for the password. So decided to use a x-terminal and sending the command through to the terminal. You don't get any feed back but may be due to not hooking to the IO on the way back.  Here is what i used in the notebook:
In [1]    !xterm -e sudo mount -o loop system.img /system/
I'm using linux but i would expect !cmd for windows might do the trick too
