## 1. Introduction to Computer-Implemented Inventions (CIIs)

A computer-implemented invention (CII) is a method or system that involves the use of a computer, software, or data processing. For example, a simple CII might be a computer program that takes inputs, computes a maximum value, and returns the result.

### Example:
```python
def FindArrayMax(t, minI, maxI):
    for i in range(minI, maxI):
        # Compute maximum
    return result
```

For an invention to be patentable, it must have technical character. This means that the subject matter must provide a technical solution to a technical problem.

## 2. Examples of CIIs

### Example I: Exclusion
**Method of Controlling Payment and Delivery of Content:**
- A provider receives a request for content from a user.
- The provider accesses content information describing the requested content.
- The provider accesses regulation information related to the payment, content, and geographical information of the user.
- The geographic location of the user is determined.
- The provider determines if the requested content satisfies the regulations.
- If so, the content is delivered for free; otherwise, a payment request is transmitted to the user.

**Clearly Technical Aspects:**
- None

### Example II: Computer-Implemented Business Method
**Method of Controlling Payment and Delivery of Content within a Computer System:**
- The provider server receives a request for content from the user terminal.
- The provider server accesses content and regulation information in the database.
- The geographic location of the user is determined.
- The provider server determines if the requested content satisfies the regulations.
- If so, the content is delivered; otherwise, a payment request is transmitted.

**Technical Aspects:**
- Server receiving data over a communication network.
- Server accessing and processing data.
- Server transmitting the result to the terminal.

**Non-Technical Aspects:**
- Same business process as in Example I.

**Inventive Step:**
- **Technical Character:** Yes
- **Non-Technical Aspects:** Yes
- **Requirements:** Business method (ordering content and calculating its price)
- **Closest Prior Art:** Computer system with a server, database, and terminal connected via a communication network.
- **Differences:** Implementation of the business method.
- **Skilled Person:** Data processing expert.
- **Objective Technical Problem:** Automate the business method on the computer system.
- **Solution:** Implementation/automation is considered obvious.

### Example III: Computer-Implemented Business Method with Geographic Location Determination
**Method of Controlling Payment and Delivery of Content:**
- Similar to Example II, but with the addition of determining the geographic location of the user using specific method steps (x, y, z).

**Inventive Step:**
- **Technical Character:** Yes
- **Non-Technical Aspects:** Yes
- **Requirements:** Business method (ordering content and calculating its price)
- **Closest Prior Art:** Computer system with a server, database, and terminal capable of determining the user's location.
- **Non-Technical Differences:** Business method.
- **Technical Differences:** Method steps x, y, z.
- **Skilled Person:** Data processing expert.
- **Objective Technical Problem:**
  - Automate the business method.
  - Find an alternative method for determining the geographic location.
- **Solution:**
  - Automation is obvious.
  - Alternative method for determining location: Obvious?

### Example IV: Computer-Implemented Method of Controlling a Physical Process
**Method of Controlling a Physical Process:**
- Analyzing a functional relationship between two parameters.
- Extending the range of one parameter based on generated data for process control.

**Technical Aspects:**
- Controlling a physical process.
- Extending the range of a parameter for process control.

**Non-Technical Aspects:**
- Analyzing a functional relationship between parameters.

**Contributes to Technical Character:**
- Yes

## 3. EPO Practice: Inventive Step

### Problem-Solution Approach:
1. **Establish Closest Prior Art:** Always chosen from a field of technology.
2. **Determine Differentiating Features and Their Technical Effects.**
3. **Formulate the Objective Technical Problem:** Derived from the technical differences between the closest prior art and the claimed subject-matter.
4. **Decide Whether the Proposed Solution is Obvious:** Skilled person in the relevant field of technology.

### Case Law:
- **Comvik (T0641/00):**
  - An invention with a mixture of technical and non-technical features and having technical character as a whole is assessed for inventive step by considering all features contributing to the technical character.
  - Non-technical aims may appear in the formulation of the problem as constraints.

- **RICOH (T172/03):**
  - Prior art not related to a technological field does not belong to the state of the art for Articles 54 and 56 EPC.
  - Providing an implementation of a business-related method on a computer system is a technical problem.
  - Mere automation of business-related aspects using conventional hardware and programming methods is obvious.

- **HITACHI (T0258/03):**
  - Prior art should not be considered when deciding on Article 52(2)(3) questions.
  - Mixes of technical and non-technical features are generally accepted as inventions under Article 52(1) EPC.

- **MICROSOFT (T0424/03):**
  - A computer-implemented method is distinguished from a computer program.
  - A computer-readable medium is a technical product and has technical character.

- **Pension Benefit (T0391/95):**
  - An apparatus suitable for performing or supporting an economic activity is an invention under Article 52(1) EPC.
  - There is no basis for distinguishing between new and known features when examining patentability.

## 4. Conclusions
- **Computer-Implemented Inventions (CIIs) are not excluded from patentability.**
- **Patentability exclusions should be interpreted narrowly.**
- **Only one technical feature needs to be present for the whole subject-matter to be considered technical.**
- **Inventive step assessment is crucial for CIIs, and only technical features can form the basis for inventive step.**
