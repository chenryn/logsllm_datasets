assessment of novelty and inventive step
18
EPO Practice: Inventive step
Problem solution approach
Establish closest prior art (always chosen from a field of
technology).
Determine differentiating features and their technical effects.
Formulate the objective technical problem (derived by the
technical differences between the closest prior art and the claimed
subject-matter, it must be a technical problem, however a non-
technical aim may appear as a constraint that has to be met).
Decide whether the proposed solution is obvious for the skilled
person (skilled in a field of technology, in this case information
technology, no knowledge of non-technical fields, e.g. finance).
19
Example II: Inventive Step
Technical character: yes
Non-technical aspects: yes
Requirements = business method:
specification: "ordering content and calculating its price"
Closest prior art: computer system comprising a server,
database, and a terminal which are
connected via a communication network
Differences: said business method
Skilled person: data processing expert
Objective technical automate said business method on said
problem: computer system
Solution: implementation/ automation is considered
obvious

Example III: Computer-implemented business method
• A computer-implemented method of controlling payment and delivery of
content within a computer system comprising a user terminal, a provider
server and a database which are connected via a communication
network, the method comprising:
– the provider server receiving a request for content from the user
terminal;
– the provider server accessing in the database content information
describing the requested content;
– the provider server accessing regulation information in the database
describing at least one regulation that is related to the payment and the
content information of the requested content and to geographical
information of the user;
– determining the geographic location of the user;
– the provider server determining whether the requested content
satisfies the at least one regulation;
• if so, delivering the requested content to the user terminal
• if not, transmitting a payment request to the user terminal.
 wherein the geographic location of the user is determined by the IP
address of the user terminal using method steps x, y, z.
21
Example III: Inventive Step
Technical character: yes
Non-technical aspects: yes
Requirements = business method:
specification: ordering content and calculating its price
Closest prior art: computer system comprising a server,
database, and a terminal which are connected
via a communications network capable of
determining the location of user.
Non-technical differences: said business method
Technical differences: method steps x, y, z
Skilled person: data processing expert
Objective technical 1. automate said business method
problem: 2. find alternative method for determining
geographic location of use
Solution: 1. automation is obvious
2. obvious?

analysing a functional relationship between two parameters, the method
comprising

• the range of one of said parameters is extended in accordance with data
generated for use in the control of said physical process.

Technical character
No technical character
Those parts of the features making no technical contribution
cannot indicate the presence of an inventive step
A non-obvious technical contribution over the prior art
in the technical field is necessary
24
Case law: Comvik: T0641/00 (26/09/2002)
Headnote 1:
An invention consisting of a mixture of technical and non technical
features and having technical character as a whole is to be assessed
with respect to the requirement of inventive step by taking account of
all those features which contribute to said technical character
whereas features making no such contribution cannot support the
presence of inventive step.
Headnote 2:
Although the technical problem to be solved should not be formulated
to contain pointers to the solution or partially anticipate it, merely
because some feature appears in the claim does not automatically
exclude it from appearing in the formulation of the problem. In
particular where the claim refers to an aim to be achieved in a
non-technical field, this aim may legitimately appear in the
formulation of the problem as part of the framework of the technical
problem that is to be solved, in particular as a constraint that has to
be met.
25
Case law: RICOH: T172/03 (27/11/2003)
• Any prior art which is not related to any technological field or field from
which a skilled person would expect to derive any technically relevant
information does not belong to the state of the art to be considered in
the context of Articles 54 and 56 EPC.
• Skilled person within the meaning of Article 56 EPC is a technical
expert, professional or practicioner.
• "State of the art" should be understood as "state of technology" which
does not include the state of the art in commerce and business
methods
26
Case law: RICOH: T172/03 (27/11/2003)
• Providing an implementation of a business-related method on
a computer system is a technical problem.
• Legitimate to include the non-technical aspects and features
into the formulation of the technical problem.
• Technical features of the implementation (functions of the
distributed system) follow directly from the requirements
specification.
• Mere automation of constraints imposed by the business-
related aspects using conventional hardware and programming
methods must be considered as obvious.
27
Case law: HITACHI T0258/03 (21/04/2004)
Confirmation that prior art should not be considered
when deciding on Article 52 (2)(3) questions.
"Practical" reasons for generally accepting mixes of
technical and non-technical features as inventions in the
meaning of Article 52(1) EPC, since separation may be
difficult.
Examples for non-inventions: purely abstract concepts
devoid of any technical implications.
28
Case law: MICROSOFT: T 0424/03 (23/02/06)
A method implemented in a computer system
represents a sequence of steps actually performed
and achieving an effect, and not a sequence of
computer-executable instructions (i.e. computer
program) which just have the potential of achieving such
an effect when loaded into, and run on, a computer.
Therefore: the claim category of a computer-
implemented method is distinguished from that of a
computer program.
29
Case law: MICROSOFT: T 0424/03 (23/02/06)
Computer-readable medium: Claim 5
The subject-matter of claim 5 has technical character
since it relates to a computer-readable medium, i.e. a
technical product involving a carrier (T258/03 HITACHI).
The computer-executable instructions have the potential
of achieving a further technical effect, i.e. enhancing the
internal operation of the computer by facilitating the
exchange of data among various application programs.
This further technical effect goes beyond the elementary
interaction of any software and hardware data
processing (T1173/97 IBM) and thus the computer
program recorded on the medium is not considered to
be a computer program as such (5.3).
30
Case law: MICROSOFT: T 0424/03 (23/02/06)
Conclusions:
1. The claim category of a computer-implemented
method is distinguished from that of a computer
program. Even though a method, in particular a
method of operating a computer, may be put into
practice with the help of a computer program, a
claim relating to such a method does not claim a
computer program in the category of a computer
program.
2. A computer-readable medium is a technical product
and, thus, has a technical character.
31
Case Law: Pension Benefit: T0391/95 (8/9/2000)
• An apparatus constituting a physical entity or concrete product,
suitable for performing or supporting an economic activity, is an
invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC.
• There is no basis in the EPC for distinguishing between "new
features" of an invention and features of that invention which
are known from the prior art when examining whether the
invention concerned may be considered to be an invention
within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC. Thus there is no basis
in the EPC for applying the so-called contribution approach.
32
Conclusions
 Computer-implemented inventions are not excluded from
patentability.
 Patentability exclusions to be interpreted in a narrow way - only
one technical feature needs to be present for the whole subject-
matter to be technical.
 Inventive step assessment has become most important when
dealing with computer-implemented inventions (however only
technical features can be the basis for inventive step).
