User: I have a Python script script.py which I am using to generate the command line argument to another script exactly like so:
./main $(./script.py)
The output of script.py may contain spaces (e.g. foo bar) which are being unintentionally interpreted by the shell. I want the argument to ./main to be the single string "foo bar". Of course I can solve this problem if I quote the argument to ./main, like this:
./main "$(./script.py)"
But I can't and don't want to do that. (The reason is because ./main is being called without quotes from another script which I don't have control to edit.)
Is there an alternative representation of the space character that my Python script can use, and that bash won't interpret?
Assistant: Assuming that:

you have control over ./main and that it is a shell script
the entire output from the Python script is to be interpreted as a single parameter

simply use $* rather than $1 inside ./main
