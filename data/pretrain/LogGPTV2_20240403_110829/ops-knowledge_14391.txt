Question: "Alice is trying to verify the integrity of a file she downloaded. She has the file's SHA256 hash that was securely obtained from the file's creators. What properties of the cryptographic hash function ensure that if the computed hash of her downloaded file matches the provided hash, the file is likely authentic and unaltered? Select all that apply."
 "A": "The hash function is one-way, ensuring that an adversary cannot generate the original file from the hash alone."
 "B": "The hash function is second preimage resistant, preventing an adversary from finding a different file with the same hash as the original."
 "C": "The hash function is collision resistant, making it infeasible to find two distinct files that produce the same hash."
 "D": "The hash function is computation resistant, requiring significant time to calculate the hash for any given file."
Answer: ABC
