### What problem does this feature solve?
I'm using a global error handler for process errors during component render
function and watchers.
But it does not catch the exception thrown in the list method below:
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          key: null,
        };
      },
      watch: {
        async key() {
          await this.list();
        },
      },
      methods: {
        async list() {
          return axios.get('An invalid url');
        },
      },
    };
### What does the proposed API look like?
No need to change API
