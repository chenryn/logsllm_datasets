User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Ora - 00472 - PMON process terminated with error (ORACLE) i am technical support in our company, We have encountered this error "Ora-00472" , Also it shows from the SVRMGR23 in ORACLE when connecting to the database, it shows "connected to an idle instance". How can i fix this error?

Thank you,

Assistant: It depends. What do the alert logs say? You probably have something else going on because pmon failures are symptoms of deeper issues for the most part.
