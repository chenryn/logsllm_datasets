User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why can't I remotely connect to MySQL running on my Azure VPS? I've installed MySQL 5.5 on a Microsoft Azure VPS (2012 Server).  I created a user account, told it to allow any host and created an EndPoint on port 3306.  I can remote into the VPS using RDP and connect locally just fine.

I also allowed the MySQL installer to create the needed firewall rules in Windows and it appears to be valid (allowing incoming TCP to port 3306).

What am I missing?

The error is "Can't connect to MySQL Server  (4) 2003"

And, I can't seem to find the MySQL log files. 

Also, this is a dump of my mysql.user table:

Host        User    Password
-------------------------------------------------------------
localhost   root    *0735EF2BBDF0D50FB780E9B58198D7260991E311
127.0.0.1   root    *0735EF2BBDF0D50FB780E9B58198D7260991E311
::1         root    *0735EF2BBDF0D50FB780E9B58198D7260991E311
%           cbmeeks *3CA067E806B5BB2DF87A89D517BBAF80DD22C27A


Neither cbmeeks or root work remotely.

Assistant: I hate answering my own question but the solution was right in front of me.  I made every logical attempt and finally discovered that it was indeed the Windows Firewall.

I KNEW that obviously blocking the port would prevent it from connecting remotely.

So that was the first place I looked.  What I didn't catch, however, is that the inbound rule was set to "Domain".  I set it to "Public" and it worked.  

Not an expert on Windows Firewall rules but hopefully this will help someone.  

Since I will be having an Azure VPS connect to another Azure VPS, it's probably worth mentioning that the firewall rule should be tweaked to only allow connections from the allowed VPS's.  But that's a different topic.   Hopefully this will help someone else out.

Thanks to @Suku for pointing me to the help page.
