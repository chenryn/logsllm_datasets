  * Electron version: 1.2.0
  * Operating system: Mac OS
With electron 1.0.1, I'm able to use the following code:
        // requests to 'itch-internal' are used to communicate between web content & the app
        let internalFilter = {
          urls: ['https://itch-internal/*']
        }
        session.webRequest.onBeforeRequest(internalFilter, (details, callback) => {
          callback({cancel: true})
        })
but on 1.2.0, the callback is never called. Did the filter syntax change? Or
did the functionality broke with a Chrome update?
