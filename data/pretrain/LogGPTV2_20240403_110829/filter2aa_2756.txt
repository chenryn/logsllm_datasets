The Problem:  802.11b Geo-Location
• 
Researchers have documented at least 4 Techniques for 
Geo-Location of Wireless Access Points (APs)1
• 
Netstumbler doesn’t Geo-Locate –> It simply gives the 
Driver’s GPS Position.
• 
Netstumbling & GeoCaching Compared:
Wardrivers don’t locate AP’s with the same intent that 
GeoCachers find Caches;  they’re content to simply find 
New Networks. GeoCaching, in contrast, is all about 
Precise Location…
• 
What if we could combine the two?
Consider a New Sport:  “Wireless GeoCaching”

What’s GeoCaching?
• 
Wikipedia:
- 
GeoCaching is an outdoor treasure-hunting 
game in which the participants use a Global 
Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other 
navigational techniques to hide and seek 
containers (called “GeoCaches" or "caches"). 
- 
Typical Cache - a small waterproof container 
containing a logbook & "treasure," usually 
toys or trinkets of little monetary value.

• 
Location:  Lake Anna, VA
•

Agenda
• 
Background – Why is Wireless Tracking so 
Hard???
• 
4 Techniques – Advantages / Disadvantages
• 
Building the Tracker  (HW/ SW)
• 
Static Test with a Known AP
• 
Wireless GeoCaching

Why So Difficult?
• 
Spread Spectrum Technology - DSSS hops 
many x/sec. and covers a 22 Mhz Bandwidth
• 
Spread Spectrum designed by the Military to 
look like Background Noise (Very Low Power)
• 
Must wait on Beacon Frames &  Probe Frames
• 
2.4 Ghz Radio Propagation Subject to:
- 
Multipath Inteference
- 
Scattering Interference, (Trees & Buildings)

4 DF Techniques
• 
Radio Direction Finding (RDF)
• 
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) + 
Angle of Arrival (AOA) + Triangulation
• 
Doppler Direction Finding
• 
Time of Arrival (TOA) & Time Difference of 
Arrival (TDOA)
7/6/2007

Radio Direction Finding (RDF)
• 
Very Simple – Point a directional antenna in 
the proper direction & Maximize Signal
• 
Advantages:
- 
Low Cost
- 
Can be done Manually (aim the Cantenna.)  Duh!
• 
Disadvantages:
- 
Accuracy limited to Antenna Beamwidth & Rotor 
System Mechanics
- 
Can’t Geo-Locate –> Simply guides you in the 
Right Direction (Sort of)

RSSI + AOA + Triangulation
• 
A step up from simple RDF:  Given >= 2 
locations (fixes), target position follows by 
Triangulation: 
Law of Sines
• AP Target located @ A.  
• Boat takes 2 Fixes, giving angles B & C.  
• Side a = GPS distance B -> C. 
• Distance to Target follows from the Law of Sines.

Doppler Direction Finding (DDF)
• 
DDF systems employ 4 + Antennas & use the 
Doppler effect to derive AOA & Distance
Advantages:
Better for moving Targets
More accurate Speed Calculation
Disadvantage:
Equipment is very expensive: 
Professional 2.4 Ghz RDF rig 
costs approx. $3,000

Time of Arrival (TOA) & Time Difference 
of Arrival (TDOA)
• 
Similar to Doppler:  Electronically calculated from 
Multiple Antennas
• 
Examples:  
- 
Cellular Tower Signal Location
- 
People Tracking via RFID & WiFi (AeroScout.com)
- 
CISCO 2710 Wireless Location Appliance
• 
Advantage:
- 
Excellent with known Cell Towers or AP’s
• 
Disadvantages:
- 
May not be as Accurate
- 
Requires Existing Infrastructure

Building the Wireless Tracker cont’d
• 
First: The stepper motor must be mounted on a stable, 
flat surface.  For our project this is a 7” x 7” square 
LEXAN sheet. LEXAN sheet is held 2.5” above the 
Boat table by 4 Hex Bolts
• 
Drill 4 holes for motor mount & 4 holes for the 
LEXAN stepper motor “tabletop”

strip to Stepping Motor shaft.  Note Brass 
coupler w/ 2 set screws that mount directly to 
the motor

• 
Third: Hook up the parallel printer (control) cable 
to the Laptop.  Carefully wire the Stepper motor to 
the Control Board as shown below. Use Outputs 1-4 
for the 4 phases… Note there are a total of 6 wires 
on this UniPolar Motor (5 & 6 go to Ground)

Fourth:  Test the stepping Motor & verify proper 
operation with the included Program 
StepperV6.EXE. Note:  Our motor steps @ 7.5 
degrees/ step.  So, 48 steps = 1 Revolution = 1 
Compass Rose.  Screen Shot:

• 
Final Step:  Mount the Compass & (optional) Laser 
Pointer just above and pointing in exactly the same 
direction as the YAGI antenna. Connect between 
Output 12 and GND of the Control Board.
• 
The Laser pointer can be used at night to Illuminate 
Target AP & Direction once Max Signal Strength

So, Why a Stepper Motor?
• 
Stepper Motors achieve very Precise Control 
of Angular Rotation
• 
No Feedback Loop Required
• 
Repeatable Control allows them to be used in 
floppy Disk Drives & Flatbed Scanners
• 
Can be salvaged from old Floppy drives & used in 
projects like this:

Stepper Motor Operation
• 
Stepper Motors Rotate by Energizing Phases 1-4 in 
sequence.  Source:  Wikipedia
Mag
1- Magnet (1) is charged, 
attracting the topmost four 
teeth of sprocket.
2- Magnet (1) turned off, 
Magnet (2) charged, pulling 
four teeth to the right. This 
results in a rotation of 3.6°
3- Magnet (2) off, (3) 
on, another 3.6 deg. 
rotation; Repeat for 
Phases 3-4…

And the Antenna Selection?
• 
YAGI Antenna - Very Directional with High Front 
to Back ratio.  Practically, this means no 180 deg. 
mistakes in Direction Finding (DF)
• 
Perfect Pattern for DF and weighs only 2.9 oz

Building the Tracker - Software
• 
PCMCIA Card – Senao 2511 with Prism Chipset
• 
Front-End Monitoring via Netstumbler 0.4.0
• 
Netstumbler Script:  Given an AP SSID as the 
Target, Script captures the Signal Strength readings 
on Fast Scan & writes them to a file

25
Building the Tracker - Software
• 
Visual Basic:  Back-end VB program controls both 
Stepper Motor rotation & getting Signal Strength 
from the NS Script file.  (VB Code included as a 
separate file.)
FOR Step = 1 to 100 
‘ 360 Degree Scan
If rev1.Value = False Then               ‘REVERSE OR FORWARD
Call stepper_move(1, Val(steps1.Text))   ‘FORWARD
Else
Call stepper_move(1, -Val(steps1.Text))   ‘REVERSE
End If

Safety Warning
• 
WARNING:  The as-built version of the Scanner 
utilizing a Senao 200 mw high-power card produces 
an EIRP of 4 watts (the maximum legal limit)
• 
While within FCC limits, radiation exposure limits 
state you should stay at least 36 inches away from 
ANY Beam antenna and operate the scanner such 
that it does not point at any vehicle occupants.  (see 
ARRL on the web for more info.)
• 
Never operate a Laser such that it points directly at 
another person, (eyes).
