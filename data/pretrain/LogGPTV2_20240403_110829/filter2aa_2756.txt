## Slide 1: Introduction
**Title:** GeoLocation of Wireless Access Points & "Wireless GeoCaching"  
**Date:** 7/6/2007  
**Event:** DEFCON 15  
**Presenter:** Rick Hill

## Slide 2: The Problem: 802.11b Geo-Location
### Key Points:
- Researchers have documented at least four techniques for geolocating wireless access points (APs).
- Netstumbler does not perform geolocation; it only provides the driver's GPS position.
- Comparison between Netstumbling and GeoCaching:
  - Wardrivers aim to find new networks without precise location.
  - GeoCachers focus on finding caches with exact coordinates.
- Proposal: Combine these activities into a new sport, "Wireless GeoCaching."

---

## Slide 3: What is GeoCaching?
### Definition:
- **GeoCaching** is an outdoor treasure-hunting game where participants use GPS receivers or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called "GeoCaches" or "caches").
- A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and "treasure," usually toys or trinkets of little monetary value.

---

## Slide 4: Project Goals
### Objectives:
- Build an automated 802.11b tracking device using off-the-shelf (OTS) components.
- Test the device in a controlled environment (Lake Anna, VA).
- Participate in a "Wireless GeoCaching" game by geolocating hidden APs and caches using Netstumbler and Radio Direction Finding (RDF) techniques.

---

## Slide 5: Project Concept
### Methodology:
- **Direction Finding (DF) Techniques:**
  - Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) + Angle of Arrival (AOA) + Triangulation is the easiest to implement.
- **Platform:**
  - Sea Ray Boat
- **Location:**
  - Lake Anna, VA
- **Equipment:**
  - Hardware: 15 dB YAGI Antenna, Stepping Motor & Controller, Digital Compass, GPS, Dell Laptop
  - Software: Windows XP, Netstumbler 0.4.0, Visual Basic 5.0

---

## Slide 6: Agenda
### Outline:
- Background: Why is wireless tracking so difficult?
- Four DF techniques: Advantages and disadvantages
- Building the tracker (hardware and software)
- Static test with a known AP
- Wireless GeoCaching
- Accuracy comparison with other techniques

---

## Slide 7: Why is Wireless Tracking Difficult?
### Challenges:
- **Spread Spectrum Technology:**
  - DSSS hops many times per second and covers a 22 MHz bandwidth.
  - Designed by the military to look like background noise (very low power).
- **Signal Detection:**
  - Must wait for Beacon Frames and Probe Frames.
- **Radio Propagation:**
  - Subject to multipath interference and scattering (from trees and buildings).

---

## Slide 8: Four DF Techniques
### Techniques:
- **Radio Direction Finding (RDF)**
- **Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) + Angle of Arrival (AOA) + Triangulation**
- **Doppler Direction Finding (DDF)**
- **Time of Arrival (TOA) & Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)**

---

## Slide 9: Radio Direction Finding (RDF)
### Overview:
- **Simple Approach:**
  - Point a directional antenna in the direction of the strongest signal.
- **Advantages:**
  - Low cost
  - Can be done manually
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Limited accuracy due to antenna beamwidth and mechanical limitations
  - Does not provide geolocation, only directional guidance

---

## Slide 10: RSSI + AOA + Triangulation
### Process:
- **Step Up from RDF:**
  - Given two or more locations (fixes), the target position can be determined using triangulation and the Law of Sines.
  - Example: AP target located at point A, boat takes two fixes (B and C), and the distance B to C is known. The target distance can be calculated using the Law of Sines.

---

## Slide 11: Doppler Direction Finding (DDF)
### Features:
- **Advanced Technique:**
  - Uses multiple antennas and the Doppler effect to determine AOA and distance.
- **Advantages:**
  - Better for moving targets
  - More accurate speed calculation
- **Disadvantage:**
  - Expensive equipment (approx. $3,000 for a professional 2.4 GHz RDF rig)

---

## Slide 12: Time of Arrival (TOA) & Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)
### Applications:
- **Similar to Doppler:**
  - Electronically calculated from multiple antennas.
- **Examples:**
  - Cellular tower signal location
  - People tracking via RFID and WiFi (e.g., AeroScout.com)
  - CISCO 2710 Wireless Location Appliance
- **Advantages:**
  - Excellent for known cell towers or APs
- **Disadvantages:**
  - May not be as accurate
  - Requires existing infrastructure

---

## Slide 13: Building the Wireless Tracker
### Design:
- **Concept:**
  - The tracking device will resemble radar antennas on Navy ships.
- **Components:**
  - Stepper motor for 360-degree rotation
  - Stepping motor controller
  - Laser pointer
  - Miniature 15 dB YAGI antenna
  - Mounting pole and plate (7 feet above the boat deck)
  - Digital compass and GPS

---

## Slide 14: Building the Tracker - Hardware
### Assembly:
- **Mounting:**
  - Stepper motor mounted on a 7” x 7” LEXAN sheet, 2.5 inches above the boat table.
  - Drill holes for motor mount and LEXAN stepper motor "tabletop."
- **Antenna Installation:**
  - Mount the antenna with a ½” aluminum strip to the stepping motor shaft.
  - Use a brass coupler with set screws for secure mounting.

---

## Slide 15: Building the Wireless Tracker - Continued
### Wiring:
- **Control Cable:**
  - Connect the parallel printer (control) cable to the laptop.
  - Wire the stepper motor to the control board, using outputs 1-4 for the four phases.
  - Note: There are six wires on this unipolar motor (wires 5 and 6 go to ground).

---

## Slide 16: Testing the Stepper Motor
### Verification:
- **Testing:**
  - Use the included program StepperV6.EXE to test the stepper motor.
  - The motor steps at 7.5 degrees per step, so 48 steps equal one revolution (one compass rose).

---

## Slide 17: Final Assembly
### Completion:
- **Mounting:**
  - Mount the compass and (optional) laser pointer just above and pointing in the same direction as the YAGI antenna.
  - Connect the laser pointer between output 12 and GND of the control board.
  - The laser pointer can be used at night to illuminate the target AP and direction once maximum signal strength is found.

## Slide 19: Why a Stepper Motor?
### Benefits:

  - No feedback loop required.
  - Repeatable control, suitable for floppy disk drives and flatbed scanners.
  - Can be salvaged from old floppy drives and used in projects like this: [Link to example]

---

## Slide 20: Stepper Motor Operation
### Mechanism:
- **Rotation:**
  - Rotates by energizing phases 1-4 in sequence.
  - Example: Magnet (1) is charged, attracting the topmost four teeth of the sprocket. This results in a 3.6° rotation. Repeat for phases 2-4.

---

## Slide 21: Antenna Selection
### Choice:
- **YAGI Antenna:**
  - Very directional with a high front-to-back ratio.
  - Prevents 180° mistakes in direction finding.
  - Perfect pattern for DF and weighs only 2.9 oz.

---

## Slide 22: Building the Tracker - Software
### Components:
- **Hardware:**
  - PCMCIA Card: Senao 2511 with Prism chipset
  - Front-end monitoring via Netstumbler 0.4.0
- **Software:**
  - Netstumbler script captures signal strength readings on fast scan and writes them to a file.

---

## Slide 23: Building the Tracker - Software
### Backend:
- **Visual Basic:**
  - Controls both stepper motor rotation and signal strength from the Netstumbler script file.
  - Example code: [VB Code snippet]

---

## Slide 24: Software - Programming Sequence
### Steps:
1. Boat cruises looking for the target AP (omni-directional antenna).
2. VB code displays "Target Acquired" splash screen.
3. Switch input to directional antenna.
4. Scan 360 degrees in 7.5° and 3.75° increments.
5. Average three RSSI readings per step.
6. Save the maximum reading and angle.
7. Point the antenna at the target and illuminate the laser.
8. Save GPS coordinates, maximum reading, and angle.
9. Calculate the target AP position given two or more fixes.

## Slide 31: Safety Warning
### Important:
- **Scanner Radiation:**
  - The as-built version of the scanner with a Senao 200 mw high-power card produces an EIRP of 4 watts (the maximum legal limit).
  - Stay at least 36 inches away from any beam antenna and do not point it at vehicle occupants.
- **Laser Safety:**
  - Never operate a laser such that it points directly at another person, especially their eyes.
