we stop. Otherwise, we proceed to step 2 and explore the
“dependence” between the dimension A and dimension B by
computing the conditional (marginal) probability of observ-
ing a value bj in the dimension B given ai in the dimension
A: p(bj|ai) := c p(ai, bj, c)/p(ai). We ﬁnd those substan-
tial bj’s such that p(bj|ai) ≥ δ. If no substantial value exists,
the procedure stops. Otherwise, we proceed to step 3 com-
pute the conditional probability, p(ck|ai, bj), for each ai, bj
and ﬁnd those substantial ck’s, such that p(ck|ai, bj) ≥ δ.
The dominant state analysis procedure produces a set of
dominate states of the following forms: (∗,∗,∗) (i.e., no dom-
inant states), or ai → (∗,∗) (by step 1), ai → bj → ∗ (by
step 2), or ai → bj → ck (by step 3). The set of domi-
nate states is an approximate summary of the ﬂows in the
cluster, and in a sense captures the “most information” of
the cluster. In other words, the set of dominant states of a
cluster provides a compact representation of the cluster.

Figure 6: General procedure for dominant state analysis.
We apply the dominant state analysis to the clusters of
four feature dimensions extracted on all links with varying
δ in [0.1, 0.3]. The results with various δ are very similar,
since the data is amenable to compact dominant state mod-
els. Table 3 (ignoring columns 4-7 for the moment, which we
will discuss in the next subsection) shows dominant states of
srcIP clusters extracted from link L1 over a 1-hour period
using δ = 0.2. For each BC, the ﬁrst row gives the total
number of clusters belonging to the BC during the 1-hour
period (column 2) and the general or prevailing form of the
structural models (column 3) for the clusters. The subse-
quent rows detail the speciﬁc structural models shared by
subsets of clusters and their respective numbers. The no-
tations dstIP(·), srcPrt(· ·· ), etc., indicate a speciﬁc value
and multiple values (e.g., in dstIP) that are omitted for clar-
ity, and [> 90%] denotes that the structural model captures
at least 90% of the ﬂows in the cluster (to avoid too much
clutter in the table, this information is only shown for clus-
ters in BC2). The last column provides brief comments on
the likely nature of the ﬂows the clusters contain, which will
be analyzed in more depth in Section 6.
The results in the table demonstrate two main points.
First, clusters within a BC have (nearly) identical forms of
structural models; they diﬀer only in speciﬁc values they
take. For example, BC2 and BC20 consist mostly of hosts
engaging in various scanning or worm activities using known
exploits, while srcIP clusters in BC6, BC7 and BC8 are
servers providing well-known services. They further sup-
port our assertion that our RU-based behavior classiﬁcation
scheme automatically groups together clusters with simi-
lar behavior patterns, despite that the classiﬁcation is done
oblivious of speciﬁc feature values that ﬂows in the clusters
take. Second, the structural model of a cluster presents a
compact summary of its constituent ﬂows by revealing the
essential information about the cluster (substance feature
values and interaction among the free dimensions). It in it-
self is useful, as it provides interpretive value to network op-
erators for understanding the cluster behavior. These points
also hold for clusters extracted from other dimensions [25].
5.2 Exploring Additional Cluster Features
We now investigate whether additional features (beyond
the four basic features, srcIP, dstIP, srcPrt and dstPrt)
can i) provide further aﬃrmation of similarities among clus-
ters within a BC, and in case of wide diversity, ii) be used to
distinguish sub-classes of behaviors within a BC. Examples
of additional features we consider are cluster sizes (deﬁned
in total ﬂow, packet and byte counts), average packet/byte
count per ﬂow within a cluster and their variability, etc. In
the following we illustrate the results of additional feature
exploration using the average ﬂow sizes per cluster and their
variability.
For each ﬂow fi, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, in a cluster, let P KTi and
BTi denote the number of packets and bytes respectively
in the ﬂow. Compute the average number of packets and
bytes for the cluster, µ(P KT ) = i P KTi/m, µ(BT ) =
i BTi/m. We also measure the ﬂow size variability in
packets and bytes using coeﬃcient of variance, CV (P KT ) =
σ(P KT )/µ(P KT ) and CV (BT ) = σ(BT )/µ(BT ), where
σ(P KT ) and σ(BT ) are the standard deviation of P KTi
and BTi.
In Table 3, columns 4-7, we present the ranges of µ(P KT ),
CV (P KT ), µ(BT ) and CV (BT ) of subsets of clusters with
the similar dominant states, using the 1-hour srcIP clusters
on L1. Columns 4-7 in the top row of each BC are high-level
summaries for clusters within a BC (if it contains more than
one cluster): small, medium or large average packet/byte
count, and low or high variability. We see that for clusters
within BC6, BC7, BC8 and BC18, BC19, the average ﬂow
size in packets and bytes are at least 5 packets and 320 bytes,
and their variabilities (CV (P KT ) and CV (BT )) are fairly
In contrast, clusters in BC2 and BC20 have small
high.
average ﬂow size with low variability, suggesting most of the
ﬂows contain a singleton packet with a small payload. The
same can be said of most of the less popular and rare BCs.
Finally, Figs. 7(a)(b)(c)(d) show the average cluster sizes3
in ﬂow, packet and byte counts for all the unique clusters
from the dataset L1 within four diﬀerent groups of BC’s (the
reason for the grouping will be clear in the next section):
{BC6, BC7, BC8}, {BC18, BC19}, {BC2, BC20}, and the
fourth group containing the remaining less popular BC’s.
Clearly, the characteristics of the cluster sizes of the ﬁrst
two BC groups are quite diﬀerent from those of the second
two BC groups. We will touch on these diﬀerences further
in the next section. To conclude, our results demonstrate
that BC’s with distinct behaviors (e.g., non-akin BC’s) of-
ten also manifest dissimilarities in other features. Clusters
within a BC may also exhibit some diversity in additional
features, but in general the intra-BC diﬀerences are much
less pronounced than inter-BC diﬀerences.
3We compute the average cluster size for clusters appearing
twice or more.
6. APPLICATIONS
We apply our methodology to obtain general proﬁles of
the Internet backbone traﬃc based on the datasets listed
in Table 1. We ﬁnd that a large majority of the (signif-
icant) clusters fall into three “canonical” proﬁles: typical
server/service behavior (mostly providing well-known ser-
vices), typical “heavy-hitter” host behavior (predominantly
associated with well-known services) and typical scan/exploit
behavior (frequently manifested by hosts infected with known
worms). The canonical behavior proﬁles are characterized
along the following four key aspects: (i) BCs they belong to
and their properties, (ii) temporal characteristics (frequency
and stability) of individual clusters, (iii) dominant states,
and (iv) additional attributes such as average ﬂow size in
terms of packet and byte counts and their variabilities.
Clusters with behaviors that diﬀer in one or more aspects
of the three canonical proﬁles automatically present them-
selves as more interesting, thus warrant closer examination.
Generally speaking, there are two types of interesting or
anomalous behaviors we ﬁnd using our behavior proﬁling
methodology:
i) novel or unknown behaviors that match
the typical server/service proﬁle, heavy-hitter host proﬁle,
or scan/exploit proﬁle, but exhibit unusual feature values,
as revealed by analyses of their dominant states; and ii) de-
viant or abnormal behaviors that deviate signiﬁcantly from
the canonical proﬁles in terms of BCs (e.g., clusters belong-
ing to rare BCs), temporal instability (e.g., unstable clusters
that jump between diﬀerent BCs), or additional features.

As shown in Table 4, a typical server providing a well-
known service shows up in either the popular, large and
non-volatile srcIP BC6 [0,2,0], BC7 [0,2,1] and BC8 [0,2,2],
or dstIP BC18 [2,0,0], BC19 [2,0,1] and BC20 [2,0,2] (note
the symmetry between the srcIP and dstIP BCs, with the
ﬁrst two labels (srcPrt and dstPrt) swapped). These BCs
represent the behavior patterns of a server communicating
with a few, many or a large number of hosts. In terms of
their temporal characteristics, the individual clusters asso-
ciated with servers/well-known services tend to have a rel-
atively high frequency, and almost all of them are stable,
re-appearing in the same or akin BCs. The average ﬂow size
(in both packet and byte counts) of the clusters shows high
variability, namely, each cluster typically consists of ﬂows of
diﬀerent sizes.
Looking from the srcPrt and dstPrt perspectives, the
clusters associated with the well-known service ports almost
always belong to the same BC’s, e.g., either srcPrt BC23
[2,1,2] or dstPrt BC25 [2,2,1], representing the aggregate
behavior of a (relatively smaller) number of servers commu-
nicating with a much larger number of clients on a speciﬁc
