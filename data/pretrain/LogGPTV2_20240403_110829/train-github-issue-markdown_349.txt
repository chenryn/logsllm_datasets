Subject: Issue with `unzip` in Deno Docker Setup and Suggested Solution

Hello,

While setting up Deno in a Docker environment, I encountered an issue where the `install.sh` script, which is part of the installation process, requires `unzip`. However, if `unzip` is not installed, the build fails with the error message `unzip is not installed`. Since `unzip` is not a default program in many Docker images, I suggest using `tar` as an alternative for unzipping files. Nevertheless, to resolve the immediate problem, I have successfully installed `unzip` within the Dockerfile.

Here's the updated `RUN` command that worked for me:

```dockerfile
RUN sudo apt-get update && \
    sudo apt-get install -y unzip && \
    curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh && \
    sudo mkdir -p "/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d" && \
    sudo chown "$USER:$USER" "/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d" && \
    "$HOME/.deno/bin/deno" completions bash > "/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/deno.bash" && \
    sudo apt-get clean && \
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Additionally, I set the following environment variables to ensure the Deno binary is accessible in the PATH:

```dockerfile
ENV DENO_INSTALL="/$HOME/.deno"
ENV PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

This solution ensures that `unzip` is available for the installation script, and the necessary directories and permissions are set up correctly for the completion scripts.

If you agree, we could also consider modifying the `install.sh` script to use `tar` instead of `unzip`, which would eliminate the need to install `unzip` in the Docker image. The relevant line in the `install.sh` script can be found [here](https://github.com/denoland/deno_install/blob/master/install.sh#L39).

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
