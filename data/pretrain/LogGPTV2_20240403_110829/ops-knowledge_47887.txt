User: Your company's servers are often attacked by DDoS, please provide an effective defense strategy.
Assistant: DDoS attack is a common network attack, its purpose is to make the attacked server, network or service stop working normally. The following are some effective defense strategies: 1. Increase network bandwidth: increase the capacity of the server by increasing network bandwidth, so as to better resist DDoS attacks. 2. Configure the firewall: Set up the firewall to block malicious traffic and allow only legitimate traffic to enter the server. 3. Use a reverse proxy: Using a reverse proxy as the primary access point for the application can forward the traffic to other addresses before the attack traffic reaches the server, thereby mitigating the impact of DDoS attacks. 4. Distributed defense: use the distributed defense mechanism to disperse the attack traffic to multiple servers for processing, so as to ensure that DDoS attacks will not affect the entire system. 5. Strengthen server security: Implement security policies and update patches for operating systems, services, and applications in a timely manner to mitigate risks caused by security vulnerabilities. In short, an effective DDoS attack defense strategy requires the comprehensive use of multiple methods, and sometimes requires the use of third-party software or services to enhance defense capabilities.
