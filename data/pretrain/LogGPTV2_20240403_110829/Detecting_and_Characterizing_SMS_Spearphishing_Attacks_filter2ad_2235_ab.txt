noticed that the end-user still has the right to manually recover the
message, if one message “looks safe”.
Furthermore, to help the software improve the detection algo-
rithm and capture spam campaigns for law enforcement agencies,
a spam detection log would be generated and uploaded to cloud
servers for further security analysis. As for the detection log, it
contains not only the message content and sender information,
but also timestamp, city location, and hashed International Mo-
bile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and International Mobile Subscriber
Identity (IMSI) by the SHA256 algorithm (to protect user privacy).
For this work, our industry partner provided us with all the spam
detection logs, except for spam classified as commercial marketing
promotion with two considerations. The first one is to protect user
privacy, as the percentage of commercial promotion is significantly
high (>99% of all spam logs), it may leak sensitive information of
users, such as browsing habits. Second, SMS spearphishing attacks
are less likely to appear in marketing messages. However, other

email starting with “Hi, username”). However, the same facility
could not be offered by phone-number. Therefore, a spearphishing
email attacker can carry out a targeted scam simply by getting
the victim’s email address. While for speraphishing SMS attackers,
the collection of meaningful PIIs (personal identifier information)
besides phone-numbers, such as the victims’ Name and ID number,
becomes an extra prerequisite. The personal information may re-
quire additional stealing operations, or be obtained from existing
leaked database.
Threat Model. Based on the above analysis, we could summarise
the threat model of spearphishing SMS as Figure 2. Assume that
Mallory is the attacker, who tries to fool a targeted victim, Alice,
through targeted deceptive SMS content, and then exploits the trust
to induce Alice to perform dangerous actions. The attack process
could be divided into two phases, “luring” and “exploiting”.
During the luring phase, Mallory is required to gain Alice’s trust,
i.e., preparing to frame sufficiently deceptive fraudulent messages.
To achieve this, Mallory would first extensively collect Alice’s per-
sonal information, such as the Phone-Name pair (and possibly other
PIIs, e.g. ID card), and then disguise Alice as a trusted entity by
crafting and sending fraud SMS messages embedded with Alice’s
PIIs.
In addition to constructing targeted content to gain Alice’s trust,
Mallory would also embed malicious payloads into the SMS content
to trick Alice into executing them for tangible profit, which is
termed as the exploiting phase. Specifically, this process happens
after Alice is scammed by the carefully crafted fraudulent content.
Then, Alice will execute various types of embedded payloads in
the text, i.e., several follow-up contacts that trigger subsequent
fraudulent activity, including: (1) clicking on URLs that distribute
malware or steal credentials, and (2) triggering out-of-band actions
(e.g., wiring money or making phone calls).
In other words, we focus on attacks where attackers harvest large-
scale victims’ personal information and craft fraudulent spearphish-
ing short messages to masquerading as trusted entities.
Research goal. To perform the first exploration of the spearphish-
ing SMS ecosystem, one prerequisite is obtaining a real-world
dataset as the research basis. Perhaps the most ideal way is that,
we as the researchers to design and deploy one detector operating
on real-world clients that distinguish spearphishing SMS from le-
gitimate ones directly. However, it is not considered in this work
for ethical reasons. Directly detecting spearphishing requires the
researchers to monitor, read, and process all the SMS data received
by real users. It meanwhile inevitably exposes the researchers to
legitimate SMS messages, which may contain sensitive information,
and thus poses serious privacy risks.

fraudulent messages are commonly used to launch malicious ac-
tivities, such as phishing and illegal promotion. Therefore, their
related data can be shared with researchers for security analysis.
Totally, we collected three months spam detection log from De-
cember 28, 2019 to March 25, 2020, containing 31,956,437 fraudu-
lent messages, and covering all provinces in China.
Limitation of Dataset. Although we tried to make this study as
comprehensive as possible, there are still some limitations here.
First, our dataset is collected from a mobile application in China,
so it may have a geographical bias due to the user distribution.
However, the long-term large user base of our industry partner
and millions of monthly active users of 360 Mobile Safe make a
very comprehensive national coverage. Therefore, the collected
dataset could be comprehensive enough for a country-level study.
Second, to protect user’s sensitive information, we only collect
the spam detection logs which are not identified as commercial
marketing promotions. SMS spearphishing attacks are less likely
to appear in marketing messages, based on the studies on the na-
ture of spearphishing attacks via other channels [11, 25, 26, 55].
So the SMS spearphishing attacks we detected are representative.
Dataset collection in previous works only focuses on the common
spam SMS [48] and spearphishing attacks via other channels, e.g.
email [11, 26]. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first
one from which we can detect considerable SMS spearphishing
attacks.
3.2 Ethical Considerations
The nature of our research, i.e., detecting SMS spearphishing attacks
embedded with personally identifiable information (PII), dictates
the challenges we must face when dealing with sensitive datasets.
As Institutional Review Board (IRB) has rarely been established in
Chinese research institutions yet, we were unable to obtain an IRB
approval. Nevertheless, we take the utmost effort to complement
the review function of IRB. Specifically, the entire study was con-
ducted during the researchers’ internship within that company. All
their operations, including data collection, data analysis and data
storage, complied with the ethical requirements in the cooperation
agreement. And the entire data processing steps were supervised
by the company’s legal committee. In addition, we carefully ad-
here to ethical guidelines for cybersecurity research, including the
recommendations from Partridge and Allman [3], and the Menlo
Report [16]. Below we discuss the ethical considerations in detail
before presenting our methodology.
Data Collection. (1) The collection of spam detection logs is dom-
inated by our industrial partner. The entire process has proven to be
in strict compliance with the data privacy policies of the 360 Mobile
Safe legal committee, and is subject to their oversight; (2) When
installing the security application, users receive a consent [50]
form that details what types of data would be collected, how their
privacy would be protected and the usages of the collected data.
Specifically, it also clearly states that the data could be provided to
research institutions for academic usages. Meanwhile, one neces-
sary condition is, all published academic results must ensure that
no sensitive information would be released. In this work, we take
adequate anonymization effort and avoid making any potentially
sensitive analysis. We believe it satisfies the condition of academic
data usage as stated in the user consent. Besides, users are also
informed of the benefits and potential risks of turning on spam
detection, and then voluntarily decide whether to join in and have
the right to opt-out at any time.
Data Analysis. During the data analysis process, we work closely
with professional lawyers to ensure that each step is legal. We also
tried our best to balance the beneficence of experiments and the
potential risks. (1) We took much effort with our industrial partner
on dataset anonymization. First, all the device-related identifiers,
including the IMSI (unique identifier of SIM Card) and IMEI (unique
identifier of Mobile Equipment) of mobile phone users, were hashed
before being provided to us. Then, through a manual inspection
on a small dataset in empirical study, we found several types of
victims’ PIIs could be embedded in the message content, such as
victims’ Name, ID Numbers and Flight Information. Then, regular
expressions were built to detect and replace these PIIs with hashes
by scripts (see Section 4.1 for details). It ensures that the researchers
would not be exposed to sensitive information as much as possible;
(2) We signed a cooperation agreement with the security vendor to
ensure the data processing is completed on the company’s virtual
environment and all the data is kept confidential; (3) We also double-
checked the measurement findings published in this paper, to ensure
that no personal information was inadvertently disclosed.
Data Storage. All the detection logs are stored on confidential
servers within the industrial company with security reinforcements.
Investigators accessed the data as interns. All data are not allowed
to be copied to external networks.
In summary, we have employed a set of best practices to mitigate
potential ethical concerns. And we believe the beneficence of the
first spotlight on SMS spearphishing attack and further understand-
ing of this threat outweighs its potential ethical risks.
4 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we first present an empirical study of manually label-
ing and inspecting ground-truth dataset as a guideline. Then, lever-
aging three insights gained from the empirical study, we propose a
detection system that is able to detect SMS spearphishing attack
from fraudulent messages. An overview of the system architecture,
implementation details and evaluation results are elaborated in the
following subsections.
4.1 Empirical Study
Ground-truth dataset. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
public dataset available for SMS spearphishing attack. Therefore,
we bootstrap our study by inspecting a huge number of fraudulent
SMS collected by 360 Mobile Safe, and manually label spearphishing
messages to create the ground-truth dataset.
We randomly selected 50,000 fraudulent messages from the entire
dataset assembled a labeling team of two investigators. To establish
consensus among members, we first sampled a set of 5,000 messages
(10%) for the investigators to label independently, and reached an
agreement score of 89.30%. Following this, a senior mobile security
expert was invited to review and discuss the inconsistent results
with our team. During this process, a set of empirical guidelines
were summarized to distinguish SMS spearphishing attacks from
regular spam messages. After review, all conflicts in the first round
933Detecting and Characterizing SMS Spearphishing Attacks
ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
labeling were resolved, and no inconsistent results appeared for
the labeling of the remaining 90% messages.
In total, we labeled 1,196 messages (2.39% of 50,000) as spearphish-
ing and regarded this dataset as ground-truth. To factorize business
types of spearphishing attacks, we also provide an empirical multi-
classification of messages, which will be described in Sec 4.3.
Key observations. Traditional detection mechanisms of spearphish-
ing attacks (e.g., email) are effective when they behave spoofing or
phishy emotion [11, 69] identified by Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tools. However, in our case, those approaches are not effec-
tive. The most significant challenge is that the length of SMS text is
too short, which may lead to unpredictable errors in conventional
NLP topic modeling and sentiment analysis [53, 62]. As such, new
features are needed to distinguish spearphishing SMS attacks in the
context of spamming. We discover three key observations through
empirical analysis of ground-truth, which can help to build the
detection system, as elaborated below.
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they have certain string for-
mats which could be identified by regular matching. We manually
built the specific regular expression for each type of the four PIIs,
as examples presented in the last column of Table 5. Our industry
partner then helped detect and replace all these PIIs with hashes
on the entire dataset, using scripts we built based on NER and the
above regular expressions. Afterwards, the sufficiently anonymized
dataset was re-provided to us for subsequent data processing and
analysis.
4.2 System Design and Implementation
Design Overview. Inspired by the three observations gained from
the empirical study, we are able to design a detection system.
This system aims to accurately identify SMS spearphishing attacks
through collaborating with a mobile security application that de-
tects unsolicited messages at the client-side.
• “Luring”: Personal information of victims. To make victims
feel trustworthy or familiar, we observed that all spearphish-
ing messages were customized by the victim’s Name (or Last
Name). In several special scenarios, Flight Information, Plate
Number, Bank Card Number and ID Card Number were even
included to enhance the allure.
• “Exploiting”: Out-of-band contacts of attackers. From the view
of the attacker, it is unprofitable to simply spread unsolicited
information. An adversary must embed at least one follow-
up contact (e.g., click on URLs, contact with social accounts)
to carry out subsequent fraudulent activity. One may argue
the need to embed contact in the message since the sender of
the message is a natural contact to call back. However, it is
more costly for attackers to scam by calling back directly [59]
as it requires maintaining a fixed contact device and serving
real-time human interaction on it all the time.
• “Syntactic”: Syntactic relationship of personal pronouns. How-
ever, the above two features alone cannot accurately distin-
guish SMS spearphishing attacks from illegal promotions.
Since some attackers may also embed their Names in mes-
sages, as the bottom case shown in Figure 4. Therefore, we
need not only to identify the embedded personal informa-
tion, but also to determine whether it belongs to the victim.
Fortunately, we observe that the texts of spearphishing mes-
sages are often crafted in the tone of a conversation between
the attacker and the victim, while the attacker is always the
initiator. With the help of syntactic analysis in NLP, we find
a difference between attacker and victim in the syntactic
structures of their pronouns.
Anonymization. By manually inspecting the raw data of 1,196
labeled spearphishing SMS, we found 5 types of PIIs could be em-
bedded in the message content, as shown in Table 2. For privacy
reasons, these PIIs should also be anonymized, and we take this
anonymization as a necessary step in the data processing work-
flow of this work (as part of Step II Entity Recognition, see
Section 4.2). Specifically, Name of the victim could be identified by
Name Entity Recognition (NER) and then be replaced by hashes
directly. Although the other four types of PII are not typical “Entity”
Figure 3: Overview of the detection system.
Figure 3 abstracts the system workflow. As the first step, the
system extracts necessary fields from spam detection logs, and
tries to process obfuscated text. The pre-processed text goes to
the Entity Recognition module, which attempts to find customized
personal information and contacts. Subsequently, the text with
labeled entities is forwarded to the Syntactic Parsing module, which
distinguishes the attribution of extracted personal information. If
the personal information belongs to the victim, the message will be
marked as a spearphishing message. Otherwise, the message will
be considered as regular promotion (labeled as “common spam”).
