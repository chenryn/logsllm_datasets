Let's assume we have an application with sessions with the following routes:
/1  
/1/2  
/1/2/3  
/1/3
The first path, when called from a WebTestCase, will create a cookie in the
local Client object with the path set to "/". Calling the second route will
renew the cookie, setting its path to /1. The third will update the cookie's
path to /1/2.
Now when I call the fourth route, the cookie is not available any more for
that request, because it is set to another path (/1/2 instead of / or /1). The
cookie will not be sent and therefore the application will create a new
cookie. This breaks my test cases, obviously.
Please let me know if this is an error on my side, or if I can provide further
information with this problem.
