In the normal condition, a participant is only asked to perform
login tasks without any time pressure or secondary tasks. It corre-
sponds to the combination of relaxed mode and no-extra-task sta-
tus, which is used as a baseline in our tests.

in the normal condition. For all the three schemes, most partici-
pants are able to ﬁnish the login within 13 seconds. Figure 7(b)
and 7(c) show the corresponding login accuracy. Since our experi-
ment limits the number of login attempts to 5 in order to prevent the
participants from feeling exhausted or bored, even a single mistake
would take the login success rate down to 80%. Our results indicate
that most participants make at most one mistake when they use our
schemes for the ﬁrst time after a short training. This is shown by
97.5% average round success rate and 0.13 average edit distance
in the worst case. Particularly, for the distribution of average edit
distance of NumPad-Shift, 27 participants among 40 samples (after
removing the experimental data when NumPad-Shift appears as the
ﬁrst test group) has an average edit distance of zero (i.e. no mis-
takes during all tests under the test condition), which are shown as
a cluster of outliers at the bottom of the box chart. The login accu-
racy is expected to increase after the participants get more familiar
with the schemes.
Inﬂuence of Time Pressure
5.4.2
Figure 8 shows the impact of time pressure without any sec-
ondary tasks. The results show that the participants behave much
hastily in the presence of time pressure. The average time for a
successful login attempt becomes shorter and the login accuracy is
decreased. The statistical tests show the difference in login time
is signiﬁcant (p=.017 for NumPad-Add and p<.001 for LetterPad-
Shift) but the difference in login accuracy is not. Therefore, H1 is
supported while H2 is not.
The insigniﬁcant results in login accuracy are due to the ceil-
ing effect [1], which implies the tests are not sufﬁciently difﬁcult
to distinguish the inﬂuence of different test conditions. This effect
could be caused by our scheme design, which is not difﬁcult for
the participants to use so that the majority of the participants did
not make any mistakes during all the tests. This effect will be fur-
ther discussed in Appendix A. However, even without statistical
signiﬁcance, we still observe the average results of login accuracy
become worse for all three tested schemes. Considering the simple
design of our schemes, this indicates that time pressure may have a
larger inﬂuence on the login accuracy of a more complex scheme.
Inﬂuence of Distraction
5.4.3
Figure 9 shows the impact of distraction without time pressure.
Many participants made a mistake when they saw a distraction task
for the ﬁrst time (however, NumPad-Shift is an exception). For
NumPad-Add and LetterPad-Shift shown in Figure 9(b), the round
success rate returns to a comparable level as the normal condi-
tion, after the ﬁrst time the distraction task appears. This indicates
that the distraction task is no longer a surprise for the participants.
However, even after the participants get familiar with the distrac-
tion tasks, compared to the normal condition, the success rate is
still lower, the average edit distance is larger, and the average lo-
gin time is longer. But the statistical tests show these differences
are not signiﬁcant. Therefore, H3 and H4 are not supported in our
experiments.
Inﬂuence of Mental Workload
5.4.4
Figure 10 shows the impact of mental workload without time
pressure. The average login time becomes signiﬁcantly longer with
mental workload (p=.003 for NumPad-Add) due to context switch
in users’ mind between password inputs and secondary CRT tasks.
An extra startup time is required to release the central executive af-
ter each CRT task. Our experiment simulates the case when users
cannot get rid of other thoughts during password entry. The actual
effect of mental workload depends on the status of users’ mind.
The impact may be elevated when the actual mental workload is
higher than our CRT tasks. On the other hand, the login accu-
racy is lower compared to the normal condition but the difference
is not signiﬁcant due to the same ceiling effect mentioned in Sec-
tion 5.4.2. Therefore, H5 is supported and H6 is not. These results

show that persistent mental workload signiﬁcantly slows the pro-
cess of password entry for our schemes.
5.4.5 Performance under Combined Conditions
We also examine the overall impact when distraction or mental
workload appears together with time pressure. As expected, com-
pared to their counterparts without time pressure, the average login
time becomes shorter (from 10.3 seconds to 11.7 seconds on av-
erage), the login success rate becomes even lower (from 81.3% to
87.5%), and the average edit distance becomes larger (from 0.151
to 0.243). The statistical tests show the difference in login time
is signiﬁcant (p=.009 for NumPad-Add, p=.019 for NumPad-Shift,
and p<.001 for LetterPad-Shift) and the difference in login accu-
racy is still not signiﬁcant due to the ceiling effect explained in
Section 5.4.2. Therefore, H7 is supported but H8 is not. These
results show time pressure is still an effective stimulus to speed
password entry even in the presence of secondary tasks.
5.4.6 Effectiveness of Secondary Tasks
Figure 11 shows the distribution of the accuracy rate which
represents the percentage of secondary tasks being correctly per-
formed by a participant under certain test condition. The overall
average accuracy rate is 98.3% across all these test conditions. It
implies that the participants did pay attention to these tasks, as they
were told that the performance of these tasks also contributes to
their scores in the ranking system. Therefore, these CRT tasks work
as intended in disturbing participants’ mind during password entry.
5.4.7 Memory Interference by Mental Calculation
Figure 12 shows how frequently a participant presses the “show
my password” button during all tests in a test group. Note that
the participants are not allowed to write down their assigned pass-
words, but they can always click that button in case they forgot
their passwords. The overall average value for the total number of

tion involved in the hidden transformation of our schemes does not
pose a signiﬁcant interference on participants’ capability of recall-
ing their passwords.
5.4.8 User Perception
Figure 13 shows the perception of participants collected from
questionnaires. The results indicate that the participants generally
feel that our schemes are secure and easy to use. While NumPad-
Add is the most popular, the other two schemes also have their
favorite users.
5.5 Comparison with Legacy Passwords
Table 2 gives a comparison between CoverPad and legacy pass-
words based on the usability-deployability-security metrics pro-
posed in [10], where a metric is not shown if neither our schemes
nor legacy passwords offer corresponding beneﬁt. We have the fol-
lowing observations in comparison. 1) Our schemes are rated as not
mature since they are just proposed and have not been widely de-
ployed. 2) Our schemes are not server-compatible, as most current
servers support only static and replayable passwords, which could
be changed in the near future. 3) Our schemes are quasi-resilient-
to-internal-observation in a sense that any key logger or malware
which fails to capture the hidden transformation causes no pass-
word leakage. Overall, this table shows that our schemes signiﬁ-
cantly improve the security strength while retaining most beneﬁts
of legacy passwords.
