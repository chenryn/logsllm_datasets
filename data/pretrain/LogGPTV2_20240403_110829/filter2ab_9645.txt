**ATT&CK ID:** T1554  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Compromise Client Software Binary

Adversaries may compromise and modify client software binaries to establish persistent access to a target system. Client software is used by users to access services provided by a server. Common examples of client software include SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, and web browsers. By tampering with these binaries, attackers can introduce malicious functionality that allows them to maintain long-term access and control over the compromised system.
