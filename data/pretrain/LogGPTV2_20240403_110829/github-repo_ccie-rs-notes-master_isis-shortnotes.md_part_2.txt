* Rx and Tx could be independent
**Other three fields help, as such: -**
* If no IIH from B, A sending IIH with Extended LCID only, set to Router As outgoing int ID, no other fields present
* When IIH arrives from B and accepted, A puts B's sys ID in neighbour SysID field, Bs Extended LCID in Neighbour Ext LCID field, sent back to B
IIH carrying three way adj state TLV accepted only if one of following: -
* Neighbour Sys ID and Ext LCID not present
* Nei Sys ID matches own Sys ID, Nei Ext LCID mathes own int ID
* If not, IIH silently dropped
* **isis three-way-handshake ietf** - Backwards compat with cisco
* After adj, routers sync LSDB
* Marks all LSPs for flooding over p2p link
* CSNPs sent to each other
* CSNPs could be exchanged before LSP transmission takes place (periodic scheduling)
* If CSNP has LSP that marked for sending, router unmarks LSP
* Only missing sent
* Requests sent for any unknown with PSNP
* Above unnecessary as all LSPs flooded without CSNP and PSNP aid on initilization
* Every LSP sent over P2P link must be ack'd (even during initial sync)
* Each sent LSP acked by corresponding PSNP from neighbour
* If neighbour also sends periodic CSNPs, also valid ACKs
* Some vendors do do this on P2Ps
* Ciscos dont, enable with **isis csnp-interval interval [level]**
### Operation over B'Cast
* Adj, sync db, keep syncd
* Packets encaped in 802.2 LLCs with DSAP and SSP set to 0xFE
* All L1 packets multicasted to 0180.c200.0014, L2 to 0180.c200.0015
* IIH detects neighbours
* Lists neighbouring routers on b'cast int in IIH it sends out
* If router sees own SNPA in IIH, bidi vis and adj to up
* If not, adj in initializing state
Every b'cast has DIS. No backup dis. Elected as such: -
* Router with highest int priority
* Highest SNPA
* If SNPAs not comparable, highest system ID (use on FR and ATM phy and mp)
* On above, each router sees itself and neighbour on same VC, ID'd by same DLCI/VPI/VCI, multiple VCs terminated on interface, ambigirous which VCID for SNPA
* Priority in range 0-127
* **isis priority priority [level]**
* 0 excludes router from DIS
* DIS election preemptive
* Performed on each rx'd IIH
* All routers on b'cast segement fully adj
* Every router sends LSP on b'cast link
* All other can accept
**DIS Purpose**
* Help routers on segment to sync
* Represent segment in LSDB as standalone object - pseudonode
* Sync where DIS creates and sends CSNP in regular interval (10s by default)
* CSNP lists all LSPs in DIS's LSDB
* Results of receiving this could be
 * Same LSP and LSPID and seq, no action
 * Does not have LSP with LSPID or seq on DIS higher, router sends PSNP
 * Router has same LSP with same LSPID, higher Seq. Router floods LSP on network immediately
* Reference point of LSPs
* No explicit ack of LSPs, just seen in next CSNP from DIS
* PSNPs only for LSP request
* Represents b'cast in LSDB for simpler topology model
 * Each router claims connectivity to b'vast netwtork
 * Network claims connectivity to each router
* DIS originates PS LSP
* Each LSP has SysID, PSID and LSP frag number
* For network LSPs, Sys ID is of DIS< PSID is LCID of DIS's int on network
* Shorter hello and hold (one third of config'd)
* Fails quicker
* If DIS fails, router elected in place
* ONly thing needed is to replace PS LSP with new one, remaining routers update LSPs to point towards new PSLSP
## Areas
* Routers in single area only due to one NSAP
* Three NSAps in single IS-IS possible, providing SysID identical, and only AreaID different
* Only LSDB mantainained, with config'd ares merged (useful for splitting/joining or renumbering areas)
* Add second NSAP with new AreaID, and old NSAP removed, no adj flaps
* During stable operation, should be one NSAP per IS-IS process
* Entire high order part of NSAP up to SysID is area ID
* Makes sure all routers uses same format
* Different LSDBs for L1 and L2
* Each L1 router advertises directly connected IP nets in L1 LSP
* Neighbouring L1s in diff areas never adj
* L1 routers keep intra-area info contained
* L2 routing only converned with Area IDs
* l2 routers form backbone of domain
 * Must be contiguous
 * Pervades all areas within domain
* IP has no embedded area info
* Each L2 router advertises directly connected IP networks to achieve contiguous IP backbone connectivity
* Also avdertises all other L1 routes from own area
* While LSPs not leaked on L2 routers, IP routing info computed from L1 LSDB injected into L2 LSP
* No opposite flow
* L2 domain knows all IP network sin domain
* L1 similar to OSPF Totally Stubby, or at least NSSA-TS if external routes present
* L2 routers ignore area boundaries for adj and flooding, any area can form adj
* Default of L1L2 operation in IOS
**FLags in show isis database**
* ATT (Attached) - When L1L2 router performs L2 calc, and can reach other area besides own, sets ATT flag in LSP to indicate working attachment to other areas. L1 routers create default route towards any router with ATT bit set
* P (Partition Repair) - Feature that allows healing partitioned area over L2 subdomain (like Virtual Link), not on Cisco routers
* O (Overload) - Signals router unable to store all LSPs in memory, so don't use as routed path. Ignored when computing SPF. Still takes directly attached networks though.
* O bit can be used for maintenance, or bringing new router in network
* Allows settling of BGP table for example
 * Can be set for on reboot, or BGP signals convergence
* Suummarization should be config'd on each L1L2 router in area
* **summary-address** - Under process
* Applies euqually to intra-area networks from L1 to L2, and redist
# Auth in IS-IS
* IIH authed indepdnent of LSP, CSNP and PSNP
* Auth added as additional TLV
* LSPs must not be modded, so for L1 LSPs within area, must use same area password
* All L2 routers within L2 subdomain must use same domain password to auth LSPs
* LAN IIH - L1 - **isis auth mode {text | md5 } level 1, isis auth key-chain name level-1** - Interface Commands
* LAN IIH - L2 - **isis auth mode {text | md5 } level 2, isis auth key-chain name level-2** - Interface Commands
* P2P IIH - **isis auth mode {text | md5}, isis auth key-chain name**
* LSP, CSNP, PSNP - Level 1 - **auth mode {text | md5} level-1, auth key-chain name level-1** - Process command
* LSP, CSNP, PSNP - Level 2 - **auth mode {text | md5} level-2, auth key-chain name level-2** - Process command
* Can be activated for either, both or none
* IIH auth only direct neighborus
* If IIH fails, no adj
* If IIH Pass but non IIH fails, Up but no LSDB sync
* MD5 auth added in RFC3567 (then 5394)
* Key IDs not carried, so only key-string needs to match
# V6 support
* Identical rules for v6 as v4
* No different as no L3 protocol carrying packets
* Different AFs in a single instance
