User: How to improve application performance, reduce request response time and memory usage?
Assistant: 1. Optimize the database: reduce query time and improve data reading efficiency by performing operations such as indexing, compression, and partitioning on the database. 2. Use cache: Use cache to reduce queries and IO operations on the database and improve application performance, such as using Redis or Memcache for data caching. 3. Optimize network requests: Make reasonable use of HTTP cache and browser cache to avoid repeated requests and transmission of a large amount of useless data, which can reduce request response time. 4. Use CDN to accelerate: Using CDN technology can accelerate resource loading, reduce network transmission time and bandwidth consumption. 5. Optimize code: For time-consuming operations, use asynchronous or parallel processing to reduce blocking time; avoid using too many global variables and recursive operations to reduce memory usage. 6. Server hardware upgrade: If the performance problem of the application is mainly caused by insufficient hardware configuration, you can consider upgrading the server configuration, such as expanding the CPU, increasing memory, using SSD hard disk, etc. 7. Regularly clean up junk data: remove obsolete or useless data and files, reduce server load, and improve application performance.
