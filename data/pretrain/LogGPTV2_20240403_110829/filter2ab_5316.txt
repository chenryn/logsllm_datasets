**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

Regularly audit domain account permission levels to identify any situations that could allow an adversary to gain broad access by compromising the credentials of a privileged account. Avoid adding user or administrative domain accounts to local administrator groups across multiple systems, unless these accounts are strictly controlled and their usage is segmented. This practice is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the same password on all systems, which significantly increases the risk of widespread compromise.

Adhere to best practices for the design and administration of enterprise networks to limit the use of privileged accounts across different administrative tiers. Minimize credential overlap across systems to prevent unauthorized access if account credentials are compromised.
