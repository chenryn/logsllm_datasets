Abstract—This work investigates the fundamental constraints
of anonymous communication (AC) protocols. We analyze the
relationship between bandwidth overhead, latency overhead, and
sender anonymity or recipient anonymity against the global
passive (network-level) adversary. We conﬁrm the trilemma that
an AC protocol can only achieve two out of the following three
properties: strong anonymity (i.e., anonymity up to a negligible
chance), low bandwidth overhead, and low latency overhead.
We further study anonymity against a stronger global passive
adversary that can additionally passively compromise some of the
AC protocol nodes. For a given number of compromised nodes,
we derive necessary constraints between bandwidth and latency
overhead whose violation make it impossible for an AC protocol
to achieve strong anonymity. We analyze prominent AC protocols
from the literature and depict to which extent those satisfy our
necessary constraints. Our fundamental necessary constraints
offer a guideline not only for improving existing AC systems
but also for designing novel AC protocols with non-traditional
bandwidth and latency overhead choices.
I. INTRODUCTION
Millions of users from all over the world employ anonymous
communication networks, such as Tor [1], to protect their
privacy over the Internet. The design choice made by the
Tor network to keep the latency and bandwidth overheads
small has made it highly attractive to its geographically
diverse user-base. However, over the last decade, the academic
literature [2]–[8] has demonstrated Tor’s vulnerability to a
variety of trafﬁc correlation attacks. In fact, Tor also has been
successfully attacked in practice [9].
It is widely accepted that low-latency low-bandwidth over-
head of anonymous communication (AC) protocols, such as
Tor [10], can only provide a weak form of anonymity [11].
In the anonymity literature, several AC protocols were able
to overcome this security barrier to provide a stronger anony-
mity guarantee (cryptographic indistinguishability based ano-
nymity [12], [13]) by either increasing the latency overhead or
the bandwidth overhead. In particular, high-latency approaches
(such as threshold mix networks [14]) can ensure strong
anonymity by introducing signiﬁcant communication delays
for users messages, while high-bandwidth approaches (such as
Dining Cryptographers network [15] and its extensions [16]–
[18]) can provide strong anonymity by adding copious noise
(or dummy) messages.
There have been a few efforts to propose hybrid ap-
proaches [19]–[24] that try to provide anonymity by simultane-
ously introducing latency and bandwidth overhead. However,
it is not clear how to balance such system parameters to ensure
strong anonymity while preserving practical performance.
In general, in the last 35 years a signiﬁcant amount of
research efforts have been put
towards constructing novel
AC protocols, deploying them, and attacking real-world AC
networks. However, unlike other security ﬁelds such as cryp-
tography, our understanding regarding the fundamental limits
and requirements of AC protocols remains limited. This work
takes some important steps towards answering fundamental
question associated with anonymous communication. “Can we
prove that strong anonymity cannot be achieved without intro-
ducing large latency or bandwidth overhead? When we wish to
introduce the latency and bandwidth overheads simultaneously,
do we know the overhead range values that still fall short at
providing stronger anonymity?”
Our Contribution. We conﬁrm a previously conjectured [24],
[25] relationship between bandwidth overhead, latency over-
head and anonymity. We ﬁnd that
there are fundamental
bounds on sender and recipient anonymity properties [12],
[13], [26], [27] of a protocol that directly depend on the
introduced bandwidth and latency overheads.
This work presents a generic model of AC protocols using
petri nets [28], [29] such that different instantiations of this
model will represent different AC protocols, covering most
practical AC systems in the literature. We derive upper bounds
on anonymity as functions of bandwidth overhead and latency
overhead, against two prominent adversary classes: global pas-
sive network-level adversaries and strictly stronger adversaries
that additionally (passively) compromise some protocol parties
(e.g., relays in case of Tor). These bounds constitute necessary
constraints for anonymity. Naturally, the constraints are valid
against any stronger adversary class as well.
For both adversary classes, we analyze two different user
distributions (i.e., distributions that determine at which time or
rate users of the AC protocol send messages): (i) synchronized
user distributions, where users globally synchronize their mes-
sages, and (ii) unsynchronized user distributions, where each
user locally decides when to send his messages independent
of other users.
We analyze the trade-off between latency overhead and
bandwidth overhead required to achieve strong anonymity,
i.e., anonymity up to a negligible (in a security parameter η)
chance of failure. For any AC protocol where only a fraction

of β ∈ [0, 1] users send noise messages per communication
round, and where messages can only remain in the network
for (cid:4) ≥ 0 communication rounds, we ﬁnd that against
a global network-level adversary no protocol can achieve
strong anonymity if 2β(cid:4) < 1 − 1/poly(η) even when all
the protocol parties are honest. In the case where a strictly
stronger adversary additionally passively compromises c (out
of K) protocol parties, we show that strong anonymity is
impossible if 2((cid:4) − c)β < 1 − 1/poly(η) (for c < (cid:4)), or
2β(cid:4) < 1 − 1/poly(η) and (cid:4) ∈ O(1) (for c ≥ (cid:4)).
We also assess the practical
impact of our results by
analyzing prominent AC protocols. Our impossibility results
naturally only offer necessary constraints for anonymity, but
not sufﬁcient conditions for the AC protocol. However, these
necessary constraints for sender and recipient anonymity are
crucial for understanding bi-directional anonymous commu-
nication. In fact, we ﬁnd that several AC protocols in the
literature are asymptotically close to the suggested constraints.
Moreover, designers of new AC protocols can use our nec-
essary constraints as guidelines for avoiding bad trade-off
between latency and bandwidth-overhead.
II. OVERVIEW
A. Formalization and Adversary Model
AC Protocols as Petri Nets. We deﬁne a view of AC
protocols as petri nets [28]–[30], i.e., as graphs with two
types of labeled nodes: places, that store colored tokens, and
transitions, that deﬁne how these tokens are sent over the
graph. In our case, each colored token represents a message,
places are the protocol parties that can receive, hold and send
messages, and transitions describe how parties exchange and
relay messages. Our model captures all AC protocols under the
assumption that messages are transmitted directly, i.e., in order
for Bob to receive a message from Alice, Alice has to send the
message and the message (albeit relayed, delayed and crypto-
graphically modiﬁed) eventually has to reach Bob. While this
requirement may sound strict, as elaborated in Section IV-B,
we effectively only exclude few esoteric protocols.
User Distributions, Communication Rounds, Bandwidth
Overhead, and Latency. We consider two types of user
distributions. In the ﬁrst user distribution (synchronized) N
users send their messages in exactly N rounds (see Figure 1
for notations). Per round, exactly one user sends a message.
The protocol decides which users send noise messages in each
round. In the second user distribution (unsynchronized) each
user independently decides whether to send a message in a
round using a coin ﬂip, with a success probability p.
The model considers synchronous communication rounds as
in [16], [17], [31], [32]. We model latency overhead (cid:4) as the
number of rounds a message can be delayed by the protocol
before being delivered. We formalize bandwidth overhead β
as the number of noise messages per user that the protocol
can create in every round, i.e., the dummy message rate.
Our two types of user distributions cover a large array of
possible scenarios. Results for our user distributions imply
(cid:2) Latency overhead for every message
β Bandwidth overhead for every user per round
p Probability to send a message per user per round
K Number of (internal) protocol parties
c Number of compromised protocol parties
N Number of online users (that may send messages)

results for similar distributions, if a reduction proof can show
that they are less favorable to the protocol.1
Adversaries. We consider global passive non-compromising
adversaries,
that can observe all communication between
protocol parties; and strictly stronger partially compromising
(passive) adversaries, that can compromise protocol parties to
learn the mapping between inputs and outputs for this party.
Anonymity Property. We leverage an indistinguishability
based anonymity notion for sender anonymity: the adversary
has to distinguish two senders of its own choosing [12], [13].
For a security parameter η, we say that a protocol achieves
strong anonymity, if the adversary’s advantage remains negligi-
ble in η. Strong anonymity is relative to a strength η, which is
bound to system parameters or analysis parameters such as the
number of users or protocol parties, the latency overhead and
the bandwidth overhead. These parameters typically increase
as η increases, which improves the protocol’s anonymity.2
Anonymity in relation to η uniﬁes a wide variety of possible
analyses on how the anonymity bound changes with changing
system parameters, and user numbers and behaviors.
B. Brief Overview of the Proof Technique
As non-compromising adversaries are a subset of partially
compromising adversaries, our proof technique for the former
is a simpliﬁed case of the latter. In general, we derive our
results in four main steps.
First, we deﬁne a concrete adversary Apaths, that uses a well
established strategy: upon recognizing the challenge message
(as soon as it reaches a receiver) Apaths constructs the possible
paths this message could have taken through the network, and
tries to identify the user who has sent the message.
Second, given the concrete adversary Apaths, we identify a
necessary invariant that any protocol has to fulﬁll in order to
provide anonymity. Intuitively: both challenge users chosen by
the adversary must be active (i.e., send at least one message)
before the challenge message reaches the recipient, and it
must be possible for these messages to meet in at least one
honest party along the way. We prove that indeed this natural
invariant is necessary for anonymity.
1Such distributions might contain usage patterns, irregularities between
users and synchronization failures that the adversary can exploit.
2In some analyses, individual parameters may reduce with increasing η,
such as the bandwidth overhead per user, as the other parameters, such as the
number of users, increase.

Next, we propose an ideal protocol Πideal that is optimal in
terms of satisfying the invariant: The probability that Πideal
fulﬁlls the necessary invariant is at least as high as for any
protocol within our model (limited by the same constraints for
β and (cid:4)). Moreover, whenever Πideal satisﬁes the invariant, the
advantage of Apaths is zero. Thus, Πideal is at least as good
as any protocol within our model at winning against Apaths.
Finally, we calculate the advantage of Apaths against Πideal
to obtain a lower bound on the adversarial advantage against
all protocols within our model.3
C. Scenarios and Lower Bounds
We devise necessary constraints for four different scenarios.
Let Π be a protocol in our model, with N users, restricted by
bandwidth overhead β ∈ [0, 1] and latency overhead (cid:4) ≥ 0.
For the compromising cases, the adversary can compromise
c out of K protocol parties. We derive the following lower
bounds for δ-sender anonymity in the respective scenarios.

To keep the presentation concise, we focus on how to derive
bounds for sender anonymity. As the bounds for recipient
anonymity are obtained analogously, we only explain the
adjustments in the proofs and the corresponding resulting
bounds. The omitted canonical analysis can be found in [33].
D. Interpretation and Interesting Cases
Our ﬁrst and third lower bounds, for respectively synchro-
nized and unsynchronized user behaviors against in a non-
compromised AC network, suggest an anonymity trilemma.
Both lower bounds can be simpliﬁed under some natural
