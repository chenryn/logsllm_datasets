Abstract
The proliferation of personal wireless devices requires
secure connection between them. While it is easy to se-
curely pair electronic devices by wires, it is very challeng-
ing to pair them wirelessly when they have no prior asso-
ciation. We propose Good Neighbor, a novel scheme that
securely pairs nearby wireless devices by exploiting mul-
tiple antennas built in them. Our scheme requires neither
shared secrets nor out-of-band channels (e.g., audio, vi-
sual, keyboard, etc.) between the pairing devices. It only
requires that the receiver has multiple antennas and that
the sender can be placed nearby the receiver. Our scheme
is based on the propagation characteristic of the wireless
signal that the power of the received signal is inversely
proportional to some exponent of the distance between the
sender and receiver. When a nearby sender moves very
close to one antenna on the receiver, the receiver can ob-
serve a large difference between the signal strength mea-
sured on its two antennas, whereas a faraway sender would
be unable to induce such a large difference. We validate
our scheme through theoretical analysis and experimental
measurements. We discuss the factors that may affect our
scheme — including antenna gain, received signal strength
(RSS) saturation, dynamic rate adaptation, and multipath
effects — and how to mitigate them. Finally, we demon-
strate the practicality of our scheme by implementing and
evaluating a prototype.
1 Introduction
The proliferation of wireless devices requires secure
connection between these devices. However, how to set

up a secure connection between two previously unassoci-
ated devices remains an important yet challenging problem.
Most current schemes rely on a common secret to bootstrap
the secure connection. However, creating a strong secret
and delivering it to both devices often poses usability chal-
lenges. First, users are known not to be competent at cre-
ating strong secrets. Second, users have to go through dif-
ferent, and often laborious and unintuitive, procedures to
enter the secret on different devices. This mechanism be-
comes even more problematic for devices with no keyboard,
such as wireless headphones. In this case, manufacturers
often hardcode the secrets in the devices and print them in
the manuals. For usability reasons, manufacturers tend to
choose easy-to-remember secrets, such as 0000 for many
bluetooth headphones, which completely defeats the pur-
pose of shared secrets.
Moreover, we often need to set up ad hoc, temporary
connections between nearby devices. For example, two
business people wish to exchange contact information via
their cell phones, and a group of tourists wish to exchange
photos in their wireless-capable cameras. We can establish
such ad hoc connections between unassociated devices eas-
ily via wires, but to do so wirelessly is very challenging.
This problem is called Secure Device Paring.
The Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) [2] standard from Wi-
Fi Alliance speciﬁes four device pairing methods. (1) PBC
method: the user pushes a hardware or software button on
both devices; (2) PIN method: the user reads a PIN from
one device and enters it at the other; (3) NFC (Near Field
Communication) method: the user brings the devices close
enough to allow near ﬁeld communication between them
(such as RFID tags); (4) USB method: the user transfers
data between the devices using either a USB ﬂash drive or a
USB cable. Approaches proposed by researchers for secure
device pairing, including the above four methods, fall into
two categories: (1) based on out-of-band channels, and (2)
based on proximity.
Kobsa, et al. [10] compared device pairing schemes
based on out-of-band channels, such as acoustic [16, 6],
visual [14, 21], and motion [13, 8]. These schemes re-
quire either sensors — such as cameras, microphones, or
accelerometers – or peripherals, such as displays or key-
boards. As wireless capability is expanding to a wide va-
riety of devices (such as cameras, scanners, or even digital
picture frames) that do not have these sensors or peripher-
als, the scope of applicability of these schemes is limited.
Alternatively, device pairing can be based on proximity.
In many circumstances, the adversary cannot come close
to the user’s devices (or cannot do so without being de-
tected). Frank Stajano described many scenarios where the
user wishes to pair any devices within proximity [24]. Us-
ing a USB cable is a form of proximity-based pairing; how-
ever, since it requires a cable and USB interfaces on both de-
vices, its applicability is limited. The NFC method in WPS
is also a proximity-based method; however, it is vulnerable
to attacks using powerful transmitting and receiving anten-
nas. Distance bounding protocols [3, 4, 19] are resilient
to these attacks; however, since they require highly precise
clocks (of nanosecond precision) because electromagnetic
waves propagate over 30cm in 1 nanosecond, they are un-
suitable for many consumer wireless devices [20].
We propose a simple yet reliable proximity-based device
pairing scheme by taking advantage of multiple antennas
available on many modern wireless devices. Our scheme
only requires that one of the pairing devices has at least
two antennas (We call the device with multiple antennas
the receiver, and the other one the sender. If both devices
have multiple antennas, either one can serve as the receiver).
Our scheme requires neither shared secrets nor out-of-band
channels between the devices. Our key insight is that the
difference in the received signal strengths (RSS) on differ-
ent antennas on the receiver can indicate if the sender is
nearby. RSS is inversely proportional to some exponent of
the distance between the sender and the receiver. When the
user places the sender very close to one antenna on the re-
ceiver, the receiving signal strength on this antenna would
be far greater than that on the other antennas on the receiver.
By contrast, when the sender is far from the receiver, it is
of similar distance from all the antennas on the receiver
and therefore would be unable to cause a large difference
in the RSS values. Although a faraway attacker can attack
the NFC method by increasing its transmitting power, such
an attack has no effect on our method because transmitting
power does not affect the difﬁerence of RSS values between
different antennas on the receiver.
Since our scheme requires neither sensors nor peripher-
als, it can be applied to simple wireless devices like Eye-
Fi [1] cards. Our scheme requires that one of the pair-
ing devices has at least two antennas. Even though not
all the wireless devices have multiple antennas yet, we ex-
pect multiple antennas to become widely available soon as
wireless devices embrace the multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) technology proposed in IEEE 802.11n to increase
their maximum raw data rates.
Although multiple RSS values have been explored for
location inference [11, 25], we are the ﬁrst, to the best of
our knowledge, to apply it to secure device pairing. Since
device pairing requires a much more precise estimation of
proximity than the previous schemes, as the attacker may
come within a reasonable distance from the user’s wireless
device (e.g., at an airport lounge), we need to overcome a
series of challenges (Section 4) in designing our scheme.
2 Proximity detection based on differential
RSS
Compared to the difﬁculty in pairing wireless devices,
pairing wireline devices is often straightforward: by simply
plugging one device into the other. This approach is se-
cure against all adversaries that are physically distant from
the pairing devices. Due to the simplicity of this scheme,
one naturally wishes to ﬁnd a similar mechanism to securely
pair wireless devices that are in immediate proximity. As is
well known in wireless communication, the received signal
strength (RSS) depends on the distance between the sender
and receiver. A naive idea would be to infer proximity based
on the RSS value alone. However, a faraway attacker could
defeat this naive scheme by sending powerful signal to in-
duce large RSS values on the receiver
We can defeat the above attack if the receiver has two
antennas that can measure RSS independently. Most recent
laptops, including all the laptops with 802.11n MIMO mod-
ules, have two or more antennas to take advantage of an-
tenna diversity. Although not all mobile devices currently
have multiple antennas, we expect multiple antennas to ap-
pear on these devices soon as they embrace the MIMO tech-
nology to improve their data rate. Note that our scheme re-
quires only one of the two pairng device to have multiple
antennas (we call this device the receiver, and the other de-
vice the sender).
Our key observation is that the ratio between the RSS
values measured on the multiple antennas on the receiver
is independent of the sending power. However, the ratio
depends on the difference between the distances between
the sender and the two receiving antennas. While a nearby
sender can make this difference large, a faraway sender can-
not.
2.1 Theories of RSS
2.1.1 Free space propagation model
In the absence of any reﬂections or multipath, we can
model radio wave propagation using the free space propa-
gation model in Equation (1) [18]. The power of the signal
at the receiving antenna is:
Pr = PsGsGr(
λ
4πd
)2.
(1)
where Gr and Gs are the gains of the receiving and send-
ing antenna, respectively, Ps is the power at the surface of
the sending antenna, and d is the distance between the two
antennas.
When we represent Pr in dBm:
Pr[dBm] = P0 − 20log(
d
d0
).
(2)
where P0 is the power of the signal in dBm at distance d0
away from the sender.
2.1.2 Log-normal shadowing model
A more widely used signal propagation model is log-
normal shadowing [18].
Pr[dBm] = P0 − 10αlog(
d
d0
) + Xσ.
(3)
where P0 is the receiving power at distance d0, α is the path
loss exponent, and Xσ is a Gaussian noise (random variable)
with zero mean and standard deviation σ. The path loss ex-
ponent α depends on the speciﬁc propagation environment,
i.e., type of construction material, architecture, and location
within a building. The values of α range from 1.2 (Waveg-
uide effect) to 8 [15]. In free space, α is 2.
2.2 RSS ratio
Inferring distance by RSS alone is difﬁcult because of
the uncertainty of α and Xσ, especially in a dynamic en-
vironment. However, for device pairing, the inﬂuence from
the environment is small because the sender and the receiver
are close. We evaluate our hypothesis with a series of ex-
periments in Section 4.
The setting of our RSS based proximity inference
scheme is shown in Figure 1. The receiver R has two an-
tennas, A1 and A2, separated by a reasonable distance L.
When R receives a packet, R reads the RSS values (RSS1
and RSS2) independently on A1 and A2, respectively. Since
RSS is a value in dBm1, we term the difference between the
two RSS values, r = RSS1− RSS2, as RSS ratio.
1RSS is the ratio of the power of the received signal (P in mW ) to 1mW
in decibels, i.e., RSS = 10 log10(P).

Figure 1. Our scheme requires the receiver to
be a wireless device with at least two anten-
nas. We use a laptop equipped with 802.11n
MIMO antenna in our prototype system.
We assume that the RSS1 and RSS2 values follow the
Log-normal shadowing model. For clarity, we let RSS1
and RSS2 denote the average of sufﬁcient number of RSS
measurements so that Xσ can be removed. Therefore, the
RSS ratio r observed at the receiver is 10αlog( d2
). When
d1
the sender is placed close to A1, d1 is very small while
d2/d1 ≈ l/d1 is large, so r becomes a large positive value.
Similarly, when the sender is moved to A2, d2 decreases
and d2/d1 ≈ d2/l becomes very small, so r becomes a large
negative value.
When an attacker not in the proximity of the receiver
sends packets, the RSS ratio r observed at the receiver is
10αlog( d$2
). The largest value of |r| that the attacker can
d$1
incur is (d$1 + l)/d$1 where the attacker’s antenna is on the
same line of A1A2 and is closer to A1(or A2). When d$1 is
sufﬁciently larger than L, |r| is a small number. In other
words, a faraway attacker is unable to yield a large RSS
ratio no matter where the attacker is. Based on this obser-
vation, the receiver can choose appropriate thresholds rH
(when the sender is close to A1) and rL (when the sender is
close to A2) to distinguish a faraway attacker from a legiti-
mate nearby sender.
3 Design
3.1 Goal and threat model
Our goal is to build a practical, reliable scheme for se-
curely pairing nearby devices that have no prior association.
In this paper, we only consider one-way authentication, i.e.,
only the receiver authenticates the sender but not the other
way around. In many scenarios, only one-way authentica-
tion is necessary. For example, when a user wants to trans-
fer her personal ﬁles from the receiver (e.g. laptop) to the
sender (e.g. PDA), she only requires the receiver to authen-
ticate the sender. It is straightforward to extend this one-
way authentication into mutual authentication if the sender
also has multiple antennas.
Our scheme requires only that the legitimate sender be
physically close to the receiver. We wish to ensure that no
faraway malicious sender can be paired with the receiver
successfully. Our scheme can resist powerful attackers. For
example, the attacker may have arbitrarily high transmis-
sion power and can adjust the transmission power arbitrar-
ily; he may sniff all the trafﬁc between the two pairing wire-
less devices; he may have exact copies of the two pairing
devices and use the copies to attack our scheme; he may
know the exact location of the receiver and its antennas; he
may send his attack packets via line-of-sight propagation.
However, we exclude the following threats, as they are
out of the scope of this paper:
• Compromising either the receiver or a legitimate
sender, e.g., by malware infection.
• Jamming the wireless channel.
3.2 Basic scheme
Let the two antennas on the receiver R be A1 and A2.
When the user places the sender very close to the antenna
A1 on the receiver R, R expects to observe a large positive
RSS ratio (Section 2.2). Then, when the user moves the
sender very close to the antenna A2, R expects to observe
a large negative RSS. By contrast, if the sender is faraway
from the receiver, R cannot observe large absolute values of
the ratio.
Our scheme requires the sender to be placed close to both
the receiving antennas sequentially to reduce the probability
of the “walk-by” attack, where the attacker places his sender
very close to the receiver by walking by the receiver without
raising suspicion. However, it would be very difﬁcult for
the attacker to place his sender close to both the receiving
antennas sequentially during a an inconspicuous walk-by.
We checked the feasibility of this scheme on a laptop
with 802.11n MIMO antennas.2 We found that when S re-
peatedly sent packets to R, the RSS values (RSS1 and RSS2)
measured on R were not constant even when the distance
was ﬁxed.
Instead, they ﬂuctuated in a typical Gaussian
distribution consistent with Equation 3. To improve the re-
liability of our scheme, we let S send a sufﬁcient number
of packets when it is close to each antenna on R, and let R
calculate the mean of the RSS ratios of these packets. We
