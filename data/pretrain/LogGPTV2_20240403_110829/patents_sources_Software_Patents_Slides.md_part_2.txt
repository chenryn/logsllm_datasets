### Patentability and Nonobviousness

#### The Invention: A Case Study
This invention, however, was merely the combination of a glue (element A) with note-sized paper (element B). Both elements were known in the prior art. Evaluating the invention part by part might have rendered this patentable invention obvious. However, evaluating it "as a whole" shows that this new combination warranted an exclusive right.

#### Nonobviousness (Inventive Step)
- **Nonobvious to Whom?**
- **Challenges in Determining Nonobviousness**: Nonobviousness is difficult to determine.
- **Framework for Analyzing Obviousness**:
  - **Graham v. John Deere Co. (1966)**: This case established a framework for analyzing obviousness.
  - **The Problem of Hindsight Bias**: Obviousness determination may occur years after the invention, introducing subjectivity into the examination.
  - **Teaching-Suggestion-Motivation (TSM) Test**: The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) created the TSM test to carry out the Graham analysis. For a patent to be deemed obvious, there must be some suggestion or teaching in the prior art to combine the elements shown in the prior art.

#### KSR v. Teleflex
- **Case Overview**:
  - **Teleflex's Claim**: Teleflex claimed that KSR infringed on their patent.
  - **KSR's Argument**: KSR argued that the patent was obvious and therefore not valid.
  - **District Court Decision**: Favored KSR (Basis: §103).
  - **Appeals Court Decision**: Favored Teleflex (Basis: TSM).
  - **Supreme Court Decision**: Favored KSR (Basis: §103), stating that the TSM test is not the exclusive test for determining obviousness.
- **Key Points from the Supreme Court**:
  - **Flexibility in TSM Test**: The TSM test should not be applied rigidly or formalistically.
  - **Market Pressure as Motivation**: Market pressure can implicitly motivate the combination of familiar elements.
  - **Combination of Familiar Elements**: Combining familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious if it yields predictable results.
  - **Justice Kennedy's Insight**: "A person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton."

### Gottschalk v. Benson (1972)
- **Invention**: A method of converting signals from binary coded decimal (BCD) form into binary form.
- **Supreme Court Decision**:
  - **Abstract Principle**: The algorithm was considered an abstract principle and thus unpatentable.
  - **Congressional Role**: Congress should determine whether computer software should receive patent protection.
  - **Pre-emption Concerns**: Allowing the claims would pre-empt the underlying mathematical formula, effectively patenting the algorithm itself.

### Diamond v. Diehr (1981)
- **Invention**: A method for operating a rubber-molding press under control of a computer program.
- **Examiner's Rejection**: The only non-program steps were conventional and necessary, and the claims sought protection for a computer program, which was non-statutory.
- **Supreme Court Decision**:
  - **Practical Application**: The claimed method had a practical and definite application with a useful result (curing rubber).
  - **Statutory Subject Matter**: The method was directed to statutory subject matter because it was an industrial process historically eligible for patent protection.
  - **Computer Use**: The use of a programmed computer did not render the subject matter non-statutory.

### Patenting Algorithms
- **General Principles**:
  - **Abstract Algorithms**: Algorithms in the abstract are not patentable.
  - **Embedded Algorithms**: An algorithm embedded in a general-purpose computer becomes a patentable machine.
  - **Example**: US4464650: Apparatus and method for compressing data signals and restoring the compressed data signals.

### State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc. (1998)
- **Invention**: A programmed computer configured to calculate various output financial data based on input data.
- **District Court Decision**: Invalidated the patent as directed to non-statutory subject matter (abstract idea, mental process).
- **Federal Circuit Decision**:
  - **Useful, Concrete, and Tangible Result**: Mathematical formulas, equations, and algorithms are not statutory unless they produce a useful, concrete, and tangible result.
  - **Business Methods**: Software and business methods are patentable if they produce a useful, concrete, and tangible result.

### Bilski v. Kappos
- **Invention**: A method of hedging risk in trading commodities.
- **Examiner's Rejection**: Claims rejected under 35 USC §101.
- **Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) Decision**:
  - **Transformation Test**: Claims failed the transformation test.
  - **Abstract Ideas**: Claims were considered abstract ideas.
- **Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) Decision**:
  - **Machine or Transformation Test**: Ruled that the machine-or-transformation test is the governing test.
  - **Insufficient Criteria**: Producing useful, concrete, and tangible results is insufficient.
- **Supreme Court Decision**:
  - **Rejection of Categorical Exclusions**: Rejected calls to categorically exclude business methods from patent law.
  - **Rejection of Sole Test**: Rejected the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test of subject matter eligibility.
  - **Lack of Guidance**: Did not provide additional guidance or a clear explanation for why Bilski’s invention was unpatentable.

### European Patent Convention (EPC) Art. 52
- **Patent Eligibility**:
  - **Art. 52(1)**: European patents shall be granted for any inventions in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are susceptible of industrial application.
  - **Art. 52(2)**: Excludes discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules, and methods for performing mental acts, playing games, doing business, and programs for computers.
  - **Art. 52(3)**: Exclusions apply only to the extent that the application or patent relates to such subject-matter or activities as such.

### Technical Character
- **European Patent Office (EPO) Guidelines**:
  - **Technical Field**: The invention must relate to a technical field, address a technical problem, and have technical features.
  - **Computer Programs**: If the claimed subject-matter has a technical character, it is not excluded from patentability.
  - **Boards of Appeal (BOA)**: An invention must have a technical character. Examples include processing physical data and controlling industrial processes.
  - **Claim Analysis**: Look at the claim as a whole and assess whether it has technical character. If one feature is technical, the whole claim is technical.

### Key Cases
- **Vicom T208/84**: Computerized process for digitally enhancing images using a mathematical method (digital filter). The technical contribution was a graphic display resulting from the algorithm.
- **Pension Benefit Systems Partnership T931/95 [2001]**: The patent involved a business method.
