This invention, however, was merely the combination
of a glue (element A) with note-sized paper (element
B). Both elements were in the prior art.
–
Evaluating the invention part by part might have
rendered this patentable invention obvious.
Evaluating it "as a whole" shows that this new
combination warranted an exclusive right.
28
Nonobviousness (Inventive Step)
•
Nonobvious to whom?
•
Nonobviousness is difficult to determine
•
Framework for analyzing obviousness
–
Graham v. John Deere Co. (1966)
•
The problem of Hindsight bias
–
Obviousness determination may occur years after the
invention. This brings subjectivity into the examination.
•
Teaching-suggestion-motivation (TSM) test
–
CAFC created TSM to carry out the Graham analysis.
–
Must be some suggestion or teaching in the prior art to
combine elements shown in the prior art in order to find a
patent obvious .
29
KSR v. Telefax
•
Teleflex claims KSR infringed on their patent
•
KSR argued that it is not patentable because it
is obvious
•
DISTRICT COURT: Favor KSR (Basis: §103)
•
APPEALS COURT: Favor Teleflex (Basis: TSM)
•
SUPREME COURT: Favor KSR (Basis: §103)
TSM is not the exclusive test.
30
Supreme Court in KSR
•
TSM is not to be employed in a rigid or formalistic manner.
–
Motivation could be found implicitly when it is obvious to try.
–
Electrical sensors are becoming a norm over mechanical
connections in everything, so market pressure dictated that KSR
putting a sensor on the pedal is obvious.
–
Combination of familiar elements according to known methods
is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield
predictable results.
•
TSM test sets the patentability bar too low.
–
Allows too many trivial inventions to receive patent protection.
•
Justice Kennedy: “A person of ordinary skill is also a person of
ordinary creativity, not an automaton.”

Summary
32
Gottschalk v. Benson (1972)
•
A method of converting signals from binary
coded decimal (BCD) form into binary form.
•
The supreme court considered the algorithm as
an abstract principle and therefore unpatentable.
•
Supreme Court Decision (1972)
–
Congress to determine whether computer software
should receive patent protection.
–
Allowing the claims would wholly pre-empt the
underlying mathematical formula and in practical
effect would amount to a patent on the algorithm
itself.
33
Diamond v. Diehr
•
A method for operating a rubber-molding
press under control of a computer program.
•
The examiner:
–
the only non-program steps recited in the claims
were "conventional and necessary to the process
and cannot be the basis of patentability."
–
the claims sought protection of a computer
program and were therefore directed to non-
statutory subject matter.
34
Diamond v. Diehr (S.Ct. 1981)
•
Claim must be directed to practical and definite
application with a useful result (cure rubber).
•
A Claimed method for operating a rubber-molding
press is directed to statutory subject matter since the
claims are directed to an industrial process of the
type that has historically been eligible for patent
protection.
•
The fact that it uses a programmed computer as a
part of the process to operate the press does not
render the subject matter non-statutory.
35
Patenting Algorithms
•
Algorithms in the abstract are not patentable
•
An algorithm embedded in a general purpose
computer becomes a patentable machine
[In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1994)]
•
An example:
•
We found that claim … does not seek to patent its
mathematical algorithm in the abstract and is
instead directed to a particular machine
implementation of the mathematical algorithm.

State Street Bank & Trust Co.
v. Signature Financial Group, Inc. (1998)
•
Seminal court case on the eligibility of "business
methods“ under 35 U.S.C. §101.
•
Claimed a programmed computer configured to
calculate various output financial data based on input
data.
•
No "business method" exception under 35 U.S.C. §101.
•
The patent had been held invalid by the District Court
as directed to non-statutory subject matter.
–
an abstract idea, mental process
38
State Street Bank & Trust Co.
v. Signature Financial Group, Inc.
•
Federal Circuit:
–
Mathematical formulas, equations, and algorithms
are not statutory subject matter unless applied in
some manner by the claimed invention to produce
"a useful, concrete, and tangible result.“
Software and business methods are
patentable if the invention produced a
“useful, concrete, and tangible result”
39
State Street Bank
•
"[T]he transformation of data, representing
discrete dollar amounts, by a machine through
a series of mathematical calculations into a
final share price, constitutes a practical
application of a mathematical algorithm,
formula, or calculation" because the final
share price produced is "a useful, concrete,
and tangible result."
•
Statutory subject matter determinations
involving methods utilized in business should
be analyzed like any other process claims and
not on whether the claimed subject matter
does "business“.

•
Summary
41
Bilski’s Patent
•
A method of hedging risk in trading commodities.
–
Claims not limited to operation on a computer.
–
One could think his method is yielding a useful,
concrete tangible result.
•
Examiner rejected the claims under 35 USC §101.
•
BPAI affirmed the rejection:
–
Claims fail the “transformation” test.
–
Claims are “abstract ideas”
–
Not a “practical application” or “concrete and
tangible result” under State Street.
•
“non-machine implemented” methods.
In re Bilski (2008)
•
CAFC (en banc) ruled that Bilski’s method was
unpatentable under a new rule called:
machine or transformation test.
•
“At present, and certainly for the present case, we
… reaffirm that the machine-or-transformation
test, properly applied, is the governing test”
•
Producing useful, concrete and tangible results is
insufficient.
43
Machine or Transformation Test
•
A claimed process is patent eligible under §101 if
(1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or
(2) it transforms a particular article into a different
state or thing.
–
What is a particular machine?
–
Will Bilski’s hedging method becomes patentable
if he adds a computer?
–
What transformations will qualify? - Historically a
“process” involved physical transformation of
tangible materials, as in a chemical process.
44
U.S. Supreme Court Decision
Bilski v. Kappos
•
Rejected calls to categorically exclude business
methods – or any technology – from the scope of
patent law.
•
Rejected as the sole test of subject matter
eligibility the “machine or transformation” test.
•
Did not provide important additional guidance
•
Did not provide a good explanation why Bilski’s
invention was unpatentable

Summary
46
European Patent Convention (EPC) Art. 52
•
52(1): European patents shall be
granted for any inventions, in all
fields of technology, provided that
they are new, involve an inventive
step and are susceptible of industrial
application.
47
EPC Art. 52
•
52(2): The following in particular shall not be
regarded as inventions within the meaning of
paragraph 1:
–
a) discoveries, scientific theories and
mathematical methods;
–
b) aesthetic creations;
–
c) schemes, rules and method for performing
mental acts, playing games or doing business, and
program for computers;
–
d) presentation of information.
48
EPC Art. 52
•
52(3): Paragraph 2 shall exclude the
patentability of the subject-matter or
activities referred to therein only to
the extent to which a European patent
application or European patent relates
to such subject-matter or activities as
such.
49
Technical Character
•
The European Patent Office (EPO) first tests
“technical character”. Then, novelty and
inventive step.
•
Guidelines for examination in the EPO
–
… the invention must be of "technical character" to
the extent that it must relate to a technical field
(Rule 42(1)(a)), must be concerned with a technical
problem (Rule 42(1)(c)), and must have technical
features in terms of which the matter for which
protection is sought can be defined in the claim
(Rule 43(1)) (see F-IV, 2.1).
50
Technical Character
•
Guidelines for examination in the EPO
–
The basic patentability considerations in respect of
claims for computer programs are in principle the
same as for other subject-matter. While "programs
for computers" are included among the items listed
in Art. 52(2), if the claimed subject-matter has a
technical character it is not excluded from
patentability by the provisions of Art. 52(2) and
Art. 52(3).
51
Technical Character
•
According to the Boards of Appeal (BOA)
•
An Invention must have a technical character.
•
Technical has no definition (intentionally).
Instead we have examples given by the BOA:
–
Processing physical data controlling industrial
processes is technical.
–
Sales methods and Mathematical methods are
non technical.
52
Technical Character
•
Look at the claim as a whole and ask whether it
does have technical character.
–
A machine, an article of manufacture, a process of
operating a machine, are clearly of a technical nature.
–
If one feature of a claim has technical character, then
the whole claim has technical character.
–
What characterizes a non-invention is its lack of
technical character [T 258/03 (HITACHI)].
–
Any invention having a technical character would not
be excluded. Then, the invention would have to satisfy
the requirements of being novel and inventive step.
53
Vicom T208/84
•
Vicom T208/84 – computerized process for
digitally enhancing images, which employ a
particular mathematical method [a digital filter].
•
The technical contribution was a graphic display
resulting from an algorithm.
•
In the early 1990s, the EPO would typically
employ the technical contribution approach.
•
The EPO would assess the contribution that the
claimed invention made to the (closest) prior art
and determine whether this contribution had
technical character.
