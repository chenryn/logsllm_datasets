of 40%, 50%, and 60% threshold values and quantify the
ratio between the customers’ costs based on the Aggregate-
Peak-Device and the Shapley policies (Table 9). Similar
to the time intervals, the impact of the network upgrade
policy is modest. The median ratio of the costs increases
only by 0.1 if the upgrade threshold is increased from 40%
to 60%.
Summary and implications: Neither the time-intervals,
over which we aggregate the traﬃc of the customers, nor
the upgrade policy, which is determined by the utilization
level when the capacity of a device is upgraded, have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on the discrepancies between the diﬀerent
cost-sharing policies.
5.6 Costs in different type of customers
We next dive deeper into the costs and focus on the diﬀer-
ent types of the customers present in our datasets. In Fig. 12
we depict the cost per Mbps and the peak data rate for all
customers classiﬁed into six diﬀerent types: content ISPs,
tier 1/2 ISPs, and EU, Latin American, US and Asian access
providers. We consider the network-level costs quantiﬁed
based on the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy. The ﬁgure re-
veals the following three main properties of the costs. First,
the cost per Mbps of individual customers covers a wide
range of several orders of magnitude. Second, even within a
single type of customer, one can expect large variability of
cost per Mbps though there is a tendency for lower costs for
the EU/US ISPs, compared to the LatAM and Asian ones.
This is a consequence of the fact that the EU/US ISPs send
most of their traﬃc to EU/US and thus utilize lower-cost
infrastructure. Finally, content providers fall consistently
in the range of ‘expensive’ customers (over 10$ per Mbps)
in terms of the cost per Mbps served. This indicates that
a large fraction of their traﬃc crosses expensive interconti-
nental links. We were able to justify this assumption based
raw data in our datasets.
6. RELATED WORK
We refer to the textbook of Courcoubetis and Weber [8]
for a thorough treatment of pricing in communication net-
works. A workshop version preceded this work [14] where
we focused on the diﬀerent cost-sharing policies that can be
applied in backbone networks. Our current work extends
that preliminary work with the following: a) we propose a
methodology for cost-sharing in backbone networks and in-
troduce the diﬀerent types of discrepancies; b) we evaluate
the liability facet of the cost-sharing domain; and c) we uti-
lize a much richer dataset that describes the traﬃc patterns
of a backbone network with three-times more links.
Several studies investigated how to reduce the transit costs
including ISP peering [2, 11, 10], CDNs [24], P2P localiza-
tion [6], and traﬃc smoothing [20]. Dimitropoulos et al. [12]
presented a comprehensive analysis of the 95th percentile
pricing. A proposal by Laoutaris et al. [16, 15] showed how
traﬃc can be transferred in the network without increasing
the 95th percentile of the customers. A recent proposal by
Stanojevic et al. [27] proposes to the customers of transit
providers to form a coalition to reduce their transit costs.
Valancius et al. [30] show that a small number of pricing
tiers are enough to extract close-to-optimal eﬃciency in the
transit provider. In our work we augment the price eﬃciency
analysis of [30] with a methodology that quantiﬁes how indi-
vidual customers aﬀect the cost of running the network that
demonstrate the complex nature of the customers’ costs in
the real-world networks.
Motiwala [21] et al. developed a cost model that operators
can use to evaluate the costs of their routing and peering
decisions. Their study is complementary to ours, as we can
use their model to assess the CAPEX and OPEX cost of the
network instead of using our step function (Section 3). A
diﬀerence is that we primarily focus on how the cost can be
more fairly and accurately distributed among the customers
of an operator.
The net neutrality debate is in many ways related to the
question of who is responsible for the costs in the network [7],
and our work contributes towards better understanding of
such costs.
Due to the desirable fairness properties [1, 13, 22] of the
Shapley value [25], recent studies proposed pricing and cost
sharing mechanisms using Shapley values. Briscoe [3, 4]
motivates the usage of mechanisms that share the costs of
the users fairly as a way to reduce widely known cross-
subsidization3 of the common infrastructure that often hap-
pens in the communication networks [5]. Cooperative ap-
proaches for cost sharing are investigated in case of inter-
domain routing [19, 26] and IP multicast [1, 13]. Ma et
al. [17, 18] presented a fair revenue sharing method for ISPs
that quantiﬁes the importance of each ISP in the Internet
ecosystem. The work of Stanojevic et al. [28] is the closest to
ours. The authors empirically investigated the temporal us-
age eﬀects using the Shapley and the 95Percentile-Customer
method. This work is diﬀerent in several ways: a) we focus
on the costs of the large customers of a backbone network
with geographically diverse links; b) we study additional cost

520sharing policies and aspects such as liability and TCO; and
c) we study a more detailed cost and traﬃc dataset.
7. CONCLUSIONS
With the increasing traﬃc volumes, intense market com-
petition, and technological barriers, most commercial back-
bone operators are faced with the challenge of maintain-
ing healthy proﬁt margins. Providing services to their cus-
tomers, which are often ISPs themselves, carries signiﬁcant
maintenance and upgrade costs. Attributing these costs to
individual customers is critical for ensuring smooth opera-
tions of the backbone network as well as oﬀering fair tar-
iﬀs to customers. However, the process of quantifying the
cost contribution of customers in a distributed backbone net-
work is far from simple involving the complex interaction of
many factors ranging from temporal/spatial characteristics
of the customers and non-linear cost-capacity relationships
to measurement infrastructure issues and high variability of
the component costs.
In this paper, we make a step towards understanding the
relationship between several cost-sharing policies and how
they aﬀect the individual customers. While our analysis re-
veals several important properties of the backbone network
cost-sharing, there are many questions that remain open.
For example, how can one utilize the global view of cost al-
location per customer to create simple yet proﬁtable tariﬀs?
Based on our ﬁndings, such tariﬀs should include device-
level expenditures and measurements to assure its accuracy.
Another open research question is how tariﬀs inspired by
the presented cost sharing policies would alter the behav-
ior of the customers, i.e., their traﬃc patterns to minimize
their expenditures. Additionally, it would be interesting to
study if our observed properties of the cost-sharing could be
mapped to other types of networks that are spatially less
diverse but serve a more populous customer base, such as
the residential broadband or 3G access networks.
