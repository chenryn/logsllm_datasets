User: Can you make a universal python application that will run on both OSX and Windows? With the same menu system, etc? Or would you need to make different versions for each OS?
Assistant: I have built several cross platform applications (Windows / OS X) with wxPython. Practically all of the code translates flawlessly across the two platforms. To put into context, I usually develop the applications on Mac OS side, and if I spend let's say one week hammering out an application, I spend something like a few hours to get it running nicely in Windows.
Usually those hours consist of:

Tweaking minor wxPython visuals (font sizes, colors)
Making nice things like embedded icons
Keyboard shortcuts (CMD vs CTRL)
Main menu

Like you correctly point out, if you want identical main menus you have some work ahead of you on OS X side. I myself have never really bothered, I am fine with having some additional OS X default main menu bits and pieces.
The main menu thing aside though, considering how little tweaking you have to do, I'd say wxPython is the way to go. Together with px2exe on Windows side and py2app on OS X side it packs quite the punch.
