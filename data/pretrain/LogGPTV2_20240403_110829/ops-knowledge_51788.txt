User: I've uploaded my .html chat file on my Ubuntu VPS, all that remains is to execute/run the python script pywebsock.py which will run the python server. I've uploaded the pywebsock.py to /bin/www and now I want to run it but I have no idea where to start.
When I run the pywebsock.py on my desktop it opens up a terminal saying "waiting connection". 
This is what I've done so far to try and run it:

Downloaded Putty
Downloaded WinSCP
Installed version of Python according to .py (2.7)

Any ideas?
Assistant: Running a script on the server is the same as running locally.
python script.py
You may check if you have python installed first using which python (should return the python location)
If not, get it using sudo apt-get install python
after that, go to www directory and run it.
