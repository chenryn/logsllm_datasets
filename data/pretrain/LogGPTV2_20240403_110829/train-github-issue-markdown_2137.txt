**Context:**
- Playwright Version: 1.19

**Describe the Bug**

In the provided Page Object Model (POM) demonstration example, the visibility check for an element is duplicated, which can be misleading in a POM context. The documentation needs to be updated to reflect the correct usage.

**Expected Behavior**

The visibility check should use the already defined `this.coreConceptsLink` locator within the `PlaywrightDevPage` constructor:

```javascript
await expect(this.coreConceptsLink).toBeVisible();
```

Where `this.coreConceptsLink` is defined as:

```javascript
this.coreConceptsLink = page.locator('text=Core concepts');
```

**Actual Behavior**

The current implementation in the documentation duplicates the locator and uses a different approach:

```javascript
await expect(this.page.locator('h1').locator("text=Core concepts")).toBeVisible();
```

**Additional Details**

This inconsistency can cause confusion for developers who are following the POM pattern. It is important to ensure that the documentation aligns with best practices and avoids redundancy.

**Suggested Update**

Update the documentation at [https://playwright.dev/docs/test-pom](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-pom) to use the `this.coreConceptsLink` locator for the visibility check, as shown in the expected behavior section.
