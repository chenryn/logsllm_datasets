**To the Python Community:**

I am in search of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) version of IDLE, the Python GUI. So far, I have only been able to find versions for Windows and Mac. I need this tool to test and develop an API that will integrate with HTTP.

**Response:**

IDLE is included in the `python-tools` package.
