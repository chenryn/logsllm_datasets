## Expected Behavior
The custom-server-typescript example should work as expected on next.js 5.1.0.
All routes should resolve to their respective pages in the pages/ folder.
## Current Behavior
The custom-server-typescript example's routes all return 404 on next.js 5.1.0
but work fine on 5.0.0
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. clone the custom-server-typescript example
  2. follow steps to install dependencies and run example
  3. navigate to the index, a or b routes
  4. all routes return 404 instead of their respective pages
  5. downgrade next.js to 5.0.0 (eg. npm install next@5.0.0 --save)
  6. rerun the example (eg. npm run dev)
  7. navigate to the index, a and b routes and they work as expected
