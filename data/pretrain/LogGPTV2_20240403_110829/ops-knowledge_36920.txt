User: The situation:
I have a python script to connect/send signals to serial connected arduino's. I wanted to know the best way to implement a web server, so that i can query the status of the arduinos. I want that both the "web server" part and serial connection runs on the same script. Is it possible, or do i have to break it into a daemon and a server part?
Thanks, any comments are the most welcomed.
Assistant: For those wondering what I have opted for; I have decoupled the two part:
The Arduino daemon
I am using Python with a micro web framework called [Bottle][1] which handles the API calls and I have used PySerial to communicate with the Arduino's. 
The web server
The canonical Apache and PHP; are used to make API calls to the Arduino daemon.
