User: I've tried pretty much everything on stackoverflow and other forums to get the /usr/include/ folder on my mac (currently using OS X 10.9.5)

Re-installed Xcode and command line tools (actually, command line tool wasn't one of the downloads available - so I'm guessing it's was already downloaded)
tried /Applications/Install Xcode.app command line on terminal

I haven't tested if there is no standard library on Xcode, but I'm only trying to build cloudera/hue from github and it won't install because there is no /usr/include/python2.7 (and couldn't really ask their forum because the error isn't coming from cloudera/hue).
How do I get the /usr/include folder?
Assistant: Try on 10.14:
sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /
