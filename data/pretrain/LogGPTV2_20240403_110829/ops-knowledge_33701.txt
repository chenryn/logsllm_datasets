User: How to configure SSH service in Linux system to improve security and restrict remote access?
Assistant: 1. Disable the SSH remote login of the root user: Find the PermitRootLogin item in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and set it to "no". 2. Use SSH keys: use SSH keys instead of passwords for authentication. You can generate a key pair locally and configure the public key on the server side. 3. Prohibit the use of non-secure protocols and weak encryption algorithms: Set the Ciphers and MACs parameters in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to control the use of encryption algorithms, and prohibit the use of weak encryption algorithms such as DES. 4. Disable unnecessary SSH sessions: Set the MaxSessions parameter to limit the number of simultaneous SSH sessions. 5. Change the SSH service port: modify the default port 22, and use other ports to strengthen the SSH service. 6. Use authentication authorization: Set the SSH user authentication method to be based on public key, password or a combination of both to restrict remote access. 7. Configure iptables rules: Enable iptables service and limit the source IP address and port of SSH access. Tools such as fail2ban can also be used to prevent attacks such as brute force cracking. 8. Regularly update and maintain the SSH service: Regularly update the SSH service and delete useless SSH keys and users to avoid security risks.
