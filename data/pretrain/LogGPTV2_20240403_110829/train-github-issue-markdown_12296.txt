I'm in a LAN, with last windows build from
http://atom.someguy123.com/#sthash.eU1lJdcA.dpbs
System is a Windows7 x64.
If I open a local file (desktop for example) loads correctly the file.  
If I open a remote file (on the private network \172.28.26.*) treeview sees
all the files and folders, when I click on a file it opens a tab but doesn't
load any text (blank)  
If I map the remote folder ad a network drive (on I:/) and I open the same
directory, files load correctly.
