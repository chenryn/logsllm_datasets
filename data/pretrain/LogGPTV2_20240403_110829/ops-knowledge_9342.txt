User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Observe the following logs
 0 19:55:01,647 INFO Closed socket connection for client /10.10.34.13:54294 (no session established for client)
 1 17:13:23,515 INFO Closed socket connection for client /10.10.34.12:36401 (no session established for client)

 3 19:53:54,912 INFO Closed socket connection for client /10.10.34.13:54265 (no session established for client)
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error = 和 Interrupting SendWorker
B: Closed socket connection for client /<*>:<*> (no session established for client) 和 My election bind port: <*>/<*>:<*>
