## Abstract

The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) safeguards users from malicious man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by having trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) vouch for domain names through digitally signed certificates. However, the mechanism CAs use to issue these certificates is itself vulnerable to MITM attacks by network-level adversaries. Autonomous Systems (ASes) can exploit vulnerabilities in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to hijack traffic destined for a victim's domain.

In this paper, we rigorously analyze the attacks that an adversary can use to obtain a fraudulent certificate. We perform the first real-world demonstration of BGP attacks to ethically obtain fraudulent certificates from top CAs. To assess the vulnerability of the PKI, we collected a dataset of 1.8 million certificates and found that an adversary could potentially gain a fraudulent certificate for the vast majority of domains. Finally, we propose and evaluate two countermeasures to secure the PKI:
1. CAs verifying domains from multiple vantage points to make it harder to launch a successful attack.
2. A BGP monitoring system for CAs to detect suspicious BGP routes and delay certificate issuance, giving network operators time to react to BGP attacks.

## 1. Introduction

Digital certificates serve as the foundation of trust in encrypted communication. When a CA is asked to sign a certificate, it must verify that the requesting client is the legitimate owner of the domain name. An adversary with a trusted certificate can impersonate the victim's domain and intercept or modify sensitive HTTPS traffic, such as bank logins and credit card information [24].

The process used by CAs to verify domain ownership, known as domain control verification, is critical to preventing adversaries from obtaining trusted certificates for domains they do not control. This verification is performed through standardized methods, including HTTP-based and email-based verification [18].

Recent research has exposed several flaws in existing domain control verification mechanisms. For example, WoSign was found issuing certificates to users who could demonstrate control of any TCP port at a domain, rather than strictly requiring control of traditional mail, HTTP, and TLS ports [3]. Additionally, researchers have found instances of CAs sending domain control verification requests to ordinary user email addresses instead of bona fide administrators [1]. In response, countermeasures are being developed, such as standardizing which URLs on a domain’s web server can be used to verify control [11].

While these advances can defend against some attacks, they do not address the threat posed by network-level adversaries, such as ASes, that can manipulate BGP. Such adversaries can launch active BGP hijack and interception attacks to steal traffic from victims or CAs and spoof the domain control verification process to obtain fraudulent certificates.

In this paper, we first analyze and compare BGP attacks on the domain verification process, developing a taxonomy and presenting a highly effective use of the "AS-path poisoning" attack originally described in [39]. Next, we conduct all BGP attacks against our own domain and decrypt seemingly "secure" HTTPS traffic within seconds. To avoid harming real users, these attacks were conducted ethically on domains that resolved to our own IP prefix and were registered solely for the experiments. We then quantify the vulnerability of domain verification to these attacks. Finally, we propose countermeasures against these attacks. Our main contributions are as follows:

- **Active BGP Attacks on Domain Verification Process:** We performed five types of real-world BGP attacks during the domain verification process: 1) a traditional BGP sub-prefix attack, 2) a traditional BGP equally-specific-prefix attack, 3) a prepended BGP sub-prefix attack, 4) a prepended BGP equally-specific-prefix attack, and 5) a BGP AS-path poisoning attack. We are the first to demonstrate the use of prepended and AS-path poisoning attacks on the PKI and the first to perform any of these attacks during the domain verification process in the wild. We successfully obtained fraudulent certificates from all of the top five CAs (Let’s Encrypt, GoDaddy, Comodo, Symantec, GlobalSign) [8] in our real-world attacks. Our results were a major factor in Let’s Encrypt’s decision to start deploying the multiple-vantage-point countermeasure [37].

- **Quantify Vulnerability of Domains:** We collected a dataset of 1.8 million certificates from Google’s Certificate Transparency project logs [32] and studied the domains requesting those certificates. By observing the number of domains run out of IP prefixes shorter than 24 bits long (/24), we found that 72% of the domains were vulnerable to BGP sub-prefix hijack attacks and BGP AS-path poisoning attacks, which could allow any AS to get a certificate for these domains. Furthermore, the domains were vulnerable to BGP equally-specific-prefix attacks from an average of 70% of ASes.

- **Countermeasures against BGP Attacks:** We proposed and developed two countermeasures to mitigate the threat of BGP attacks: multiple vantage point verification and a live BGP monitoring system.
  - **Multiple Vantage Point Verification:** We propose performing domain control verification from multiple locations on the Internet (vantage points) to prevent localized BGP attacks. We calculate the best locations for vantage points and quantify the resulting security benefit.
  - **Live BGP Monitoring System:** We design and implement (in Let’s Encrypt’s CA) a monitoring system with a novel route age heuristic to prevent short-lived BGP attacks [19] that can quickly lead to a fraudulent certificate before the attack is noticed. Our heuristic is designed for CAs and forces adversaries to keep attacks active for several hours, giving network operators time to react.

Some of the BGP attacks were briefly discussed in a short abstract [16]. In this paper, we go further by analyzing the complete attack surface of BGP attacks on PKI and performing all the attacks in the wild—successfully. We also measure the vulnerability of the current PKI to these attacks and propose and evaluate two effective countermeasures to defend against them.

## 2. BGP Attacks on the PKI

### 2.1. Adversary Model

**Adversary Objectives:**
We consider an adversary aiming to obtain a fraudulent certificate for a victim’s domain and then decrypt sensitive TLS traffic for as long as possible without being detected. The slower a defense system detects a BGP attack, the more effective the MITM attack is. Because intercepting a TLS stream can cause significant damage in a couple of hours [24], detection systems that require manual investigation or have a significant delay are not effective. However, the adversary is incentivized to avoid major reachability problems (which would alert the victim) and highly suspicious BGP announcements that might get automatically filtered or immediately trigger alerts. Given this model, we aim to assess the current degree of vulnerability of the PKI.

**Realistic Constraints on Adversary Capabilities:**
An adversary must compromise an AS’s border router or control an AS to launch the attack. Assuming the adversarial AS and victim’s domain are fixed, several variables are beyond the adversary’s control, such as the topological relationship between the adversary, the victim, and the CA, and the benign BGP announcement for the IP prefix that includes the victim’s domain.

Despite these constraints, we assume adversaries can control exactly what BGP announcement they make and which neighboring ASes they make this announcement to. We also assume an adversary is capable of generating traffic with a source IP address that belongs to the victim. Studies show that a significant portion of ASes still allows source IP spoofing [2, 34] due to a lack of ingress filtering. Even a strictly filtered adversary can spoof packets by gaining control of a client in one of these networks that allow spoofing and use it to spoof packets on behalf of the adversary.

Another variable the adversary can control is which IP address to attack. The adversary can directly target the IP address of the victim’s domain or the IP address of any DNS server involved in resolving the victim’s domain to give a fraudulent DNS response to the CA. This will cause the CA to request the verification webpage from the adversary instead of the victim.

Additionally, it is possible for the adversary to attack a CA’s IP address. The adversary can intercept the response of the victim (or a DNS server used to resolve the victim’s IP) to the CA, modify it to contain the document specified by the CA (or an incorrect DNS response), and forward it to the CA. By man-in-the-middling the responses from the victim’s domain or DNS servers, the adversary can fool the domain control verification process. These additional IP addresses an adversary can attack increase the attack surface.

**BGP Attack Properties:**
For an attack to be effective, it must have two properties: viability and stealthiness. Viability is a binary indication of whether the adversary is capable of launching the attack. Stealthiness is determined by several properties grouped into two categories:
1. **Control-plane stealthiness:** Measured through the properties of a BGP announcement like the IP prefix announced and the AS path.
2. **Data-plane stealthiness:** Measured through the number of ASes whose connectivity to a victim’s domain is disrupted during an attack.

### 2.2. Taxonomy of BGP Attacks

We present the details of the following five attacks and discuss the tradeoff between attack stealthiness and viability for each attack:
- **Traditional sub-prefix attack:** An adversary makes a BGP announcement originating a more-specific IP prefix than the victim’s prefix.
- **Traditional equally-specific-prefix attack:** An adversary announces an equal-length prefix as the victim’s prefix.
- **Prepended sub-prefix attack:** An adversary claims reachability to a more-specific IP prefix via a non-existent connection to the victim.
- **Prepended equally-specific-prefix attack:** An adversary claims reachability to the victim’s prefix via a non-existent connection.
- **AS-path poisoning attack:** An adversary announces a valid route to a more-specific prefix than the victim’s prefix to intercept Internet traffic en route to the victim.

Figure 2 illustrates the effects of these BGP attacks on Internet routing, and we summarize the unique properties and implementation details of these BGP attacks in the following sections.
