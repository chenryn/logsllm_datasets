Implications of Autonomy for the Expressiveness
of Policy Routing
Nick Feamster, Ramesh Johari, Member, IEEE, and Hari Balakrishnan
Abstract—Thousands of competing autonomous systems must
cooperate with each other to provide global Internet connectivity.
Each autonomous system (AS) encodes various economic, busi-
ness, and performance decisions in its routing policy. The current
interdomain routing system enables each AS to express policy
using rankings that determine how each router in the AS chooses
among different routes to a destination, and ﬁlters that determine
which routes are hidden from each neighboring AS. Because the
Internet is composed of many independent, competing networks,
the interdomain routing system should provide autonomy, allowing
network operators to set their rankings independently, and to
have no constraints on allowed ﬁlters. This paper studies routing
protocol stability under these conditions. We ﬁrst demonstrate
that “next-hop rankings,” commonly used in practice, may not
ensure routing stability. We then prove that, when providers
can set rankings and ﬁlters autonomously, guaranteeing that the
routing system will converge to a stable path assignment imposes
strong restrictions on the rankings ASes are allowed to choose.
We discuss the implications of these results for the future of
interdomain routing.

I. INTRODUCTION
I N Internet routing, independently operated autonomous sys-
tems (ASes) must cooperate to exchange global information;
nevertheless, this cooperation occurs in a landscape where these
independent networks compete to provide Internet service. BGP
facilitates this “competitive cooperation” by enabling network
operators to express routing policies that are consistent with de-
sired economic, business, and performance goals.
Ranking and ﬁltering are the two main mechanisms that oper-
ators use to implement their policies. Ranking determines which
of many possible routes to a destination should be used, thus
providing an AS the ﬂexibility to specify preferences over mul-
tiple candidate paths to a destination (e.g., specifying a primary

Instability can arise when each AS independently speciﬁes rankings

and a backup path). Filtering allows an AS to selectively adver-
tise routes to some ASes and hide routes from others, thereby
controlling which neighboring ASes send trafﬁc over its infra-
structure.
There are two important characteristics of policy routing: au-
tonomy and expressiveness. Autonomy is the ability of each AS
to set its rankings and ﬁlters independent of the others. Expres-
siveness refers to the ﬂexibility that the routing protocol pro-
vides an operator for specifying rankings and ﬁlters. Ranking
expressiveness determines what classes of rankings over routes
are permitted by the protocol, while ﬁltering expressiveness de-
termines the range of route ﬁlters that are allowed.
The combination of expressiveness and autonomy has, in
large part, been the reason for the success of BGP over the
past decade. We contend that both autonomy and ﬁltering
expressiveness will be requirements for policy routing for the
foreseeable future. Previous studies of routing stability assume
that ASes are willing to compromise some degree of autonomy,
ﬁltering expressiveness, or both (see Section II). Autonomy,
however, preserves each AS’s ability to set its policies without
coordinating with any other AS. Filtering expressiveness gives
an AS ﬂexibility in how it establishes contracts with another
AS, a task that should be unconstrained.
Ideally, an interdomain routing system should preserve au-
tonomy, ﬁltering expressiveness, and ranking expressiveness.
However, the ability to specify highly expressive rankings
comes at considerable cost to system robustness: as has been
observed by Varadhan et al. and Grifﬁn et al., among others, if
there are no constraints on the rankings that an AS can specify,
BGP may violate safety (i.e., oscillate forever) [14], [22].
Example 1: Consider Fig. 1 [14], [22]. ASes 1, 2, and 3
each prefer the indirect path through their neighboring AS in
the clockwise direction over the direct path to the destination,
0. All other paths are ﬁltered. This conﬁguration has no stable
path assignment (i.e., a path assignment from which no node

would deviate). For example, consider the path assignment (10,
210, 30); in this case, AS 1 has a better path available, 130,
so it switches paths. This switch breaks the path 210, causing
AS 2 to switch to its second choice, path 20. The resulting path
assignment, (130, 20, 30), is a permutation of the original path
assignment: this time, AS 3 has the path 320 available, so it
switches. This oscillation continues forever.
As the previous example suggests, full autonomy and ex-
pressiveness can have undesirable consequences. Routing
protocol update messages should reﬂect actual reachability
changes in the network topology or policy. Unfortunately,
in BGP, conﬂicting policies can cause oscillations that pro-
duce endless streams of routing updates that are unrelated
to changes in topology or policy. This instability creates nu-
merous performance problems, may cause network partitions,
and complicates diagnosis and debugging of problems in the
routing system. Worse yet, a network operator has no way to
guarantee that any given conﬁguration of rankings and ﬁlters
will not adversely interact with the policies of other ASes. In
light of these issues, developing rigorous conditions on policy
expressiveness that guarantee routing stability, while preserving
autonomy, is crucial.
This paper explores the following question: if each AS retains
complete autonomy and complete ﬁltering expressiveness, how
expressive can rankings be while guaranteeing stable routing?
This question is important because ranking autonomy and ﬁl-
tering expressiveness reﬂect the realities of how ASes specify
policies today, and little is known (beyond the results surveyed
in Section II) about the tradeoffs between autonomy and expres-
siveness as far as routing stability is concerned, especially under
ﬁltering. In particular, our work is the ﬁrst to develop neces-
sary conditions for stability under realistic assumptions about
autonomy and expressiveness and the ﬁrst to derive necessary
conditions for stability under ﬁltering in policy routing.
We acknowledge that our requirements for complete au-
tonomy and ﬁltering expressiveness are strong; indeed, given
the negative results presented in this paper, it may be reasonable
to ask whether they are too strong. Nevertheless, we believe
that the assumptions are not unnecessarily strong, because
complete ﬁltering expressiveness essentially reﬂects the re-
alities of today’s business landscape, where a provider has
complete ﬂexibility to form contracts (i.e., exchange routing
information) with any other party. Thus, we believe that this
paper studies routing stability guarantees from a reasonable
point in the design space.
This paper makes three main contributions. First,
in
Section IV-A, we show that rankings based solely on the
immediate next-hop AS en route to the destination may never
reach a stable path assignment from an arbitrary initial state;
i.e., next-hop rankings, which are common in practice, are not
safe. Moreover, under unrestricted ﬁltering, a routing system
with next-hop rankings may have no stable path assignment. In
addition to their operational implications, these results are also
somewhat surprising, because next-hop rankings with no route
ﬁltering always have a stable path assignment. We also observe
that, although rankings based on a globally consistent weighting
of paths are safe under ﬁltering, even minor generalizations of
the weighting function compromise safety (Section IV-B).
Second, we deﬁne a dispute ring, a special case of the “dis-
pute wheel” (a group of nodes whose rankings have a particular
form) of Grifﬁn et al. [14], and show that any routing protocol
that has a dispute ring is not safe under ﬁltering (Section V).
Using the dispute wheel concept, Grifﬁn et al. showed a suf-
ﬁcient condition for safety, proving that if a routing system is
unsafe then it must have a dispute wheel. In contrast, our result
is the ﬁrst known necessary condition for safety under ﬁltering.
Third, we show that, providing for complete autonomy and
ﬁltering expressiveness, if providers directly choose their rank-
ings, then the set of allowable rankings that guarantee safety
is tightly constrained. In Section VI, we prove that any routing
system that permits paths of length
to be ranked over
can have a dispute ring, and is thus unsafe
paths of length
under ﬁltering. We also prove that any routing system that per-
mits paths of length
can have a dispute wheel. In summary, our results indicate that
stable policy routing with provider autonomy and expressive ﬁl-
tering requires tight constraints on rankings.
to be ranked over paths of length
Recent work has observed that routing protocols whose rank-
ings are derived from a “strictly monotonic” algebra are guar-
anteed to converge [13], [15], [20], [21]; informally, a strictly
monotonic algebra is one where a path has a higher cost (i.e., is
less preferred) than any of its subpaths. In cases of unrestricted
ﬁltering, these strictly monotonic algebras represent a general-
ization of shortest paths routing, which is consistent with our
results in Section VI. We discuss such mechanisms further in
Section VII.
Our ﬁndings may be interpreted in several ways. The opti-
mist will note that checking a set of rankings to ensure safety
is trivial, because all it requires is that BGP routers modify the
decision process to consult a route’s “local preference” attribute
only after considering its AS path length. The pessimist, how-
ever, may conclude that guaranteeing safe routing while pre-
serving autonomy may yield constraints on expressiveness that
are too strong. In either case, the results proved in this paper
about the fundamental tradeoff between expressiveness and au-
tonomy may help guide the design of stable interdomain routing
protocols in the future. Section VII explores this tradeoff in fur-
ther detail.
II. BACKGROUND
Because Internet routing is policy-based, and each AS has
the ﬂexibility to deﬁne its own policies independently of other
ASes, the policies of one AS may interact with those of another
to cause the protocol to oscillate. Seminal work by Varadhan
et al. observed that policy-based interdomain routing protocols
could oscillate and deﬁned the concept of safety [22], [23].
Varadhan et al. also conjectured that routing systems that
allow rankings other than those based on next-hop rankings
or shortest path routing may be unsafe [22], [23]. In fact, in
Section IV, we show that even routing systems that only allow
next-hop rankings are not safe.

ographic regions.
Grifﬁn et al. asked how expressive an autonomous, robust
routing system can be [13]; we address this question in this
paper. Varadhan et al. observed that a routing system with an
acyclic topology will have at least one stable path assignment
if participants can only express next-hop preferences [22], [23].
We show that when BGP’s protocol dynamics are taken into ac-
count, restricting each AS to only next-hop rankings does not
guarantee that the routing system will be safe (even though the
routing system always has at least one stable path assignment).
Various previous work has studied global conditions to guar-
antee the safety of routing systems; global conditions presume
that the routing system does not preserve local choice of rank-
ings (i.e., ranking autonomy). Grifﬁn et al. showed that, if the
rankings of the ASes in a routing system do not form a dispute
wheel (a concept that describes the global relationship between
the rankings of a set of ASes), then the routing system is safe
[14]. Grifﬁn et al. also examined robustness, the property that
safety is guaranteed even if arbitrary nodes or edges are removed
from the graph. We view robustness as a special case of ﬁltering:
removing an edge can be achieved if the ASes incident to that
edge ﬁlter all routes through that edge; removing a node entails
having all ASes ﬁlter all routes through that node.
Gao and Rexford derived sufﬁcient constraints on rankings,
ﬁltering, and global network topology to guarantee routing sta-
bility; they also observe that these constraints reﬂect today’s
common practice [8], [9]. They showed that if every AS con-
siders each of its neighbors as either a customer, a provider,
or a peer, and obeys certain local constraints on rankings and
ﬁltering, and if the routing system satisﬁes certain topological
constraints, then BGP is stable.1 However, their model does not
incorporate ranking autonomy, because their proposed topolog-
ical constraints are global. The example below illustrates why
the restrictions of Gao and Rexford may sometimes be too strict.
Example 2: Consider Fig. 2; there are hundreds of similar
real-world examples [2]. AS 1 and AS 2, two ISPs, peer in North
America, but AS 1 buys service from AS 2 in Europe (in prac-
tice, this arrangement may occur if AS 1 does not have a Euro-
pean backbone). Suppose that AS 2 peers with AS 3 in North
America, and AS 1 peers with AS 3 in Europe. This arrange-
ment is precisely the “peer-provider” cycle that is prohibited by
some of the convergence conditions of Gao and Rexford (e.g.,
Guideline A, [9]). This scenario mandates that AS 2 prefer the
route to all destinations via AS 1 over AS 3, even destinations
in North America.
The sufﬁcient conditions of Grifﬁn et al. require global
knowledge of rankings [14]. Those of Gao and Rexford require
1Grifﬁn et al. noted that analogous sufﬁcient conditions apply to iBGP with
route reﬂection [17], although we show in previous work [3] that these condi-
tions are unnecessarily strong.
global knowledge of the AS-level topology. Furthermore, the
work of Grifﬁn et al. does not consider the effects of ﬁltering,
and the conditions of Gao and Rexford restrict ﬁltering se-
verely. Our goal is to derive constraints that must hold on the
conﬁguration of a single AS without any global knowledge.
Grifﬁn et al. also showed how to modify a BGP-like path
vector protocol to detect the existence of a dispute wheel but
left unspeciﬁed how the ASes should resolve the dispute wheel
[16]. Machiraju and Katz deﬁned a new global invariant for de-
termining safety when at most one AS deviates from the con-
ditions of Gao and Rexford [19]. Govindan et al. proposed a
routing architecture where ASes coordinate their policies [11],
[12] using a standardized policy speciﬁcation language [1]. Jag-
gard and Ramachandran presented global conditions that guar-
antee safety of routing systems that allow ASes to express only
next-hop preferences over routes, and designed centralized and
distributed algorithms to check these global conditions [18].
Gouda and Schneider study classes of routing protocol metrics
for which each node in a routing tree has its most preferred path,
but do not address routing stability [10]. In contrast to these
studies of global conditions for safety, we study the conditions
under which a policy-based interdomain routing protocol can be
safe if it preserves the autonomy of each AS.
More recent work has attempted to design policy-based pro-
tocols that are guaranteed to converge without imposing any
global conditions. Sobrinho described global relationships be-
tween preferences in an algebraic framework [20], [21], and
incorporated several previous results (including those of both
Grifﬁn et al. [14] and Gao and Rexford [9]). He examined re-
quirements for convergence and asserted that any vectoring pro-
tocol that preserves “strict monotonicity” is guaranteed to con-
verge. Recent work on “metarouting” exploits this algebraic
framework to allow designers to specify new routing protocols
that are guaranteed to converge by requiring algebras that pre-
serve strict monotonicity [15]. Strictly monotonic routing pro-
tocols may be viewed as extensions of shortest path routing to
a more general algebraic setting; in this sense the design prin-
ciples of metarouting are consistent with the characterization
results of our paper. For further details, see Section VII.
III. ROUTING MODEL AND DEFINITIONS
We now deﬁne our routing model. After introducing some
basic terminology, we formally deﬁne two notions of good be-
havior for routing protocols: stability and safety. Finally, we ex-
tend each of these two deﬁnitions to handle ﬁltering expressive-
ness.
A. Preliminaries
We consider a model consisting of ASes (nodes),2 labeled
. Each of these nodes wishes to establish a path (de-
ﬁned below) to a single destination, labeled 0.

Note that we have deﬁned the path to be loop-free, as BGP
typically discards paths that have loops in the AS-level path.
