### Cyber Security in Schools and Colleges in England and Wales

Cyber security education in schools is the foundation for developing interest and eventually leading to higher education. According to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), 40% of universities in the UK have achieved Cyber Essentials certification, with nearly a third of colleges following suit [11]. However, there is still a significant gap in the provision of cyber security education across all sectors, which warrants further research.

### Threats in Higher and Further Education

Cyber security threats in higher education (HE) and further education (FE) are on the rise, with data breaches, ransomware, malware, and patch management being the top concerns. In FE, the third most mentioned threat is ransomware/malware, followed by DDoS attacks, internal malicious attacks, and data breaches [8].

### Cyber Security Training

Cyber security training should be mandatory in all educational sectors for both staff and students, given the daily use of computers. The Cyber Security Posture survey [8] indicates that compulsory staff training is more common than student training in HE and FE. This highlights the need for increased awareness and training for both staff and learners. Over a three-year period, FE staff received the same amount of training (55%), while HE staff saw an increase to 81%. Student information security awareness training in HE, however, decreased by 7% from the previous year. This underscores the need for more compulsory training for both staff and students in FE. Ensuring that funding is available is key to providing such training.

### Impact of COVID-19

The impact of COVID-19 on education at all levels has led to government funding for schools, colleges, and universities in England [13] and Wales [7]. Research has identified a gap in Wales, where only a small percentage of the workforce is focused, and the majority of UK analysis is centered in England. Employees are often leaving or moving across the border from Wales for higher-paying jobs, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

### Collaboration and Innovation

With the growing sophistication of cyber threats, there is a need for improved strategies in education, informed by collaboration between government, academia, and industry. The continuing trend in cybercrime highlights that education provision is struggling to keep pace with workforce requirements. For instance, education and training institutions in the United States have found it difficult to meet the growing demand for cyber talent [10].

### Initiatives and Resources

Despite numerous innovations and incentives for younger learners to engage in cyber security as a career path, there is still a shortage of learners progressing to further and higher education courses. The level of qualification required depends on the job role. A recent government study on the cyber security skills of the UK labor market [15] identifies the minimum education requirements for core and cyber-enabled postings from September 2016 to August 2019.

### Case Studies and Competitions

Initiatives such as competitions can increase learner interest and knowledge, promoting teamwork and cooperation. These activities help students work on real-life scenarios, cultivating a mindset for a changing environment. Cyber UK brings together government, academia, and industry to develop global expertise in this crucial field. The introduction of Cyber First [25] offers a range of opportunities, including girls' competitions and courses for 11-17-year-olds, helping to introduce the younger generation to cyber security and providing bursaries and degree apprenticeships.

### Online Resources

Online resources aimed at younger learners are available through the National Crime Agency (NCA) as part of the Cyber Security Challenge UK (CSCUK), offering free access to interactive modules designed to teach the fundamentals of cyber security [25]. The Education Network provides a variety of online resources for key stages 1 to 4, including links to ICT and STEM modules. Some of these resources are freely available, while others require a login, as they are licensed only to schools [26]. The NCSC also offers recognition and support for educators and the development of the Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge [30].

### Secondary and Further Education

In secondary education, learners use applications to problem-solve, present information, and communicate. However, this is limited by the curriculum and the capabilities of their teachers. GCSE Computer Science covers a broad range of knowledge, including coding, security, and networks. Different awarding bodies include elements of cyber security, but it is a small, theory-based part of the qualification without practical components.

### Higher Education

Higher education institutions deliver specialized cyber security courses, but the current provision varies across the UK. While some universities are sector leaders, the provision in schools and colleges does not provide enough depth and scope for the next generation of cyber security specialists. Programs that use competitions and learning environments to teach in-depth knowledge and skills are filling this void, but this research is based on the number of hours of practice and preparation needed.

### Staff Development

Training and staff development in cyber security are not compulsory in schools in England and Wales. An Estyn report highlighted that schools need guidance to integrate cyber security into the curriculum, with clear indicators to build opportunities. Staff training is essential to build confidence and competence in teaching the complexities of cyber security.

### Future Provision

Future developments in cyber security education will involve collaborative initiatives from government, industry, academia, and professional bodies. Establishments should use the Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) [30] as a guide for staff development and to map the curriculum. The closure of schools, colleges, and universities due to exceptional circumstances has affected teaching and learning on a vast scale. The future provision of education will likely involve a combination of blended learning, with a set number of classroom hours and remote delivery.

### Integrity and Ethics

Learners are responsible for their own education, and this includes developing acceptable morals and social values in the context of digital technology. The challenges of ensuring integrity and ethics in the digital age are critical, and education must address these issues to prepare students for the future.
