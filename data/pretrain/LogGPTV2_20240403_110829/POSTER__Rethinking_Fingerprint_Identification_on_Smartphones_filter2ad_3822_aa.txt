### Abstract
Modern smartphones commonly use a small touch sensor for fingerprint identification, which captures only a partial portion of a fingerprint. Recently, we investigated the gap between the actual risk and user perception of latent fingerprints remaining on smartphones. We developed a fake fingerprint attack that exploits these latent fingerprints, successfully reconstructing a high-quality fake fingerprint image suitable for small touch sensors. In this paper, we conduct post hoc experimental studies to address previously overlooked or newly discovered aspects. First, we verify that our attack is not just conceptual but also realistic. We use the reconstructed image to create a fake fingerprint using conductive printing or silicon-like glue, and test it on real smartphones, including Samsung Galaxy S6, S7, and iPhone 5s, 6, 7. We have successfully bypassed the security of the Galaxy S6 and S7, and are currently working on the remaining devices. Additionally, we experimentally evaluate one of our proposed mitigation methods to assess its effectiveness in reducing the actual risk. Finally, we conduct a user survey to understand perceptions of the fake fingerprint attacks and the proposed mitigation methods.

## 1. Introduction
Fingerprint identification is widely adopted in today’s smartphones due to its convenience and perceived security for device unlocking, and this trend is expected to continue. One significant challenge with fingerprint identification on smartphones is that the touch sensor used is very small, capable of capturing only a limited portion of a fingerprint. Various methods for creating counterfeit fingerprints and bypassing small touch sensors have been disclosed [2, 4, 7], but they typically require a firm impression of the target user's fingerprint or a clear, high-quality image, which is often unrealistic in an attack context.

Recently, we developed a realistic attack called SCRAP, which exploits only the smudges and latent fingerprints left on a smartphone, without requiring a firm impression of the user's fingerprint. We successfully demonstrated the reconstruction of a high-quality fake fingerprint image for small touch sensors [5]. However, the question remains: Can the SCRAP attack pass the small touch sensors of real smartphones?

In this paper, we conduct post hoc experimental studies to explore this question. As shown in Figure 1, we found that even a half submission of a partial fingerprint can pass Touch ID (Figure 1-(b)), while latent fingerprints can be easily detected from daily smudges (Figure 1-(c)). After reviewing the SCRAP attack, we perform real attack experiments against various smartphones, including Samsung Galaxy S6, S7, and iPhone 5s, 6, 7. We also experimentally evaluate our proposed mitigation methods. Finally, we conduct a user survey to understand perceptions of the fake fingerprint attacks and the mitigation methods.

## 2. SCRAP Attack (ACSAC’17)
We briefly review our recent work [5] on the SCRAP attack, which directly exploits latent fingerprints left on a smartphone. The basic idea of SCRAP is to use fingerprint smudges left on the home button (as a key index of an authentic fingerprint) and more smudges left on the touchscreen (as a richer source of the authentic fingerprint) from daily use. Implementing this idea presented several challenges. One was to determine if users use the same finger for both the home button and the touchscreen. Another was to technically reconstruct a high-quality image of an authentic fingerprint from the messy smudges. A third challenge was to measure the quality of the reconstructed image to verify the success of our attack.

To investigate user behavior and the perception gap, we conducted in-person surveys involving 82 participants. The survey results showed that the fingers most frequently used on the touchscreen and the home button are the same, and users' risk perception is low. To reconstruct an authentic fingerprint image from messy smudges, we used image processing techniques and succeeded in reconstruction experiments involving seven users in six conditions. The SCRAP procedure includes:
1. Photographic smudge collection.
2. Fingerprint smudge matching, involving image preprocessing and SIFT-based matching.
3. Image quality assessment, involving damage identification and correction decisions.
4. Fingerprint image construction, involving image postprocessing for quality improvement.

We measured the quality of the reconstructed image in terms of minutiae quality, match scores, and fingerprint image quality (NFIQ) using NIST Biometric Image Software (NBIS).

## 3. Experimental Study
We conduct post hoc experimental studies of the SCRAP attack using various materials and strategies on commercial smartphones. Our target devices include Samsung Galaxy S6, S7, and iPhone 5s, 6, 7. We asked a target user to enroll their fingerprint. To perform real attack experiments, we examined well-known fingerprint spoofing techniques that typically require a firm impression of a fingerprint and applied the SCRAP-reconstructed fingerprint image to these settings. These techniques include forgery using wood glue [6], conductive printing [2], and mold combining hot glue and wood glue [7]. Figure 2 and Table 1 show the results of our experiments in progress. For forming fake fingerprints, we use polyvinyl acetate emulsion and an EPSON L361 printer with AgIC conductive ink and AgIC special paper in each experiment scenario.

### 3.1 Conductive Printing
In 2016, Cao et al. [2] demonstrated that conductive printing is a potential forgery method for attacking smartphone touch sensors. They used AgIC conductive ink and AgIC special paper to print a firm impression of a fingerprint and used the print as a fake fingerprint. They claimed this method is faster and more consistent than traditional forgery methods using wood glue. They conducted experiments with Samsung Galaxy S6 and Huawei Honor 7 to prove the effectiveness of their method. However, Cao et al. required a firm impression of a fingerprint, which is often impractical in an attack context.
