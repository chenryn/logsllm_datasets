ABSTRACT
Modern smartphones popularly adopt a small touch sensor for (cid:128)n-
gerprint identi(cid:128)cation of a user, but it captures only a partial limited
portion of a (cid:128)ngerprint. Recently we have studied a gap between
actual risk and user perception of latent (cid:128)ngerprints remaining on
a smartphone, and developed a fake (cid:128)ngerprint a(cid:138)ack that exploits
the latent (cid:128)ngerprints as actual risk. We successfully reconstructed
a fake (cid:128)ngerprint image in good quality for small touch sensors. In
this paper, we subsequently conduct post hoc experimental studies
on the facts that we have missed or have since learned. First of all,
we examine that the presented a(cid:138)ack is not conceptual but realistic.
We employ the reconstructed image and make its fake (cid:128)ngerprint,
using a conductive printing or a silicon-like glue, to pass directly
the touch sensor of real smartphones. Our target smartphones are
Samsung Galaxy S6, S7 and iPhone 5s, 6, 7. Indeed we have suc-
ceeded in passing Galaxy S6, S7, and now work on the remaining
smartphones. We also conduct an experimental study for one of
our mitigation methods to see how it can reduce actual risk. Finally,
we perform a user survey study to understand user perception on
the fake (cid:128)ngerprint a(cid:138)acks and the mitigation methods.

1 INTRODUCTION
Fingerprint identi(cid:128)cation is widely adopted in today’s smartphones
because of its convenience and believed-safety for device unlocking,
and this trend is expected to continue in the future. One of the
problems in (cid:128)ngerprint identi(cid:128)cation on smartphones is that the
touch sensor used here is very small — it is capable of capturing
only a partial limited portion of a (cid:128)ngerprint. Accordingly, various
methods of manufacturing counterfeit (cid:128)ngerprints and passing the
small touch sensors have been disclosed [2, 4, 7], but they commonly
required a (cid:128)rm impression of a target user’s (cid:128)ngerprint or its clear
image in a good condition — unrealistic in a sense of a(cid:138)acks.
Lately, aiming at realistic a(cid:138)acks, we studied a fake (cid:128)ngerprint
a(cid:138)ack called SCRAP, which exploits only smudges and latent (cid:128)n-
gerprints remaining on a smartphone, i.e., without requiring the
(cid:128)rm impression of a user, and successfully showed to reconstruct a
fake (cid:128)ngerprint image in good quality for small touch sensors [5].

However, the question still remains: Is it possible for the SCRAP
a(cid:138)ack to pass small touch sensors of real smartphones?
In this paper, to explore the answers, we subsequently conduct
post hoc experimental studies on the facts that we have missed or
have since learned. As pictured in Figure 1, we found that only a half
submission of a partial (cid:128)ngerprint successfully passed Touch ID as
in Figure 1-(b), while latent (cid:128)ngerprints were easily detected from
daily smudges as in Figure 1-(c). A(cid:137)er reviewing the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack,
we proceed with real a(cid:138)ack experiments against real smartphones,
such as Galaxy (Samsung Galaxy) S6, S7 and iPhone 5s, 6, 7, and
examine our mitigation methods as well experimentally. Finally,
we perform a user survey study to understand user perception on
the fake (cid:128)ngerprint a(cid:138)acks and the mitigation methods.
2 SCRAP ATTACK (ACSAC’17)
We brie(cid:131)y review our recent work [5] about the fake (cid:128)ngerprint
a(cid:138)ack that directly exploits latent (cid:128)ngerprints remaining on a smart-
phone. We call our a(cid:138)ack SCRAP. (cid:140)e basic idea of SCRAP was
to exploit (cid:128)ngerprint smudges le(cid:137) on a home bu(cid:138)on (as a key in-
dex of an authentic (cid:128)ngerprint) and more smudges [1] le(cid:137) on a
touch screen (as a richer source of the authentic (cid:128)ngerprint) of a
smartphone exposed to a daily use. (cid:140)ere were several challenges
to implement this idea. One was to examine the user’s behavior
whether the same (cid:128)nger is used for activities on both home bu(cid:138)on
and touch screen. Another was to technically reconstruct an image
of an authentic (cid:128)ngerprint in good quality, only from the messy
smudges found as above. (cid:140)e other was to measure the quality of
the reconstructed image for veri(cid:128)cation of the success in our a(cid:138)ack.
To investigate user’s touch behavior and perception gap, we
conducted in-person surveys involving 82 participants. (cid:140)e survey
results showed that the (cid:128)ngers most frequently used on the touch
screen and the home bu(cid:138)on are the same, and the user’s risk percep-
tion is very low. To reconstruct an authentic (cid:128)ngerprint image from
messy smudges, we used domain knowledge of image processing
and succeeded in reconstruction experiments that involve seven
users in six conditions. (cid:140)e procedure of SCRAP includes (1) pho-
tographic smudge collection, (2) (cid:128)ngerprint smudge matching that

involves image preprocessing and SIFT-based matching, (3) image
quality assessment that involves damage identi(cid:128)cation and correc-
tion decision, and (4) (cid:128)ngerprint image construction that involves
image postprocessing for quality improvement. We measured the
quality of the reconstructed image with regard to minutiae qual-
ity, match scores, and (cid:128)ngerprint image quality (NFIQ) under the
domain of NIST Biometric Image So(cid:137)ware (NBIS).
3 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
We conduct the post hoc experimental study of the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack
using various materials and strategies on commodity smartphones.
Our target devices include Galaxy S6, S7 and iPhone 5s, 6, 7 in
our experiments. We asked a target user to enroll the (cid:128)ngerprint.
To perform real a(cid:138)ack experiments, we examined the well-known
(cid:128)ngerprint spoo(cid:128)ng techniques that actually required a (cid:128)rm im-
pression of a (cid:128)ngerprint, and employed such experimental se(cid:138)ings.
(cid:140)ey include forgery techniques using wood glue [6], conductive
printing [2], and mold combining of hot glue and wood glue [7]. We
apply the (cid:128)ngerprint image reconstructed by SCRAP to such set-
tings. Figure 2 and Table 1, respectively, show the results in progress
of our experiments. To form fake (cid:128)ngerprints, we use polyvinyl
acetate emulsion and EPSON L361 printer (AgIC conductive ink
and AgIC special paper) in each experiment scenario.
3.1 Conductive Printing
In 2016, Cao et al. [2] showed that a conductive printing is a po-
tential forgery method for a(cid:138)acking smartphone touch sensors.
(cid:140)ey used AgIC conductive ink and AgIC special paper to print
out a (cid:128)rm impression of a (cid:128)ngerprint, and used the print as a fake
(cid:128)ngerprint for their a(cid:138)ack. (cid:140)ey claimed that this method is much
faster and more consistent than conventional forgery methods us-
ing wood glue. (cid:140)ey conducted experiments with Galaxy S6 and
Huawei Honor 7 to prove the e(cid:130)ectiveness of the proposed method.
However, Cao et al. required that a (cid:128)rm impression of a (cid:128)ngerprint
