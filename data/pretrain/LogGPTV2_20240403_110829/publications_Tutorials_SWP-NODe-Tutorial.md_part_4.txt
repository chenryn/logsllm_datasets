### WSDL Port Type
The WSDL port type offered by the service to its customers...

### Roles
...

### BPEL4WS
**BPEL4WS (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services)**
- **Example: The Process**
  - This section defines the data containers used by the process, providing their definitions in terms of WSDL message types.
  - Example:
    ```xml
    <messageType="lns:InvMessage"/>
    <tName="lns:cannotCompleteOrder" operation="sendPurchaseOrder"/>
    ```
  - This section contains fault handlers, defining the activities that must be executed in response to faults.

### DAML-S
**DAML-S (DARPA Agent Markup Language - Services)**
- **Introduction**
  - DAML-S provides support for the following:
    - Process description
    - Selection, composition, and interoperation
    - Invocation
    - Execution and monitoring
- **Constructs**
  - Concurrency and synchronization
  - Sequential execution of activities

### Ontologies and Service Profile
- **Ontologies**
  - DAML-S defines ontologies for the construction of service models.
- **Service Profile**
  - Provides details about a service, including:
    - Inputs and outputs
    - Precondition and effects
    - Process model
- **Service Grounding**
  - Describes how to access the service.

### Comparison: BPEL4WS vs. DAML-S
- **BPEL4WS**
  - Closely related to the Service Model (Process Model) component of DAML-S.
  - Defines mechanisms for catching and handling faults and setting compensation handlers.
  - Includes WS-Coordination and WS-Transaction for predefined transactional semantics.
- **DAML-S**
  - Provides a richer representation of services through classes.
  - Allows reasoning and drawing properties from inheritance and other relationships.

### Quality of Service (QoS)
- **Semantic QoS**
  - Organizations operating in modern markets, such as e-commerce, require QoS management.
  - BPEL4WS has complex semantics for determining activity execution within blocks.
- **New Requirements**
  - The autonomy of web services does not allow designers to identify operational metrics at design time.
  - When composing processes, it is essential to inquire about the operational metrics of web services.

### QoS Semantics
- **Benefits**
  - Composition of processes according to QoS objectives and requirements.
  - Selection and execution of processes based on QoS metrics.
  - Monitoring of processes to ensure compliance with initial QoS requirements.
  - Evaluation of alternative strategies when QoS requirements are violated.

### Research Issues
- **QoS Specification**
  - What dimensions need to be part of the QoS model for processes?
- **Computation**
  - Methods and algorithms for computing, analyzing, and predicting QoS.
- **Monitoring**
  - Tools needed for QoS monitoring.
- **Control**
  - Mechanisms for controlling processes in response to unsatisfactory QoS metrics.

### QoS Models
- **Dimensions**
  - Security
  - Time
  - Cost
  - Price
  - Fidelity
  - Duration
  - Reliability
  - Repudiation
  - Availability

### QoS in METEO-R S
- **Creation of Estimates**
  - To analyze a process QoS, it is necessary to:
    - Create estimates for task QoS metrics.
    - Create estimates for transition probabilities.
  - Once tasks and transitions have their estimates set, QoS algorithms and mechanisms, such as simulation, can be applied to compute the overall QoS of a process.

### Web Process QoS Computation
- **Estimates for Web Services**
  - Description of web service runtime behavior can be composed of several classes, such as:
    - Linear programming
    - Basic class
    - Distributional class
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    Security: Normal(0.674, 0.143)
    Price: 0.291, 0.674, 0.895
    Duration: Trapezoidal(0.7, 1, 1, 4)
    ```

### QoS Computation Techniques
- **Graph Reduction**
  - Technique for reducing the complexity of the process graph.
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    T(tij) = T(ti) + T(tj)
    C(tij) = C(ti) + C(tj)
    R(tij) = R(ti) * R(tj)
    ```
