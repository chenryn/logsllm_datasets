`deno install` is excellent for installing scripts, but it seems that it could
only install ts (and js?) files through dependencies.
For example, `std/http/file_server.ts` is a simple file server which needs
some html template to generate page, but it could only put all html template
files(and even a lot of css files) inside the ts file as a string. Maybe it
works, but it is not elegant and graceful enough to manage these strings. And
this solution is not suit for images(such as favicon.ico) as they are binary
files.
More about this example you can see this:
https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/master/std/http/file_server.ts#L200-L288  
(It puts all the html and css inside the ts file as a string which is ugly)
The best solution I found is to clone the whole repo(with html and css files
outside of ts file) to disk and use `deno install ./index.ts` manually to
install my scripts locally. This install method is too complex and not
fascinating at all; thus I was think of some feature such as `deno install
https://github.com/name/repo` to run the same as `git clone ... && deno
install -n repo ./repo/xxx.ts`?
Looking forward to your reply and thanks in advance.
