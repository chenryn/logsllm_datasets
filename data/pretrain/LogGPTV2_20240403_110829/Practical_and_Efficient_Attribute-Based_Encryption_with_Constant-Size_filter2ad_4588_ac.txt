Theorem 4.2. The challenger can break the Token Privacy Game with a neg-
ligible advantage if the probability of getting w from H(w) is negligible ν.
Proof: Setup: The challenger plays as the system and runs Setup(U, 1λ) as
in the scheme, then it makes the pk = (ga, gb, gc, (ui, yi)|1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) public and
keeps the master key msk = (a, b, c, (ri, xi)|1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) where a, b, c,{ri|i =
1, 2,··· , 2n} ← Zp,{xi|i = 1, 2,··· , 2n} ← G and ui = g
(cid:0)ri, yi = e(xi, g).
Query Phase 1: As in SCKA game, the challenger selects the key list kl
which is empty initially.The adversary can execute below process for polynomial
times qt. The adversary chooses a attribute set Attr as the input of KeyGen
algorithm. The challenger returns KeyGen’s output sk to adversary and add
Attr into kl. Then, challenger runs TokenGen algorithm and returns token tok =
(gs, ys
user, tok1, tok2) to adversary after receiving the sk and keyword w.
(The marks such as tok1, tok2 are the same as the scheme.)

practical scene, |W D| is big enough. Finally, our scheme can gurantee the token

From the Construction section, we can prove the correctness of our proposed
scheme. Combining with the above proofs, we can say the scheme satis(cid:12)es the
Index Privacy and Token Privacy. In general, the EABSE scheme is secure.

5 Performance and E(cid:14)ciency Analysis
In the practical scenes, the users prefer the scheme with quicker response
and less bandwidth cost. Therefore, we considered the e(cid:14)ciency of the scheme
when we designed the scheme. In our scheme, we achieved the constant-size ci-
phertext. Basing on the computation on the group of prime order p, we mainly
evaluate the exponentiation operation, multiplication operation and pairing op-
eration in time complexity and the size of group G and GT in space complexity.
It is worth mentioning that multiplication operation is much more e(cid:14)cient than
the exponentiation.
Compared to the CP-ABKS works in [14], we analyse the e(cid:14)ciency of the
scheme from the two aspects of time complexity and space complexity. The
results are showed in below tables Table1 and Table2. E denotes the exponen-
tiation operation on the element in group G, ET denotes the exponentiation
operation on the element in group GT . Similarly, M denotes the multiplication
operation on the element in group G, MT denotes the multiplication operation
on the element in group GT . And Pair is the symbol of the pairing operation.
We use |G| and |GT| as the remarks of the size of G and GT respectively. At last,
we use N to represent the number of attributes which satisfy the access policy
and S to represent the number of attributes which owned by the data-user. (In
our scheme, S=N.)

Table 2: Space Complexity Analysis
Considering the balance of time complexity and space complexity, our scheme
aggregated σ1, σ2,··· , σn into σuser and y1, y2,··· , yn into yuser in KeyGen
phase. This behavior reduced the sizes of secret key and token, thus saving
the bandwidth cost. There is a transformation of our scheme. We can trans-
mit σ1, σ2,··· , σn and y1, y2,··· , yn as parts of the secret key. Then the cloud
server should (cid:12)rstly aggregate the tokens σs
i in the Search phase. The com-
putation works is transferred to the cloud server from the client. However, the
communication cost between cloud server and the data user rise.

6 Conclusion
We introduced an e(cid:14)cient searchable scheme basing on the ciphertext-policy
attribute-based encryption. The EABSE scheme allows secure data share in
multi-owners and multi-users system model. The data owners upload the data
wrapped with a certain access policy, and others can not get any information
about the data whose attributes can not satisfy the access policy. While the
authenticated data users are able to search a keyword w on the ciphertexts and
get the encrypted (cid:12)les including w. Besides, the search token is generated by
data users. This action prevents the keyword that users queried from being
known by owners and improves the users’ privacy. It is mentioned that, our
scheme raises the e(cid:14)ciency of computation and reduces the cost of communi-
cation because of the constant-size ciphertext. Our performance and e(cid:14)ciency
analysis illustrates this point e(cid:11)ectively. The new requirements also rises with
the times, so the e(cid:14)cient search on the dynamic dataset is still for future work.
