Techniques to Evade Detection
 Our ML Tool...
 Shortens payload per unique user 
 Auto-tweets at irregular intervals
 Triages users wrt value/engagement
 Prepends tweets with @mention
 Obeys rate limits
 We added...

Recon and Footprinting for Profiling
 Compute histogram of tweet timings 
(binsize = 1 hour)
 Random minute within max hour to tweet
 Bag of Words on timeline tweets
 Select most commonly occurring non-
stopword
 We seed the neural network with topics that 
the user frequently posts about

Leveraging Markov Models
 Popular for text generation: see 
/r/SubredditSimulator, InfosecTalk
TitleBot
 Calculates pairwise frequency of tokens 
and uses that to generate new ones
 Trained using the most recent posts on

Language and Social Network Agnosticism
 Markov models only use content on user’s timeline, which 
means they can automatically generate content in other 
languages
 For neural nets, you’d only need to scrape data from the target 
language and retrain
 Both of these methods can also be applied to other social 
networks

Here’s a malicious URL...

#WeaponizeMe
And, apparently goo.gl lets us shorten it!

#WeaponizeMe
goo.gl also gives us analytics

#WeaponizeMe
Initial Experiment
 We sent 90 “phishing” posts out to people 
using #cat
 After 2 hours, we had 17% clickthrough rate
 After 2 days, we had between 30% and 66% 
clickthrough rate
 Inside the Data
 goo.gl showed 27 clickthroughs (30%) came 
from a t.co referrer
 Unknown referrers might be caused by bots
 With unique locations, clickthrough rate may be 
as high as 66%

Mitigations
 Of course, we’re white hats here…
 But machine learning is rapidly becoming 
automated, so black hats would have this 
capability soon.
 Protected accounts are immune to 
timeline scraping, which defeats the tool
 Bots can be detected
 Standard mitigations apply:
 Don’t click on links from people you don’t 
know
 Report! Twitter is pretty good at flagging 
spam accounts
 Maybe URL shorteners should be 
responsible for malware?

Black Hat Sound Bytes
 Machine learning can be used 
offensively to automate spear phishing
 Machine-generated grammar is bad, but 
Twitter users DGAF
 Abundant personal data is publicly 
accessible and effective for social
