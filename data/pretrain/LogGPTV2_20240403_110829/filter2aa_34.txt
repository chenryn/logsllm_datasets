## Introduction
If you are concerned about phishing on social media, this presentation is for you.

### TL;DR
Our tool automates the process of spear phishing on Twitter, achieving a success rate of over 30%.

### Comparison of Methods
| Method            | Level of Effort   | Success Rate |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Our Tool          | Fully Automated   | >30%         |
| Traditional Spear Phishing | Highly Manual | 45%          |
| General Phishing  | Mostly Automated  | 5-14%        |

## Historical Context
- **1966**: ELIZA chatbot by Joseph Weizenbaum, MIT
- **2016**: @TayandYou AI Chatbot by Microsoft

Traditionally, Information Security (InfoSec) machine learning has focused on defense. We aim to explore its offensive capabilities.

## Why Twitter?
- **Bot-friendly API**
- **Colloquial syntax**
- **Shortened links**
- **Trusting culture**
- **Incentivized data disclosure**

### Techniques to Evade Detection
- **Payload Shortening**: Unique per user
- **Irregular Tweeting Intervals**
- **User Triage**: Based on value and engagement
- **@Mentions**: Prepends tweets with mentions
- **Rate Limit Compliance**
- **Non-Phishing Posts**: To build a believable profile

## The #SMACK Tool
- **Twitter Profiles**
- **Payloads**
- **Harvesting**

### Design Flow
1. `is_target(user)`
2. `get_timeline(depth)`
3. `gen_markov_tweet()`
4. `gen_nn_tweet()`
5. `schedule_tweet_and_sleep()`
6. `post_tweet_and_sleep()`

### Automated Target Discovery
- **Feature Extraction from GET users/lookup**
  - Engagement metrics
  - #myFirstTweet
  - Default settings
  - Description content
  - Account age

- **Clustering to Predict High-Value Users**

### Recon and Footprinting for Profiling
- **Histogram of Tweet Timings**: Binsize = 1 hour
- **Random Minute Selection**: Within the most active hour
- **Bag of Words Analysis**: On timeline tweets
- **Neural Network Seeding**: With frequent topics

### Leveraging Markov Models
- **Text Generation**: Popular for generating text, e.g., /r/SubredditSimulator, InfosecTalkTitleBot
- **Token Pair Frequency Calculation**: Generates new content
- **Training**: Using the most recent posts on the user’s timeline

### Inside LSTM Neural Networks
- **LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)**
- **Training Details**
  - Hosted on Amazon EC2
  - Trained on g2.2xlarge instance (65¢ per hour)
  - Ubuntu (ami-c79b7eac)
  - Trained on over 2 million tweets
  - Training duration: 3 days

### Language and Social Network Agnosticism
- **Markov Models**: Can generate content in any language
- **Neural Networks**: Require retraining with target language data
- **Applicability**: Both methods can be applied to other social networks

---

## Evaluation and Metrics
- **Initial Experiment**
  - Sent 90 "phishing" posts using #cat
  - After 2 hours: 17% clickthrough rate
  - After 2 days: 30-66% clickthrough rate
  - Analytics: 27 clickthroughs (30%) from t.co referrer
  - Unknown referrers: Possible bot activity
  - Unique locations: Clickthrough rate as high as 66%

## Man vs. Machine
- **Bake Off**: Planned humans vs. machine competition
- **Stay Tuned**: For the results!

## Demo of Our #SMACK Tool
- **Framework Demonstration**

---

## Wrap Up
- **Mitigations**
  - Protected accounts: Immune to timeline scraping
  - Bot detection
  - Standard mitigations:
    - Do not click on links from unknown sources
    - Report spam accounts
    - Consider URL shortener responsibility for malware

### Black Hat Sound Bytes
- **Machine Learning Offensive Use**: Automates spear phishing
- **Grammar Quality**: Not a significant issue on Twitter
- **Publicly Accessible Data**: Effective for social engineering
