After #11878 and #12020 pkg/registry is no longer coupled with etcd - it is
now (relatively) generic.
Few thing that we should cleanup there:
  * move any references to etcd to something more generic (e.g. pkg/registry/ _/etcd to pkg/registry/_ /storageclient) - please suggest better name for it :)
  * migrate services to use rest.StandardStorage and move it to service/ directory (from pkg/registry/etcd/)
  * unify limitrange and events with all other resources (all other resources have: registry.go, rest.go and etcd/etcd.go files) - events and limitrange are structured differently
  * refactor tests under pkg/registry/*/etcd directoris to use common testing infrastructure from pkg/api/rest/resttest
