IP addresses, we found that 74.220.199.15, 208.91.197.91, and
141.8.225.68 are located at the second, third, and fourth places
in the table, with suspicious information was found from
security information vendor. For IP address 208.91.197.91,
for instance, Ransomware Tracker [25] states that the address
is a ransomware IP, and Cymon [26] shows that malware,
phishing, and botnet activities are reported for the given
address as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, 22,805 R2 packets
pointing to the IP addresses can be considered to have a
deceptive dns_answer for malicious purpose.
For the 2013 dataset, we inspected the top-10 frequent
IP addresses. The total number of R2 packets that include
those addresses is 26,514, which is almost half of the number
in 2018. Speciﬁcally, in 2013, the most frequently appeared
address with 9,651 R2 packets is 74.220.199.15,
the sec-
ond rank in 2018, and it is the only address reported as
malicious. Moreover, there are 3 private network addresses,
192.168.1.254, 192.168.2.1, and 192.168.1.1 as a second,
third, and tenth places. More than 5k packets, in third place,
include the address 20.20.20.20, which is owned by Microsoft,
while 173.192.59.63 appeared in 995 packets (seventh rank),
221.238.203.46 in 811 packets (eighth rank), and 68.87.91.199
in 748 packets (ninth rank). As for the unusual point, 1,032
packets include 0.0.0.0.
2) Suspicious IP Addresses: Based on the possibility of ma-
licious activities performed by open resolvers, we conducted
a deeper analysis to identify the open resolvers misleading
users to malicious destination. For answers of IP addresses
in Table VII, we conducted an additional analysis using Cy-
mon API [27]. From Cymon, we gathered reported information
about the given addresses and judged their maliciousness. As
a result, we found that there were 335 IP addresses reported
as malicious. When there are multiple reports for different
categories, the most frequently reported category is selected.

Fig. 4. The information in Cymon about the IP address of 208.91.197.91
that ranks in the third highest reference in 2018. Note the multiple reports
about malware, botnet, phishing, etc. It can be assumed that the open resolvers
which redirect the users to this address are exploited by the adversaries.
category for the malicious IP address is malware. The number
of IP addresses related to malware is 170, accounting for over
half. Moreover, the number of IP addresses related to phishing
is 125, accounting for more than one third, alluding to the
possibilities of DNS poisoning or manipulation. Moreover, the
number of IP addresses reported as spam, SSH bruteforce,
scan, and botnet is about 40. When the analysis is conducted
w.r.t. the number of R2 packets, the result is different. In R2
packets, malware addresses account for more than 85% of the
total, which means that 170 malware reported addresses are
observed in R2, on average 136 times each. On the other hand,
the 125 phishing related IP addresses are observed in 2,878 R2
packets(≈10% of the total; 23 occurrences for each address).
To measure changes in the malicious use of open resolvers,
we also conducted the same analysis on the result in 2013. In
total, there were 100 unique malicious IP addresses in 12,874
responses. Among them, 65 addresses appearing in 11,149 R2
packets were reported as malware. For addresses reported as
phishing, there were 18 unique addresses that were included
in 1,092 responses. In addition to the above two categories,
500

16 IP addresses in 633 responses were reported as Spam, SSH
Bruteforce, Scan, Botnet, and Email Bruteforce.
The interesting observation we make by comparing the
results of 2013 and 2018 is that the malicious behavior of
open resolvers has increased from 12,874 to 26,926 in terms
of the number of R2 responses. This corresponds to more than
100% of increase. From the point of view of the unique IP
addresses in the R2 packets, the increase in malicious behavior
is also signiﬁcant: from 100 unique addresses to 335 addresses,
which is more than tripled (235%).
We notice that the number of unique IP addresses reported
as malware increased from 65 to 170, but the ratio to all
malicious addresses decreased from 65% to 50%. The most
rapid change can be found in phishing: from 19 in 2013 to
125 in 2018, which is about seven folds increase. The ratio is
also doubled from about 19% to 37%, indicating that today’s
open resolvers are more exploitable for phishing purposes than
before.
Our analysis can be considered as a lower bound of the
malicious activities in that it deals only with information in
Cymon. However, more malicious addresses can appear when
validating using threat information from multiple vendors.
Distribution of Malicious Resolvers. To further explore
malicious resolvers, we look up their geolocation and the
autonomous system (AS) using ip2location [28].
As a result, we found that 12,874 malicious resolvers in
2013 were distributed over 36 countries. Speciﬁcally, 12,616
resolvers (about 98%) were the US, 91 resolvers were in TR
(Turkey), 28 in VG (Virgin Islands), 24 in PL (Poland), and
18 in IR (Iran). Other 31 countries which had less than 10
malicious resolvers were (the number in the parentheses is the
number of resolvers in that country): BR (9), KR, TW (8), AR
(7), BG (6), ES, PT (5), AT, CA, DE, NL, VN (4), CH, RU,
SA (3), AU, ID, KE, SE (2), CN, FR, GB, HK, MA, NA, NI,
PR, SG, TH, VA, ZA (1). The country code by International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) can be found in [29].
In 2018, there were 31 countries with malicious resolvers.
21,819 out of 26,926 (about 81%) resolvers were located in the
US, 3,596 in IN (India), 714 in HK (Hong Kong), 291 in VG,
162 in AE (United Arab Emirates), and 146 in CN (China).
The countries where less than 100 resolvers were located are
DE (31), PL (24), RU (18), BG (16), NL (14), IE (12), AU,
KY (11), CA (8), FR, GB, JP (7), CH, PT (6), IT (5), SG, TR
(3), VN (2), AR, AT, ES, JO, LT, MY, and UA (1).
From the 2013 and 2018 datasets, we can see that the
percentage of malicious resolvers in the US at the top rank
moved from 98% to 81%, while the raw number increased
from 12,616 to 21,819. Moreover, there were ﬁve countries,
namely IN, HK, VG, AE, and CN, where the number of
malicious resolvers has increased 10x from 2013 to 2018. It
can be deduced that the wider the regional distribution of open
resolvers, the more negative impact those resolvers will likely
have on more people.
DNS Manipulation. The above analysis shows that DNS
manipulation happens. Queries sent to each IP address were
a subdomain instantaneously created, and subsequently ma-
nipulated. As mentioned earlier, one of the purposes of using
subdomain is to prevent caching of results at the open resolver.
In other words, the malicious IP address in the R2 packets we
received does not match the information stored in the cache
of the open resolver, but it is likely to be the result of an
actual but illegitimate response. It is unreasonable to assume
that an attacker applies a cache poisoning to the legitimate
open resolver, because of the short time window, but it is
more plausible to say that the open resolver itself is under
the adversary’s control. It can be assumed that those open
resolvers will work in a way that provides the predetermined
answer which includes the malicious IP address for every
query they receive.
3) DNS Header in Malicious Responses: In addition to the
general analysis, we also provide an analysis of R2 packets
that may mislead the users to malicious IP addresses.
RA and AA Flags. Table X shows the statistics of RA and AA
ﬂags in R2 packets that contain a malicious IP address. With
regard to the RA bit, more than 70% of R2 packets indicate that
the senders are recursion unavailable although the responses
have the dns_answer ﬁeld. On the other hand, about 27%
of R2 packets include the RA bit of 1, which means that the
contained dns_answer ﬁelds are the result from recursive
resolution. However, we already know that the IP addresses in
those R2 packets are malicious and not true, which allows us
to infer that RA bit is used improperly.
We also make several interesting observations from the AA
bit in R2 packets. More than 70% of the responses have a
AA bit of 1, which means that they are from the authoritative
name server. Considering that they were not directly sent to
our authoritative name server, and even they included the
malicious IP address and not true result, the use of AA ﬂag
can be assumed to be a malicious attempt to allude to the
credibility of the response.
Response Code. In the analysis of rcode, we found that all
26,926 R2 packets with malicious IP address have the rcode of
0 (NoError). The use of rcode can also be seen as an intention
to encourage the requester to trust the response and to access
the IP address by claiming a reliability of the answer.
V. DISCUSSION
The Need for Continuous Monitoring of Open Resolvers.
As show in the above analysis, open DNS resolvers still pose
a threat to the Internet. The fact that the number of open
resolvers has declined does not mean that their threat is going
to go away anytime soon. For example, the number of open
resolvers with a malicious behavior has increased, which is
a clear example of the need for steady observation of those
resolvers and the role they play in the DNS ecosystem.
However, and to the best of our knowledge, such a
continuous and steady observation of the open resolvers
on the Internet
is not well performed. For example, one
of the most popular open resolver-related projects is the
openresolverproject.org [4], which shows the number of open
resolvers distributed over the Internet and some ﬂag values
(RA bit or rcode). However, this project but does not provide
