User: I installed homebrew and 
    which python
gives /usr/local/bin/python . However when I type which pip I get/usr/local/bin/pip and not the desired /usr/local/share/python/pip
How do I fix this?
Assistant: For my python 2.7.6 installation:
My pip is installed to: /usr/local/bin/pip
What makes you think it should be installed to /usr/local/share/python/pip? 
Are you seeing a problem when you try and use pip install (whatever)?
