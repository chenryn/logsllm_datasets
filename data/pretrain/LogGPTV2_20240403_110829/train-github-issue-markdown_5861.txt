 **Context**
Local variables (defined with the `#` character at a element attribute) don't
apply for this use case: rqw local variables for a loop with `ngFor`.
In fact, when you define a local variable on an HTML element it corresponds to
the component if any. When there is no component on the element, the variable
refers to the element itself.
Specifying a value for a local variable allows you to select a specific
directive associated with the current element. For example:
will set the instance of the `ngForm` directive associated with the current in
the `name` variable.
So local variables don't allow to set a value created for the current element
of a loop.
If I try to do something like that:
      {{localVariable}}
I have this following error:
    Error: Template parse errors:
    There is no directive with "exportAs" set to "elt.title" ("
        ]#localVariable="elt.title">
        {{localVariable}}
    "): AppComponent@2:10
Angular2 actually looks for a directive matching the provided name `elt.title`
here)... This plunkr shows this:

variables" of this link
http://victorsavkin.com/post/119943127151/angular-2-template-syntax also
describes this.
In addition to the current element of the iteration, `ngFor` only provides a
set of exported values that can be aliased to local variables: `index`,
`last`, `even` and `odd`.
**Question**
It would be interested to have a way to define custom local variables within
the loop. This way you could define a computed variable once and use it
several times in the loop block.
      {{formattedTodoName}}
      (...)
      {{formattedTodoName}}
I would be interested in having your feedbacks.
This question follows the one from the StackOverflow website:

Thanks very much!
