We study the latter two issues in more detail. Figure 5 (Left) plots the cumulative
TCP throughput as a function of ARWND. As a general observation, we note that TCP
throughput increases as ARWND is increased, which is to be expected. First, let’s con-
sider the coupling between the scheduler and TCP. To highlight how this is different
from an arbitrary random channel with some mean rate, we plot throughput obtained
from an ns-2 simulation that has the same parameters as the active experiments ex-
cept that the channel rate was set to the average assigned channel rate inferred from
the CAIT logs. One can clearly see that the simulation predicts a far higher through-
put than that obtained from the experiments (the lowest curve being the one with the

time-stamps option disabled). Quantifying the exact relative impact of random channel
variations (considering the timescale and magnitude of the variations) and coupling
between scheduler and TCP (considering sensitivity of assigned channel rate to buffer
backlog and vice versa) is part of our future work.
The second aspect we mentioned was that oscillations produced by such a cou-
pling could result in highly variable RTT, causing spurious re-transmissions, including
spurious timeouts [6]. To test this hypothesis, we ran experiments where the time-stamp
option was enabled, and thus RTT variability is more accurately captured. Indeed, with
time-stamps, the attained throughput is much higher as shown in Fig. 5 (Left).
Finally, we brieﬂy look at packet losses as a function of window size. Figure 5
(Right) shows that packet losses increase with ARWND. When the window size is
less than the bottleneck buffer at the BSC (25-35KB), all losses are due to the wire-
less channel. For window sizes larger than 35KB, congestion becomes the dominant
cause of packet loss as the packet loss rate curve ﬂattens out.

wireless scheduler’s fairness. Towards this end, we simultaneously downloaded ﬁles
from up to 4 co-located laptops. The experiments were conducted during off-peak hours
to ensure that the only users in the sector were the experiment laptops. In Fig. 6 we plot
the cumulative TCP throughput (Left), as well as the Fairness Gap (Right) as a function
of the number of active users. A perfectly fair scheduler would result in a Fairness Gap
of 0. The larger the gap, the more unfair the scheduler. For any given set of throughput
values (y1, y2,...,yn), the Fairness Gap is deﬁned as:
max(y1, y2, ..., yn) − min(y1, y2, ..., yn)
min(y1, y2, ..., yn)
fgap(y1, y2, ..., yn) =
(2)
As expected, the average throughput achieved per user decreases as the number of
active connections increases. However, we note that the fairness of the scheduler de-
grades with the number of active connections, as reﬂected by a larger Fairness Gap.
Indeed, manual inspection of our experiments indicate that the throughput achieved by
concurrent connections can be highly disparate with typically one user dominating.
The ﬁnal conﬁguration involved evaluating the impact of user mobility and loca-
tion on the connection’s performance. The mobility experiments were conducted on a
30-mile stretch of highway (RT 101) between San Francisco and Palo Alto, during non-
peak hours (i.e., at night). Connections lasted 10-15 minutes which is the time it takes

to download a 5MB ﬁle. A BTS’s coverage area is 2-3 miles causing a 10-15 minute
connection to experience at least two hard hand-offs6, assuming the car’s speed is
45mph. Due to mobility, speciﬁcally path loss and shadowing, the mobile device expe-
riences large variations in channel quality causing Ec/I0 to ﬂuctuate between 0dB (best
possible channel) and -16dB (very poor channel). Figure 7 (Left) shows the achieved
TCP throughput for three different average speeds of 45, 60 and 75 mph, respectively.
Surprisingly, user speed had little impact on TCP throughput indicating that the cellular
network is well engineered for fast hand-offs. We note that mobility is a major concern
in 802.11 networks which are not a priori designed to handle fast transitions.
The last set of experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of average
(long-term) channel conditions. In Section 4 we showed that the short-term scheduler
behavior was not affected by instantaneous variations in channel conditions. However,
it is unclear whether this observation carries over to longer timescales. To investigate
this, we performed two sets of experiments, where the laptop was placed in locations
with either consistently good or bad channels. The average throughput for each location
is plotted in Fig. 7 (Right)7. One can clearly see that the throughput in locations with
better channel conditions (i.e., higher Ec/I0) is much higher. This indicates that the
long-term scheduler behavior is indeed affected by average channel conditions and not
overcome by power control.
6 Conclusions
We conducted a detailed cross-layer measurement study to evaluate TCP behavior over
CDMA2000 networks. The study was conducted under various conﬁgurations that in-
volved simple variations of TCP, as well as, changing user mobility and sector load.
By conducting measurements across all three (i.e., transport, MAC and RF) layers, we
were able to evaluate the system comprehensively. Our main ﬁndings were:
1. The RLP layer allows fast error recovery that almost eliminates packet loss ob-
served at the transport layer, while having a minimal impact on TCP’s RTT.
2. The wireless scheduler in CDMA2000 networks is unaffected by channel condi-
tions or sector load over short timescales. Instead, the decisions are highly depen-
dent on the transport data rate. However, the long-term scheduler rate allocation
is indeed affected by average channel conditions and sector load. Furthermore, in-
creasing sector load deteriorates the fairness of the scheduler.
3. The wireless scheduler and TCP are strongly coupled which can result in highly
variable RTT. Apart from modeling implications since the rate variations are not
completely random, it motivates the need for robust RTT estimation to prevent
spurious re-transmissions.
4. Mobility is well supported in the CDMA2000 network and hence had no major
impact on TCP throughput.
6 A hard hand-off occurs when the BSC completely switches data from one BTS to another.
7 The RTT, general path characteristics and variation in Ec/I0, for both locations, were very
similar.
