User: i want to run a very long working python script, and its hard on the CPU.
there is a way to find out if the user is actively working? (moving mouse and keyboard?)
Edit: running on windows only. priority is not a good idea, still taking a lot of CPU.
Assistant: If you run the script as low priority (nice 20 python foo.py), it will be running all the time, but won't have much of a noticeable impact on higher priority processes (which will be all of them, because 20 is the lowest priority level).
