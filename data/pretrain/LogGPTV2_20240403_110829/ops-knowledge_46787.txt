User: Python.
I've exhausted my research on this topic. I have it running on Windows just fine, but I can't figure out a way to install it on Linux. 
How do I install it on Linux?
Assistant: It looks like an ordinary python package, so just:
pip install --user SimpleGUICS2Pygame
If that gives errors, post them.
