User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Explain to non tech savvy person how to check that your connection to mybank.com is safe? I was reading the security advice given by the Swedish Bankers' Association. They included these two pieces of advice (my translation), that I assume is to teach the user to check for SSL/TLS and protect from SSL-strip:


  
  Check that it is the address of your bank in the address bar of your browser before you log on to your internet bank.
  The web address on the log on page should start with https:// and a padlock symbol should be visible in the browser.
  


This is a fairly important topic, since some Swedish banks serve their main page (where the link to the internet bank is) over HTTP, and none of them have implemented HSTS. However, I see a number of problems with the advice given:


How do I check that it is the adress of my bank? An ordinary user would probably go scanning the URL for the name of the bank, and be satisfied when they find it. So armed only with this advice you would easily fall for mybank.com.evil.com/mybank.com. (Unfortunately the URL for logon pages are often not very clean, so customers would expect a messy URL.)
"So I remember there was something with an h and a couple of p or t or something I should look for. http://? Yeah, that was probably it. Must be safe."
Look for the padlock in the browser? Seriously? You can just include it in the page, don't even need to use the old favicon trick to fool someone reading this advice.


Naturally I started to think about what some actual good advice would be to give on this subject, but I found it surprisingly hard. The advice should be (A) short, (B) easy to remember and understand even for a user with little technical knowledge, and (C) apply to all fairly modern browsers. Imagine you have 30 seconds to explain this to a not very-tech savvy relative.

Any suggestions?

Assistant: Why security indicators fail vs. phishing

There is no action that can be taken that is economically viable. Put another way, it's too effortful to defend against phishing attacks. See 'So long and no thanks for the externalities' for an example on the US economy and information workers.

You are correct that checking for URL correctness is error-prone, and HTTPS passive security indicators are a big joke. They go unnoticed, they have for years been meaningless (what does it mean if the keypad is blue or green or grey!?), and were they to be more prominent / active, people would get habituated to see them and attacks could simply buy a certificate for a rogue URL so that the name checks out.

The solution to this issue must be architectural, rather than rely on wasting the time of humans and on said humans to not make mistakes. Why is it that Web browsers don't have a centralised, trusted repository from which to verify the URLs of banks and reputable payment/transfer websites, so that unique security indicators can be used for such sites?

Solution: make users rely on a secure interaction rather than make them deal with the limitations of indicators

I would tell people to go onto the website once, make sure the URL is correct once (you can help them), and save it in their favourites. And use exclusively the favourites button so they know they are on the right website. I would tell them (without details) that you never know where you'll land when clicking a link or searching for a website but the favourites button always takes you to the right place. How? Doesn't matter.

At this stage, users are guaranteed to land on the correct URL. If an active MITM attack is occurring, they will get the scary certificate warning, which they normally don't have for their banking website. Warning habituation is a very real thing, and figures are missing to determine whether users would pay attention to it in the context of a previously trusted banking website. Improving on this warning (e.g. making it scarier for bank sites) would also require knowledge of what is and isn't a bank's website.
