I noticed that compound assignment won't work with certain operators, like |>
and âˆ˜.
For example, the following code gives the error "ERROR: syntax: unexpected
"="" on line 2:
    a = 2
    a |>= exp 
But if I say, redefine the * operator as |>, it works perfectly:
    import Base.*
    * = |>
    a = 2
    a *= exp
outputs 7.389, as it should. The same thing happens with the function
composition operator. So clearly the language is able to do this, the parser
just doesn't handle it properly with all operators. I tried this in both 0.6.4
and 0.7 and got the same results. Is there some deeper reason why this doesn't
currently work?
