cluding the form of the entities themselves. For example, it is possible that a
service description is considered as possessing the property price only after hav-
ing it passed all quality assurance tests during its production and it has been
committed to by a provider.
In an open-world assumption, functionality and users are not completely ac-
counted for a priori. Hence, a sufficient level of implementation independence
is required from the ontology representation grammar and method. Ontologies
that adopt these approaches will also have more potential for large-scale adap-
tion by a wide variety of software-based service technologies; hence contribute
toagenerativeserviceWeb[34].Thisallentailsadualutilityforourontologies.
Ontological Requirement 4. The adopted KR grammar and method allows
to build a computational ontology that has a dual utility [1]:
– in an IT/IS context, it serves as computer specification to build diverse
semantic applications (such as web services);
– in a business context, it serves as a theoretical model referring to real-world
objects aligning the strategic goals, values, and processes among (human)
stakeholders.
The open-world assumption and dual utility puts additional constraints on new
ways of governance as we will see next.
4 Governance Requirements
The need for ontologies that convey business service semantics to assess aspects
of business services such as regulatory compliance and quality has been hypoth-
esised[29].Onlyrecently,ithasbecomepertinentintheaftermathoftheglobal
financial crisis. Internationally agreed regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley in the
US, and Basel in the EU, enforce strict corporate governance policies that have
primordial impact on the roles and responsibilities among peers in information
management. Yet the issue has been more than often taken lightly as we wit-
ness from at best very poor information governance practice of many networked
industries ranging from financial services to pharmaceuticals (see Gartner, For-
rester and IBM).
In order for business semantics to be useful in the assessment of regulatory
compliance of services, they have to be defined and validated by relevant and
trusted people (usually called data stewards) from very different business func-
tions (ranging from IT to business; with legal and compliance departments in
particular). The industry’s attempt to categorize this GR is labelled as Infor-
mationGovernance9 .GartnerdefinesIGas:“the specification of decision rights
andanaccountabilityframeworktoencouragedesirablebehaviorinthevaluation,
creation, storage, use, archival and deletion of information. It includes the pro-
cesses [actions], roles [actors], standards and metrics [actands] that ensure the
effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve
its goals.” From this definition, we infer our first governance requirement:
Governance Requirement 1. Inordertoaccountforcomplianceandquality,
an SDL-compliant upper ontology should additionally define governance con-
cepts such as actors, roles and competencies.

mdm-institute.com (last accessed on 23/09/2012).
Most scientific papers propose deterministic role patterns and decision domains
with a predefined terminology, and are too much inspired by traditional Data
Quality Management and IT governance [15]. Yet, although best practices for
so-called data stewardship are emerging, we deem it necessary that governance
modelsneedtobeflexibleatrun-time.E.g.,inearlierworkweanalyzedindivid-
ual contributions to an ontology. This behavioral analysis allowed us to identify
user profiles that could lead to a more effective the assignment of roles in the
governance model [7].
Governance Requirement 2. The configuration of roles and responsibilities
among peers in governance of service descriptions must be dynamic.
5 Background in Ontology Representation
fact-oriented ontological analysis In order to accommodate for OR4, we
adopt a fact-oriented approach for the following reasons. Its natural-language
grounding closely relates to speech acts, and therefore it is easier for domain
expertsthemselvestoplayacontributingroleresultinginontologiesthatclearly
and accurately convey realistic business semantics. Furthermore, its attribute-
free approach, as opposed to frame-based techniques (such as UML or ER),
promotes semantic stability under change [14]. Fact-oriented methods include
NIAM/ORM [14].The key of conceptual analysis is to identify relevant object
types, and the roles they play, so we can understand the facts of the business
domain by minimizing the occurrence of lexical ambiguities.
Fact-orientation was repurposed for ontological analysis in the DOGMA
project [20] and further extended with community-driven ontology evolution
support in DOGMA-MESS. Later, Business Semantics Management (BSM) [5]
refinedthismethodbyidentifyingontologyevolutionprocessesandlinkingthem
tocommunityevolutionprocesses(suchasfoundinNonaka’sknowledgeconver-
sion model SECI [21]). BSM is now commercially exploited via Collibra’s Data
Governance Center product10. Fact-orientation is currently also part of OMG’s
Meta-Object Facility for platform-independent modeling of business rules with
modal logic capabilities using the SBVR11 standard.
Ontological analysis seeks further domain abstraction from fact types that
represent different perspectives on the same business concepts. Perspective di-
vergence and convergence are principal mechanisms in BSM to reconcile per-
spectivesthataretakenbydifferentpeopleandarebasedondifferentglossaries,
conceptual hierarchies, and code systems. The result is an ontology that rep-
resents a higher level of abstraction for common domain concepts that can be
appliedforsemantic interoperability [5].BSMiscurrentlylimitedtoonespecific
type, i.e., knowledge-intensive communities that have explicitly set semantic
interoperability requirements (ibid.). In this respect, we cannot claim that we

account for decentralized governance yet. Summarising, BSM has to be repur-
posed for compliance goals of service networks, and its community model has to
be dynamic.
Important activities in BSM are context-driven lexical disambiguation of
termsforconceptsandtheirlinkinginupper-levelconceptualhierarchies[6]and
other types of relationships. Other important considerations in formal ontolog-
ical analysis are essence and rigidity [13]. An entity’s property is essential if it
necessarily holds throughout its lifecycle. A property is rigid if it is essential to
all its instances. This leads to the more advanced notions of identity and unity.
In this paper, we will touch upon these notions when exploiting SBVR’s modal
logic capabilities to impose the possibility or necessity of certain facts about
service systems.
ontology of dynamic entities In order to accommodate for OR3, we adopt
previous work [16] on a conceptual apparatus of an ontology that is designed to
handle the conceptualisation of dynamic entities and the notion of a transient
property.Weillustratedthedesignofapropertypossessionalgebra forconceptu-
alizingthebehaviouroftransientpropertiesacrossthelifecycleofcorresponding

mula may use an SBVR “impossibility” statement12 :
– It is impossible that a Proposal defines a Work Plan if the Pro-
posal has not been submitted or the Proposal has not been accepted.
The fact that the Proposal has not been submitted or accepted is a Circum-
stance that excludes the validity of a Proposal playing the role of defining a
Work Plan.

weprovideanextensionpointtomodelCircumstancesthatallowsfortempo-
ralcausalreasoningaboutresourcepossessionformula.Wefollowafact-oriented
analysis approach by which we abstract elementary fact types based on service
science literature.
Action We first introduce a general notion of action adopted from the For-
mal Framework for Information System Concepts (FRISCO) [10]. We replace a
FRISCO action’s theme/patients called actands with the SDL-compliant con-
cept of (operant and operand) resource.
– Action part of Composite Action/ Composite Action has part Ac-
tion
– Action acted upon by Operant Resource / Operant Resource acts
in Action
– Action acts on Operand Resource / Operand Resource acted upon
in Action
To illustrate modal logic capacities of SBVR, we require an Action to act on
at least one Operand Resource; hence necessitating a certain fact:
– It is necessary that an Action acts on at least one Operand Re-
source
Circumstance We could also link an Action to a triggering external Cir-
cumstance,thatcouldbeeitheraState,Event,orProcess.Distinguishing
between event types is important in the context of temporal causal reasoning as
shown by [30].
– Action guarded by Circumstance / Circumstance guards Action
This makes our definition similar to the artefact-centric approach to service in-
teroperation(ACSI)originallyproposedbyIBMandcurrentlyfurtherdeveloped
(with us) in the likewise called EC-funded project13.
Resource We distinguish between two types of Resource that, in Actions,
playtheroleofeithertheme/patient(Operand)oragent(Operant).Note,in
the rest of this paper we only verbalize one reading direction for fact types:
– Operant Resource is a Resource
– Operand Resource is a Resource

ServiceSystem Maglio[17]definesaServiceSystemasanopensystemthat
is capable of improving the state of another system through sharing or applying
its own Resources; and improving its own state by acquiring external Re-
sources. Its pivotal role also highlights the importance of working systems for
realizing value creation proposed by Alter [2]. We contribute to the latter when
introducing the notion of Competence that will be important for compliance
of service-related Actions. Accordingly, a Service System is an Operant
Resource and can be either a (working) Individual or Organization, the
latter being a composite of Individuals [26].
– Service System is a Operant Resource;
– Service System controls Resource;
– Individual is a Service System (e.g., “John Doe”);
– Organisation is a Service System (e.g., “IG Council”);
– Organisation owns Service System.
The above definition requires that Service Systems see value in having inter-
actions with each other, which brings us to the definition of a Service.
Service A Service is a value co-creating Composite Action constituted by
anumberof interaction eventsinwhichOperant ResourcesofoneSer-
vice System act upon Operand Resources for the benefit of another Ser-
vice System.Whendelivered,aServiceisanEvent(perdurantinDOLCE),
and therefore bound to time and space. We adopt the SDL-compliant Resource-
Service-System model, recently introduced by Poels (ibid.) and is inspired by
the well-known Resource-Event-Agent (REA) model [19]. To indicate the flow
of value, Poels distinguishes between service provider and a service integrator
roles. The economic notion of reciprocity entails a duality in the conception of
Service, resulting in a reflexive “requiting” service in which the integrator and
provider swap their roles. Moreover, economic agent in REA is replaced by the
SDLconceptServiceSystem.WedevisethefollowingfacttypestostateaService
as a special type of Composite Action.
– Service is a Composite Action;
– Service is requited by Service;
– Service provided by Service System;
– Service is integrated by Service System.
Note, in order to reason about value creation, we have to further distinguish
between value-creating interactions and non-value-creating interactions. E.g.,
Poels [26] applied ISPAR conditions in this context. This would open a window
to adopt the benefits from speech act theory as well.
Actor In order to account for our GR1-2, we must introduce additional con-
cepts that have not been considered before in this context. Until now, the se-
mantics of the role of a Resource in a Service was limited to the –economic
