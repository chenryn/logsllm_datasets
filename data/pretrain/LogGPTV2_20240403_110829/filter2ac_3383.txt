### Title: Whispers Among the Stars: A Practical Look at Perpetrating (and Preventing) Satellite Eavesdropping Attacks

**Abstract:**

The landscape of space is rapidly evolving. The number of satellites in orbit is projected to increase from approximately 2,000 today to over 15,000 by 2030, driven by the "New Space" era's promise of ubiquitous broadband and unprecedented global connectivity. As the first mega-constellations begin to take shape, the information security (InfoSec) community has a critical role to play in ensuring that historical security vulnerabilities are not replicated in this new frontier.

This briefing offers an experimental analysis of satellite broadband communication attacks across three domains: land, air, and sea. Our findings reveal that an attacker, using just $300 worth of home television equipment, can eavesdrop on these communications from thousands of miles away with minimal risk of detection. We will detail the hardware and software we utilized to evaluate this threat against real-world systems, focusing on two distinct communication protocols: DVB-S MPE and DVB-S2 GSE.

To contextualize this threat, we analyzed terabytes of real-world satellite traffic recordings captured using our hardware setup. Our analysis uncovered sensitive data from some of the world's largest organizations, including home satellite broadband customers, wind farms, oil tankers, and aircraft. This highlights the critical nature of the privacy and communication security risks posed by satellite eavesdropping. Additionally, we demonstrate that, under certain conditions, attackers can even hijack active sessions over the satellite link.

The presentation concludes with a reflection on the physical characteristics that have contributed to the insecurity of satellite broadband and potential approaches to mitigate these issues. We introduce an open-source tool that individual customers can use to encrypt their traffic without requiring ISP involvement.

**Target Audience:**

This briefing is designed for researchers and professionals with no prior background in satellite communications or cryptography. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive starting point for those interested in addressing the challenging security issues in outer space.
