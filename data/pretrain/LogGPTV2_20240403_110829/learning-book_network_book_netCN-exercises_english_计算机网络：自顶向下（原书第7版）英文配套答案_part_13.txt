## Page 104
a)A's average throughput is given by pA(1-pB).
Total efficiency is pA(1-pB) + pB(1-pA).
b)A’s throughput is pA(1-pB)=2pB(1-pB)= 2pB- 2(pB)2
B’s throughput is pB(1-pA)=pB(1-2pB)= pB- 2(pB)2.
Clearly, A's throughput is not twice as large as B's.
In order to make pA(1-pB)= 2 pB(1-pA), we need that pA= 2  (pA / pB).
c) A’s throughput is 2p(1-p)N-1, and any other node has throughput p(1-p)N-2(1-2p).
Problem 11
a)(1 - p(A))4 p(A)
where, p(A) = probability that A succeeds in a slot
(o sop  pue jou sop  pue ou sop g pue shsuen )d  ()d
= p(A transmits) p(B does not transmit) p(C does not transmit) p(D does
not transmit)
= p(1  p) (1  p)(1-p) = p(1  p)3
Hence, p(A succeeds for first time in slot 5)
(d1)d +(ε（d1)d1)=(v)d t(v)d1)=
b) p(A succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
p(B succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
p(C succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
p(D succeeds in slot 4) = p(1-p)3
p(either A or B or C or D succeeds in slot 4) = 4 p(1-p)3
(because these events are mutually exclusive)
c)p(some node succeeds in a slot) = 4 p(1-p)3
p(no node succeeds in a slot) = 1 - 4 p(1-p)3
Hence, p(first success occurs in slot 3) = p(no node succeeds in first 2 slots) p(some
node succeeds in 3rd slot) = (1 - 4 p(1-p)3)2 4 p(1-p)3
d)efficiency = p(success in a slot) =4 p(1-p)3

Forwarding table in E determines that the datagram should be routed to interface
192.168.3.002.
The adapter in E creates and Ethernet packet with Ethernet destination address 88-
88-88-88-88-88
Router 2 receives the packet and extracts the datagram. The forwarding table in
this router indicates that the datagram is to be routed to 198.162.2.002.
4.
Router 2 then sends the Ethermet packet with the destination address of 33-33-33-
33-33-33 and source address of 55-55-55-55-55-55 via its interface with IP
address of 198.162.2.003.
5. The process continues until the packet has reached Host B.
---
## Page 107
d)ARP in E must now determine the MAC address of 198.162.3.002. Host E sends out
an ARP query packet within a broadcast Ethernet frame. Router 2 receives the query
packet and sends to Host E an ARP response packet. This ARP response packet is
carried by an Ethernet frame with Ethernet destination address 77-77-77-77-77-77.
Problem 15
a)No. E can check the subnet prefix of Host F’s IP address, and then learn that F is on
the same LAN. Thus, E will not send the packet to the default router R1.
Ethernet frame from E to F:
Source IP = E's IP address
Destination IP = F's IP address
Source MAC = E's MAC address
Destination MAC = F's MAC address
b) No, because they are not on the same LAN. E can find this out by checking B’s IP
address.
Ethernet frame from E to R1:
Source IP = E's IP address
Destination IP = B's IP address
Source MAC = E's MAC address
Destination MAC = The MAC address of R1's interface connecting to Subnet 3
c)Switch S1 will broadcast the Ethermet frame via both its interfaces as the received
ARP frame's destination address is a broadcast address. And it learns that A resides
on Subnet 1 which is connected to S1 at the interface connecting to Subnet 1. And, S1
will update its forwarding table to include an entry for Host A.
Yes, router R1 also receives this ARP request message, but R1 won't forward the
message to Subnet 3.
B won’t send ARP query message asking for A’s MAC address, as this address can
be obtained from A's query message.
Once switch S1 receives B’s response message, it will add an entry for host B in its
forwarding table, and then drop the received frame as destination host A is on the
same interface as host B (i.e., A and B are on the same LAN segment).

## Page 108
Problem16
Lets call the switch between subnets 2 and 3 S2. That is, router RI berween subnets 2 and
3 is now replaced with switch S2.
a)No. E can check the subnet prefix of Host F’s IP address, and then learn that F is on
the same LAN segment. Thus, E will not send the packet to S2.
Ethernet frame from E to F:
Source IP = E's IP address
Destination IP = F's IP address
Source MAC = E's MAC address
Destination MAC = F's MAC address
b)Yes, because E would like to find B's MAC address. In this case, E will send an ARP
query packet with destination MAC address being the broadcast address.
This query packet will be re-broadcast by switch 1, and eventually received by Host
Ethernet frame from E to S2:
Source IP = E's IP address
Destination IP = B's IP address
Source MAC = E's MAC address
Destination MAC = broadcast MAC address: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.
c)Switch S1 will broadcast the Ethermet frame via both its interfaces as the received
ARP frame's destination address is a broadcast address. And it learns that A resides
on Subnet 1 which is connected to S1 at the interface connecting to Subnet 1. And, S1
will update its forwarding table to include an entry for Host A.
Yes, router S2 also receives this ARP request message, and S2 will broadcast this
query packet to all its interfaces.
B won’t send ARP query message asking for A's MAC address, as this address can
be obtained from A's query message.
Once switch S1 receives B’s response message, it will add an entry for host B in its
forwarding table, and then drop the received frame as destination host A is on the
same interface as host B (i.e., A and B are on the same LAN segment).
Problem17
Wait for 51,200 bit times. For 10 Mbps, this wait is
10×10°bps
For 100 Mbps, the wait is 512 μ sec.

Problem 18
At 1 = 0 A transmits. At 1 = 576 , A would finish transmitting. In the worst case, B
begins transmitting at time t=324, which is the time right before the first bit of A’s frame
arrives at B. At time t=324+325=649 B 's first bit arrives at A . Because 649> 576, A
finishes transmitting before it detects that B has transmitted. So A incorrectly thinks that
its frame was successfully transmitted without a collision.
Problem 19

A and B finish transmitting jam signal
293+245 = 538
B's last bit arrives at A ; A detects an idle channel
538+96=634
A starts transmitting
293+512 = 805
B returms to Step2
B must sense idle channel for 96 bit times before it
transmits
634+245=879
A's transmission reaches B
Because A's retransmission reaches B before B 's scheduled retransmission time
(805+96), B refrains from transmitting while A retransmits. Thus A and B do not
collide. Thus the factor 512 appearing in the exponential backoff algorithm is sufficiently
large.
