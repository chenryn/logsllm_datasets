User: How to prevent DDoS attacks? Please list the common types of DDoS attacks and explain the preventive measures.
Assistant: DDoS attack refers to a distributed denial of service attack, which means that the attacker uses a large amount of malicious traffic to send requests to the target server at the same time, making it unable to respond to legitimate user requests normally, resulting in service paralysis or even collapse. The following are common DDoS attack types and preventive measures: 1. UDP Flood attack: The attacker sends a large number of UDP data packets to the target server, making it reach the bottleneck in a short period of time and unable to process more requests. Preventive measures: set traffic limit, filter IP address, start UDP traffic monitoring, and reduce UDP external access range. 2. SYN Flood attack: The attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the target server, occupying server resources and slowing down or preventing normal user traffic from reaching the server. Preventive measures: set SYN cookies, reduce TCP waiting queue length, upgrade hardware firewall and intrusion detection system. 3. HTTP Flood attack: The attacker sends a large number of HTTP requests to the target server, making it unable to respond to legitimate user requests, resulting in service paralysis. Preventive measures: Set up HTTP header protection to prevent duplicate requests, use a content delivery network (CDN), use a web application firewall (WAF). 4. ICMP Flood attack: The attacker uses the ICMP protocol to send a large number of requests to consume the network bandwidth and processing power of the target server, as well as interrupt the connection ability of the communication link. Preventive measures: filter out illegal ICMP packets, use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to locate malicious IP addresses, and use traffic analysis tools to detect network anomalies. DDoS attacks have a great impact and threat to Internet security. Users are advised to take comprehensive security measures to protect themselves, such as backing up system data, regularly updating system patches, using firewalls and anti-virus software, and controlling user permissions.
