### Figure 11: Comparison of Encrypted vs. Unencrypted Sessions

- **704,845** Sessions
- **17,501** Addresses
- **18,993,774** Sessions
- **278,337** Hosts

Figure 11 compares the ratio of sessions using unencrypted protocols versus encrypted alternatives, based on whether a session is within the local IP range or reaches globally addressable IPs. The data shows a higher preference for unencrypted protocols in "internal" VSAT traffic. Note that this ratio is expressed on a logarithmic scale.

### Analysis of Sensitive Traffic and Network Participants

Our analysis included members of the Fortune Global 500 and at least six publicly traded entities with combined annual revenues exceeding $700 billion [19]. In the cargo sector alone, we observed sensitive traffic from organizations accounting for more than one-third of all global maritime shipping.

**Key Findings:**
- GSExtract identified over 9,000 distinct hosts belonging to the VSAT network, each participating in 50 or more sessions.
- More than 4,000 hosts participated in at least 500 sessions, and over 400 had publicly accessible IP addresses.
- These numbers suggest that thousands of distinct marine vessels were included in our traffic recordings.
- Due to overhead, latency concerns, and the broadcast nature of satellite communications, VSAT networks typically use static IP address allocations.

### Characterizing the Difficulty of Identifying Ships

While fully automating ship identification based on internet traffic is challenging, an attacker would likely be interested in linking intercepted traffic to physical vessels. To assess this, a random sample of 100 host IP addresses was analyzed, extracting the following metadata:
- Top 10 Source and Destination Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)
- Top 50 TLS Certificate Alternative Names
- Top 50 TLS Subject Common and Object Names
- Top 50 TLS Issuer Common and Object Names
- Top 50 DNS Query Host Names
- First 2,000 Unique 7+ Character Strings Captured

Using this metadata, significant information about individual vessels was gleaned:
- For 62 out of 100 hosts, the data was sufficient to characterize the types of computing devices on board.
- In 17 cases, only the general operating systems (e.g., Windows 10, Android) could be determined.
- Specific software programs and versions were often identifiable, and for three hosts, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports indicated potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
- About a quarter of the analyzed hosts (26) could be tied to specific owners or fleets, allowing an attacker to target specific companies or industries.
- These organizations span eight broad industries across 11 countries, with the largest employing over 70,000 individuals and the smallest operating a single fishing vessel.
- 12 hosts were further associated with specific vessels or, in one case, a remote polar research station.

### Physical Safety and Operations

#### A. Navigation and Charting

Maritime VSAT services provide real-time data for navigation, including vessel locations, optimal routing plans, and nautical charts. Attackers compromising these systems could cause serious harm. For example, altering nautical charts could lead to an oil tanker running aground, causing environmental damage. Similarly, pirates could use intercepted route plans to plan seizures.

- **AIS Positional Traffic:** Over 4 million AIS messages were captured, mostly transmitted from terrestrial web-servers to AIS navigational appliances. If an attacker transmitted additional AIS messages, they could conceal or introduce vessels into charting maps.
- **ECDIS Systems:** ECDIS has replaced paper nautical charts and is vital for safe navigation. However, several ECDIS platforms are vulnerable due to unencrypted updates (e.g., POP3, FTP, HTTP). Implementing the IHO S-63 standard for cryptographic verification would mitigate such attacks.

#### B. Vessel Operations and Security

VSAT connectivity is crucial for various ship operations, and unsecured transmissions can pose security threats. Even seemingly non-sensitive data, like crew manifests, can provide valuable information to pirates. Cargo manifests and other port authority requirements can also reveal targets of interest. For example, we observed a report indicating the transport of hydrogen sulfide, a hazardous material.

### Conclusion

This study highlights the importance of securing maritime VSAT communications to protect both directly networked devices and the physical safety of ships and crews. Future work should focus on robustness against data tampering and the implementation of cryptographic verification standards.
