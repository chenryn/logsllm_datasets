members of the Fortune Global 500 and at least six publicly
traded entities with combined annual revenues exceeding $700
billion [19]. In the cargo sector alone, we observed sensitive
trafﬁc from organizations which, combined, account for more
than one-third of all global maritime shipping.
In total, GSExtract identiﬁed more than 9,000 distinct hosts
belonging to the VSAT network which participated in 50 or
more sessions over the recording window. More than 4,000
participated in at least 500 sessions and more than 400 had
publicly accessible IP addresses. Although ships may occa-
sionally have multiple VSAT terminals aboard, these numbers
suggest that thousands of distinct marine vessels were included
in our trafﬁc recordings. Due to overhead and latency concerns,
and the general broadcast nature of satellite communications,
VSAT networks generally rely on static IP address allocations
(as opposed to, for example, DHCP). As a result, IP addresses

roughly map to physical host routers or devices.
As every ship has distinct technologies aboard, fully au-
tomating the identiﬁcation of ships based on their internet
trafﬁc is likely impossible. However, an attacker would natu-
rally have an interest in linking intercepted trafﬁc to a physical
vessel at sea. In order to characterize the difﬁculty of this task,
a random sample of 100 host IP addresses was selected from
the trafﬁc. The following basic metadata characteristics were
then extracted:

Top 50 TLS Certiﬁcate Alternative Names
Top 50 TLS Subject Common and Object Names
Top 50 TLS Issuer Common and Object Names
Top 50 DNS Query Host Names
First 2000 Unique 7+ Character Strings Captured
Using this basic metadata, it was possible to glean sig-
niﬁcant information about individual vessels. For 62 of the
100 hosts, this data was sufﬁcient to characterize what types
of computing devices might be on board. In some cases
(17), it was only possible to determine the general operating
systems used by devices on board (e.g. Windows 10, Android).
However, one could often determine individual software pro-
grams running on these hosts and even ﬁngerprint speciﬁc
software versions. Indeed, for three of the hosts, Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports were identiﬁed
as likely exploitable against speciﬁc software aboard the ship.
More practically, about a quarter of the analyzed hosts
(26) could be tied to speciﬁc owners or ﬂeets, permitting
an attacker to target speciﬁc companies or industries. These
organizations were spread over eight broad industries: Oil &
Gas, Cargo, Chemical Shipping, Government, Fishing, Subsea
Construction, Maritime Support and Offshore Wind Power.
Moreover,
the companies hail from 11 different countries
(Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Korea, Norway,
Spain, Bermuda, Pakistan, Switzerland, Poland, and Italy).
The largest employs more than 70,000 individuals while the
smallest operates only a single ﬁshing vessel.
12 of these hosts could be further associated to speciﬁc
vessels (or, in one case, a remote polar research station). These
vessels are summarized in Table III and allude to the diversity
of maritime organizations vulnerable to this threat.
Simple extrapolation suggests that, using only cursory
manual analysis, a dedicated attacker could expect to identify
more than 1,000 vessels in the sample trafﬁc collected for this
study. Moreover, this is likely a lower-bound. A deeper manual
review of trafﬁc from a given host may permit an attacker to
identify the associated customer and ship with even greater
reliability (albeit at the cost of increased investigation time).
This experiment was devised with dual purposes. First,
to identify security issues that might endanger the physical
safety of crew and ships using maritime VSAT connections.
Second, to identify less serious but signiﬁcant issues which
might undermine the data privacy and network security of
maritime VSAT customers. While there may be signiﬁcant
overlap between these two categories, we have attempted to
divide our ﬁndings according to each for clarity.

VII. FINDINGS: PHYSICAL SAFETY AND OPERATIONS
Section II notes a signiﬁcant lacuna between prior work
acknowledging the theoretical desire of cyber-attackers to
target maritime vessels and technical research discussing the
mechanism by which such attacks might manifest. Our exper-
imental ﬁndings suggest that attacks against maritime VSAT
communications may be one such mechanism and that securing
maritime VSAT is not just important to protecting directly
networked devices, but also to the wider physical safety of
ship and crew. Speciﬁcally, we consider two targets:
the
navigational and charting systems used to safely route vessels
at sea and sensitive operational information regarding cargo
contents or security procedures aboard a vessel.
A. Navigation and Charting
In the context of ship navigation, maritime VSAT services
are used to provide real time data regarding the location of
other vessels, optimal routing plans, and accurate nautical
charts. These critical operational links have a direct inﬂuence
on the ability of modern vessels to operate safely and reliably.
Attackers who could undermine the reliability of navigational
data aboard their victim’s vessels could cause serious harm
to both their victims and the general public. For example, a
terrorist organization which altered nautical charts to cause
an oil tanker to run aground on a hidden reef would have a
catastrophic environmental impact. Similarly, pirates with the
ability to view, or even alter, planned routes for cargo vessels
could determine an optimal
time and location to attempt
seizure. For example, trafﬁc intercepted from a multi-million
dollar yacht in the trafﬁc captures included detailed itinerary
plans for upcoming destinations.
As mentioned in Section II, there is signiﬁcant interest in
AIS positional trafﬁc. Our trafﬁc captures included more than
4 million AIS messages describing the locations of various
marine vessels. A map of some of these signals can be found in
Figure 12. These messages mostly appeared to be transmitted
from terrestrial web-servers to AIS navigational appliances
aboard various vessels. If an attacker managed to transmit
additional AIS messages on these streams (see Section IX)

with a heavy concentration of reported vessels near the Faroe
Islands. A total of more than 4 million AIS messages were
identiﬁed in the study.
they might maliciously conceal or artiﬁcially introduce vessels
into the charting maps aboard a targeted ship.
It has been previously suggested that attackers might abuse
Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS) to
cause vessels to collide with undersea hazards [27]. However,
to our knowledge, no practical mechanism for attacking such
systems has been identiﬁed to date. ECDIS has come to replace
paper nautical charts on modern vessels and is a vital compo-
nent of safe marine navigation. One of the principle advantages
of modern ECDIS systems compared to paper charts is the
ability to have frequently updated and interactive data enabled
by the use of VSAT connectivity. These updates include critical
safety messages called Notices to Mariners (NMs) which relay
details regarding developing nautical hazards.

is likely trivially vulnerable to the attacks in Section IX.
While every ECDIS product is different, the trafﬁc ob-
served in our study suggests that several commonly used

ECDIS platforms are trivially vulnerable as a result of informa-
tion leakage over maritime VSAT networks. In several cases,
ECDIS chart updates were transmitted over the unencrypted
POP3 e-mail protocol. In many of these instances, ﬁles which
were appropriately named and sent to the correct POP3 in-
box are automatically downloaded and used by the targeted
ECDIS. In other cases, updates must be manually copied by
a crew member onto an external storage device from the e-
mail inbox and inserted into the appropriate ECDIS device
often on a regularly scheduled basis. We also found several
instances in which ECDIS charts were updated via insecure
FTP connections with or HTTP APIs (Figure 13). Were an
attacker to submit maliciously altered ﬁles via any of these
update mechanisms they would be able to alter the nautical
maps used to navigate the victim’s vessel.
A public standard for the cryptographic veriﬁcation of
ECDIS charts exists (IHO S-63) and would mitigate such
attacks [25]. The S-63 standard was developed with the explicit
goal of preventing malware from causing harm to vessels and
is an addition to an older unsecured format (S-57) [24]. S-63
implements a public-key signing system to facilitate client-side
veriﬁcation of chart authenticity and integrity.
Nevertheless, catalog references to more than 15,000 charts
in the unauthenticated S-57 format appeared in our trafﬁc
captures. Moreover, many popular charting services do not use
either the S-57 or S-63 standards but instead use their own
proprietary formats. A cursory inspection of two such vendor-
speciﬁc formats suggested that no cryptographic veriﬁcation
system was employed. For example, Figure 14 depicts an NM
alert which is transmitted via an unsecured web API.
Future systematic work investigating the robustness of
these proprietary formats against data tampering may provide
valuable context for maritime charting customers. Regardless,
these ﬁndings provide a clear practical demonstration of the
importance of employing S-63 or comparable veriﬁcation
standards, even for “air-gapped” or otherwise secured ECDIS
with low risks of malware compromise.
B. Vessel Operations and Security
Beyond navigation and charting, many other aspects of
day-to-day modern ship operations rely on VSAT connectivity
and, in the context of unsecured VSAT transmissions, may
present a security threat to the safety of ship and crew. Even
simple data that does not appear intuitively sensitive, such
as a manifest listing personnel aboard a vessel, can provide

during the experiment indicating the presence of hazardous
materials aboard a vessel.
a dangerous advantage to pirates assessing their ability to
overwhelm the crew of a targeted ship (Figure 15).
The regular transmission of cargo manifests and other
information required by various port authorities could allow
attackers to identify targets of interest. We regularly observed
cargo manifests discussing the contents of vessels, normally in
the form of e-mail attachments or encapsulated in the trafﬁc
of various proprietary ﬂeet management software products. In
one illustrative example, we observed a vessel transmit a report
indicating it was transporting hydrogen sulﬁde (Figure 16).
