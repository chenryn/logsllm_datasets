User: Suppose I have a script written in Python or Ruby, or a program written in C. How do I ensure that the script has no access to network capabilities?
Assistant: You more or less gave a generic answer yourself by tagging it with "sandbox" because that's what you need, some kind of sandbox. Things that come to mind are: using JPython or JRuby that run on the JVM. Within the JVM you can create a sandbox using a policy file so no code in the JVM can do thing you don't allow.
For C code, it's more difficult. The brute force answer could be to run your C code in a virtual machine with no networking capabilities. I really don't have a more elegant answer right now for that one. :)
