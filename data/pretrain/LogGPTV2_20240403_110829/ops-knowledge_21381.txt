Subject: Assistance Required: Resolving "Error" Status for Indexes in App Engine

Dear Support Team,

I have a Java application deployed on Google App Engine, and I use the `appcfg.py` tool from the Python SDK to manage and update my indexes. Yesterday, I encountered an issue while performing index management tasks.

Initially, I ran the `vacuum_indexes` command, which successfully enqueued tasks to delete my existing indexes. However, I then mistakenly ran the `update_indexes` command before the previous indexes were fully deleted. As a result, the `update_indexes` call failed, and now all my indexes are showing a status of "Error" in the App Engine console.

It has been over 24 hours since the error occurred, and the status of my indexes remains unchanged. I am seeking assistance to resolve this issue.

Steps I have taken so far:
1. Emptied the `index.yaml` file (after creating a backup).
2. Ran `vacuum_indexes` again.
3. Monitored the App Engine admin console to ensure all indexes were deleted.
4. Specified the desired indexes in the `index.yaml` file.
5. Ran `update_indexes`.
6. Checked the App Engine admin console, which now shows that the indexes are building.

Despite these steps, I am still experiencing issues. Any additional guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Keyur

P.S.: I have also posted this query on the Google App Engine forums, but I am hoping that Stack Overflow users may have encountered and resolved similar issues.
