### 4.3 Effects of Network Size

The total number of devices in the network is a critical parameter. We simulated our worm on various network sizes to observe how the propagation speed changes as the network size grows, while keeping the device density constant. We varied the device densities in the network between 0.0356 devices/m² (dense) and 0.0089 devices/m² (sparse). The mean speed in the random waypoint model was also varied between 1 and 3 meters per second. The results, including 95% confidence intervals, are presented in Figure 4. This figure shows the average propagation times for 50% and 95% infection coverage as a function of network size under four scenarios. In all cases, both times grow linearly with the network size, except for the scenarios with a mean speed of 3 m/s and low density, which show slightly sub-linear growth. We used least squares linear regression to fit the simulation results, and the derived linear curves are depicted in Figure 4. The observed linearity allows us to extrapolate worm propagation times in Bluetooth networks at scales beyond current simulation capabilities. For example, consider a network with one million Bluetooth devices in a 108 m² area, which has almost the same device density as the aforementioned sparse scenarios. If we assume that all devices are vulnerable to worm infection and move according to the random waypoint model at a mean speed of 1 m/s, using the slopes derived from Figure 4, we can infer that it would take approximately 10 days for the worm to infect half of the population and 17 days to infect 95% of all the devices.

### 5. Dynamics Analysis

In the previous section, we presented how Bluetooth worms propagate under various scenarios. In this section, we provide a more detailed analysis of the dynamics unique to Bluetooth worm propagation. We conducted two new sets of experiments, both simulating a network with 200 Bluetooth devices in a 75m × 75m area. In the first set, devices remain stationary throughout the simulation, and in the second set, devices move according to the random waypoint mobility model. In each experiment, we randomly chose a Bluetooth device and let it be infected at the beginning of the simulation.

#### 5.1 Results for Static Devices

We simulated the static network for 300 seconds. Every device in the network is susceptible to the worm infection. We performed 10 sample runs, in each of which devices were randomly distributed in the area (we discarded those that did not yield a fully connected network).

**Propagation Curve:**
For ease of explanation, we define \( T_{p\%} \) as the time in seconds needed to infect \( p \) percent of the devices in the network. Figure 5 presents the cumulative numbers of infected devices as a function of simulation time in three sample runs. These sample runs were selected based on their \( T_{50\%} \): the one with the smallest value, the one with the largest value, and the one with the median value. We also plotted the curve that averages all the sample runs. From the graph, we observe that there exists a consistent pattern in the propagation dynamics.
