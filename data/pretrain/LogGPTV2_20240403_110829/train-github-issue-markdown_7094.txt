When using `@Valid` to drive automatic validation of a model object, it is
currently not possible to modify the bound model object prior to validation.
With the SimpleFormController hierarchy it was straightforward to override
BaseCommandController's onBind() or onBindAndValidate() methods to achieve
custom binding; however, with `@MVC` it is currently not possible. Neither the
WebBindingInitializer API nor an `@InitBinder` method provides a mechanism to
plug in custom binding.
Note that this was not an issue prior to support for `@Valid`, since without
`@Valid` developers were responsible for executing validation code within a
handler method.
One possible solution would be to add support for an `@PostBinding` method or
`@PreValidation` method (or similar) which would be allowed to modify the
model after binding but prior to executing the handler method.
