User: I just downloaded and installed Anaconda on my Windows computer. However, I am having trouble executing .py files using the command prompt. How can I get my computer to understand that the python.exe application is in the Anaconda folder so it can execute my .py files?
Assistant: Anaconda should add itself to the PATH variable so you can start any .py file with "python yourpythonfile.py"  and it should work from any folder. 
Alternatively download pycharm community edition, open your python file there and run it. Make sure to have python.exe added as interpreter in the settings.
