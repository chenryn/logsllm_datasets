Lemma 1. Let Z = ID − 8. When ρD = 1, Z follows a
Poisson distribution with the mean of 8 time units.
Proof. One component of ID is the transmission time of
packets P1 and P2 at queue QD, which is 2 × 120/30 = 8
time units. The other component of ID is the (discretized)
transmission time of the cross-traﬃc packets that arrive be-
tween P1 and P3 at QD, denoted as Z. Then Z = ID − 8.
By the M/D/1 queue assumption, Z follows a Poisson dis-
tribution. Furthermore, since the inter-arrival time of P1
and P3 at QD is 2 × 120/30 = 8 time units, on average, 8
cross-traﬃc packets arrive between P1 and P3 at QD. This is
because, given ρD = 1, the arrival rate of cross-traﬃc pack-
ets at QD is 1 packet per time unit, equal to the processing
rate. Therefore, the mean of Z is 8 time units.
Lemma 2. Suppose ID = x time units. When ρA = 1,
the conditional distribution of IA given ID follows a Poisson
distribution with the mean of x time units.
Proof. From Fig. 2(a), IA is the same as the inter-departure
time of ACKs A1 and A3 at queue QA. Since we assume
no other traﬃc between the router and the receiver, the
inter-arrival time of A1 and A3 at queue QA is the same
as ID. Therefore, given that ID = x time units, the num-
ber of cross-traﬃc packets arriving between A1 and A3 at
queue QA follows a Poisson distribution with the mean of
x time units (following a reasoning similar to the proof for
Lemma 1). Therefore, the conditional distribution of IA
given ID = x follows a Poisson distribution with the mean
of x time units.

We now proceed to prove Theorem 1.

Under this condition, from Lemma 3, by direct calculation,
we have P (IA > 20) = P (∆A > 600 µs)  600 µs)  1/2.

Hence g(n, q) is an increasing function of q, 0 ≤ q ≤ 1.

is an increasing function of q for 0 ≤ q ≤ 1. By Theorem 1,
we know u > 1 − 0.18 = 0.82. Therefore, we have g(n, u) ≥
g(n, 0.82). Hence, P (ξn
.5(∆A) ≤ 600 µs) ≥ g(n, 0.82). By
direct calculation, we have P (ξn

43 ≤ n ≤ 100. Furthermore, since 0.82 > 1/2, by Lemma 4,
we have limn→∞ P (ξn
.5(∆A) ≤ 600 µs) = 1.
C. PROOF OF THEOREM 3
Before proving Theorem 3, we ﬁrst state a lemma that is
used in the proof.
Lemma 5. Let ∆D
i,i+1 represent the inter-arrival time of
data packets Pi and Pi+1 at the AP, i = 1, 2, 3. Then
P (∆D
i,i+1  P (I D
ρD  600 µs)
= P (∆A > 600 µs | C)P (C) + P (∆A > 600 µs | ¯C)P ( ¯C)
≥ P (∆A > 600 µs | C)P (C) ≈ P (∆A > 600 µs | C)
We now derive P (∆A ≤ 600 µs | C). To satisfy ∆A ≤ 600
µs, no data packet can be transmitted between A1 and A3,
since the transmission time of a data packet is at least 1570
µs. Therefore, only the following two sequences are possible:
P2P3A1A3P4 and P2P3P4A1A3.
We ﬁrst derive the probability that the ﬁrst sequence oc-
curs given condition C. Since P2 arrives at the AP before the
AP ﬁnishes transmitting P1, the receiver and the AP con-
tend for the wireless channel: the receiver needs to transmit
ACK A1 (which is generated corresponding to packet P1)
while the AP needs to transmit packet P2. Let φ denote
the probability that A1 obtains the channel earlier than P2.
Since this probability can be aﬀected by many factors (e.g.,
the timing when A1 reaches the MAC layer, when packet
P2 can be transmitted), we assume φ can take any value in
[0, 1]. When P2 transmits earlier than A1, A1 will contend
with packet P3 for the wireless channel.
In this case, we
assume that A1 and P3 are equally likely to win the con-
tention, since they can both be transmitted immediately.
To summarize, the probability that P2 and P3 are earlier
than A1 is (1 − φ) × 1/2, the probability that A1 and A3 are
earlier than P4 is 1/2 × φ (for similar reasons as described
earlier). Therefore, the probability that the ﬁrst sequence
occurs given C is (1 − φ) × 1/2 × 1/2 × φ = φ(1 − φ)/4.
For the second sequence, the probability of having P2 and
P3 earlier than A1 is (1 − φ) × 1/2; the probability that P4
is earlier than A1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that the
second sequence occurs is (1 − φ) × 1/2 × 1/2 = (1 − φ)/4.
In both sequences, to satisfy ∆A ≤ 600 µs, we also re-
quire the MAC service time of A3 to be less than 600 µs.
The probability of this condition being satisﬁed is (600 −
508)/620 = 92/620. Therefore,
P (∆A ≤ 600 µs | C) = [φ(1 − φ)/4 + (1 − φ)/4]92/620

D. PROOF OF THEOREM 4
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3. Let
C denote the condition that ∆D
i,i+1 ≤ 325 µs, i = 1, 2, 3.
Under this condition, Pi+1 arrives at the AP before the AP
ﬁnishes transmitting Pi, since the MAC service time of a
data packet is at least 325 µs in 54 Mbps 802.11g. Then
assuming independence and from Lemma 5, P (C) ≥ 0.893.
We now obtain P (∆A ≤ 600 µs | C). To satisfy ∆A ≤
600 µs, there can be at most one data packet transmit-
ted between ACKs A1 and A3, since the minimum trans-
mission time of two data packets and one ACK exceeds
600 µs. This constraint leads to the following four pos-
sible sequences: P2P3A1A3P4, P2P3P4A1A3, P2A1P3A3P4,
and P2P3A1P4A3. The ﬁrst two sequences are the same as
those in the proof of Theorem 3. They occur with respec-
tively the probabilities of φ(1 − φ)/4 and (1 − φ)/4, where
φ is the probability that ACK A1 transmits earlier than P2.
Following a similar reasoning as that in the proof of The-
orem 3, the probability that the third sequence occurs is
(1−φ)×1/2×1×φ = φ(1−φ)/2, and the probability that the
last sequence occurs is (1 − φ) × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = (1 − φ)/8.
For the ﬁrst two sequences, we have ∆A ≤ 600 µs. For
the third sequence, to satisfy ∆A ≤ 600 µs, we need the
total MAC service time of P3 and A3 to be below 600 µs.
Similarly, for the fourth sequence, to satisfy ∆A ≤ 600 µs,
we need the total MAC service time of P4 and A3 to be
below 600 µs. Let X and Y denote respectively the MAC
service time of a data packet and an ACK. Then for both the
third and the fourth sequences, we need X +Y ≤ 600 µs. Let
α = P (X +Y ≤ 600 µs). As described in Section 3.4, X and
Y are uniformly distributed in [325, 460] µs and [109, 244]
µs, respectively. Then, by a standard technique, we have
α = 0.70. Hence
P (∆A ≤ 600 µs | C)
= φ(1 − φ)/4 + (1 − φ)/4 + αφ(1 − φ)/2 + α(1 − φ)/8
= (−87718φ2 + 38451φ + 49267)/145800 ≤ 0.37.
Therefore, P (∆A > 600 µs) ≥ P (∆A > 600 µs | C)P (C) >
(1 − 0.37) × 0.893 = 0.45.
