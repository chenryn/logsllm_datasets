### Model description
LayoutLMv3 is a pre-trained multimodal Transformer for Document AI with
unified text and image masking. The simple unified architecture and training
objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-purpose pre-trained model. For example,
LayoutLMv3 can be fine-tuned for both text-centric tasks, including form
understanding, receipt understanding, and document visual question answering,
and image-centric tasks such as document image classification and document
layout analysis.
LayoutLMv3 greatly simplifies training and reduces the number of parameters
compared to v3, making it an important milestone in document understanding.
