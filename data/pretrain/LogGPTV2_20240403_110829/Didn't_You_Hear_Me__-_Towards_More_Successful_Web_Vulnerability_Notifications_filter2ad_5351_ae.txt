### Manual Notification Effort and Cost

Despite the significant effort, manual notifications yielded a relatively low success rate. Using the most effective channels—postal and phone for Git, and social media and phone for WordPress—we managed to reach a slightly higher fraction of reports compared to our regular notification campaign. However, it remains unclear how to determine the best alternative channel in advance.

The cost of this notification was substantial:
- **Time**: Approximately 60 hours of work (40 hours to look up contacts for all 970 domains, 10 hours for phone calls, 5 hours for letters, and 5 hours for social network and web forms).
- **Postage and Telephone Costs**: Additional expenses were incurred.
- **Returned Letters**: Out of 67 letters sent, 18 were returned due to non-existent recipients.

Given these factors, we argue that such a manual notification process is not cost-efficient when trying to notify a large number of sites.

### VI. Survey Analysis

Following our automated and manual notifications, we sent anonymous surveys (available in our GitHub repository [1]) to all notification recipients who did not opt out of our experiments, as described in Section II-D. Here, we analyze the responses and distill the insights they provide.

#### A. Summary of Survey Submissions

We distributed a distinct survey to each notification response group, allowing us to track anonymous survey answers per response group. The sets of questions for each survey were identical, except for an additional question for groups that did not fix the vulnerability, asking for the reasons they did not address the issue. All survey questions were optional, typically resulting in fewer question answers than submitted surveys.

Across our six response groups, we received:
- **Total Submitted Surveys**: 193
- **Initiated but Not Submitted Surveys**: 232

The submissions were primarily from two response groups:
- **REPORT FIXED (Viewed and Fixed Vulnerability)**: 162 submissions (plus 150 other views)
- **NOREAD NOFIX (Did Not View Email and Did Not Fix)**: 27 submissions (plus 59 incomplete ones)

The remaining response groups provided two or fewer submissions, with 12 or fewer total views. These low reply rates are surprising, given that some response groups include those who viewed our report website or opened the notification message, indicating active email addresses. Despite randomizing the order of sent emails and regularly checking for IP blacklists, our messages containing a link to the survey page might have been detected as spam by mail servers, particularly Google’s mail servers.

#### B. Respondent Demographics

Respondents were asked to self-describe the type of website their organization maintains and the nature of their organization. The most popular response was that the website was a corporate or business homepage:
- **REPORT FIXED Group**: 66 out of 162 (33.3%)
- **NOREAD NOFIX Group**: 6 out of 27 (22%)

This indicates that the exploitation of website vulnerabilities may have financial implications, potentially compromising businesses or harming their customers. Other notable website categories included personal or blog pages, e-commerce websites, community forums, online services, and academic institution homepages, although none of these categories accounted for more than 7% of respondents.

#### C. Security Response Manpower

The availability of security personnel impacts the effectiveness of security notifications. We asked respondents to disclose the number of personnel tasked with responding to security incidents or notifications, as well as the number of people directly responsible for administrating or maintaining the website.

- **Security Administrators**:
  - 1 person: 92 websites (53%)
  - 2-5 people: 66 websites (38%)
  - No one: 9 websites (5%)
  - 5+ people: 6 websites (3%)

- **Webmasters**:
  - 2-5 people: 101 websites (58%)
  - 1 person: 56 websites (32%)
  - No one: 2 websites (1%)
  - 5+ people: 14 websites (8%)

#### D. Acceptability of Detection and Notification

Understanding the acceptability of our vulnerability scans and subsequent notifications is crucial. We asked respondents if they found it acceptable to detect security issues on their website and if it was acceptable for us to notify them about any detected problems. We also asked if they would find such notifications useful in the future.

- **Detection Allowed**: 178 out of 181 (98.3%)
- **Notifications Unacceptable**: 1 out of 185 (0.5%)
- **Future Notifications Useful**: 181 out of 183 (98.9%)

These nearly universally positive responses suggest that our notifications are well-received. We also received numerous thanks in the survey’s free response comments, aligning with prior studies [13, 19] which reported positive interactions with the vast majority of notification recipients.

#### E. Proper Points of Contact

Our notification efforts highlighted the challenges in establishing contact with site maintainers. We inquired about the best points of contact and observed a wide range of responses:

- **WHOIS Technical Email**: 123 respondents
- **Site-Listed Emails**: 115 respondents
- **WHOIS Abuse Contact**: 59 respondents
- **Web Forms**: 55 respondents
- **Other Options (Social Media, Snail Mail, Phone Numbers)**: 15-25 respondents

This range of responses highlights the difficulty in reliably reaching the appropriate webmaster and provides guidance for future notification efforts, such as using emails scraped from websites or automating web form submissions. The popularity of the WHOIS technical email over the WHOIS abuse contact is noteworthy, countering the intuition used in prior studies [6, 13, 19, 25, 26].

#### F. Trust as a Factor

Our survey questions aimed to assess the qualities and characteristics of our notification messages. A common theme was trust in the notification. Many recipients initially dismissed our message as untrustworthy and only heeded it after investigation. Three common characteristics impacting trustworthiness were:

1. **Message Sender**: 14 submissions explicitly stated the sender was unfamiliar or lacked a trustworthy reputation. Some suggested building a reputation or using a trusted brand.
2. **Use of External Links**: Email links, especially from unknown senders, can appear suspicious. One respondent advised against linking to external sites, suggesting that the entire vulnerability report should be included in the message.
3. **Similarity to Phishing or Spam Emails**: 10 recipients found our notification in their spam folders. Several mentioned past experiences with less benevolent parties, highlighting the need to distinguish our notifications from spam and phishing messages.

### VII. Future Directions for Vulnerability Notifications

While a significant fraction of notified domains corrected the issues, many remained unfixed. Our survey responses indicated a strongly positive reception to our efforts. However, research into large-scale security notifications is still in its infancy. We outline challenges and potential areas for future work:

#### A. Better Delivery Mediums

Most works related to large-scale notifications face similar technical hurdles, particularly in identifying appropriate email addresses. We faced high bounce rates, especially for generic aliases like security@. Even though we could extract contact information from WHOIS entries, these sometimes pointed to internet registrars or hosting providers.

#### B. Design and Content of Notification Messages

Future work should focus on the design and content of notification messages, emphasizing the establishment of trust. Potential solutions include more professionally designed or HTML-based messages and a subscription model where webmasters can subscribe to vulnerability notifications.

By addressing these challenges and improving the delivery and design of notifications, we can enhance the effectiveness of vulnerability notifications and better protect websites and their users.
