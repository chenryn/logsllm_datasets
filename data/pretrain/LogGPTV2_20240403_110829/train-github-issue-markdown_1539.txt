It may be possible to manage variables using reference tags and specify them through compiler options. For example, consider files structured as follows:

```typescript
/// <reference path="pathProjectA" />
/// <reference path="pathProjectB" />
```

You can then use the TypeScript compiler with options like this:

```sh
tsc ... --var pathProjectA=... --var pathProjectB=...
```

This approach is related to the migration discussed in [TypeScript CodePlex Work Item 1414](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1414).
