Abstract 
Industrial control systems are flexible constructs that result in increased efficiency and 
profitability, but this comes at the cost of vulnerability. In past years, industrial cyber security 
has been mostly ignored due to cost, lack of understanding, and a low incidence rate. More 
and more these systems rely on commercial, off the shelf software which increases the ease 
and likelihood of an attack. Today, we face growing threats from individuals, foreign 
governments and competing companies. The risks have increased by orders of magnitude. 
This paper will provide an overview of control components common to the power 
industry, common vulnerabilities, and the current situation with industry’s cyber infrastructure 
as well as worst case scenarios. This paper provides a short overview of standards and 
governances followed by recommendations to facilitate achieving compliance with overlapping 
governances.

Preface 
Over the course of the last forty years, modern industrial plants have come to rely more 
and more on complex networking and computing to automate and monitor processes within 
the plant.  This reliance on automated control has brought with it exponential increases in 
efficiency, quality of product, safety, as well as many other advantages.  Unfortunately, it also 
brings with it vulnerabilities which can be exploited, either intentionally or unintentionally. This 
can lead to loss of revenue, damage to equipment, injury, or even fatalities.  With this in mind, 
modern plant control systems must be designed with security as a primary goal. 
As with any other type of technology, industrial controls technology is constantly 
changing and evolving.  New vulnerabilities are discovered at a rate which software and 
hardware developers cannot keep up.  Therefore the objective of a good security plan is not to 
anticipate every possible type of attack, but instead to make systems more difficult to 
compromise, particularly at the point of entry. A high-quality defense-in-depth strategy will 
minimize the amount of damage any successful attack is able to do. 
The aim of this paper will be to examine the current state of industrial automation 
defense.  It will look at current common vulnerabilities and real cases of intrusion into the 
control networks of operating plants.  It will then examine the various existing standards and 
requirements for security of a power plant.  Using these as a basis, an efficient method to 
implement a security plan which will comply with each of these overlapping standards while 
executing an effective security strategy will be proposed. 
Although this paper will focus mainly on the power industry, the same methods are valid 
for nearly any type of large industrial plant.  Most of the components are identical in function 
and design.

1. Introduction to Process Networks and Industrial Cyber Security 
1.1.  Typical Control Hierarchy 
A control system is typically described by levels of control, with the lowest levels 
corresponding to the most basic levels of control.  Understanding this design method is 
important because often times the Electronic Security Perimeters (ESPs) will mirror the 
division of these levels; ESPs are discussed in section  4.4.2.1.  Because each level of 
control in a plant has a different level of criticality to the overall operation of the plant, as 
well as different vulnerabilities to the various types of cyber attacks, varying types and 
levels of security will apply.  Because of this, it is important for the security plan to control 
how and if one level of control is able to communicate with another level of control. 
A typical industrial plant will have several discrete levels in its control system.  There 
exist several standard methods for describing each level.  The one used here is the one 
proposed in ISA standard 88.01 section 4.2. 
The lowest level of control is the Control Module Level.  This level describes basic input 
and output (I/O) devices such as sensors (e.g. pressure, flow rate, temperature, turbidity, 
etc.) and control devices (e.g. valves, motors, solenoids, burner controls, etc.) fundamental 
to the power generation process in the field.  The amount of intelligence is typically very 
limited at this level, though some new smart devices are changing this trend. 
Above the Control Module Level is the Equipment Module Level which performs basic 
monitoring and control functions with input from and feedback to the Control Module Level 
equipment.  The equipment at this level can detect and respond to emergencies within its 
area of control, usually by monitoring for conditions outside of the normal ranges of 
operation.  A programmable logic controller (PLC) or distributed control system (DCS) is 
usually found at this level. Occasionally, a single loop controller (SLC) can be found within 
this level. 
  Supervisory control and coordination functions between the various Equipment Module 
Level hardware is performed by the Unit Level.  The Unit Level is usually made up of 
modules that together perform a specific task within the overall process.  Supervisory 
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are often found at this level, though more 
and more the distinction between a DCS and a SCADA system has become blurred and 
they are used nearly interchangeably. 
The top level which spans the entire process is called the Process Cell Level which is 
comprised of all the Unit Level hardware.  The Process Cell Level is particularly important 
in the coordination of an emergency, including one potentially caused by a hostile attack, 
as it would coordinate the emergency action plan of all the levels below it. 
The remaining 3 levels, Area Level, Site Level and Enterprise Level, are part of the 
business network, which is split by organizational requirements.  A Demilitarized Zone

separating these levels from the plant control levels is perhaps one of the most important 
security precautions as usage and security within these levels is more relaxed then it is 
within the lower levels of control1

1.2.  Common Internal Connections 
With a basic understanding of the control hierarchy of an industrial plant, the complexity 
of communication between hardware at each level is apparent.  Communication at the 
lowest levels consists of field devices providing information in the form of a simple analog 
or digital signal to a controller.  From the device end this is accomplished with either a 
digital signal, like in the case of a switch, or an analog signal which provides a continuous 
measurement, such as pressure or temperature.  More complex methods of communication 
also exist at this level and are becoming very common in a plant setting.  Protocols like 
Profibus and Foundation Fieldbus allow additional information to be transmitted on the 
same medium.  This will be discussed in more detail at a later time.

The controller end of the lowest level usually consists of a PLC or DCS.  PLCs use 
ladder or Boolean logic to produce control outputs based on inputs received from the field.  
DCSs use computers combined with graphics to interpret inputs in a more flexible way than 
PLCs and can perform several functions in parallel.2
Because all connections at this level are internal, security measures should focus on 
internal threats as well as segmentation.  Access to the control system should be limited 
and monitored.  Equipment should be enclosed and physically secured where appropriate.  
A true defense-in-depth approach should also protect the lower levels from failures that 
occur at levels higher levels.  This is accomplished through the use of firewalls, data diodes, 
and other devices which control and restrict the flow of information between hardware, as 
discussed in section  4.4.2.3, Protection of cyber devices 
1.3.  Common External Connections 
At higher levels of the control architecture, connections to external networks typically 
become more common.  Most of these connections are intended, at least in an ideal world, 
and usually required for plant operation.  Unintended connections, like unsecured wireless 
connections must be avoided at all costs.  Wireless communication in an industrial setting 
should be avoided in general, and only implemented when other options are not practical 
and only on non-critical systems.  Extra precautions should be implemented on wireless 
devices including data protections like complex encryption and hard authentication; multi-
band frequency hopping should be used for transmission security and hardware protections, 
of course, are required. Consider adjusting radio power and using directional antennas. 
Intentional external connections are often connections to plant business networks, grid 
networks or, on rare and dangerous occasions un-trusted zones like an enterprise networks 
or even the web.  These external connections typically allow information on plant operation 
and output to be sent outside of the plant control system for production analysis, scheduling, 
maintenance, load determination and other purposes.  Often, external connections go to 
networks that are used by personnel untrained in recognizing potential security dangers.  
Because of the intended use of networks such as the business network, and the fact that it 
is not considered a critical application from a generation standpoint, the level of security is 
much lower and the incidence of exposure to external networks and the internet is much 
higher.  A combination of these factors makes this network a likely and often easy target for 
a cyber attack, and navigation to plant networks may be easier than expected.  Care must 
be taken to secure the connection between these two networks to ensure data only flows 
as intended, in the direction intended.  Methods for doing this will be discussed in detail in 
section  4.4.2.2 Protection of ESP Access Points.  Care must also be taken to ensure that 
data only flows through the intended connection points from one network to the other.  A 
fortuitous connection could easily allow unhindered access to the plants control system.  
For this reason, connections between the two networks should be limited to as few 
segments as possible, and those segments should be carefully monitored.

Because the lifespan of an industrial plant can span upwards of forty years or longer, 
hardware and software must be kept up to date as technology evolves.  Additionally, as 
parts of a plant are upgraded or as new sections are added, it is important that the change 
management process is followed carefully so that additional connections can be tracked 
and monitored. 
1.4.  Protocols 
Many communications protocols exist in a modern industrial plant.  Currently, there is 
no general agreement on a standard of communication, and as a result several competing 
standards perform nearly the same function.  It is a matter of preference which 
communication philosophy is chosen.  Many protocols have versions of the protocol 
appropriate for both the device level of control as well as communication at higher levels of 
the control architecture; hardware and software considerations are usually included during 
the design of these versions.  Examples of this include Serial MODBUS at the device level 
and MODBUS TCP at the controller level, PROFIBUS PA at the device level and 
PROFIBUS DP at the controller level.  Foundation Fieldbus, a very common protocol, is an 
open Fieldbus standard which also comes in two levels, H1 for device level communication 
and HSE for communication between controllers. 
There are several other common protocols worth mentioning here.  HART protocol 
allows analog devices to transmit additional information over the common 4-20 mA analog 
instrument signal by shifting the frequency of the signal; this allows instrumentation to 
continue operating while a user communicates with the device.  Devicenet is another 
communication protocol at the device level which allows several devices to be daisy-
chained together brought back to the controller on one pair of wires.3
Another standard worth mentioning here is the OLE for Process Control (OPC) data 
access standard.  OPC is an open standard governing the communication of data between 
a device in the field and control equipment.  This allowed devices which supported the OPC 
standard to communicate with any type of control equipment which also supported this 
standard with no additional interface required. 
When choosing a protocol for plant communication, one must keep in mind that all 
devices and controllers must be compatible with that protocol to minimize cost and 
confusion.  Because this is not always practical, bridges and converters exist to allow more 
than one protocol to be used within a discrete network. When deciding what level of the 
control hierarchy to protect and to what degree, protocols are often use as the deciding 
factor.

2.  Hazards and Risks to Operability 
2.1.  Industrial Cyber Security Incidents 
The realities of the current situation with the industrial security infrastructure are bleak.  
In general, control system design has not kept pace with the rest of the IT industry in terms 
of security and the result is the state of affairs currently faced by Control System Engineers.  
Part of the problem is owed to the fact that, although many plants are designed to last 40 
years, the life span of many industrial plants can far exceed forty years.  At their time of 
design, cyber attacks were a non-existent threat and safeguards were not built into the 
design of the control system.  Without a well established and documented security plan, 
including policies for change management, these aging control systems are often modified 
with new undocumented and insecure ad-hoc connections which can compromise the 
overall security of the plant.  This situation, combined with a dramatic increase in attacks 
driven by monetary and political motivators leaves all sectors of national infrastructure 
including water, power, and manufacturing vulnerable to devastating attacks. 
To understand the urgency of this situation, one needs to look no further then President 
Obama’s Commission on Cyber Security which is quoted as saying “America’s failure to 
protect cyberspace is one of the most urgent national security problems facing the new 
administration.”4  This realization of the current state of affairs led to an early 2009 review 
of the current state of affairs and efforts to shore up the nations vital networks.  The review 
highlighted a 10 item near-term action plan which included appointing a governmental 
policy official tasked with coordinating national cyber security efforts, a position later 
dubbed the “cyber czar”.  Other items on the action plan included making cyber security a 
national priority with measurable performance metrics to track progress and creating a 
nation-wide cyber security awareness campaign.5
For fairly obvious reasons, publicly available detailed reports of industrial cyber security 
incidents are not common.  In 2009 the United States government confirmed that the US 
power infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber attacks.6  Sources report that there had been 
many intrusions into different plants across the country, sometimes leaving behind software 
which could be used to take over or disable the system at a later time.  Another CIA official 
reported that there have been multiple cases of cyber attacks on power plants outside the 
US in some cases followed by extortion demands.6
One such case of a targeted intrusion occurred in 2001 at a California utility responsible 
for electric transmission.  The invasion went undetected for nearly 20 days as attackers 
gained access to a portion of the utility’s system that was under development through an
