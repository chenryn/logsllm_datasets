### Semi-Structured Data

Semi-structured data is organized into entities, where similar entities are grouped together. However, entities within the same group may not share the same attributes. The order of these attributes is not necessarily important, and not all attributes may be required. Additionally, the size and type of the same attributes within a group can vary.

**Example: Curriculum Vitae (CV)**
A CV is an excellent example of semi-structured data. One person's CV might include a section on previous employments, while another might have sections on research or teaching experience. A single CV could also contain multiple such sections.

**XML as a Formalism for Semi-Structured Data**
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a widely accepted standard for describing documents and has become the universal data exchange model on the Web, particularly for business-to-business transactions. XML supports the development of semi-structured documents that contain both metadata and formatted text. Metadata, specified using XML tags, defines the structure of the document, enabling applications to understand and parse its content. Unlike HTML, XML provides explicit data structuring. XML uses DTD (Document Type Definition) or XSD (XML Schema Definition) as schema definitions for the semi-structured data in XML documents. Figure 3 illustrates the (semi) structure of an XML document containing students' records at a university.

### Structured Data

In contrast, structured data is highly rigid and describes objects using strongly typed attributes, which are organized as records or tuples. All records have the same fields, and data is organized into entities with similar entities grouped together using relations or classes. Entities in the same group have identical attributes, and the descriptions for all entities in a schema follow a predefined format, length, and order.

Structured data has been popular since the early days of computing, with many organizations relying on relational databases to maintain large structured repositories. Recent systems like CRM (Customer Relationship Management), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), and CMS (Content Management Systems) use structured data for their underlying data models.

### Levels of Semantics

Semantics is the study of the meaning of signs, such as terms or words. Depending on the approaches, models, or methods used to add semantics to terms, different degrees of semantics can be achieved. This section identifies and describes four representations that can be used to model and organize concepts to semantically describe terms: controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies. These four model representations are illustrated in Figure 4.

#### 4.1 Controlled Vocabularies

Controlled vocabularies are at the weaker end of the semantic spectrum. They are lists of terms (e.g., words, phrases, or notations) that have been explicitly enumerated. Each term in a controlled vocabulary should have an unambiguous, non-redundant definition. Controlled vocabularies are the simplest form of metadata and have been extensively used for classification. For example, Amazon.com uses a controlled vocabulary (Table 1) to help users search for products.

**Table 1: Controlled Vocabulary Used by Amazon.com**

- Electronics
- Cell Phones & Service
- Popular Music
- Camera & Photo
- Outlet

- Everything Else

- Toys
- Beauty
- Lifestyle
- Baby
- Gourmet Food
- Beta
- Pet Toys
- Computers
- Musical Instruments
- Arts & Hobbies
- Video Games
- Health/Personal Care
- Travel

Controlled vocabularies limit choices to an agreed-upon, unambiguous set of terms. In cataloging applications, users can select from a list of terms to describe an item, preventing ambiguity, meaningless entries, or misspellings.

#### 4.2 Taxonomies

A taxonomy is a subject-based classification that arranges terms in a controlled vocabulary into a hierarchy. Biologists were among the first to use taxonomies for classifying organisms, arranging plants and animals according to natural relationships. A taxonomy classifies terms in a hierarchical or tree-like structure, making explicit the relationships between words. Figure 5 shows a taxonomy of merchandise that can be bought for a home.

**Figure 5: Example of a Taxonomy**

- **Home**
  - **Kitchen**
    - Stove
    - Cupboard
    - Dining Table
    - Silverware
    - Tableware
  - **Living Room**
    - Coffee Table
    - Futon
    - Sofa
  - **Bathroom**
    - Lavatory
    - Toilet
    - Bathtub
  - **Furnishings**
    - Printer
    - Scanner
    - Modem
    - Network
    - Hardware
    - Computers
      - Software
        - Antivirus
        - OS
        - Editing
        - Spreadsheet
        - Drawing

The hierarchy in a taxonomy contains parent-child relationships, such as "is subclass of" or "is superclass of." Understanding the semantics of a word involves analyzing its relationship with other words in the hierarchy.

#### 4.3 Thesauri

A thesaurus is a networked collection of controlled vocabulary terms with conceptual relationships. It extends a taxonomy by allowing terms to be arranged hierarchically and by enabling additional statements and relationships. A thesaurus can be converted into a taxonomy or controlled vocabulary, though some expressiveness and semantics may be lost. Table 2 shows an example of a thesaurus listing for the term "academic achievement."

**Table 2: Example of a Thesaurus Listing for Academic Achievement**

- **Used for:**
  - Grade Point Average
  - Scholastic Achievement
  - School Achievement
- **Narrower than:**
  - Academic Overachievement
  - Academic Underachievement
  - College Academic Achievement
  - Mathematics Achievement
  - Reading Achievement
  - Science Achievement
- **Broader than:**
  - Achievement
- **Related to:**
  - Academic Achievement Motivation
  - Academic Achievement Prediction
  - Academic Aptitude
  - Academic Failure
  - Academic Self-Concept
  - Education
  - Educational Attainment Level
  - School Graduation
  - School Learning
  - School Transition

According to the National Information Standards Organization (NISO 2005), there are four types of relationships in a thesaurus:
- **Equivalence:** Term t1 has the same or nearly the same meaning as term t2.
- **Homographic:** Two terms, t1 and t2, are spelled the same but have different meanings.
- **Hierarchical:** Based on "is subclass of" and "is superclass of" relationships.
- **Associative:** Links terms that are closely related in meaning but not hierarchically.

#### 4.4 Ontologies

Ontologies are similar to taxonomies but use richer semantic relationships among terms and attributes, along with strict rules for specifying terms and relationships. Originating from artificial intelligence, ontologies have been associated with logical inferencing and are now being applied to the semantic Web.

An ontology is a shared conceptualization of the world, consisting of definitional aspects (high-level schemas) and assertional aspects (entities, attributes, interrelationships, domain vocabulary, and factual knowledge). Ontologies provide a common understanding of a particular domain, facilitating communication between people, organizations, and application systems. They enable cross-node horizontal relationships between entities, making it easier to model real-world information requirements.

Jasper and Uschold (1999) identify three major uses of ontologies:
1. To assist in communication between human beings.
2. To achieve interoperability among software systems.
3. To improve the design and quality of software systems.

An ontology is technically a model that resembles an ordinary object model in object-oriented programming, consisting of classes, inheritance, and properties. In many situations, ontologies are considered a form of knowledge representation.

### Semantic Web Architecture

The semantic Web is a set of technologies, tools, and standards that form the infrastructure to support a Web with meaning. The semantic Web architecture is composed of a series of standards organized into a structure that expresses their interrelationships. This architecture, often represented in a diagram proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, starts with the foundation of URIs and Unicode. On top of this, the syntactic interoperability layer (XML) underlies RDF and RDF Schema (RDFS). Web ontology languages are built on top of RDF(S). The final layers, logic, proof, and trust, are still under exploration. Some layers rely on digital signatures to ensure security.
