Semi-structured data is organized into entities. Similar entities are grouped together,
but entities in the same group may not have the same attributes. The order of attributes
is not necessarily important and not all attributes may be required. The size and type of
same attributes in a group may differ.
An example of semi-structured data is a Curriculum Vitae. One person may have a
section of previous employments, another person may have a section on research
experience, and another may have a section on teaching experience. We can also find a
CV that contains two or more of these sections.
A very good example of a semi-structured formalism is XML which is a de facto
standard for describing documents that is becoming the universal data exchange model
on the Web and is being used for business-to-business transactions. XML supports the
development of semi-structured documents that contain both metadata and formatted
text. Metadata is specified using XML tags and defines the structure of documents.
Without metadata, applications would not be able to understand and parse the content of

XML documents. Compared to HTML, XML provides explicit data structuring. XML
uses DTD or XSD as schema definitions for the semi-structured data present in XML
documents. Figure 3 shows the (semi) structure of an XML document containing
students’ records at a university.
3.3 Structured data
In contrast, structured data is very rigid and describes objects using strongly typed
attributes, which are organized as records or tuples. All records have the same fields.
Data is organized in entities and similar entities are grouped together using relations or
classes. Entities in the same group have the same attributes. The descriptions for all the
entities in a schema have the same defined format, predefined length, and follow the
same order.
Structured data has been very popular since the early days of computing and many
organizations rely on relational databases to maintain very large structured repositories.
Recent systems, such as CRM (Customer Relationship Management), ERP (Enterprise
Resource Planning), and CMS (Content Management Systems) use structured data for
their underlying data model.
4 Levels of semantics
As we have seen previously, semantics is the study of the meaning of signs, such as
terms or words. Depending on the approaches, models, or methods used to add
semantics to terms, different degrees of semantics can be achieved. In this section we
identify and describe four representations that can be used to model and organize
concepts to semantically describe terms, i.e. controlled vocabularies, taxonomies,
thesaurus, and ontologies. These four model representations are illustrated in Figure 4.

4.1 Controlled vocabularies
Controlled vocabularies are at the weaker end of the semantic spectrum. A controlled
vocabulary is a list of terms (e.g., words, phrases, or notations) that have been
enumerated explicitly. All terms in a controlled vocabulary should have an
unambiguous, non-redundant definition. A controlled vocabulary is the simplest of all
metadata methods and has been extensively used for classification. For example,
Amazon.com has the following (Table 1) controlled vocabulary which can be selected
by the user to search for products.

Table 1. Controlled vocabulary used by Amazon.com
Controlled vocabularies limit choices to an agreed upon unambiguous set of terms. In
cataloguing applications, users can be presented with list of terms from which they can
pick the term to describe an item for cataloguing. The main objective of a controlling
vocabulary is to prevent users from defining their own terms which can be ambiguous,
meaningless, or misspelled.
4.2 Taxonomies
A taxonomy is a subject-based classification that arranges the terms in a controlled
vocabulary into a hierarchy without doing anything further. The first users of
taxonomies were biologists in the classification of organisms. They have employed this
method to classify plants and animals according to a set of natural relationships. A
taxonomy classifies terms in the shape of a hierarchy or tree. It describes a word by
making explicit its relationship with other words. Figure 5 shows a taxonomy of
merchandise that can be bought for a home.

Figure 5: Example of a taxonomy
The hierarchy of a taxonomy contains parent-child relationships, such as “is subclass
of” or “is superclass of”. A user or computer can comprehend the semantics of a word
by analyzing the existing relationship between the word and the words around it in the
hierarchy.
4.3 Thesaurus
A thesaurus is a networked collection of controlled vocabulary terms with conceptual
relationships between terms. A thesaurus is an extension of a taxonomy by allowing
terms to be arranged in a hierarchy and also allowing other statements and relationships
to be made about the terms. A thesaurus can easily be converted into a taxonomy or
controlled vocabulary. Of course, in such conversion, expressiveness and semantics are
lost. Table 2 shows an example1 of a thesaurus listing for the term academic
achievement.

Table 2. Example of a thesaurus listing for the term academic achievement
According to the National Information Standards Organization (NISO 2005), there
are four different types of relationships that are used in a thesaurus: equivalence,
homographic, hierarchical, and associative.
• Equivalence. An equivalence relation says that a term t has the same or nearly
1
the same meaning as a term t .
2
• Homographic. Two terms, t and t , are called homographic if term t is spelled
1 2 1
the same way as a term t , but has a different meaning.
2
• Hierarchical. This relationship is based on the degrees or levels of “is subclass
of” and “is superclass of” relationships. The former represents a class or a
whole, and the latter refers to its members or parts.
• Associative. This relationship is used to link terms that are closely related in
meaning semantically but not hierarchically. An example of an associative
relationship can be as simple as “is related to” as in term t “is related to” term t .

4.4 Ontologies
Ontologies are similar to taxonomies but use richer semantic relationships among terms
and attributes, as well as strict rules about how to specify terms and relationships. In
computer science, ontologies have emerged from the area of artificial intelligence.
Ontologies have generally been associated with logical inferencing and recently have
begun to be applied to the semantic Web.
An ontology is a shared conceptualization of the world. Ontologies consist of
definitional aspects such as high-level schemas and assertional aspects such as entities,
attributes, interrelationships between entities, domain vocabulary and factual knowledge
– all connected in a semantic manner (Sheth 2003). Ontologies provide a common
understanding of a particular domain. They allow the domain to be communicated

between people, organizations, and application systems. Ontologies provide the specific
tools to organize and provide a useful description of heterogeneous content.
In addition to the hierarchical relationship structure of typical taxonomies, ontologies
enable cross-node horizontal relationships between entities, thus enabling easy
modeling of real-world information requirements. Jasper and Uschold (1999) identify
three major uses of ontologies:
1) to assist in communication between human beings
2) to achieve interoperability among software systems
3) to improve the design and the quality of software systems
An ontology is technically a model which looks very much like an ordinary object
model in object-oriented programming. It consists of classes, inheritance, and properties
(Fensel 2001). In many situations, ontologies are thought of as knowledge
representation.
5 Semantic Web Architecture
The semantic Web identifies a set of technologies, tools, and standards which form the
basic building blocks of an infrastructure to support the vision of the Web associated
with meaning. The semantic Web architecture is composed of a series of standards
organized into a certain structure that is an expression of their interrelationships. This
architecture is often represented using a diagram first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee
(Berners-Lee, Hendler et al. 2001). Figure 6 illustrates the different parts of the
semantic Web architecture. It starts with the foundation of URIs and Unicode. On top of
that we can find the syntactic interoperability layer in the form of XML, which in turn
underlies RDF and RDF Schema (RDFS). Web ontology languages are built on top of
RDF(S). The three last layers are the logic, proof, and trust, which have not been
significantly explored. Some of the layers rely on the digital signature component to
ensure security.
