**ATT&CK ID:** C0015  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Service Scanning

In the context of C0015, threat actors utilized the `net view /all` command to gather information about the local time of a compromised network.[19]

### Explanation:
- **ATT&CK ID and Technique Name:** The ATT&CK ID (C0015) and the corresponding technique name (Network Service Scanning) have been clearly stated.
- **Command Usage:** The command `net view /all` is used to list all shared resources on a network. However, it does not directly provide the local time. If the intent was to gather the local time, the command `net time` would be more appropriate. If the original command was indeed `net view /all`, it might be more accurate to say that the threat actors were gathering information about network shares, which could indirectly help in understanding the network's structure and activity.

If the goal was to gather the local time, the text should be revised as follows:
