User: I am writing some Python script and I would like to use os.chroot to execute some code under chroot environment.  The problem is after calling os.chroot, paths in sys.path lie outside of the chroot jail, so import won't work.  What's the best way to do it?
Assistant: You can do all necessary imports before os.chroot.
