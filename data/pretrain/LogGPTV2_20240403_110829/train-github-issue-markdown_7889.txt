### Issue Description

When attempting to use the search function on the documentation page, I consistently encounter a message stating "initializing search," and the search never actually completes. I have tried several troubleshooting steps, including:

- Clearing my browser cache and cookies
- Switching to a different network

Despite these efforts, the problem persists.
