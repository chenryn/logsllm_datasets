User: I am using a Python on a Mac and I know that Python 2 comes preinstalled on the system (and in fact usable through Terminal). Is there a way to make it so Terminal can run Python 3? Can/should you set this as a default? I know changing the default settings for Python version usage could break your system so should I just install Python 3 and then use it through its launch icon instead?
Assistant: Best option is to install Python through Anaconda. This allows easy management and much more. You can have virtual environments having different Python versions as well as different modules installed.
