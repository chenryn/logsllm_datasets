### Verifying the Checksum
To verify the integrity of the Nessus installer, we first create a file named `sha256sum_nessus` that contains the SHA256 checksum and the filename of the installer. The button next to the SHA256 checksum on the Tenable website only copies the checksum itself, so we need to manually add the filename. The resulting `sha256sum_nessus` file should be in the same directory as the Nessus installer.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ cd ~/Downloads
kali@kali:~/Downloads$ echo "4987776fef98bb2a72515abc0529e90572778b1d7aeeb1939179ff1f4de1440d Nessus-10.5.0-debian10_amd64.deb" > sha256sum_nessus
kali@kali:~/Downloads$ sha256sum -c sha256sum_nessus
Nessus-10.5.0-debian10_amd64.deb: OK
```

The output confirms that the checksums match, indicating that the package is intact and can be installed.

### Installing Nessus
To install the Nessus package, we use the `apt` command with the `install` option:

```bash
kali@kali:~/Downloads$ sudo apt install ./Nessus-10.5.0-debian10_amd64.deb
...
Preparing to unpack .../Nessus-10.5.0-debian10_amd64.deb ...
Unpacking nessus (10.5.0) ...
Setting up nessus (10.5.0) ...
...
Unpacking Nessus Scanner Core Components...
- You can start Nessus Scanner by typing /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service
- Then go to https://kali:8834/ to configure your scanner
```

After the installation is complete, we can start the `nessusd` service via `systemctl`:

```bash
kali@kali:~/Downloads$ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
```

### Configuring Nessus
Once Nessus is running, we can launch a browser and navigate to <https://127.0.0.1:8834>. We will be presented with a warning indicating an unknown certificate issuer, which is expected due to the use of a self-signed certificate. To accept and trust the self-signed certificate, we can click on "Advanced…" and then "Accept the Risk and Continue."

#### Pre-Installation Settings
After the page loads, we are prompted to configure pre-installation settings. Click on "Continue" to proceed with the default settings.

#### Selecting Nessus Product
Next, we select a Nessus product. For this Learning Unit, we choose "Register for Nessus Essentials" and click "Continue."

#### Requesting an Activation Code
We are then prompted to request an activation code for Nessus Essentials. Provide the required information and click "Register." Once registered, the activation code will be displayed in the next window.

#### Creating a Local Nessus User Account
Next, we create a local Nessus user account. Choose the username `admin` and a strong password to protect our vulnerability scan results. These credentials will be used to log in to the Nessus application.

#### Downloading Nessus Plugins
Finally, Nessus downloads and compiles all plugins. This process can take a significant amount of time to complete.

### Exploring Nessus Components
Before starting our first vulnerability scan, let's familiarize ourselves with the core components of Nessus. When we log in for the first time, we find a welcome window that allows us to enter targets. We can close it without entering anything for now.

#### Nessus Dashboard Tabs
In the Essentials version of Nessus, we have two tabs: "Scans" and "Settings."

- **Settings Tab**: Allows us to configure the application. For example, we can enter information for an SMTP server to receive scan results via email. The advanced menu allows us to configure global settings related to the user interface, scan and log behavior, security, and performance.
- **About Menu**: Lists basic information about Nessus, our license, and the number of hosts remaining. For more information on customizing and configuring Nessus, consult the Nessus documentation.

#### Policies and Templates
- **Policies**: A set of predefined configuration options for a Nessus scan. When saved, a policy can be used as a template for new scans.
- **Scan Templates**: Nessus provides a variety of scanning templates grouped into three categories: Discovery, Vulnerabilities, and Compliance.

### Performing a Vulnerability Scan
To perform our first vulnerability scan, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "New Scan" button on the dashboard in the "Scans" tab.
2. Select the "Basic Network Scan" template.
3. Configure the scan settings:
   - **General Settings**: Enter a name for the scan and a list of targets. For this example, we will scan the machines POULTRY, JENKINS, WK01, and SAMBA.
   - **Discovery Settings**: Customize the port scan range to "80,443" and enable the option "Consider unscanned ports as closed."
   - **Host Discovery**: Turn off host discovery to save time and scan the targets more quietly.

### Launching the Scan
Save the scan configuration and launch the scan. The scan status will initially show as "Running" in the Nessus dashboard under "My Scans." Once the scan is completed, the status will change to "Completed."

### Analyzing the Results
In this section, we will analyze the results of our first vulnerability scan. Due to continuous updates of Nessus and its plugins, the scan results may vary slightly. Click on the scan in the "My Scans" list to view the results dashboard.
