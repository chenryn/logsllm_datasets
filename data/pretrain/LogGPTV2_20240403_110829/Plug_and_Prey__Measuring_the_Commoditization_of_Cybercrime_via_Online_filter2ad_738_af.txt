In conclusion, we ﬁnd that, at least on online anony-
mous marketplaces, commoditization is a spottier phe-
nomenon than was previously assumed. Within the
niches where it ﬂourishes, we do observe growth. That
being said, there is no supply for many of the capa-
bilities, systems and resources observed in well-known
value chains. There is also no evidence of a rapid growth,
and thus of a strong push towards commoditization, con-
trary to the somewhat alarmist language found in indus-
try reporting and elsewhere.
In terms of generalizability of our ﬁndings, we have
measured and explained the trends in commoditization of
cybercrime on online anonymous markets. Beyond this,
our ﬁndings only speculatively suggest that the trend to-
ward commoditization might not be as comprehensive as
has been claimed elsewhere. Perhaps less commoditized
forms of B2B transactions - e.g., collaboration emerging
out of forums - are important in the areas absent from the
anonymous markets. Also, vertical integration probably
remains important for more complex and dynamic forms
of cybercrime.
Still, this casts an interesting perspective on the “the-
ory of the commoditization of cybercrime.”
There
is a huge discrepancy between the reported proﬁtabil-
ity of criminal business models like ransomware (over
$1 billion in 2016, according to the FBI [20]) or
DDoS-services (one youngster making $385,000 with
his booter-service according to local British police [2])
and the marginal markets for cybercrime commodi-
ties. The commodities for a ransomware operation seem
available in these markets: malware, PPI, cash-out. The
huge proﬁts would surely draw in new entrepreneurs to
assemble this value chain based on components they can
just buy on the anonymous markets. But if that would
be the case, should that not cause a more observable rise
in the commodities trade on these markets? The lack of
strong growth suggests that there are still bottlenecks in
outsourcing critical parts of criminal value chains. En-
try barriers for would-be criminal entrepreneurs remain.
The services that are highly commoditized, like booters,
seem to draw in mostly B2C activities – i.e., consumers
going after other consumers, as was the dominant ﬁnding
in a victimization study of commoditized DDoS [37]. A
recent takedown of a RAT operation also suggested con-
sumer consumption, rather than B2B transactions [6].
This should not be read to downplay the relevance or
danger of commoditization. A better understanding of
where commoditization succeeds and fails helps to iden-
tify which capabilities, services and resources are still
hard to come by, which supports designing better disrup-
tion strategies for criminal business models. The absence
or scarcity of certain commoditized cybercrime compo-
nents suggests these are either harder to produce or that
they cannot function on their own after a single-shot
sale. B2B services that require ongoing coordination
among the criminals fall short of full-ﬂedged commodi-
tization. In other words, the scarcity of supply suggests
less-scalable and potentially vulnerable components in
criminal value chains. These might be targeted by inter-
ventions. Earlier work on interventions that target choke
points shows that they can have measurable impact, not
via a wholesale shutdown of the business model, but
by raising transaction costs [12, 29]. For instance, we
found virtually no offerings for customer support ser-
vices. For a ransomware scheme, the customer service
component to guide inexperienced victims through the
steps to complete the ransomware payment might be the
most vulnerable. Contrast this approach to the series of
police actions aimed at the shutdown of whole markets:
from our data, these operations seemed to have had only
relatively modest effects on the overall trading of com-
moditized cybercrime. Understanding where commodi-
tization is lagging behind points to alternative disruption
strategies.
