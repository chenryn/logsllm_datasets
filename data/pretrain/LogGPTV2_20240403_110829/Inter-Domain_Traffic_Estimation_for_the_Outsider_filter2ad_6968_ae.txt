ments using a small number of sources and relying on an end-
to-end strategy, is that edges are selected disproportionately,
so bias arises when edges incident to a node in the underlying
graph are sampled disproportionately. Thus, an edge is
much more likely to be visible if it is close to the vantage
point that discovered them. To explore this potential issue,
we focus our analysis on the CAIDA 2011 dataset and look
at the discovered AS-links as the intersection of the number
of probes that crossed through them vs the corresponding
number of ALTPs that contain it. We concentrate on the
top AS-link with the largest number of ALTPs which is
seen by almost 10K ALTPs and was discovered by almost
half a million probes. Closer inspection shows that the
link connects AS195 (San Diego Supercomputer Center) and

AS2152 (the California State University Network) at SD-
NAP (an IXP located in San Diego, CA), and that all the
probes responsible for discovering this link correspond to a
CAIDA Ark monitor placed in the San Diego Supercomputer
Center. A similar scenario was observed for the other
top three links. This highlights that the location of the
vantage points can lead to erroneous inferences about a link’s
popularity.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We advance the state-of-the-art in traﬃc characterization
by presenting a novel technique to infer traﬃc volumes from
AS-level routing graphs carved out by massive traceroute
campaigns. Our Network Syntax approach builds on the
observation that the popularity of a route on the Internet
can serve as an informative proxy for the volume of traﬃc
it carries. Drawing analogies with city grids and traﬃc,
Network Syntax applies structural analysis and metrics to
predict with high accuracy the inter-domain traﬃc volume
carried by diﬀerent links. We demonstrated the eﬀectiveness
of our approach using two months of data (collected two
years apart) from a Tier-1 Internet Service Provider and a
large Internet eXchange Point, by identifying traﬃc-critical
links and inferring missing traﬃc matrix measurements.
We evaluated four diﬀerent publicly available traceroute
datasets, but selected two for inclusion (due to space
constraints) representing diﬀerent standpoints with respect
to type and location of vantage points. Multiple other
datasets collected over the years could be leveraged by
our technique, such as RIPE’s Atlas project [4], or those
collected from the DIMES project [43].
Going forward, Network Syntax opens a rich research
agenda from speciﬁc methodological aspects (e.g., diﬀerent
metrics and datasets attributes) to applications of a better-
understood ﬂow of Internet traﬃc. Could we identify high-
traﬃc links in the context of arbitrary AS-links on the
Internet, i.e. can we establish the relative importance of
a pair AS-links not tied to a speciﬁc network? This could
be used,
for instance, to augment existing AS-topology
maps with the relative importance of links based on traﬃc
carried. Could Network Syntax, perhaps in combination
with existing techniques, be used to complete partial-traﬃc
matrixes? Given our new ability to leverage long-available
traceroute datasets, what could this approach tell us about
the variability and evolution of the Internet over time?
