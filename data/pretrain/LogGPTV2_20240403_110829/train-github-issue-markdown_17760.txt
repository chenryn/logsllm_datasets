I understand that you are new to Doctrine and are encountering an issue with generating entities. Let me help you refine your description and provide a more professional and clear version of your text:

I am new to Doctrine and have created a YAML file named `XYZ.Model.User.dcm.yml` inside my `config` directory. I then ran the `orm:generate-entities` command to generate the corresponding entity in the `XYZ\Model\` directory. However, instead of generating the file at `XYZ\Model\User.php`, it generated the file at `XYZ\Model\XYZ\Model\User.php`.

Could you please help me understand what might be causing this issue and how I can resolve it?
