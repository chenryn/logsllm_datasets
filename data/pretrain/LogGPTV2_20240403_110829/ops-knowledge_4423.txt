User: My Mac came with Python 2.7 installed by default, but I'd like to use Python 3.6.1 instead.
How can I change the Python version used in Terminal (on Mac OS)?
Please explain clearly and offer no third party version manager suggestions.

Now add the line alias python=python3

Now check python version by using the command : python --version
