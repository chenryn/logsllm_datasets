operated, provides a prepaid shipping label to the drop (see Figure 2(b))
on which the sender ﬁeld has a phony name and a bogus, but existing,
address in the same city the drop resides in (). In our data, the desti-
nation address is with overwhelming majority in Moscow, Russia (see
Section 5.4.3). Furthermore, we observe that the value disclosed on
the customs form is merely a fraction of the actual value of the goods
(circled red in Figure 2(b)). This allows stuffers to evade customs duty
and import taxes. The drop then uses this prepaid label to ship the
repackaged goods to the stuffer ().
Finally, the stuffer pays the scam operators, receives the packages,
and resells the goods to realize their proﬁt. For instance, in one case
(see Figure 2), the stuffer bought a PlayStation 4 (with a stolen credit
card) valued at 399 US dollars, which he can resell easily for 300 US
dollars or more, resulting in a net proﬁt for him of at least 100 US
dollars (depending on the cost of the prepaid label and the cost of using
the reshipping site; see Section 5.1).
The drop remains active for about 30 days from the day of the ﬁrst
received package (see Section 5.3). Just as the drop should receive
his ﬁrst paycheck, the operator of the reshipping scam site suddenly
ceases all communication with the drop and never makes the promised
payment. Since the only communication channel between drop and
operator was a messaging system that is tightly integrated into the
reshipping website, all communication is cut by simply removing the
drop’s account. Eventually the drop realizes that he was scammed. In
the worst case, the drop himself will be the victim of identity theft (since
he uploaded identiﬁcation documents during the application process)
and perhaps even the subject of an investigation by local or federal law
enforcement, because of his involvement in credit card fraud.

We have collaborated closely with the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) and the United States Postal Investigation Service (USPIS)

SHIPPING-C, records 5,996 packages delivered within 9 months,
i.e., over 20 packages per day have been shipped through it. Table 2
shows the breakdown of the recorded packages compared to other
core elements of the reshipping logs, e.g., how many cardholders
have been exploited, how many drops have been abused, and how
many stuffers have proﬁted in this speciﬁc operation. In the case of
SHIPPING-C, each stuffer received 55.5 packages on average (i.e.,
used the reshipping service 55.5 times), 4,208 different cardholders
were exploited, and each drop received nearly seven packages on
average.
3) Prepaid Labels. Prepaid labels are the shipping labels that scam-
mers purchase, and that are provided to the drops to ship the
packages to the stuffer. All prepaid labels are PDF ﬁles, and most
name the stuffer as the recipient, and provide a bogus sender ad-
dress and information about the package’s contents. While some
information on the label is bogus (e.g., the sender address and the
contents’ value), the detailed description of the contents is com-
monly somewhat accurate. For instance, a package might contain
a video game console, but instead of being used, it is actually brand
new and signiﬁcantly more valuable (see Figure 2(b)). We use
optical character recognition (OCR) to automatically extract such
information from the labels (PDF ﬁles) (see Section 5).
4) Drop Details. The drop details contain personally-identiﬁable
information of drops, such as their home addresses, scans of their
passports, drivers’ licenses, prior employment records, and some-
times even their social security numbers. The scammers require
the drops to submit this information to apply for the job in the ﬁrst
place. Providing this information to the scam operators bears an
additional and signiﬁcant risk for the drops: the operators can and
are disclosing the information to stuffers if, for example, a drop
is unreliable and does not reship some goods to the stuffers (see
Section 5.1.1). This might be because the drop decided to keep the
item or if the drop is caught by law enforcement before being able
to ship the item. Disclosing this information to the stuffers is part of
the agreement that the stuffer and the operator enter, and it provides
the stuffer with a basic level of security because it allows them to
identify the mules or abuse their information for other frauds, such
as opening credit cards or bank accounts in their names.
5) Messages. The reshipping operations we studied feature an inte-
grated messaging system. This messaging system is used by the
scam operators to provide support to the stuffers and to the drops
alike. For instance, in some cases providing the prepaid label to
the drop (for the shipment to the stuffer) is part of the operator’s
overall service. In this case, the stuffer would request labels for
shipments through the messaging system. In other cases, it is used
to arrange payment by the stuffer to the operator. Similarly, a drop
would report problems when trying to drop off a package at the
postal ofﬁce through the messaging system to the operator. Note
that the integrated messaging system is the only communication
channel that mules can use to contact the operator. Stuffers, how-
ever, are often provided with the information necessary to contact
the operator through ICQ or Jabber for additional, time-sensitive
support.
6) Rules. Finally, for some reshipping scam websites we have detailed
information about operational policies and news updates that were
posted on the websites. Additionally, this information contains the
agreement that the stuffers enter into when using the service.
Note that the messages and rules provide anecdotal evidence that cor-
roborates our hypotheses about the inner workings of reshipping scams.
To provide an in-depth analysis of the operational logistics of re-
shipping scams, we combine and link the separate datasets within
a reshipping service. This allows us to gain novel insights on how
the scam works in detail, and how the different parties interact with
(a) Invoice of a Sony PlayStation 4 video game console that a stuffer
purchased at Walmart and shipped through a drop.
(b) Prepaid reshipping label that the stuffer provided to the drop to
ship the video game console to Moscow, Russia. Note that the customs
declaration form states that it is a used game console and valued at 90
US dollars, while the original invoice states 399 US dollars.

over the course of this research effort. During this time we obtained a
comprehensive and detailed dataset on seven reshipping scam websites
and their operations, spanning from 2010 to 2015. We summarize the
high-level statistics of our dataset in Table 1. While some reshipping
scam websites have been taken down (SHIPPING-E, SHIPPING-F,
and SHIPPING-G), others remain active at the time of submission
and are of investigative interest to federal law enforcement. To avoid
interference with any potential investigations, we use non-identiﬁable
names to distinguish them instead of disclosing their actual names.
Furthermore, disclosing the websites’ names does not provide any
additional insight into the scammers’ operations. In the remainder of
this paper, we therefore use the non-identiﬁable names exclusively. For
each reshipping scam that we investigate, we have some or all of the
following information, which we analyze in more detail in Section 5:
1) Time Period. The period indicates the time frame for each scam
operation in our dataset. The longest running reshipping scam
that we observed is SHIPPING-E, which was active for at least 12
months.
2) Reshipping Logs. The reshipping logs contain detailed informa-
tion from the reshipping scam sites’ databases, including: times-
tamps, corresponding stuffers, exploited cardholders, assigned
drops, tracking numbers for the shipments by the merchants to the
drops, and tracking numbers for the reshipped packages destined

Table 1: Summary of the site-speciﬁc data sets. Reshipping logs include detailed information about the package contents, their values, the
corresponding stuffers, the receiving drops, tracking numbers, and timestamps. Prepaid labels contain information about the stuffers’ locations,
the cost of the labels, and the values of the items. Drop details include sensitive and personally-identiﬁable information, such as passports, drivers’
licenses, or addresses. Messages contain interactions between stuffers and the website operators and messages between drops and the website
operators. Rules contain information for stuffers on price changes for shipments, how and through what channels prepaid labels must be bought,
information on refunds for lost shipments, or announcements that drops are unreliable.

each other. For instance, if a reshipping log entry of SHIPPING-A
indicates that stuffer X purchased goods with the stolen credit card of
cardholder Y and assigned the reshipping task to drop Z, then we know
that the credit card of victim Y was stolen and fraudulently charged,
and that the merchant shipped a package to Z, whose address will
appear in the drop details. From the associated prepaid label, we can
then further identify the address and possibly the name of the stuffer.
Continuing down this path, we can investigate the messages exchanged
between Z and the scam operator, which might reveal that Z received
speciﬁc reshipping instructions, e.g., to bundle two packages into one.
Similarly, the interactions between the stuffer X and the scam operator
can provide insightful information about the illegal business practices
and the relationship between stuffers and operators. Due to the breadth
and variety of the information available to us, we are able to provide
highly-detailed insights into the operation of reshipping scams.
In addition to the site-speciﬁc data that we have analyzed, USPIS
and the FBI have shared additional high-level information with us,
including information on drops’ addresses, label purchase services,
and data on the scale of suspicious packages being shipped by drops.
The provided information allowed us to expand our observations to
a larger scale and to estimate the ﬁnancial loss of victims (merchants,
cardholders, and drops) of reshipping scams.
4 Ethics
The data that we analyze in this paper provokes various questions in
respect to the ethical handling of it. First and foremost, the work that we
present in this paper was conducted in full compliance with the approval
of our institutional review board (IRB), as well as in close collaboration
with federal law enforcement (FBI and USPIS). Furthermore, contrary
to prior work, we are not trading or interacting with the operators of the
scam, stuffers, or any middlemen. We are neither renting drops from the
operator nor are we buying goods from the stuffers that they purchased
with stolen credit cards. Over the course of this paper, we have not
interacted with the victims or the scammers. Instead, we analyze
information from their databases and operational logs exclusively.
However, because our data contains some personally-identiﬁable
information (see Section 3), we must handle it properly and with
extreme care. All our data is encrypted at rest (on the disk) as well as
in motion (when transferred). Moreover, we use ﬁctitious one-way
pseudonyms to retain accountability but prevent disclosure of any
personal information. Similarly, we abstracted addresses at a city
level, which anonymizes the exact location and auxiliary information
such as neighborhoods (e.g., high-income or low-income). Lastly, our
work primarily presents aggregate statistics and results on the entire
reshipping scam, and we are not reporting information on the victims
(cardholders and drops) themselves.
Finally, the goal of this research is twofold. Primarily, we aim to
provide a detailed exploration of the inner workings of reshipping
scams to the research community. At the same time, this research is
intended to provide law enforcement and policy makers with the most
effective steps to disrupt this criminal activity and prevent more victims
from being hurt by reshipping scams. We are certain that the beneﬁts to
the general public of our study strongly exceed any knowledge that the
criminals might obtain from the high-level details that we present in
our paper. We have worked closely with the FBI and USPIS in respect
to not disclosing any information indicative of individual sites that
might alert the operators.
5 Measurement and Analysis
In this section, we provide a detailed analysis of reshipping scams,
calculate statistics on different aspects of them, and provide insights
into the following issues: how do miscreants split the illicit proﬁt,
who are the victims, how much is the ﬁnancial loss, and what is the
life cycle of a drop. Furthermore, we identify potential bottlenecks
in reshipping scam operations and propose intervention approaches.
5.1 Illicit Business Model
Miscreants use reshipping scams to gain an illicit proﬁt, particularly
to monetize stolen credit cards. The core component of the scam is
the reshipping site, which provides “reshipping as a service” to other
criminals (stuffers). A range of players participate in the scam, provide
various services, and share the illicit income.
5.1.1 Agreement and Proﬁt Split between Criminals
In exchange for renting drops out to stuffers, reshipping scam site
operators charge a commission. The rule pages that we extracted
