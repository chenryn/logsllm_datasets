will  establish  a  security  token  with  the  communicating  parties. 
This  security  token  may  have  a  time-to-live  or  valid-period 
attribute  to  indicate  security  token  validity  by  defining  the  time 
frame or the use count. For all  sessions in the valid time period, 
the communicating peers exchange data  using the security token 
for authentication purpose. Before the expiration of time-to-live or 
valid-period  attribute,  the  gateway  is  free  from  succeeding 
authentication  workload.  Based  on  the  concept  of  this  category, 
the research [17] constructs a delegation-based authentication and 
authorization  scheme  for  DTLS.  The  pros  and  cons  of  the 
authentication methods in this category are described as follows. 
  Pros 
o  The load for succeeding authentication after initialization  is 
removed from the gateway. 
o  It  is  suitable  for  resource-constrained  peers  where  token-
based  authentication  is  considered  to  be  lightweight  in 
computation. 
  Cons 
o  Single  point  failure,  such  as  compromised  gateway,  may 
expose  peers  to  threats  since  the  initial  authentication 
session is performed by the gateway. 
o  The  design  of  a  scheme  using  security  tokens  can  be 
difficult  because  both  security  requirements  and  resource 
restriction  of  the  peers  must  be  taken  into  consideration 
simultaneously. 
The authentication-by-security-token model relies on the domestic 
gateway to distribute a security token to the communicating peers. 
Upon receipt of the security token, the communicating peers use it 
to  authenticate  each  other.  This  shifted  the  authentication 
workload to the communicating peers to alleviate the workload on 
the gateways. The valid period of a security token can be rather 
short if the communicating peers are resource-constrained objects 
which  cannot  afford  strong  security  protection.  Thus,  this 
authentication  model  is  still  resource-constrained  friendly.  As  a 
comparison  to  the  previous  authentication  model,  this  model  is 
also applicable to centralized communication over public network. 
The overhead for a gateway is to set up and manage the security 
tokens. 
4.3  Authentication by Trust Chain 
In  this  model,  the  trust  relationship  "peer  A  trusts  peer  B"  is 
defined as follows.  Peer A is convinced that the incoming data D 
is indeed from peer C, if peer B certifies that data D is from peer 
C.  Therefore,  a  trust  graph  is  constructed  as  a  connected  and 
directed graph in which the successor of a directed edge trusts the 
predecessor. The gateway is the predecessor of all the peers that 
are  assigned  to  the  domestic  registration  domain,  and  a  public 
authority  certifies  the  gateway.  If  two  communication  peers 
belonging to different trust graphs need to authenticate each other, 
one or multiple edges should be added to concatenate the two trust 
graphs in  a  proper  manner.  In this  configuration,  both  peers  can 
find particular predecessor which is trusted by itself and certifies 
the  other  peer.  There  are  existent  standards  using  a  trust  graph 
structure, such as X.509 PKI (IETF RFC 5280) and DNSSEC [18]. 
As  an  example,  an  authentication  method  based  on  X.509  PKI 
uses digital certificates for authentication. In the setup phase, the 
gateway  must  act  as  the  concatenating  point  which  requests  a 
digital  certificate  from  a  public  CA  (Certificate  Authority)  and 
issues  its  own  private,  proprietary  certificates  to  the  domestic 
objects. For simplicity, the proprietary certificate does not need to 
follow  the  X.509  standard  format;  however,  the  communication 
peers  must  all  agree  on  using  the  proprietary  authentication 
method.  After the setup phase, domestic peers can achieve mutual 
authentication with all the peers that trust the same proprietary CA. 
The pros and cons of the authentication-by-trust-chain model are 
listed below: 
  Pros 
o  After the setup phase, there will be no further authentication 
workload  on  the  gateway.  Thus,  this  authentication  model 
reduces the workload for authentication. 
o  This  model 
is  based  on 
In  practice, 
authentication  standards  of  this  model  are  designed  to 
provide better security functionalities compared to the basic 
authentication methods. 
trust  chain. 
o  Instead of applying for a certificate for each domestic object, 
proprietary  certificate  authority  is  employed  to  reduce  the 
cost of obtaining public certificates. 
  Cons 
o  This  kind  of  authentication  scheme  is  more  complex,  and 
may not be suitable for resource-constrained objects. A fair 
amount of computation power is required. 
o  The  authentication  model  uses  similar  methods  for  both 
domestic peers and foreign peers, which make it inflexible. 
o  Single  point  of  failure,  such  as  a  compromised  gateway, 
may break the trust chain. 
A  prerequisite  for  this  model is that  a  home/organization  owner 
must  have  a  certificate  authority  for  all  the  objects,  and  this 
certificate authority  must  also  obtained  a  digital  certificate  from 
an upper-tier to chain up the trust (i.e. trust graph concatenation). 
For traveling objects to phone home, no trust graph concatenation 
is  required  given  that  the  digital  certificate  is  issued  by  the 
domestic gateway. However, trust graph concatenation is required 
if  an  object  is  owned  by  an  outsider.  This  will  require 
communicating  parties  to  acquire  all  the  intermediate  digital 
certificates  to  construct  the  chain  of  trust  (i.e.  trust  graph 
concatenation). This authentication model shifts the authentication 
workload  to  the  communicating  objects.  Therefore,  it  may  not 
particularly suitable for certain resource-constrained objects.  
4.4  Authentication by Global Trust Tree 
Unlike the authentication-by-trust-chain model, a global trust tree 
is used instead. All the peers are registered in the global trust tree. 
As a result, all the peers can be authenticated globally. To our best 
knowledge, currently no global trust trees are available. DNSSEC 
can be a potential candidate to construct one [19]. However, some 
practical issues [20][21] will need to be resolved  before moving 
forward.  The  pros  and  cons  of  this  authentication  model  are  as 
follows: 
  Pros 
o  Global trust graph is more reliable (in terms of management) 
comparing to the trust architecture using a private gateway. 
o  The  gateway  does  not  intervene  in  authentication  process, 
and thus can concentrate on network traffic forwarding tasks. 
o  The  underlying  scheme  is  in  general  an  international 
standard,  which  is  more  robust  in  achieving  mutual 
authentication. 
  Cons 
5o  Global  trust  graph  is  not  available  in  the  current  Internet 
framework. 
o  Constructing  a  global  trust  graph  that  includes  all  the 
objects in IoT is expensive and may be infeasible. 
o  Even if a global trust graph is available, the registration fee 
will be high as a whole for all the domestic objects. 
In  comparison  with  authentication-by-trust-chain,  authentication-
by-global-trust-tree  can  enforce  strict  rules  to  manage  digital 
certificates.  In  this  authentication  model,  the  gateways  of  the 
communicating peers do not take part in authentication. Routing 
network traffic is their primary task. However, the communicating 
objects must be capable of performing data authentication, which 
may  be  problematic  for  some  resource-constrained  objects. 
Therefore, it is  more  appropriate  in  this  authentication  model  to 
centralize  data  retrieval  over  the  public  network  or  cloud 
computing  communication environment  to reduce the  amount  of 
data exchanged. 
5.  CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper,  emerging  security  threats  and  countermeasures  in 
IoT  are  investigated.    In  particular,  challenges  to  sensitive  and 
private  information  exchanged  between  travelling  objects  and 
objects  at  home/organization  are  evaluated.  Naming,  identity 
management, and authentication of IoT objects are the key issues 
for  secure  communication  and  data  retrieval.  Based  on  various 
communication  scenarios in  IoT,  we  enumerated  a  few  potential 
authentication schemes that are applicable.  Hopefully this attempt 
can motivate more future work to cope with security concerns in 
the deployment of IoT.
