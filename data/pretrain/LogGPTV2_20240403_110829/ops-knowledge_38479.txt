Question: In the context of web security, the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) has certain exceptions. Analyze the security implications of these exceptions and select the statements that are true.
"A": "The SCRIPT tag exception allows JavaScript to be fetched from any origin, which can lead to running untrusted code with the privileges of the fetching origin.",
"B": "IFRAMEs are completely isolated from the parent page, preventing any form of interaction and thus pose no security risk.",
"C": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is considered safe because it allows servers to explicitly control cross-origin requests, defaulting to denial if not understood.",
"D": "Using the IFRAME tag without restrictions enhances security because it allows embedding content from trusted sources."
Answer: AC
