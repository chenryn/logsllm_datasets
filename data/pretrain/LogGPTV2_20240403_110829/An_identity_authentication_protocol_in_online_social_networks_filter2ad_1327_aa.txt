## Abstract
This paper introduces a secure and efficient hierarchical identity-based access authentication protocol for mobile networks. The proposed protocol leverages port-based vector switching to enhance the registration process, significantly reducing registration delays, especially in multi-hop and bandwidth-constrained scenarios. By integrating this enhanced mobile scheme with hierarchical identity-based signatures (HIBS), the protocol achieves local verification, concurrency, and hierarchical structure. The authentication process is divided into two phases to precompute time-consuming parameters, thereby minimizing the impact on signing and verifying operations. Additionally, a new algorithm for selecting optimal access routers is introduced. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol outperforms existing schemes, such as those based on identity-based signatures and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), by reducing total latency by approximately 50% and 83%, respectively.

## 1. Introduction
Handover and authentication are critical aspects of mobile networks, directly influencing mobility efficiency. Current handover proposals often focus on signal interactions but neglect the time-consuming registration process, making it challenging to integrate with authentication. Similarly, many authentication policies overlook the actual algorithms and registration. This paper aims to combine handover and authentication in a secure and efficient manner.

Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) and its enhancements have been proposed to improve mobile performance, but they primarily adjust the message sequences and add extra constraints, without addressing the home registration delay. Vector Network (VN) technology, which operates at Layer 3, offers a solution by providing fast data transmission through vector switching (VS). We use VN's techniques to enhance handover, transforming MIPv6 into a modified version called Mobile Vector Network Protocol (MVNP).

Access authentication ensures the validity of a user's identity to grant network access. Many current authentication protocols are based on public key infrastructure (PKI), leading to complex certificate management and inefficient mutual authentication. Identity-based cryptography, particularly hierarchical identity-based signatures (HIBS), simplifies key management and supports large-scale hierarchical networks. However, existing HIBS-based mobile protocols have limitations, such as being designed for flat network architectures and requiring additional interactions.

In this paper, we propose a cross-layered MVNP to achieve fast registration without additional signals. Based on this, we introduce a hierarchical authentication protocol (HA-HIBS-VN) that integrates HIBS and VN. HA-HIBS-VN enables local network authentication, precomputes signing and verifying values, and concurrently executes registration and authentication to optimize handover latency. A new access router selection algorithm is also proposed to enhance handover and authentication performance. Theoretical analysis and simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

## 2. Overview of Vector Networks
Vector networks (VNs) are hierarchical network technologies operating at the network layer. They offer unique advantages, including vector addresses (VAs), mobility, identifier-locator separation, and control-data plane separation. Key terminologies include:

- **Identifier (ID)**: A unique, hierarchical identity for network nodes.
- **Locator**: The current location of a network node.
- **Peer Group (PG)**: Network entities organized into groups based on social affiliations or policies. Each PG has a leader (PGL) responsible for management tasks.
- **Peer Group Tree (PGT)**: A hierarchical structure formed by PGLs, including locator PGT (Loc-PGT) and identifier PGT (ID-PGT).
- **Vector Address (VA)**: A forwarding address in VN, consisting of a series of output port numbers along the data path.

Figure 1 illustrates a simple VN model, showing how VAs and VS work. Table I outlines the process of vector switching.

| B1    | {010,10,11}   | 2         |
| B3    | {10,11}       | 2         |
| B2    | {11}          | 3         |

The detailed process and further analysis will be provided in subsequent sections.

Theoretical analysis and simulation results will be presented to evaluate the security and performance of the proposed protocol.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper presents a novel, secure, and efficient hierarchical identity-based access authentication protocol for mobile networks. The protocol integrates vector switching and HIBS to reduce handover and authentication latency, offering significant improvements over existing schemes. Future work will explore further enhancements and applications.
