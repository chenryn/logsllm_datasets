ABSTRACT
This paper presents a secure and efﬁcient hierarchical identity-based access authentication protocol for mobile network.
First, a new mobile scheme is constructed to improve the registration performance by the port-based vector switching;
especially when there are multihops and bandwidth between the user and home network, the registration delay is greatly
reduced. Second, an access authentication protocol is proposed by combining the designed mobile proposal with hierarchical
identity-based signature. It has the characteristics of identity based, local veriﬁcation, concurrency and hierarchy. The whole
authenticating process is divided into two phrases to precompute some time-consuming parameters, which are important to
decrease the effects of the signing/verifying. Besides, a new access router selection algorithm is given for the mobile user
to choose optimal access point in this paper. The theoretical analysis and simulating results show that the proposed
authentication protocol outperforms the previous ones in terms of the handover delay integrating the authentication with
its security enhanced. For example, the falling speed of the new protocol’s total latency is reduced about 50% and 83%,
respectively, compared with the existing identity-based-signature-based and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman-based schemes.

1. INTRODUCTION
The handover and authentication are both important issues
for mobile network. They have direct inﬂuences on mobility
efﬁciency and interact with each other. However, most of the
current handover proposals only focus on the signal running
orders of edge hosts but ignore the time-wasting registration,
which makes authentication hard to cooperate with hand-
over. Similarly, many authentication policies simply devise
hosts’ operations without thinking of the actual authenticat-
ing algorithms and registration. This paper aims to combine
handover and authentication in a secure and efﬁcient manner.
Handover comprises a series of the signal interactions
caused by the user’s routing preﬁx changing. MIPv6 [1]
and its enhancements [2–4] have been proposed to improve
the mobile performance. But they just change the executing
sequences of edge nodes’ messages and add extra limits
and costs. The home registration that may be the most
time-consuming is not concerned either. Although many
technologies (e.g., [5,6]) are presented to improve routers’
forwarding for registration, they no more than patch some

IP net’s drawbacks and must be placed in mobile protocols
at high price. According to the aforementioned depiction,
the traditional methods could not efﬁciently solve the prob-
lem. Some new measures are required. Vector network
(VN) [7] is a new network technique at layer 3. It can easily
solve kinds of IP’s challenges and provide the transiting
mechanism. In particular, VN’s forwarding scheme, namely
vector switching (VS, which will be described in the next
section) [7], could speedy transmit data. We take VN’s tech-
nique as the basis to boost handover. For more generalized
analysis, the basic IPv6’s mobile protocol, MIPv6, is treated
as the prototype and transferred to one modiﬁed version by
employing VS, namely Mobile Vector Network Protocol
(MVNP). Notice that all the variations of MIPv6 [2–4] can
also be used for the modiﬁcations, which is not described
here. We ﬁrst review MIPv6’s working procedure: mobile
node (MN) is assigned a home of address (HoA) by home
agent (HA) as its permanent identity. When reaching foreign
network, MN obtains a temporary identity (CoA, care of
address) allocated by the foreign agent (FA), and then MN
sends the binding update (BU) to HA who binds CoA and

HoA to support mobility. Those subsequent packets with
their destination for MN will be ﬁrst forwarded to HoA and
then sent to CoA via tunneling by HA. Finally, MN gains
the data from FA. In MVNP, MN stores the transmitting path
between HA and FA to realize fast forwarding. Its detailed
process will be described in Section 3.
Access authentication is utilized to check the validity
of the user’s identity to make sure that the user has rights
to access the network. Authentication, authorization, and
accounting (AAA) technique is designed to solve the
problems of authentication in wireless network. Many
drafts have given their designs to combine AAA and
different mobile protocols. For example, DAMIPv6 [8]
encapsulates BU message in the AAA news to reduce
the overall number of signals. Engelstad et al. [9] and
Kim et al. [10] deﬁne their own ﬂows of the AAA authen-
ticating signals. But these current authentication protocols
are mostly found on public key infrastructure [11]. This
leads to complex certiﬁcate management, various signal
exchanging, handover and authentication’s ordinal execu-
tion, home authenticating, and so on. Besides,
they
ignored the primary authenticating mechanism. For exam-
ple, it is very inefﬁcient when the mutual authentication
based on Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) [12] is desired.
Identity-based cryptography [13] proposes a new thought
for authentication, and the identity-based signature (IBS)
is also given in the same paper. However, practical
identity-based encryption and IBS/hierarchical
IBS
(HIBS) [1,14] are not realized until 2001. IBS and HIBS
let the user replace the public key with its identity and lo-
cally ﬁnish the veriﬁcation, which improves the keys’
management. In particular, HIBS ﬁts hierarchical network
well. Gentry and Silverberg [15], Zhang et al. [16] and
Boneh et al. [17] have presented their HIBS schemes, re-
spectively. In HIBS, private key generators (PKGs) are
hierarchically organized to issue the private keys for their
sons only whereas the public keys are the sons’ identity.
The signer uses its secret key to sign messages, and the
veriﬁer check whether the signature is accepted on input-
ting the signature and identity. HIBS simpliﬁes the private
keys’ management and supports the authentication of
large-scale hierarchical network. Similarly, there are also
many literatures that united IBS or HIBS with mobile
protocols. In [18], 2-IBS-HAMIPv6 is designed to apply
HIBS in HMIPv6. Zhang et al. [19] and Tian et al. [20]
give their methods in combining IBS and FMIPv6 [3]. Dang
et al. [21] achieved the ID-based registration in mobile IP
network. Although these proposals somewhat reform hand-
over performance, they also have some intrinsic ﬂaws. They
are nearly found on ﬂat network architecture and could
not efﬁciently serve hierarchical system. Tian et al. [18]
only provides service for two-layer users, whereas Zhang
et al. [19] and Tian et al. [20] need additional interactions
to acquire parameters. Moreover, we observed that
the
waiting time for the registering response was not optimized
during the parallel authentication when users were near
HAs. Most of those combinations cannot improve the hand-
over and authentication efﬁciency simultaneously.
In this paper, the cross-layered MVNP is ﬁrst designed to
implement fast registration without additional signals, based
upon which hierarchical authentication based on HIBS and
VN (HA-HIBS-VN) is proposed. HA-HIBS-VN employs
HIBS’s and VN’s fast forwarding registration to integrate
handover and access authentication. It could accomplish
the authentication in local network. Plenty of signing
and verifying values could be precomputed. The new pro-
tocol achieves the concurrent execute of registration and
authentication to optimize handover latency. There is no
need of specialized institution to administer certiﬁcates.
HA-HIBS-VN has the features of hierarchy, scalability,
and identity based. Besides, a new access router (AR)
selection algorithm is also proposed to win better hand-
over and authentication performance. The theoretical
analysis and computer simulation will also be given in this
paper. To the best known, this paper combines VN and
HIBS during the handover for the ﬁrst time.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces VN’s key techniques. Section 3 provides the
detailed description of MVNP, HA-HIBS-VN, and AR
selection algorithm. Section 4 gives the security and perfor-
mance analysis via simulation and theory. Lastly, Section 5
concludes the paper and gives the extended discussion.
2. VECTOR NETWORK’S OVERVIEW
Vector network is a type of hierarchical network technique
at network layer. It has its own unique advantages and
characteristics, for example, vector address (VA), mobility,
identiﬁer and locator separation [5], control and data plane
separation, and so on. Readers could refer to [7,22] to
know more about VN. Here, we give some key terminolo-
gies of VN from [7,22].
Identiﬁer (ID): Identiﬁer is the identity of the network node
with the characteristics of hierarchy. Similar to HoA, the
node’s global ID is globally unique.
Locator: Locator is the current location of network node.
MN must keep the locator reachable to sustain mobility
like CoA.
Peer group (PG) [23]: According to social afﬁliations or
other policies, all the network entities are organized into
different PGs in VN. These entities can be either switches/
routers or IDs. Switches/routers could form locator peer
group (Loc-PG), whereas IDs could form identiﬁer peer
group (ID-PG). There is a peer group leader (PGL) in each
PG to perform the real management operations. For example,
ID-PGL take charge of the ID’s allocation/revocation and the
mapping from ID to locator in the group. Loc-PGL controls
the topological collection and the routing path establishment.
As a rule, ID-PGL must be associated with one or several
Loc-PGLs. Note that the node’s original PG and PGL are
called home PG (HPG) and home PGL (HPGL).

Identity-based hierarchical access authentication protocol
Peer group tree (PGT): Low-layer PGLs compose the high-
layer PGs by some stated policies. These high-layer PGs
produce their own PGLs through competition mechanism.
Then the high-layer PGLs form higher-layer PGs, and so
on. At last, the PGT is output. Like PG’s division, PGT
includes locator PGT (Loc-PGT) and identiﬁer PGT (ID-
PGT). In particular, all the segments of a node’s global
ID must be found in the ID-PGT. This could be achieved
by inheriting schemes; that is, a node inherits the whole
ancestor ID-PGLs’ identiﬁer preﬁxes besides the directly
local ID. We will show the inheriting mechanism in
Figure 2.
Vector address (VA): In VN, a forwarding node (e.g.,
router, switch, host, etc) numbers its whole ports from 1
to pn (where pn 2 N is the number of forwarding node’s
ports). When data travels from source to destination, each
router in the traversal path will send the data to next hop
through a certain numbered output port. Then VA is made
up of a series of ordinal number of these output ports in the
data’s traversal path. (Notice that VA works in the form of
binary code. The binary bits of a certain port number
depends on the router’s pn.) IP address is the switching
address in IP net, whereas VA is the switching address
in VN. IP address is directly used to search routing table
to decide the routing path. However, VN employs VS to
forward data by the VA’s participation. Its procedure is
as follows. The router analyzes the output port number
from VA, deletes its own port part in VA and sends data
via the relevant port. The rest routers do the same thing
until destination is arrived. We will show how VA and
VS work in Figure 1 and Table I.
Identiﬁer peer group leader is mainly regarded for
access authentication. Therefore, PGL/PGT will just denote
ID-PGL/ID-PGT without declaration in the rest paper.
Figure 1 shows a simple model of VN. The big ellipse is a
PG, for example, PG B1. The gray circle is a PGL, for
example, B1. The white circle may be a router (transmitting
data, e.g., B3) or a PGL (standing for the low-layer PG, e.g.,
A2). The rectangle is a real mobile consumer, for example,
A21. We can see that the low-layer nodes are divided into
different PGs, and every PG has a PGL. For instance, A1
and A2 compose PG A1 where A1 is the PGL. The low-layer
PGLs also organize high-layer PG. For example, PGL A1
and PGL B1 form the high-layer PG B where B is the
PGL. Thus, the hierarchical architecture of VN is estab-
lished. The single and consecutive string in the ﬁgure is a
node’s local ID distributed by its PGL. For example, string
A21 is the local ID allocated by A2. Every node’s global
ID consists of its whole ancestors’ ID preﬁxes and the di-
rectly assigned local ID. For instance, the global ID of A21
is string A.A2.A21. Meanwhile, a node has one or more
locators, which is not shown here. The number with bracket
(e.g., 1(01), 2(10), 3(11), etc) is a certain port number
assigned by the node where binary bits in the bracket corre-
spond to the port code. For example, router B2 has three
ports numbered from 1 to 3. Then the three ports are encoded
in two binary bits, that is, 01, 10, and 11. Similarly, B1
encodes its four ports, that is, 001, 010, 011, and 100.
An ordinary communication between B11 and A21 is as
follows. B11 ﬁrst sends a call packet containing A21’s globe
ID (i.e., string A.A2.A21) to PGL B1. B1 maps A.A2.A21 to
its locator and gains the VA computed by a Loc-PGL from
B11 to A21. We take the black line as the computed path
to explain VA and VS. {B11, B1, B3, A2, A21} is a path
from B11 to A21 in the form of traversal nodes. Then it
can also be expressed by the aggregate of the outputting
ports’ numbers of all the corresponding forwarding nodes,
that is, VA = {1, 2, 2, 3}. 1, 2, 2, and 3 echo the output ports
of B11, B1, B3, and A2, respectively. (Note that B11 also
encodes its outputting port (i.e., 1) because it is a forwarding
node.) According to Figure 1, it can easily have this VA’s
binary codes, that is, {1,010,10,11}. When B11 begins to
transmit data, it analyzes VA, obtains the output port number
