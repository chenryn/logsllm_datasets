User: What is the best way to open a file as read/write if it exists, or if it does not, then create it and open it as read/write? From what I read, file = open('myfile.dat', 'rw') should do this, right?
It is not working for me (Python 2.6.2) and I'm wondering if it is a version problem, or not supposed to work like that or what.
The bottom line is, I just need a solution for the problem. I am curious about the other stuff, but all I need is a nice way to do the opening part.
The enclosing directory was writeable by user and group, not other (I'm on a Linux system... so permissions 775 in other words), and the exact error was:

IOError: no such file or directory.
Assistant: What do you want to do with file? Only writing to it or both read and write?
'w', 'a' will allow write and will create the file if it doesn't exist.
If you need to read from a file, the file has to be exist before open it. You can test its existence before opening it or use a try/except.
