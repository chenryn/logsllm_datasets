User: How to reduce server network delay and improve throughput by adjusting network card queue length and kernel parameters?
Assistant: 1. Adjust the queue length of the network card: The queue length of the network card refers to the number of data packets stored in the memory of the network card. If the queue length is too long, the delay will be increased, and if the queue length is too short, packet loss will easily occur. The network transmission throughput can be improved by adjusting the queue length of the network card. The method is as follows: - Modify the rx-queue-len and tx-queue-len parameters in the network card configuration file, you can adjust the queue length by modifying these two parameters. - To view the current queue length, you can use the ethtool tool to view it, for example: ethtool -g eth0. 2. Adjust the kernel parameters: - Modify the tcp/ip control parameters in the configuration file /etc/sysctl.conf, such as adjusting tcp_max_syn_backlog, tcp_tw_reuse and tcp_tw_recycle parameters, which can improve the network transmission throughput. - Increase the number of file handles, which can be set by modifying the parameter nofile in the file /etc/security/limits.conf. - Increase memory capacity, you can improve server performance by adding virtual memory or increasing physical memory.
