7For instance, pursuant to § 1201(a), the Library of Congress recently
approved circumvention of the technological measures contained on the
iPhone and similar wireless phone handsets known as “smartphones,” in
order to allow users to install and run third-party software applications on
these phones. See http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2010/75fr43825.pdf. 
8In addition to these four textual differences, we note that § 1201(a)(2)
prohibits the circumvention of “a technological measure,” and
§ 1201(b)(1) prohibits the circumvention “of protection afforded by a

Our reading of §§ 1201(a) and (b) ensures that neither sec-
tion is rendered superfluous. A violation of § 1201(a)(1)(A),
which prohibits circumvention itself, will not be a violation of
§ 1201(b), which does not contain an analogous prohibition
on circumvention. A violation of § 1201(a)(2), which prohib-
its trafficking in devices that facilitate circumvention of
access control measures, will not always be a violation of
§ 1201(b)(1), which prohibits trafficking in devices that facili-
tate circumvention of measures that protect against copyright
infringement. Of course, if a copyright owner puts in place an
effective measure that both (1) controls access and (2) pro-
tects against copyright infringement, a defendant who traffics
in a device that circumvents that measure could be liable
under both §§ 1201(a) and (b). Nonetheless, we read the dif-
ferences in structure between §§ 1201(a) and (b) as reflecting
Congress’s intent to address distinct concerns by creating dif-
ferent rights with different elements.
3. Our construction of the DMCA is consistent with the
legislative history
Although the text suffices to resolve the issues before us,
we also consider the legislative history in order to address the
parties’ arguments concerning it. Our review of that history
supports the view that Congress created a new anti-
circumvention right in § 1201(a)(2) independent of traditional
copyright infringement and granted copyright owners a new
weapon against copyright infringement in § 1201(b)(1). For
instance, the Senate Judiciary Committee report explains that
§§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1) are “not interchangeable”: they were
“designed to protect two distinct rights and to target two dis-
technological measure.” In our view, these terms have the same meaning,
given the presumption that a “legislative body generally uses a particular
word with a consistent meaning in a given context.” Graham County Soil
& Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 130 S. Ct.
1396, (2010) (quoting Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 243
(1972)) (internal quotation marks omitted).

tinct classes of devices,” and “many devices will be subject
to challenge only under one of the subsections.” S. Rep. No.
105-190, at 12 (1998). That is, § 1201(a)(2) “is designed to
protect access to a copyrighted work,” while § 1201(b)(1) “is
designed to protect the traditional copyright rights of the
copyright owner.” Id. Thus, the Senate Judiciary Committee
understood § 1201 to create the following regime:
[I]f an effective technological protection measure
does nothing to prevent access to the plain text of the
work, but is designed to prevent that work from
being copied, then a potential cause of action against
the manufacturer of a device designed to circumvent
the measure lies under § 1201(b)(1), but not under
§ 1201(a)(2). Conversely, if an effective technologi-
cal protection measure limits access to the plain text
of a work only to those with authorized access, but
provides no additional protection against copying,
displaying, performing or distributing the work, then
a potential cause of action against the manufacturer
of a device designed to circumvent the measure lies
under § 1201(a)(2), but not under § 1201(b).
Id. The Senate Judiciary Committee proffered an example of
§ 1201(a) liability with no nexus to infringement, stating that
if an owner effectively protected access to a copyrighted work
by use of a password, it would violate § 1201(a)(2)(A)
[T]o defeat or bypass the password and to make the
means to do so, as long as the primary purpose of the
means was to perform this kind of act. This is
roughly analogous to making it illegal to break into
a house using a tool, the primary purpose of which
is to break into houses.
Id. at 12. The House Judiciary Committee similarly states of
§ 1201(a)(2), “The act of circumventing a technological pro-
tection measure put in place by a copyright owner to control

access to a copyrighted work is the electronic equivalent of
breaking into a locked room in order to obtain a copy of a
book.” See H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt. 1, at 17 (1998). We
note that bypassing a password and breaking into a locked
room in order to read or view a copyrighted work would not
infringe on any of the copyright owner’s exclusive rights
under § 106.
We read this legislative history as confirming Congress’s
intent, in light of the current digital age, to grant copyright
owners an independent right to enforce the prohibition against
circumvention of effective technological access controls.
9 In
§ 1201(a), Congress was particularly concerned with encour-
aging copyright owners to make their works available in digi-
tal formats such as “on-demand” or “pay-per-view,” which
allow consumers effectively to “borrow” a copy of the work
for a limited time or a limited number of uses. As the House
Commerce Committee explained:
[A]n increasing number of intellectual property
works are being distributed using a “client-server”
model, where the work is effectively “borrowed” by
the user (e.g., infrequent users of expensive software
purchase a certain number of uses, or viewers watch
a movie on a pay-per-view basis). To operate in this
environment, content providers will need both the
technology to make new uses possible and the legal
framework to ensure they can protect their work
from piracy.
9Indeed, the House Commerce Committee proposed, albeit unsuccess-
fully, to move § 1201 out of Title 17 altogether “because these regulatory
provisions have little, if anything, to do with copyright law. The anti-
circumvention provisions (and the accompanying penalty provisions for
violations of them) would be separate from, and cumulative to, the exist-
ing claims available to copyright owners.” H.R. Rep. No. 105-551 (1998),
pt. 2, at 23-24.

See H.R. Rep. No. 105-551 pt. 2, at 23 (1998). 
[15] Our review of the legislative history supports our
reading of § 1201: that section (a) creates a new anti-
circumvention right distinct from copyright infringement,
while section (b) strengthens the traditional prohibition
against copyright infringement.
10 We now review the deci-
sions of the Federal Circuit that have interpreted § 1201 dif-
ferently.
4. The Federal Circuit’s decisions
The Federal Circuit has adopted a different approach to the
DMCA. In essence, it requires § 1201(a) plaintiffs to demon-
strate that the circumventing technology infringes or facili-
tates 
infringement 
of 
the 
plaintiff’s 
copyright 
(an
“infringement nexus requirement”). See Chamberlain Group,
Inc. v. Skylink Techs., Inc., 381 F.3d 1178, 1203 (Fed. Cir.
2004); Storage Tech. Corp. v. Custom Hardware Eng’g Con-
sulting, Inc., 421 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

The seminal decision is Chamberlain, 381 F.3d 1178 (Fed.
Cir. 2004). In Chamberlain, the plaintiff sold garage door
10The Copyright Office has also suggested that § 1201(a) creates a new
access control right independent from copyright infringement, by express-
ing its view that the fair use defense to traditional copyright infringement
does not apply to violations of § 1201(a)(1). U.S. Copyright Office, The
Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998: U.S. Copyright Office Sum-
mary 4 (1998), available at http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf
(“Since the fair use doctrine is not a defense to the act of gaining unautho-
rized access to a work, the act of circumventing a technological measure
in order to gain access is prohibited.”). 
11The Fifth Circuit in its subsequently withdrawn opinion in MGE UPS
Systems, Inc. v. GE Consumer and Industrial, Inc., 95 U.S.P.Q.2d 1632,
1635 (5th Cir. 2010), embraced the Federal Circuit’s approach in Cham-
berlain. However, its revised opinion, 622 F.3d (5th Cir. Sept. 20, 2010),
avoids the issue by determining that MGE had not shown circumvention
of its software protections. Notably, the revised opinion does not cite
Chamberlain.

openers (“GDOs”) with a “rolling code” security system that
purportedly reduced the risk of crime by constantly changing
the transmitter signal necessary to open the door. Id. at 1183.
Customers used the GDOs’ transmitters to send the changing
signal, which in turn opened or closed their garage doors. Id.
Plaintiff sued the defendant, who sold “universal” GDO
transmitters 
for 
use 
with 
plaintiff’s 
GDOs, 
under
§ 1201(a)(2). Id. at 1185. The plaintiff alleged that its GDOs
and transmitters both contained copyrighted computer pro-
grams and that its rolling code security system was a techno-
logical measure that controlled access to those programs. Id.
at 1183. Accordingly, plaintiff alleged that the defendant —
by selling GDO transmitters that were compatible with plain-
tiff’s GDOs — had trafficked in a technology that was pri-
marily used for the circumvention of a technological measure
(the rolling code security system) that effectively controlled
access to plaintiff’s copyrighted works. Id. 
The Federal Circuit rejected the plaintiff’s claim, holding
that the defendant did not violate § 1201(a)(2) because, inter
alia, the defendant’s universal GDO transmitters did not
infringe or facilitate infringement of the plaintiff’s copy-
righted computer programs. Id. at 1202-03. The linchpin of
the Chamberlain court’s analysis is its conclusion that DMCA
coverage is limited to a copyright owner’s rights under the
Copyright Act as set forth in § 106 of the Copyright Act. Id.
at 1192-93. Thus, it held that § 1201(a) did not grant copy-
right owners a new anti-circumvention right, but instead,
established new causes of action for a defendant’s unautho-
rized access of copyrighted material when it infringes upon a
copyright owner’s rights under § 106. Id. at 1192, 1194.
Accordingly, a § 1201(a)(2) plaintiff was required to demon-
strate a nexus to infringement — i.e., that the defendant’s traf-
ficking in circumventing technology had a “reasonable
relationship” to the protections that the Copyright Act affords
copyright owners. Id. at 1202-03. The Federal Circuit
explained:

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 30 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
Defendants who traffic in devices that circumvent
access controls in ways that facilitate infringement
may be subject to liability under § 1201(a)(2).
Defendants who use such devices may be subject to
liability under § 1201(a)(1) whether they infringe or
not. Because all defendants who traffic in devices
that circumvent rights controls necessarily facilitate
infringement, they may be subject to liability under
§ 1201(b). Defendants who use such devices may be
subject to liability for copyright infringement. And
finally, defendants whose circumvention devices do
not facilitate infringement are not subject to § 1201
liability.
Id. at 1195 (emphasis added). Chamberlain concluded that
§ 1201(a) created a new cause of action linked to copyright
infringement, rather than a new anti-circumvention right sepa-
rate from copyright infringement, for six reasons. 
First, Chamberlain reasoned that Congress enacted the
DMCA to balance the interests of copyright owners and infor-
mation users, and an infringement nexus requirement was
necessary to create an anti-circumvention right that truly
achieved that balance. Id. at 1196 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 105-
551, at 26 (1998)). Second, Chamberlain feared that copy-
right owners could use an access control right to prohibit
exclusively fair uses of their material even absent feared foul
use. Id. at 1201. Third, Chamberlain feared that § 1201(a)
would allow companies to leverage their sales into aftermar-
ket monopolies, in potential violation of antitrust law and the
doctrine of copyright misuse. Id. (citing Eastman Kodak Co.
v. Image Tech. Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 455 (1992) (antitrust);
Assessment Techs. of WI, LLC v. WIREdata, Inc., 350 F.3d
640, 647 (7th Cir. 2003) (copyright misuse)). Fourth, Cham-
berlain viewed an infringement nexus requirement as neces-
sary to prevent “absurd and disastrous results,” such as the
existence of DMCA liability for disabling a burglary alarm to
gain access to a home containing copyrighted materials. Id.

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 31 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
Fifth, Chamberlain stated that an infringement nexus
requirement might be necessary to render Congress’s exercise
of its Copyright Clause authority rational. Id. at 1200. The
Copyright Clause gives Congress “the task of defining the
scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted to
authors . . . in order to give the public appropriate access to
their work product.” Id. (citing Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S.
186, 204-05 (2003) (internal citation omitted)). Without an
infringement nexus requirement, Congress arguably would
have allowed copyright owners in § 1201(a) to deny all access
to the public by putting an effective access control measure in
place that the public was not allowed to circumvent. 
Finally, the Chamberlain court viewed an infringement
nexus requirement as necessary for the Copyright Act to be
internally consistent. It reasoned that § 1201(c)(1), enacted
simultaneously, provides that “nothing in this section shall
affect rights, remedies, limitations, or defenses to copyright
infringement, including fair use, under this title.” The Cham-
berlain court opined that if § 1201(a) creates liability for
access without regard to the remainder of the Copyright Act,
it “would clearly affect rights and limitations, if not remedies
and defenses.” Id.
Accordingly, the Federal Circuit held that a DMCA
§ 1201(a)(2) action was foreclosed to the extent that the
