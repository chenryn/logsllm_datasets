User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is related to the kernel and various software components. It begins with the kernel changing the channel to 132,+1. It then logs the ARPT, AppleThunderboltNHIType2, QQ, and AppleCamIn components. The log then records the thermal and memory pressure states of the CDScheduler, ntpd, and com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge components. The log then records the Sandbox, ARPT, AppleThunderboltGenericHAL, and AppleCamIn components. Finally, the log records the ARPT and CDScheduler components.
