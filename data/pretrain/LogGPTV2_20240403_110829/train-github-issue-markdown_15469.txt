Please consider this code:
As you can see, I need to duplicate the reference to the "rules" property in
my command, just to be able to use the (very convenient) new form tags and
still be able to convert my form objects to strings using the registered
property editors with spring:transform. Spring:transform needs its own
context, which is defined with spring:bind.
I propose to add a form:transform tag with similar syntax to spring:transform,
which uses the context of form:select (and similar) tags instead. This would
reduce the code to something like
which is much more readable and only has got one reference to the command
property.
