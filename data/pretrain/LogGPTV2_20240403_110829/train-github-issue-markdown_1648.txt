 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.10
**Visual studio Version:**
2015 community version update 2  
typescript tools for visual studio 1.8.29.0
**Code**
    any typescript code
**Expected behavior:**
Visual studio typescript debugger could correctly setup breakpoint red point
at the line I double clicked.
**Actual behavior:**
When enable `inlineSourceMap: true` in tsconfig.json, when setting a
breakpoint in VS editor, it can map that source line number from .ts file to
the corresponding line number in the .js file, however, the breakpoint red
point in the VS editor is shown on the line number in the .js file, rather
than the line number on the .ts file. Therefore, if I double click on line 100
in one .ts file, the breakpoint red point would be shown on maybe line 90 of
that .ts file, corresponding to what the mapped line number is in the
corresponding .js file.
If I disable `inlineSourceMap: true`, and enable `sourceMap: true` in
tsconfig.json, everything would be just fine.
I've noticed that there is a previous issue similar to this: #4360, and that
issue is closed. Is my configuration wrong or missing something? Thanks.
My tsconfig.json:
    {
      "compileOnSave": true,
      "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "ES5",
        "noImplicitAny": true,
        "suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors": true,
        "removeComments": false,
        "preserveConstEnums": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "noEmitOnError": true,
        // "sourceMap": true,
        "inlineSourceMap": true,
        "inlineSources": true
      }
    }
