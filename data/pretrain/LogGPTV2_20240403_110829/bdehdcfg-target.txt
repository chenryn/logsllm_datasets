### bdehdcfg: Target

**Description:**
The `bdehdcfg` command prepares a partition for use as a system drive by BitLocker and Windows Recovery. By default, this partition is created without a drive letter.

**Syntax:**
```sh
bdehdcfg -target {default|unallocated|shrink|merge}
```

**Parameters:**

- **default:**
  Indicates that the command-line tool will follow the same process as the BitLocker setup wizard.

- **unallocated:**
  Creates the system partition using the unallocated space available on the disk.

- **shrink:**
  Reduces the specified drive by the amount necessary to create an active system partition. The drive must have at least 5 percent free space to use this command.

- **merge:**
  Uses the specified drive as the active system partition. The operating system drive cannot be a target for the merge operation.

**Examples:**

- To designate an existing drive (P:) as the system drive:
  ```sh
  bdehdcfg -target P: merge
  ```
