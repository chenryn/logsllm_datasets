When attempting to trace a model, I encountered the following error:
```
TracedModules don't support parameter sharing between modules
```

Upon investigating the JIT (Just-In-Time) module source code, I discovered that this error is triggered when:
- The module's weights are already in a set, but their ID differs from an existing one.

However, the error message is misleading. It is not actually related to parameter sharing. Instead, it occurs because two or more modules have the same weights but different IDs.

To better assist users in resolving this issue, the error message should at least indicate which layers or modules are in conflict due to having the same weights but different IDs.

If you encounter the same error while tracing a PyTorch model, please consider upvoting my suggestion to improve the error message.
