When I try trace a model, I got this error:
    TracedModules don't support parameter sharing between modules
After digging into jit module source codes, this error thrown for the reason
that:
    the module weights already inside a set, but id is different with exists one, then out performs this error
however, this message is confusing. I think **it's nothing to do with
parameters sharing, instead, it because of 2 modules or more with same weights
but not same id**.
I think the best way to indicates users to solve this, at least provide which
layer or which modules conflicts with each other since they have same weights
but not same id.
If you got same error when tracing a pytorch model. You should think about
give my advise a üëç
