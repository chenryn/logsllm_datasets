Hello there,
I'm attempting to integrate `react-notification-system` with next.
`react-notification-system` requires you to have this component at the root of
the app. Given that next.js apps are organised in pages it seems to be
impossible to do this. If `react-notification-system` is initialised on each
individual page then you lose the notifications when routing between pages.
I attempted to initialise this within `pages/_document.js` but it appears that
this is only used server side for the initial render.
Is there any way to hook into the `App` or `Container` component at the root?
For now i've had to add a rather hacky `ReactDOM.render` which is less than
ideal...
