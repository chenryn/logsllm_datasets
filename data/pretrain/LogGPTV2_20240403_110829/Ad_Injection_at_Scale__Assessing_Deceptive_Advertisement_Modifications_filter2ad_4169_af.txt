**Note:** We obtain more comprehensive coverage of affiliates in client traffic than via our synthetic execution environment.

### Estimating Coverage of Ad Injection Software
While we cast a wide net for ad injection software, our understanding of the ecosystem is biased by the input sources used by WebEval, Hulk, and Safe Browsing. We estimate our overall coverage by comparing the affiliate parameters that appear in extensions and binaries against those appearing in client DOMs analyzed in Section IV. Our results are shown in Table VI. 

- **Coverage per Affiliate Program:**
  - For superfish.com, we identify 149 IDs in our dynamic extension traces, which correlate with the same IDs in 88% of client DOMs.
  - The same analysis for binaries yields 21 affiliates accounting for 64% of client DOMs.
  - Limited affiliates found for visadd.com and clkmon.com may result from insufficient browser interaction to elicit network traces with affiliate IDs.

Our results indicate that we have a substantial sample of ad injection software, though we do not have complete coverage of all affiliate distribution techniques in the wild. Between extensions and binaries, our extensions dataset provides the best coverage of affiliates and ad injection programs.

### Identifying Advertisers and Intermediaries
Money enters the ad injection ecosystem through a complex web of advertisers and intermediaries. We explore ads injected on Google, Amazon, and Walmart and identify over 3,000 websites that unwittingly purchase traffic from injectors. Advertisers rarely have insight into the provenance of traffic; they only observe parameters tied to the last hop (e.g., HTTP redirect with a referrer) of the full clickchain. Accordingly, we illuminate the full chain of ad relationships that underpin the injection ecosystem and highlight the intermediaries who can have the greatest impact on blocking deceptively sourced traffic.

#### Ads Injected on Amazon, Google, & Walmart
- **Total Revenue Chains Aggregated:**
  - 114,999 revenue chains from 398 extensions into Google, Amazon, and Walmart.
  - Detailed breakdown in Table VII.

- **Trigger Pages:**
  - 86% of 300 trigger pages successfully induce an injected ad.
  - Average elements per page:
    - 5 iframe ads
    - 110 divs
    - 0.4 flash ads
    - 15 ad URLs

- **Revenue Chain Example:**
  - When visiting google.com and querying for "Android," the Superfish injection library triggers and fetches a list of advertisements.
  - Clicking a BestBuy offer initiates a redirect chain through multiple intermediaries, ultimately landing at BestBuy.
  - Injection libraries then embed rogue advertisements on bestbuy.com, despite being paid by BestBuy to deliver traffic.

### Advertisers and Intermediaries for Top Injectors
Given the diversity of revenue paths available to injection libraries, we narrow our analysis towards the advertisers and intermediaries impacted by the top 3 injected ad domains in our revenue chains. These contribute 77% of all injected ads from 81% of extensions.

- **Traffic Entry Points into the Ad Ecosystem:**
  - Ad injection traffic enters the ad ecosystem through a small number of paths, detailed in Table IX.
  - Superfish.com funnels all its traffic through three shopping programs: DealTime, PriceGrabber, and BizRate (also known as ShopZilla).
  - BizRate is also used by dealply.com (67%) and datafastguru.com (43%).

- **Intermediaries:**
  - The most popular intermediary is channelintelligence.com, a Google-owned property, followed by pronto.com.
  - AppNexus (adnxs.com) and DoubleClick (a Google ad exchange) are also notable intermediaries.

- **Advertisers Negatively Impacted:**
  - A handful of advertisers are the primary landing pages for traffic from ad injectors, detailed in Table X.
