I recently encountered an issue with the `curve_fit` function in Scipy, where it failed to fit a function despite providing reasonable initial guesses. The warning message from Scipy was as follows:

```
/usr/local/depot/Python-3.5.1/lib/python3.5/site-packages/scipy/optimize/minpack.py:690: OptimizeWarning: Covariance of the parameters could not be estimated.
```

After several hours of troubleshooting, I discovered that the problem stemmed from using `np.float32` arrays for the x and y data. Converting the x data to `np.float64` using `x.astype(np.float64)` resolved the issue. Unfortunately, the warning message provided no indication or hints about the root cause.

This issue is similar to one reported in an older email thread: [curve_fit with float32 values](http://scipy-user.scipy.narkive.com/wSafjCiz/curve-fit-with-float32-values). This thread was challenging to find, and it would be beneficial to include a warning in the `curve_fit` documentation (and other minimization functions) about potential issues with `float32` inputs. This is especially important because the problem only manifests with certain datasets.
