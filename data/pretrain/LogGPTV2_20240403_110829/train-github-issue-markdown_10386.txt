Matlab has `cholupdate` for rank 1 updates and downdates to Cholesky
factorizations. It would be nice to have something similar, but perhaps with
better syntax.
LINPACK had these, but LAPACK left out the Cholesky update/downdate
capabilities.

For the dense case, perhaps these should be implemented in julia. For the
sparse case, I believe that CHOLMOD does provide these capabilities.

  * Sparse Cholesky
  * Dense QR (actually there are three different storage schemes)
