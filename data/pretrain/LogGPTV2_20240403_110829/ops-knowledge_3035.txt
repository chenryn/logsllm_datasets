Question: "Consider a web application that uses block cipher encryption to protect sensitive data in transit. One of the application's functionalities allows users to submit encrypted data, which the server decrypts and processes accordingly. An attacker observes that when malformed padding in an encrypted data block is submitted, the server responds with different error messages depending on the nature of the padding error. What kind of security vulnerability is the application likely exposing, and what potential risks does it introduce?"
 "A": "The application is likely exposing a padding oracle vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to decrypt data without the encryption key."
 "B": "The application is likely exposing a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
 "C": "The application is likely exposing a SQL injection vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to access the backend database."
 "D": "The application is likely exposing a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user."
Answer: A
