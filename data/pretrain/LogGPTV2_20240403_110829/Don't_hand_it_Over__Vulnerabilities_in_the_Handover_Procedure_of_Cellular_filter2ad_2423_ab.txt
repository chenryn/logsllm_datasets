ping-pong handovers [26, 50]. As solution to avoid such situations,
3GPP specifications have proposed a set of predefined measurement
report mechanisms, called Events, to be performed by the UE. The
type of event a UE has to report is specified by the Radio Resource
Control (RRC) signaling message sent by the base station. Section A
(Appendix) illustrates these events in LTE and 5G.
Handover Phases: Before the handover procedure takes place,
the UE is attached to the source base station with its established
radio bearers. It is in RRC-Connected state (and registered state)
and uplink/downlink data are relayed normally between the UE
and the network. Then, the handover procedure consists of three
phases:
(1) The preparation phase corresponds to the decision of han-
dover, information exchange and resource reservation. The
preparation phase begins when the decision is taken to ex-
ecute a handover procedure after the UE’s measurement
reports.
(2) The execution phase corresponds to the mobile connection
to the target eNodeB/gNodeB. It begins with the source base
station sending the RRC Reconfiguration message to the UE.
(3) The completion phase consists of the establishment of final
bearers and the release of the old resources. It starts when the
UE transmits the RRC Reconfiguration Complete message.
2.1 Handover Classification
According to the specifications [5, 17], cellular handovers can be
classified according to three primary factors, detailed as follows:1
Intra- and Inter-Base Station Handover: Base stations may
be a gNodeB, eNodeB or BSS/RNC including their sub-types (en-
gNodeB, ng-eNodeB, etc). Handovers can then be classified as Inter-
Base Station, where the UE relocates to a cell belonging to a different
base station, or Intra-Base Station, where the UE relocates to a dif-
ferent cell but operated by the same base station. Intra-Base Station
handovers comprise a simple exchange of reconfiguration messages
between the UE and the serving base station without adhering to
the regular handover procedure. Also, this process lacks the need of
a target base station, so we can completely distinguish it from Inter-
Base Station. On the contrary, Inter-Base Station handovers follow
the normal handover procedure. Inter-Base Station handovers need
to be classified further in order to determine the target system that
will handle the connection after the handover. Therefore, all the
types below are mainly applicable to them.
Intra- and Inter-Core Network Handover: Core Network en-
tities that handle authentication and sessions may also need to
change leading to Inter-Core Network handovers. For example, the
serving Access and Mobility Function (AMF in 5G) or Mobility
Management Entity (MME in LTE) may need to change because
the target base station belongs to another AMF or MME. Intra-Core
Network handovers do not demand Core Network relocations be-
cause the target base station is under control of the current network,
while Inter-Core Network handovers perform relocations because
the target base station belongs to a different Core Network entity.
1To make our evaluation more coherent, in this paper we also group the legacy
technologies (2G and 3G) together as one unified system with a 2G/3G SGSN, MSC,
BSS and RNC stations, especially due to their current phase out. Otherwise, these two
generations hold different but connected Core and RAN networks.
Core Network relocations always require the relocation of the
entity that manages the access and mobility (such as AMF and
MME) and controls the target base station. For instance, a relocation
from a 5G Core Network to another is characterised as Inter-AMF
handover because of this AMF shift. In fact, the terms Intra/Inter-
Core Network are not necessary when we know the relocation
state of the AMFs/MMEs/SGSNs. In cases where a Core Network
may have more than one authentication and mobility management
entity, it is possible for a UE to shift between them according to
network needs. This means that an Intra-Core Network handover
could also be Inter-MME or Inter-AMF.
Besides that, it is common for a UE to also change its assigned
user-plane gateway and function. This may happen inside the same
network or when the Core Network changes. For example, if the
UE is assigned a new UPF within the same 5G network then we
can define this handover as Intra-AMF Inter-UPF. This is applicable
to any generation. Worth mentioning is the fact that this kind
of relocation is neither transparent to the UE nor will it require
any additional steps from UE’s side during the handover, as the
authentication and mobility management entity will complete this
appointment directly. Exactly the same is applicable to the SMF
function in 5G.
Intra- and Inter-RAT Handover: Finally, based on a distinc-
tion due to the Radio Access Technology, Intra-RAT refers to a
handover destined for a target network entity that uses the same
radio technology as the source network, while the Inter-RAT refers
to a handover destined for a network entity that uses a different
radio technology. For instance, an Inter-RAT handover is the EPS
fallback from a 5G connectivity.
2.2 Special Handover Types
In addition to the presented normal handovers, the following special
– subsumed – handover types exist, with related security concerns
as we will demonstrate.
Conditional Handovers. According to release 16 [10] a Condi-
tional Handover (CHO) is a handover that is executed by the UE
when one or more handover execution conditions are met. The
source base station sends the execution condition(s) to the UE
through the RRC Reconfiguration and then the UE starts evaluating
them. Once one of the conditions is fulfilled, a handover is executed.
Also, after sending the RRC Reconfiguration message, the source
base station prepares all potential handovers by sending handover
requests to the candidate cell(s). The CHO configuration contains
the configuration of the CHO candidate cell(s) generated by the
candidate base stations and execution condition(s) generated by the
source base station. The UE determines the best candidate based
on the threshold using the typical signal metrics (e. g., RSRP, RSRQ,
RSSI, SINR). Also, a candidate cell may be operated by the source or
candidate base stations. Finally, an execution condition may consist
of one or two trigger condition(s) (CHO events A3/A5, as defined
in [7]).
CU-DU gNodeB Handovers (5G). In the 5G RAN architec-
ture, the gNodeB has been split into smaller specialized units, the
Centralized Unit (CU) and the Distributed Unit (DU). The CU is
a logical node that includes gNodeB functions such as user data
transfer, mobility control, radio access network sharing, positioning,

session management etc., except from those allocated exclusively
to the DU. In addition, the CU controls the operation of DU(s)
over the front-haul interface. Contrariwise, the DU (also known
as RRH/RRU/RE/RU) is a logical node that includes a subset of the
gNodeB functions depending on the functional split option.
According to 3GPP [6] a handover may be Intra-gNodeB (Intra-
CU) Intra/Inter-DU or Inter-gNodeB (Inter-CU) Inter-DU. This
means that the target DU is either controlled by the same gNodeB
or by a neighboring gNodeB, thus a CU relocation may be needed
too.
3 THREAT MODEL
We consider an adversary that has the capacity to establish a MitM
relay, which in turn may allow him/her to eavesdrop, drop, modify
and forward messages transmitted between benign participants
(e. g., genuine user equipment and base stations) in the public chan-
nel while adhering to the cryptographic assumptions. In addition,
we consider an active adversary who can install and operate a
base station with the same capabilities as a legitimate one. Specif-
ically, the fake station can impersonate a legitimate base station
and thus force a victim’s device to connect to it by broadcasting
MIB and SIB messages in the victim UE’s frequency with a higher
signal strength than the legitimate base station. We also make the
assumption that the attacker is able to capture the MIB and SIB
messages by eavesdropping the public channels. He/She may utilize
any available equipment to carry out attacks. Finally, we assume
that the adversary cannot physically tamper the SIM card, base
station, or the Core Network to obtain the sensitive information,
e. g., cryptographic session keys, and we consider side-channel and
signal jamming attacks as out of scope.

In this section we describe the holistic view of our attack. We
propose a methodology that focuses not only on exploiting the
