explore the high-level intent of the domain’s registrant. For each
domain, we infer what motivated its registrant to spend money on
the name. We classify registration intent into one of three broad
categories:
Defensive registrants purchased a new domain to defend an
existing Web presence.
Primary registrants own domains with the intent to estab-
lish a Web presence.
Speculative registrants intend to proﬁt off of the name itself
and never plan to develop a meaningful Web presence.
Before classifying domains by registration intent into one of the
above categories, we must remove some types of domains. We ig-
nore domains in the “Unused” and “HTTP Error” categories. We
could guess that these domains tend to include more defensive than
primary motivations since they are not user-ready and therefore the
use of the name is the only relevant effect on the Internet. How-
ever, registrants likely buy domains they intend to develop all the
time, and these domain names may transition to other categoriza-
tions given time or result in expirations.
We also ignore domains in the “Free” content category before
deciding registration intent. In a typical domain registration sce-
nario, we know registrants have expressed genuine interest in the
domains they own because they paid money for them. Without ig-
noring the “Free” content category, we could not use the results of
our registrant intent classiﬁcations to make any claims about why
registrants purchase domain names.
Table 8 summarizes our results. In the following sections, we de-
scribe each registration intent category in more detail. We discuss
what types of registrants we expect each category to cover and how
we map content categories to registration intents for each domain.

Table 8: Registration intent categorizations for the new public
TLDs.
6.1 Defensive
Our defensive registration intent set begins with domains that
redirect to a different domain name. Some off-domain redirects
could reﬂect primary registrations: registrants could use their old
name for technical or historical reasons but primarily use and mar-
ket the new domain name. However, we ﬁnd in practice that most
are defensive, and many lead to sites whose branding and headers
clearly advertise the landing domain.4
Additionally, we include domains that return invalid DNS results
in this set. Owners of non-resolving domains could only use their
names for private purposes, since trafﬁc routed through the public
Internet cannot correctly address a remote server. A more likely
explanation is that the registrant only cares about the name. We in-
clude domains with invalid NS records as well as those that do not
appear in the zone ﬁle (both described in Section 5.3.1), for a to-
tal of 774,574 non-resolving domains. Combined with the 236,380
defensive redirects, we ﬁnd defensive registrations of 1,010,954 do-
mains in the new TLDs.
6.2 Primary
Primary domains include all those purchased by a registrant with
the intent to use that speciﬁc domain. Most primary registrants pur-
chased their domain to establish a Web presence, but there are other
kinds of primary registrants as well. We only classify domains in
our “Content” category as primary registrations. Each of these do-
mains resolves and could conceivably host content intended for end
users. Our clustering technique did not ﬁnd similar Web content for
these domains, so registrants of those domains at a minimum host
sufﬁciently unique content.
6.3 Speculative
Many registrants purchase domains to speculate on the domain
itself with no intent to develop content. Most make use of the ﬁrst-
come ﬁrst-served nature of domain registrations to grab domains
they believe others will ﬁnd desirable in the hope of selling them
later for a proﬁt. Others host parking-based advertising and pay-
per-redirect services with the goal of monetizing through ad rev-
enue, but still with no intent to develop unique content. In practice,
most speculators in the ﬁrst case also host parked content because
it is essentially free (and often bundled with domain registration
fees), and also serves as a signal to prospective buyers that the name
is available.
From a content standpoint, the difference between a defensive
and speculative registration is relatively narrow. Defensive regis-
trants purchase domains to defend the string but with no intent to
develop content, while speculative registrants purchase domains to
resell later with no intent to develop content. However, speculative
registrants are monetarily motivated on a per-domain margin, while
defensive registrants have revenues outside the domain business. A
4Trademark holders make defensive registrations on their own
brands. The same registration made by a different actor with mali-
cious intent would instead qualify as cybersquatting.

speculator must monetize the name, but a defender does not. There-
fore, we classify parked domains as speculative and non-resolving
domains as defensive based on this distinction.
7. REGISTRATION COSTS
Previously, we focused on the new TLD system from a registrant-
centric perspective. In this section we look at the new TLD rollout
from the point of view of the registries. We examine how registries
make money and how they interact with registrars in practice.
7.1 Registry Financials
Using the methodology described in Section 3.7, we obtained
pricing information for 2,006 (TLD, registrar) pairs, which account
for 73.8% of all domain registrations. In only four TLDs do we
record prices from fewer than three registrars; in each case, how-
ever, the one or two registrars we do record account for at least
97.5% of all domains. In the remaining 26.2% of domain registra-
tions for which we do not have matching data, we use the median
price for the TLD.
Figure 4 shows a complementary cumulative distribution func-
tion of the cost to registrants per TLD. A point on the line shows
the ratio of new TLDs that have made at least the correspond-
ing amount in registration costs. We included a vertical line at
$185,000 USD, the standard application fee for a new TLD [19].
At this cost, roughly half of all TLDs made this money back. We
estimate the total cost to registrants for domains in the new TLDs
at $89 million USD through March 2015.
The application fee, however, only represents a lower bound on
the amount each registry spent on their TLD. Additional costs to
ICANN include a quarterly $6,250 fee [5], a per-domain transac-
tion fee for registries with more than 50,000 transactions per year (a
threshold only 18 TLDs have met), and additional application fees
for TLDs that must enter the contention process. While registries
do not have many other explicit costs, the TLD application process
ran for years before the ﬁrst delegation; presumably registries built
up legal or personnel costs in the meantime. Registries also need to
connect with registrars, market and brand their TLDs, build a Web
presence, and run or outsource technical operations.
As a result, we also include 500,000 USD as a more realistic esti-
mate for the cost of establishing a new TLD. While it is conjecture,
some TLDs have already gone up for auction, like reise [23] and
Figure 5: A histogram of renewal rates per TLD.
versicherung [4], which set reserve prices of 400,000 USD and
750,000 USD, respectively. Given the small number of registra-
tions each had at the time, these TLDs were valuable because they
had completed the delegation process, suggesting the sale price
roughly reﬂects the cost of delegation. With these reserve prices,
we chose 500,000 USD as a rounded estimate in this range. At this
estimate, only about 10% of TLDs are proﬁtable.
Revenue from domain registrations does not all go to the registry.
Instead, registries and registrars split revenue based on a previously
agreed upon model. For instance, Verisign makes $7.85 USD per
com registration [6] and $6.79 per net registration [18]. During our
pricing data collection, we found registration prices for both com
and net names ranging from $8 to $13 USD, or markups ranging
from $0.15 to $6.5
Unfortunately, the new registry agreements do not specify max-
imum wholesale prices, only fees the registry must pay to ICANN.
For calibration, we can get a handful of prices through registry-
reported earning data. Rightside, one of the largest back-end reg-
istry providers, is funded through private investors and has released
some revenue statistics online in a presentation meant for investors
and analysts [25]. They provide end-of-November wholesale and
total revenue numbers for ﬁve TLDs, two of them aggregated. Our
estimate is too low for reviews,6 but our other estimates over-
estimate the wholesale price by close to a factor of 1.4. Our model
does not factor in premium domain name sales, a non-trivial rev-
enue source that does not correlate well with wholesale price. As
a result, Figure 4 represents a low estimate of domain name costs,
and we discuss the limitations of our model further in Section 7.4.
7.2 Renewal Rates
All registries in the new gTLD program anticipated the one year
and 45 day mark since the introduction of the earliest TLDs [2].7
This milestone provides the ﬁrst chance for registrants in the new
TLDs to renew their domain names, and hence reﬂects ongoing de-
5Registries can offer “bulk discounts and marketing support and in-
centive programs” but must offer similar terms to all registrars [6].
6The price we found for reviews domains through two registrars
owned by the same company as Rightside is less than its wholesale
price. We found pricing for November through archive.org [17]
and found that the price to registrants of a review domain has
halved. We do not know if this reﬂects a reduction in its whole-
sale price or a promotion.
7The extra 45 days is for the Auto-Renew Grace Period, which al-
lows registrars to keep the registrations for free. Usually the regis-
trar uses this time to offer the registrant one last chance for renewal,
in case they let it expire accidentally.

models. A point on a line indicates the fraction of TLDs that were

mand for domains in the new TLDs after one year’s actual, rather
than anticipated, experience with the domains. Donuts, the largest
registry with over a hundred new TLDs, published statistics on re-
newal rates for their earliest TLDs [10, 24], likely in an attempt to
attract registrars and investors [30]. However, Donuts limited their
analysis to their own TLDs, and also did not provide numbers past
26 days.
Figure 5 shows a histogram of renewal rates by TLD. We only
performed our analysis on TLDs where at least a hundred domains
completed a full year of registrations plus the 45-day Auto-Renew
Grace Period. The Donuts TLDs in our data set show renewal rates
within a few percentage points of the numbers Donuts reported in
April. We calculate an overall renewal rate of 71%.
7.3 Future Proﬁt Modeling
In this section, we take a look at registry proﬁtability using a va-
riety of parameters. In face of the limitations of our proﬁt model-
ing discussed in Section 7.4, we acknowledge that drawing higher-
order conclusions from such limited data could lead to models that
are incorrect in unpredictable ways. However, we would still like to
attempt to classify “successful” TLDs, and proﬁtability is a strong
indicator of the success of any company.
We start by graphing TLD proﬁtability over time under four dif-
ferent models in Figure 6. A point on a line indicates the fraction
of TLDs that were proﬁtable within the given time since general
availability. We show four curves that reﬂect different values for
two parameters. Two of the models assume an initial cost to the
registry of only 185,000 USD, or the amount of the ICANN ap-
plication fee. This is the minimum amount we know all registries
must pay. The other models assume an initial cost of 500,000 USD,
which better reﬂects our understanding of the cost of creating a reg-
istry. The second parameter is renewal rates. We show models with
renewal rates of 57% and 79%, which reﬂect lower and higher than
average rates and show the sensitivity of the model to renewals.
For each TLD, we collect registration volume data from the re-
ports provided via ICANN. We consider TLDs for which we have
three monthly reports after general availability. The ﬁrst month
typically contains a burst of registrations, and then the second and
third provide two data points at a more typical registration rate. We
model future months based on new registrations at this rate, and
renewals of domains registered or renewed 12 months prior at the
indicated renewal rate. We estimate the wholesale price as 70% of
the total price at the cheapest registrar.
