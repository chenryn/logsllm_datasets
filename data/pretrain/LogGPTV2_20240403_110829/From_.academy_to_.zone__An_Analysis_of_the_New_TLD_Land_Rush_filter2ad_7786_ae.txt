### Exploring the High-Level Intent of Domain Registrants

For each domain, we aim to infer the primary motivation behind the registrant's decision to purchase the name. We classify these motivations into three broad categories:

1. **Defensive Registrants**: These individuals or entities acquire a new domain to protect an existing online presence.
2. **Primary Registrants**: These registrants own domains with the intent to establish a new web presence.
3. **Speculative Registrants**: These registrants intend to profit from the domain name itself, often without plans to develop a meaningful web presence.

#### Pre-Classification Filtering

Before categorizing the domains, we exclude certain types of domains:
- **Unused and HTTP Error Domains**: These domains are not user-ready and may have been purchased primarily for defensive reasons. However, some of these domains might transition to other categories over time or eventually expire.
- **Free Content Domains**: In typical domain registration scenarios, registrants express genuine interest by paying for the domain. Including free content domains would skew our analysis, as they do not reflect the same level of financial commitment.

#### Summary of Registration Intent Categorizations

| Intent       | Number of Domains | Percentage |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Primary      | 372,569           | 14.6%      |
| Defensive    | 1,010,954         | 39.7%      |
| Speculative  | 1,161,892         | 45.6%      |
| **Total**    | 2,545,415         | 100.0%     |

### Detailed Analysis of Registration Intent Categories

#### 6.1 Defensive Registrations

Defensive registrations typically include domains that redirect to a different domain name. While some off-domain redirects might be used for technical or historical reasons, most are defensive in nature, often leading to sites that clearly advertise the landing domain. Additionally, we classify domains with invalid DNS results (non-resolving domains) as defensive. These domains could only be used for private purposes, but more likely, the registrant is primarily interested in the name itself. Our dataset includes 774,574 non-resolving domains and 236,380 defensive redirects, totaling 1,010,954 defensive registrations in the new TLDs.

#### 6.2 Primary Registrations

Primary registrations are those purchased with the intent to use the specific domain to establish a web presence. We classify domains in the "Content" category as primary, as they resolve and can host content intended for end users. Our clustering technique indicates that these domains host sufficiently unique content.

#### 6.3 Speculative Registrations

Speculative registrants purchase domains with the intent to profit from the name itself, often without developing any content. They take advantage of the first-come, first-served nature of domain registrations to acquire names they believe others will find desirable, hoping to sell them later for a profit. Some speculative registrants also host parking-based advertising and pay-per-redirect services to monetize through ad revenue. The key difference between defensive and speculative registrations is that speculative registrants are motivated by per-domain profit, while defensive registrants have broader business interests. We classify parked domains as speculative and non-resolving domains as defensive based on this distinction.

### 7. Registration Costs

#### 7.1 Registry Financials

We obtained pricing information for 2,006 (TLD, registrar) pairs, accounting for 73.8% of all domain registrations. For the remaining 26.2%, we use the median price for the TLD. Figure 4 shows a complementary cumulative distribution function of the cost to registrants per TLD, with a vertical line at $185,000 USD, the standard application fee for a new TLD. At this cost, roughly half of all TLDs have made this money back. We estimate the total cost to registrants for domains in the new TLDs at $89 million USD through March 2015.

The application fee represents a lower bound on the amount each registry spent. Additional costs include quarterly fees, per-domain transaction fees, and additional application fees for TLDs entering the contention process. Registries also incur costs for legal, personnel, marketing, and technical operations. A more realistic estimate for establishing a new TLD is $500,000 USD. At this estimate, only about 10% of TLDs are profitable.

#### 7.2 Renewal Rates

All registries in the new gTLD program anticipated the one-year and 45-day mark since the introduction of the earliest TLDs. This milestone provides the first chance for registrants to renew their domain names, reflecting ongoing demand. Donuts, the largest registry, published statistics on renewal rates for their earliest TLDs. Figure 5 shows a histogram of renewal rates by TLD, with an overall renewal rate of 71%.

#### 7.3 Future Profit Modeling

We model TLD profitability using various parameters, acknowledging the limitations of our model. Figure 6 shows TLD profitability over time under four different models, reflecting different values for initial costs and renewal rates. We consider TLDs for which we have three monthly reports after general availability, modeling future months based on new registrations and renewals. We estimate the wholesale price as 70% of the total price at the cheapest registrar.

This comprehensive approach allows us to better understand the motivations and financial dynamics of domain registrants and registries in the new TLD landscape.
