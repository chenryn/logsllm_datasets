formance of Sybil defense schemes and how attackers with
knowledge of the structure of the social network can leverage
it to launch more eﬃcient Sybil attacks.
Since social network-based Sybil defense schemes use the
structure of social networks to distinguish the Sybil nodes
from the non-Sybil nodes, we begin by asking the following
question: Are there networks where it is hard to tell these
two types of nodes apart? In other words, could there be net-
works where the non-Sybil nodes look like Sybils or where it
would be easy for Sybil nodes to masquerade as non-Sybils?
Intuitively, one would expect networks where the non-
Sybil region is comprised of multiple, small, tightly-knit
communities that are interconnected sparsely to be more
vulnerable to Sybil attacks. In such networks, nodes within
one community might mistake non-Sybil nodes in another
community for Sybils, due to limited connectivity between
the communities. Furthermore, an attacker can easily dis-
guise Sybil nodes as just another community in the network
by establishing a small number of carefully targeted links
to the community containing the trusted node. Next, we
verify this intuition using experiments over synthetic and
real-world social networks where the non-Sybil nodes have
diﬀerent community structures and the Sybil nodes use dif-
ferent attack strategies.
Figure 10: Illustrations of the synthetic networks
used in Section 5.1 (the actual networks are much
larger). Non-Sybils are dark green and Sybils light
orange. While the non-Sybil regions of (a), (b), and
(c) show increasing amounts of community struc-
ture, all non-Sybil regions have the same number of
nodes and links, and degree distribution.
5.1 Impact of social network structure
We ﬁrst examine the sensitivity of Sybil defense schemes to
the structure of the non-Sybil region. As in Sections 3 and
4, we analyze synthetic networks and then show that the
results from these simple cases apply to real-world networks
as well.
We ﬁrst generate a B´arab´asi-Albert random synthetic net-
work [4] with 512 nodes and initial degree m = 8. This
results in a random power-law network with approximately
3,900 links, and without any community structure. We then
iteratively generate a series of networks by rewiring [3] ﬁve
links in same manner as in Section 3 (resulting in a network),
then rewiring ﬁve more links (resulting in another network),
and so on, until only ﬁve links remain between the two com-
munities of 256 nodes each (resulting in a ﬁnal network).
The output is a series of networks that all have the same
number of nodes, number of links, and degree distribution,
but are increasing in the level of community structure that
they exhibit. Figure 10 gives a illustration of the initial,
intermediate, and ﬁnal networks.
We use this series of networks to evaluate how well
Sybil defense schemes perform on networks with increasing
amounts of community structure. To do so, we treat each
of these networks as the non-Sybil region, and we randomly
attach a Sybil region of 256 nodes using 40 links. We then
evaluate how well the existing schemes are able to detect
Sybils by using the A′ metric. The result of this experi-

their links closer to the trusted node.
ment for the ﬁnal 16 networks are shown in Figure 11. It
can clearly be seen that the Sybil defense schemes perform
much better in the networks with less community structure
than in those with more community structure. In fact, when
there is a high level of community structure, the Sybil de-
fense schemes perform close to what would be expected with
a random ranking (indicated by a A′ value of 0.5). Thus, the
eﬀectiveness of these schemes is very sensitive to the level of
community structure present in the non-Sybil region of the
network.
Next, we examine whether this observation holds in real-
world networks. To do so, we collected a set of real-world
networks that have varying levels of community structure,
shown in Table 3.
In order to measure the level of com-
munity structure present in the networks, we use the well-
known metric modularity [26]. In brief, modularity ranges
between -1 and 1, with 0 representing no more community
structure than a random graph. Strongly positive values
indicate signiﬁcant community structure and strongly nega-
tive values indicate less community structure than a random
graph. As can be observed in the table, these eight networks
have modularity value ranging from 0.28 to 0.79, indicating
moderate to strong levels of community structure.
We conducted a similar experiment to the one above,
treating these networks as the non-Sybil region, attaching
a Sybil region, and evaluating the accuracy of Sybil defense.
However, since these networks are of very diﬀerent scales, we
created a power-law Sybil region for each network with one-
quarter the number of Sybils as there are non-Sybils, and at-
tached these Sybil regions to the non-Sybils randomly with

a number links equal to 5% of the links between non-Sybil
nodes.
The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 12. We
observe a clear trend: As the level of community structure
increases, evidenced by increasing modularity, the perfor-
mance of the Sybil defense schemes falls close to random.
In fact, a correlation coeﬃcient of -0.81 is observed between
the modularity value and the A′ metric, demonstrating that
increasing levels of community structure are strongly anti-
correlated with the ability to distinguish Sybils. This poor
accuracy also corresponds well with recent work [23] that
has suggested that many real-world networks may not be as
fast-mixing as was previously thought. Thus, as observed
above for synthetic networks, Sybil defense schemes are ex-
tremely sensitive to the level of community structure present
in real-world networks as well.
5.2 Resilience to targeted Sybil attacks
We now examine the sensitivity of Sybil defense schemes to
Sybil attacks that leverage knowledge of the structure of the
social network to establish links to a targeted subset of nodes
in the network. Recall that all schemes assume that the Sybil
nodes are allowed to create only a bounded number of links
to non-Sybils. When evaluating the schemes, the authors
of these schemes assume that the attacker establishes these
links to random nodes in the network. We now explore how
this one aspect of the attack model (random link placement
to non-Sybils) can aﬀect the performance of Sybil defense
schemes by allowing the Sybils a level of control over where
those links are placed. As before, we ﬁrst examine the be-
havior using synthetic networks and then examine real-world
networks.
To create the synthetic network, we use the methodology
from Section 5.1, with rewiring done until only 40 links re-
main between the two communities of 256 nodes each. We
then create a series of scenarios where we increasingly allow
the Sybils more control over where their links to non-Sybils
are placed. Speciﬁcally, instead of requiring the Sybil links
to be placed randomly over the entire non-Sybil region, we
allow the Sybils to place these links randomly among the k
nodes closest to the trusted node, where closeness is deﬁned
by the ranking given by the community detection algorithm
used in Section 4. In all cases, the number of Sybil-to-non-
Sybil links remains the same. Thus, as k is reduced, the
Sybils are allowed to target their links closer to the trusted
node. We then calculate the accuracy of the Sybil defense
schemes. An illustration of these networks is shown in Fig-
ure 13.
371Figure 14 presents the results of this experiment. We see a
decrease in accuracy as the Sybils are allowed to place their
links closer to the trusted node. This is a result of the Sybil
nodes being placed higher in the Sybil defense scheme’s rank-
ing, and therefore being less likely to be detected. From this
simple experiment, it is clear that the performance of Sybil
defense schemes is highly dependent on the attack model,
depending (for example) on not just upon the number of
links the attacker can form, but on how well those links can
be targeted.
We then repeat the same experiment using the Facebook
graduate student network. The results of this experiment
are shown in Figure 15, and are even more striking than the
previous experiment. As the attackers are allowed more con-
trol over link placement (i.e., as k is reduced), the accuracy
ﬁrst falls to no better than random, before dropping sig-
niﬁcantly below 0.5. This indicates that the Sybil defense
schemes are ranking Sybils signiﬁcantly higher than non-
Sybils, meaning the schemes are admitting Sybils and block-
ing non-Sybils. The reason for this is the strong community
structure present in the Facebook network combined with
the stronger attack model: as the Sybils target their links
more carefully, they appear as part of the trusted node’s
local community and are therefore more highly ranked.
5.3 Implications
In this section, we explored how the performance of Sybil
defense schemes is aﬀected by the structure of the social
network and by the ability of the attacker to exploit the
structure of the social network to launch targeted attacks.
Based on our understanding of how Sybil defense schemes
work, we hypothesized that networks with well-deﬁned com-
munity structure would be more vulnerable to Sybil attacks.
We veriﬁed our hypothesis by demonstrating that, as the
non-Sybil region contains more signiﬁcant community struc-
ture, the detection accuracy of all schemes falls signiﬁcantly
and the schemes are vulnerable to targeted Sybil attacks.
Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations of existing
Sybil defense schemes that arise out of their reliance on com-
munity structure in the network. Our list of limitations is
by no means exhaustive; other vulnerabilities of relying on
community detection exist. For example, a recent study has
shown that identifying communities reliably in a wide range
of real-world networks is a notoriously diﬃcult task [15].
We hope that, by pointing out these limitations, we moti-
