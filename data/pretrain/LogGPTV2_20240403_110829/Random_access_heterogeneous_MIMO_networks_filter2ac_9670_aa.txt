ABSTRACT
This paper presents the design and implementation of 802.11n+,
a fully distributed random access protocol for MIMO networks.
802.11n+ allows nodes that differ in the number of antennas to
contend not just for time, but also for the degrees of freedom pro-
vided by multiple antennas. We show that even when the medium
is already occupied by some nodes, nodes with more antennas
can transmit concurrently without harming the ongoing transmis-
sions. Furthermore, such nodes can contend for the medium in a
fully distributed way. Our testbed evaluation shows that even for a
small network with three competing node pairs, the resulting sys-
tem about doubles the average network throughput. It also main-
tains the random access nature of today’s 802.11n networks.

INTRODUCTION
Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) technology [6] is emerging
as the default choice for wireless networks. The wireless industry
is continuously pushing toward increasing the number of antennas
per device. While 3 × 3 MIMO nodes represented the state of the
art in 2009, 4 × 4 MIMO nodes were introduced on the market in
2010 [1]. Simultaneously, there is a proliferation of wireless de-
vices with diverse form factors. These range from large devices,
like desktops and laptops, to small devices, like temperature or light
sensors, and a whole range of devices in between like smartphones
and tablets. The physical size of these devices intrinsically limits
the maximum number of antennas that they can support, and their
differing capabilities and costs mean that they will naturally have
different MIMO processing power. The combination of these two
trends - a growth in the maximum number of antennas per device,
and an increase in device diversity - means that future wireless net-
works will be populated by heterogeneous APs and clients sup-
porting different numbers of antennas. For example, today a home

(a) 802.11n’s Current Behavior

user may have a 2- or 3-antenna AP but one of her neighbors may
have a single-antenna AP on the same channel. Even inside a single
house, users can connect their HD TV to their video server using
high-end 4 × 4 MIMO 802.11n devices [1], while continuing to use
their 2- or 3- antenna wireless AP for the remaining devices in the
home, while the home sensor network uses a single-antenna home
controller that communicates with the sensors and actuators.
The existing design of 802.11n however uses the blueprint of tra-
ditional single-antenna networks, and as a result cannot efﬁciently
support such heterogeneous MIMO networks. Consider for exam-
ple the scenario in Fig. 1(a) where a single-antenna pair is exchang-
ing a packet. A nearby 2 × 2 802.11n system will abstain from con-
currently transmitting because it senses the medium as occupied.
However, this is wasteful because a 2 × 2 MIMO pair can support
two concurrent transmissions, and hence should be able to transmit
a packet concurrently with the ongoing single-antenna transmis-
sion.
The objective of this paper is to develop a medium access proto-
col that enables as many concurrent transmissions as permitted by
the MIMO transmitter with the maximum number of antennas. We
would like for our design however to maintain the fully distributed
random access nature of today’s 802.11n. A distributed protocol
will enable MIMO LANs to continue to support bursty trafﬁc and
have independent different networks share the same medium with-
out explicit coordination.
We refer to our design as 802.11n+ or simply n+. It allows nodes
to contend not just for time, but also for the degrees of freedom (i.e.,
concurrent transmissions) enabled by multiple antennas. Speciﬁ-
cally, like 802.11, in n+, nodes who have trafﬁc contend for the
medium using carrier sense. Unlike 802.11, however, which stops
contending after a node wins the contention, in n+, nodes with
more antennas than the contention winner continue to carrier sense
and contend for the medium. Once a node wins this secondary con-
tention, it can transmit concurrently with the ongoing transmission.
The process continues until the number of used degrees of freedom
equals the maximum number of antennas on any MIMO transmitter
with trafﬁc demands.
To realize the above design, n+ has to address two main chal-
lenges:
(a) How do nodes carrier sense in the presence of ongoing
transmissions? n+ extends carrier sense to work in the presence
of ongoing transmissions. Speciﬁcally, since nodes with multiple
antennas receive the signal in a multi-dimensional space, they can
project on a space orthogonal to the ongoing transmission(s). This
orthogonal space does not contain any interference from the on-
going signal(s). Nodes can hence contend for concurrent transmis-
sions in this orthogonal space as if they were contending for an idle
medium. We name this technique multi-dimensional carrier sense.
(b) How can a node transmit without interfering with ongoing
transmissions? We use interference nulling [32] to zero out the
signal at the receivers of the ongoing transmissions. For example,
in the scenario in Fig. 1(b), the two-antenna transmitter, tx2, nulls
its signal at rx1 and hence does not interfere with the ongoing trans-
mission. Interference nulling on its own, however, does not allow
nodes to achieve all the degrees of freedom available in the system.
Speciﬁcally, consider a scenario where two transmitter-receiver
pairs are already occupying the medium. tx1-rx1 is a single-antenna
pair, while tx2-rx2 is a two-antenna MIMO system. Say that a 3-
antenna transmitter-receiver pair, tx3-rx3, wants to transmit con-
currently. Then tx3 will need to zero out its signal on three anten-
nas, the antenna on rx1 and the two antennas on rx2. Since nulling
requires a node to give up one of its antennas for every receive an-
tenna where it wants to null its signal [7], it consumes the three
antennas at tx3, leaving it no antenna to transmit to its own re-
ceiver. We will show in §2 that by using a combination of inter-
ference nulling and interference alignment, tx3 can indeed transmit
concurrently with tx1 and tx2 and use all the available degrees of
freedom, without interfering with the ongoing transmissions.
Our work is mostly related to recent empirical work on MIMO
systems including [7, 31, 13]. n+ is motivated by this work and
builds on it. Past systems however require concurrent transmissions
to be coordinated by a single node. Concurrent transmissions have
to be pre-coded together at a single transmitter (as in beamform-
ing [7]) or decoded together at a single receiver (as in SAM [31]),
or the transmitters or the receivers have to be controlled over the
Ethernet by a single master node (as in IAC [13]). In contrast, n+
is a fully distributed medium access protocol where nodes with any
number of antennas can transmit and receive concurrent packets
without a centralized coordinator.
We have built a prototype of n+ using the USRP2 radio plat-
form and evaluated it over a 10 MHz channel. Our implementation
uses an OFDM PHY-layer and supports the various modulations
(BPSK, 4-64 QAM) and coding options used in 802.11. It also ad-
dresses practical issues like multipath and frequency and time syn-
chronization.
Our evaluation considers three contending pairs of nodes that
differ in the number of antennas, and have a maximum of three
antennas at any node. We compare the throughput that these pairs
obtain in today’s 802.11n network with the throughput they obtain
with n+. Our ﬁndings are as follows:
• Though the maximum number of antennas in our testbed is rel-
atively small – 3 antennas – n+ nearly doubles the network
throughput.
• Nodes that have more antennas experience a higher throughput
gain with n+. In our experiments, the average throughput gain
of a 2×2 MIMO system is 1.5x and of a 3×3 MIMO system is
3.5x.
• In practice, interference nulling and alignment do not completely
eliminate interference. They leave a residual error of 0.8 dB for
nulling and 1.3 dB for alignment. This leads to a small average
throughput reduction of 3% for single-antenna nodes. We believe
this reduction is reasonable in comparison to the overall through-
put gain.
Contributions: The paper presents a primitive that enables MIMO
nodes to join ongoing transmissions without interfering with them.
It then builds on this primitive to deliver a random access protocol
where MIMO nodes contend for both time and degrees of freedom
using multi-dimensional carrier sense, without any form of central-
ized coordination. Finally, it implements its design and evaluates it
in a wireless testbed.

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES
Consider the network shown in Fig. 2, where tx1 wants to com-
municate with rx1, and tx2 wants to communicate with rx2. How
do we design a MAC protocol that allows this network to use all
available degrees of freedom?
Exploiting Interference Nulling: A key challenge we need to ad-
dress is: how does tx2 transmit without interfering with the ongoing
reception at rx1? To do this, we leverage a MIMO technique called
interference nulling, i.e., the signal transmitted by tx2 creates a null
at the antenna of rx1, as shown in Fig. 2. Say hij is the channel co-
efﬁcients from the ith antenna at the transmitters to the jth antenna
at the receivers. To create a null at rx1, for every symbol q trans-
mitted, tx2 transmits q on the ﬁrst antenna and αq on the second
antenna. The signals from tx2’s antennas combine on the medium,
and rx1 receives (h21 + αh31)q. By picking α to be − h21
, tx2 can
h31
ensure that the signals from its two antennas cancel each other at
rx1, and hence do not create any interference at rx1.
Note that this nulling at rx1 does not prevent tx2 from delivering
its packet to its own receiver rx2. In particular, say tx1 is trans-
mitting the symbol p and tx2 is transmitting the symbol q. Intu-
itively, since rx2 has two antennas, the received signal lives in a 2-
dimensional space. In this space, the two symbols p and q lie along
two different directions, as shown in the bottom graph in Fig. 2.
Thus, to decode its desired symbol, q, rx2 projects on a direction
orthogonal to p, which is interference-free from the symbol, p.
The above intuition can be formalized as follows: rx2 receives
the following signals on its two antennas:
y2 = h12p + (h22 + h32α)q
y3 = h13p + (h23 + h33α)q
(1a)
(1b)
Say rx2 knows the channel terms from tx1 and tx2 (which it can
compute from the preamble in their packets), it can solve the above
two equations for the two unknowns p and q, and obtain its desired
symbol, q.1
The above discussion assumes that tx2 knows the channel from
itself to rx1 so that it can compute the value of α. The naive way to
do this would have tx2 and rx1 coordinate and exchange channel in-
formation before tx1 starts transmitting. Such a solution, however,
requires tx1-rx1 to worry about which node pair may later join their
transmission and coordinate with that pair to prevent interference.
Fortunately, this is not necessary. To enable channel estimation in
a distributed way, n+ makes a communicating pair precede its data
exchange with a light-weight handshake, operationally similar to
1Note that rx2 does not need to know α because tx2 sends its
preamble while nulling at rx1, which means that rx2 computes the
effective channels (h22 + h32α) and (h23 + h33α) directly from tx2’s
preamble.

RTS-CTS but signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient (as described in §3.5).
A transmitter that wants to join the ongoing transmissions exploits
the handshake messages of prior contention winners to compute the
reverse channels from itself to receivers of ongoing transmissions,
using channel reciprocity. Reciprocity states that electromagnetic
waves travel forward and backward the same way, and hence the
channel observed between any two antennas should be the same re-
gardless of the direction [15]. Reciprocity has also been conﬁrmed
empirically in [4, 13, 14].2
Exploiting Interference Alignment: The above MAC protocol al-
lows the network to achieve two degrees of freedom at any point
in time, which is the maximum degrees of freedom available in this
network. The design we described so far, however, does not trivially
extend to more than two transmission pairs. To understand why, let
us add a third communicating pair, tx3-rx3, to the above network as
shown in Fig. 3. The new pair is a 3-antenna system and hence can
support three degrees of freedom. This means that tx3 should be
able to transmit an additional packet to rx3, concurrent to the two
transmissions of tx1-rx1 and tx2-rx2. The transmitter tx3, however,
is in a more challenging position, because it should interfere with
neither rx1 nor rx2. So how does tx3 achieve this goal?
Say that tx3 uses only interference nulling as in the previous
case. To ensure that it does not create any interference at rx1 and
rx2, tx3 needs to null its signal at three antennas, the antenna at
rx1 and the two antennas at rx2. Unfortunately, nulling at three an-
tennas will prevent tx3 from sending any data. To see why this is
the case, let tx3 transmit its packet r on its three antennas, after
multiplying it with α′, β′ and γ′, respectively. Let hij be the chan-
nel coefﬁcients between antennas i = 4, 5, 6 on tx3 and antennas
j = 1, 2, 3 on rx1 and rx2 where tx3 needs to perform nulling. The
signals from tx3’s antennas combine on the medium, creating a dif-
ferent equation at each receive antenna. Nulling the signal at rx1’s
antenna and rx2’s two antennas can be expressed as follows:
r(h41α′ + h51β′ + h61γ′) = 0
r(h42α′ + h52β′ + h62γ′) = 0
r(h43α′ + h53β′ + h63γ′) = 0,
(2a)
(2b)
(2c)
where r is tx3’s symbol and hij are the channel coefﬁcients.
The above three equations are satisﬁed for any value of the trans-
mitted symbol, r, if and only if (α′, β′, γ′) = (0, 0, 0). This solu-
tion, however, is clearly unacceptable because it will prevent tx3
2Applying reciprocity in a practical system requires taking into ac-
count the additional channel imposed by the hardware, which how-
ever is constant and hence can be computed ofﬂine [4, 14, 13]. Our
implementation uses the method used in [4] to calibrate the hard-
ware.
from transmitting any signal from any of its antennas to its receiver.
Therefore, interference nulling alone is not sufﬁcient to prevent tx3
from interfering with concurrent transmissions while delivering a
packet to its receiver.
We will show that a combination of interference nulling and in-
terference alignment achieves the goal. To eliminate interference
