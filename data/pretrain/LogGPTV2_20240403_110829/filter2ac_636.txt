**ATT&CK ID:** T1027.006  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** HTML Smuggling

Adversaries may use HTML smuggling to bypass content filters by concealing malicious payloads within seemingly harmless HTML files. This technique leverages several features of HTML and JavaScript to achieve its goals:

1. **JavaScript Blobs**: HTML documents can store large binary objects, known as JavaScript Blobs, which are immutable data structures that represent raw bytes. These blobs can be manipulated and converted into file-like objects, allowing the delivery of malicious content.

2. **Data URLs**: Data URLs enable the embedding of media types or MIME files directly within HTML documents. This allows adversaries to include binary data, such as executable files, in a format that appears to be part of the HTML content.

3. **HTML5 Download Attribute**: The `download` attribute, introduced in HTML5, can be used to trigger file downloads. By setting this attribute on an `<a>` tag, adversaries can initiate the download of a file that was previously hidden within the HTML document using Blobs or Data URLs.

By combining these techniques, adversaries can effectively smuggle malicious payloads past content filters, making it more difficult for security systems to detect and block the malicious activity.
