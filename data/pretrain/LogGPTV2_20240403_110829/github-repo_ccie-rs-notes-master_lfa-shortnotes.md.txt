# EIGRP
## Restrictions for EIGRP LFA FRR
* Only paths reachable through p2p ints protection
* v6 not supported
## Repair Paths Overview
* Forward traffic during routing convergence
* Initially only neighbouring devices aware of failure
* others dont know
* Device adjacent to failure should use repair paths until failure communicated
* Repair paths precomputed
## LFA Computation
* Pre-computed next hop route, without loop back
* LFA in network failure
* LFA forwards without knowing of failure
* LFA computed two different ways
 * Per link - All prefixes through one link sheare same back up, protects next hop address
 * Per prefix - Protects destination address
* EIGRP does prefix-based LFAs
## LFA Tie Breaking Rules
* **interface-disjoint** - No LFA over same path as existing egress int
* **linecard-disjoint** - As above, but same linecard 
* **lowest-repair-path-metric** - If metric high, eliminate
* **SRLG-disjoint** - Shared Risk Link Group, eliminates in same group (could be common fibre)
## Configure
**LFA FRRs per Prefix**
```
router eigrp DAVE
 address-family ipv4 autonomous-system 65001
  topology base
   fast-reroute per-prefix { all | route-map NAME}
```
* **show ip eigrp topology frr**
**Disabling Load sharing among prefixes**
* When primary path ECMP with multiple LFAs
 * Prefixes among LFAs
 * When selection of LFAs tie breaking, disable load sharing among prefixes
```
router eigrp DAVE
 address-family ipv4 autonomous-system 65001
  topology base
   fast-reroute load-sharing disable
```
**Enabling Tie Breaking for EIGRP LFAs**
* Can assign priorities, lower better
```
router eigrp DAVE
 address-family ipv4 autonomous-system 65001
  topology base
   fast-reroute tie-break { interface-disjoint | linecard-disjoint | lowest-backup-path-metric | srlg-disjoint } priority-number
```
# OSPF
## Restrictions for LFA FRR
* Not supported on VL headends
* Only in global VPN VRF
* TE cannot be protected int
* TE tunnel can be in repair path, but won't verify placement
* Not all routes have repair paths
## Info about LFA FRR
### LFA Repair Paths
* Protecting router precomputes per-prefix repair paths
* Installed in RIB
* When primary fails, live traffic over stored repair path
### LFA Repair Path Attributes
Default policy: -
1. srlg
2. primary-path
3. interface-disjoint
4. lowest-metric
5. linecard-disjoint
6. node-protecting
7. broadcast-interface-disjoint
* SRLG - Only for locally configured groups\
 * Repair paths must have different SRLG ID
* Int Prottection - P2Ps have no alternate next hop
 * Prevents selection, protecting int
* Broadcast Int Protection - If computed on same int, but next-hops different, link not protected
* Node Protection - Can bypass primary path gateway router
* Downstream Path - Can specify metric path msut be lower than
* Linecard disjoint
* Metric - Repair path with lwoest metric
* ECMP Primary Paths - Can config primary attribute to specify an LFA repair path from ECMP set, or secondary to those not in ECMP set
* Candidate Repair-Path Lists - Usually keeps in local RIB only best among all candidates, can specify to keep all (more memory)
## Config
**Per-Prefix LFA FRR**
```
router ospf 1
 fast-reroute per-prefix enable prefix-priority LEVEL
```
* Low priority - All prefixes same eligibility
* High priority - Only high priority protected
**Specify prefixes protected**
```
route-map TEST permit
 match tag 11
router ospf 1
 prefix-priority high route-map TEST
```
**Selection policy**
```
router ospf 1

# BGP
## PIC Edge
### Pre-Reqs
* BGP and IP/MPLS network up and running, site multihomed
* Backup/alternate has unique next hop
* BFD to detect link failures
### Restrictions
* For BGP Multipath, PIC already supported
* No BGP PIC for MPLS VPN Inter-AS Option B
* v4, v6, VPNv4 and VPNv6 NLRI
* If RR only in control plane, don't need BGP PIC (PIC is data plane)
* If two PEs are each others alternate path, traffic loops until TTL expires
* No support for NFS with SSO, ISSU is if Route Processors support it
* Solves traffic forwarding only for single network failure at edge and core
* Doesn't work with BGP Best External
### Benefits
* Additional paths for failover
* Constant convergence time
* From IOS XE 3.10S up, labelled PIC and LFA FRR can be togetehr on ASR 903
### Convergence improvements
**BGP Functionality**
* Second best path calc'd along with primary best
* Best and backup into BGP RIB
**RIB Functionality**
* Alternate per route installed if available
* With PIC, if RIB selects route with backup, installed backup with ebst path
**CEF Functionality**
* Stores alt path per prefix
* When primary lost, backup searched for in prefix independent manner
* CEF listens to BFD
**MPLS Functionality**
* Siumilar to CEF
* Stores alt path, switches if primary disappears
* When PIC enabled, backup in RIB, IP RIB and FIB
* Two type of failure
 * Core node/link failure (iBGP) - Failure detected through IGP convergence, detected through RIB to FIB
 * Local link/immediate node (eBGP) - BFD required, CEF looks for BFD events
**Convergence in Data Plane**
* CEF detects alt next hop for all prefixes affected by failure
* Data plane convergence subsecond
**Convergence in Control Plane**
* Learns through IGP/BFD, withdraws prefixes
* Calcs best and backups, advertises next best
### BGP FRRs role in BGP PIC
* FRR provides best and backup in BGP RIB and CEF
* Second best programemd into RIB and CEF, CEF programs linecard
* BGP PIC means CEF can switch to other egress ports if current next hop goes down
![BGP PIC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stuh84/ccie-rs-notes/master/images/pic.png)
### Convergence
* Happens in subseconds or seconds, dependent on if PIC enabled in line card
* For platforms with CEF in line card, subsecond
* For platforms with CEF in software, convergence in seconds
### Improving MPLS VPN BGP local convergence
* Maintains local label for 5 minutes, ensures traffic uses backup/alternate
* Improves LoC time to under a second
* When link failure, traffic over backup
* Overrides MPLS VPN-BGP local convergence (**protection local-prefixes**)
### Config Modes
* VPNv4 AF mode protects all VRFs
* VRF-IPv4 protects only v4 vrfs
* Router config mode protects global table
### CEF Forwarding Recursion
* Ability to find next matching path when primary goes
* Need to disable when using PIC as it searches all FIB entries
* BGP PIC Edge already computed backup
* Recursion disabled under two conditions if PIC edge enabled
 * For next hops with /32 mask
 * Next hops directly connected
* **bgp recursion host** - Disables/enables CEF recursion for BGP host routes
 * By default, enabled on vpnv4/v6, disabled on v4/v6 when PIC enabled
* Disabled for directly connected next hops with **disable-connected-check**
### Configuration
```
router bgp
 address-family ipv4/vpnv4/ipv4 vrf
  bgp additional-paths install
  bgp recursion host
  neighbor x.x.x.x fall-ver bfd
```
* Disable PIC core - **cef table output-chain build favor memory-utlization**
## BGP Add Paths
### Benefits
* Adv multiple paths for same prefix
### Functionality
* Adds path ID for each path in NLRI
* Similar to RD, except any AF
* ID unique to peering session
* generated per nettwork
* Stops overriding announcements
Following steps
1. Specify if device can send/rx or both, for Add Paths in AF or neighbour (capability negotiation)
2. Select candidate paths for advertisement
3. Adverise for a neighbour
* Those negotiated capability grouped in a different update group from those that dont
**Additional Path Slection**
* **set path-selection all advertise** advertises all paths
### Guidelines and limitations
* Not dynamic capability
* Valid on next reset of neighbour
* No tearing down of sessions
### Configure add paths
```
router bgp 65000
 address-family ipv4/ipv6 unicast
  additional-paths receive
  additional-paths send
  additional-paths selection route-map NAME
```
### Configure BGP Add Paths per neighbour
```
router bgp 65000
 neighbor x.x.x.x remote-as 65001
  address-family ipv4/ipv6 unicast
   capability additional-paths receive [disable]
   capability additional-paths send [disable]
```
* Above overrides whats at AF level
### Peer Policy
```
router bgp 65000
 template peer-policy NAME
  capability additional-paths receive
  capability additional-paths send
 neighbor x.x.x.x remote-as 65001
  address-family ipv4 unicast
   inherit peer-policy NAME sequence-number
```
### Filtering and setting actions for add paths
* Route map to filter paths
* Match on prefix of additional paths that are candidates
```
route -map NAME deny/permit
 set path-selection all advertise
 set metric
```
## BGP NHT
* Next-Hop address tracking enabled by default when IOS supports it
* Event driven
* Prefixes auto tracked when peers establish
* Next-hop changes picked up by BGP quickly (when RIB updates)
* When best path calc run in between scanner cycles, only next-hop changes tracked and processed
### Default BGP Scanner Behaviour
* Monitors next hop for reachability
* Polls RIB every 60s
### Selective BGP Next-hop Route Filtering
* Implemented as part of selectic tracking feature
* Supports NH tracking
* Route map defines routes to resolve BGP next hop
* **bgp nexthop** - allows config length of prefix that applies NH attribute
* Route map during bestpath calc, applied to route in routing table that covers next-hop attribute for prefixes
* If next-hop route fails route-map, marked as unreachable
* **match ip address** and **match source-protocol** in route map
### BGP Support for Fast Peering Session Deactivation
**Fast Peering Deactivation**
* Event driven
* Per neighbour basis
* monitors session to neighbour
* Adj changes detected
* Terminates peering session in between default or config'd BGP scanning interval
**Selective Address Tracking for BGP fast session deactivation**
* Route map
* **neighbor fall-over** command, determines if peering session reset when route to peer changes
* Route map evaluates new route
* If deny return, session reset
### Configuration
* Make sure IGP convergence is quick, otherwise BGP reacts while still converging
**Selective Next-Hop Route Filtering**
```
router bgp 65000
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  bgp nexthop route-map CHECK-NEXTHOP
ip prefix-list FILTER seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 25
route-map CHECK-NEXTHOP deny 10 
 match ip address prefix-list FILTER
route-map CHECK-NEXTHOP permit 20
```
**Adjust delay interval for Next hop tracking**
* Tune delay between full table walks to match IGP parameters
* Default 5s
```
router bgp 65000
 address-family FAMILY
  bgp nexthop trigger delay TIMER - Max 100s
```
**Disabling next hop address tracking**
* Enabled by default on v4 and vpnv4
* Since IOS 12.2(33), by default under VPNv6 when next hop is v4 address mapped to v6 next ho paddress
```
router bgp 65000
 address family FAMILY
  no bgp nexthop trigger enable
```
### Configuring Fast Session Decativation
**Per Neighbour**
```
router bgp 65000
 address-family FAMILY
  neighbor X.X.X.X remote-as 65001
  neighbor X.X.X.X fall-over
```
**Selective**
```
router bgp 65000
 neighbor X.X.X.X remote-as 65001
 neighbor X.X.X.X fall-over [route-map NAME]
ip prefix-list FILTER seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0 ge 28
route-map CHECK-NEXTHOP deny 10
 match ip address prefix-list FILTER
route-map CHECK-NEXTHOP permit 20
```
