**Describe the problem**  
I am unable to build a static version of tensorflow as described for a
solution to:
#22810 (comment)
**Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before
running into the problem**
Trying to use tensorflow/contrib/cmake results in a number of errors
**Any other info / logs**  
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and
files should be attached.
Can you describe the approach to creating a static version of the libraries
needed for the following headers:
#include   
#include   
#include 
To link against my software?
Or alternatively solve this issue:
#22810
Dated in October of last year.
Static linking seems to be doable.
