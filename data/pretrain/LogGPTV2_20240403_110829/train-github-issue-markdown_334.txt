I recently moved to webpack from require.js and some node_module have .min
files built in. When I use a file from node_module I just do `require('my-
module')` and it loads it right away without any config. But this will load
the development version or a bigger version.
For example react is loaded `require('react/addons')` but this is not the
minified version.
My question is:
  * Should I load modules normally and then minify everything?
  * Should I use their .min files provided and then minify everything again? (in this way I save a lot of disk)
  * Any better way? Would be nice to automatically loade minified files.
For now, I'm changing the aliases of webpack to load the minified version when
building the app:
    myConfig.resolve.alias.phaserUnFixed = "nodeModules/phaser/build/custom/phaser-no-physics.min.js";
    myConfig.resolve.alias.react = "nodeModules/react/dist/react-with-addons.min.js";
    myConfig.resolve.alias.lodash = "nodeModules/lodash/dist/lodash.compat.min.js";
    myConfig.resolve.alias.moment = "nodeModules/moment/min/moment.min.js";
But this is not a good approach either... Can you think of anything better?
