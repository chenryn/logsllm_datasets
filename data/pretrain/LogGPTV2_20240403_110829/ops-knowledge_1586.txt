User: Microservice architecture is a popular software architecture in recent years. Please design an e-commerce platform with microservice architecture, including service splitting, service registration and discovery, and service invocation.
Assistant: The micro-service architecture design of the e-commerce platform is as follows: Service splitting: 1. User service: Responsible for user registration, login, user information query, user information modification and other operations. 2. Commodity service: Responsible for operations such as adding, querying, modifying, deleting, and managing commodity categories. 3. Order service: Responsible for order generation, query, cancellation, payment and other operations. 4. Message service: Responsible for sending message notifications, including text messages, emails, station messages, etc. 5. Evaluation service: Responsible for product evaluation, query evaluation information and other operations. 6. Search service: Responsible for operations such as product search and sorting. 7. Shopping cart service: responsible for adding products to the shopping cart, viewing shopping cart products, modifying shopping cart products and other operations. Service registration and discovery: 1. Register each service in the service registration center. 2. Using Zookeeper as the service registration center, each service needs to register a service instance with Zookeeper and maintain the registration information. 3. Realize the automatic discovery of services through Zookeeper monitoring. Service call: 1. The front end accesses the microservice through API Gateway. 2. The exposed API gateway is responsible for load balancing and forwarding requests to specific microservices. 3. The asynchronous message queue makes calls between microservices to reduce coupling. 4. The services are called through the HTTP interface and communicate in JSON format. The above are the main schemes for the microservice architecture design of the e-commerce platform, which can be adjusted and optimized according to specific business needs.
