## Abstract

DNS amplification attacks have been employed in over 34% of high-volume DDoS attacks, with some floods exceeding 300 Gbps. Current best practices are primarily preventative and rely on third-party organizations, which often lack incentives to follow the recommendations. These measures do not address the threat posed by authoritative DNS servers. This study measures and characterizes the attack potential associated with DNS amplification and proposes a mitigation strategy that can be implemented by organizations with the assistance of an upstream ISP. Our approach allows even poorly provisioned organizations to mitigate massive DNS amplification attacks with minimal performance overhead.

## 1. Introduction

In 2013 and early 2014, DNS amplification was used in 34.9% of high-volume DDoS attacks (those generating at least 20 Gbps of attack traffic) and 18.6% of all network DDoS attacks [8]. In March 2013, a high-profile attack against Spamhaus utilized DNS amplification, with traffic volumes exceeding 300 Gbps [1]. DNS amplification attacks are particularly effective for several reasons:
1. The amplification effect allows attackers to generate a disproportionate amount of traffic at the victim.
2. IP address spoofing and reflection conceal the identities of the attacking systems, preventing them from being blacklisted or cleaned.
3. Victims cannot blacklist the IP addresses of reflecting DNS servers without also hindering legitimate DNS resolutions.

In a typical DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends a forged DNS query packet from an attack system to a DNS server, setting the source IP address to the victim's IP. The DNS server processes the query and sends a response back to the victim, consuming the victim's bandwidth and computational resources. The response packet is larger than the query, increasing the attack traffic by an amplification factor.

While DNS amplification attacks are well understood, the best defensive strategies are less clear. US-CERT recommends reducing the number of open DNS resolvers, disabling public recursion on authoritative DNS servers, rate limiting responses, and limiting IP address spoofing [16]. However, these actions primarily benefit other organizations, not the one implementing them. Additionally, over 25% of Autonomous Systems still allow arbitrary IP spoofing [2].

These recommendations, while well-intentioned, may not have the desired impact. Efforts to reduce open DNS resolvers do not solve the problem, as attackers can directly query authoritative servers to create effective DDoS conditions.

In this work, we make the following contributions:
1. **Measure and Characterize Attack Potential:** We perform DNS queries to authoritative servers for 129 million domains in 9 top-level domains (TLDs) to determine the amplification factor for four types of queries. We found that we could create an attack of 1,444 MBytes/s at the target by sending only 44 MBytes/s of attack traffic at the application layer.
2. **Measure the Adoption of Query Rate-Limiting:** We randomly sampled 0.5% of the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers and issued repeated queries to determine if they employed rate limiting. We found that 2.69% of the studied domains used rate limiting, with 7.38% limiting at 5 queries per second or less, and the remaining 92.62% using a rate limit between 9 and 14 queries per second.
3. **Propose and Evaluate a Novel Mitigation Method:** We propose a straightforward mitigation approach involving remote hosting for authoritative DNS servers and upstream filtering of all DNS traffic. To preserve DNS functionality, we propose tunneling DNS queries to a remote resolver, such as a cloud provider or ISP. We found that this method can be activated in less than 0.67 seconds, with a median additional latency of 16 ms, allowing organizations to withstand high-volume DNS amplification attacks with minimal effort.

## 2. Background and Related Work

Traditional reflection attacks, such as the Smurf attack [15], involve forging the source IP address of a packet to be the address of the intended victim. The attacker sends the packet to an innocent third-party system (reflector), which issues a legitimate reply to the victim. When a large number of packets are sent to reflectors, the combined volume at the victim can be overwhelming.

Paxson [11] described how reflectors can be used in distributed reflector denial of service (DRDoS) attacks and proposed five possible defenses:
1. Filter reflected attack traffic at the victim.
2. Prevent source address spoofing.
3. Detect and block spoofed packets at the reflector.
4. Allow traceback to the origin through the reflector.
5. Detect attack traffic from compromised systems.

Except for the first defense, each requires third-party organizations to detect and block attack traffic, which is unlikely to succeed due to a lack of incentives. For example, over 25% of Autonomous Systems still allow arbitrary IP spoofing [2].

Amplification attacks, such as NTP amplification [12,17], leverage protocol-specific attributes to increase the attack volume. Rossow [13] examined 14 different network protocols for reflection attacks, including DNS, but the analysis was not as comprehensive as our own. Kührer et al. [10] discussed the prevalence of DNS amplifiers and fingerprinting techniques but did not expand on the amplification results.

US-CERT recommends eliminating open DNS resolvers [16], echoing RFC 5358 [5]. However, this advice ignores the hundreds of thousands of authoritative DNS servers that must answer queries. These servers are well-provisioned and capable of handling large volumes of traffic [7]. Attackers can use these servers to launch crippling attacks, even without open resolvers. Therefore, we focus on the risks associated with authoritative servers.

## 3. DNS Amplification Potential

We begin by determining the inherent DNS amplification risks associated with today’s authoritative DNS servers. We examined over 129 million domains and over 1.1 million unique DNS authoritative servers to determine the amplification factor associated with common DNS queries.

### 3.1 Data Collection

We used a DNS zone snapshot from July 2, 2013, for nine generic top-level domains (gTLDs): biz, com, info, mobi, name, net, org, travel, and us. We obtained the DNS zone files from their respective maintainers, listing domain names and associated name servers. We collected records for 129,300,870 unique domains, with 2,771,768 unique host names listed as name servers, resolving to 1,101,446 unique name server IP addresses. We collected these records in a distributed fashion, using delays between queries to minimize impact.

Using these zone files, we constructed pairs of (domain name, NS IP address), resulting in 363,263,970 unique pairs. For each pair, we issued DNS queries to the associated name server for the domain name without indicating any subdomains or hosts (e.g., a query for example.com). Based on prior work [9], we focused on A records, ANY queries, and other common record types. Traditional DNS packets are limited to 512 bytes, but EDNS [6] allows larger packets if supported by both the resolver and authoritative server. Including an OPT record in the query can decrease the amplification factor if the server does not support EDNS.
