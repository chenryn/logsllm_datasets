## Environment & Settings
**Celery version** : 4.4.7, 5.0.5, master
**`celery report` Output:**
# Steps to Reproduce
  1. Run celery with default pool
  2. Add `autoretry_for` or `raise Retry(exc=ValueError())`
  3. Intercept `task-retried` event (i.e. for RabbitMQ it's published to `celeryev` exchange with routing key `task.retried`
  4. Expecting "exception" argument to be not empty, getting "None" in it.

## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
    x = Retry('foo', KeyError(), when=datetime.utcnow())
    y = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(x))
    assert repr(x) == repr(y)
# Expected Behavior
Retry instance after pickle/unpickle is the same as initial one
# Actual Behavior
After unpicklig Retry looses `self.exc`
