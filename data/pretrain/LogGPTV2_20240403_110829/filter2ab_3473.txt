title:blackhat:eu-19 Practical Side-Channel Attacks Against WPA-TKIP
Wireless networks and their security protocols keep evolving due to increased performance and reliability demands. For instance, recently the Wi-Fi Alliance released WPA3, which offers better security guarantees (e.g., longer keys). In light of this, one would assume that legacy protocols such as WPA-TKIP are no longer widely used in modern Wi-Fi networks. Unfortunately, our wardriving efforts revealed that 44.81% of encrypted Wi-Fi networks still support and use WPA-TKIP. These wardrives spanned cities in the United States, Germany, and Belgium, and high usage of WPA-TKIP was observed in all of them. Motivated by this, we systematically analyzed the security of WPA-TKIP implementations.
