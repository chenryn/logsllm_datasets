not by checking the following equality.

4 Security Flaws in Zhang et al’s Scheme
The scheme in [1] has claimed that it provides receiver’s anonymity, and the
ciphertext does not disclose the identity of the receiver. The scheme has also
argued that if any receiver succeeds in decryption of a message, s/he will not
be able to identify who else can decrypt the same ciphertext. We show that the
scheme [1] does not provide receiver’s anonymity. In particular, the parameters
used in the matching phase allow the user to deduce the target receiver’s infor-
mation.
We assume that any user inside or outside the system has knowledge of all
attributes used in the system. The adversary or any legitimate user can suc-
cessfully check if a particular attribute is included in ciphertext. The at-
tributes which allow the attacker to make the attack successful are ˆC0 and
{{Ci,j,∆}1≤j≤ni}1≤i≤n. To check whether an attribute vi,j is included in cipher-
∆,i,j = H(i(cid:107)vi,j). Next the adversary checks if
text the adversary calculates D(cid:48)
equation 1 holds for an attribute vi,j.
e( ˆC0, D(cid:48)
∆,i,j) = e(Ci,j,∆, g1)
(1)
If the above equality holds true then the adversary can conclude that the at-
tribute used in the equation is included in ciphertext access policy. With this
information the adversary now checks if a speciﬁc attribute, which may be an
identity of a user (or linked to a user), is integrated in the access policy. If so,
the adversary can ﬁgure out who is the target receiver of the ciphertext.
For example, suppose that a University has three diﬀerent departments Com-
puter Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The at-
tribute categories and their corresponding value sets are as follows.
- For the attribute Role, WRole = {Dean, Teacher, Student, Administrative
Staﬀ}.
6
- For the attribute Department, WDept = {CS, EL, ME}.
- For the attribute Course, WCourse ={PhD, MS, BS}.
Assume that Dean wants to send a conﬁdential notice to all teachers in an
encrypted form using the scheme [1], then the Dean generates an encrypted
message. For simplicity we are not showing all ciphertext components, instead,
we provide the ciphertext components for the attribute Role.

C∆ =e(g, g)sY s(cid:48)
C0 = gs
ˆC0 = gs(cid:48)
˜C = MYs
C1 = gs(cid:48)(cid:48)
ˆC1 = gs−s(cid:48)(cid:48)
{CRole,T eacher,∆, CRole,T eacher,0, ˆCRole,T eacher,0} =
{H(Role(cid:107)T eacher)s(cid:48), H(0(cid:107)Role(cid:107)T eacher)s(cid:48)(cid:48),
H(1(cid:107)Role(cid:107)T eacher)s−s(cid:48)(cid:48) }
2
1
For other attributes such as Student, Dean and Administrative staﬀ random
values are provided.
The adversary now checks whether a Teacher is the intended recipient of the
ciphertext by following equation.
e( ˆC0, H(Role(cid:107)T eacher)) = e(CRole,T eacher,∆, g1).
The correctness of the equation is given below.
e( ˆC0, H(Role(cid:107)T eacher))
1 , H(Role(cid:107)T eacher))
= e(gs(cid:48)
= e(H(Role(cid:107)T eacher)s(cid:48), g1)
= e(CRole,T eacher,∆, g1)
We note that to recover the whole access policy the adversary requires ni × n
bilinear pairing operations. Let m = max(ni)1≤i≤n. Therefore, to disclose
the receiver’s identity the adversary requires at most O(mn) bilinear pairing
operations.
5 Conclusion
We have shown that Zhang et al ’s scheme lacks receiver’s anonymity. With
the set of all attributes anyone can successfully check whether an attribute is
required to decrypt the ciphertext in the matching phase, in turn, can reveal
the receivers’ identity from the attribute(s) used in the matching phase.
