I upgraded MUI from v0.16.7 to v0.19.3 and have now the following problem with
my popovers.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Popover should rendered at the position the placement logic calculates.
## Current Behavior
Popover renders at position 0/0 and after a short amount jumps to correct
position.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I made a video of the DatePicker docs which uses a Popover if inlined:
