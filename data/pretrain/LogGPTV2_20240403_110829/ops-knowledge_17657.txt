I understand you are looking to integrate OpenStack Liberty (using DevStack) with OpenDaylight Beryllium. Despite your extensive online research, you have not found sufficient or clear documentation for this specific integration. 

One recommended approach is to explore the OPNFV (Open Platform for Network Functions Virtualization) project. OPNFV provides an integrated platform that combines OpenStack and OpenDaylight as the SDN controller. This might offer more detailed and practical guidance for your integration needs. Additionally, you may want to check the following resources:

1. **OPNFV Documentation:** Look for guides and tutorials on the official OPNFV website.
2. **Community Forums:** Engage with the community through forums such as Stack Overflow, the OpenStack mailing list, or the OpenDaylight mailing list.
3. **GitHub Repositories:** Explore GitHub repositories related to both OpenStack and OpenDaylight. You might find example configurations or scripts that can help you.
