customers peak during a short period of time (e.g., start of
the day). In this case, the credit card number is checked
locally to make sure it is in valid format before storing the
request information for batching. Note that these transactions
are guaranteed by the banks issuing the credit cards as fraud
of this magnitude represents an extremely small loss even in
the aggregate.
Transactions involving larger amounts can also be batched
at the transferral step. In particular, these transactions are
typically sent to the bank to ensure that the necessary funds are
available, but transferral of funds between accounts often takes
place at some later time. Such transactions are typically run
against the bank’s fraud detection algorithms. These systems
use a number of characteristics of the sale (e.g., price, distance
from card holder’s home, time of day) to “score” the likelihood
of fraud. Should this score exceed some threshold, the bank
prevents the transaction from occurring. Disputed or fraudulent

A very simple mechanism to address this problem would
simply allow a credit card company to ask a cellular provider
for a user’s current location. However, a user’s location infor-
mation is potentially sensitive. Such a solution may allow an
adversary within a bank to maliciously track a user. Moreover,
as demonstrated in the Remsburg vs. DocuSearch case [1],
it may make a provider liable for the improper release of
information to third parties and is therefore unlikely to be
widely implemented. A successful solution in this space must
therefore make the user the ultimate arbiter of their location
information.
B. Design Goals
We used the above considerations to create a series of design
goals. First, no additional device should be required by the
accountholder. The added burden on the consumer tends to
decrease the usability of the solution, forcing consumers to
disable or abandon the security feature completely. Second, a
receiving party should have the ability to verify the identity
of the sender - there must be an end-to-end authentication
mechanism to conﬁrm the identity of the participants. This
goal addresses possible forged attempts by adversaries. Once
the communication channel is established, conﬁdentiality of
the contents exchanged should be enforced. This requirement
is especially important, given the potential for insider attacks
in such networks [34]. Fourth, an accountholder detecting a
fraudulent transaction must have the ability to prevent such a
transaction from proceeding.
Our ﬁfth goal
is scalability. The layered design of the
Internet allows application designers to create programs with-
out having a deep understanding of the networks over which
their data will traverse. Cellular networks, however, are built
with a different set of assumptions and are much more easily
overloaded for reasons other than bandwidth constraints [46].
Accordingly, communications in our system will not be sent
for every transaction as is proposed by other related proto-
cols [53]. Instead, we reduce the stress on the network by
communicating only in the rare case that fraud is suspected.
Sixth, we must be sure that our protocol fails in an acceptable
fashion. If a client does not respond to a query, a transaction
should fail. Finally, we attempt to make as few changes as
possible so that our solution can be easily implemented. In

transactions can easily be recovered from in such a system
as money often takes two days to be transferred between
accounts - however,
loss from transactions in which cash
is withdrawn is exceedingly difﬁcult to recover. Lowering
the detection threshold would allow banks to prevent more
potentially fraudlent exchanges from occurring; however, such
a change has traditionally been viewed as too expensive
given the need to hire more people to address false positives.
FrauVent seeks to circumvent such expense by having the user
themselves intervene in the rare instances when a transaction
is questionable or receives a borderline score.
B. GSM Localization
Knowledge of the merchant’s and the consumer’s location
information during the authorization process can signiﬁcantly
enhance the decision made by the user and the authorizing
bank. Such information allows a user to detect transactions
that might have previously gone unnoticed. Veriﬁed location
information of the consumer can offer assurance to the bank,
removing false positives while allowing fraud detection algo-
rithms to be more aggressive in what they classify as fraud.
The mechanisms to discover the location of the consumer on-
demand can be accomplished using the existing technology
available in cellular networks.
There are several methods of location discovery in the GSM
network as depicted in Table I. The most accurate method of
localization has been standardized by 3GPP [2] to be used
for E911 and other location based services. Uplink Time
Difference Of Arrival (U-TDOA) uses multilateration, also
known as hyperbolic positioning, to approximate the position
within 50 meters of the actual device. This method, as depicted
in Figure 2, measures the time difference of a cell signal
reaching multiple Location Measurement Units (LMU) via
multiple base stations. Although U-TDOA does not require
modiﬁcations to phones, it can be used in conjunction with
Assisted-GPS (A-GPS) or Angle Of Arrival (AOA) to improve
the accuracy up to 20 meters from the actual location.
Even though this technology has been available to the
telecommunication industry for the last several years, it has not
yet been available for a third-party location reporting service
due to the tremendous liability that the provider incurs in
distributing private information. However, current services of-
fered by major providers (e.g., turn-by-turn navigation) already
take advantage of this infrastructure. We propose that FrauVent
similarly avail itself of ﬁrst-person query functionality as part

approach in the following section.
V. FRAUVENT ARCHITECTURE
Given the background information on the supporting in-
frastructure, we now present the details of the two protocols
used by FrauVent. In the reactive protocol, users receive a
modiﬁed text message when suspicious transactions occur. The
proactive protocol allows a user suspecting that a transaction
may be ﬂagged (e.g., when traveling across the country) to log
in and approve each request. We discuss how both protocols
overcome the pitfalls of related work using similar techniques
and then use tools to provide formal guarantees about the
security of our constructions.
A. Protocol Deﬁnitions
1) Reactive Protocol: Our protocol uses location informa-
tion to provide users with improved context for decision mak-
ing. Whereas previously proposed systems simply transmitted
a text message saying that a transaction has occurred, we will
help the user correlate their current location with the location
of the transaction in question. However, conveying location
to a user can be surprisingly difﬁcult. While GPS informa-
tion is accurate to within 50 feet for civilian devices, the
coordinates themselves have little semantic value to a human
being. The use of city names, while seemingly straightforward,
may also provide signiﬁcant confusion as many such areas
are ambiguously deﬁned to unfamiliar users (e.g., hotels in
the vicinity of the NSF may be in the cities of Arlington
or Alexandria and the line between the two is not always
clear). We address this issue by leveraging the GPS and map
interfaces in many recently released smart phones. These tools
make location more intuitive and improve the chances that a
user will correctly determine whether fraud has occurred.
Figure 3 offers a high level overview of the reactive phase
of our proposed protocol. Like all standard point-of-sale
transactions, our system is activated by the user swiping their
credit card at a vendor. The vendor transmits a request to
the bank to conﬁrm that the client’s transaction is approved.
If the bank ﬂags the transaction as anomalous, the purchase
is traditionally denied. In the presence of our protocol, the

Fig. 3. High-level overview of the reactive location conﬁrmation protocol:
When a credit card is swiped, the vendor sends the credentials to the bank
as normal. If the bank suspects fraud, it transmits a location request for the
cellular phone corresponding to the client. Using a shared secret, the client is
able to conﬁrm or deny the use of the card. The bank then sends or denies
permission for the vendor to complete the transaction.
bank attempts an additional conﬁrmation from the user. Using
the mobile number the client has registered, the bank sends
a location veriﬁcation request through the mobile device’s
cellular provider. Note that this request contains the location,
vendor and amount of the transaction, all encrypted with
a key shared between the bank and the user. The provider
responds by locating the device and approximates its GPS
coordinates through a technique such as multilateration [40].
These coordinates are then signed using the network’s private
key and forwarded to the client, which then independently
determines its current location via GPS. This allows a client to
prevent an insider from forging their location. An application
on the client device then uses all of the above supplied location
information to render a map showing both the details of the
transaction and the relative proximity of the user to it. If the
user conﬁrms that the transaction occurred, they respond by
sending an encrypted copy of all of the location information
and a conﬁrmation of the transaction to the bank. If the client
conﬁrms the transaction, the bank allows it to proceed. A
negative or non-existent response forces the bank to revert
to its default response and reject the transaction. The protocol
is deﬁned formally in Figure 5.
This protocol overcomes the authentication issues that limit
the effectiveness of previous protocols. Our mechanisms also
make the user the arbiter of their location information and do
not introduce any new means for a network operator to reveal
a client’s location. Instead of having the network automatically
respond to the location veriﬁcation request and potentially leak
private information, only the user can correctly encrypt the
returning packets.
2) Proactive Protocol: While the protocol described in
the previous section addresses the authentication and privacy
issues in current text messaging-based protocols, it fails to
address real-time constraints. Even though our protocol only
transmits a text message at the suspicion of fraud (and not
after every transaction as previously suggested), the store-
and-forward nature of text messaging means that there are
no guarantees that such trafﬁc will be delivered in a timely
manner [43]. We therefore develop a protocol that attempts
Fig. 4. High-level overview of the proactive location conﬁrmation protocol:
In this scenario, the user runs an application when they believe that their
transaction is likely to be rejected and conﬁrms their location proactively.
to operate before the reactive mechanism is initiated. A user
having experienced a denied legitimate transaction can execute
this protocol to ensure success.
Figure 4 offers a high level overview of the proactive
protocol. When a user goes to make a transaction they feel
is likely to be denied as potentially fraudulent (e.g., very high
transaction value, location deviates from normal geographic
range), they activate an application on their mobile device.
Through this application, the user logs in to a transaction
monitor on the bank’s server, which updates the user when the
transaction is received. Like our proposed reactive mechanism,
the application in the proactive protocol presents the client
with a map and compares the location of the purchase against
the client’s current position. The client either approves or de-
nies the transaction via a data connection (e.g., GPRS/UMTS,
802.11x), and the bank then propagates this decision back to
the vendor. Note that this phase can be used as a ﬁrst option.
The system can default to the reactive phase if a client does
not remember to log in via the proactive application. Figure 6
provides a more formal deﬁnition of this protocol.
This approach is more scalable for a number of reasons.
First, unlike the asynchronous service model of SMS, the
user is able to initiate the protocol and exchange packets
directly with the bank’s server. This means that the multi-
second delay associated with the store-and-forward behavior
of text messaging is removed. Second, because locating a user
is among the most expensive and time consuming operations
in a cellular network [46], this approach signiﬁcantly reduces
the effort required by the infrastructure.
B. Formal Veriﬁcation
Having deﬁned the protocols making up FrauVent, we next
ensure that they provably provide the necessary guarantees.
To accomplish this goal, we used a tool called ProVerif [5].
ProVerif is an automated cryptographic protocol veriﬁer that
