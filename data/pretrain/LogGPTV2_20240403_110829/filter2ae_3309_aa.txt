# 前言
接上篇，General-skills部分主要是一些linux命令的使用和小tricks。部分题目文件已打包为附件。
# General Warmup 1 2 3
## Question
> If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?
>
> Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?
>
> What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10).
# Solution
三题签到题，差不多一个意思，就放一起了。
    >>> chr(0x41)
    'A'
    >>> bin(27)[2:]
    '11011'
    >>> 0x3d
    61
flag:
  * `picoCTF{A}`
  * `picoCTF{11011}`
  * `picoCTF{61}`

# Grep 1
## Question
> Can you find the flag in
> [file](https://2018shell2.picoctf.com/static/7216e49d925b623c5d2cf9d141a6e180/file)?
> This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find
> a faster way. You can also find the file in
> /problems/grep-1_3_8d9cff3d178c231ab735dfef3267a1c2 on the shell server.
### Hint
> grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)
## Solution
`grep`，(global search regular expression(RE) and print out the
line,全面搜索正则表达式并把行打印出来)是一种强大的文本搜索工具，它能使用正则表达式搜索文本，并把匹配的行打印出来。
`cat file`会有一大堆乱码字符，使用`grep picoCTF file`可以把flag从乱码中提取出来。
    finn@pico-2018-shell-2:/problems/grep-1_2_ee2b29d2f2b29c65db957609a3543418$ grep picoCTF file              
    picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_42783683}
# net cat
## Question
> Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you
> connect to `2018shell1.picoctf.com` at port `49387` to get the flag?
### Hint
nc [tutorial](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc)
## Solution
`nc`是一个简单、可靠的网络工具，可通过TCP或UDP协议传输读写数据。
通过nc连接题目的服务器得到flag。
    ❯ nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 36356
    That wasn't so hard was it?
    picoCTF{NEtcat_iS_a_NEcESSiTy_9454f3e0}
flag:`picoCTF{NEtcat_iS_a_NEcESSiTy_9454f3e0}`
# pipe
## Question
> During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need
> to process data that you receive over the network rather than through a
> file. Can you find a way to save the output from this program and search for
> the flag? Connect with `2018shell1.picoctf.com 48696`.
### Hint
> Remember the flag format is picoCTF{XXXX}
>
> Ever heard of a pipe? No not that kind of pipe... This
> [kind](http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html)
## Solution
**管道命令** 操作符是：`|`,它能处理经由前面一个指令传出的正确输出信息，也就是 standard output 的信息，然后作为标准的输入
standard input，传递给下一个命令。
连接服务器，配合`grep`得到flag。
    ❯ nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 34532 |grep picoCTF
    picoCTF{almost_like_mario_b797f2b3}
flag:`picoCTF{almost_like_mario_b797f2b3}`
# Strings
## Question
> Can you find the flag in this
> [file](https://2018shell2.picoctf.com/static/a3d311b507256d5d9299c0e94dfc4fc5/strings)
> without actually running it? You can also find the file in
> /problems/strings_2_b7404a3aee308619cb2ba79677989960 on the shell server.
### Hint
> [strings](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings)
## Solution
`strings`命令可以打印文件中可打印的字符，使用`strings`命令配合`grep`命令可以把flag提取出来。
    finn@pico-2018-shell-2:/problems/strings_4_40d221755b4a0b134c2a7a2e825ef95f$ strings strings |grep picoCTF    
    picoCTF{sTrIngS_sAVeS_Time_d3ffa29c}
flag:`picoCTF{sTrIngS_sAVeS_Time_d3ffa29c}`
# grep 2
## Question
> This one is a little bit harder. Can you find the flag in
> /problems/grep-2_3_826f886f547acb8a9c3fccb030e8168d/files on the shell
> server? Remember, grep is your friend.
### Hint
> grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)
## Solution
目录下有许多个文件夹，每个文件夹下面又有文件夹和文件。可以使用`grep -r`选项来递归的搜寻文件。
    finn@pico-2018-shell-2:/problems/grep-2_3_826f886f547acb8a9c3fccb030e8168d/files$ grep -r picoCTF             
    files2/file20:picoCTF{grep_r_and_you_will_find_556620f7}
flag:`picoCTF{grep_r_and_you_will_find_556620f7}`
# Aca-Shell-A
## Question
> It's never a bad idea to brush up on those linux skills or even learn some
> new ones before you set off on this adventure! Connect with `nc
> 2018shell1.picoctf.com 27833`.
### Hint
> Linux for [Beginners](https://maker.pro/education/basic-linux-commands-for-> beginners)
## Solution
这题用到了以下的基础linux命令：
  * `ls`
  * `cd`
  * `rm`
  * `whoami`
  * `cat`
  * 如何执行二进制可执行文件
依照指示输入命令就可以了。
    $ nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 27833
    Sweet! We have gotten access into the system but we aren't root.
    It's some sort of restricted shell! I can't see what you are typing
    but I can see your output. I'll be here to help you along.
    If you need help, type "echo 'Help Me!'" and I'll see what I can do
    There is not much time left!
    ~/$ ls
    blackmail
    executables
    passwords
    photos
    secret
    ~/$ cd secret
    Now we are cookin'! Take a look around there and tell me what you find!
    ~/secret$ ls
    intel_1
    intel_2
    intel_3
    intel_4
    intel_5

    Sabatoge them! Get rid of all their intel files!
    ~/secret$ rm intel*
    Nice! Once they are all gone, I think I can drop you a file of an exploit!
    Just type "echo 'Drop it in!' " and we can give it a whirl!
    ~/secret$ echo 'Drop it in!'
    Drop it in!
    I placed a file in the executables folder as it looks like the only place we can execute from!
    Run the script I wrote to have a little more impact on the system!
    ~/secret$ cd ..
    ~/$ cd executables
    ~/executables$ ls  
    dontLookHere
    ~/executables$ ./dontLookHere
    ...
    ...
    ...
    Looking through the text above, I think I have found the password. I am just having trouble with a username.
    Oh drats! They are onto us! We could get kicked out soon!
    Quick! Print the username to the screen so we can close are backdoor and log into the account directly!
    You have to find another way other than echo!
    ~/executables$ whoami
    l33th4x0r
    Perfect! One second!
    Okay, I think I have got what we are looking for. I just need to to copy the file to a place we can read.
    Try copying the file called TopSecret in tmp directory into the passwords folder.
    ~/executables$ cp /tmp/TopSecret passwords
    Server shutdown in 10 seconds...
    Quick! go read the file before we lose our connection!
    ~/executables$ cd ..
    ~/$ ls
    blackmail
    executables
    passwords
    photos
    secret
    ~/$ cd passwords
    ~/passwords$ ls
    TopSecret
    ~/passwords$ cat TopSecret
    Major General John M. Schofield's graduation address to the graduating class of 1879 at West Point is as follows: The discipline which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment.On the contrary, such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make an army.It is possible to impart instruction and give commands in such a manner and such a tone of voice as to inspire in the soldier no feeling butan intense desire to obey, while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentment and a desire to disobey.The one mode or other of dealing with subordinates springs from a corresponding spirit in the breast of the commander.He who feels the respect which is due to others, cannot fail to inspire in them respect for himself, while he who feels,and hence manifests disrespect towards others, especially his subordinates, cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself.
