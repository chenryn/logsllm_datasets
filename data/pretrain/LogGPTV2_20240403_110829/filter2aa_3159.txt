- The Internet - circa 2007
- "Open source is more secure."

### EVERYBODY’S JOB IS NOBODY’S JOB
This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody. There was an important job to be done, and Everybody was asked to do it. Everybody was sure Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that because it was Everybody's job. Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't do it. It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done.

### Open Source Projects: A Crucial Role with Limited Support
"Open source projects play a crucial role in the digital age but are maintained by a small, strained cadre of volunteers." These projects often lack the necessary attention and resources, leading to critical issues in functionality, usability, performance, security, stability, and compliance.

### Common Issues in Open Source Libraries
- **C/C++**: When you carry pointers around and cannot track whether they are alive and how long they are, it's going to hurt.
- **Java**: It is not like Java got insecure all of a sudden; it has been insecure for years.
- **PHP**: No strategy, no security contact or reporting defined, inconsistent coding styles, usage, or complex code.

### The Challenge of Change
System administrators often resist change, especially when they have to bear the brunt of its adverse effects. This resistance can hinder the adoption of necessary updates and improvements.

### What Do We Do Now?
- **Demos**:
  - Hadoop HDFS 2.4.1
  - Free Radius 3.0.3
  - Exim (And so can you!)
