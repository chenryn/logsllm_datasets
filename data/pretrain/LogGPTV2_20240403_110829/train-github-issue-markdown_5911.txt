hi
    import cv2
    cap=cv2.VideoCapture("set/your/file/here")
    w = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)
    cnt = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)
    print("Opencv width %d frames %d"%(w,cnt))
    cap.read()
    ts= cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC)
    print("ts @ frame 0 after read %.3f"%ts)
i have run this on my PC and got different results in different versions:
    after 4.1.2:
    ts @ frame 0 after read 0.000
    before 4.1.1:
    ts @ frame 0 after read 40.000
so i am a little confused.
  * which one is (will be) correct in the future?
  * what is the actual meaning of these timestamps? (start time ? end time ? )
thanks
