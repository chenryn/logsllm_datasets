A have revived from previous failures in the
time slot. In this case, it is possible that a new choice of
backup set with less communication cost becomes available
and the system needs to make a decision on whether to re-
conﬁgure. In IATP policy, such decision is made based on
a threshold as follows. The system ﬁrst ﬁnds the statically
optimal backup set that incurs the minimum communica-
tion cost, denoted by ¯St+1
A , based on the current set of alive
candidate content servers, using the algorithms described
in Section 4. It then calculate the ratio of the communica-
tion cost of St
A . If the ratio is greater than
a threshold ψ (ψ ≥ 1), then the system reconﬁgures the
A = ¯St+1
backup set to ¯St+1
A ; otherwise, it keeps
the current one, i.e., St+1
A , i.e., St+1
A = St
A.
A to that of ¯St+1
The threshold ψ acts as a tunable parameter of the policy.
Intuitively, the greater the value of ψ is, the less aggressive
the policy is, and this results in more communication cost
but less reconﬁguration cost. The choice of ψ depends on
the weighting factor β. Note that ECP policy is a special
case of IATP where the parameter ψ is set to 1.
Fig. 7 shows how the communication cost and reconﬁg-
uration cost are affected by the threshold Ψ when the IATP
policy is adopted. The experiment parameters are the same
as for Fig. 6. The ﬁgure shows that when the value of Ψ in-
creases, the communication cost increases and the reconﬁg-
uration cost decreases. Percentage wise, the reconﬁguration
cost is more sensitive to Ψ than the communication cost is.
This is due to the adding-only behavior of IATP when com-
puting new backup sets in Case 2.
Intuitively, according
to the observations we acquired in Section 4, much of the
backup set are vicinity nodes that stay close to NA; reusing
these nodes in the new backup set reduces the reconﬁgu-
ration cost without increasing much in the communication
cost. Fig.8 shows how the overall cost is affected by the
threshold Ψ when the system has a different weighting fac-
tor β for the reconﬁguration cost. The ﬁgures show that for
small β (e.g., Fig. 8.a), ECP , which is a special case of
IATP where Ψ = 1, is actually the best policy. This does
not hold anymore for other values of β (e.g., Fig.8.b-d), and
IATP provides the tunability for ﬁnding a better dynamic re-
conﬁguration policy. The optimal value of Ψ = 1 depends
on β and generally a greater β needs a greater Ψ.
6 Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we have studied the problem of selecting
cost-effective replication locations in content resiliency ser-
vice networks in the presence of both correlated failures and
independent failures. We proposed a general approach to
modeling correlated failures in an representable, quantiﬁ-
able and consistent way and applied the approach in model-
ing geographically correlated failures in content resiliency
services. Using the failure models, we formulated the prob-
lem of selecting cost-effective replication locations against
both independent and geographically correlated failures and
developed two types of algorithms for solving this con-
strained cost minimization problem. We ﬁrst developed a
branch-and-bound algorithm, which is practically capable
of ﬁnding real optimal solutions for content resiliency ser-
vice with up to 30 servers. We then conducted case studies
on small-scale problems to observe properties of the opti-
mal solutions and proposed heuristic-based algorithms that
are computationally efﬁcient for large-scale problems yet
generate high-quality solutions. Furthermore, for content
resiliency service networks that need dynamic reconﬁgura-
tion of replication locations, we also studied reconﬁguration
policies for reducing the long-term overall prevention cost,
including both the communication cost and the reconﬁgu-
ration cost. A straightforward reconﬁguration policy, Eager
Change Policy (ECP), was studied ﬁrst and its limitation
was revealed. We then proposed an Incremental Adjustment
With Thresholds Policy (IATP) that provides the tunability
to make tradeoffs between the communication cost and the
reconﬁguration cost.
