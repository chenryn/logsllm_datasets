4.1 Daily Active IP Cameras Listed on Insecam
Figure 1 shows the number of daily active IP cameras in the time period during
which we ran our crawler. We can see that there are about 20,000 to 25,000
active cameras shown on insecam each day. Those cameras only represent the
tip of the iceberg, since the site administrator claimed to have ﬁltered out all
cameras which may invade people’s private life. Furthermore, any visitors to
insecam have direct access to the live video feeds of those cameras from across
the world, which suggests a very serious privacy issue caused by IP cameras with
no password protection.
4.2 Daily New Cameras Added on Insecam
The number of daily new cameras reﬂects the popularity of insecam, to some
extent. We also examine how many new cameras are added to insecam daily. By
new cameras, we mean the cameras which IP addresses are not seen before in
our current dataset. It is possible that an IP camera could have a diﬀerent IP
address if DHCP is enabled. Considering the claim made by insecam that all IP
cameras are manually added, we assume that the use of DHCP would not cause
the same IP camera to be given a new camera ID. We reached out to the site
admin to conﬁrm but received no response.
Figure 2 shows the number of daily new cameras on insecam in the time
window we monitored. The daily new camera number varies greatly with date,
with the maximum of 537, the minimum of 67, and the average number of 215.
Thus, insecam seems to have developed quite well since November 2014, at the
time insecam was rebuked by many medias [8,10,11].

4.3 Top Timezone with Most Cameras Collected on Insecam
IP cameras on insecam are well organized by timezone. We would like to know
which geographic areas contribute most cameras to insecam. We conﬁrmed that
the geolocation information provided by insecam is correct by comparing the
geolocation information shown on insecam with the information returned by
Maxmind for the same IP. Figure 3(a) depicts top 10 timezones with the most
IP cameras disclosed on insecam. The timezone UTC+01:00, mainly representing
Western Europe, contributes the most cameras and has 5,186 active cameras
listed on average at a time, occupying 23.1% of all active cameras worldwide.
The timezone UTC+02:00, mainly referring to Eastern Europe, comes second,
with the average number of 4,522 cameras. The third and fourth timezones are
UTC+09:00 (Northeast Asia) and UTC-05:00 (Eastern America), with 2,414
and 2,186 active cameras on average, respectively. In summary, the three geo-
graphic regions - Europe, East Asia, and North America - contribute the most
IP cameras on insecam, 87.4% in total.

4.4 Usage Habit of IP Cameras Within a Day
During our several times of polling of an IP camera within a day, we always
observed that a proportion of IP cameras become inaccessible within some time
period. We conjecture that the IP camera owners may often turn oﬀ their cam-
eras during some time period in a day. Thus, we would like to examine the
diurnal pattern of usage of IP cameras within a day.
We analyze the change in the average number of active IP cameras per hour
within a single day throughout the 18 days for the timezone UTC+01:00, the one
with the most IP cameras on insecam, and illustrate the results in Fig. 3(b). It
clearly shows that the number of active IP cameras2 does change with the hour
of the day. Speciﬁcally, there are more IP cameras to be on during the nighttime

period from 17:00 in the afternoon to 5:00 in the next early morning, except
the time 19:00, probably an outlier. And the active IP camera number peaks at
1:00 am. In contrast, there are fewer IP cameras on in the daytime, from 6:00 to
16:00 in the ﬁgure. The ﬁnding seems reasonable given that the main purpose
of IP cameras is to increase safety and prevent crime.
5 Characterization of Insecam IP Cameras
In this section, we examine various characteristics of the IP cameras listed on
insecam. We want to answer the following questions: (1) what countries are
having the most vulnerable IP cameras without password protection, (2) what
organizations are hosting those cameras, (3) where are they being installed, (4)
what are the manufacturers of those cameras, and (5) what TCP/UDP ports
are used by IP cameras for communication to its administrative interface.
5.1 Top Countries and ISPs Contributing Insecam IP Cameras
As mentioned before, the currently active IP cameras on insecam are from up to
136 countries, that is, 209 IP cameras on average per country. Figure 4(a) shows
the top 10 countries which contribute 61.2% IP cameras on insecam. United
States tops the list and has more than 4,500 IP cameras listed on insecam,
22.5% out of all insecam cameras. Turkey and Japan come second and third,
with 1,604 and 1,303 IP cameras, respectively. It seems that all the top 10
countries are either developed countries or countries with large populations.

Fig. 4. (a) Top 10 countries contributing the most IP cameras on insecam. (b) Top 10
ISP responsible for the IP addresses of insecam cameras.
By querying the IP addresses of insecam cameras in an online IP geoloca-
tion database [5], we obtain the corresponding ISP information. There are 4,094
unique ISPs responsible for the IP addresses of insecam cameras. Figure 4(b)
provides the top 10 ISPs and their origin countries. Reasonably, the top ISPs
belong to the top 10 countries in Fig. 4(a). Speciﬁcally, three out of the top
10 ISPs are from United States, which are Comcast, Spectrum, and Verizon.
In addition, up to 296 (7.2%) ISPs could be identiﬁed to be universities and
colleges, from 26 countries.

Installation Locations of Insecam IP Cameras
insecam assigns a tag describing the subject or installation location of the video
feed (e.g., animal, street). We veriﬁed the correctness of the installation location
information provided on insecam by manually viewing tens of camera live feeds.
Based on the tag information associated with 7,602 IP cameras, we present the
distribution of insecam IP cameras by installation location in Fig. 5(a). It shows
that most IP cameras are being installed in public places such as street, city,
beach, mountain, and parking lots, and only a small proportion are deployed in
private areas such as pool, oﬃce, and house. However, the results do not reﬂect
the whole picture of vulnerable IP cameras in the world, given that insecam was
almost shut down by authorities in 2014 due to too many private IP cameras
being streamed on the site at that time [8,10,11] and that the site administrator
claims in the home page that only ﬁltered cameras are available on the site and
the site does not stream private or unethical cameras. Nevertheless, the video
feeds of a signiﬁcant proportion of current active insecam cameras still contain
privacy-sensitive content.
