s390_sthyi \- emulate sthyi instruction
.sh synopsis

.br "#include " "      /* definition of " sys_* " constants */"
.b #include 
.pp

.fi
.pp
.ir note :
glibc provides no wrapper for
.br s390_sthyi (),
necessitating the use of
.br syscall (2).
.sh description
the
.br s390_sthyi ()
system call emulates the sthyi (store hypervisor information) instruction.
it provides hardware resource information for the machine and its
virtualization levels.
this includes cpu type and capacity, as well as the machine model and
other metrics.
.pp
the
.i function_code
argument indicates which function to perform.
the following code(s) are supported:
.tp
.b sthyi_fc_cp_ifl_cap
return cp (central processor) and ifl (integrated facility for linux)
capacity information.
.pp
the
.i resp_buffer
argument specifies the address of a response buffer.
when the
.i function_code
is
.br sthyi_fc_cp_ifl_cap ,
the buffer must be one page (4k) in size.
if the system call returns 0,
the response buffer will be filled with cpu capacity information.
otherwise, the response buffer's content is unchanged.
.pp
the
.i return_code
argument stores the return code of the sthyi instruction,
using one of the following values:
.tp
0
success.
.tp
4
unsupported function code.
.pp
for further details about
.ir return_code ,
.ir function_code ,
and
.ir resp_buffer ,
see the reference given in notes.
.pp
the
.i flags
argument is provided to allow for future extensions and currently
must be set to 0.
.sh return value
on success (that is: emulation succeeded), the return value of
.br s390_sthyi ()
matches the condition code of the sthyi instructions, which is a value
in the range [0..3].
a return value of 0 indicates that cpu capacity information is stored in
.ir *resp_buffer .
a return value of 3 indicates "unsupported function code" and the content of
.ir *resp_buffer
is unchanged.
the return values 1 and 2 are reserved.
.pp
on error, \-1 is returned, and
.ir errno
is set to indicate the error.
.sh errors
.tp
.b efault
the value specified in
.i resp_buffer
or
.i return_code
is not a valid address.
.tp
.b einval
the value specified in
.i flags
is nonzero.
.tp
.b enomem
allocating memory for handling the cpu capacity information failed.
.tp
.b eopnotsupp
the value specified in
.i function_code
is not valid.
.sh versions
this system call is available since linux 4.15.
.sh conforming to
this linux-specific system call is available only on the s390 architecture.
.sh notes
for details of the sthyi instruction, see
.ur https://www.ibm.com\:/support\:/knowledgecenter\:/ssb27u_6.3.0\:/com.ibm.zvm.v630.hcpb4\:/hcpb4sth.htm
the documentation page
.ue .
.pp
when the system call interface is used, the response buffer doesn't
have to fulfill alignment requirements described in the sthyi
instruction definition.
.pp
the kernel caches the response (for up to one second, as of linux 4.16).
subsequent system call invocations may return the cached response.

fpathconf, pathconf \- get configuration values for files
.sh synopsis
.nf
.b #include 
.pp
.bi "long fpathconf(int " fd ", int " name );
.bi "long pathconf(const char *" path ", int " name );
.fi
.sh description
.br fpathconf ()
gets a value for the configuration option
.i name
for the open file descriptor
.ir fd .
.pp
.br pathconf ()
gets a value for configuration option
.i name
for the filename
.ir path .
.pp
the corresponding macros defined in
.i 
are minimum values; if an application wants to take advantage of values
which may change, a call to
.br fpathconf ()
or
.br pathconf ()
can be made, which may yield more liberal results.
.pp
setting
.i name
equal to one of the following constants returns the following
configuration options:
.tp
.b _pc_link_max
the maximum number of links to the file.
if
.i fd
or
.i path
refer to a directory, then the value applies to the whole directory.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_link_max .
.tp
.b _pc_max_canon
the maximum length of a formatted input line, where
.i fd
or
.i path
must refer to a terminal.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_max_canon .
.tp
.b _pc_max_input
the maximum length of an input line, where
.i fd
or
.i path
must refer to a terminal.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_max_input .
.tp
.b _pc_name_max
the maximum length of a filename in the directory
.i path
or
.ir fd
that the process is allowed to create.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_name_max .
.tp
.b _pc_path_max
the maximum length of a relative pathname when
.i path
or
.i fd
is the current working directory.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_path_max .
.tp
.b _pc_pipe_buf
the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe of fifo.
for
.br fpathconf (),
.i fd
should refer to a pipe or fifo.
for
.br fpathconf (),
.i path
should refer to a fifo or a directory; in the latter case,
the returned value corresponds to fifos created in that directory.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_pipe_buf .
.tp
.b _pc_chown_restricted
this returns a positive value if the use of
.br chown (2)
and
.br fchown (2)
for changing a file's user id is restricted to a process
with appropriate privileges,
and changing a file's group id to a value other than the process's
effective group id or one of its supplementary group ids
is restricted to a process with appropriate privileges.
according to posix.1,
this variable shall always be defined with a value other than \-1.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_chown_restricted .
.ip
if
.i fd
or
.i path
refers to a directory,
then the return value applies to all files in that directory.
.tp
.b _pc_no_trunc
this returns nonzero if accessing filenames longer than
.b _posix_name_max
generates an error.
the corresponding macro is
.br _posix_no_trunc .
.tp
.b _pc_vdisable
this returns nonzero if special character processing can be disabled, where
.i fd
or
.i path
must refer to a terminal.
.sh return value
the return value of these functions is one of the following:
.ip * 3
on error, \-1 is returned and
.i errno
is set to indicate the error
(for example,
.br einval ,
indicating that
.i name
is invalid).
.ip *
if
.i name
corresponds to a maximum or minimum limit, and that limit is indeterminate,
\-1 is returned and
.i errno
is not changed.
(to distinguish an indeterminate limit from an error, set
.i errno
to zero before the call, and then check whether
.i errno
is nonzero when \-1 is returned.)
.ip *
if
.i name
corresponds to an option,
a positive value is returned if the option is supported,
and \-1 is returned if the option is not supported.
.ip *
otherwise,
the current value of the option or limit is returned.
this value will not be more restrictive than
the corresponding value that was described to the application in
.i 
or
.i 
when the application was compiled.
