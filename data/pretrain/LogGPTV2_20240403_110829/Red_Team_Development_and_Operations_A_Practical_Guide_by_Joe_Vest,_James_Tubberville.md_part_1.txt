Authors' Statement
"A great deal of time and money is spent on protecting critical digital assets. Many organizations
focus their security testing on compliance or limited scope reviews of a system. These limited tests
often leave an organization with a false sense of security. Organizations that open themselves to an
assessment of not only their technology but of their people and processes can significantly improve
their security posture and adjust its limited security budget and resources to protect the most critical
assets. Scenario-based testing and Red Team techniques can be used to determine how an
organization really stands up to a realistic and determined threat." - Joe Vest and James Tubberville
Preface
This book is the culmination of years of experience in the information technology and cybersecurity
field. Components of this book have existed as rough notes, ideas, informal and formal processes
developed and adopted by the authors as they led and executed red team engagements over many
years. The concepts described in this book have been used to successfully plan, deliver, and perform
professional red team engagements of all sizes and complexities. Some of these concepts were
loosely documented and integrated into red team management processes, and much was kept as tribal
knowledge. One of the first formal attempts to capture this information was the SANS SEC564 Red
Team Operation and Threat Emulation course. This first effort was an attempt to document these ideas
in a format usable by others. The authors have moved beyond SANS training and use this book to
detail red team operations in a practical guide.
The authors’ goal is to provide practical guidance to aid in the management and execution of
professional red teams. The term ‘Red Team’ is often confused in the cybersecurity space. The terms
roots are based on military concepts that have slowly made their way into the commercial space.
Numerous interpretations directly affect the scope and quality of today’s security engagements. This
confusion has created unnecessary difficulty as organizations attempt to measure threats from the
results of quality security assessments. You quickly understand the complexity of red teaming by
performing a quick google search for the definition, or better yet, search through the numerous
definitions and interpretations posted by security professionals on Twitter. This book was written to
provide a practical solution to address this confusion.
The Red Team concept requires a unique approach different from other security tests. It relies heavily
on well-defined TTPs critical to the successful simulation of realistic threat and adversary
techniques. Proper Red Team results are much more than just a list of flaws identified during other
security tests. They provide a deeper understanding of how an organization would perform against an
actual threat and determine where a security operation’s strengths and weaknesses exist.
Whether you support a defensive or offensive role in security, understanding how Red Teams can be
used to improve defenses is extremely valuable. Organizations spend a great deal of time and money
on the security of their systems. It is critical to have professionals who understand the threat and can
effectively and efficiently operate their tools and techniques safely and professionally. This book will
provide you with the real-world guidance needed to manage and operate a professional Red Team,
conduct quality engagements, understand the role a Red Team plays in security operations. You will
explore Red Team concepts in-depth, gain an understanding of the fundamentals of threat emulation,
and understand tools needed you reinforce your organization’s security posture.

How to use the book
This book was written to provide a practical approach to building and running a professional Red
Team. The book is divided into chapters that roughly match the phases of a Red Team engagement.
Chapters begin by diving into a specific topic to provide background and detail on various Red Team
topics. Each chapter ends with key chapter takeaways and homework. The key chapter takeaways
provide a brief chapter summary and homework lists the steps the reader should take to apply the
specific topics. Working through the homework builds the elements needed for a professional Red
Team. These elements can be used as a roadmap to help a team develop and grow.

Introduction
Designing, deploying, and managing a comprehensive security program is complex and challenging
and, therefore, not an easy task for most. Organizations are influenced and pressured from multiple,
often competing, sources. This pressure can come from customers, compliance, management, peers,
finance, public opinion, and publicly available news, just to name a few. Even when faced with these
challenges, organizations are generally able to overcome these pressures and implement what is
considered to be a robust security program. Organizations can satisfy the various parties and, at least
on paper, describe a security program designed to stop malicious cyber-attacks. As a result, audit and
compliance checks pass, robust patch management systems are deployed, and vulnerability
assessments and penetration tests are conducted. These are significant initial steps toward providing
the means to defend a network from attack. Unfortunately, this often falls short in achieving the
primary goal of preventing, detecting, and responding to real threats. Why? What is missing? The real
question to consider is:
Are organizations truly building security
programs designed to address the threat?
A security program includes many components such as staff, policies, procedures, tools, management,
oversight, incident response, etc. The program is designed and built with the assistance of members
from several different divisions or job functions, all contributing their thoughts and security
requirements. Security programs often use this strategy for ensuring a complete and holistic security
program; however, what or who is often missing? Has anyone on the security operations team ever
seen a bad guy? Has anyone on the team attacked or compromised a network? To what extent? To
quote Peter in the movie Office Space[1]. "I can’t believe what a bunch of nerds we are. We’re
looking up money laundering in a dictionary.” Are teams designing defenses for an enemy they do
not know or understand?
Is the threat included in security planning?
Good intentions by a group of intelligent people do not add up to understanding threats or how they
operate. If the goal of security operations is to prevent, detect, respond, and recover against malicious
actions, it only makes sense to include the opinions of those whom you are defending against.
Unfortunately, security design often excludes the threat or threat perspective. This omission often
leads to the mitigation or acceptance of risks not fully understood or revealed during traditional
security testing and auditing. The result is a severe false sense of security. A real threat knows this
and uses it to their advantage.
Consider This
Does a threat know a target has a robust security program?
Do threats perform actions that will trigger an alert or get
them caught?
Are threats still successful?
If so, why are threats able to successfully achieve its
goals and negatively impact an organization when that
organization has a comprehensive security program? To
understand this,
We must understand the threat to
develop defenses properly.
The security industry uses the term threat, but what is a threat?
Dictionary.com[2] defines threat as:
a declaration of an intention or determination to inflict punishment, injury, etc., in retaliation for, or
conditionally upon, some action or course; menace an indication or warning of probable trouble a
person or thing that threatens.
ISO 27001[3] defines threat as:
A potential cause of an incident, that may result in harm of systems and organization.
NIST[4] defines threat as:
Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including
mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or
the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure,
modification of information, or denial of service. |
Let’s walk through this in the context of cybersecurity threats. A threat is an event that has the
potential to impact an organization adversely. Are security operations teams defending against this
threat? A negative event? Perhaps, but consider including the term threat-actor when using threat. A
threat-actor is the person or group of people behind an attack. A solid defensive strategy must defend
against an intelligent threat-actor determined to cause damage to an organization and not just a
potential event. People are behind cyber-attacks. When the defense considers the tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) of intelligent threat-actors, they begin to understand the real threat. Defenders
can then implement robust security defenses that directly impact the ability a threat-actor has to
perform harmful actions. Shifting security operations from the mindset of "Vulnerable" or "Not
Vulnerable" and adopting an approach that focuses on threat actions will significantly improve the
ability an organization has to not only prevent but also detect and respond to real threats. Diving into
TTPs is the beginning of understanding security through the eyes of the threat. Organizations that use
threat actions to drive their defensive TTPs can make life very difficult for threat-actors and even
protect themselves against unknown or zero-day attacks.
Why do Threats Succeed?
Many organizations currently use audit and compliance, vulnerability assessments, and penetration
testing to evaluate and measure risk to cyber-attack. Why bother with a new, threat-focused approach?
Isn't the identification and mitigation of
vulnerabilities enough?
To answer, you must understand how a threat-actor thinks and acts. Remember, a threat is really an
intelligent person determined to cause harm. It is NOT an exploit of a vulnerability, NOT a piece of
malware, or NOT a phishing attack. These are merely the means a threat-actor may choose to achieve
their end goal. The threat-actor assumes the target has a comprehensive security program and a suite
of security tools (firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti-virus, EDR, etc.) deployed with the
intent of stopping cyber-attacks. A good threat-actor will likely assume an organization has deployed
patches, conducted vulnerability assessments to reduce the exploit attack surface, and conducted
penetration tests to identify attack paths. This understanding can significantly change the actions taken
by a threat-actor. These actions can be quite different compared to the actions taken by a traditional
security tester. Does the threat-actor fire up a port scanner and enumerate an entire network? Does a
threat-actor run a vulnerability scanning tool to find an exploit? Attacks by threat-actors do not
always follow the models adopted by traditional security testing. An attack is not scan -> exploit ->
profit. An intelligent threat-actor evaluates what a target presents and uses weakness not always
discovered through traditional security tests. A "good" threat-actor will take several controlled steps
to gain access to a target, establish command and control, establish persistence, perform situational
awareness, to ultimately achieve their desired goal. The people charged with defending an
organization often ignore or misunderstand the steps taken by a threat-actor. This misunderstanding
often leads to a focus on prevention, not detection. Defenders who do focus on detection may drown
themselves in un-actionable default or vendor-generated logs and alerts. Have you ever heard a
security operations analyst state, "We have too many logs and alerts to respond!" or “We are just
trying to keep up with ticket volume!”? Why do organizations log what they log? Compliance? In
case they are needed? Vendor’s advice? Organizations are still missing a key piece to all threats;
understanding their actions and TTPs.
Consider this scenario
After evaluating a target network, a threat-actor decides phishing is their chosen method to gain
access. They send a phishing email to a small number of targeted individuals. The phish contains an
excel attachment with a DDE based attack[5]. One of the email recipients opens the attachment. This
