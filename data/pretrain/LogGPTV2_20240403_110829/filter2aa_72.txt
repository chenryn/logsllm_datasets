Common
Pitfalls
Avoid weak connections and 
false conclusions
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Connections 
using Subnets.
Subnets are network 
allocations given to 
potential businesses or 
organizations to host 
Internet-facing 
infrastructure.
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Example: 185.86.167.27 is part of 185.86.167.0/24
Pitfalls with Subnets
○ Subnet sizes could include thousands of 
potential addresses
○ Allocations are not clearly delegated
● Who owns the allocation?
● Is it being resold?
○ Contiguous block of addresses may have 
no relation to each other
○ Medium-to-low connection value
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Connections 
using AS.
Autonomous systems 
advertise subnets on the 
Internet and link through 
peering agreements 
using routing protocols.
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Example: 185.86.167.27 is part of AS29262
Pitfalls with Autonomous Systems
○ Similar to subnets only larger (100,000s)
○ AS name may not reflect the true 
operator of the network
○ Subject to influence and disruption (BGP 
hijacking, DDoS)
○ Low connection value
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Connections 
using WHOIS.
WHOIS is a protocol that 
lets anyone query for 
information about a 
domain, IP address or 
subnet.
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Example: youtubee.xyz WHOIS reveals little
Pitfalls with WHOIS
○ Data is easily faked and not verified by a 
central registry
○ Privacy protect services obfuscate real 
data
○ Domains change owners over time
○ Direct data match does not imply 
connection
○ Medium connection value
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Connections 
using Dynamic 
DNS.
Dynamic DNS provides 
an alternative to the 
traditional process of 
managing DNS records 
for infrastructure that 
frequently changes IP 
addresses.
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Example: youtubee.xyz is not using dynamic DNS
Pitfalls with Dynamic DNS
○ Freely available or extremely cheap
○ Difficult to derive ownership or usage 
time
○ Mimics semantics of a real domain
○ Thousands of possible combinations
○ Medium-to-low connection value
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Connections 
using Sinkholes.
Sinkholes are tools used 
by defenders to redirect 
traffic destined to 
malicious resources in 
order to identify victims 
and avoid future 
compromises.
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Example: 185.86.167.27 is not a sinkhole
Pitfalls with Sinkholes
○ No single registry of sinkhole information
○ May appear to connect unrelated 
infrastructure
○ Could be mistaken for hosting provider
○ Skews time of operations
○ Low connection value
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Connections 
using Hosting 
Providers.
Hosting providers like 
content delivery 
networks, web hosting 
and virtual private 
servers make the 
Internet run. 
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Example: 185.86.167.27 is part of iDeal Hosting in Turkey
Pitfalls with Hosting Providers
○ Associates a lot of activity into one place
○ Potentially obfuscates the true source of 
a destination
○ Could easily be re-used due to resource 
constraints
○ Comes with numerous defaults
○ Low connection value
#knowyourfoe | @PassiveTotal
Avoiding Pitfalls
○ Use analyst systems that allow for 
feedback and automated collection
○ Create a checklist of items to lookout for
● Known sinkholes, dynamic DNS providers, 
hosting providers, etc.
○ Validate conclusions with multiple data 
points
