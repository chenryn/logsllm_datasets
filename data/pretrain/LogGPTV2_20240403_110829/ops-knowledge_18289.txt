User: So for some reason, my computer refuses to see the environment PATH variable. In the path variable, I have:
C:\Python32;
listed, along with all of the other programs, but it doesn't work if I type, "python" into the command window. However, I can type "python" into the run window, and have it run the correct interpreter (I assume because I have an environment variable for that separately...? As you can see, I don't quite understand how to customize this stuff. Any help would be appreciated!
Assistant: I faced the same issue. 
However, in my case, I went through the documentation from python and found where I was making mistake. In the latest python versions, if you type 'python' in cmd, it will show error. 
At the same time, the command that worked for me was 'py'.
So I recommend anyone facing a similar problem to try this - 'py'
