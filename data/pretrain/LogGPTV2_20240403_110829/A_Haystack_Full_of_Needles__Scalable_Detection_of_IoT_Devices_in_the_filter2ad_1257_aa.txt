## Abstract
Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly popular, offering a wide range of functionalities from voice assistants to home appliances. However, these devices often come with significant privacy and security risks, as evidenced by recent large-scale coordinated global attacks that have disrupted major service providers. A critical first step in addressing these risks is to identify the presence and location of IoT devices within a network. While some limited solutions exist, a key challenge is whether device discovery can be achieved by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) using only sampled flow statistics.

In this paper, we develop and evaluate a scalable methodology to accurately detect and monitor IoT devices at subscriber lines with limited, highly sampled data. Our findings indicate that millions of IoT devices can be detected and identified within hours, both at a major ISP and an Internet Exchange Point (IXP), using passive, sparsely sampled network flow headers. Our methodology can detect devices from more than 77% of the studied IoT manufacturers, including popular devices such as smart speakers. While our methodology is effective for providing network analytics, it also highlights significant privacy concerns.

## 1. Introduction
The number of IoT devices deployed in homes is increasing rapidly. It is estimated that by the end of 2019, more than 9.5 billion IoT devices were active, and this number is expected to rise to 20 billion by 2025 [1]. These devices include virtual assistants, smart home controls, cameras, and smart TVs. While users deploy some IoT devices explicitly, they are often unaware of the security threats and privacy consequences associated with their use [2]. Major ISPs are developing strategies to deal with large-scale coordinated attacks from these devices.

Existing solutions focus on instrumenting testbeds or home environments to collect and analyze full packet captures [3–5], local search for IoT anomalies [6, 7], active measurements [8, 9], or data from antivirus companies running scan campaigns from users' homes [7]. However, these data sources alone do not provide sufficient insights to prevent network-wide attacks from IoT devices [10]. Detecting IoT devices from an ISP's perspective can help identify suspicious traffic and common devices among subscriber lines generating that traffic.

In this paper, we present a methodology for detecting home IoT devices in the wild at an ISP and an IXP, relying on passive, sampled network traces and active probing experiments. We build on the insight that IoT devices typically rely on backend infrastructure hosted in the cloud to offer their services. When contacting such infrastructure, they expose information, including their traffic destinations, even when a device is not in use [4].

One of the challenges in detecting IoT devices at scale is the poor availability and low granularity of data sources. The available data is often in the form of centrally-collected aggregate and sampled data (e.g., NetFlow [11], IPFIX traces [12]). Therefore, we need a methodology that (a) does not rely on payload and (b) handles sparsely sampled data.

Another challenge is the diversity of traffic patterns across IoT devices and their services. For example, some devices, like cameras, generate significant continuous traffic, while others, like smart plugs, are mainly passive unless used. Moreover, many devices offer the same service, such as the Alexa voice assistant [13], which is available on several brands of smart speakers and Amazon Fire TV devices. Here, the traffic patterns may depend on the service rather than the specific IoT device. Some services rely on dedicated backend infrastructures, while others may use shared ones, such as CDNs. Thus, we need a methodology that identifies which IoT services are detectable from the traffic and then identifies a unique traffic pattern for each IoT device and associated services.

Our key insight is that we can address these challenges by focusing our analysis on the types of destinations contacted by IoT devices. Even with sparsely sampled data, the set of servers contacted by an IoT device over time can form a reasonably unique signature that is revealed in as little as a few hours. However, this approach has limitations, such as the inability to detect devices or services that use a shared infrastructure with unrelated services (e.g., CDNs).

### Contributions
- **Detection of IoT Devices**: We show that it is possible to detect the presence of IoT devices at subscriber lines using sparsely sampled flow captures from a large residential ISP and a major IXP, even if the device is idle. Specifically, we were able to recognize that 20% of 15 million subscriber lines used at least one of the 56 different IoT products in our testbed.
- **Scalability and Accuracy**: We highlight that our technique scales, is accurate, and can identify millions of IoT devices within minutes, in a non-intrusive way from passive, sampled data. In the case of the ISP, we were able to detect the presence of devices from 72% of our target manufacturers within 1 hour, sometimes within minutes.
- **Insights and Implications**: Based on our findings, we discuss why some IoT devices are faster to detect, how to hide an IoT service, and how detectability can be used to improve IoT services and network troubleshooting.

## 2. Controlled Experiments for IoT Detection

### 2.1. Network Setting
We utilize two vantage points for our data collection: a large European ISP and a major European IXP.

#### ISP (ISP-VP)
The ISP is a large residential ISP that offers Internet services to over 15 million broadband subscriber lines. The ISP uses NetFlow [11] to monitor traffic flows at all border routers in its network, using a consistent sampling rate across all routers. Figure 3 shows where NetFlow data is collected.

#### IXP (IXP-VP)
The IXP facilitates traffic exchange between its members, with more than 800 members, including international ones, and peak traffic exceeding 8 Tbps. The IXP uses IPFIX [12] to collect traffic data across its switching fabric at a consistent sampling rate, which is an order of magnitude lower than the one used at the ISP. Figure 4 illustrates where the IPFIX data is collected.

### Ethical Considerations
Neither the ISP nor the IXP flow data contains any payload data, thus no user information. We distinguish user IPs from server IPs and anonymize by hashing all user IPs, following the method described in [5]. The address space of the ISP's residential users is known. We classify an IP as a server IP if it receives or transmits traffic on well-known ports or if it belongs to ASes of cloud or CDN providers. The ports include, e.g., web ports (80, 443, 8080), NTP (123), DNS (53). Additionally, we do not have access to specific user activity and can only access and report aggregated statistics in accordance with the policies of the ISP and IXP.

### Subscriber Line (Home-VP) Network Setup
To ingest ground truth traffic into the network, we need privileged access to a home subscriber line. For this, we use the ISP-VP but place a VPN endpoint with an IP outside the /28 subscriber’s prefix and use it to tunnel IoT traffic from two IoT testbeds, one in Europe and one in the US, as shown in Figure 3. The measurement points within the ISP will also capture this traffic, and we simply exclude this traffic from our dataset, as the VPN tunnel endpoints are known.

### Communication Patterns
To understand the detectability of IoT devices, we focus on the communication patterns of end-user IoT services and the types of destinations they contact. Figure 1 shows three possible communication patterns on top of a typical network topology, including three households, an ISP, a dedicated infrastructure, and a CDN hosting multiple servers. Device A is deployed by two subscribers and contacts one server in the dedicated infrastructure. Device B is deployed by a single subscriber and contacts both a dedicated server and a CDN server. Device C is deployed by two subscribers and contacts only CDN servers. Using NetFlow traces at the ISP edge, it is possible to identify subscriber lines with these devices.
