### Server Hardening and SSL/TLS Configuration

**Server Hardening:**
Server hardening is the process of securing a server through configuration. This includes disabling unnecessary services, removing unused services or user accounts, rotating default passwords, setting appropriate server headers, and other security measures. While it's not necessary to know every detail of configuring every type of server, understanding the concepts and knowing what to look for can help in assessing potential targets.

**SSL/TLS Configuration:**
Another useful scanning tool is the SSL Server Test from Qualys SSL Labs. This tool analyzes a server’s SSL/TLS configuration and compares it against current best practices. It also identifies SSL/TLS-related vulnerabilities such as POODLE and Heartbleed. Let's scan `www.megacorpone.com` and review the results.

- [POODLE Vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE)
- [Heartbleed Vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed)

**SSL Server Test Results:**
The results for `www.megacorpone.com` show that the server supports TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1, which are considered legacy due to their use of insecure cipher suites. For example, the `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA` suite has been recommended to be disabled for several years due to vulnerabilities in both AES Cipher Block Chaining mode and the SHA1 algorithm. These findings provide insights into the security practices, or lack thereof, within the target organization.

### Active Information Gathering

**Learning Objectives:**
- Perform Netcat and Nmap port scanning.
- Conduct DNS, SMB, SMTP, and SNMP enumeration.
- Understand Living off the Land techniques.

In this section, we will move beyond passive information gathering and explore techniques that involve direct interaction with target services. We will cover common active information gathering techniques, including port scanning and DNS, SMB, SMTP, and SNMP enumeration.

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Kali Linux Tools:** We will primarily use pre-installed tools on our local Kali machine.
- **Living off the Land (LOLBAS):** In scenarios where we don't have access to Kali Linux, we can leverage pre-installed and trusted Windows binaries, scripts, and libraries (LOLBAS) for post-compromise analysis.

### DNS Enumeration

**DNS Overview:**
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. It is one of the most critical systems on the internet, organized hierarchically into zones. Common types of DNS records include:
- **NS (Nameserver):** Contains the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
- **A (Host Record):** Contains the IPv4 address of a hostname.
- **AAAA (Quad A Host Record):** Contains the IPv6 address of a hostname.
- **MX (Mail Exchange):** Contains the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain.
- **PTR (Pointer):** Used in reverse lookup zones to find the records associated with an IP address.
- **CNAME (Canonical Name):** Creates aliases for other host records.
- **TXT (Text):** Can contain any arbitrary data and be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.

**DNS Enumeration Techniques:**
- **Using the `host` Command:**
  - To find the IP address of `www.megacorpone.com`:
    ```bash
    kali@kali:~$ host www.megacorpone.com
    www.megacorpone.com has address 149.56.244.87
    ```
  - To find MX records:
    ```bash
    kali@kali:~$ host -t mx megacorpone.com
    megacorpone.com mail is handled by 10 fb.mail.gandi.net.
    megacorpone.com mail is handled by 20 spool.mail.gandi.net.
    megacorpone.com mail is handled by 50 mail.megacorpone.com.
    megacorpone.com mail is handled by 60 mail2.megacorpone.com.
    ```
  - To find TXT records:
    ```bash
    kali@kali:~$ host -t txt megacorpone.com
    megacorpone.com descriptive text "Try Harder"
    megacorpone.com descriptive text "google-site-verification=U7B_b0HNeBtY4qYGQZNsEYXfCJ32hMNV3GtC0wWq5pA"
    ```

- **Brute Forcing DNS Records:**
  - Using a wordlist to guess valid hostnames:
    ```bash
    kali@kali:~$ for ip in $(cat list.txt); do host $ip.megacorpone.com; done
    www.megacorpone.com has address 149.56.244.87
    Host ftp.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
    mail.megacorpone.com has address 51.222.169.212
    Host owa.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
    Host proxy.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
    router.megacorpone.com has address 51.222.169.214
    ```

- **Reverse DNS Lookups:**
  - Scanning IP ranges for reverse DNS entries:
    ```bash
    kali@kali:~$ for ip in $(seq 200 254); do host 51.222.169.$ip; done | grep -v "not found"
    ...
    208.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer admin.megacorpone.com.
    209.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer beta.megacorpone.com.
    210.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer fs1.megacorpone.com.
    211.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer intranet.megacorpone.com.
    212.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail.megacorpone.com.
    213.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail2.megacorpone.com.
    214.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer router.megacorpone.com.

    216.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer snmp.megacorpone.com.
    217.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer syslog.megacorpone.com.
    218.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer support.megacorpone.com.
    219.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer tesst.megacorpone.com.
    220.169.222.51.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer vpn.megacorpone.com.
    ...
    ```
