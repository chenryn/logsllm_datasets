optical ﬁber and standard preampliﬁer were placed as close
to the antenna as possible (shown in Figure 5), providing
high SNR at great distances. The acquisition system oper-
ated within the 2.4 GHz ISM band, using only OFDM and
Binary Phase-shift Keying (BPSK) modulation, meeting the
802.11X speciﬁcation for beacons. To account for IoT de-
vices, which may interfere, a highly directional high gain
ARA horn antenna obtained the signal. Cross-correlation,
which ampliﬁes a high speciﬁc signal, also mitigated thermal
and other interference.
4.1 System Design
In this section, challenges include mimicking a transmit
Wi-Fi router using 802.11 standards and storing the signals.
The NI RF test bed must stream the received signals for an
entire duration in which persons stroll through a room and
hallway. The horn antenna has the ability to discriminate
between horizontal and vertically polarized signals. In this
experiment, by measuring the horizontal component of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, the antenna is able to sense shifts from
the vertical component. Thus when a vertical component
becomes horizontal due to multipathing, the electromagnetic
waves’ horizontal component suddenly increases.
A transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) pair operated on
the same NI PXIE system. The TX generated a pulsing
OFDM signal at 1/3 duty cycle simulating a Wi-Fi beacon
signal using an omni-direction (shown in Figure 4). The RX
digitized the baseband signal, streaming the oversampled
digitized values to the redundant array of independent disks
(RAID) drive. Processing the stream value, an algorithm de-
modulated the OFDM signal and recovered the pilot tone.
The received pilot tones were compared to the transmitted
values, and the Doppler signature was computed. The re-

nal by copying portions of the end signal. This preﬁx added
signal is the deﬁnition of a symbol, representing binary data.

(5)
Where L is the length of the preﬁx.
The reason why OFDM is such a popular encoding scheme
is that multiple bits can be sent simultaneously (Figure 6)
using multiple sub-carriers. With guard intervals, cyclic pre-
ﬁx, rate control, and equalization schemes these signals are
resilient against Doppler, multipathing, and fading interfer-
ence. To simulate a beacon, the signal consisted of 20 MHz
of bandwidth with 51 active subcarriers. The 51 carriers,
derived from 51 bits, were summed together by the parallel
to serial converter. OFDM utilizes the inverse Fast Fourier
Transform (iFFT) to allow the subcarriers to be orthogo-
nal, allowing for high spectral eﬃciency (shown in Figure
6). Modern communication systems deﬁne speciﬁc subcar-
riers as pilot tones, sent to perform channel estimation. To
simulate this scheme, the NI system used an arbitrary wave
generator (AWG) at baseband, up-converting the signal to
2.412 GHz, and sending pulsed OFDM signals at 1/3 duty
cycle. This up-conversion process centers the baseband sig-
nal (Figure 7) to the desired transmit frequency by ﬁrst
up-sampling, then multiplying with a desired frequency sine
wave, and ﬁnally high-pass ﬁltering.
4.3 Encoding Mechanism: Doppler Shift and
Multipath
This section discusses the Doppler channel and multipath
encoding an electromagnetic wave caused by individuals’ at-
tributes when moving. The challenge addressed in this sec-
tion is modelling Doppler Eﬀect and multipath based on
human gait. The human body moves about 1.4 meters per
second, which translates to an approximate 11 Hz shift based
on the Doppler Eﬀect. Other papers, however, have demon-
strated that movements of legs, arms, and feet happen much
faster, at around 200-300 Hz, yielding about 20-40 meters
per second [23]. The shift occurs from the electromagnetic
waves reﬂecting oﬀ of a moving body (shown in Figure 8).
Incorporating the three frequency components from arm,
leg, body, and original signal yields Equation 6.

After extracting the components of the velocity vector, the
equation simpliﬁes to Equation 7:
Figure 5: Horn antenna, preamp, and RF over ﬁber capture
RF signals, provided directionality, and increased SNR in a
real world deployment. The NI RF test bed consists of sig-
nal acquisition (PXIe-5622), signal generation (PXIe-5652),
down-converter (PXIe-5601), and up-converter (PXIe-5450).
4.2 OFDM Signal Design
This section discusses the theories of generating a Wi-
Fi beacon, which uses an OFDM BPSK modulation and a
cyclic preﬁx. The challenges addressed in this section in-
clude simulating a Wi-Fi beacon with CSI estimating pi-
lot tones and generating the ISM band signal. An OFDM
signal is created by turning binary data into cyclical repre-
sentations, usually taking the form of frequency, amplitude,
or phase. In 802.11 standards for Wi-Fi beacons, this rep-
resentation is Binary Phase Shift Key (BPSK). BPSK has
two states representing 0 and 1.

velocity vector and the Doppler shift could be broken into

When electromagnetic waves propagate and encounter an
object, the waves’ reﬂections and refractions cause diﬀerent
times of arrivals (Figure 9). The signals’ polarities may also
change, and the delayed signals’ powers will be signiﬁcantly
less. Multipath is deﬁned in Equation 8:
ρkej2πf D kδ(t − τk)
(cid:88)
(8)
Where ρk represents power lost during each delay, ejφk rep-
resents the signal, and δ(t − τk) impulse function represents
the delay.
Figure 10: As humans and room conﬁguration change, the
multipath signals also change. Because human gait is rel-
atively consistent, we can encode a human signature using
the physical channel, sensed by Wobly.
As the individuals move or room conﬁgurations change, the
multipaths and Doppler shifts causes the physical channel to
change (Figure 10). By sensing those changes, the system
produces the human signature.
4.4 Receiver Design and Signal Processing
This section discusses converting a high frequency with
Doppler and multipath interference (discussed in section 4.3)
into a usable baseband signal. First, the signal was condi-
tioned by down-converting and down-sampling from 2.412
GHz. Then, a low pass ﬁlter removes the upper side band
signal, which is an upper frequency duplication. These ﬁl-
575ters are typically a digital cascaded integrator comb ﬁnite
impulse response ﬁlter.

Applying the local oscillator frequency, fLO, and the re-

Because the NI system receiver and transmitter used the
same clock, the phase diﬀerence would be zero (Equation 13),
and there would not be any diﬀerence in the received fre-
quency and the oscillator frequency, apart from Doppler
shifts (Equation 14). Because the receiver signal’s frequency
(fR) and the local oscillator (fLO) operate on the same fre-
quency, the processing operated on the baseband signal (de-
ﬁned in Equation 15).
φD − φLO = 0

Thus down-conversion removes the carrier frequency from

4.5 Utilizing OFDM equalization
This section discusses using the theory of OFDM BPSK
demodulation to recover the pilot tones and determine equal-
ization values. These equalization values measure the chan-
nel interference discussed in section 4.3 to form the ﬁrst
feature set. Equalization schemes in modern day communi-
cation standards measure Doppler Eﬀect. The equalization
scheme operates on the pilot tones sent to perform channel
estimation. To obtain the pilot tone levels, an OFDM de-
modulator must be implemented. Because OFDM is a linear
operation, demodulation reverses the modulation operations
using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). By subtracting the
expected and received pilot tones frequency oﬀset over time,
this measurement can provide the Doppler frequency shift
in the signature (shown in Equation 16) (Figure 11).

The signatures were created by measuring the area of
peaks of Sk by using a wavelet transform and coeﬃcients
to ﬁnd valleys and integrating the peaks of all the Sk [1].
Let Sk (jm) be the mth local minimum (described in sec-
tion 4.7). For n local minimums, the feature vector can be
deﬁned in Equation 17.

The premise of correlation is to measure two signals’ similar-

ities. This computation ampliﬁes the desired signal and sup-
presses noise. By multiplying the received and sent signals,
the closer the match, the higher the output would be (Fig-
ure 13). By performing this multiplication on the time do-
main signals and spanning it over time, the algorithm could
detect the multipath signals and remove noise interference
(Figure 12).
