In NumPy 1.13, `numpy.diff()` no longer works with Bool-Arrays:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.diff([True, False, False])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "", line 1, in 
      File ".../lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/function_base.py", line 1926
    , in diff
        return a[slice1]-a[slice2]
    TypeError: numpy boolean subtract, the `-` operator, is deprecated, use the bitwise_xor, the `^` operator, or the logi
    cal_xor function instead.
It worked in NumPy 1.12.1 and the documentation says that it should still
work:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.diff([True, False, False])
    array([ True, False], dtype=bool)
