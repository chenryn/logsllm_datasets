**ATT&CK ID:** S1009  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Triton

The Triton malware includes a file named `TS_cnames.py`, which defines default values for two types of state: program state (`TS_progstate`) and key state (`TS_keystate`). Both of these states are referenced in the `TsHi.py` script. 

For clarity:
- **Program State (TS_progstate):** This state is defined in `TS_cnames.py` and is used within `TsHi.py`.
- **Key State (TS_keystate):** Similarly, this state is also defined in `TS_cnames.py` and is utilized in `TsHi.py`.

This structure suggests that `TS_cnames.py` serves as a configuration file, providing essential state definitions that are then accessed and manipulated by the `TsHi.py` script during the execution of the Triton malware.
