used increases. We observe a similar trend with a steeper decline for
the random strategy. Still, the accuracies of CUMUL and DF remain
comparably high, corresponding to the correct identification of
most page loads. A reason is that both strategies produce subtraces
of similar size for different page load traces belonging to the same
website when used in a setting with a constant 𝑚. Moreover, round
robin cannot completely hide the total size of a given website — one
of the most important features for WFP attacks [19] — even when
observing only a fraction of the page load. Both round robin and
random schemes create traffic diversity in a setting with a variable
number of entry ORs, resulting in accuracy drops of more than 10%.
However, this drop is insufficient for a practical deployment.
By Direction. A simple scheme, which only splits the traffic by
direction, already delivers a significant decrease in accuracy for
all WFP attacks. Even though the number of transferred cells per
direction remains unaltered, most classifiers only recognize a third
of the page loads. This drop might be caused by the classifiers’
inability to retrieve information about the relationship between
incoming and outgoing cells. However, despite the absence of this
characteristic, k-FP profits from other features that use available
information on timing and data rate per direction, contributing to
a comparably high classification rate for this attack.

accuracy compared to the previous schemes. All evaluated WFP
attacks achieve less than 43% accuracy. In case of BWR, we further
reduce the accuracy of all WFP attacks down to 14%. In particular,
the accuracies of CUMUL and DF cannot achieve a detection rate
higher than 7%. For the worst-performing classifier, k-NN, the rate
of reliably-detectable page loads drops below 4%. We believe that
the significant difference in the accuracies between WR and BWR
is caused by the fact that WR cannot fully destroy consecutive se-
quences of Tor cells within a given traffic trace, often exploited by
WFP attacks to extract features (see Appendix A). Another reason
for the significant accuracy decrease achieved by BWR is the diver-
sity in total size among the different subtraces of a single website.
A notable observation is that a variable number of entry ORs does
not improve the efficiency of both splitting schemes, WR and BWR,
as these schemes already introduce a sufficient diversity by design.
To sum up, based on our simulation results in Table 1, we showed
that BWR with a constant number of five entry ORs generates
subtraces with highly diverse characteristics and, thus, serves as
our most effective splitting scheme used in the rest of the paper.
We also believe that the protection of the other splitting schemes
and other combinations of 𝑚 will be worse in case of advanced
attacker scenarios as they already achieve lower protection in our
simulation and will omit this evaluation due to space constraints.
8.1.2 Open-world Evaluation. Next, we evaluate the efficiency of
TrafficSliver-Net using BWR with five entry ORs in an open-world
scenario. In particular, we focus on a scenario where the adversary
aims to detect whether a single (sub-)trace of a testing page belongs
to the foreground set or not, without trying to identify the exact
foreground website. If we are able to reduce the success of the
WFP classifiers in this setting, then their performance will be even

worse in the scenario when the adversary aims to detect the exact
foreground website. As a baseline, we first used the non-defended
datasets ALEXA-NODEF as a foreground set and ALEXA-NODEF-BG as
our background set and computed the receiving operating charac-
teristic (ROC) curve for each classifier. We then applied the simu-
lator from Section 7 to artificially split the non-defended traces in
ALEXA-NODEF, i.e., our foreground set, and the non-defended traces
in ALEXA-NODEF-BG — our background set — using BWR with five
entry ORs. Analogously, we calculated the ROC curve for each clas-
sifier using these defended traces. As shown in Figure 3, we observe
a clear proximity of the curves of all WFP classifiers to the random
guess (black line), when TrafficSliver-Net is applied. While the area
under the curve (AUC) indicating the detection of non-defended
traces using all WFP attacks lies between 0.87 and 0.97 (AUC is one
in case of a perfect classifier), the best-performing classifier, k-FP,
reaches an AUC of only 0.60 when applying our defended dataset.
Moreover, DF, 𝑘-NN, and CUMUL achieve a marginal higher AUC
than random guessing (i.e., AUC = 0.5). Hence, the adversary is not
able to conduct a successful WFP attack in an open-world scenario.
8.1.3 Effectiveness of TrafficSliver-Net in the Real Tor Network.
Once we had identified the best traffic-splitting scheme and the
optimal number of entry ORs, we deployed this strategy in the real
Tor network and collected a real-world dataset (ALEXA-NET-DEF).
We then computed the accuracies of all WFP attacks by using these
defended traces as well as non-defended traces in ALEXA-NODEF,
which we use as a baseline. Table 4 summarizes the accuracy of
each WFP classifier in a closed-world scenario. As we can see, the
classification results obtained by using the defended traces gathered
from the real Tor network are analogous to those results achieved
by using simulated defended traces. In particular, we observe a
dramatic reduction of the detection rate from more than 98% to less
than 16% for all state-of-the-art WFP classifiers. Simultaneously,
TrafficSliver-Net does not introduce any artificial delays or dummy
traffic to counter these WFP attacks. Thus, we can conclude the
effectiveness of our network-layer defense in real-world settings.
Security against More Advanced Adversary. We further ex-

plore the performance of TrafficSliver-Net against an unrealistically
strong attacker that is even aware of the portion of traffic of a com-
plete page load that is transmitted over an observed client-to-entry
connection. To analyze the level of danger for the users in this
scenario, we assume that the attacker possesses two classifiers: one
trained on non-defended traces and another trained on defended
subtraces whose length represents a certain minimum ratio 𝑅 from
the corresponding complete page load. Then, we compute the accu-
racy achieved by these classifiers when the attacker tries to detect
only subtraces whose lengths are at least a given mimimum 𝑅 from

the respective complete page loads. We executed this experiment by
using both datasets ALEXA-NET-DEF and ALEXA-NODEF and k-FP —
the best-performing WFP attack against our defense. Figure 4 shows
the results obtained for a closed-world scenario. While the accuracy
achieved by our classifier trained on defended subtraces is almost
constant and remains below 25% for a minimum 𝑅 ≤ 0.6, the recog-
nition rate of the other classifier trained on non-defended traces
is close to zero for the same range of 𝑅. Hence, we can conclude
that our traffic-splitting-based defense achieves good protection
against WFP attacks as long as each client-to-entry user connec-
tion contains less than 60% of the total length of a given page load.
In contrast, high detection rates are achieved only for subtraces
comprising more than 80% of a complete page load.
Security against Multiple Malicious Entry ORs. Finally, we
8.1.5
consider an even more-powerful adversary controlling 𝑛, 2 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 5,
malicious entry ORs in real victim multipath user connections and,
thus, observing multiple client-to-entry connections utilized to load
a single page. In this scenario, the attacker gains additional knowl-
edge about the complete page load by merging the sequences of Tor
cells that are transmitted through the compromised client-to-entry
connections into a single subtrace. However, in order to achieve
high recognition rate, the adversary needs to also adjust the training
strategy applied for the classifier. To find the best training strategy
in case of multiple malicious ORs, we explore several alternatives
that the adversary can use for the training process. In our first
training strategy, 𝑆1, we assume that the adversarial classifier is
trained on non-defended (i.e., non-split) traces. As in the previous
sections, in the second strategy, 𝑆2, we assume that the attacker
uses all subtraces belonging to a single training page load as sepa-
rate inputs for training the classifier. In the third strategy, 𝑆3, the
traces for training consist of the ordered sequences of Tor cells that
were transmitted through 𝑛 consecutive client-to-entry connections
(e.g., if the total number of entry ORs used by a user is four and the
number of malicious entry ORs is two for a given page load, a single
training trace is the union of two subtraces traversing the first and
the second entry OR). We further study another strategy, 𝑆4, where
the adversary builds training traces by merging 𝑛 randomly-chosen
subtraces. In our last strategy, 𝑆5, the adversary creates all possible
combinations of training traces that consist of 𝑛 merged subtraces
(cid:1) training traces in total). For all experiments, the testing
traces consist of 𝑛 randomly-chosen, merged subtraces (this repre-
sents what an attacker would observe in reality). First, we evaluated
these strategies by using our defended traces in ALEXA-NET-DEF
against 𝑛 = 2 malicious entry ORs. Table 2a shows the classification
results obtained for a closed-world scenario. In case of DF, k-FP,
and CUMUL, the best strategy for the attacker is to use all possi-
ble combinations of two merged subtraces for training (𝑆5) and,
