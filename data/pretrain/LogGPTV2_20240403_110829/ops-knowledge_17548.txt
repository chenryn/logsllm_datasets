When attempting to build `gevent`, I encountered the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

Initially, I tried specifying the architecture with `CFLAGS="-arch x86_64"`, but this did not resolve the issue.

**Solution:**
To solve the problem, I recompiled both `gevent-1.0dev` and `greenlet` using the flags `CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"`. This approach successfully addressed the architecture mismatch and allowed the build to proceed without errors.
