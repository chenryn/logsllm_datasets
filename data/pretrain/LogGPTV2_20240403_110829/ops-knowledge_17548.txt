User: When I build gevent, I get an error

    Traceback (most recent call last):

ImportError: dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Cython-0.14.1-py2.7-macosx-10.4-i386.egg/Cython/Compiler/Code.so, 2): no suitable image found.  Did find:

I tried to specify architecture with CFLAGS="-arch x86_64", but it does not work.
Assistant: Recompilation gevent-1.0dev and greenlet with flags CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" is a solution to my problem.
