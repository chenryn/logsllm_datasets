It's great to hear that you're planning a project using Tornado, Nginx, MySQL, and jQuery on a Linux environment. Given that you are new to Linux and still learning the basics, such as text editors like Vim and Emacs, it's important to set up a supportive development environment. Here are some recommendations to help you get started:

1. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Consider using an IDE like **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** or **PyCharm**. These tools offer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging, which can make your development process smoother. Both VS Code and PyCharm have good support for Python (Tornado), JavaScript (jQuery), and SQL (MySQL).

2. **Text Editors:** If you prefer a more lightweight solution, you can start with **Sublime Text** or **Atom**. These editors are user-friendly and have a gentler learning curve compared to Vim and Emacs. They also have extensive plugin ecosystems that can enhance your productivity.

3. **Terminal Emulator:** Use a terminal emulator like **GNOME Terminal** or **Terminator**. These provide a more modern and user-friendly interface compared to the default terminal. Terminator, in particular, supports multiple split panes, which can be very useful when working with different services.

4. **Package Manager:** Familiarize yourself with a package manager like **APT** (for Debian/Ubuntu) or **YUM** (for CentOS/RHEL). These tools will help you install and manage software packages on your Linux system.

5. **Version Control:** Learn to use **Git** for version control. This is essential for managing your codebase and collaborating with others. Tools like **GitHub** or **GitLab** can provide hosting and additional features like issue tracking and continuous integration.

6. **Documentation and Community Support:**
   - **Tornado:** The official Tornado documentation is comprehensive and well-organized.
   - **Nginx:** The Nginx documentation is detailed and includes many examples.
   - **MySQL:** The MySQL manual is thorough and covers all aspects of the database.
   - **jQuery:** The jQuery API documentation is easy to navigate and includes many examples.

7. **Mentorship and Learning Resources:**
   - Seek out a mentor or a colleague who has experience with Linux and web development. They can provide valuable guidance and help you avoid common pitfalls.
   - Utilize online resources like **Stack Overflow**, **Reddit** (e.g., r/learnprogramming), and **YouTube** tutorials. There are also many free and paid courses available on platforms like **Udemy**, **Coursera**, and **edX**.

By setting up a robust development environment and leveraging these tools and resources, you'll be better equipped to tackle your project. Good luck!
