User: I'm planning to work on a project using Tornado / nginx / mySQL / jQuery and would be using linux (im new to linux too, i barely know what vim / emacs are). Which tools for web development with this stack would you recommend?
Assistant: You're going to have a lot more problems than your choice of framework if this is your first project on a UNIX. I'd recommend you find a clued in person at your workplace who knows the platform fairly well and use her as a teacher rather than rely completely on the web.
