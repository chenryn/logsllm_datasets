User: I have created one Django Application,also hosted it on the google app engine. I can send emails from django application, but after hosting it to app engine I cant do that.I really stuck with this problem, so please tell me if there is any solution for using django  email functions in Google app engine. 
I have tried  appengine_django  but it not working. 
Django version 1.3.1
python  version 2.6.5
Assistant: Google only allows you to send emails from a domain name that they control in the google app engine. So you will either have to send it from the test domain they give you, a gmail account, or you need to use their name servers for your domain name.
