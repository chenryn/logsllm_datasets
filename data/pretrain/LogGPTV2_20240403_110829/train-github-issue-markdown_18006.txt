In the meantime, using the above ideas here is what I came up with:
    import { withRouter } from 'next/router';
    export const withPageRouter = Component => {
      return withRouter(({ router, ...props }) => {
        router.query = [
          ...new URLSearchParams((router.asPath || '').split(/\?/)[1]).entries()
        ].reduce((q, [k, v]) => Object.assign(q, { [k]: v }), {});
        return ;
      });
    };

We should make sure (add a test) that client-side query strings are correctly
merged into statically exported pages post-hydration (for a normal and
dynamically routed page).
