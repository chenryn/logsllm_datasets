or more, depending on the number of patients from P in the
MBeacon.
The impact of noise gets even more pronounced if we
assume the researcher to submit only 1,000 queries. On the
unprotected methylation Beacon, the AUC is about the same,
however, the researcher cannot get good answers from an
SVT2-protected MBeacon. This shows the price of the SVT2
protection: more queries have to be submitted.
Threshold T = 3. Next, we increase the threshold. We keep
the same budget c and privacy level  since we just want to
study the inﬂuence of the increased threshold. Figure 4 shows
the result, we see an overall slight decrease in performance.
This decrease is even smaller with T = 2, which we do not
show here for space constraints. A threshold T > 3 would
probably not be accepted by researchers given this MBeacon
sizes, therefore, we did not experiment with higher thresholds.
Setting the Parameters. The above results demonstrate that

dependent on the use case to maximize utility and minimize the
privacy loss. We believe that our general method of parameter
tuning, namely, setting a budget c that is not exceeded, then
changing values of  based on attacker’s and researcher’s
performance and increasing c if needed by a higher noise level
(or reducing it if the consumed budget is much smaller), yields
a good trade-off between utility and privacy for any dataset and
MBeacon size.
IX. PROTOTYPE
We implement a fully functional prototype of our MBeacon
system, which can be accessed at https://mbeacon-network.
github.io/MBeacon-network/. Our prototype is built based
on the same algorithms used in our experiments. All our
implementation is done in Python, with packages including
Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy. We rely on Flask14 to build the
web frontend. This allows us to seamlessly integrate our
implementation into the backend, forming a centralized service
as part of our prototype.
The backend of our prototype is responsible to query the
datasets and to return the MBeacon output after SVT2 has been
applied. As an input, it takes a CpG identiﬁer as well as the
methylation value at this position to look for. Upon getting a
query, our MBeacon system will return all the institutions that
have the corresponding data.
In the future, we envision our prototype to be run in a
decentralized manner, so that every data provider runs their
own MBeacon service. In this scenario, the centralized service
is only required to provide the frontend.
X. RELATED WORK
Homer et al. [16] are among the ﬁrst to perform a mem-
bership inference attack on genomic data. In their attack,
summary statistics are used as the adversary’s background
knowledge and the L1 distance to measure the similarity
between summary and victim. Sankararaman et al. [32] further
improved Homer’s attack by incorporating the LR test
in
the algorithm. More recently, Backes et al. [5] have shown
that membership inference attacks can be also successfully
performed on epigenetic data, such as microRNA. Due to the
threat demonstrated by the attacks, sharing biomedical data
(or even summary statistics) has to take privacy into account
which often prolongs the process for researchers to get data.
In response, GA4GH established the Beacon system [10] to
facilitate genomic data sharing.
Attacks on Genomic Beacons. Shringarpure and Busta-
mante [36] showed that even only given binary responses, it
is possible to infer whether a patient is in a Beacon with the
LR test. Moreover, their attack’s probability estimation is not
dependent on the allele frequencies, but the more stable allele
distribution. While they studied the inﬂuence of several factors
(population structure, Beacon size and others) on the attack’s
effectiveness, they did not propose any feasible solutions to
establish a privacy-preserving genomic Beacon.
Raisaro et al. [29] extended the attack in [36] by adopting
a sophisticated selection strategy. The attacker in this setting
14http://ﬂask.pocoo.org/
has direct access to allele frequencies and selects the most
informative positions to query ﬁrst. This setup serves as a
blueprint for our attack against MBeacons.
The authors of [44] proposed an attack using the cor-
relations between different single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) to infer alleles that are missing or systematically
hidden. This attack drops the number of queries necessary to
infer membership with strong conﬁdence, and renders privacy-
preserving mechanisms based on hiding low-frequency SNPs
useless. However, for DNA methylation, such correlations are
not (yet) well studied. Therefore, we decide to postpone an
in-depth study about the inﬂuence of correlations between
methylation positions on the privacy risks to future work.
Privacy Protection for Beacons. Besides the attack, Raisaro et
al. [29] proposed three protection mechanisms and experimen-
tally showed their effectiveness even in their stronger attacker
setting. However, they do not provide any formal guarantees
on their protection mechanisms.
Wan et al. [45] further analyzed the protection mechanisms
presented in [29], and additionally proposed a new one. They
empirically evaluated utility, privacy and effectiveness of the
protection methods under several settings with respect to the
hyperparameters. Here, the corresponding utility, privacy and
effectiveness measures were proposed in the iDASH challenge
for genomic data.
Two additional privacy protection mechanisms are pro-
posed by Al Aziz et al. [1], one of which, the biased random-
ized response, is proven to be differentially private. Apart from
that, they analyzed both mathematically and experimentally
how the decision boundary for membership relates to the
number of queries and the number of patients in the Beacon.
To the best of our knowledge, the existing attacks are
all conducted on genomic Beacons, and we propose the ﬁrst
membership inference attack on Beacons with DNA methyla-
tion data. Moreover, by simulating legitimate and adversarial
behavior, we believe that our utility measures provide a more
realistic picture. It is worth noting that the privacy and utility
measures we propose in this paper are not limited to MBea-
cons, we leave their application on other types of biomedical
data as a future work.
XI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst Beacon system for shar-
ing DNA methylation data, namely, the MBeacon system. Due
to the severe privacy risks stemming from DNA methylation
data, our construction of MBeacon follows a privacy-by-design
approach.
We ﬁrst illustrate the severe privacy risks by conducting
a membership inference attack based on the LR test. Ex-
perimental results on multiple datasets show that with 100
queries, the adversary is able to achieve a superior perfor-
mance. Then, we propose a defense mechanism, SVT2, to
implement our privacy-preserving MBeacon. Our SVT2 is
an advancement of the sparse vector technique, one type of
differential privacy algorithms. We theoretically prove that
SVT2 is differentially private. Since the goal of MBeacon is to
facilitate biomedical data sharing, we propose a new metric for
measuring researchers’ utility considering a realistic scenario.
12
Extensive experiments demonstrate that, using carefully chosen
parameters, MBeacon can degrade the performance of the
membership inference attack signiﬁcantly without substantially
hurting the researchers’ utility.
There are two directions we want to explore in the future.
First, we plan to extend the Beacon-style system to other types
of biomedical data, such as gene expression, microRNA or
laboratory tests. In particular, this requires to adapt the estimate
of the general population accordingly. Second, the current
Beacon systems only support queries on a single position. We
plan to extend the Beacon system to support multiple-position
queries. On one hand, this new system should improve the
utility for the researchers. On the other hand, it will raise new
privacy challenges.
