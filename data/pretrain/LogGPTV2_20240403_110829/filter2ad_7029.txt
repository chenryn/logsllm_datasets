ABSTRACT
In ths paper, we present a new varant of dgtal sgnature scheme, 
restricted  message  signing.  Ths  sgnature  scheme  restrcts  a 
sgner such that he or she can sgn any message except for ones n 
the specfc message set. We expect t to be a useful prmtve for 
varous  cryptographc  applcatons.  We  propose 
frst 
constructon of the restrcted message sgnng and prove t secure 
n the random oracle model. 
Keywords: Dgtal sgnature, blnear map group. 
1. Restricted Message Signing 
the 
In  ,  Shamr  [S]  proposed  the  frst  dea  of  dentty-
based  cryptography,  and  presented  an  dentty-based  dgtal 
sgnature scheme. In 00, Boneh and Frankln [BF0] drected a 
spotlght on to t agan, and presented the frst practcal dentty-
based encrypton scheme (IBE) n random oracle model. In 00, 
Boneh and Boyen [BB0] presented the frst effcent and secure 
IBE  scheme  n  standard  model;  however  they  acheved  slghtly 
weakened  CCA  securty,  called  selectve-ID  securty.  We  are 
nspred  a  lot  by  the  technques  of  IBE  schemes,  and  present  a 
new varant of dgtal sgnature, restricted message signing. Ths 
sgnature  scheme  restrcts  a  sgner  such  that  he  or  she  can  sgn 
any  message  except  for  ones  n  the  specfc  message  set; 
meanwhle  there  s  no  excepton  n  standard  dgtal  sgnature 
scheme. It brngs a new concept to dgtal sgnature and we expect 
t to be a useful prmtve for varous cryptographc applcatons. 
We brefly descrbe our dea n the followng.  
There  are  three  players  n  ths  scheme,  a  key  dstrbuton 
authorty  (KDA),  a  restrcted  sgner,  and  a  verfer.  We  assume 
that KDA s a trusted thrd party. In setup phase, KDA generates 
some  parameters,  a  restrcted  sgnng  key  for  a  sgner  and  ts 
correspondng verfcaton key. KDA gves the parameters and ts 
certfcate  to  the  sgner  wth  the  restrcted  sgnng  key.  KDA 
publshes  the  verfcaton  key.  In  sgnng  phase,  the  sgner 
generates  a  sub-sgnature  by  the  restrcted  sgnng  key  and  sets 
the  tuple  of  the  sub-sgnature,  the  parameters  and  ts  certfcate 
gven  by  KDA  as  the  full  sgnature.  In  verfcaton  phase,  a 
verfer  verfes  the  certfcate  for  the  parameters  and  the  sub-
sgnature. She accepts f both of them are vald, otherwse rejects.

Clearly, we can easly derve a smple restrcted message sgnng 
from  a  standard  dgtal  sgnature  f  KDA  ssues  the  restrcted 
messages  as  publc  nformaton.  Snce  a  verfer  knows  the 
restrcted messages, she can reject all sgnatures for the restrcted 
messages. However,  
a restrcted sgnng key may be assgned by the qualfcaton 
of  the  sgner,  and  the  qualfcaton  may  depend  on  hghly 
senstve  nformaton  of  the  sgner;  fnancal  state,  physcal 
characterstc,  closed  regulaton,  etc.  In  ths  stuaton,  t  s  qute 
natural  that  the  sgner  would  keep  such  nformaton  secret; 
therefore  publc  nformaton  ssued  by  KDA  should  not  reveal 
whch  messages  are  restrcted.  Therefore  we  stpulate  not  only 
unforgeablty  for  sgnatures  but  also  prvacy  for  the  restrcted 
message set as a securty requrement. It needs an elaborate trck 
to  construct  a  restrcted  message  sgnng  scheme  preservng 
prvacy. The crux of the trck s the technque showed n [BB0]. 
In  that  paper,  they  constructed  an  IBE  scheme  and  proved  ts 
securty  by  reduction  to  absurdity.  That  s,  they  assumed  the 
presence of an adversary who broke ther IBE scheme wth non-
neglgble  probablty,  then  showed  that  they  could  construct  an 
adversary  who  broke  the  BDH  assumpton  wth  non-neglgble 
probablty. The BDH adversary has to smulate the challenge for 
the IBE adversary; therefore they constructed a smulator for the 
challenge.  We  apply  ther  smulator  to  construct  our  restrcted 
message sgnng scheme. 
In ths paper, we defne a restrcted message sgnng and two 
securty  requrements,  unforgeablty  and  prvacy.  Then  we 
propose  the  frst  constructon  of  the  restrcted  message  sgnng 
whch  works  on  the  blnear  map  groups.  We  show  that  our 
scheme  s  unforgeable  aganst  chosen  message  attacks  f  the 
computatonal  Dffe-Hellman  assumpton  holds  and  retans 
prvacy n nformaton theoretcal sense.
