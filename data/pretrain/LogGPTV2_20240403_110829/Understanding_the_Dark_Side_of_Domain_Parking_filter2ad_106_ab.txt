Table 1: Top 10 Parking services in our data set. The number
of monetization chains is not the same as the number of parked
domains since each parked domain was crawled multiple times
during our collection period. Note that parking services found
in this paper to carryout illicit activities are anonymized as

whole ecosystem. They include expired domains with
back links, blacklisted domains (e.g., exploit servers or
TDSes [17]) seized or taken down then repurchased by
domain owners or newly acquired domains. As illus-
trated in the ﬁgure, parked domains forward their traf-
ﬁc to parking services, which in turn select the most
proﬁtable monetization option in real time, based upon
a set of characteristics of the trafﬁc such as its geoloca-
tion, browser type and domain keywords. Occasionally,
a parking service chooses to forward the trafﬁc to another
parking service when the latter offers a higher return on
a speciﬁc trafﬁc instance. In addition, a parking service
may collaborate with trafﬁc monetization platforms (e.g.
Skenzo.com), which monetize different types of trafﬁc
such as parking trafﬁc, error trafﬁc (i.e. 404 not found
pages) and non-existent domains. Here, we refer to this
type of partnership as parking syndication.

Potential
illicit monetization activities.
In our
study, we discovered, during our crawling of parked
domains,
into
question the legitimacy of some monetization op-
erations.
Speciﬁcally, we found that some URLs
on the redirection chains initiated by our crawler
contain patterns related to the delivery of clicks,
for example, “http://fastonlinefinder.com/
ads-clicktrack/click/newjump1.do?”. The
problem is that our crawler never clicked on any URLs.
It just visited a parked domain and followed its (au-
tomatic) redirection chain (see Section 2.3). Also,
we observed a lot of “shady” search websites (e.g.,
fastonlinefinder.com), which look like search
engines but return low-quality ad results. Those search
sites are also observed in prior research [18, 4] and have
been presumed to be related to malicious activities like
click fraud and malware delivery.
However, conﬁrming the presence of illicit activities in
domain monetization is challenging. Take click fraud as
an example. We need to determine whether the crawler
trafﬁc has indeed been monetized as clicks, which can
only be conﬁrmed at the advertiser end. Further com-
plicating this attempt is the observation that some park-
ing services try to make the click delivery look like
zeroclick monetization (PPR) by bouncing the trafﬁc
through entities with indications of “zeroclick” in the
URL: for example, a visit to a parked domain is ini-
tially redirected to http://bodisparking.com/
tracking?method=zeroclickrequest before
moving to the click URL. Also, malware scanning can-
not ﬁnd any malicious payloads from the trafﬁc collected
from parked domains. Most importantly, given that the
trafﬁc for domain monetization goes down a complicated
redirection chain, including ad networks and parking-
service syndication, it becomes highly nontrivial to iden-
tify the party responsible for a malicious activity, even
when its presence has been conﬁrmed.
2.3 Overview of Our Study
Here we describe at a high level what we did in our re-
search to understand the suspicious activities that happen
within this domain parking ecosystem.
Data collection. As discussed above, the data used in
our study was collected from crawling parked domains.
For this purpose, we implemented a dynamic crawler as a
Firefox extension and deployed it to 29 Virtual Machines
(VMs). The crawler is designed to simulate a user’s visit
to a URL through a browser by rendering its content and
running scripts. All such content and HTTP trafﬁc (such
as redirections) generated are collected and dumped into
a database. In this way, the crawler is able to gather the
information produced by execution of dynamic content.
Those crawlers worked on a list of parked domains,
which was updated every 3 days during the past 5.5
months (August 1st, 2013 to January 20th, 2014). Those
domains were discovered by reverse-lookup for the NS
records of known parking services (a list built manually)
using the PassiveDNS set (DNS record collection) pro-
vided by the Security Information Exchange [30].
In
order to investigate the monetization activities through
those domains, we constructed a monetization chain for
each URL visit. A monetization chain is a sequence of
URL redirections (e.g. HTTP 302, iFrame tags, etc.) ob-
served during a visit to a parked domain, including ad
networks and trafﬁc systems related to monetizing the
visit.
During each visit, each crawler randomly picked one
of 48 user agent strings covering popular browsers, op-
erating systems and mobile devices. Overall, we made
about 24M visits to over 100K parked domains. From
all those visits, we identiﬁed 1.2M (5%) monetization
chains including redirections (not direct display of ads).

presented in Table 1.
Inﬁltration and expansion. To identify illicit activities
involved in the monetization of parked domains and un-
derstand the scope and magnitude of the problem, we
performed an inﬁltration study on the domain parking
ecosystem to gain an “insider” view about how those
parking systems operate. This is critical for overcom-
ing the barriers mentioned in Section 2.2. More specif-
ically, we ran our crawlers to collect data from parked
domains and also parked domains under our control with
major parking services. Additionally, we launched a few
ad campaigns and also purchased trafﬁc associated with
some keywords. By carefully selecting the parameters at
our discretion, we were able to “connect the dots”, link-
ing the start nodes (domains) or trafﬁc sources (crawlers)
under our control to our end nodes (ad or trafﬁc pur-
chase campaigns) on monetization chains. Those chains
(called seeds), together with the accounting information
we received from related parking services and ad net-
works, reveal the whole monetization process with re-
gard to our inputs. This enables us to identify the pres-
ence of click fraud, trafﬁc stealing (failing to report mon-
etized trafﬁc) and trafﬁc spam (low-quality trafﬁc). We
elaborate this research in Section 3.
To understand the impacts of those fraudulent activ-
ities, we extracted from the seed monetization chains a
set of ﬁngerprints, or stamps, to identify the monetiza-
tion method used. Once a monetization chain is identi-
ﬁed as either PPC or PPR, we infer the presence of illicit
activities. Our research shows that our approach accu-
rately identiﬁes illicit monetizations through known ad
networks and trafﬁc systems. Most importantly here, this
approach helps us expand those seeds to a large number
of monetization chains collected by our crawlers. Over
those chains, we performed a measurement study, which
shows the pervasiveness of the problems, their unique
features and the proﬁts the parking services get from the
illicit activities. The study and its outcomes is reported
in Section 4 and Section 5.
Adversary model. In our research, we consider that the
parking service is untrustworthy, capable of manipulat-
ing the input trafﬁc it receives and its accounting data to
maximize its proﬁts at other parties’ cost. It also cloaks
frequently to avoid being detected by third parties. On
the other hand, the service cannot change its interfaces
with legitimate ad networks: it needs to make the right
calls to deliver its trafﬁc to the networks. In the mean-
time, some less reputable ad networks (2nd-tier or lower)
may not be trustworthy either, which adds complexity to
assigning blame to different parties involved in a known
fraudulent activity.
In practice, parking services are actually legitimate
companies. What we found is that they apparently be-
have legitimately most of time but are indeed involved in
illicit operations occasionally. This adversary is actually
very unique, since they blur the lines between fraudulent
and legitimate transactions and conduct operations with
highly questionable practices.
3 Dark Side of Domain Parking
In this section, we report on our inﬁltration of the domain
parking ecosystem. As discussed before, what we did
is to control trafﬁc sources (crawlers), some start nodes
(parked domains) and some end nodes (ad campaigns
& trafﬁc purchases) of the ecosystem, to get end-to-end
monetization chains going through them, as depicted in
Figure 3. The ﬁgure shows that the chains are as follows:
from our parked domains to our end nodes, that is, adver-
tisers or trafﬁc buyers (in black); from other parked do-
mains to our end nodes (in red); from our parked domains
to other end nodes (in green) and from our crawlers but
not through our domains or end nodes (in blue). Among
those chains, the black and red chains connect our traf-
ﬁc source, crawler, to our end nodes through parked do-
mains, which are used as the ground truth for validating
our ﬁndings (Section 3.3) and the seeds for detecting il-
licit activities on other chains (Section 4).
Inﬁltrating End Nodes
Below we describe how we inﬁltrated the ad networks
and direct trafﬁc navigation systems on the end-node side
and the parking services on the start-node side.
3.1
Here we walk through our inﬁltration of the end nodes of
the ecosystem, which includes a few steps: we need to
identify the right targets (ad networks or trafﬁc systems),
register with them, launch ad campaigns and set the right
parameters to maximize the chances of receiving our own
crawling trafﬁc.
Target identiﬁcation and registration. To identify the
most popular targets, we inspected a sample dataset, in-
cluding monetization chains collected during the ﬁrst
two weeks of August 2013, to collect a set of the most
prevalent top and 2nd-tier ad networks and direct nav-
igation systems. This turned out to be rather straight-
forward for some targets (e.g., the Looksmart ad net-
work with a domain name looksmart.com), but not
so for others. For example, for some ad networks (e.g.
Advertise), only the domains of the “shady” search
websites they utilized showed up on their click URLs;
the “masters” of those search domains were not revealed
from their whois records, which indicated either an
anonymous registration or missing organization names.
To uncover those ad networks, what we did include us-
ing a domain’s Autonomous System Names (ASN) or
other domains sharing its IP addresses to determine its
afﬁliation, as well as comparing an ad network’s contact

information with that on the domain’s whois record.
Once a set of targets (ad networks and trafﬁc systems)
were identiﬁed, we attempted to register with them as
an advertiser or a trafﬁc buyer. This happened with fake
identities whenever possible, for the purpose of conceal-
ing our true identity to avoid cloaking activities, but we
had to use our real information for some of them, which
asked for IDs such as driver’s license and a credit card.
All together, we successfully afﬁliated ourselves with 15
out of 25 top ad networks and trafﬁc systems identiﬁed.
For those we failed to do so, the main cause was that they
only accepted large-budget customers.
Campaign creation and parameter tuning. We set up
a search-like website (Figure 7 in Appendix) and hosted
it on three domains, one for trafﬁc purchasing and the
other two for advertising. Using those domains, we cre-
ated both advertising and trafﬁc purchasing campaigns.
Speciﬁcally, for each of them; we selected 10 keywords
related to our own parked domains, and also constructed
our target URLs, given to the ad networks or trafﬁc sys-
tems, to communicate a set of data (e.g., ad network
names, publisher IDs, keyword used, etc.)
to be used
to identify monetization chains that end at our websites
through our crawlers. Table 2 summarizes our inﬁltration
meta-data.
For each campaign, we carefully adjusted its parame-
ters to maximize the chances of getting trafﬁc from our
own crawlers, which provided us with the end-to-end
monetization chains we were looking for. The strate-
gies for such parameter tuning varied across different
ad networks and trafﬁc systems. Speciﬁcally, some of
them offered geo-targeting, which we leveraged to aim
at the city our crawlers were located. When this was
not available, we tried to take advantage of other features
such as browser type and timing when offered. Particu-
larly, for the browser feature, our campaign opted to tar-
get the least common browser type, which our crawlers
also used for their user agents. Additionally, the timings
of some campaigns were tuned in a way that they only
ran when trafﬁc from sources other than our crawlers
was minimal, for example, from 12AM-6AM and 10PM-
12AM. As an example, the direct navigation trafﬁc sys-
