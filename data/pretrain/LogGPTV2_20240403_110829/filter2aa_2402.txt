SPA
• SPA is Single Packet Authentication, a single 
packet that can authenticate a user to a system
• It is a protocol for allowing a remote user to 
authenticate securely on a “closed” system 
(limited or no open services)
• Uses GPG to sign/encrypt a message to a 
sniffing server in a single TCP, UDP, or ICMP 
packet
• Work across NAT
• Free

NPC
• NPC is Nearly Perfect Crypto. Seriously….
• It includes a utility for creating large one time 
pads (using the PRNG ISAAC)
• Fast, simple and quick
• If you can manage the key exchange, it is nearly 
the most perfect and unbreakable crypto you can 
get (one time pads are considered the ultimate 
crypto)
– Key management is a bitch, and may render this 
impractical for modern humans
