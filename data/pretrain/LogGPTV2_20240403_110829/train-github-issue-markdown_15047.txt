I have various Link in my application but when deployed in production they
stop working. The code is as follows:
      Register
When navigating in development they work fine. When I deploy to production the
link takes forever to load the next page. If I write the URL in the address
bar it loads fine. When I click on the Link it just hangs, and never loads the
page.
Production environment is:
Ubuntu 18.04  
Node.js custom server (Express) behind Nginx.
