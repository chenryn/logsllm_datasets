#### Problem description: ".resample" documentation too vague
url: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-
docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html
e.g.:
**rule:** "The offset string or object representing target conversion"
No idea what is meant by that but a more helpful description to amateurs like
me seems to be e.g.:  
'a frequency or valid rule for re-sampling an inputted time-series object.
Expressed as a string. '
Where is the documentation on 'how'? Or is it deprecated. If so, why is it
there?
There are 13 parameters with only 9 descriptions.
Lastly, I think that if documentation is structured, a better suited layout is
in the form of tables with clear headers but I suppose the documentation is
too far in for anyone to be motivated to change it!
