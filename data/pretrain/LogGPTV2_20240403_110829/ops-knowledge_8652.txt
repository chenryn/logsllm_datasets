User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Wireless XP users don't get their home folder mapped We're using Windows XP and Active Directory, we have a number of laptops that have a excellent connection to the wireless network, the logon script runs and maps the required drives etc, all appears fine apart from the Home Folder isn't mapped, we rely on the home folder mapping to be done by AD when the user logs on we don't map this with the logon script. 

The problem is the home folder doesn't get mapped when using wireless, plug an ethernet cable in and the home folder is mapped. What could be causing this? Anyone and ideas?

Thanks

Assistant: It sounds like you don't have Wireless Zero Config setup to be able to authenticate before the user is completely logged in.  You need to have the machine able to connect to wireless without user interaction in order to authenticate against AD and now cached credentials as squillman said.
