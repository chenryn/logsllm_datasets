**Abstract:**
While the control and data planes of Internet video have been extensively studied, little attention has been given to the video management plane. This paper characterizes the video management plane and its evolution using data from over 100 video publishers over a two-year period. The management plane exhibits significant diversity in video packaging, playback device support, and Content Delivery Network (CDN) usage. Current trends suggest increasing diversity in these dimensions, which adds complexity to management tasks. We find that the complexity of many management tasks is sub-linearly correlated with the number of hours a publisher's content is viewed. Additionally, each publisher currently operates an independent management plane, leading to sub-optimal outcomes for syndicated content, such as redundancies in CDN storage and loss of control over delivery quality.

## 1. Introduction

Video traffic constitutes the majority of Internet traffic [29, 36, 39, 42]. This surge is driven by the popularity of large services like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook [20, 23, 35], as well as the significant increase in Internet video services provided by traditional broadcast television publishers [43].

An Internet video publisher must:
1. Split the video into chunks, encode each chunk at one or more bitrates, and encapsulate chunks using a streaming protocol.
2. Develop and maintain playback software for a wide range of user devices.
3. Distribute video to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

These tasks are referred to as video management plane operations, distinct from control plane operations (e.g., selecting CDNs and bitrates) and data plane operations (e.g., transporting chunks to end users). While the data and control planes have received much research attention (e.g., [47, 61, 65, 66, 71, 73, 76, 80]), the video management plane remains relatively unexplored, despite its impact on reach, computational and storage requirements, troubleshooting, application performance, and the integration of control plane innovations [65, 68, 71, 76, 80].

This paper characterizes aspects of the video management planes for over 100 content publishers, including 7 of the top 10 subscription video publishers [11], prominent sports and news broadcasters, and on-demand video publishers. Our dataset, from Conviva [9], includes metadata for over 100 billion video views, covering client, video, and delivery information. The aggregate daily view-hours across all publishers are comparable to those reported for Facebook and Netflix.

Our data is unique compared to published industry reports [11, 13, 41] because it spans 27 months, allowing for analysis of management plane practices over time and enabling us to assess view-hours and views for any data slice (e.g., mobile app usage).

**Contributions:**
1. **Characterization of Video Management Planes:** We analyze three key dimensions: streaming protocols, playback devices and platforms, and CDNs. For each dimension, we examine how instances (e.g., specific protocols, platform categories) have evolved across publishers and over time, and how this correlates with view-hours.
2. **Complexity Analysis:** We quantify the impact of diversity on the complexity of management plane operations such as software maintenance, failure triaging, and packaging overheads. We find that the complexity of these operations is sub-linearly correlated with view-hours.
3. **Syndication Implications:** We demonstrate that current management plane practices may not be well-suited for content syndication, leading to sub-optimal outcomes such as redundant CDN storage and loss of control over delivery quality.

## 2. The Video Management Plane

A video publisher makes live and/or stored video content available online. The content is encoded in different formats, delivered by one or more CDNs, and played back on various user devices. The video control and data planes together achieve chunked adaptive streaming, where the data plane streams video chunks over HTTP, and the control plane adaptively determines the bitrate and CDN based on network conditions.

### 2.1 Packaging
Packaging serves two purposes:
1. **Preparation for Adaptive Streaming:** Transcoding the master video file into multiple bitrates (e.g., H.264, H.265, VP9) and breaking it into chunks for adaptive streaming.
2. **Playback Information Generation:** Creating metadata necessary for end-user devices to perform playback, including available bitrates, audio bitrates, chunk durations, and URLs for fetching video chunks.

### 2.2 Device Playback
The management plane supports playback on a variety of devices, including:
- **Browser-based Players:** Implemented using JavaScript, HTML5, or external plugins like Flash or Silverlight.
- **App-based Playback:** For devices like streaming set-top boxes (e.g., Roku, AppleTV), game consoles, smart TVs, and mobile devices. Publishers use device-specific SDKs to build and maintain multiple versions of their apps.

### 2.3 Content Distribution
Publishers use CDNs to distribute content. Some, like YouTube and Netflix, deploy their own CDNs, while others use third-party CDNs. To improve performance and availability, some publishers use multiple CDNs and CDN brokers. Content is either proactively pushed to CDNs or packaged by the CDN on behalf of the publisher.

## 3. Goals, Methodology, and Dataset

**Goals:**
- Characterize, at scale, the video management plane practices of publishers with respect to packaging, CDN use, and device support.
- Analyze how these practices have evolved over time.
- Understand the implications of these findings on the complexity of video management and the performance of content delivery.

**Methodology:**
- **Data Collection:** Our dataset from Conviva [9] includes metadata for over 100 billion video views, covering client, video, and delivery information.
- **Analysis:** We analyze the data along three key dimensions: streaming protocols, playback devices and platforms, and CDNs. We also quantify the impact of diversity on the complexity of management plane operations and the implications for content syndication.

**Dataset:**
- **Sources:** Data from over 100 video publishers, including 7 of the top 10 subscription video publishers [11], prominent sports and news broadcasters, and on-demand video publishers.
- **Time Span:** 27 months, allowing for a longitudinal analysis of management plane practices.
- **Metrics:** View-hours and views, enabling detailed analysis of specific data slices (e.g., mobile app usage).

By providing a comprehensive characterization of the video management plane and its evolution, our study opens the door for further research into new syndication models, complexity metrics, and approaches to manage diversity and reduce management complexity.
