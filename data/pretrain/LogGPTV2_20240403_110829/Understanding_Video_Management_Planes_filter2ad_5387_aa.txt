ABSTRACT
While Internet video control and data planes have received much
research attention, little is known about the video management plane.
In this paper, using data from more than a hundred video publishers
spanning two years, we characterize the video management plane
and its evolution. The management plane shows significant diversity
with respect to video packaging, playback device support, and CDN
use, and current trends suggest increasing diversity in some of these
dimensions. This diversity adds complexity to management, and we
show that the complexity of many management tasks is sub-linearly
correlated with the number of hours a publisher’s content is viewed.
Moreover, today each publisher runs an independent management
plane, and this practice can lead to sub-optimal outcomes for syn-
dicated content, such as redundancies in CDN storage and loss of
control for content owners over delivery quality.

1 INTRODUCTION
Video forms the overwhelming majority of Internet traffic [29, 36, 39,
42]. The deluge in video traffic is due both to the popularity of large
services like YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook [20, 23, 35] and to the

significant increase in Internet video services provided by publishers
who traditionally produced content for broadcast television [43].
An Internet video publisher must (i) split the video into chunks,
encode each chunk at one or more bitrates, and encapsulate chunks
using a streaming protocol; (ii) develop and maintain playback
software for the wide range of user devices; and (iii) distribute
video to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). We refer to these tasks
as video management plane operations (§2), as distinct from con-
trol plane operations that involve selecting which CDN to direct a
user to and what bitrate to choose for each chunk, and data plane
operations that involves transporting each chunk to the end user.
Whereas the data and control planes have received much attention
(e.g., [47, 61, 65, 66, 71, 73, 76, 80]), video management plane de-
cisions have been relatively unexplored, even though they impact
how many users and devices a publisher can reach, the computation
and storage requirements of content publishers, the complexity of
troubleshooting, application performance, and the effort needed to
incorporate control plane innovations such as new bitrate selection
algorithms [65, 68, 71, 76, 80].
Our paper characterizes aspects of video management planes for
more than 100 content publishers (§3), including 7 of the top 10
subscription video publishers [11], as well as prominent sports and
news broadcasters and on-demand video publishers. Our dataset
comes from Conviva [9], which is a streaming TV measurement and
intelligence platform. The dataset contains metadata for over 100
billion video views, including metadata about the client (e.g., device
and application used), video (e.g., anonymous publisher ID and
video ID) and delivery (CDN, performance metrics). The aggregate
daily view-hours across all our publishers are comparable to reported
values for Facebook and Netflix.
Two aspects make our data unique relative to published industry
reports [11, 13, 41] (§7). Our data spans 27 months, enabling analy-
sis of management plane practices over time. It also lets us assess
view-hours (the total number of hours content is viewed) and views
(the total number of video sessions) for any slice of the data (e.g.,
how many view-hours or views can be attributed to mobile apps).
Contributions. First, we characterize video management planes
along three key dimensions (§4): streaming protocols, playback de-
vices and platforms, and CDNs. For each dimension, we characterize
(i) how each instance (e.g., a specific streaming protocol, or a spe-
cific platform category such as the set-top box) has evolved across
publishers, and over time; and (ii) the number of instances of each
dimension used by a given publisher and its evolution, and how this
correlates with the publisher’s view-hours.

Several common themes run across our analysis of these three
dimensions. We find that, despite significant changes over the 27
month period, no single dominant alternative has emerged along
any dimension. Among streaming protocols, HLS and DASH have
significant usage, while view-hours are almost evenly distributed
across 3 CDNs and across 2 platforms (browser and mobile). More-
over, more than 90% of view-hours can be attributed to publishers
who support more than 1 protocol. The same is true of publishers
who use more than 1 CDN, and publishers who support more than
1 platform. Publishers with more view-hours tend to support more
choices of protocols, platforms, and CDNs.
Beyond these, our analysis uncovers some new findings: stream-
ing set-top boxes1 dominate by view-hours; almost 80% of view-
hours are from publishers that support 4-5 CDNs; and a significant
fraction of publishers who use multiple CDNs segregate live and
on-demand traffic by CDN. Our analysis also adds color to known
findings. For example, DASH usage has increased, but this growth
is being driven entirely by large publishers. Moreover, while mobile
app views have indeed increased, view-hours have not proportionally
increased because view durations on mobile devices tend to be short.
Second, we take an initial step towards quantifying the impact
of three dimensions of diversity on the complexity of management
plane operations such as software maintenance, failure triaging, and
packaging overheads (§5). We find that metrics that approximate
the complexity of these operations for a publisher are sub-linearly
correlated with the publisher’s view-hours. For example, a publisher
with 10× as many view-hours as another will tend to maintain 1.8×
as many versions of its video playback software.
Third, we demonstrate that today’s management plane practices
may not be well suited for content syndication (§6), in which syndi-
cators license and redistribute content from a content owner. Syn-
dication is prevalent in Internet video, yet syndicators run video
management planes that are independent from those of content own-
ers. As a result, we find cases where, for the same content, owners’
clients observe significantly different delivery performance than
syndicators’ clients. We also find that more integrated management
planes between owners and syndicators can reduce CDN origin
storage requirements for a popular video series by 2×.
Our results further our understanding of video management planes
and open the door for research into new syndication models, com-
plexity metrics, and approaches to cope with diversity and reduce
management complexity.
2 THE VIDEO MANAGEMENT PLANE
A video publisher makes available online live and/or stored video
content. Video content is encoded in different formats, delivered
by one or more CDNs, and delivered to playback software on user
devices. The video control and data planes together achieve chunked
adaptive streaming: the data plane streams video chunks over HTTP,
and the control plane adaptively determines, based on network con-
ditions, which bitrate a chunk is downloaded at, and from which
CDN.
1Streaming set-top boxes are different from traditional cable set-top boxes. These
include devices such as Roku, FireTV, AppleTV etc. Throughout this paper we use the
term set-top box to refer to streaming set-top boxes.

Figure 1: A video delivery pipeline.
Each publisher operates a video management plane, a term we use
for a pipeline of automated systems (some with humans in the loop),
Fig. 1 shows one such pipeline, that perform two primary functions.
The first function prepares video content for delivery to users. Prepa-
ration involves packaging the video content and distributing content
to CDNs for delivery to users. The second function is to develop and
maintain playback software for the wide range of devices on which
video is consumed by users.2
Packaging. Packaging achieves two goals: 1) preparing content for
adaptive streaming and 2) generating the necessary information for
an end user device to perform playback.
Encoding. The first packaging step transcodes the master
video file into multiple bitrates of encodings such as H.264 [15],
H.265 [16] or VP9 [32]. A video bitrate encodes the video at a
certain resolution and a certain quality. A given resolution can
be encoded at different qualities, which differ in the degree of
lossy compression applied to trade-off perceptual quality for
reduced bandwidth. Publishers optionally use DRM (Digital
Rights Management) software to encrypt the video so that only
authenticated users can access it.3
Each encoded bitrate of the video is then broken into chunks
(a chunk is a fixed playback-duration portion of the video) for
adaptive streaming and encapsulated using a Streaming Protocol
(discussed below). Some publishers support byte-range addressing,
where clients can request an arbitrary byte range for a given bitrate
instead of chunks.
Streaming protocols. Streaming protocols define the encapsu-
lation format for video chunks to enable delivery over the net-
work. A number of streaming protocols are in use today includ-
ing Apple’s HLS [4], Microsoft’s SmoothStreaming (MSS [19]),
Adobe’s HDS [1] as well as an open standard MPEG-DASH pro-
tocol (DASH) [12]. Of these, Apple’s devices only support HLS,
though recent Apple devices allow limited support for DASH [40].
Some protocols like DASH [12] can support any video encoding
format, while others like HLS only support a fixed set of codecs [6].
Streaming protocols also specify metadata about the video neces-
sary for adaptation by the control plane. This metadata is stored in
a manifest file. The manifest contains information about a number
2Other management plane functions, including accounting, billing, and fault isola-
tion, are beyond the scope of the paper.

of attributes including the values of available bitrates for adaptation,
the audio bitrates, the time duration of an individual chunk and the
URLs to fetch video chunks etc.
Device Playback. The next function of the management plane is to
support the range of devices on which a user can view the publisher’s
content. To enable playback on them, publishers either provide Video
Players embedded in web pages to permit browser-based viewing or
Apps on devices that permit app-based content delivery.
Browser-based video players today are either implemented using
JavaScript inserted into webpages using native HTML5 support,
or using external plugins such as Flash or Microsoft’s Silverlight.
However, several types of devices such as streaming set-top boxes
(e.g. Roku, AppleTV), game consoles (e.g Xbox), smart TVs (e.g.
Samsung TV), and mobile devices use app-based playback. To build
these apps, publishers use device-specific SDKs (Software Devel-
opment Kits, sometimes called Application Frameworks) which
provide support for frame rendering, user controls etc. as well as
bitrate adaptation logic [48, 65, 68, 71, 76, 80]. Because publishers
may have to support different devices, and, for a given device, differ-
ent SDK versions (since users may take time to upgrade their device
SDKs), at any given time publishers may have to maintain several
versions of their app (one for each device-SDK version combina-
tion).
Content Distribution. Publishers employ Content Distribution Net-
works (CDNs). Some content publishers such as YouTube and Net-
flix deploy their own CDNs. The publishers in our dataset serve
their videos via third-party CDNs (though some also use private
CDNs). To improve performance and availability, some publishers
serve content through multiple CDNs [61, 66, 69]. Some publishers
use a CDN broker to select the best CDN for a given client view [72].
Even some publishers who only use a single CDN use a CDN broker
for management services such as monitoring and fault isolation.
Most publishers proactively push content to CDNs. A publisher
may either push packaged chunks to each of its CDNs, or may
use a packaging service provided by a CDN. In the latter case, the
publisher pushes the master video file (or live video stream), and the
CDN performs the packaging on behalf of the publisher. The client
playback software retrieves chunks using URLs in the manifest file.
3 GOALS, METHODOLOGY & DATASET
Goals. We want to characterize, at scale, publisher video manage-
ment plane practices (with respect to packaging, CDN use, and de-
vice support) and how they have evolved over time. We also present
preliminary analyses to understand the implications of these findings
on the complexity of video management, and the performance of
