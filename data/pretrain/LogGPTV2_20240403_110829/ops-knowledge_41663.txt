User: On Windows, I have installed Python 2.7 and added python.exe's directory to PATH. Then I installed pip und used pip install eyeD3 to install the eyeD3 module successfully. However, using import eyeD3 doesn't work, but throws an ImportError.
I had the idea to adjust the PYTHONPATH-environment-variable in my command line, but had no clue to what I would have to set it.
Assistant: The namespace changed to eyed3 in 0.7, as did the API. On all platforms.
