While migrating our app from 2.5.7 to 3.0.4 we have noticed a major slowdown
in the application context's startup.
Our application is using Spring Batch and has 22 batches. I have ran a
profiling session and noticed an _abusive_ call to
`java.lang.Class.getMethod(String, Class[])`.
The culprit seems to be a change in
`AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(Method,Class)`.
Attached the back trace calls for both Spring 2.5 and 3.0.4. The only thing
that changed between the profiling sessions is the Spring version and the
profiler only starts the (same) application context.
I also have the yourkit snapshots if you are interested to run a snapshot
comparison.
This is obviously blocking us to upgrade. Let me know if there anything I can
do to help.
