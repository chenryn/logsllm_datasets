it does not trigger control-plane reaction (e.g., BGP route
changes [5]) and it can easily evade route-change counter-
measures produced by online trafﬁc engineering. Finally,
unlike Coremelt, which targets the backbone routers of
an AS, Crossﬁre aims to select routers and links that are
distributed across ASs of different ISPs, such that no single
ISP could counter the attack. In short, the Crossﬁre attack is
different from Coremelt as it shares neither all the goals nor
the attack techniques of Coremelt. Table VII summarizes the
key differences between Crossﬁre and Coremelt.
C. Large-Scale Connectivity Attacks
The technical underpinnings of the Crossﬁre attack are
also related to research on the robustness of Internet con-
nectivity to attacks that disable routers or links [54, 55, 56].
Albert et al. [54] illustrate that if an adversary disables 4%
of the highly connected routers, the entire Internet would
break up into small isolated pieces. However, later work by
Magoni [55] and Wang et al. [56] concludes that all such
attacks would be infeasible because of the huge number of
routers or links that need to be disconnected.
The main distinction between the Crossﬁre attack and this
line of work is that our notion of (dis)connectivity captures
the practical realities of the Internet; we say that a node A
is (effectively) disconnected from a node B whenever the
persistent route from A to B is severely congested (viz.,
Section II-A2).
The Crossﬁre attack also has a clearly different goal from
the routing attack proposed by Bellovin and Gansner that
cuts multiple network links to attract a certain trafﬁc to
compromised routers for eavesdropping purposes [6].It is
also different from the DoS source-detection technique pro-
posed by Burch and Cheswick [57] whereby a victim server
attempts to ﬂood various routers and measure decreases in
attack trafﬁc – a telltale sign identifying attack sources on
the router’s path.
D. Brute-Force DDoS Attacks
The goals of the Crossﬁre attack are fundamentally dif-
ferent from those of conventional brute-force DDoS attacks
[1, 2, 29, 58] in at
it has a
ﬂexible choice of targets in a much more scalable range
three respects. First,

than those of DDoS attacks (e.g., from servers of a single
enterprise, to those of a state or country). Second, its attack
sources (i.e., bot hosts) are undetectable by any targeted
servers, since they do not receive attack messages, and
by network routers, since they receive only low-intensity,
individual ﬂows that are indistinguishable from legitimate
ﬂows. Third, its persistence against the same set of targets
can be extended virtually indeﬁnitely by changing attack
parameters. The Crossﬁre advantage of the ﬂexible choice
of targets in a geographic area is shared by the geo-targeted
DDoS attacks in cellular networks proposed by Traynor et al.
[59]. However, these attacks are less relevant for the Internet.
VIII. CONCLUSION
The proliferation of bot networks seems unavoidable, for
at least as many reasons as that of malware, the primary
reason being successful large-scale social engineering scams
against unsuspecting users world-wide. End-server bots
ﬂooding the Internet router fabric to effectively disconnect
other end-server systems is the penultimate insult to the end-
to-end argument in network design, the ultimate being, of
course, the loss of end-to-end trust caused by malware in
end-servers [60].
The question of whether it is possible to counter an attack
such as Crossﬁre arises naturally given the current Internet
architecture and ISP operations. Preliminary analysis sug-
gests that combinations of multiple countermeasures against
such attacks may, in fact, become necessary. As argued
in Section IV, no single ISP can counter such an attack
whenever the ﬂooded links reside in different ISP domains,
regardless of the quality of trafﬁc engineering techniques
employed by individual ISPs. Whether ISP coordination be-
comes practical despite of competitive concerns, remains to
be seen. Another possibility would be to support application
layer overlays that would route around ﬂooded links by
selecting different server routes in response to link-ﬂooding
alerts. Yet another possibility would be to deter massive
attacks by both preemptive and retaliatory disruption of bot
markets with certainty. This would require analysis of bot
markets along the lines of described by Caballero et al. [41].
Finally, international agreements regarding prosecution of
telecommunication-infrastructure attacks may also become
necessary [61].
