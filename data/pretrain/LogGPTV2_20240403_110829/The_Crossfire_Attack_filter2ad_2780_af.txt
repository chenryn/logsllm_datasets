### Indistinguishability at Routers and Undetectability at Target Area Servers

- **Indistinguishability at Routers**: The attack traffic is designed to be indistinguishable from legitimate traffic, making it difficult for routers to detect and block the malicious flows.
- **Undetectability at Target Area Servers**: The target servers do not receive direct attack messages, thus they are unable to detect the attack sources.
- **Reliance on Wanted Flows Only**: The attack relies solely on desired flows, provided that the bot-to-bot flow intensity does not exceed the router's capacity.

| Feature | Indistinguishability at Routers | Undetectability at Target Area Servers | Reliance on Wanted Flows Only |
|---------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Crossfire | Y                               | Y                                      | Y*                            |
| Coremelt | N                               | N/G                                    | N                             |

*Y* = Yes, *N* = No, *N/G* = Not a Design Goal

### Table VII: Crossfire vs. Coremelt [7] Differences

The Crossfire attack differs from the Coremelt attack in several key aspects:
- It does not trigger control-plane reactions (e.g., BGP route changes [5]) and can evade route-change countermeasures produced by online traffic engineering.
- Unlike Coremelt, which targets the backbone routers of an AS, Crossfire aims to select routers and links distributed across ASs of different ISPs, making it impossible for any single ISP to counter the attack.
- In summary, Crossfire shares neither all the goals nor the attack techniques of Coremelt.

### C. Large-Scale Connectivity Attacks

The technical underpinnings of the Crossfire attack are related to research on the robustness of Internet connectivity to attacks that disable routers or links [54, 55, 56]. Albert et al. [54] found that disabling 4% of highly connected routers could fragment the entire Internet into small isolated pieces. However, later work by Magoni [55] and Wang et al. [56] concluded that such attacks are infeasible due to the large number of routers or links that need to be disconnected.

**Key Distinction**:
- The Crossfire attack captures the practical realities of the Internet, defining (dis)connectivity as a situation where the persistent route between two nodes is severely congested (Section II-A2).

### D. Brute-Force DDoS Attacks

The goals of the Crossfire attack differ fundamentally from those of conventional brute-force DDoS attacks [1, 2, 29, 58] in three respects:
1. **Flexible Target Selection**: Crossfire offers a flexible choice of targets, ranging from servers of a single enterprise to those of a state or country.
2. **Undetectability**: Attack sources (bot hosts) are undetectable by targeted servers and network routers, as they receive only low-intensity, individual flows indistinguishable from legitimate traffic.
3. **Persistence**: The attack can be sustained indefinitely by changing attack parameters.

While the geo-targeted DDoS attacks in cellular networks proposed by Traynor et al. [59] share the advantage of flexible target selection, these attacks are less relevant to the Internet.

### VIII. Conclusion

The proliferation of bot networks is inevitable, driven by successful large-scale social engineering scams. End-server bots flooding the Internet router fabric effectively disconnect other end-server systems, undermining the end-to-end argument in network design and eroding end-to-end trust caused by malware in end-servers [60].

**Countermeasures**:
- Preliminary analysis suggests that multiple countermeasures may be necessary to counter attacks like Crossfire.
- No single ISP can counter the attack if the flooded links reside in different ISP domains.
- Potential solutions include:
  - ISP coordination despite competitive concerns.
  - Application layer overlays that route around flooded links.
  - Disruption of bot markets through preemptive and retaliatory measures.
  - International agreements for prosecuting telecommunication-infrastructure attacks.
