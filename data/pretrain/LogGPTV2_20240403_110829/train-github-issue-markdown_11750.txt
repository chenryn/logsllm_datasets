As you can see in the attached image, markdown syntax highlighter takes into
account the _ and * present in a code block. I think that it should ignore any
of these characters if they are within an indented code block.

No problem when I use fenced code blocks. But indented blocks are much easier.
I hope that this is the right place to report it.
