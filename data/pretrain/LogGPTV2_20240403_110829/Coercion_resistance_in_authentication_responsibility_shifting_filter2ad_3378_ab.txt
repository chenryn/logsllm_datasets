1. M walks into the room and asks Alice (in a slightly
rude manner) to leave the room. Alice then walks out.
2. M walks to Harry’s laptop, opens the password man-
ager of the web browser and starts writing down the
passwords on a piece of paper. M makes sure that
Harry observes what he is doing on the laptop.
3. In a short while, Alice returns and M acts like he is in
the situation of embarrassment (idiom: “caught with
pants down”). M immediately closes the password
manager.
4. Alice presses the button on her smartphone to lock
Harry’s laptop (without being noticed by Harry), and
then asks Harry to enter the password to unlock it
(without speaking out the password). All these take
place when M is in the room.
5. M behaves rudely while talking to Alice and subse-
quently leaves the room.
6. Alice explains to Harry that M is her classmate, and
inquires what M has done during her absence. No
matter whether Harry mentions the details or not, Al-
ice badmouths M, which further convinces Harry that
M is really a bad guy.
3.3.4 Phase IV. Coercing Harry
Aim — This is to capture Harry’s skin conductance re-
sponse when M coerces him to reveal Alice’s secret.
Procedure
3. After Alice leaves, M walks over to Harry’s computer
and starts guessing the password. After a few trials,
M verbally “coerces” Harry to reveal or enter the pass-
word. Sentences used by M include “I will complain
to my professor and he will take strict actions against
you”, “Don’t act smart, I know that you know the pass-
word”.
Toward the end of the user study, we explain to the par-
ticipants the real motivation of the study and provide a
questionnaire to ﬁnd out their experience during the whole
study. Note that Harry’s skin conductance is continuously
measured throughout the study.
4. EVALUATION
We present the results of the user study and our interpre-
tation of the results in this section. As discussed in Section 1,
there is a subtle yet important diﬀerence between the co-
ercion received by someone in a non-responsibility-shifting
scenario [3] and Harry in our user study. The diﬀerence
is whether the victim is coerced to reveal her own secret
(or the secret that protects her own valuables) or someone
else’s secret. Therefore, we ﬁrst analyze what participants
felt when they were being coerced to reveal Harry’s laptop’s
password. Building upon that, we then state our hypotheses
and based on approach proposed previously [3] we analyze
how many participants were actually nervous and stressed.
Here, we assume that Harry might be using such a system
to protect Alice’s secret he has, and evaluate the false-alarm
rate and miss rate of the system. After that, we analyze the
participants’ responses to the questionnaire to have a bet-
ter understanding of the collected skin conductance data.
The participants’ responses to the questionnaire are noted
on a 1–5 Likert scale: strongly agree ( ), somewhat agree
(G#), neutral (⊖), somewhat disagree (H#) and strongly dis-
agree (#). Finally we discuss the design and some of the
limitations of our user study.
4.1 Did Harry feel nervous and stressed?
We ﬁrst review the participants’ questionnaire responses
to check whether they felt nervous and stressed during the
coercion. According to the results obtained for our 29 par-
ticipants, 86% of the participants felt nervous and stressed,
and the rest feeling neutral. This has two important impli-
cations. First, our user study design is largely a success, in
the sense that we have achieved the goal of mimicking coer-
cion on the participants. Second, it seems that most people
do feel nervous and stressed even when coerced to reveal
someone else’s secret, which is the main question our user
study seeks to answer. Four out of the 29 participants did
reveal the password of Harry’s computer, whose comments
include the following when inquired.
• “I was intimidated and gave in the password”;
• “I was not comfortable when the bad guy was forcing
me to enter the password”;
• “It was not my password and data”;
1. M enters the room again and rudely demands that
Alice leave the room.
2. This time, Alice walks to Harry’s computer and man-
ually locks the screen before leaving the room.
• “Alice can always change her passwords later on”.
Comments from those who did not reveal the password
include “it is not ethical to give away someone else’s secret
information to other”, “it is not a good idea to get involved in
someone else’s personal conﬂicts”, “I was not sure of the kind
of personal data residing in the researcher’s (Alice) laptop”.
4.2 Was Harry really nervous and stressed?
Skin conductance has been shown in many previous stud-
ies to be a reliable indication of one’s emotional status [8]. If
participants actually feel nervous in a responsibility-shifting
scenario, we envision that one could build a coercion-resistant
system using skin conductance. To better understand the
extent to which such a system could be successful, we eval-
uate its accuracy in detecting coercions.
We ﬁrst state our two hypotheses that
• Hypothesis 1: The trustee whom the authentication
responsibility shifts to becomes nervous and stressed
upon a coercion attack;
• Hypothesis 2: What the participants have experi-
enced in the user study presented in Section 3 and
what the trustee would experience in a coercion attack
in the fourth-factor authentication follow the same dis-
tribution.
We simulate the execution of the system built upon a pre-
vious proposed coercion-resistant system [3] (see section 2.3)
and evaluate our two hypotheses stated with the skin con-
ductance data captured during our user study. We then
evaluate its accuracy in terms of false-alarm rates (a cor-
rect cryptographic key generated when Harry is coerced)
and miss rate (an incorrect key generated when Harry is
calm). We deﬁne a user as calm/nervous if the key gener-
ated during authentication does/does not match against the
key generated during enrollment.
The system is trained with 10 out of 26 SC samples (ran-
domly chosen with a duration of 10 seconds) captured during
Phase II (when Harry is calm, see Section 3.3), and is tested
with the remaining 16 SC samples in Phase II (to calculate
the miss rate) as well as all SC samples in Phase IV (to cal-
culate the false-alarm rate). Figure 2 shows the results with
three diﬀerent settings of k (k is used to tolerate some er-
rors in the skin conductance response) and several diﬀerent
settings of tSC (tSC is a threshold value); see Section 2.3 for
details.

Figure 2: False-alarm and Miss rate
We observe relatively low false-alarm and miss rates of
our system built under our hypotheses. For example, when
k = 1.25 and tSC = 3.1, we obtained a false-alarm rate
of 3.1% and a miss rate of 1.7%, which are comparable to
those originally obtained in a non-responsibility-shifting sce-
nario [3] (false-alarm rate of 3.2% to 3.1% and miss rate of
2.2% to 1.7%). This, in general, shows that Harry was ner-
vous and stressed when coerced to reveal Alice’s secret, and
the combination of our two hypotheses are good explana-
tions to the data observed during the user study. We also
found from the skin conductance of those 4 participants who
revealed the password of Alice’s laptop during coercion were
all nervous and stressed.
A closer look at Figure 2 shows that the false-alarm rates
are higher than the miss rates. One possible explanation to
this is that some participants were not nervous for the whole
period of Phase IV of the user study. The “coercion” applied
to Harry in our user study is not as severe as a real-world
coercion attack, which leads to inaccuracy in our hypothesis
2 and an increase to the false-alarm rate.
4.3 Personal v/s someone else’s secret
In this subsection, we focus speciﬁcally on Hypothesis 1
to see how the diﬀerence between being coerced to reveal
one’s personal secret and being coerced to reveal someone
else’s secret could have aﬀected its validity. Note that this
is also part of the main question we aim to answer.
We have presented to every participant the following two
statements and asked for their responses. Results are shown
in Table 1.
S-1. In the real world, you feel nervous when being coerced
to reveal someone else’s secret information (e.g., email
account password).
S-2. In the real world, you feel nervous when being coerced
to reveal your own secret information (e.g. email ac-
count password).

Table 1: Nervous when being coerced to reveal se-
cret information?
From Table 1, we notice that the number of participants
above the diagonal (highlighted) are higher (those feeling
more nervous when revealing their own secret) as compared
to that below the diagonal (those who feel more nervous
when revealing someone else’s secret). The result seems to
follow common sense, although this does not necessarily pre-
clude the possibility of designing a coercion-resistant system
for either case since the change of skin conductance may still
be large enough to be captured. To get an idea of this point,
we perform some simple analysis on the skin conductance
captured in this study and that captured in another one [3].
We found that in our user study the change in the SC data is
actually higher (µ=5.18, σ=2.58) as compared to (µ=1.86,
σ=1.28).
We warn readers from drawing more than what it deserves
from such a simple analysis. First, the two studies are quite
diﬀerent, and a direct comparison of the skin conductance
captured does not have a strong basis. Second, although
veal others’ secret, which can be captured by their involun-
tary skin conductance changes. We envision that this change
could be used to develop coercion-resistant systems for re-
sponsibility shifting in authentication.

changes in skin conductance have been shown to be a reli-
able indicator of emotional status [8], it has not been shown
that the value of skin conductance reﬂects the extent to
which the user feels nervous. That said, we believe that our
simple analysis could be viewed as an evidence that skin
conductance does change when they are coerced to perform
involuntarily, regardless the ownership of the secret.
4.4 Limitations of our user study
There are two main limitations of our user study. First,
Alice is played by a female member of our research team
in our user study. Since people in general show compassion
towards female gender, our results could be biased. Sec-
ondly, as the user study is an act, many unforeseen events
did take place. The actual scenarios were not always consis-
tent throughout the user study across diﬀerent participants.
5. RELATED WORK
In this section we review some of the techniques which in-
volve implicit/explicit responsibility shifting and some pre-
vious work on emotion recognition. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this paper is the ﬁrst work on stress detection under
the context of responsibility shifting. As explained in Sec-
tion 1, an explicit responsibility shift occurs when a user fails
to reproduce her credential where an implicit shift occurs in
case when there is some suspicious activity in the account
etc. In both cases the entity to which the responsibility is
shifted can be either “human” or a “computer system”.
There have been many proposals on explicit shifting of re-
sponsibility when the user fails to generate her credentials.
Alternate email addresses can be used to reset the password
of the primary email-id in the case of password loss [10].
Other backup authentication mechanism includes personal
knowledge based questions [6, 5], preference based backup
authentication mechanism [4], and the fourth factor authen-
tication [1]. Facebook has added a security feature similar to
fourth-factor authentication where a user can recover his ac-
count by collecting the codes from 3 of his trusted friends [2].
Authentication schemes involving responsibility shifting are
always vulnerable to coercion attacks as long as the trustee
is a human being.
Recently Twitter (using implicit responsibility shifting)
automatically revoked access to those third party apps abus-
ing its APIs for users tweet collection [9]. This is also an ex-
ample of implicit responsibility shifting whereby the respon-
sibility is shifted to a computer system checking whether the
number of API calls are exceeding the limit or not.
Skin conductance is an emotional response parameter and
is associated with a wide variety of feelings, thoughts and be-
havior. Researchers have linked skin conductance response
to stress and autonomic nervous system arousal [8]. There
are many techniques proposed for emotion recognition, among
which Gupta et al. [3] proposed the ﬁrst and comprehensive
approach to use skin conductance as an emotion recognition
parameter to ﬁght against coercion attack, though it is not
for responsibility shifting.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we study the security of human-trustee based
authentication responsibility shifting, in particular, under
coercion attacks. Our intensive user study shows that most
trustees demonstrate nervousness when being forced to re-
