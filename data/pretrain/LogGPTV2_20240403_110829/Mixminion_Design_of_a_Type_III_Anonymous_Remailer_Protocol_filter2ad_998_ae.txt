listed destinations and expired keys, should mit-
igate this attack. Again, imposing a deadline on
transmission at each hop may help more [11].
(cid:15) Sign somebody else up as a mix. Signatures
on capability blocks prevent others from forging
blocks to the directory servers.
(cid:15) Flood the directories with nonfunctional mix en-
tries; run highly reliable mixes to gain trafﬁc for
analysis; attack honest mixes to encourage users
to start using the dishonest ones. Availability and
reliability statistics should mitigate some of these
problems, but they introduce problems of their
own. They are an area of active research [11, 12].
10. Future Directions and Open Problems
This design document represents the ﬁrst step in peer re-
view of the Type III remailer protocol. Many of the ideas,
ranging from the core design to peripheral design choices,
need more attention:
(cid:15) We need more research on batching strategies that re-
sist blending attacks [36] as well as intersection at-
tacks on asynchronous free routes [6].
In particular
the anonymity they provide during normal operation
or under attack must be balanced with other properties
such as latency and reliability.
(cid:15) We need a more thorough investigation of multiple-
message tagging attacks and an analysis of how to
safely choose paths when sending many messages.
When a message to be sent is larger than the Mixmin-
ion payload size, we need a strategy to fragment it and
(cid:15) Can we keep the indistinguishability of forward mes-
sages and replies using a simpler design? We need
to prove that our design provides bit-wise unlinkabil-
ity between the input bit-patterns of messages and the
messages coming out of the network.
(cid:15) Currently, reply messages can be distinguished from
plaintext forward messages at the exit nodes: the for-
mer exit as encrypted data, and the latter do not. We
prevent further partitioning by arranging encrypted
forward messages to blend in with the reply messages,
but even this degree of distinguishability is unsettling.
Finding further means to mitigate this problem would
be helpful.
(cid:15) A synchronous batching approach, where messages
have deadlines for each hop, may allow easier
anonymity analysis, and may provide much larger
anonymity sets because all messages entering the mix-
net in a given time interval are mixed together. A
cascade is the simplest example of this approach, but
we should consider mechanisms for free-route syn-
chronous mixes. We could greatly improve our protec-
tion against message delaying attacks and the partition-
ing attacks discussed in Section 5.4. On the other hand,
the costs are greater network synchronization and over-
head, and less mix operator ﬂexibility.
(cid:15) We need stronger intuition about how to use dummy
messages. Such messages can be inserted between
nodes as link padding, or as actual multi-hop Mixmin-
ion messages. We must develop a more analytically
justiﬁed approach to determine which parties send
dummy messages, how many they send, and when they
send them.
While many people have speculated about the ben-
eﬁts of dummy trafﬁc, we have not yet seen any con-
vincing analysis. For this reason, while Mixminion is
ﬂexible enough to support them, we plan to leave dum-
mies out of the design (other than their minimal use in
Section 8.1) until their effects on anonymity are better
understood.
We have working code which implements most of the de-
signs described in this paper, with acceptable performance
even using 2048 bit RSA keys (800KB of messages per sec-
ond on a 1GHz Athlon). We invite interested developers
to join the mixminion-dev mailing list and examine the
more detailed Mixminion speciﬁcation [24].

This paper incorporates ideas from the Mixmaster de-
velopment team, particularly Len Sassaman, Scott Renfro,
Peter Palfrader, Ulf M¨oller, Lance Cottrell, and Bram Co-
hen, to improve the Type II remailer protocol; their effort
was abandoned in favor of Mixminion.

Mazi`eres, Peter Palfrader, Len Sassaman, Andrei Serjantov,
Robyn Wagner, and Bryce “Zooko” Wilcox-O’Hearn pro-
vided helpful design discussions, editing, and suggestions.
We further thank all the unnamed cypherpunks out there
who have worked on remailer issues for the past decades.
