### Describe the issue with documentation
**Apache Version** : 2.2.3
**OS** :macOS Catalina Version 10.15.7
**Apache Airflow Provider versions** :
**Deployment** :
**Web browser** : Google Chrome Version 98.0.4758.80 (Official Build) (x86_64)  
Also happened with Safari Version 13.1.3 (15609.4.1)

I marked in red the parts of the tutorial that can't be seen on the website.
There are probably more missing details.
Thanks in advance!
