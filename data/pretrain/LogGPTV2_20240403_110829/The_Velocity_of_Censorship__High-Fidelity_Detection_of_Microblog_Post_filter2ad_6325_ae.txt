the linear composition of the independent components,
s, X can be modeled as:
X = AS =
m
(cid:31)i=1
aisi
A, the mixing matrix, gives the coefﬁcients for linear
combinations of the independent signals, the rows of S.
Here, each word is represented by a row vector of
length 864 (36× 24), which contains the 36 days worth
of hourly frequency from 22 July 2012 to 2 Septem-
ber 2012. The 50 × 864 matrix X is fed to an ICA
program [25]. The number of independent components
number is set to 5, which retains almost 100% of the
eigenvalues.
There are six words that appear in almost every inde-
pendent signal: Beijing, government, China, country, po-
liceman, and people. This means that the sensitive user
group in our user timeline has these general themes that
cut across the many individual topics that they discuss,
which may explain why their posts are often subject to
censorship.
6 Discussion
Weibo appears to have a variety of other mechanisms that
do not ﬁt neatly into our hypotheses, but which are in-
teresting to discuss. We ﬁrst consider other aspects of
Weibo’s ﬁltering, then we look at diurnal (time-of-day)
censorship behaviors, and ﬁnally we try to synthesize
some of our observations.
6.1 Weibo’s ﬁltering mechanisms
Sina Weibo has a complex variety of censorship mech-
anisms, including both proactive and retroactive mecha-
nisms. Here we summarize the mechanisms Weibo may
apply. Proactive mechanisms, as we discussed in Hy-
pothesis 1, may include: explicit ﬁltering, implicit ﬁl-
tering, and camouﬂaged posts. Retroactive mechanisms
for removing content that has already been released may
include:
• Backwards reposts search: In our deleted posts
dataset over 82% of reposted posts have a standard
deviation of less than 5 minutes for deletion time,
meaning that a sensitive post is detected and then
most of the other posts in a chain of reposts are then
deleted (Hypothesis 3).
• Backwards keyword search: We also observed
that Weibo sometimes removes posts retroactively
in a way that causes spikes in the deletion rate of a
particular keyword within a short amount of time.
Here, we give two examples (兲朝 and 37人), out
of many that we witnessed, with a strong spike in
the deletion of posts containing that keyword.
We ﬁrst consider 兲朝, Tian Chao, a neologism
for “Celestial Empire” where 兲 is an alternate
form for 天;
the substitute character is visually
similar to the original and also appears to be
constructed from the two distinct characters 王
八 ，meaning “bastard.”). The frequency of 兲
朝 in deleted posts, day by day, is the sequence
(6,3,0,0,2,2,0,3,0,2,3,3,2,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,4,4,2,14,3,6,4)
respectively from 28 July 2012 to 25 August 2012.
There is a concentrated deletion (14 censorship
events) of posts with this word within several
minutes on 22 August 2012, impacting posts that
were several weeks old at the time. It is likely that
a censor discovered this new phrase and ordered it
globally expunged.
Another example is the keyword 37人 (37 people).
There are 44 posts containing this keyword, which
were created from 2 days to 5 days before the cen-
sorship event, all removed together within 5 minutes
(03:25 to 03:30 27 July 2012). Those 44 posts are
from different users, have no common parent posts,
and have no common pictures. The only plausible
explanation for this concentrated deletion would ap-
pear to be a keyword-based deletion. The deletion
time at 3:25am Beijing time also strongly suggests
that there are moderators working in the early morn-
ing. To understand this workforce and its distributed
nature, we perform further analysis in Section 6.2.
• Monitoring speciﬁc users: Hypothesis 2 shows a
clear preference for Weibo’s censors to pay more at-
tention to users who seemingly like to discuss cen-
sored topics.
• Account closures: Weibo also closes users’ ac-
counts. There were over 300 user accounts closed
by the system from our sensitive user group (out
of over 3,500 users) during the roughly two month
period while when we collected data for their user
timelines.
• Search ﬁltering: To prevent users from ﬁnding sen-
sitive information on weibo.com, Weibo also has a
frequently updated list of words [4] which cannot
be searched.
• Public timeline ﬁltering: We believe that sensitive
topics are ﬁltered out of the public timeline. This
236  22nd USENIX Security Symposium 
USENIX Association
ﬁltering appears to be limited to only general topics
that have been known to be sensitive for a relatively
long time. In this paper all major results are based
on the user timeline, we only use the public time-
line for general results about major trending topics
in Weibo.
• User credit points: In May 2012, Sina Weibo an-
nounced a “user credit” points system [22] through
which users can report sensitive or rumor-based
posts to the administrators. We do not know the
extent to which the point system interacts with the
censorship mechanisms that we have already de-
scribed. It is possible that these reports “bubble up”
and help Weibo tune its automated ﬁlters, but we
have no way to observe this.
6.2 Time-of-day behavior
In our data, the time at which the censors are working and
deleting posts correlates more with the usage patterns of
regular users than with a typical day-time work schedule
(e.g., 8am to 5pm Beijing time). Figure 4 shows the to-
tal hourly deletions for different kinds of posts (on a log
scale) from 20 July to 8 September 2012. Both “general
deletions” and “system deletions” happen even very late
at night.

Hour
Figure 4: Post deletion amounts over 24 hours.
So do the censors respond as quickly during the night
as during day hours? We plotted the median lifetime of
the posts as a function of their deletion time in Figure 5.
The morning-hour spike suggests that the censors are be-
hind in the morning, both catching up on overnight posts
and dealing with a fresh inﬂux of posts from morning
risers. They catch up by late morning or early afternoon.

Figure 5: Post lifetime vs. deletion time of the day.
From Figure 4 and Figure 5 it is clear that, while a
signiﬁcant fraction of the censors seem to work during
regular work hours, many do not.
6.3 Synthesis
Based on everything we have seen and observed, we
can begin to understand how Weibo censorship works.
Clearly, they are using a strong degree of automation to
help them delete posts that have been declared sensitive.
It is also clear that this process is relatively “loose,” in
the sense that there are few sharp rules that deﬁne what
gets deleted vs. what is allowed to remain. Given the
long-tailed distribution that we observe in post lifetimes
prior to censorship, it is clear that some posts are not
considered a high priority for censorship, such as if two
friends start conversing with each other using a new ne-
ologism, euphemism, or other coinage that would other-
wise be censorship-worthy. However, when those new
terms spread and grow, they are censored both proac-
tively and retroactively.
This suggests that Weibo is trying to strike a balance
between satisfying the legal requirements within which
it operates and the costs of running a ﬁne-grained in-
strument of political censorship. Weibo must conduct
just enough censorship to satisfy government regulations
without being so intrusive as to discourage users from us-
ing their service. Among other issues, they must surely
be deeply concerned with false positives. If truly innocu-
USENIX Association  
22nd USENIX Security Symposium  237
ous posts disappeared with any regularity, Weibo’s users
might defect to a competing service.
It is unclear the extent to which Weibo is using natu-
ral language processing (NLP) algorithms to aid in their
work, versus having a stable of censors watching for
things to go viral and then using search tools to stamp
them out. Certainly, our use of fairly simple NLP tech-
niques helped reduce the workload of analyzing trend-
ing topics, so comparable techniques may well be in
use by Weibo. NLP techniques in a censor’s hands can
be thought of as a “force multiplier,” but it is unclear
whether they fundamentally change the game. Consider,
with English-language spam emails, the degree to which
spammers will try to evade automated spam classiﬁca-
tion systems. These techniques and more could well
be applied to automated or manual rewriting of post-
ings, with the intent of avoiding automated censorship.
The results might not be as easy to read, but humans
will likely have an advantage at reading jumbled text,
at least until NLP algorithms are extended to deal with
them. Conversely, NLP techniques can cluster together
related terms, assisting censors to overcome such tech-
niques. At least so far, we have not seen evidence of
any sort of arms race between increasingly sophisticated
ways to avoid censorship and increasingly powerful cen-
sorship techniques.
In many ways, Internet censorship is related to intru-
sion detection. When our results in this paper are com-
pared to related work (see Section 1), including both IP-
layer ﬁltering and application-level censorship, a picture
of Internet censorship in China emerges where “defense-
in-depth” is taken to a new level.
Intrusion detection
research has long focused on issues such as false pos-
itive vs.
false negative tradeoffs, viral spreading pat-
terns, polymorphic content, and the distinction between
different layers of abstraction (such as IP packets vs.
application-layer data). The so-called “Great Firewall of
China” and the accompanying application-layer censor-
ship that China’s domestic web services, such as Weibo,
carry out afford us an opportunity to study a real, national
scale intrusion detection system.
6.4 Major caveats
The most important caveat to keep in mind when inter-
preting our results is that we collected posts from a very
speciﬁc core set of users, built up from a “seed” group of
users who post about sensitive topics, which we call the
“user timeline.” Unless otherwise noted, such as when
results are from the public timeline, all results in this
paper are from the user timeline and therefore might be
biased by the differences between this core set of users
and the average Weibo user. All deletion rates, dele-
tion times, etc. must be interpreted in this light. In other
words, our sample users should not be considered to be
representative of the general population of Weibo.
Another important caveat is that our system does not
detect post deletions in the user timeline if the post
deleted is not one of the 50 most recent posts by the user
(see Section 3). This may affect our results about the
distribution of post deletions over time in Section 4.
7 Conclusion
Our research found that deletions happen most heavily in
the ﬁrst hour after a post has been made (see Figure 1).
Especially for original posts that are not reposts, most
deletions occur within 30 minutes, accounting for 30%
of the total deletions of such posts. Nearly 90% of the
deletions of such posts happen within the ﬁrst 24 hours
of the post.
With respect to the hypotheses enumerated in Sec-
tion 4, we make the following conclusions:
• Hypothesis 1: The Weibo system keeps more than
one keyword list, where each list triggers a different
kind of censorship behavior.
• Hypothesis 2: The clear downward trend in Figure 2
could be evidence that certain users are ﬂagged for
closer scrutiny, but we have not ruled out other
causes in this paper.
• Hypothesis 3: Figure 3 shows that over 82% of re-
posted posts have a standard deviation of less than
5 minutes deletion time, meaning that a sensitive
post is detected and then most of the other posts in
a chain of reposts are then deleted.
• Hypothesis 4: As described in Section 4, us-
ing the methods described in Section 5 we ﬁnd
that topics that were trends in the user timeline
and were also, according to the public timeline,
hot topics in public discussion as a whole about
events that happened during our month of data
collection (Qidong, Qian Yunhui, Beijing Rain-
storms, Diaoyu islands, and a group sex scandal)
had very short lifetimes. Recall that the deleted
posts in the user timeline included themes related
to state power (Beijing, government, China,
country, policeman, and people). This sug-
gests that such broadly discussed topics are tar-
geted with more censorship resources to limit cer-
tain kinds of discussion about the events.
Future work may reveal many mechanisms beyond
those we described here, and many different strategies
that Weibo uses to prioritize what content to delete. Our
238  22nd USENIX Security Symposium 
USENIX Association
results suggest that Weibo employs a distributed, hetero-
geneous strategy for censorship that has a great amount
of “defense-in-depth.”
One aspect of censorship that is not considered in our
analysis, but would be an interesting topic for future
work, is the interactions between social media and tra-
ditional media. Leskovec et al. [17] gives an interesting
analysis of the interplay between blogs and traditional
media during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. Tradi-
tional media relevant to Weibo may include the state-run
media that is heavily censored, or off-shore news out-
lets that are uncensored but limited in availability and
sometimes offset from China’s news cycles by timezone
differences.
