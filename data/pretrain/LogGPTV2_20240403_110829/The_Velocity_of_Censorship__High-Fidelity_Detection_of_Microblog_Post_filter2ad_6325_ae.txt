### Linear Composition of Independent Components

The linear composition of the independent components, \( s \), can be modeled as:
\[ X = AS = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i s_i \]
where \( A \) is the mixing matrix that provides the coefficients for the linear combinations of the independent signals, represented by the rows of \( S \).

In this context, each word is represented by a row vector of length 864 (36 days × 24 hours), containing hourly frequency data from July 22, 2012, to September 2, 2012. The 50 × 864 matrix \( X \) is fed into an ICA (Independent Component Analysis) program [25]. The number of independent components is set to 5, which retains almost 100% of the eigenvalues.

### Key Words in Independent Signals

Six words appear in almost every independent signal: Beijing, government, China, country, policeman, and people. This indicates that the sensitive user group in our dataset has these general themes across various individual topics, which may explain why their posts are often subject to censorship.

### Discussion

Weibo employs a variety of mechanisms for content filtering that do not neatly fit into our initial hypotheses but are worth discussing. We first consider other aspects of Weibo's filtering, then examine diurnal (time-of-day) censorship behaviors, and finally synthesize some of our observations.

#### Weibo’s Filtering Mechanisms

Sina Weibo uses a complex array of censorship mechanisms, including both proactive and retroactive measures. Here, we summarize the potential mechanisms:

**Proactive Mechanisms:**
- **Explicit Filtering:** Directly blocking certain keywords or content.
- **Implicit Filtering:** Subtly discouraging or limiting the visibility of sensitive content.
- **Camouflaged Posts:** Allowing posts with sensitive content to be posted but making them less visible or accessible.

**Retroactive Mechanisms:**
- **Backwards Reposts Search:** In our dataset, over 82% of reposted posts have a deletion time standard deviation of less than 5 minutes, indicating that once a sensitive post is detected, most related reposts are deleted (Hypothesis 3).
- **Backwards Keyword Search:** We observed that Weibo sometimes removes posts retroactively, causing spikes in the deletion rate of specific keywords within a short period. For example, the keyword 兲朝 (Tian Chao, a neologism for "Celestial Empire") and 37人 (37 people) showed significant spikes in deletions.

**Other Mechanisms:**
- **Monitoring Specific Users:** Censors pay more attention to users who frequently discuss censored topics (Hypothesis 2).
- **Account Closures:** Over 300 user accounts were closed from our sensitive user group during the data collection period.
- **Search Filtering:** Weibo maintains a frequently updated list of words that cannot be searched.
- **Public Timeline Filtering:** Sensitive topics are filtered out of the public timeline, though this appears limited to generally known sensitive topics.
- **User Credit Points:** Sina Weibo introduced a "user credit" points system in May 2012, allowing users to report sensitive or rumor-based posts. The extent to which this system interacts with other censorship mechanisms is unclear.

#### Time-of-Day Behavior

Our data shows that the times at which censors are active and deleting posts correlate more with regular user activity patterns than with a typical 8am to 5pm work schedule. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the total hourly deletions and the median lifetime of posts, respectively, indicating that censors are active even late at night and catch up on overnight posts in the morning.

#### Synthesis

Based on our observations, it is clear that Weibo uses a high degree of automation to delete posts deemed sensitive. The process is relatively flexible, with no strict rules defining what gets deleted. Some posts, especially those using new neologisms or euphemisms, may not be immediately censored. However, when such terms spread, they are censored both proactively and retroactively.

This suggests that Weibo is trying to balance legal requirements and the costs of running a fine-grained political censorship system. They must conduct enough censorship to satisfy regulations without being so intrusive as to discourage users. The use of NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms to aid in censorship is possible, but the extent of their use is unclear.

#### Major Caveats

- Our results are based on a specific core set of users who post about sensitive topics, which may not be representative of the general Weibo population.
- Our system does not detect deletions if the post is not one of the 50 most recent posts by the user, which may affect the distribution of post deletions over time.

### Conclusion

Our research found that deletions occur most heavily in the first hour after a post is made, with nearly 90% of deletions happening within the first 24 hours. We conclude that:
- **Hypothesis 1:** Weibo uses multiple keyword lists, each triggering different censorship behaviors.
- **Hypothesis 2:** There is a downward trend in Figure 2, suggesting certain users are flagged for closer scrutiny.
- **Hypothesis 3:** Over 82% of reposted posts have a deletion time standard deviation of less than 5 minutes, indicating chain deletions.
- **Hypothesis 4:** Broadly discussed topics, such as state power-related themes, are targeted with more censorship resources.

Future work may reveal additional mechanisms and strategies used by Weibo to prioritize content for deletion. Our results suggest a distributed, heterogeneous strategy for censorship with a strong defense-in-depth approach.
