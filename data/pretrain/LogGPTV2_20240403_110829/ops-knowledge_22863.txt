User: I tried using date command to change the system time in debian linux:
os.system("echo passwd | "sudo date -s \"Thu Aug  9 21:31:26 UTC 2012\")
and I set the python file permission to 777 and also chown as root. But it does not work and says date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted. Any Ideas?
Thanks
Assistant: You did a lower case -s it is meant to be -S so that is why it isn't working.
