### Analysis of Bitcoin Transaction Sizes and Spending Patterns

To begin, we examined the size of transactions, specifically the number of bitcoins sent in each transaction. Figure 2 illustrates the changing percentage of various transaction sizes over time. Unsurprisingly, until approximately April 2010—during the first 15 months of Bitcoin's deployment—almost all transactions involved exactly 50 bitcoins (the initial reward for mining a block). These transactions became a minority only in January 2011. This activity reflects the early adoption phase of Bitcoin, where most blocks contained only the coin generation transaction.

In later phases, the mining reward is slightly more than 50 bitcoins due to the inclusion of miner fees. Therefore, we created a separate bin for values between 50 and 55 bitcoins. We also observed a second turning point in early 2012, where the percentage of transactions carrying less than one bitcoin doubled abruptly (from 20% to 40%), while the percentage of transactions carrying less than 0.1 BTC tripled.

### Analysis of Bitcoin Spending Patterns

We also analyzed how quickly bitcoins were spent once they were received. Figure 3 shows this breakdown in terms of both public keys (how many recipient public keys spent their contents within a certain time window) and value (how many of the received bitcoins were spent within a certain time window).

From this figure, we again see two clear turning points. The first, in early 2011, marks the point at which users began meaningfully spending bitcoins rather than just "hoarding" them. From this point on, a negligible fraction of bitcoins are hoarded. However, these early hoarders took most of the bitcoins out of circulation. As observed by Ron and Shamir [18], a significant majority of all bitcoins are in "sink" addresses that have never spent their contents (75% at the time of their analysis, compared to our observation of 64%). This means only about 4 million bitcoins are currently in circulation. Nevertheless, the remaining coins are circulating quite actively, as seen in the second turning point in Figure 3: in April 2012, the percentage of bitcoins being spent immediately (i.e., in the same block in which they were received) doubled. More generally, half of all bitcoins are now spent within an hour of being received, and 80% are spent within a day.

### Impact of Services on Bitcoin Usage

As it turns out, and as we will discuss in Section 5.1, both recent trends of smaller transactions and faster spending can be largely attributed to a single service: the gambling site Satoshi Dice. Thus, even a longitudinal study of the Bitcoin network already highlights the significant impact that services have on current Bitcoin usage.

### Data Collection

To identify public keys belonging to the types of services mentioned in Section 2.2, we sought to "tag" as many addresses as possible; i.e., label an address as being definitively controlled by a known real-world user (e.g., Mt. Gox or Instawallet). By clustering addresses based on evidence of shared control, we can bootstrap off the minimal ground truth data to tag entire clusters of addresses as also belonging to that user.

Our primary method for tagging users was by transacting with them (e.g., depositing into and withdrawing bitcoins from Mt. Gox) and then observing the addresses they used. Additionally, we collected known (or assumed) addresses from various forums and websites, although we regarded this latter kind of tagging as less reliable than our own observed data.

#### Transactions with Various Services

We engaged in 344 transactions with a wide variety of services, listed in Table 1, including mining pools, wallet services, bank exchanges, non-bank exchanges, vendors, gambling sites, and miscellaneous services.

- **Mining Pools:** We attempted to mine with each of the major mining pools. Using an AMD Radeon HD 7970 capable of approximately 530 million SHA-256 computations per second, we triggered payouts of at least 0.1 BTC with 11 different pools, anywhere from 1 to 25 times. For each payout transaction, we labeled the input public keys as belonging to the pool. One pool, Eligius, split the coins among miners immediately, preventing us from tagging any of their public keys.
  
- **Wallets:** We kept money with most of the major wallet services (10 in total) and made multiple deposit and withdrawal transactions for each. Three of these services—My Wallet, Easycoin, and Strongcoin—kept the funds of their users separate, making it difficult to link many addresses together.

- **Bank Exchanges:** Most real-time trading exchanges (where the exchange rate is not fixed) also function as banks. We tagged these services by depositing into and withdrawing from our accounts, though rarely participating in actual currency exchange. We kept accounts with 18 such exchanges.

- **Non-Bank Exchanges:** In contrast, most fixed-rate exchanges did not function as banks and were intended for one-time conversions. We participated in fewer transactions with these exchanges but tried to transact with most of the major ones at least once (8 in total).

- **Vendors:** We purchased goods, both physical and digital, from a wide variety of vendors. Some vendors, such as Bitmit and CoinDL, function more as marketplaces. Many vendors relied on the BitPay payment gateway, and we also kept a wallet with Silk Road, allowing us to tag their public keys without making purchases. Figure 4 depicts all of our physical purchases.

- **Gambling:** We kept accounts with five poker sites and transacted with eight sites offering mini-games and lotteries. Many dice games (Satoshi Dice, BTC Dice, etc.) advertised their public keys, so we did fewer transactions with these services.

- **Miscellaneous:** Four of the additional services we interacted with were mix or laundry services. When provided with an output address, they promised to send coins with no association to the ones sent to them. One service, BitMix, simply stole our money, while Bitcoin Laundry twice sent us our own coins back, indicating we might have been their only customer at the time. We also interacted with Bit Visitor, a site that paid users to visit certain sites; Bitcoin Advertisers, which provided online advertising; CoinAd, which gave out free bitcoins; and Coinapult, which forwarded bitcoins to an email address.

### Account Clustering Heuristics

In this section, we present two heuristics for linking addresses controlled by the same user, with the goal of collapsing the many public keys seen in the blockchain into larger entities.

- **First Heuristic:** We treat different public keys used as inputs to a transaction as being controlled by the same user. This heuristic has been used in previous work and exploits an inherent property of the Bitcoin protocol.

- **Second Heuristic:** This new heuristic is based on so-called change addresses. Unlike the first, it exploits a current idiom of use in the Bitcoin network rather than an inherent property. It is less robust in the face of changing patterns but provides insight into the current Bitcoin network that the first heuristic does not.

#### Defining Account Control

Before presenting our heuristics, we clarify what the results of our clustering algorithms imply. Specifically, we define what we mean by address control. The controller of an address is the entity (or in exceptional cases, multiple entities) expected to participate in transactions involving that address. While this implies that the controller knows the corresponding private key, knowledge of the private key is not a sufficient requirement for control. For example, when buying physical bitcoins from a vendor like Casascius, the vendor, the buyer, and a service like Mt. Gox may all know the private key, but the controller is the entity expected to form transactions on behalf of that address.

Finally, we emphasize that our definition of address control is distinct from account ownership. For example, we consider a wallet service such as Instawallet to be the controller of each of the addresses it generates, even though the funds in these addresses are owned by a wide variety of distinct users.

#### Graph Structure and Definitions

To define our heuristics formally, we consider two important directed graph structures for the Bitcoin network: a transaction graph and a public key graph. In the transaction graph, vertices represent transactions, and a directed edge from a transaction \( t_1 \) to a transaction \( t_2 \) indicates that an output of \( t_1 \) was used as an input in \( t_2 \). Using this graph, we define in-degrees and out-degrees for transactions, which correspond exactly to the number of edges incident to and from the node, respectively.

**Definition 4.1.** The in-degree for a transaction \( t \), denoted by \( \text{indeg}(t) \), is the number of edges pointing to \( t \). The out-degree for a transaction \( t \), denoted by \( \text{outdeg}(t) \), is the number of edges originating from \( t \).
