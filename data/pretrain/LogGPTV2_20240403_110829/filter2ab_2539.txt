**ATT&CK ID:** G0114  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Chimera

**Description:**
Chimera has been observed to exfiltrate data from victims' email accounts. One of the methods used involves executing the following command:

```shell
wmic /node:<target_node> process call create "cmd /c copy c:\Users\<username>\backup.pst c:\windows\temp\backup.pst"
```

Additionally, Chimera copies files from the `My Documents` directory using a similar method:

```shell
copy "i:\My Documents\<filename>.pst" <destination_path>
```

These commands are designed to gather and transfer sensitive email data, such as `.pst` files, to a temporary location or another destination for further exfiltration.
