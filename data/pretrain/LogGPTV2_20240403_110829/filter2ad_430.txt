### Abstract
NETI@home is an open-source software package designed to collect network performance statistics from end-user systems. It has been developed and tested on Windows, Solaris, and Linux operating systems, with support for other platforms in progress. The tool runs on end-user machines, gathering various Internet performance metrics, which are then transmitted to a server at Georgia Tech and made publicly available. This approach provides researchers with valuable data on the end-to-end performance of the Internet as experienced by end-users. NETI@home uses packet sniffing to infer performance metrics, and users can select a privacy level to control the types of data collected. The software is designed to be unobtrusive, running quietly in the background with minimal user intervention and resource usage.

### 1. Introduction
The need for passive collection of end-to-end Internet performance measurements has been widely recognized [1][2]. Active measurement techniques have limitations, as they can inject significant traffic and may not provide accurate results [3][4]. Other passive collection methods often rely on limited collection points or require expensive and restrictive nodes [1][5]. Additionally, while some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) collect such data, they are generally reluctant to share it, and their methods vary significantly [1].

NETI@home addresses these issues by passively gathering performance metrics and making them available to researchers while respecting user privacy. This paper aims to introduce NETI@home to the research community and encourage more users to install the software, thereby increasing the volume of collected data.

### 2. Software Description
NETI@home is written in C++ and built on top of the open-source Ethereal [6] software package, a well-regarded network protocol analyzer. If Ethereal is unsuitable, alternatives like tcpdump [7] or custom solutions using the pcap library [8] can be used. The sniffer captures packets in real-time with minimal impact on the user's system, and only packets sent to and received by the user's system are analyzed. Users can set a privacy level that determines which data is collected; at the highest setting, no IP addresses are recorded, while at the lowest, all IP addresses are logged.

Once a specified number of packets are analyzed, the data is compressed and sent to a server at Georgia Tech via TCP. A duplicate copy is stored locally, and users can view the transmitted data using the included NETILogParse program. The collected data is placed in a publicly accessible database, allowing researchers to sort and analyze it through a web interface.

To encourage user participation, NETI@home includes a Java-based visualization tool that maps remote IP addresses to a graphical world display, showing the geographical location of each remote host using the NetGeo [10] database from CAIDA.

### 3. Network Statistics
NETI@home collects a wide range of statistics in accordance with CAIDA specifications [9], with plans to add more in future releases. The following are some of the key statistics gathered:

#### 3.1 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Source and Destination IP Addresses (recorded based on privacy settings)
- Source and Destination Ports
- Connection Establishment and Closure Times
- Number of Bad Checksums (IP and TCP)
- Number of Packets and Bytes Sent and Received
- Number of Acknowledgment, Duplicate, and Triple Duplicate Acknowledgment Packets
- Number of URG, PUSH, ECNECHO, and CWR Flags
- Sender and Receiver SACK Permitted
- Sender and Receiver Window Sizes (Minimum, Average, Maximum)
- Sender and Receiver TTL Values (Minimum, Maximum)
- Number of Packet Retransmissions and Bytes Retransmitted
- Number of Inactivity Periods
- Round Trip Time (Minimum, Maximum, Average)
- Number of Packets Received In-Order and Out-of-Order
- Number of Fragmented Packets and Don’t Fragment Flags
- Sender and Receiver Maximum Segment Size (if specified)
- Number of Rejected Connection Requests
- Flow Idle, Reset, and FIN Closure Status

#### 3.2 User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Source and Destination IP Addresses (recorded based on privacy settings)
- Source and Destination Ports
- Number of Bad Checksums (IP and UDP)
- Number of Packets and Bytes Sent and Received
- Average, Minimum, and Maximum Packet Sizes
- Number of Fragmented Packets and Don’t Fragment Flags
- Time of the First and Last Packets

#### 3.3 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Source and Destination IP Addresses (recorded based on privacy settings)
- Number of Bad Checksums (IP and ICMP)
- Number of Fragmented Packets and Don’t Fragment Flags
- ICMP Type and Code

#### 3.4 Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
- Source and Destination IP Addresses (recorded based on privacy settings)
- Multicast IP Address
- Number of Bad Checksums (IP and IGMP)
- IGMP Version and Type
- Number of Packets and Bytes Sent and Received
- Number of Fragmented Packets and Don’t Fragment Flags
- Maximum Response Time
- Time of the First and Last Packets

#### 3.5 Miscellaneous
- NETI@home Version
- Operating System
- Send and Arrival Times (to accommodate timing discrepancies)

### 4. Distributing NETI@home
Our goal is to deploy NETI@home in academic computer labs and on end-user systems across the country. As the user base grows, the value of the collected data increases. NETI@home is currently available for Linux and Solaris (in RPM and tarball formats) and for Windows (as a self-installing executable). Distributions for other platforms, including Macintosh, are in development. All distributions are available from our website: http://neti.sourceforge.net/. Users must also install the Ethereal network analyzer [6], available from http://www.ethereal.com/.

As an open-source project under the GNU General Public License (GPL) [12], the source code is freely available, ensuring transparency and trust. Users can inspect the code and suggest improvements.

### 5. Future Work
Future enhancements to NETI@home will include:
- Collecting the size of the TCP congestion window to monitor the congestion control algorithm.
- Measuring available bandwidth for end users.
- Adding support for additional transport-layer protocols.
- Collecting traceroutes to selected destinations, with options for full, trimmed, or no recording based on privacy settings.
- Enhancing the online database and performing detailed analysis on the collected data.

### 6. Conclusions
NETI@home is a powerful tool for collecting and analyzing end-to-end network performance metrics. It offers an unobtrusive, privacy-respecting solution that benefits both researchers and end-users. We encourage widespread adoption to enhance the global understanding of Internet performance.
