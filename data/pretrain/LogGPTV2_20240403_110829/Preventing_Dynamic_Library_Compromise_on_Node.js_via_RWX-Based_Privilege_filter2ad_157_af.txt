Session 6B: Web Vulnerabilities CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1836Tab. 8: This table contains vulnerable libraries on which we did not apply Mir and the reason why. Within a 5-hour human-effort timeout per
library, 7 libraries could not be exploited and 6 libraries could not be installed; 33 libraries fall outside Mir’s threat model; and 23 libraries
were made for a different language or platform.
