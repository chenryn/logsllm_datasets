### Session 6B: Web Vulnerabilities
**CCS '21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea**

This table contains vulnerable libraries on which we did not apply Mir and the reason why. Within a 5-hour human-effort timeout per library, 7 libraries could not be exploited and 6 libraries could not be installed; 33 libraries fall outside Mir’s threat model; and 23 libraries were made for a different language or platform.
