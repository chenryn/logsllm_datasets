User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SSL & Ngnix: no "ssl_certificate" is defined in server listening on SSL port while SSL handshaking I have managed to create my certificates with LE with not errors, I have also managed to redirect my traffic from port 80 to port 443. But when i reload my nginx server I am unable to access my website. The Ngnix error logs show this line:

4 no "ssl_certificate" is defined in server listening on SSL port while SSL handshaking, client: 192.168.0.104, server: 0.0.0.0:443


I think this means that it can't find the certificates I then navigated to the path of the certificates and they are both there, what could be the problem ?
Here is how my Ngnix configuration looks like:

server {
       listen         80;
       server_name    pumaportal.com www.pumaportal.com;
       return         301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;

    server_name pumaportal.com www.pumaportal.com;

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000";

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/pumaportal.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/pumaportal.com/privkey.pem;

    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/sub.log combined;

    location /.well-known {
       alias /[MY PATH]/.well-known;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:2000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    }

}


It all seems pretty straight forward I don't understand where could the problem be.

After running nginx -t it all seems ok:

nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

Assistant: My guess is that you have another server listening on port 443. 
This server has no ssl_certificate defined, and it's automatically selected (SNI).
Try to delete all symbolic links from /etc/nginx/sites-enabled except this one server you want to make work (if that's possible, otherwise check all of your servers for listening to 443 without being configured correctly).
