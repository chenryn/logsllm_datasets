### Address Space and ASN Vulnerabilities

Approximately 93% of the address space assigned to the accounts in our dataset can be compromised using advanced attack methodologies. Even with less sophisticated methods, such as FragDNS and SadDNS, which do not require control over a BGP router, adversaries can still take over 59% of the address space. Similarly, 74% of the Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) are associated with accounts that can be hijacked via any of the DNS cache poisoning attacks discussed in Section 4, while 30% can be hijacked specifically through SadDNS or FragDNS. The discrepancy between the vulnerability levels for IP addresses and ASNs is due to the fact that a significant portion of the IPv4 address space is owned by a small number of Autonomous Systems (ASes). For example, 21% of the assigned IPv4 address space is attributed to the top 10 Local Internet Registry (LIR) accounts.

### Domain Resource Vulnerabilities

Using our domain-to-account mapping, we identified user accounts at registrars, covering 11% of the accounts for which we were able to extract customer information. We believe this sample is representative of the vulnerabilities present across the top 1 million Alexa domains, as the vulnerabilities primarily depend on the nameservers of the customers' domains. Our study shows that 65% of the domains could be hijacked via any of the HijackDNS, SadDNS, or FragDNS attacks, while 35% could be hijacked via SadDNS or FragDNS alone.

### Table 6: Vulnerable Resources Mapped to Accounts in Our Dataset

| Attack Method | IP Addresses | Domains |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| HijackDNS     | 81%          | 65%     |
| SadDNS        | 47%          | 51%     |
| FragDNS       | 30%          | 27%     |
| Any           | 93%          | 35%     |

### Countermeasures

#### DNS Layer
- **DNSSEC Signing and Validation**: Deploy DNSSEC to prevent DNS cache poisoning.
- **Disable/Patch ICMP Rate-Limit**: Disable or patch ICMP rate-limiting to mitigate certain types of attacks.
- **Disable NS Rate-Limit**: Disable nameserver rate-limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Disable PMTUD**: Disable Path MTU Discovery to prevent fragmentation attacks.
- **Blocking Fragments**: Block fragmented packets to prevent specific types of attacks.
- **MTA-STS [RFC8461]**: Implement MTA-STS to secure email transmission.
- **Resolver Hardening**: Harden DNS resolvers to resist various attacks.
- **Non-predictable IPID Increment**: Use non-predictable IPID increments to prevent certain types of attacks.

#### IP Layer
- **IP-level Account Access Restrictions**: Restrict account access to specific static IP addresses.
- **Separate Systems**: Use separate systems for high-privileged users and low-privileged users.
- **Out-of-band Notifications**: Send out-of-band notifications for critical changes.
- **Request Rate-Limiting**: Implement request rate-limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Captchas**: Deploy captchas to deter automated attacks.
- **Hide Public Account Details**: Mask public account details to reduce the risk of targeted attacks.

#### General
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2-FA)**: Enable 2-FA with out-of-band notifications for web portal logins.
- **Email Address Masking**: Mask email addresses in WHOIS records.
- **Web Portal Security**: Implement security measures for web portals, including 2-FA and IP restrictions.

### Recommendations for Countermeasures

The primary issue highlighted by our attacks is the ease with which adversaries can manipulate Internet resources. Since these resources form the foundation of the stability and security of democratic societies, there is a need to revise current practices and develop more robust security measures. For example, the sale of Internet blocks should not be immediate and should require more than just a scanned document over email, which is easily faked. In addition to the standard recommendations for hardening DNS caches and blocking ICMP error messages, we provide the following best practices for providers and customers:

#### Separate Systems for High-Privileged Users
Currently, most providers allow any user to create an account, which can be used for managing Internet resources (high-privileged) as well as for registering for events or mailing lists (low-privileged). Low-privileged accounts have access to the same infrastructure (email servers, DNS resolvers, etc.) as high-privileged accounts, enabling adversaries to open low-privileged accounts and use them to gather information about the provider's infrastructure. Providers should use separate user management systems and a separate set of servers for users who own digital resources versus those who are registered for mailing lists or events.

#### Two-Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication (2-FA) systems must be enabled by default. The two authentication factors must be independent, and an attacker should not be able to compromise both within a single attack. This rules out email-based 2-FA for password recovery, which is currently available at some providers.

#### Email Address Masking
Email addresses in WHOIS records should be masked. Some domain registrars already follow this practice.

#### Account-Level IP Address Access Restrictions
Registrars should restrict account access to only a few static IP addresses belonging to the domain's owner.

#### Deploy DNSSEC
DNSSEC ([RFC4033] to [RFC4035]) would make the attack methodologies in Section 4 practically impossible. Unfortunately, only 3.78% of RIR customer domains and 5.88% of registrar customer domains are correctly signed. For instance, out of 1,832 LIR domains under AFRINIC, only 58 are signed, and 27 of these domains are still vulnerable because DNS resolvers cannot establish a chain of trust from the root anchor. Additionally, 12 use weak cryptographic keys (below 512 bits), and 12 use weak (vulnerable) hash functions. The remaining 95 domains out of the 1,832 were not responsive. Even when a domain is signed and the resolver validates DNSSEC, human factors can still introduce vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Therefore, we recommend that providers and customers deploy additional measures to harden their infrastructure.

### Conclusions

Each provider maintains a database defining which customer owns which Internet resources and offers tools for customers to manage these resources. Our research shows that these databases are poorly protected, allowing adversaries to take over accounts and manipulate the databases, causing immediate changes to the customers' resources. Our attacks used different DNS cache poisoning methodologies, demonstrating that even with weak off-path adversaries, these attacks are practical and can be applied against a large fraction of resource providers. Our results highlight the feasibility of such attacks, even with limited capabilities. Certainly, accounts associated with Internet resources are attractive targets for stronger Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) adversaries, such as cybercriminal groups or nation-state attackers.

We described countermeasures for mitigating off-path attacks on customer accounts. Addressing the fundamental problem of easy manipulation of Internet resources requires creating policies, revising the Internet management infrastructure, and developing techniques to secure transactions over Internet resources.
