cost  is  of  the  same  order  as  the  marking  process:  O  (∆2).
In  our  scheme  the  value  of  pri  (p)  of  each  node  p  is 
recalculated  every  two  rounds,  that  is,  once  in  2Tgossip.  In 
the inward phase, the direction of an edge is from a node 
that  should  transmit  its  gossip  message  earlier  (i.e.,  has 
lower priority) to a node that should do that later (i.e., has 
a higher priority) according to the above description. After 
that,  G  becomes  a  directional  graph  with  some  transient 
hierarchical  structure.  Figure  2  gives  an  illustration  of 
applying the above rules. The edge directions of Figure 2 
(a)  for  the  inward  phase  are  shown  in  Figure  2  (b).  For 
each node p, the values of mw (p) and gw (p) are shown in 
Figure 2 (c). 
The 
two-phase  scheme 
is  simple  and  easy 
to 
implement.  Each  gossip  message  is  associated  with  the 
sender  identifier  and  the  current  round  number.  All  the 
nodes initially operate in the inward phase, and the nodes 
with no inward edges transmit their gossip messages first. 
After  that,  if  a  node  receives  the  entire  gossip  messages 
from  the  opposite  nodes  of  its  inward  edges  and  each 
gossip  message  is  associated  with  the  current  round 
number,  it  transmits  its  gossip  message.  For  example,  in 
Figure  2,  p5  transmits  its  gossip  message  upon  reception 
of  the  gossip  messages  from  p6  and  p7.  To  further 
differentiate the timing of gossip message transmissions, a 
predetermined  delay  based  on  identifier  can  by  applied. 
However,  we  do  not  investigate  how  to  resolve  the 
collisions  and  contention  occurring  at  the  MAC  layer  in 
this  paper.  After  Tgossip  has  passed,  the  outward  phase 
begins  and  the  round  number  is  incremented.  In  the 
outward phase, all the edge directions are reversed and the 
same  actions  are  taken  according  to  the  new  directions. 
Each  mobile  host  transmits  its  gossip  message  once  in 
each phase, that is, every Tgossip. In our system model, the 
gossip messages may be lost or a node may wait for some 
gossip  message  too  long  to  transmit  its  gossip  message 
within a round. We use a timeout mechanism to avoid this 
problem.  Each  member  keeps  a  timer,  and  the  timeout 
period is set behind the idea of generating longer relaying 
paths. Therefore, in the inward phase the node with higher 
priorities  should  have  longer  timeout  periods.  For  each 
node  p,  its  inward  phase  timeout  period TOinward (p)  is 
assigned by this formula:

where max_gw = max {gw (u) | u ∈ V}. This value can be 
disseminated by asking each node p to attach the value of 
gw  (p)  to  every  message  it  transmits,  and  max_gw  is  the 
maximum  value  it  has  gotten  yet,  max_gw  is  updated 
whenever  a  larger  value  is  known  by  receiving  a  new 
message.  Clearly,  this  value  may  become  obsolete  and 
inaccurate due to topology changes. We assume that each 
message  is  associated  with  a  timestamp  and  each  node 
ignores  this  attached  value  if  a  received  message  was 
transmitted too long ago. We believe that the impact of an 
inaccurate max_gw is slight under reasonable mobile host 
speed and round period through simulations. The outward 
phase  timeout  period  of  node  p TOoutward  (p)  is  simply 
Tgossip  -  TOinward  (p).  The  two-phase  scheme  is  effective 
based  on  our  definition.  Obviously,  any  round-based 
scheme  with  each  member 
transmitting 
its  gossip 
messages at least once in a round is effective. 
6.3. Heuristics to Improve the Performance 
It  can  be observed  that  in  the  resultant  directional  graphs 
by  applying  the  proposed  rules,  some  nodes  have  inward 
edges  only  (we  denote  them  as  root nodes),  for  example, 
p4  and  p9  in  Figure  2  (b).  These  nodes  have  local 
maximum priorities and tend to occur more often in large 
or sparse networks. However, such nodes are unfavorable 
in our work, since all the relaying paths terminate at these 
nodes  in  the  inward  phase  and  we  hope  more  long-hop-
distance  relaying  paths  can  be  generated  in  that  phase. 
Therefore,  to  improve  the  performance  of  gossiping,  we 
should  avoid  such  situation.  However,  remember  that  the 
proposed  scheme  is  built  on  local  information  instead  of 
complete knowledge of the network topology. One way to 
reduce the number of such nodes is to ask each node p to 
keep  the  maximum  neighbor  gossip-weight,  which  is 
defined as max_ngw (p) = max {gw (u) | u ∈ N1 (p)}, and 
attach this to its HELLO messages. For each node p with 
no  outward  edges,  p  checks  whether  gw  (p)  <  max
{max_ngw (u) | u ∈ N1 (p)}. If  yes, assume q is the one-
hop neighbor of p with the  maximum  value of max_ngw,
then  p  sends  a  notification  message  to  q  for  updating  gw
(q)  to  (gw  (p)  +  max_ngw  (q))  /  2  and  reverses  the 
direction  of  the  edge  between  itself  and  q.  Both  nodes 
then  recalculate  the  inward  and  outward  timeout  periods. 
Similar techniques can be applied to reduce the number of 
the  marked nodes  with no inward edges (we denote them 
as  leaf nodes).  Under  the  assumption  that  the  cost  of 
forwarding  messages  in  a  local  area  is  acceptable  in 
wireless  ad  hoc  networks,  the  above  heuristics  can  be 
extended to trace the gossip weight of the nodes in the k-
hop neighborhood, where k is small compared to D.
7. Simulation Results 
We  have  developed  a  simulator  using  C++.  The 
experiments  were  carried  on  random  unit  graphs  and  the 
parameters  are  based  on  [5]. The  transmission  range R  is 
fixed at 500 meters. The map sizes are equal to s × R, for s
= 5, 6, 7, 8 (we omit the networks that are too dense or too
