true of latent interactions? Since Renren users have full access to
the list of recent visitors to their proﬁle, it is possible for people to
pay return visits to browse the proﬁles of their visitors. The ques-
tion is, does visiting other user proﬁles actually trigger reciprocal
visits?
As the ﬁrst step towards looking at reciprocity of latent interac-
tions, we construct the set of visitors who view each user proﬁle,
and the set of people who are visited by each user. Then, we com-
pute the intersection and union of these two sets for every user.
Intuitively, intersections include people who view a given user pro-
ﬁle and are also visited by that user, i.e. the latent interactions are
reciprocated. Unions contain all latent relationships for a given
user, i.e. all users who viewed them, or they viewed. We calculate
the ratio of intersection size to union size for each user and then
plot the results in Figure 17. The ratio represents the number of
reciprocated latent interactions divided by the total number of la-
tent relationships. For more than 93% of users, less than 10% of
latent relationships are reciprocated. This demonstrates that incom-
ing proﬁle views have little inﬂuence on user’s proﬁle browsing be-
havior. This is surprising, especially considering the fact that users
know that their visits to a proﬁle are visible to its owner through
the visitor history feature.
Next we examine the time-varying characteristics of reciprocal
proﬁle visits for both strangers and friends. We compute the num-
ber of reciprocal visits that take place within t days after the initial
visit. Figure 18 shows the results for threshold t values of 1 and
5 days plus the entire 90 days. As we look at increasingly larger
window sizes, we see more proﬁle visits being reciprocated. How-
ever, reciprocity remains low overall. Even across the entire mea-
surement period, 73% of users receive no reciprocal page views
from strangers, and 45% of users obtain no reciprocal page views
from friends. This demonstrates that even with Renren’s visitor his-
tory feature, visiting other user proﬁles is not sufﬁcient to generate
reciprocal visits. Compared to strangers, friends have relatively
higher probability of reciprocal visits.
We take a further step and quantify the lack of reciprocity for la-
tent interactions. For a data set of n users, if user i visits user j, then

trast, reciprocity of visible comments on Renren is 0.49, and the
reciprocity of visible interactions on Cyworld [7] is 0.78. Com-
pared to these visible interactions, latent interactions show much
less reciprocity.
3.4 Latent vs. Visible Interactions
In this section, we compare the characteristics of latent and visi-
ble interactions. To understand the level of participation of different
users in both latent and visible interactions, Figure 19 plots the con-
tribution of different users to both kinds of interactions. The bulk of
all visible interactions can be attributed to a very small, highly in-
teractive portion of the user-base: the top 28% of users account for
all such interactions. In contrast, latent interactions are quite preva-
lent across the entire population, with more than 93% of all users
contributing to latent interaction events. This conﬁrms our origi-
nal hypothesis that users are more active in viewing proﬁles than
leaving comments, potentially because of a sense of anonymity in
proﬁle browsing. Given its widespread nature, this result also un-
derscores the importance of understanding latent interactions as a
way of propagating information across OSNs.
Next, we compare latent and visible interactions in coverage of
friends. We compute for each user a distribution of their latent
and visible interactions across their social links. We then aggregate
across all users the percentage of friends involved in these events
and plot the results in Figure 20. We see that roughly 80% of users
only interact visibly with 5% of their friends, and no users interact
with more than 40% of their friends. In contrast, about 80% of users
view 20% or more of their friends’ proﬁles, and a small portion of
the population views all of their friends’ proﬁles regularly. Thus,
although not all social links are equally active, latent interactions
cover a wider range of friends than visible interactions.
To get a sense of how many visible comments are generated by
latent interactions, we examine the average number of comments
per page view for a variety of pages on Renren, including proﬁles,
diary entries, and photos. Figure 21 plots the results. Recall that
along with visible comments, Renren keeps a visitor counter for
each photo and diary entry. For diary entries and photos, the con-
version rate is very low: 99% of users have less than 0.2 com-
ments for every photo view, and 85% people have less than 0.2
comments for every diary view. This indicates that most users

are passive information consumers:
they view/read content and
then move on without commenting themselves. In contrast, proﬁle
views have a higher conversion rate. Interestingly, 13% of users
have a view/comment ratio greater than 1. This is because these
users use proﬁle comments as a form of instant messaging chat,
leaving multiple responses and replies upon each visit.
Finally, we analyze the repeat activity frequency for latent and
visible interactions on Renren.
In particular, we want to exam-
ine the likelihood that users will repeatedly interact with the same
page once they have viewed or commented on it once. Figure 22
plots the average number of interactions each user has with proﬁle
pages. 80% of users view a given proﬁle 10000

in between a user joining and leaving Renren. Neither of these
pieces of information is provided by Renren, and thus must be esti-
mated. Join date can be approximated by the timestamp of the ﬁrst
comment received by a user, since the comment is likely to be a
“welcome message” from a friend greeting the new user [29]. Be-
cause abandoned and inactive accounts can still receive comments,
the best estimate of departure time is the timestamp of the last com-
ment left by a user.
User-generated content.
Do users who frequently update their
proﬁles and upload new content attract the most visitors? This in-
cludes user’s status updates, diary entries, photos, and shared links
to content on the web.
Comments.
Do users who comment frequently attract more
users? Comments are snippets of text that user’s can attach to other
pieces of user-generated content.
We divide users into 4 groups based on their popularity, calculate
the average value of these factors in each group, and display the
results in Table 2. All factors increase along with popularity, i.e. the
most popular users also have the most friends, the oldest accounts,
and generate the largest amounts of content/visible interactions.
Given the drastic differences in size of each popularity group,
and the average nature of the values in Table 2, it is difﬁcult to
infer deﬁnite correlations between any one factor and popularity.
To analyze these correlations more speciﬁcally, we leverage a tech-
nique from prior work [4] called Spearman’s rank correlation co-
efﬁcient (Spearman’s ρ). Spearman’s ρ is a non-parametric mea-
sure of the correlation between two variables that is closely re-
lated to Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient [18]. It is deﬁned as ρ =
1− 6
, where xi and yi are the ranks of two different fea-
tures in a data set of n users. ρ >0 indicates positive correlation,
while <0 indicates negative correlation.

n(n2−1)

Table 2 shows Spearman’s ρ in parenthesis beside the average
value for each factor. Although all factors exhibit high correlation
with the low popularity and “all users” categories, this is an artifact
of the tied ranks among the (numerous) low activity users. All of
these users exhibit very low interactivity and social degree, thus
leading to high levels of correlation. Previous work has observed
similar artifacts when analyzing all users in a large OSN dataset [4].
For the two median popularity groups (100-1000 and 1000-10000),
number of friends has the highest correlation with popularity. Users
in these categories can be broadly deﬁned as normal social net-
work users. They are not celebrities; they simply use the OSN for
its intended purpose of sharing information with friends. This is
reﬂected in the fact that users in these categories show relatively
high levels of correlation across all user-generated content cate-
gories. Account lifetime is a less important factor for users in the
1000-10000 popularity range, given the ease with which users can
quickly amass hundreds of friends on OSNs.
No factor has strong correlation with popularity for users in the
high popularity group. Spearman’s ρ for photos and shared links
are even negative. This is an important ﬁnding, as it shows pop-
ularity is not trivially gained simply by having lots of friends, or
producing copious amounts of user-generated content. Therefore,
there must be other factors outside the scope of our measurements
that contribute to determine user popularity. One possibility is that
quality, rather than quantity, of content may be a signiﬁcant draw to
attract visitors. Another possibility is that real-world celebrity sta-
tus is the most important determining factor of online popularity.
Unfortunately, we cannot quantify these factors at present.
Recall that 100 of the most popular users in the university net-
work are recommended to users by Renren. These 100 users ac-
count for less than 19.3% of the total users in the high popularity
group, so the recommendation mechanism has limited impact on
the high popularity group results.
5. LATENT INTERACTION GRAPHS
Previous studies have demonstrated that taking visible interac-
tions into account has important implications for applications that
leverage social graphs [29]. These changes can be modeled by in-
teraction graphs, which are constructed by connecting users from
the social graph who have visibly interacted one or more times.
We have already demonstrated signiﬁcant differences between
latent and visible interaction patterns on Renren. To summarize
these key differences brieﬂy, latent interactions are more numer-
ous, non-reciprocal, and often connect non-friend strangers. These
results are also likely to have profound implications on applications
that leverage social graphs, and thus warrant the construction of a
new model to capture the properties of latent interactions. We call
this new model a latent interaction graph. In this section we for-
mally deﬁne latent interaction graphs, analyze their salient proper-
ties, and compare them to the Renren social and visible interaction
graphs.
5.1 Building Latent Interaction Graphs
A latent interaction graph is deﬁned as a set of users (nodes) that
are connected via edges representing latent interaction events be-
tween them. Unlike the social graph and visible interaction graph,
we have shown that latent interaction is non-reciprocal (Section 3.3).
Thus, we use directed edges to represent user’s page views, unlike
the social and visible interaction graphs, which are both undirected.
The set of users (61,405 total) remains unchanged between the so-
cial and interaction graphs. We deﬁne latent interaction in-degree
of a node as the number of visitors who have visited that user’s pro-
ﬁle; while out-degree is the number of proﬁles that user has visited.
We construct latent interaction graphs from our Renren data us-
ing proﬁle views as the latent interactions. We use user comments
as the visible interaction data to construct visible interaction graphs
for Renren. In this paper we restrict our social, latent, and visible
interaction graphs to only contain users from the PKU network,
since these are the only users for which we have complete inter-
action records. Note that we only consider interactions that occur
between users in the PKU network, as it is possible for interac-
tions to originate from or target users outside the network for whom
