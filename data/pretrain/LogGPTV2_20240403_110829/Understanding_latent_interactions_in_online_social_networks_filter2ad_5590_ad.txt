### Analysis of Latent Interactions on Renren

#### Introduction
Renren, a popular social networking platform, allows users to view the list of recent visitors to their profiles. This feature raises the question: do visits to other user profiles trigger reciprocal visits? We explore this by analyzing latent interactions, which are not explicitly visible (e.g., profile views), and comparing them with visible interactions (e.g., comments).

#### Reciprocity of Latent Interactions
To investigate the reciprocity of latent interactions, we first construct two sets for each user:
1. **Set of Visitors**: Users who have viewed a given user's profile.
2. **Set of Visited Users**: Users whose profiles the given user has visited.

We then compute the intersection and union of these sets for every user. The intersection includes users who both viewed a given user's profile and were visited by that user, indicating reciprocated latent interactions. The union contains all users involved in any latent interaction with the given user, either as a viewer or a viewed.

The ratio of the size of the intersection to the size of the union represents the proportion of reciprocated latent interactions. Figure 17 shows that for more than 93% of users, less than 10% of latent relationships are reciprocated. This suggests that incoming profile views have little influence on a user's browsing behavior, despite the visibility of visit history.

#### Time-Varying Characteristics of Reciprocal Profile Visits
Next, we examine the time-varying characteristics of reciprocal profile visits for both strangers and friends. We calculate the number of reciprocal visits that occur within \( t \) days after the initial visit, with \( t \) set to 1, 5, and 90 days. Figure 18 illustrates the results. As the window size increases, more profile visits are reciprocated, but overall reciprocity remains low. Even over the entire 90-day period, 73% of users receive no reciprocal page views from strangers, and 45% receive none from friends. This indicates that the visitor history feature alone is insufficient to generate reciprocal visits. Friends, however, have a higher probability of reciprocal visits compared to strangers.

#### Quantifying Lack of Reciprocity
To further quantify the lack of reciprocity in latent interactions, we use the reciprocity coefficient, defined as:
\[ r = \frac{\sum_{i \neq j} (v_{ij} - \bar{v})(v_{ji} - \bar{v})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i \neq j} (v_{ij} - \bar{v})^2 \sum_{i \neq j} (v_{ji} - \bar{v})^2}} \]
where \( v_{ij} = 1 \) if user \( i \) visits user \( j \), and \( v_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. The reciprocity coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with positive values indicating reciprocity and negative values indicating anti-reciprocity. The reciprocity coefficient for profile visits on Renren is 0.23, significantly lower than the reciprocity of visible comments (0.49) and visible interactions on Cyworld (0.78). This confirms that latent interactions show much less reciprocity compared to visible ones.

#### Comparison of Latent and Visible Interactions
We compare the characteristics of latent and visible interactions to understand user participation and interaction patterns. Figure 19 shows that a small, highly interactive portion of the user base (top 28%) accounts for most visible interactions, while latent interactions are widespread, with over 93% of users contributing to them. This supports the hypothesis that users are more active in viewing profiles due to a sense of anonymity.

Figure 20 compares the distribution of latent and visible interactions across social links. Approximately 80% of users interact visibly with only 5% of their friends, whereas about 80% of users view 20% or more of their friends' profiles. This indicates that latent interactions cover a wider range of friends than visible interactions.

Figure 21 examines the average number of comments per page view for different types of pages (profiles, diary entries, and photos). For diary entries and photos, the conversion rate is very low, with most users being passive information consumers. In contrast, profile views have a higher conversion rate, with 13% of users having a view/comment ratio greater than 1, often using profile comments as a form of instant messaging.

Finally, Figure 22 analyzes the repeat activity frequency for latent and visible interactions. It shows that 80% of users view a given profile 100 times or more, indicating frequent engagement with profiles.

#### Factors Affecting User Popularity
We also investigate factors affecting user popularity, including the number of friends, account lifetime, and user-generated content. Table 2 presents the average values of these factors and their Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. While all factors increase with popularity, the high correlation observed in low-activity users is an artifact of tied ranks. For median popularity groups, the number of friends has the highest correlation with popularity, reflecting the intended use of OSNs for sharing information with friends.

For high-popularity users, no factor shows strong correlation, suggesting that other factors, such as content quality or real-world celebrity status, may play a significant role in determining online popularity.

#### Latent Interaction Graphs
Previous studies have shown the importance of considering visible interactions in social graph applications. We extend this to latent interactions by constructing latent interaction graphs, where nodes represent users and directed edges represent profile views. Unlike social and visible interaction graphs, latent interaction graphs are directed and non-reciprocal. We define the in-degree as the number of visitors to a user's profile and the out-degree as the number of profiles visited by the user.

Figure 23 shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of node degrees for latent interaction, visible interaction, and social graphs. The latent interaction graph reveals unique properties, such as non-reciprocal connections and interactions between non-friend strangers, which have important implications for social graph applications.

In conclusion, our analysis highlights the distinct characteristics of latent interactions on Renren, emphasizing the need for a new model to capture these properties and their impact on social graph applications.
