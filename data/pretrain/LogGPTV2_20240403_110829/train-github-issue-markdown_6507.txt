After some discussion in the list, we felt that the dtype should be immutable.
Currently this is not the case, as the `names` attribute can be changed:
    In [19]: t = np.dtype("i4,f4")
    In [20]: t
    Out[20]: dtype([('f0', '<i4'), ('f1', '<f4')])
    In [21]: hash(t)
    Out[21]: -9041335829180134223
    In [22]: t.names = ('one', 'other')
    In [23]: t
    Out[23]: dtype([('one', '<i4'), ('other', '<f4')])
    In [24]: hash(t)
    Out[24]: 8637734220020415106
[although the change of the hash seems to depend on the Python version]
As a bonus, an immutable `dtype` would render this ticket #1725  
without effect.
