### P13's Experience with Account Separation

P13 described the challenges of maintaining separate accounts for personal and work purposes, despite the serious risks involved:

"I log in to Kaufmich [a sex-work advertising site] on my personal phone, and my Apple account for my work phone is registered under my passport name. ... I sometimes hate myself for it. ... This could get me killed or deported. ... I am not prepared." (P13)

Notably, while many interview participants reported issues with payment processors and a lack of anonymous payment options, none mentioned using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. P3 explained, "I’m not enough of a techie for that. ... [and] nobody’s ever suggested it." Instead, most sex workers relied on cash, though this method's effectiveness varied depending on the type of sex work (e.g., cam performers cannot collect cash from viewers).

Several participants expressed regret about insufficient precautions. Some felt they had made unsafe choices when creating their accounts and were now stuck with those decisions. P16 stated, "You can’t erase what you’ve done on the Internet." This sense of irreversibility may discourage some workers from adopting more rigorous privacy practices in the future.

### 5. Discussion

Sex workers face significant risks both online and offline. Our findings indicate that participants have nuanced and multidimensional conceptions of safety, encompassing physical security, financial security, respect, privacy, legality, clear boundaries, and access to supportive communities. Safety strategies must simultaneously address multiple goals.

We identified primary sources of risk and safety strategies for this high-risk population, who often rely on the internet for their work but face severe consequences if their strategies fail. While participants have well-developed protective measures like client vetting, many online strategies involve logical or physical mechanisms—such as using two mobile phones, avoiding posting identifiable photos, and self-censorship—rather than platform-integrated privacy settings. Few used dedicated security tools, and those who did often abandoned them due to complexity or interference with other goals.

#### 5.1 Building for Sex Work

Many of the risks faced by participants are not solvable through improved privacy and security tools. Explicit discrimination by social media and payment platforms, poorly designed anti-sex-work laws, and societal stigma contribute to a dangerous work environment. Addressing these issues requires collective action, changing perceptions, policy, and legal reforms, rather than just technical solutions.

We identify two ways in which technical tools can enhance sex worker safety:
1. **Modifying Existing Tools:** Tools can be adapted to better fit the use cases and threat models of sex workers.
2. **Creating New Tools:** New safety tools can be developed to address currently unmet needs.

**Refining Existing Tools:**
Existing tools, such as encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, could help keep message content private from government and corporate surveillance. However, these apps only allow one profile per phone number, making it difficult to safely use them for both work and personal contacts without a second SIM card or phone. This design issue, while not essential for functionality, complicates safe usage for individuals with multiple audiences.

Similarly, while VPNs and Tor offer protection from surveillance, they can disrupt access to critical platforms, such as geolocation-based vetting services. Platforms that manage access through IP location risk denying legitimate users who need a VPN.

**Protecting Workers During Client Interactions:**
Digital security and privacy tools can help protect personal information from clients and work information from family and friends, and enable boundary-setting. Fine-grained privacy settings can be useful, but data aggregation and recommendation algorithms can still lead to exposure. These issues suggest that many social media platforms fail to support users managing multiple identities, and that reviewing and changing data-use policies is crucial.

**Financial Security:**
Lack of access to digital payment platforms is a major financial risk. Cryptocurrencies, while offering anonymous payments, are not widely used by our participants. They introduce additional challenges, such as getting clients to use them and the need to convert between currencies. Most participants prefer cash, despite its own set of problems.

**Opportunities for New Tools:**
Participants have identified opportunities for bespoke safety tools. For example, an app to help sex workers stay safe without a dependable community, or automated copyright takedown requests for sites that republish stolen content.

Usable safety tools for sex workers can support their safety and independence. However, these tools must be grounded in the experiences and legal contexts of sex workers, and ideally, led by them. Collectives like Assembly Four and Hacking//Hustling provide models for such collaboration.

#### 5.2 Designing for Diverse Populations

Sex workers' needs highlight the importance of identity management online. Being able to use pseudonyms and keep profiles unlinked from legal identities is critical for many, similar to the needs of trans people, drag queens, and intimate partner abuse survivors. Allowing fully pseudonymous profiles, unlinked from emails and phone numbers, can reduce the risk of digital boundary violations.

However, sex workers also need real or persistent contact information for client vetting. Fully pseudonymous or anonymous profiles on platforms they use could create new safety challenges. Anonymity on social networking sites can also enable further abuse and harassment, especially against women, minorities, and marginalized groups.

#### 5.3 Broadening the Scope of Security

Our results underscore the multidimensional nature of digital safety. Participants have well-defined ideas of what they need to stay safe, including financial security, boundary regulation, respect, and physical safety. These elements are often not central to the design and study of security and privacy tools. Future research and development should holistically consider the multi-dimensional aspects of users' safety experiences. Security researchers and developers must revisit their assumptions to better align with user needs.

### 6. Conclusion

Through interviews and surveys with sex workers, we examined their safety goals, perceived risks, and risk-mitigation behaviors. Participants defined safety across multiple interrelated axes and perceived risks from clients, platforms, and legal entities. Our findings show that sex workers are aware of the risks and employ various methods to protect their privacy and security online. However, they often rely on manual strategies, such as using multiple devices, because current tools do not balance effort and efficacy to meet their needs. Studying high-risk populations is crucial for developing better security tools to protect both these groups and users in general.
