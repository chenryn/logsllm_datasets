P13 described how despite the serious risks for them, keep-
ing accounts separate in the course of using them day-to-day
felt impossible:
“I login to Kaufmich [a sex-work advertising site]
in browser on my personal phone and my Apple
account for work phone is registered to my passport
name. . . . I hate myself for it sometimes. . . . This
stuff could get me killed or deported. . . . I am not
prepared.” (P13)
Particularly of note, although many of our interview partici-
pants described having problems with payment processors and
two even lamented the lack of anonymous payment platforms,
none described using Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. P3
said, “I’m not enough of a techie for that. . . [and] nobody’s
ever suggested it.” Instead, most sex workers relied on cash.
How well this works, of course, depends on their type of sex
work (e.g., cam performers cannot collect cash from viewers).
Several other participants similarly described feeling regret
about taking insufﬁcient precautions. Some expressed that
they had originally made choices they felt were unsafe when
creating an account, but now felt stuck with those choices; as
P16 put it, “You can’t erase what you’ve done on the Internet.”
This sense that it’s impossible to correct past mistakes may
keep some workers from engaging in more careful privacy
management in the future.

5 Discussion
Sex workers experience salient risks both ofﬂine and online.
Our ﬁndings show that our participants have nuanced and mul-
tidimensional conceptions of safety and a clear understanding
of both digital and ofﬂine risks. While physical security was
a critical part of safety, safety also included ﬁnancial security,
respect, privacy, legality, clear online and ofﬂine boundaries,
and access to a community that could help support safety prac-
tices. Participants’ safety strategies must thus simultaneously
support multiple safety goals.
We further identify the primary sources of risk and safety
strategies of this high-risk population, who often need to use
the Internet to do their work but also face signiﬁcant conse-
quences if their strategies fail. While our participants have
well-developed sex-work-speciﬁc protective strategies like
covering and vetting clients, many online strategies relied on
logical or physical mechanisms — e.g., having two mobile
phones, carefully keeping photos with their faces off the In-
ternet, and self-censoring in both work and personal online
spaces — rather than using, e.g., platform integrated privacy
settings. Few participants used dedicated security tools, and
those who did were likely to abandon them, either because
they felt the tools were more work than they were worth, or
because they disrupted competing work and safety goals.
5.1 Building for sex work.
Ultimately, many of the risks our participants face are not
solvable by improved privacy and security tools. Instead, ex-
plicit discrimination by social media and payment platforms,
poorly designed and explicitly anti-sex-work laws, as well as
stigma from the general population, contribute to a dangerous
work environment for sex workers. Solutions to the largest
problems depend on collective action leading to changing
perceptions of sex work, policy changes, and legal changes,
rather than the strategic deployment of technical solutions.
With this in mind, we identify two primary ways in which
technical tools can enhance sex worker safety. First, existing
tools could be modiﬁed to accommodate the use cases and
threat models experienced by sex workers. Second, new safety
tools that speciﬁcally address currently unmet sex worker
needs can be created.
Reﬁning existing tools. Existing tools are especially well
positioned to address surveillance risks (e.g., at the border
while traveling internationally, by police or governments, or
by cross-platform tracking and data aggregation). However,
upon examining why these tools are not widely used, we
found that many violate other critical safety goals.
In particular, encrypted messaging tools like Signal and
WhatsApp could help sex workers keep message content pri-
vate from both government and corporate surveillance.6 How-
6WhatsApp no longer keeps messages to businesses private, and continues
ever, because both applications only allow a single proﬁle per
phone number, safely using Signal or WhatsApp with both
work and personal contacts might further depend on having a
second SIM card or phone, lest the wrong audience see the
wrong name or proﬁle photo. In this case, an application with
otherwise desirable security properties (e.g., end-to-end en-
cryption and blocking features) becomes harder to use safely
for someone with a need to communicate simultaneously
with disparate audiences. This design is not necessary for the
functioning of the tool — either app could likely enable some
limited number of proﬁles per account without necessarily
sacriﬁcing other security properties like end-to-end encryp-
tion.
Similarly, VPNs and Tor may offer some protection from
surveillance, but their value signiﬁcantly decreases when they
disrupt the user’s ability to access the forums or platforms they
depend on to stay safe, as one of our participants experienced
when they were unable to access geolocation-based vetting
platforms. Platforms that manage access through IP location
risk denying access to legitimate users who need a VPN [47].
Protecting workers during interactions with clients is an-
other space in which existing digital security and privacy
tools have the potential for impact. The safety goals here
are usually to keep personal information from clients, keep
work information from family and friends, and to be able
to draw boundaries and cut off contact with clients when
they become aggressive. In these cases, having access to ﬁne-
grained privacy and visibility settings may help some workers
(those who know about them and trust them), but our partic-
ipants found that even this careful management fails due to
invisible data aggregation, resulting in being outed through
people recommendation algorithms or having personal ac-
counts blacklisted because of their work account’s activity.
Over time, failure seemed inevitable. These issues suggest
that many social media platforms continue to fail users who
have multiple identities to manage, and that reviewing and
changing a platform’s data-use policies can be as critical as
creating intuitive front-end settings.
Finally, one major risk to workers’ ﬁnancial security, a di-
mension of safety, was lack of access to digital payment plat-
forms. Cryptocurrencies offer anonymous digital payments
and thus might seem like an obvious solution. However, vir-
tually none of our participants used tools like Bitcoin. Cryp-
tocurrencies introduce additional difﬁculties: getting clients to
use such services, even if workers are comfortable using them,
and the need to convert between currencies in an already-
difﬁcult banking situation. Thus, the vast majority of our par-
ticipants turned to the analog solution, cash, despite having
its own set of problems.
In this case, cryptocurrencies serve as a useful example
of how questions of access and usability are not the ﬁrst
to degrade user protection from corporate surveillance [19]; we include it
here because at the moment it remains the most popular encrypted messaging
application.

that researchers and technologists should ask when building
or improving security tools for high-risk users. Rather than
considering how we can make cryptocurrencies easier to use
for sex workers and clients, we should consider whether they
are addressing the fundamental need in the ﬁrst place. For
many, they do not. Our participants need simple anonymous
payments, but Bitcoin and similar tools are massively complex
systems that do not provide anonymous digital cash. Instead,
they provide an entirely independent currency that ﬂuctuates
wildly, requires currency brokers and new accounts, and puts
users at risk of a massive network of targeted attacks seeking
to steal account credentials.
Opportunities for new tools. As articulated by our partici-
pants, there may also be opportunities to build bespoke safety
tools that better support sex workers speciﬁcally.
For example, P27 describes their ideal covering app, which
could help sex workers stay safe without a dependable com-
munity. Additionally, while there are no technical mecha-
nisms currently available to prevent photos and ads from
being copied and republished, there may be opportunity for
automating copyright take-down requests for major sites that
steal and republish content.
Usable safety tools for sex workers have the potential to
support the safety and independence of a sizable population.
However, as can be seen from other security tools, if not
well-grounded in the experiences of sex workers and their par-
ticular legal context, tools can be at best useless and at worst
harmful. Design and operation of new tools and platforms
should include, and ideally be led by, sex workers. Several
sex work and technology collectives like Assembly Four [6]
and Hacking//Hustling [28] offer models for this type of col-
laboration.
5.2 Designing across diverse populations.
In many instances, sex workers provide another data point
showing that many common digital mechanisms can amplify
risk and complicate protective strategies. In other instances,
however, their needs may diverge from other high-risk popu-
lations. This tension should be considered when looking to
design for a given community and in building general-purpose
tools.
For example, being able to use a pseudonym or keep pro-
ﬁles unlinked from their legal identity is critical for the safety
of many of our participants, as it sometimes also is for trans
people [16], drag queens [52], and intimate partner abuse
survivors [45], among others. Our ﬁndings underscore why
identity management online is an important security and pri-
vacy issue, and may suggest that allowing users to have fully
pseudonymous proﬁles — that is, even unlinked from emails
and phone numbers that could be used elsewhere — may re-
duce the risk of digital boundary violations that lead to stalk-
ing and harassment [48]. Even in cases where users do the
work to keep proﬁles separate, unwanted and unexpected inter-
sections of work and personal identities online through friend
recommendation algorithms or through being identiﬁed by
use of a shared, single phone number or email across personal
and work platforms can cause signiﬁcant problems.
At the same time, sex workers themselves depend on hav-
ing the real — or at least persistent — contact information
for clients to vet them and keep track of their behavior and
preferences. If fully pseudonymous or anonymous proﬁles
were in place on many of the platforms sex workers use, they
could ﬁnd themselves facing new safety challenges, as ex-
isting vetting systems may fail. Furthermore, anonymity on
social networking sites can enable further abuse and harass-
ment, which is frequently levied against women, minorities,
and other marginalized groups [70].
5.3 Broadening the scope of security.
Beyond designing speciﬁc technical tools, our results under-
score the multidimensional nature of digital safety. Our par-
ticipants had well-deﬁned ideas of what they needed in or-
der to stay safe. However, many of the elements that were
central to their safety goals, like ﬁnancial security, bound-
ary regulation, respect, and even physical safety, are often
not central to the design and study of security and privacy
tools and experiences. Our work adds support to a growing
body of evidence [23, 24, 30, 33, 41, 46, 61, 70] that online
safety involves axes beyond — but intertwined with — digital
security and privacy. Thus, we encourage future research and
development to holistically consider the multi-dimensional
aspects that comprise users’ safety experiences. Security re-
searchers and developers must revisit their assumptions about
risk and beneﬁt to better align with the needs articulated by
their users [40].
6 Conclusion
Through interviews and surveys with sex workers, we exam-
ine sex workers’ safety goals, their perception of risks to those
goals, and the behaviors they employ to mitigate these risks.
Our participants expressed that their safety was deﬁned across
multiple interrelated axes, and they perceived risks to their
safety from clients, platforms, and legal entities. Our results
suggest that sex workers are not only aware of the risks pre-
sented by digitally-mediated sex work but are also employing
multiple ways to protect privacy and security while online.
However, they often rely on manual strategies, such as using
multiple devices, as current tools do not balance effort and
efﬁcacy well enough to address their safety needs and goals.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate the importance of studying high-
risk populations, in order to develop better security tools to
protect both those populations and users in general.
