3.2 End-to-End Probes
Another type of data that can be obtained from direct
measurements are the end-to-end loss rates. In this work, we
use periodic probes that are sent with constant inter-arrival
times. From the probes, we can calculate the end-to-end
loss rates and their covariances.
To estimate the end-to-end transmission rates, each bea-
con in VB sends S unicast probes to every destination in D.
fraction of these S probes that arrive correctly at the des-
For each path Pi, let bφi be the random variable giving the
tination, and let bφi,ek be the fraction of these probes that
have traversed link ek successfully. Let bφek be the fraction
of probes from all paths passing through link ek that have
not been dropped by that link. The loss rate of path Pi
is the complement to 1 of its transmission rate, deﬁned as
φi = E[bφi]. Similarly, the transmission rate of link ek is
φek = E[bφek ]
Let Yi = logbφi and Xk = logbφek , which we group in vec-
tors. In this paper, we use a bold letter to represent a vector,
for example Y = [Y1 Y2 . . . Ynp ]T and X = [X1 X2 . . . Xnc ]T ,
where T denotes transposition.
We make the following assumptions that are necessary to
establish the linear relatioship between end-to-end loss rates
and link loss rates:
• S.1 Identical sampled rates: bφi,ek = bφek almost
surely (a.s.) for all paths Pi that traverse ek.
• S.2 Link independence: The random variables Xk
are independent.
Assumption S.1 means that the fraction of packets lost
at link ek is the same for all paths Pi traversing the link,
which holds by the law of large numbers provided S is large
enough. However we do not want to take S too large, as we
want to exploit the stochastic variability of these variables
in diﬀerent snapshots, as we will see later. Hence this as-
sumption is actually an approximation, which is valid when
E[(bφek − bφi,ek )2] ≪ E[(bφek − φek )2].
(1)
Such an approximation is reasonable because a congested
link ek will experience diﬀerent congestion levels at diﬀerent
times (hence a large value of the right hand side of (1), which
is the variance of bφek ); whereas all paths Pi traversing ek in
the same period of time will have very similar sample means
of lost packets (hence a small value of the left hand side
of (1)).
Assumption S.2 may also not apply to all links, however
previous works [14, 24] show that the correlation of network
links is weak and does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the accuracy
of their diagnosis. Under this assumption, the covariance
matrix of X is diagonal and reads
ΓX = diag(v) = diag([v1 v2 . . . vnc ]),
(2)
where vk = VAR(Xk).
Using these two assumptions, given the network topology
and end-to-end path loss rates, we can then easily establish
linear relationships between the link loss rates and the path
loss rates as (a.s.)
Y = RX.
(3)
To determine the link loss rates, we need to solve the system
of linear equations (3). Recall here that it does not have
a unique solution because in most networks the matrix R
is rank deﬁcient, that is, rank(R) < min(np, nc).
In the
example of Figure 2, rank(R) = 5 < min(6, 8). In this paper,
we overcome the rank deﬁcient problem of (3) by exploiting
spatial correlations between diﬀerent path measurements.
3.3 Performance Model
To study the correlation between the path measurements,
we divide the measurement time into slots, each of duration
S probes. The collections of all measurements on all end-to-
end paths in a given time slot, obtained by sending S probes
from each beacon in VB to each probing destinations in D,
is called a snapshot of the network. We use m snapshots
Y = {y1, y2, ..., ym} to calculate the covariances between
diﬀerent path loss rates. Let Σ be the covariance matrix of
Y, i.e.,
Σ =

We make the following assumption about the link vari-
ances v
• S.3 Monotonicity of variance: The variance vk of
Xk is a non-decreasing function of 1 − φek .
This assumption holds in real networks as shown in all
previous Internet measurements [31, 35] where high average
loss-rates are always associated with high loss-rate varia-
tions. The assumption deﬁnitely holds in our own measure-
ments of the PlanetLab network over one day as shown in
Figure 3.
The idea of dividing measurements into multiple time slots
was ﬁrst suggested in [14] and is used in [22] to study bi-
nary network performances. By dividing measurements into
small time slots, we can exploit the stochastic variations of
link loss rates, which will prove essential to classifying links
as congested or not - thanks to Assumption S.3 (in the pro-
cess explained in Section 5.2.) Averaging the estimated loss
rates over the whole measurement duration would miss these
short term variations in network links and would eventually
end up in an under-determined system as in (3). But we need
to choose S large enough, so that Assumption S.1 holds.
Choosing the optimal duration S requires a complete knowl-
edge about link loss processes at small time-scales and the
eﬀect of active probes on the network. These questions have
been partially addressed in the literature [25, 27] and are
outside the scope of this paper. Instead, we use a heuristic
that chooses S = 1000 in our simulations and experiments.
This heuristic may not be optimal, but it is reasonable for
the dynamics of the Internet losses as shown in [35]. We
will see in Section 6.3 that our scheme is robust to diﬀerent
values of S.

IDENTIFIABILITY OF THE LINK
VARIANCES
In this section, we show that the variances v of the link
performances X can be uniquely identiﬁed from end-to-end
measurements in any network topology that satisﬁes as-
sumptions T.1-2. We call this property of the network
link loss-rates the statistical identiﬁability property. This
property is important because it guarantees that by using a
correct inference algorithm we can accurately calculate the
link variances from the measured data.
Let us formulate this property mathematically. Denote
by Σv the covariance matrix of the measurements when the
link variances are v. The link variances are statistically
identiﬁable if and only if the condition
Σv = Σ˜v for any sequence of snapshots y
always implies that v = ˜v.
Our interest in this section, is to ﬁnd v, given the m snap-
shots and Assumptions T.1-2 and S.1-3. As we will show
later, all of the Assumptions T.1-2 and S.1-3 are needed
for the identiﬁcation of v and the link loss rates.

UDP probing packets over a period of 10 seconds
between the end-hosts. The mean and variance of
each path loss rate are calculated using 250 loss rate
samples.
From (2) and (3),
Σ = RΓXRT = Rdiag(v)RT .

R =

and
R = [R∗1R∗2 . . . R∗nc ].
We use the notation ⊗ to denote the element-wise product
of two vectors, i.e.,
Ri∗ ⊗ Rj∗ = [Ri,1Rj,1 Ri,2Rj,2 . . . Ri,nc Rj,nc ].
Definition 1. Let A be the augmented matrix of dimen-
sion np(np + 1)/2 × nc whose rows consist of the rows of
R and the component wise products of each pair of diﬀer-
ent rows from R. The rows of A are arranged as follows:
A((i−1)×np +(j−i)+1)∗ = Ri∗ ⊗ Rj∗ for all 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ np.

To prove the identiﬁability of v, we use the same strategy
of considering the algebraic properties of the augmented ma-
trix A (similar to [8]) to estimate traﬃc matrices of Gaussian
traﬃc ﬂows. However, the two results are totally diﬀerent
and require diﬀerent analyses. In [8], the measurements are
made on the links and the unknowns are the end-to-end
ﬂows, whereas in this work the measurements are the end-
to-end ﬂows and the unknowns are the link performances.
The proof in [8] is much simpler as the traﬃc counts on the
ﬁrst and last links of an OD-path share only the traﬃc of
this OD pair. The covariance between the ﬁrst and the last
link of a path is therefore suﬃcient to retrieve the variance
of the traﬃc count in that path.
In contrast, we do not
have this simple relation here. Hence we need to exploit the
more complex recursive relations between path covariances
and link variances to identify the latter. Our identiﬁability
result of v can be viewed as the “dual” of the identiﬁability
result in Corollary 1 of [8].
Given Deﬁnition 1, we now state and prove the following
lemma.
Lemma 1. The equations Σ = Rdiag(v)RT are equivalent
to the equations Σ∗ = Av, where Σ∗ is a vector of length
np(np + 1)/2 and Σ∗
(i−1)np +j−i+1 = Σi,j for all 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤
np.
Proof. The result follows from expanding Rdiag(v)RT .
Lemma 2. v is identiﬁable if and only if A has full col-
umn rank.
Proof. Assume that two variance vectors v and ˜v give
the same end-to-end covariance matrix Σ: Rdiag(v)RT =
Rdiag(˜v)RT . This would imply that R(diag(v)−diag(˜v))RT =
0, or equivalently from Lemma 1 that A (v − ˜v) = 0. Hence,
v − ˜v = 0 if and only if A has full column rank.
Let us ﬁrst consider a monitoring system with a single bea-
con B. Let R be the (reduced) routing matrix for this sys-
tem(i.e., after grouping alias IP links together and removing
all-zero columns). Observe that a node in such a tree is
either a leaf (i.e., a destination in D) or has at least two
children, because otherwise the edge before and the edge
after the node would be alias links and would be grouped
together in a virtual link.
Lemma 3. Let R be the routing matrix of a single bea-
con network. The variances v of the links represented by
columns of R are identiﬁable from end-to-end measurements
if Assumptions T.1-2 hold.
Lemma 3 is stated indirectly without a complete proof in [9].
Here, we provide the proof of this lemma as it will be used
later in our proof of Theorem 1.
Proof. Let us pick any branch of this tree, let n be its
number of nodes, which we index in increasing distance from
B = v0, and which we denote by v1, v2, . . . , vn. Without loss
of generality, let us place the columns corresponding to the
n links ek = (vk−1, vk), 1 ≤ k ≤ n, of this branch in the ﬁrst
n columns of matrices R and A. Remember that because
of the reduction step described above, the (n − 1) nodes
v1, v2, . . . , vn−1 must have at least two children, whereas vn
is a leaf.
Let us consider the ﬁrst link e1 = (B, v1). As v1 has at
least two children, we can always ﬁnd two paths Pi and Pi′ ,
with i < i′, which traverse e1 and diverge at v1, so that Pi
passes though one of these two children and Pi′ through the
other. Therefore Ri,1 = Ri′,1 = 1 but Ri,j 6= Ri′ ,j for all
j ≥ 2, hence A((i−1)np+(i′−i)+1)∗ = Ri∗ ⊗Ri′ ∗ = [1 0 . . . 0].
As a result, the ﬁrst column A∗1 is linearly independent from
all other columns of A.
We now proceed by induction for all other links. Let
2 ≤ k ≤ n − 2, and suppose that each of the k ﬁrst columns
of A is linearly independent from all other columns of A. Let
us then consider the link ek+1 = (vk, vk+1). As the internal
node vk+1 has at least two children, we can always ﬁnd a pair
of paths Pi and Pi′ , with i < i′, which traverse e1, . . . , ek+1
and diverge at vk+1, so that Pi passes though one child of
vk+1 and Pi′ through another. Therefore A(i−1)np +(i′−i)+1,j
is 1 if 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1, and 0 if k + 2 ≤ j ≤ nc. This
implies that column A∗(k+1) can only be a linear combina-
tion of a set of columns that contains at least one of the k
ﬁrst columns A∗1, . . . , A∗k. From our induction assumption,
these k columns are linearly independent from any other col-
umn of A, and thus in particular from A∗(k+1). Therefore
A∗(k+1) is linearly independent from all other columns of A.
Finally, the last link of the branch en = (vn−1, vn) ends up
on the leaf node vn. This node appears therefore in only one
path Pi from B to vn, and therefore A(i−1)np+1,j = R2
i,j = 1
if 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and is equal to 0 if n + 1 ≤ j ≤ nc. This
implies again that A∗n can only be a linear combination of
a set of columns that contains at least one of the n ﬁrst
columns A∗j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, which is impossible. Therefore all
the n columns corresponding to the n links of the branch are
linearly independent from each other and from every other
column of A.
Repeating this reasoning for every branch of the tree, we
ﬁnd that all columns of A are linearly independent. Because
of Lemma 2, v is identiﬁable. This completes the proof.
We now consider a system with multiple beacons, where R
is the reduced routing matrix after grouping alias links. Let
RB be the sub-matrix of R that contains only the rows rep-
resenting the paths originating from a beacon B, and let AB
be the reduced matrix of A with only the rows representing
paths from B and their element-wise products. As AB is
a sub-matrix of A with the same set of columns but with
fewer rows, any set of linearly dependent columns in A is
also linearly dependent in AB. We can now state and prove
the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Let R be the (reduced) routing matrix of any
multiple beacons monitoring network. The variances v of
the links represented by columns of R are identiﬁable from
end-to-end measurements if Assumptions T.1-2 hold.
Proof. We proceed by contradiction. Assume that there
exists a set F 6= ∅ of links whose columns in A are linearly
dependent. That is,
Xek ∈F
αkA∗k = 0
(5)
with αk 6= 0 for all ek ∈ F. Note that in (5) we only
consider links that are actually linearly dependent (those
with coeﬃcient αk 6= 0) and ignore those that are not (with
coeﬃcient αk = 0).
Pick any beacon B. Let PB be the set of all the paths
originating from B, and let LB be the set of all links tra-
versed by at least one path in PB, and let BB = F ∩ LB.
Our assumption (5) yields that
Xek ∈BB
αkAB
∗k = 0
(6)
because any link ek ∈ F \ BB is not traversed by any path
in PB, which implies that AB
∗k = 0. The columns of AB
representing links in BB are thus linearly dependent.
We now consider three possible cases: (A) |BB| = 1, (B)
|BB| ≥ 2 and (C) |BB| = 0.
(A) Suppose ﬁrst that |BB| = 1. This would yield that
AB
∗j = 0 for the link ej ∈ BB, which in turn would imply
that ej is not traversed by any path in PB, an impossibility
because ej ∈ BB ⊆ LB. Hence |BB| 6= 1.
(B) Suppose next that |BB| ≥ 2. We will show that this
case is impossible, by proceeding as follows: (i) We show
that there is a path Pi ∈ PB that traverses all links in BB,
which we index in increasing order of their distances to the
beacon B. (ii) We show that any path Pi′ that traverses
a link ebk ∈ BB must also traverse at least one of the two
links of BB that are consecutive with ebk on that path. (iii)
Using (ii), we prove that there is a path Pi1 that traverses
the second and third links of BB. (iv) We next prove that
there is a path Pi2 that traverses the third and fourth links
of BB. (v) Finally, we prove by recursion that |B| < 2.
