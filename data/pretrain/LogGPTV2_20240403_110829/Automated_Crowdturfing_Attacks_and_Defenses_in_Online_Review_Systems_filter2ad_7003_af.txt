but the chicken they had a little less oily and overcooked. I would recommend
this place if you are looking for a cheap place to stop by.

I love this place. I went with my brother and we had the vegetarian pasta and
it was delicious. The beer was good and the service was amazing. I would defi-

breakfast and a small spot with a great deal.

I have been a customer for about a year and a half and I have nothing but great
things to say about this place. I always get the pizza, but the Italian beef was
also good and I was impressed. The service was outstanding. The best service I
have ever had. Highly recommended.
Generated with temperature 1.0
The food here is freaking amazing, the portions are giant. The cheese bagel was
cooked to perfection and well prepared, fresh & delicious! The service was fast.
Our favorite spot for sure! We will be back!
