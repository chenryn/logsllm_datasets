User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to log into new EC2 instance Trying to connect using CentOS7

I deployed a couple of EC2 instances using terraform and now and trying to log in.

aws2 ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key --instance-id i-0788274a4861154d44 --availability-zone us-east-2 --instance-os-user ec2-user --ssh-public-key file:/aws_ssh/my_rsa_key.pub

Parameter validation failed:
Invalid length for parameter SSHPublicKey, value: 42, valid range: 256-inf


I tried this command as well

ssh-keygen -t rsa -f my_rsa_key -b 1024


Still gives the same error.

I am new to this so as much help as you can give.

Assistant: Connect using this command.. You tried to connect the instance using the first command...


  aws ec2-instance-connect  send-ssh-public-key --region us-east-1  --instance-id  i-0989ec3292613a4f9  --availability-zone  us-east-1 --instance-os-user ec2-user --ssh-public-key file://mynew_key.pub


After authentication, the public key is made available to the instance through the instance metadata for 60 seconds. During this time, connect to the instance using the associated private key


  ssh  -i  mynew_key  ec2-user@ec2-34-204-200-76.compute-1.amazonaws.com


If for some reason you don’t connect within that 60-second window, you see the following error:


  ssh -i mynew_key ec2-user@ec2-34-204-200-76.compute-1.amazonaws.com
