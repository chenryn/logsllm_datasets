• On each of our 1 MHz and 1 kHz prototypes, the communica-
tion range is higher at lower bit rates. This observation holds for
both our TV and RFID backscatter prototypes. This is expected
because higher bit rates suffer from higher noise that limits the
decoding capability at longer distances.
• Our 1 MHz analog hardware generally achieves higher ranges
than our 1 kHz prototype. This is expected, as the 1 MHz hard-
ware has a higher bandwidth and hence has less effective noise.
• The communication range increases with the power of the sig-
nal at the backscattering device. Using the 1 kHz prototype,
RFID tags can communicate with each other at a rate of 3.33
bps at ranges greater than 90 feet given an incident RF power of
0 dBm. At an incident power level of -15 dBm, the communica-

transmissions nor power from the RFID reader. Our receiver can
harvest power from solar and ambient TV signals in these scenarios.

Distance between interferer and receiver (in ft)
Figure 12—Multiple concurrent transmissions. We place an in-
terferer close to a receiver conﬁgured to receive 1 kchips/s transmis-
sions. We have the interferer transmit at 2 kchips/s and 4 kchips/s
which are orthogonal codes and also at 3 kchips/s and 5 kchips/s
which are non-orthogonal codes to 1 kchips/s. The plots show that
the interferer increases the BER at the receiver when using non-
orthogonal codes. The interference however is minimal with an in-
terferer using orthogonal codes (2 kchips/s and 4 kchips/s).
tion range is over 30 feet with both TV and RFID transmissions.
Such ranges are signiﬁcantly higher than those achieved by ex-
isting systems.
8.2.2
In Non-Line-of-Sight Scenarios
Next, we evaluate µcode’s performance in non-line-of-sight sce-
narios. Conventional RFID technology is limited to line-of-sight
scenarios and is not designed to work through walls or other occlud-
ing obstacles. µcode achieves coding gains in a low-power manner
that allows it to enable communication in through-the-wall scenar-
ios. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate µcode’s ability to achieve both RFID
tag-to-tag communication as well as ambient backscatter commu-
nication in through-the-wall scenarios.
Experiments: We run experiments in a through-the-wall scenario
in our organization, as shown in Fig. 11. The testbed spans ﬁve
rooms and is separated by double sheet-rock (plus insulation) walls
with a thickness of approximately 5.7 inches. Each room is about
20 feet wide and contains typical furniture one would expect in an
ofﬁce (e.g., chairs, tables, couches, etc.). We ﬁx the location of our
single-antenna backscattering device as shown in the testbed. We
then move our receiver prototype away from the transmitter, start-
ing at a distance of one meter with the receiver in the same room
as the backscattering device (no walls), then moving the receiver
to different rooms increasingly distant from the transmitter. For our
RFID tag-to-tag communication results, we place the backscatter-
ing device in the presence of an RFID reader and vary the RF signal
power seen at the device. To evaluate an ambient backscatter sce-
nario, we vary the TV signal power at the backscattering device.We
also run experiments with both our 1 MHz and 1 kHz receiver pro-
totypes and with different bit rates as before. For each power level
observed at the transmitter, we note the number of walls through
which the receiver can still decode the backscattered signal at a
BER of less than 10−2.
Results. Fig. 10(a), and (b) plot the room number at which the sys-
tem works, for both our 1 MHz and 1 kHz hardware. The plots show
that while the devices cannot communicate through walls when the
incident RF power is less than -25 dBm, through-wall communi-
cation is possible when the power level is greater than -25 dBm.
This is true for both RFID tag-to-tag communication and ambient
backscatter communication with TV signals. We believe this is a
signiﬁcant advancement in backscatter communication.
8.3 Evaluating Concurrent Transmissions with µcode
As described in §5, µcode can be used to enable concurrent trans-
mission in the network without suffering from interference. Specif-
ically, one can assign chip sequences that satisfy Lemma 5.2 to dif-
ferent transmitters, allowing them to transmit concurrently without
interference. In this section, we evaluate the feasibility of achieving
this in practice.
To do this, we place a transmitter and our receiver prototype at a
ﬁxed separation of 10 feet. The transmitter and receiver are conﬁg-
ured to use a chip rate of 1 kHz and chip length of 300. We evaluate
the effect of an interfering transmitter on the BER. Speciﬁcally, we
place an interfering transmitter at different distances ranging from
1 feet to 5 feet away from our receiver. The interfering transmit-
ter uses two sets of chip sequences: the ﬁrst set has chip rates of
2kchips/s and 4kchips/s, and the second set has rates of 3kchips/s
and 5kchips/s. The ﬁrst set of chip rates are such that they satisfy
the property in Lemma 5.2 and hence in theory should not interfere
with the receiver. The chip rates in the second set, however, do not
satisfy Lemma 5.2 and hence are expected to create interference.
Fig. 12 plots the computed BER values at the receiver as a func-
tion of distance from the interfering transmitter. The black solid line
corresponds to the baseline results in the absence of an interfering
transmitter. We show plots for the two sets of orthogonal (2 and
4 kchips/s) and non-orthogonal codes (3 and 5 kchips/s). The ﬁgure
shows the following:
• As expected,
the BER values corresponding to the non-
orthogonal codes (3 and 5 kchips/s) are much higher than the
baseline. Speciﬁcally, with a distance of one foot between the
interference transmitter and receiver, the BER is close to 0.5
(which is similar to a random guess). The BER values improve
as the distance from the interfering transmitter increases.
• The BER values for the orthogonal codes (2 and 4 kchips/s) are
close to the baseline without the interfering device. This is true
even when the interferer is as close as one foot away from the re-
ceiver. This demonstrates that µcode can enable concurrent trans-
missions without signiﬁcant interference at the receivers.
9. CONCLUSION
We present two novel communication primitives for backscat-
ter communication systems: µmo, a multi-antenna cancellation re-
ceiver that operates on backscatter devices, and µcode, a coding
mechanism that provides the beneﬁts of CDMA and can be decoded
on backscatter devices. Using these communication primitives, we
enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at dis-
tances of tens of meters and while separated by multiple walls. Fur-
ther, we show that our designs can provide orders of magnitude
increase in the communication rate and range of ambient backscat-
ter systems. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap
forward in the capabilities of backscatter systems.

APPENDIX
A. Proof of Lemma 5.1 Say 2T is the duration of a chip and the amplitudes
corresponding to the one and zero bits are A1 and A2. For simplicity let us
assume that A1 > A2. Now say that chip sequence used to compute the in-
phase component I is s seconds out of synchronization from the transmitted
signal. Given these parameters we can write the following:
I = −sA1 + (2T − s)A1 + sA2 − (2T − s)A2
= (2T − 2s)(A1 − A2)
Now if 0 < s < T, then the quadrature component Q component over
one two chips (01 sequence) is
Q = −(T + s)A1 + (T + s)A1 + (T + s)A2 − (T − s)A2
= −2s(A1 − A2)
Thus, |I| + |Q| = 2T(A1 − A2). On the other hand, if T < s < 2T, then
the quadrature component Q is
Q = (s − T)A1 − (3T − s)A1 − (s − T)A2 + (3T − s)A2
= (2s − 4T)(A1 − A2)
In this case, again, |I| + |Q| = 2T(A1 − A2). Therefore, for any s, |I| +
|Q| = t(A1 − A2). Furthermore, for 2N chips, the computation result will be
NT(A1 − A2), independent of synchronization. Finally, if A1 = 1, A2 = 0
and T = 1/2, then |I| + |Q| = N.
B. Proof of Lemma 5.2 Our goal is to prove that a chip sequence with a
code rate R is orthogonal to one with a code rate 2NR and of chip length
2N. First, within the time period of one chip with a chip rate C, there are
N complete alternating zero-one chips corresponding to the chip sequence
with a chip rate 2NC, independent of synchronization. Assuming that A1 and
A2 are the amplitudes for bits one and zero, the computation for the 1 chip
outputs N(A1 − A2) or −N(A1 − A2), and −N(A1 − A2) or N(A1 − A2) for
0 chip. Thus resulting in a sum of 0 when computed over two consecutive
chips Similarly, the computation on the Q path will output 0 as well for two
consecutive chips. Thus, |I| + |Q| = 0 holds for a decoder tuned to chip
rate C. Next, we look at the decoder for the chip sequence at rate 2NC and
length 2N. Within the time period of 2N chips at a rate of 2NC, there is
one complete 01 chip sequence corresponding to the chip rate of C, thus
the correlation computation of I and Q are zero. Thus again |I| + |Q| = 0,
proving our lemma.
