**Symfony Version(s) Affected:** 4.2

**Description:**

I am developing an affiliation system in my application. After a user registers as an affiliate, a new `ROLE_AFFILIATE` is assigned to their account. However, the user is still denied access to the designated routes, even after updating the `isGranted` method. To resolve this issue, the user must log out and then log back in for the changes to take effect.

Thank you!
