### Issue: Changing Domain Account Password Without Administrative Access

**Scenario:**
- You have two domain accounts.
- One account allows you to log into a Citrix virtual desktop without issues.
- The other account requires a password change before you can log in.
- You are working remotely and cannot log into an RDP session on the servers you have access to without first changing the password.

**Question:**
Is it possible to change the password for the second account if you know the current password but cannot log in with that account?

**Answer:**

Yes, it is possible to change the password for the second account from a domain-joined and connected machine. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Access the Change Password Screen:**
   - On a domain-joined and connected machine, press `Ctrl+Alt+Del`.
   - If you are in a remote session, the key combination might differ:
     - For Citrix Virtual Desktop (not in full screen): `Ctrl+F1`
     - For other clients: `Ctrl+Alt+End`

2. **Select "Change a Password":**
   - After pressing the appropriate key combination, select "Change a password" from the menu.

3. **Enter the Account Details:**
   - In the "Change a password" dialog box, enter the username of the account for which you want to change the password.
   - Enter the current password.
   - Enter the new password and confirm it.

4. **Verify the Connection:**
   - Ensure that the machine is currently connected to a domain controller. This is necessary for the password change to be processed.

By following these steps, you should be able to change the password for the second account even if you cannot log in with that account initially.
