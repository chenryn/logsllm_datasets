User: I created a droplet that runs a flask application. My question is when I ssh into the droplet and restart the apache2 server, do I have to keep the console open all the time (that is I should not shut down my computer) for the application to be live?
What if I have a dynamic application that runs scripts in the background, do I have to keep the console open all the time for the dynamic parts to work?
P.S:
there's a similar question in SO about a NodeJs app but some parts of the answer they provided are irrelevant to my Flask app.
Assistant: You needn't keep the console on, the app will still running after you close the console on your computer. But you may need to set a log to monitor it.
