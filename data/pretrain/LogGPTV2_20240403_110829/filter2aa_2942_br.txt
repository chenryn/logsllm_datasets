### Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Practices

#### Key Responsibilities
- **Verify Internal and Supply Chain C-SCRM Compliance:** Ensure that both internal processes and supply chain partners adhere to established C-SCRM standards.
- **Determine Effectiveness of C-SCRM Response:** Assess the efficacy of C-SCRM measures in mitigating identified risks.
- **Identify Internal and Supply Chain Changes:** Monitor and document any changes within the organization or its supply chain that could impact C-SCRM.

#### Integration and Monitoring
- **Integration into Operational-Level Continuous Monitoring:** Incorporate C-SCRM into the continuous monitoring activities at the operational level.
- **Regular Reporting:** Generate periodic reports as part of the continuous monitoring process.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Use reporting data to identify and address areas that require enhancement.
- **Re-assessment Triggers:** Identify new or changed constraints that necessitate a re-evaluation of risk.

#### NIST SP 800-161r1: Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations
This publication, available free of charge from [NIST](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1), provides comprehensive guidance on C-SCRM practices.

#### Supplemental Guidance
Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM considerations into their overall risk monitoring strategy. This may involve collecting information from non-traditional sources, such as open sources, suppliers, and integrators. The strategy should include:
- **Data Collection:** Specify the data to be gathered.
- **Measures Compilation:** Define specific metrics (e.g., number of contractual compliance violations).
- **Tool Assumptions:** Identify required tools for data collection.
- **Data Protection:** Outline methods for protecting collected data.
- **Reporting Formats:** Establish formats for data reporting.

Potential data sources include:
- Agency vulnerability and incident management activities.
- Manual reviews.
- Interagency information sharing.
- Information sharing with suppliers, developers, system integrators, and service providers.
- Supplier information sharing.
- Contractual reviews.

#### Data Protection and Tools
- **Supplier Data Protection:** Ensure the appropriate protection of supplier data if it is collected and stored by the agency.
- **Additional Tools:** Acquire necessary tools for data collection and analysis to effectively evaluate cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.

#### Risk Monitoring
**Task 4-2: Ongoing Monitoring**
- **Compliance Verification:** Monitor processes and supplied products/services for adherence to security and C-SCRM requirements.
- **Effectiveness Evaluation:** Assess whether the implemented security and C-SCRM measures produce the intended results.
- **Change Identification:** Detect any changes in the environment that could signal the need for updated requirements and controls.

#### Regular Reviews and Reassessment
- **Review Intervals:** Establish regular intervals for reviewing suppliers and their products/services.
- **Reassessment Triggers:** Document off-cycle triggers that would prompt a reassessment of cybersecurity risks. These triggers may include changes in policy, mission, threat environment, enterprise architecture, SDLC, or requirements.

#### Example Scenario
- **Supply Shortage:** If two key vetted suppliers announce their departure from a market, this could create a supply shortage. This event would trigger a reassessment to determine if the reduced number of suppliers introduces vulnerabilities in component availability and integrity.
- **Ownership Change:** A change in ownership, particularly involving different nationalities, can have significant implications and may necessitate a reassessment.

#### Effective Communication
- **Tailored Reporting:** Reports should be customized to meet the specific needs of the intended audience. For example, Level 1 decision-makers may receive summaries of C-SCRM implementation coverage, efficiency, effectiveness, and overall exposure to cybersecurity risks.
- **Collaborative Definition:** Reporting requirements should be defined in collaboration with the intended audience and periodically updated to ensure relevance and effectiveness.

#### Outputs and Post Conditions
- **Integration into C-SCRM Plan:** The outputs from the monitoring step should be integrated into the C-SCRM plan, providing inputs for iterative implementations of the Frame, Assess, and Respond steps.
