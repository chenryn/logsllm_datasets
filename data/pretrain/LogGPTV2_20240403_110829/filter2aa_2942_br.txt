Supplemental Guidance 
Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM considerations into their overall risk monitoring strategy. 
Monitoring cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain may require access to information 
that agencies may not have traditionally collected. Some of the information will need to be 
gathered from outside of the agency, such as from open sources, suppliers, or integrators. The 
strategy should, among other things, include the data to be collected, state the specific measures 
compiled from the data (e.g., number of contractual compliance violations by the vendor), 
identify existing assumptions about the required tools needed to collect the data, identify how the 
data will be protected, and define reporting formats for the data. Potential data sources may 
include:  
• Agency vulnerability management and incident management activities; 
• Agency manual reviews; 
• Interagency information sharing; 
• Information sharing between the agency and suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers; 
• Supplier information sharing; and 
• Contractual reviews of suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers.  
Enterprises should ensure the appropriate protection of supplier data if that data is collected and 
stored by the agency. Agencies may also require additional data collection and analysis tools to 
appropriately evaluate the data to achieve the objective of monitoring applicable cybersecurity 
risks throughout the supply chain.  
RISK MONITORING  
TASK 4-2: Monitor enterprise information systems and environments of operation on an 
ongoing basis to verify compliance, determine the effectiveness of risk response measures, and 
identify changes.  
According to [NIST SP 800-39], enterprises should monitor compliance, effectiveness, and 
change. Monitoring compliance within the context of C-SCRM involves monitoring an 
enterprise’s processes and supplied products and services for compliance with the established 
security and C-SCRM requirements. Monitoring effectiveness involves monitoring the resulting 
risks to determine whether the established security and C-SCRM requirements produce the 
intended results. Monitoring change involves monitoring the environment for any changes that 
would signal changing requirements and mitigations/controls to maintain an acceptable level of 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.  
To monitor for changes, enterprises should establish regular intervals at which they review 
suppliers and their supplied products and services. The reassessment intervals should be 
determined as needed and appropriate for the enterprise. Enterprises also need to identify and 
document a set of off-cycle triggers that would signal an alteration to the state of cybersecurity 
risks throughout the supply chain. While the categories of triggers will likely include changes to 
constraints as identified in Table D-6 (during the Frame step) – such as policy, mission, change

to the threat environment, enterprise architecture, SDLC, or requirements – the specific triggers 
within those categories may be substantially different for different enterprises.  
An example of a cybersecurity supply chain change is two key vetted suppliers75 announcing 
their departure from a specific market, therefore creating a supply shortage for specific 
components. This would trigger the need to evaluate whether reducing the number of suppliers 
could create vulnerabilities in component availability and integrity. In this scenario, a potential 
deficit of components may result from an insufficient supply of components. If none of the 
remaining suppliers are vetted, this deficit may result in the uncertain integrity of the remaining 
components. If the enterprise policy directs the use of vetted components, this event may result 
in the enterprise’s inability to fulfill its mission needs. Supply chain change may also arise as a 
result of a company experiencing a change in ownership. A change in ownership could have 
significant implications, especially in cases where the change involves a transfer of ownership to 
individuals who are citizens of a different country from that of the original owners.  
In addition to regularly updating existing risk assessments at all levels of the enterprise with the 
results of ongoing monitoring, the enterprise should determine the triggers of a reassessment. 
Some triggers may include the availability of resources, changes to cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain, natural disasters, or mission collapse.  
In order for monitoring to be effective, the state of cybersecurity supply chain risk management 
needs to be communicated to decision makers across the enterprise in the form of C-SCRM 
reporting. Reporting should be tailored to meet the specific needs of its intended audience. For 
example, reporting to Level 1 decision makers may summarize the C-SCRM implementation 
coverage, efficiency, effectiveness, and overall levels of exposure to cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain at aggregate levels across the enterprise. Where applicable and 
appropriate for the audience, reporting may focus on specific areas in Level 2 and Level 3 that 
require executive leadership attention. To aid in tailoring reporting, reporting requirements 
should be defined in collaboration with the intended audience and updated periodically to ensure 
that it remains efficient and effective.  
Outputs and Post Conditions  
Enterprises should integrate the cybersecurity supply chain outputs of the Monitor step into the 
C-SCRM plan. This plan will provide inputs into iterative implementations of the Frame, Assess, 
and Respond steps as required.  
75 A vetted supplier is one with whom the organization is comfortable doing business. This level of comfort is usually achieved 
through the development of an organization-defined set of supply chain criteria and then vetting suppliers against those criteria.

Definition 
cybersecurity compromise 
in the supply chain  
A cybersecurity incident in the supply chain (also known as 
compromise) is an occurrence within the supply chain whereby 
the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system or the 
information the system processes, stores, or transmits is 
jeopardized. A supply chain incident can occur anywhere 
during the life cycle of the system, product or service. 
cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply 
chain 
The potential for harm or compromise arising from suppliers, 
their supply chains, their products, or their services. 
Cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain arise from 
threats that exploit vulnerabilities or exposures within products 
and services traversing the supply chain as well as threats 
exploiting vulnerabilities or exposures within the supply chain 
itself. 
cybersecurity supply chain 
risk assessment 
A systematic examination of cybersecurity risks throughout 
the supply chain, likelihoods of their occurrence, and potential 
impacts. 
cybersecurity supply chain 
risk management 
A systematic process for managing exposure to cybersecurity 
risks throughout the supply chain and developing appropriate 
response strategies, policies, processes, and procedures.  
Note: For the purposes of NIST publications SCRM and C-
SCRM refer to the same concept. This is because NIST is 
addressing only the cybersecurity aspects of SCRM. Other 
organizations may use a different definition of SCRM which is 
outside the scope of this publication.  This publication does not 
address many of the non-cybersecurity aspects of SCRM.

(1976) (a fact is material “if there is a substantial likelihood

making an investment decision or if it “would have been 
viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly 
altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available” to the

2) The materiality of cybersecurity risks or incidents depends 
upon their nature, extent, and potential magnitude, particularly 
as they relate to any compromised information or the business 
and scope of company operations. The materiality of 
cybersecurity risks and incidents also depends on the range of 
harm that such incidents could cause. This includes harm to a

and vendor relationships, as well as the possibility of litigation 
or regulatory investigations or actions, including regulatory 
actions by state and federal governmental authorities and non-
