User: I have a feeling the answer is simple and documented, but I'm absolutely missing it:
Is there a way, using Python and webapp through Google App Engine, to pass the id field of a record to the template? I'm fairly new to the app engine, and yes, I have searched all around the Google Documentation to find this.
Assistant: Assuming you're using the built-in Django 0.96 templates, you can access the ID (assuming the entity has one; it might have a key name instead if you saved it with one) with {{entity.key.id}}.
