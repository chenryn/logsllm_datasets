are up to 30% faster (better) for 75.1% of preﬁxes observed in three IXPs. For
Eq-Chi, 50% of preﬁxes are at least 57.8% faster (better) via a local route than
using the remote one. On the right side, we see a similar pattern, where remote
routes have RTTs less than 30.7% lower (better) for 75.1% of preﬁxes observed
in three IXPs. The situation was diﬀerent for Reseller RP inferences for LINX.

As shown in Fig. 7b, when the remote routes via reseller had lower latency, they
were at least 20% faster for 54.6% of preﬁxes, while when the local route had
lower latency, they were at least 20% faster for only 32.5% of measured preﬁxes.
In summary, the results suggest that with proper conﬁguration and knowledge
about these cases, ASes can decide which route to select and steer their traﬃc,
potentially enabling better performance according to their speciﬁc goals.
The Path with Lowest Latency was Not Always Preferred by BGP.
Table 5 shows the percentage of preﬁxes where the route with lowest latency
would not match the route speciﬁed in a BGP tie-breaker. We observed a small
percentage of preﬁxes where the remote route had lower latency but also had
a longer AS path when compared to the local route (no more than 8.2%.). In
contrast, there were proportionally more cases of preﬁxes for which the local
route had lower latency but a longer AS path than the remote route, varying
from 28% (AMS-IX) up to 64.8% (Eq-Ash). When both the remote and local
routes had the same path length, the local peering predominantly had a latency
advantage over the remote routes despite the latency beneﬁt not being higher
than 5 ms for most routes. The results for Reseller RP, obtained from LINX,
follow a similar pattern (as in Table 5) and are omitted. In summary, the results
indicate that the shortest AS path route may often not match the route with
the lowest latency.
5.4 Do Remote Routes Have More Latency Variability than Local
Routes?
In discussion with network operators, there was a concern about potential latency
variability that could be introduced by a layer-2 connection or the geographic
distance separating the AS’s router to the IXP. To compare the relative latency
variability of remote routes over local routes, we performed active measurements
by sending at least 120 ping packets from the scamper prober at the IXP Route-
Views node to an address in each of the preﬁxes with both local and remote
routes seen in Table 4 over ≈4 days (depending on the size of the IXP): at least
60 packets via the local route and at least 60 via the remote route. We com-
puted the latency standard deviation for the best remote and local routes for
the preﬁxes we used in the latency comparison in the previous section.

(b) Reseller RP vs. Local.
Fig. 8. Latency variability to remotely announced preﬁxes via remote and local routes.
The latency variability to reach remote destinations was similar for both local and
remote routes, suggesting that reseller connections and geographical distance had lim-
ited impact on latency variability.
Remote and Local Routes had Similar Latency Variability. Figures 8a
and 8b show the latency variability was similar between remote and local routes.
Regardless of peering type or remote peering perspective, 75% of the preﬁxes
had less than 10 ms of latency variability. More speciﬁcally, for three of the four
analyzed IXPs, the same fraction of preﬁxes had latency variability below 5 ms.
The results indicate that variability was not a distinguishing feature at least for
the IXPs we considered.
6 Does Remote Peering have Lower Latency than
Transit?
When remotely announced preﬁxes do not also have routes from a local peer
at the IXP, ASes must decide between delivering their traﬃc via the remote
peer at the IXP or using a transit provider. Which connection type presents
the lower latency to reach these preﬁxes? Discussions in the network operator
community concern whether remote peering is an inferior alternative to transit
in both latency and connection stability [34,40].
To assess whether remote peering or transit had lower latency to reach
addresses in preﬁxes exclusively announced at an IXP via remote peers, we
performed traceroute measurements through the remote peers at eight IXPs,
as well as a transit provider from the same location (§6.1). We compared the
latency variability of both RP and transit to reach these remotely announced
preﬁxes (Sect. 6.2).

of preﬁxes with lower latency. For Reseller RP, in four IXPs, at least 64.9% of the
preﬁxes had lower latency via Reseller RP routes than via transit. For Geographical
RP, seven of eight IXPs had at least 57.6% of preﬁxes with lower latency via remote
peering routes than via transit.

6.1 Does Transit Oﬀer Lower Latency than Remote Peering?
We collected latency measurements to addresses in preﬁxes announced by remote
peers both using the remote routes and a transit route using a similar approach to
Sect. 5.3 – we ﬁrst identiﬁed remote preﬁxes without a local route and responsive
IP addresses in each preﬁx. We collected at least ﬁve latency samples for each
remote preﬁx using a remote peer and the transit provider.
Table 6 shows the number of probed preﬁxes per IXP, along with the con-
nection type (remote or transit) with lowest latency. Note that the number of
preﬁxes with a measurement is lower than the number of preﬁxes observed in
the routing table (Sect. 5.3), as in some cases we failed to identify a responsive
address for the preﬁx. The remote route had lower latency for most preﬁxes:
57.6% of the preﬁxes had lower latency with Geographical RP routes for seven
out of eight IXPs, and 64.9% for Reseller RP.
Remote Routes can have a Substantial Latency Advantage. Figure 9a
and 9b show the absolute latency diﬀerence for Geographical RP. Figure 9a
shows that some remote routes had latencies substantially lower than the the
transit alternative in some IXPs. In NAPAfrica, 81.4% of remote routes with
lower latency than transit had at least 40 ms lower latency. When we discussed
our results with resellers, they suggested that high IP transit prices, along with
poor ISP interconnectivity and performance in Africa, made remote peering a
lower latency and cheaper option, in line with the published literature [23,24,28].
For the remaining IXPs, the latency diﬀerence between remote routes and transit
was not substantial. Regardless of which route had lower latency, in six IXPs,
we observed that the latency diﬀerence was below 5 ms for at least 78.1% of the
measured preﬁxes.
On the Latency Impact of Remote Peering

Fig. 9. Latency diﬀerence between Geographical RP and transit provider routes mea-
sured by latency to addresses in remote preﬁxes. Remote peering had a substantial
advantage for a few IXPs (NAPAfrica, Eq-Chi), but not as a substantial advantage for
others (less than 5 ms for 78.1% of measured preﬁxes).
Figure 10a and 10b show the results for Reseller RP. Figure 10a suggests that
any latency advantage of remote peering was not substantial. For more than
67.2% of remote routes with lower latency, the latency advantage was within
1 ms. In comparison, Fig. 10b suggests that when transit was faster for three out
of four IXPs, the latency advantage was a bit higher: in at least 53.1% of transit
routes with lower latency, the advantage was more than 1 ms.
6.2 RTT Variability of Remote Preﬁxes
In Sect. 5.4, the latency variability to reach addresses using either remote or local
routes was similar. To understand if using a transit provider introduces more
latency variability, we performed ping measurements to exclusively announced
preﬁxes seen at Table 6. Similar to the previous measurements, we sent at least
120 ping probes from to each preﬁx over up to 4 days (depending on the size of
the IXP): 60 (at least) via the transit provider and 60 (at least) via the remote
route. We then computed the latency standard deviation among the ping probes
for the measurements via remote peering and transit.
Transit and Remote Peering had Similar Latency Variability. Fig-
ures 11a and 11b show the latency variability for remote peering. The latency
variability to reach preﬁxes exclusively announced at an IXP via a remote peer
was equivalent for both remote and transit. PTT-SP and Eq-Ash were the only
IXPs where a fraction of the preﬁxes had higher latency variability (see Fig. 11a).

Fig. 10. Latency diﬀerence between Reseller RP and transit measured by the latency
to reach remote preﬁxes. When Reseller RP had lower latency, the latency advantage
was not substantial (below 1 ms for over 67.2% of the measured preﬁxes). When transit
routes had lower latency, the latency advantage was a bit higher (more than 1 ms for
53.1% of the measured preﬁxes in three IXPs).
Still, for all the IXPs, the standard deviation for 75% of the preﬁxes was below
10 ms. We observed a similar trend for Reseller RP inferences, where resellers
and transit had comparable latency variability.
7 Related Work
With the growing deployment of remote peering, there have been several eﬀorts
to investigate this interconnection practice. We divide related work into two
categories: (1) methods to identify remote peering at IXPs, and (2) studies to
explore implications of remote peering on the Internet.
Inferring Remote Peering. Two main related methodologies have been pro-
posed in the literature. In 2014, Castro et al. [15] introduced a conservative
inference method based on measuring propagation delay to IXP interfaces con-
nected to it via pings. Responses to ping probes sent to IXP interfaces that pre-
sented latency more than 10 ms and whose IP-TTL had not been decremented
were classiﬁed as remote. The authors reported that 91% of the 22 studied IXPs
showed networks connecting via remote peering. Further, using ground-truth
traﬃc from a National Research and Education Network, the paper demon-
strated that a network could oﬄoad up to 25% of its transit-provider traﬃc via
remote peering.
In 2018, Nomikos et al. [42] also proposed a methodology to infer remote peer-
ing. Using ground-truth data from seven IXPs, the authors showed that latency
alone was not suﬃcient to make accurate inferences in some cases, such as IXPs
with switching fabrics distributed across diﬀerent countries. The paper proposed
combining latency measurements with additional remote peering features, such
