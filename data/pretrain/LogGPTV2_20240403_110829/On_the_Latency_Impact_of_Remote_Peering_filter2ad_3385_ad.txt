#### Performance Comparison of Remote and Local Routes
For 75.1% of the prefixes observed across three Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), local routes are up to 30% faster than remote routes. Specifically, for Eq-Chi, 50% of the prefixes are at least 57.8% faster via a local route compared to a remote one. Conversely, for 75.1% of the prefixes, remote routes have Round-Trip Times (RTTs) that are less than 30.7% lower (better) than local routes. The situation was different for Reseller RP inferences at LINX.

#### Table 5: Latency and AS Path Length Comparison
The table below breaks down the comparison between remote and local routes for each prefix in terms of latency and AS path length, focusing on Geographical RP only. A significant number of local routes had lower latency but longer AS path lengths compared to remote routes.

| IXP       | Total Prefixes | Remote Lower Latency, Longer AS Path | Remote Lower Latency, Equal AS Path | Local Lower Latency, Longer AS Path | Local Lower Latency, Equal AS Path |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| LINX      | 41,624         | 1,177 (2.8%)                          | 2,185 (5.2%)                         | 12,950 (31.1%)                      | 9,636 (23.2%)                      |
| AMS-IX    | 17,121         | 1,397 (8.2%)                          | 657 (3.8%)                           | 4,798 (28.0%)                       | 1,828 (10.7%)                      |
| Eq-Ash    | 23,791         | 270 (1.1%)                            | 674 (2.8%)                           | 161 (4.9%)                          | 9,547 (40.1%)                      |
| Eq-Chi    | 3,316          | 57 (1.7%)                             | 5,579 (23.5%)                        | 2,149 (64.8%)                       | 111 (3.3%)                         |

As shown in Figure 7b, when remote routes via resellers had lower latency, they were at least 20% faster for 54.6% of the prefixes. In contrast, when local routes had lower latency, they were at least 20% faster for only 32.5% of the measured prefixes. These results suggest that with proper configuration and knowledge, Autonomous Systems (ASes) can choose the optimal route to achieve better performance according to their specific goals.

#### BGP Route Selection
Table 5 highlights the percentage of prefixes where the route with the lowest latency did not match the route specified by BGP tie-breakers. A small percentage (no more than 8.2%) of prefixes had remote routes with lower latency but longer AS paths compared to local routes. Conversely, a higher proportion (ranging from 28% at AMS-IX to 64.8% at Eq-Ash) of prefixes had local routes with lower latency but longer AS paths. When both routes had the same path length, local peering predominantly offered a latency advantage, though the benefit was typically less than 5 ms. The results for Reseller RP at LINX follow a similar pattern and are omitted. In summary, the shortest AS path does not always correspond to the route with the lowest latency.

#### Latency Variability of Remote vs. Local Routes
In discussions with network operators, there was concern about potential latency variability introduced by Layer-2 connections or geographic distance. To compare the relative latency variability, we conducted active measurements by sending at least 120 ping packets from the scamper prober at the IXP RouteViews node to an address in each prefix over approximately four days. We computed the latency standard deviation for the best remote and local routes for the prefixes used in the previous section's latency comparison.

Figures 8a and 8b show that the latency variability was similar between remote and local routes. For 75% of the prefixes, the latency variability was less than 10 ms, and for three out of four analyzed IXPs, the variability was below 5 ms. This indicates that variability is not a distinguishing feature for the IXPs considered.

#### Latency Comparison: Remote Peering vs. Transit
When remotely announced prefixes do not have local routes at the IXP, ASes must choose between delivering traffic via the remote peer at the IXP or using a transit provider. To assess which connection type offers lower latency, we performed traceroute measurements through remote peers at eight IXPs and a transit provider from the same location.

Table 6 shows the number of prefixes with lower latency via remote peering or transit. For Reseller RP, at least 64.9% of the prefixes had lower latency via Reseller RP routes than via transit in four IXPs. For Geographical RP, seven out of eight IXPs had at least 57.6% of prefixes with lower latency via remote peering routes than via transit.

| IXP       | Reseller RP Latency | Geographical RP Latency |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| PTT-SP    | 10,342 (77.7%)      | 2,205 (28.0%)            |
| LINX      | 2,651 (57.6%)       | -                       |
| AMS-IX    | -                   | 1,787 (98.1%)            |
| NAPAfrica | -                   | 1,045 (35.1%)            |
| PTT-RJ    | -                   | -                       |
| PTT-CE    | -                   | -                       |
| Eq-Ash    | -                   | 1,190 (28.3%)            |
| Eq-Chi    | -                   | 1,740 (71.1%)            |

Remote routes often had a substantial latency advantage, particularly in NAPAfrica, where 81.4% of remote routes with lower latency had at least 40 ms lower latency than transit. For other IXPs, the latency difference was generally below 5 ms for at least 78.1% of the measured prefixes.

#### RTT Variability of Remote Prefixes
To understand if using a transit provider introduces more latency variability, we performed ping measurements to exclusively announced prefixes. The latency variability was similar for both remote peering and transit, with 75% of the prefixes having a standard deviation below 10 ms. Figures 11a and 11b show the latency variability for remote peering, indicating that neither transit nor remote peering introduced significantly more variability.

#### Related Work
With the increasing deployment of remote peering, several studies have investigated this interconnection practice. These can be categorized into two main areas: (1) methods to identify remote peering at IXPs, and (2) studies exploring the implications of remote peering on the Internet.

**Inferring Remote Peering:**
- **Castro et al. (2014):** Proposed a method based on measuring propagation delay to IXP interfaces. They found that 91% of the 22 studied IXPs showed networks connecting via remote peering, and a network could offload up to 25% of its transit-provider traffic via remote peering.
- **Nomikos et al. (2018):** Suggested combining latency measurements with additional remote peering features to improve inference accuracy, especially for IXPs with distributed switching fabrics.

These studies provide valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of remote peering, helping network operators make informed decisions.
