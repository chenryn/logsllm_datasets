#### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Can we add a feature in LinearRegression that could remove collinearity (exact
collinearity) in the data?.
#### Describe your proposed solution
My proposal is to add an extra argument like remove_collinearity if it is set
by the user then we can remove exact collinear variables using the rank of the
matrix or collinear variables using VIF. This can save some time instead of
going for Ridge regression.
