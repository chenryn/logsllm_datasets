Abstract
Current fallback authentication mechanisms are unreliable
(e.g., security questions are easy to guess) and need improve-
ment. Social authentication shows promise as a novel form of
fallback authentication. In this paper, we report the results of
a four-week study that explored people’s perceived willing-
ness to use video chat as a form of social authentication. We
investigated whether people’s mood, location, and trust, and
the presence of others affected perceived willingness to use
video chat to authenticate. We found that participants who
were alone, reported a more positive mood, and had more
trust in others reported more willingness to use video chat
as an authentication method. Participants also reported more
willingness to help others to authenticate via video chat than
to initiate a video chat authentication session themselves. Our
results provide initial insights into human-computer interac-
tion issues that could stem from using video chat as a fallback
authentication method within a small social network of people
(e.g., family members and close friends) who know each other
well and trust each other.
1 Introduction
Web services and mobile apps mostly rely on users’ self-
provided passwords for authentication. However, passwords
are easy to forget: nearly three-quarters of people report that
they often or sometimes forget a password [69]. A survey
study conducted by SAP Inc. found that over the course of 12
months, 84% of users forget a password at least once [35]. At
the same time, passwords are relatively easy to steal. Theft
of credentials happens regularly via users being phished or
users sharing the same passwords across many platforms, one
of which is compromised [7]. In both cases, users may be
forced to use a form of secondary or fallback authentication
mechanism to regain access to their accounts.
The most common secondary or fallback authentication
mechanisms are security questions and out-of-band commu-
nications, which are unreliable and/or hard to use. For se-
curity questions, previous research has shown that answers
are easy to forget and maybe guessable by users’ acquain-
tances [73, 77, 94]. Forgetting passwords, user names, and
answers to security questions are the most common reasons
for authentication failures [61]. Fallback authentication via
SMS or email is preferable to security questions in terms of
usability and security [13]. However, mobile phones are fre-
quently lost or stolen [15, 21, 80], and when this occurs, the
legitimate owner may not receive the SMS or email. For these
reasons, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) has suggested avoiding SMS or email as out-of-band
authenticators [38].
To address the risks associated with SMS and email as
out-of-band authenticators, Libonati and colleagues [60] de-
veloped a system where a phone would remain usable only
while in its owner’s possession, as conﬁrmed by the owner’s
social network members when interacting with the owner. For
example, video chatting with the owner would present an op-
portunity to notarize that the owner was still in possession of
the phone, in which case the owner’s phone would continue to
function as normal. If a sufﬁciently long time passed without
such a successful notarization, then the phone’s functionality
would be degraded, and critical capabilities (e.g., approving a
fallback authentication push notiﬁcation or checking email)
rendered unavailable until such authentication was obtained.
Alternatively, a notarization could be required to perform a
critical transaction with the device.
Attempting to involve another person to act as a notary to
conﬁrm the owner’s possession of their phone naturally raises
many questions relating to feasibility and motivation. Libon-
ati and colleagues [60] attempted to answer some of these
questions via a lab study. In their study, participants were
randomly assigned to act as either a supplicant—a person re-
questing authentication, or a notary—a person who supported
authentication. While physically separated in the lab, the no-
tary interacted with the supplicant via video chat, decided
whether the supplicant was present in a set of images, and, if
so, identiﬁed the supplicant. They found that, in the lab, no-
tarization by strangers is effective and argued that this might
be useful in combating device theft. However, their study did

not address whether video-based social authentication would
be usable by people outside the lab and over a longer period
of time. If it is, what factors may affect people’s ability and
willingness to use this form of fallback authentication?
To explore users’ perceived willingness to use video-based
social authentication, we performed a four-week-long ESM
(experience sampling method) study. The ESM study simu-
lated important aspects of the authentication process. We sent
simulated video authentication requests to participants’ mo-
bile phones and measured how participants reacted to these
simulated requests. We also measured factors like mood, lo-
cation, trust, and presence of others to see how these factors
affect people’s perceived willingness to use video authentica-
tion. In this study, we focused on the following two research
questions.
• RQ1: What is the effect of mood, location, trust, and
presence of others on people’s perceived willingness to
use video-based social authentication?
• RQ2: What are the reasons people agree or decline to
participate in simulated video-based social authentica-
tion at the moment?
To summarize, our work has three major contributions:
• Our results demonstrate people’s perceived willingness
to use video chat as a secondary or fallback social authen-
tication method, especially within a small social network
of people who know each other.
• We ﬁnd that mood, location, trust, and presence of oth-
ers are contextual factors that are associated with the
perceived willingness to use such an authentication.
• Our paper offers initial insights into human-computer
interaction issues stemming from simulated use of such
authentication and presents implications that may be use-
ful for designing and implementing video-based social
authentication systems.
2 Related Work
2.1 Fallback Authentication
2.1.1 Security questions
Security questions are widely used as a secondary or fallback
authentication mechanism when primary passwords are lost,
forgotten, or users need to recover their accounts for other
reasons. Using security questions as an authentication method
is well studied. For example, research has found that while
answers to security questions are easy to recall, about one-
third of the answers can be guessed by those who are close
to the users [94], and nearly forty percent can be guessed
by parents, partners, close friends, etc. [73]. Bank security
questions had a set of usability and security issues, including
inapplicability, ambiguity, lack of memorability, guessability,
attackability, and automatic attackability [75]. Twenty percent
of the answers to the security questions used by top webmail
providers cannot be recalled by users [77], but many can be
guessed by attackers [77]. More recently, a study conducted
by Google in 2015 about security questions revealed that it is
nearly impossible to design security questions that are both
secure and memorable [13]. Based on these results, some
best-practice suggestions favor more reliable alternatives for
fallback authentication [13].
2.1.2 Out-of-band communications
One popular alternative to security questions is the use of out-
of-band communication such as SMS or email. Using SMS or
email as fallback authentication is considered more secure, re-
liable, and preferable to security questions by big tech compa-
nies such as Google [13]. Beyond that preference, SMS is also
preferred over email because people often use the same pass-
word for their primary account and recovery email, and some
email providers recycle inactive email addresses [13]. How-
ever, using SMS for fallback authentication is also risky due
to the security and privacy vulnerabilities of mobile phones
and SMS. SMS authentication messages often include the
name of the application for which the message was intended,
which may risk compromising users’ accounts [89]. For these
reasons, the National Institutes of Standards and Technol-
ogy deprecated SMS as an out-of-band veriﬁcation method,
though they have recently softened this guidance [38].
Furthermore, mobile phones are frequently lost or stolen.
For example, in the U.S., 31% of mobile phone owners have
had their mobile phone lost or stolen, and 12% of them have
had another person access their phone in a way that they
felt their privacy was invaded [15]. Current solutions such
as Google’s ‘Find your phone’ [37] and Apple’s ‘Find my
iPhone’ service [4] inadequately protect the data on devices
since they can be disabled or hacked by others [62, 78, 90].
Moreover, the protection offered by these services is reactive,
meaning the data on the device remains vulnerable until users
realize their devices are stolen or lost and then take actions to
lock them.
2.2 Social Authentication
Social authentication, which is deﬁned as “the direct or indi-
rect utilization of social knowledge or trust relationships in
human-computer authentication systems deployed in online
or ofﬂine contexts” [2], has been shown to be a promising fall-
back authentication mechanism. For example, Schechter and
colleagues designed, built, and tested a social authentication
system for Windows Live ID and found that about 90% of
participants who made the effort to call trustees successfully
authenticated [77]. This form of social authentication can be
improved by adding multi-level social networks to automate
2    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
the process [93]. Another social authentication protocol used
mobile phones to issue and use tokens to authenticate [83].
Facebook launched its trustee-based social authentication sys-
tem called Trusted Friends to recover locked accounts in 2011
and redesigned it to Trusted Contacts in 2013 [28]. The re-
designed Facebook social authentication system added a layer
to ask users to verify information and interactions about their
social contacts to enhance security [50]. However, Facebook’s
Trusted Contacts was found to have a number of security
risks [51]. Also based on Facebook, Yardi and colleagues
designed and built a photo-based web authentication frame-
work [91]. In this social authentication system, users verify
others with tagged user photos in a group. Besides photos,
social authentication can also use videos to verify users’ iden-
tity. Sherman and colleagues found that most (68%) of the
participants chose video veriﬁcation over photo ID cards and
voter ID cards in terms of the accuracy in verifying individ-
uals for voting [81]. Moreover, they found that most of the
participants (74%) said they are willing or very willing to
participate in video veriﬁcation [81].
Another form of social authentication that could be used for
fallback authentication is device notarization (DNo), which
has inspired the study here. DNo was suggested as a way to
allow users to proactively maintain and improve the security
of their mobile devices [60]. DNo employs human-mediated,
crowdsourced biometric authentication as a potential solution
to the problem of remote authentication. In this system, a
person from the crowd (the notary) conﬁrms that the current
device user (the supplicant) is, in fact, the device owner via a
short video chat. Similarly, Shropshire and Menard proposed
an approach using videos and trusted contacts as a form of
fallback authentication [82]. In their approach, the suppli-
cant uploads a video to the server. Then the notary conﬁrms
the identity of the supplicant by viewing the video from a
text message. Video-based authentication may be suitable
for protecting data of users deemed highly vulnerable or for
high-value transactions, such as moving money between bank
accounts. For example, using live video for authentication has
recently been explored by the banking industry for high-value
transactions [12]. In addition to other forms of video authen-
tication, uploading a short video during enrollment [42] is
currently being explored. While notarization is not expected
to be used for frequent actions such as unlocking a phone
because it would be too cumbersome, it could be effective for
rare transactions such as password recovery [60]. Libonati
and colleagues [60] also discussed potential privacy risks for
both supplicant and notary and outlined the steps taken in
their design to minimize those risks.
To date, DNo and most other social authentication systems
have only been tested in lab settings. In the ﬁeld, many exter-
nal factors may affect the efﬁciency and the reliability of a
social authentication system. For video-based social authenti-
cation, factors such as mood [72], location [74], trust [14], and
presence of others [16] may affect users’ perceived willing-
ness to use it in the ﬁeld. Therefore, in this work, we explore
these issues in research questions RQ1 and RQ2.
3 Method
Our study had three steps. First, participants completed a pre-
survey. Next, we used the experience sampling method [58]
to collect data over four weeks from 30 participants. Finally,
participants completed a post-survey. We organize our meth-
ods in the following ﬁve sub-sections: recruitment and par-
ticipants, pre-survey, experience sampling, post-survey, and
ethical considerations.
3.1 Recruitment and Participants
We advertised our study as “a study that uses video chat as an
alternative form of authentication, instead of using passwords
or security questions, for example.” We recruited participants
in two phases. First, we recruited participants via social media,
ﬂyers, and word of mouth. Then, since we wanted to recruit
participants who already knew each other, we used snowball
sampling, where existing participants suggest possible future
participants from among their acquaintances [36]. Participants
who expressed interest in joining our study were asked to pro-
vide the email address of one to ten individuals from their
social network who might also be interested in our study. Sub-
sequently, we invited all these individuals to participate via
email that included a pre-survey. Participants were required to
participate in the study together with at least one person they
knew prior to the study. As a result, 36 people accepted our
initial invitation and were qualiﬁed to participate in the study.
Among these 36 participants, two participants had technical
issues with their mobile phones, and four participants dropped
out of the study after the pre-survey. Thus, 30 participants
who owned at least one smartphone completed the study, and
their data were used in later analysis. See Section 4.1 below
for additional information about our participants. Each partic-
ipant was awarded a $40 gift card after the completion of the
study.
3.2 Pre-survey
The pre-survey (see Appendix A) had questions covering de-
mographic items (including gender, age, race, income, and
education) as well as mobile app usage and the perceived
sensitivity of data captured by those apps. Participants were
asked to list at least ﬁve and up to ten of their most frequently
used mobile apps. Two questions adapted from those used by
Gibbs, Ellison, and Lai [34] were added to allow us to catego-
rize the applications in terms of data sensitivity from low to
medium to high. The pre-survey also asked whether partici-
pants currently use PINs to lock their phones, whether they
have ever used video chat before, and how many hours per
week they spend on video chatting. Participants were asked
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    3
to list at least one and up to ten individuals from their social
network who may also be interested in participating in the
study with them. This list was not limited to close relations
(e.g., family, friends) but could also include weak ones (e.g.,
strangers). We also requested that each participant upload a
photo of themselves, which we used later in the ESM question-
naire. Finally, participants responded to a trust question about
each individual they listed. Trust was assessed via an adapted
version of a validated interpersonal trust scale [53]. Trust was
categorized as low, medium, or high using this scale.
3.3 Experience Sampling
3.3.1 The experience sampling method
We used the experience sampling method (ESM) [58] in our
study. Using ESM, participants are prompted to provide sys-
tematic self-reports (e.g., answers to questionnaires) about
events as they occur throughout daily life [24]. One major
advantage of ESM is it does not require participants to recall
anything, which minimizes the effects of reliance on memory
and reconstruction. Instead, it asks about participants’ cur-
rent activities and feelings [24]. ESM data may, therefore, be
more reliable than data that must be recalled, because it is less
susceptible to subject recall errors than other self-report feed-
back elicitation methods [26]. It is particularly well-suited
and widely used for ubiquitous computing [24] and mobile
device studies [10].
3.3.2 Group
We used the social network information participants provided
in the pre-survey to form social networks for the purpose
of the study. We placed six participants together in a group,
which resulted in ﬁve groups total. Each group had some
participants who knew each other and some participants who
did not know each other prior to the study (i.e., strangers).
We ﬁrst paired the participants who already knew each other.
Then we randomly placed these pairs in ﬁve groups to make
sure there were both strangers and known people for every
participant. As a result, two groups had three participants
who knew each other, and the other three participants were
strangers. The other three groups had two participants who
knew each other, and the other four participants were strangers.
We created groups consisting of both strangers and people
who knew one another, so we could measure if trust in the
person will affect people’s willingness to use a video-based
social authentication system. The same adapted version of
the validated interpersonal trust scale [53] was used again to
