I have this use case right now:
  * with flutter command -> can't run app in debug cause of multidex
  * with Android studio -> run without problem because for debug version it enable multidex by default
So I'm basically force to enable multidex just to be able to run the app in
debug from a Flutter project. Flutter should be able to have the same behavior
to avoid enabling multidex for nothing.
