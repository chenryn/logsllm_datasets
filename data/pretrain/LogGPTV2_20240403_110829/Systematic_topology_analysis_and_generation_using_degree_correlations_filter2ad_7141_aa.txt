ABSTRACT
Researchers have proposed a variety of metrics to measure
important graph properties, for instance, in social, biologi-
cal, and computer networks. Values for a particular graph
metric may capture a graph’s resilience to failure or its rout-
ing eﬃciency. Knowledge of appropriate metric values may
inﬂuence the engineering of future topologies, repair strate-
gies in the face of failure, and understanding of fundamen-
tal properties of existing networks. Unfortunately, there are
typically no algorithms to generate graphs matching one or
more proposed metrics and there is little understanding of
the relationships among individual metrics or their appli-
cability to diﬀerent settings. We present a new, system-
atic approach for analyzing network topologies. We ﬁrst
introduce the dK-series of probability distributions speci-
fying all degree correlations within d-sized subgraphs of a
given graph G. Increasing values of d capture progressively
more properties of G at the cost of more complex represen-
tation of the probability distribution. Using this series, we
can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs
and construct random graphs that accurately reproduce vir-
tually all metrics proposed in the literature. The nature of
the dK-series implies that it will also capture any future
metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we con-
struct graphs for d = 0, 1, 2, 3 and demonstrate that these
graphs reproduce, with increasing accuracy, important prop-
erties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We ﬁnd
that the d = 2 case is suﬃcient for most practical purposes,
while d = 3 essentially reconstructs the Internet AS- and
router-level topologies exactly. We hope that a systematic
method to analyze and synthesize topologies oﬀers a signif-
icant improvement to the set of tools available to network
topology and protocol researchers.

INTRODUCTION
Knowledge of network topology is crucial for understand-
ing and predicting the performance, robustness, and scala-
bility of network protocols and applications. Routing and
searching in networks, robustness to random network fail-
ures and targeted attacks, the speed of worms spreading,
and common strategies for traﬃc engineering and network
management all depend on the topological characteristics of
a given network.
Research involving network topology, particularly Inter-
net topology, generally investigates the following questions:
1. generation: can we eﬃciently generate ensembles of
random but “realistic” topologies by reproducing a set
of simple graph metrics?
2. simulations: how does some (new) protocol or appli-
cation perform on a set of these “realistic” topologies?
3. evolution: what are the forces driving the evolution
(growth) of a given network?
Figure 1 illustrates the methodologies used to answer these
questions in its left, bottom, and right parts, respectively.
Common to all of the methodologies is a set of practically-
important graph properties used for analyzing and compar-
ing sets of graphs at the center box of the ﬁgure. Many such
properties have been deﬁned and explored in the literature.
We brieﬂy discuss some of them in Section 2. Unfortunately,
there are no known algorithms to construct random graphs
with given values of most of these properties, since they
typically characterize the global structure of the topology,
making it diﬃcult or impossible to algorithmically reproduce
them.
This paper introduces a ﬁnite set of reproducible graph
properties, the dK-series, to describe and constrain random
graphs in successively ﬁner detail. In the limit, these prop-
erties describe any given graph completely. In our model, we
make use of probability distributions, the dK-distributions,
on the subgraphs of size d in some given input graph. We
call dK-graphs the sets of graphs constrained by given val-
ues of dK-distributions. Producing a family of 0K-graphs
for a given input graph requires reproducing only the average
node degree of the original graph, while producing a family
of 1K-graphs requires reproducing the original graph’s node
degree distribution, the 1K-distribution. 2K-graphs repro-
duce the joint degree distribution, the 2K-distribution, of
the original graph —the probability that two nodes of de-
grees k and k(cid:2)
are connected. 3K-graphs consider intercon-
nectivity among triples of nodes, and so forth. Generally,
the set of (d + 1)K-graphs is a subset of dK-graphs.
In
other words, larger values of d further constrain the num-
ber of possible graphs. Overall, larger values of d capture
increasingly complex properties of the original graph. How-
ever, generating dK-graphs for large values of d also become
increasingly computationally complex.
A key contribution of this paper is to deﬁne the series
of dK-graphs and dK-distributions and to employ them for
generating and analyzing network topologies. Speciﬁcally,
we develop and implement new algorithms for constructing
2K- and 3K-graphs—algorithms to generate 0K- and 1K-
graphs are already known. For a variety of measured and
modeled Internet AS- and router-level topologies, we ﬁnd
that reproducing their 3K-distributions is suﬃcient to ac-
curately reproduce all graph properties we have encountered
so far.
Our initial experiments suggest that the dK-series has
the potential to deliver two primary beneﬁts. First, it can
serve as a basis for classiﬁcation and uniﬁcation of a vari-
ety of graph metrics proposed in the literature. Second, it
establishes a path towards construction of random graphs
matching any complex graph properties, beyond the sim-
ple per-node properties considered by existing approaches
to network topology generation.

IMPORTANT TOPOLOGY METRICS
In this section we outline a list of graph metrics that have
been found important in the networking literature. This
list is not complete, but we believe it is suﬃciently diverse
and comprehensive to be used as a good indicator of graph
similarity in subsequent sections. In addition, our primary
concern is how accurately we can reproduce important met-
rics. One can ﬁnd statistical analysis of these metrics for
Internet topologies in [30] and, more recently, in [20].
The spectrum of a graph is the set of eigenvalues of its
Laplacian L. The matrix elements of L are Lij = Lji =
−1/(kikj)1/2 if there is a link between a ki-degree node i
and a kj-degree node j, and 0 otherwise. All the eigenvalues
lie between 0 and 2. Of particular importance are the small-
est non-zero and largest eigenvalues, λ1 and λn−1, where n
is the graph size. These eigenvalues provide tight bounds
for a number of critical network characteristics [8] including
network resilience [29] and network performance [19], i.e.,
the maximum traﬃc throughput of the network.
The distance distribution d(x) is the number of pairs of
nodes at a distance x, divided by the total number of pairs n2
(self-pairs included). This metric is a normalized version
of expansion [29].
It is also important for evaluating the
performance of routing algorithms [18] as well as of the speed
with which worms spread in a network.
Betweenness is the most commonly used measure of cen-
trality, i.e., topological importance, both for nodes and links.
It is a weighted sum of the number of shortest paths pass-
ing through a given node or link. As such, it estimates the
potential traﬃc load on a node or link, assuming uniformly
distributed traﬃc following shortest paths. Metrics such as
link value [29] or router utilization [19] are directly related
to betweenness.
Perhaps the most widely known graph property is the node
degree distribution P (k), which speciﬁes the probability of
nodes having degree k in a graph. The unexpected ﬁnding
in [13] that degree distributions in Internet topologies closely
follow power laws stimulated further interest in topology
research.
The likelihood S [19] is the sum of products of degrees
of adjacent nodes. It is linearly related to the assortativity
coeﬃcient r [25] suggested as a summary statistic of node
interconnectivity: assortative (disassortative) networks are
those where nodes with similar (dissimilar) degrees tend to
be tightly interconnected. They are more (less) robust to
both random and targeted removals of nodes and links. Li
et al. use S in [19] as a measure of graph randomness to show
that router-level topologies are not “very random”: instead,
they are the result of sophisticated engineering design.

Clustering C(k) is a measure of how close neighbors of
the average k-degree node are to forming a clique: C(k) is
the ratio of the average number of links between the neigh-
bors of k-degree nodes to the maximum number of such
If two neighbors of a node are connected, then
links
these three nodes form a triangle (3-cycle). Therefore, by
deﬁnition, C(k) is the average number of 3-cycles involv-
ing k-degree nodes. Bu and Towsley [4] employ clustering
to estimate accuracy of topology generators. More recently,
Fraigniaud [14] ﬁnds that a wide class of searching/routing
strategies are more eﬃcient on strongly clustered networks.

dK-SERIES AND dK-GRAPHS
There are several problems with the graph metrics in the
previous section. First, they derive from a wide range of
studies, and no one has established a systematic way to de-
termine which metrics should be used in a given scenario.
Second, there are no known algorithms capable of construct-
ing graphs with desired values for most of the described
metrics, save degree distribution and more recently, cluster-
ing [27]. Metrics such as spectrum, distance distribution,
and betweenness characterize global graph structure, while
known approaches to generating graphs deal only with local,
per-node statistics, such as the degree distribution. Third,
this list of metrics is incomplete. In particular, it cannot in-
clude any future metrics that may be of interest. Identifying

such a metric might result in ﬁnding that known synthetic
graphs do not match this new metric’s value: moving along
the loops in Figure 1 can thus continue forever.
To address these problems, we focus on establishing a ﬁ-
nite set of mutually related properties that can form a basis
for any topological graph study. More precisely, for any
graph G, we wish to identify a series of graph properties
Pd, d = 0, 1, . . ., satisfying the following requirements:
1. constructibility: we can construct graphs having these
properties;
2. inclusion: any property Pd subsumes all properties Pi
with i = 0, . . . , d − 1: that is, a graph having prop-
erty Pd is guaranteed to also have all properties Pi
for i < d;
3. convergence: as d increases, the set of graphs having
property Pd “converges” to G: that is, there exists
a value of index d = D such that all graphs having
property PD are isomorphic to G.
In the rest of this section, we establish our construction of
the properties Pd, which we will call the dK-series. We be-
gin with the observation that the most basic properties of a
network topology characterize its connectivity. The coarsest
connectivity property is the average node degree ¯k = 2m/n,
where n = |V | and m = |E| are the numbers of nodes and
links in a given graph G(V, E). Therefore, the ﬁrst prop-
erty P0 in our dK-series Pd is that the graph’s average de-
gree ¯k has the same value as in the given graph G. In Fig-
ure 2 we schematically depict the set of all graphs having
property P0 as 0K-graphs, deﬁning the largest circle. Gen-
eralizing, we adopt the term dK-graphs to represent the set
of all graphs having property Pd.
The P0 property tells us the average number of links per
node, but it does not tell us the distribution of degrees
across nodes. In particular, we do not know the number of
nodes n(k) of each degree k in the graph. We deﬁne property
P1 to capture this information: P1 is therefore the property
that the graph’s node degree distribution P (k) = n(k)/n1
1Sacriﬁcing a certain amount of rigor, we interchangeably
has the same form as in the given graph G.
It is conve-
nient to call P (k) the 1K-distribution. P1 implies at least
as much information about the network as P0, but not vice
kP (k). P1 provides more
versa: given P (k), we ﬁnd ¯k =
information than P0, and it is therefore a more restrictive
metric: the set of 1K-graphs is a subset of the set of 0K-
graphs. Figure 2 illustrates this inclusive relationship by
drawing the set of 1K-graphs inside the set of 0K-graphs.
Continuing to d = 2, we note that the degree distri-
bution constrains the number of nodes of each degree in
the network, but it does not describe the interconnectiv-
ity of nodes with given degrees. That is, it does not pro-
vide any information on the total number m(k, k(cid:2)
) of links
between nodes of degree k and k(cid:2)
. We deﬁne the third
property P2 in our series as the property that the graph’s
joint degree distribution (JDD) has the same form as in
the given graph G. The JDD, or the 2K-distribution, is
P (k1, k2) = m(k1, k2)μ(k1, k2)/(2m), where μ(k1, k2) is 2 if
k1 = k2 and 1 otherwise. The JDD describes degree corre-
lations for pairs of connected nodes. Given P (k1, k2), we
can calculate P (k) = (¯k/k)
), but not vice versa.
Consequently, the set of 2K-graphs is a subset of the 1K-
graphs. Therefore, Figure 2 depicts the smaller 2K-graph
circle inside 1K.

We can continue to increase the amount of connectivity in-
formation by considering degree correlations among greater
numbers of connected nodes. To move beyond 2K, we must
begin to distinguish the various geometries that are possi-
ble in interconnecting d nodes. To introduce P3, we require
the following two components: 1) wedges: chains of 3 nodes
connected by 2 edges, called the P∧(k1, k2, k3) component;
and 2) triangles: cliques of 3 nodes, called the P(cid:4)(k1, k2, k3)
component:
As the two geometries occur with diﬀerent frequencies among
nodes having diﬀerent degrees, we require a separate proba-
bility distribution for each conﬁguration. We call these two
components taken together the 3K-distribution.
For P4, we need the above six distributions: where instead
of indices ∧,(cid:3) we use for d = 3, we have all non-isomorphic
graphs of size 4 numbered by 1, . . . , 6. We note that the
order of k-arguments generally matters, although we can
permute any pair of arguments corresponding to pairs of
use the enumeration of nodes having some property in a
given graph, e.g., n(k)/n, with the probability that a node
has this property in a graph ensemble, e.g., P (k). The two
become identical when n → ∞; see [3] for further details.
nodes whose swapping leaves the graph isomorphic. For
example: P∧(k1, k2, k3) (cid:6)= P∧(k2, k1, k3) (cid:6)= P∧(k1, k3, k2),
but P∧(k1, k2, k3) = P∧(k3, k2, k1).
In the following ﬁgure, we illustrate properties Pd, d =
0, . . . , 4, calculated for a given graph G of size 4, where
for simplicity, values of all distributions P are the total
numbers of corresponding subgraphs, i.e., P (2, 3) = 2 means
that G contains 2 edges between 2- and 3-degree nodes.
Generalizing, we deﬁne the dK-distributions to be degree
