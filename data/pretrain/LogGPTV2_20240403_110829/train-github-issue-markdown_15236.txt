# Feature request
Request to add the documentation on how to add routes dynamically in Router
array in server.js or any other appropriate place when an API call can be
made.  
I would like to avoid custom server and stay with Next.js defaults.
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I have some urls like following.
    http://ww.example.com/something/   -> somePage.js
    http://ww.example.com/something/hello/hi   -> somePage.js
    http://ww.example.com/xyz/hello/hi   -> somePage.js
    http://ww.example.com/abc/hello/hi   -> otherPage.js
    http://ww.example.com/abc/dfg   -> otherPage.js
    http://ww.example.com/water  -> otherPage.js
    http://ww.example.com/toys  -> anyPage.js
The issue is that none of the URLs have any info about the Page that they need
to map to. Also they don't follow any pattern.
All the example I found have page info in the url like this `/post/[id]` or
`/post/postName`, so it becomes easier to identify the page the url map to but
in my case page info or any other hint is not there.
## Describe the solution you'd like
I want to add the above url mappings that can go to any number in future but
at present I have something like 300 urls.
I would like to add all urls as routes to page mappings in routes array, as
shown in pic.

I found the following code in Next.js source code:
    /// 
    import { IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from 'http';
    import { UrlWithParsedQuery } from 'url';
    export declare const route: (path: string) => (pathname: string | undefined, params?: any) => any;
    export declare type Params = {
        [param: string]: any;
    };
    export declare type RouteMatch = (pathname: string | undefined) => false | Params;
    export declare type Route = {
        match: RouteMatch;
        fn: (req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse, params: Params, parsedUrl: UrlWithParsedQuery) => void;
    };
    export default class Router {
        routes: Route[];
        constructor(routes?: Route[]);
        add(route: Route): void;
        match(req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse, parsedUrl: UrlWithParsedQuery): (() => void) | undefined;
    }
_This code declares Route but I am not sure how do I create a new Route and
add it to routes array so routing happens automatically._  
_I would like to add all the routes to routes array at the server start-up and
update them after a set interval._
## Describe alternatives you've considered
At present I have something like following working, on server side:
    app.prepare().then(() => {
      createServer((req, res) => {
        // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.
        // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.
        const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true);
        const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl;
        if (urlMappings.includes(pathname)) {
          // the path value should be externalized later.
          // So mappings can changed without redeploying the app.
          //Current pathname passed as query param to mypage.
          app.render(req, res, '/mypage', { ...query, newQueryParam: pathname });
        } else {
          handle(req, res, parsedUrl);
        }
      }).listen(port, err => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(`> Ready on http://localhost:${port}`);
      });
    });
  * The problem with this approach is that I have to maintain large array and do if-else in server.js.
  * Also the routes can not be updated if new pages are added to URL array.
  * `if (urlMappings.includes(pathname)) {`
On Client Side I am able to utilize `Link` component `as` feature to change
the displayed link in browser.
Other approach I am thinking of is to make an api call in server.js to get url
to page mapping but thats expensive as it added some time to each request.
## Additional context
Is there any way to ask Next.js that if this url maps to any of its page, if
it maps I will let Next.js handle the request, else I can check in url array
and do custom mappings to page, so I dont check url array for all valid
requests that map to pages directly ?
I asked similar question on stackoverflow and Spectrum but have not received
any response. So this is my last place to ask for help. I am new to JS or TS,
still building the understanding on how they work. Thanks in advance.
