## Overview
**Part 1: Migrating the Database**

### The Workshop
This workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive guide on migrating from Oracle Database to PostgreSQL. Part 1 focuses on the database migration process.

#### Important Note
PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) with roots in the 1980s at UC Berkeley. It has been developed as a community project since 1996. The project's goal is to develop the most advanced open-source enterprise-class RDBMS. Its SQL implementation strongly conforms to the ANSI-SQL:2008 standard.

It is important to note that PostgreSQL is not a drop-in replacement for Oracle Database. If you need such a solution, you should consider other options.

### Getting to Know Oracle Database

#### Get Your Own Instance
The two quickest ways to get your own Oracle instance running are:
1. **Oracle Database Express Edition (XE)**: 
   - Free to use (check the license terms).
   - Limited to using 1 core, 1 GB RAM, and up to 11 GB of user data.
   - Requires a free OTN account for download.
   - Recommended to run on CentOS.
   - Download version 11.2 (~300 MB .rpm) from the official site.

2. **Oracle Database Standard Edition One (SE) on AWS**:
   - Can be run as a managed service on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
   - Available in a "license included model" where the license cost is included in the AWS cost.
   - Charged by the hour (extra cost starts at ~2 cents/hour more than for a free RDBMS).
   - Limited by the SE One license to at most 16 logical cores per instance, but no limits on RAM or disk size.
   - See the AWS website for details.

#### Manuals
Oracle provides two introductory manuals:
- **2 Day DBA**
- **2 Day Developer's Guide**

These can be a good starting point, but depending on your background, additional reading may be necessary. Being a DBA in the Oracle world can be challenging, but you don't need full DBA skills if you're just supporting migrations or using XE or SE as a service.

#### Tools
- **SQL*Plus**: Traditional command-line tool bundled with Oracle XE or available in the "instant client" package.
- **Oracle SQL Developer**: Official GUI tool, a Java application available for download (~300 MB). Both tools are free and available for Linux and other operating systems.

### Getting to Know PostgreSQL

#### Get Your Own Instance
1. **Standard Repository Installation**:
   - PostgreSQL is available in the standard repositories of all major Linux distributions.
   - Use commands like `yum install postgresql postgresql-server` or `apt-get install postgresql-client postgresql`.
   - However, major Linux distributions often carry outdated versions or package the product in unusual ways.

2. **Official Download Page**:
   - For more recent releases, visit the official download page.
   - The project maintains its own repositories for all major Linux distributions, allowing you to use `yum`, `apt`, etc., for installation and updates.
   - PostgreSQL issues a major version about once a year and supports it for five years.
   - Compiling from source is also possible, though not recommended for new users.
   - PostgreSQL is also available as a managed service on AWS.

#### Manuals
- The official (comprehensive) manual is available online or as a PDF.
- Many good books are available; ensure they cover version 9.1 or newer (published after 2012).
- Attending the second part of this workshop is a great way to get started with PostgreSQL.

#### Tools
- **psql**: Traditional command-line tool available from your Linux distribution's repository or the PostgreSQL repository.
- There is no official GUI tool, but popular choices include pgAdmin (open-source), proprietary multi-product tools, and psql itself.
- I recommend using psql.

### Hands-on Setup

### Talking with an RDBMS

#### 1. Network Communication
- When using an RDBMS, you interact with it over a network socket rather than directly with files.
- **Oracle**:
  - Uses the proprietary "TNS" protocol with the default TCP port 1521.
  - OCI library as the native call interface.
- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Uses its own "frontend/backend" protocol with the default TCP port 5432.
  - libpq library as the native call interface.
- These protocols and libraries have nothing in common.

#### 2. Structured Query Language (SQL)
- SQL is used to define the database schema (DDL statements), manipulate data (DML statements), and query data.
- Information about the database schema is stored in the "catalog," which can also be queried using SQL.
- The ANSI SQL standard covers many, but not all, aspects of SQL.

#### 3. Application Interactions
- Most applications written for Oracle Database use higher-level APIs like ODBC (Win/C++), JDBC (Java), and the .NET data provider API (C#) instead of TNS/OCI.
- Drivers for these APIs are also available for PostgreSQL.
- Ideally, migrating an application that uses SQL over JDBC, for example, should not be too difficult, though there may be some challenges.

### Example Application
- A simple web application written in Java that displays countries from the "hr"-sample database.
