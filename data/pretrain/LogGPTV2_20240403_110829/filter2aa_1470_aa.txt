This talk 
Demystifying mainframes 
Basics of z/OS 
Customer Information Control System (CICS) 
Hacking CICS 
@ayoul3__ 
© WAVESTONE 
10 
Quick intro to mainframe Z 
Main OS on IBM Z Series is called z/OS (v1.14 and v2.2) 
Need a 3270 emulator (x3270, wc3270) to interact remotely 
with a Mainframe 
TN3270 is heavily based on telnet and is supported by Wireshark

11 
What we need to know about z/OS 
VTAM: Virtual Telecommunication Access Method 
TSO: Time Sharing option 
JES: JOB Entry System 
OMVS: Open MVS 
RACF: Resource Access Control Facility 
@ayoul3__

12 
VTAM is the software driver that handles TCPIP sessions (and SNA) 
Most likely the first thing you see when connecting to the 
mainframe 
Runs on port 23, 992, 5023, etc. 
Gives access to most applications hosted on the Mainframe 
Each application has a max-8 character identifier 
TIP: if you want to know if you’ re on VTAM type: IBM ECHO. It should return 
123456789ABCDEFGH… 
VTAM 
Virtual Telecommunication Access Method

TSO is the the equivalent of a shell on z/OS 
Used to execute commands, browse files, etc. 
TSO 
Time sharing option

16 
Every program on z/OS is run as a JOB 
JCL is the ‘scripting’ language used to write a JOB on 
Mainframe 
JOBs are queued in JES which decides which one to run 
depending on the JOB’s priority 
JES 
JOB Entry System

Unix System Services 
USS 
@ayoul3__ 
© WAVESTONE 
19 
USS stands for Unix System services 
Every z/OS has a UNIX running on it (since 2001) 
It implements TCP/IP  stack, handles HTTP, FTP, JAVA… 
Can be accessed directly via open telnet port (1023) or 
with OMVS command from TSO

RACF 
Resource Access Control Facility 
RACF is the core security system on z/OS 
It is the database that holds all secrets (passwords, certificates, 
cipher keys, etc.) 
Controls every resource access, privilege escalation, execution, 
authentication 
RACF is a product of IBM. Other security systems like TopSecret or 
ACF2 may be used instead of RACF

Ok then, pentest this…

23 
And then there was CICS… 
Customer Information Control System 
CICS is a combination Wordpress and Apache…before it 
was cool (around 1968) 
Current version is CICS TS 5.3

API in COBOL/C/Java  
Handles cache, concurrence access, 
etc. 
Uniform rendering of the screen 
Easily thousands of request/sec
