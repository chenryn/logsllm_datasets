## Abstract
Understanding user behavior on social networking sites is crucial for improving interface design, conducting richer studies of social interactions, and enhancing content distribution systems. This paper presents a pioneering analysis of user workloads in online social networks (OSNs) using detailed clickstream data collected over a 12-day period. The dataset includes HTTP sessions from 37,024 users who accessed four popular OSNs: Orkut, MySpace, Hi5, and LinkedIn. The data were gathered from a Brazilian social network aggregator that allows users to connect to multiple OSNs with a single authentication. Our analysis reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as connection frequency, session duration, and the types and sequences of activities users engage in. Additionally, we crawled the social network topology of Orkut to analyze user interactions in the context of the social graph. Our findings highlight the importance of clickstream data in identifying patterns in social network workloads and social interactions. Browsing, which accounts for 92% of all user activities, cannot be inferred from publicly available data, thus emphasizing the need to consider silent interactions like browsing friends' pages.

## 1. Introduction
Online social networks (OSNs) have become an integral part of the global online experience. According to Nielsen Online's latest research, social media has surpassed email as the most popular online activity, with more than two-thirds of the global online population visiting and participating in social networks and blogs. These platforms allow users to connect, share content, and disseminate information. Understanding user behavior on these sites is essential for several reasons:
1. Evaluating system performance and improving site design.
2. Conducting social studies and viral marketing.
3. Designing next-generation Internet infrastructure and content distribution systems.

Despite the potential benefits, little is known about the workloads of social networks. Previous studies have focused on visible artifacts like messages and comments, but they do not provide a comprehensive view of user activities. Clickstream data, which capture both visible and silent interactions, offer a more accurate and comprehensive picture of OSN workloads.

In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind analysis of OSN workloads based on a clickstream dataset collected from a social network aggregator. We conducted three sets of analyses:
1. Characterizing traffic and session patterns.
2. Developing a clickstream model to characterize user activities.
3. Analyzing user interactions within the social graph of Orkut.

Our findings include:
1. Heavy-tailed session durations, indicating large variations in OSN usage.
2. Browsing as the most dominant behavior, accounting for 92% of all activities.
3. A significant increase in the number of friends a user interacts with when considering silent interactions.
4. Significant exposure to friends who are 2 or more hops away in the social graph.

## 2. Dataset
We use two datasets: a clickstream dataset from a social network aggregator and the Orkut social network topology. These datasets provide complementary information, allowing us to correlate user activities with the social graph.

### 2.1 Clickstream Data
#### 2.1.1 Social Network Aggregators
Social network aggregators pull content from multiple OSNs into a single interface, making it easier for users to manage their profiles. Users can access their OSN accounts through a common interface without logging in separately. The interaction involves a two-level real-time HTTP connection: between the user and the aggregator, and between the aggregator and the OSNs.

#### 2.1.2 Data Description
The clickstream data were collected over a 12-day period (March 26 to April 6, 2009). The dataset includes 4,894,924 HTTP requests, summarizing time stamps, HTTP status, IP addresses, login IDs, URLs, session cookies, and traffic bytes. After filtering, 4,649,595 valid HTTP requests remained, grouped into 77,407 sessions. The dataset covers 16,175 distinct user IP addresses and 37,137 distinct login IDs. Of the HTTP requests, 802,574 (17%) were related to accessing Orkut, Hi5, MySpace, and LinkedIn, with Orkut accounting for 98% of the requests.

#### 2.1.3 Data Anonymization
Sensitive information was anonymized to protect user identities. This includes user login IDs, user IDs in the OSN, and content IDs.

### 2.2 Social Network Topology of Orkut
To gain insights into user behaviors over the social graph, we crawled Orkut, focusing on the 36,309 users in the clickstream dataset. The average number of friends was 211.4, with a median of 152. The user with the highest number had 998 friends. The IDs in the crawled social graph were anonymized.

### 2.3 Data Limitations
The dataset has limitations:
1. Bias towards users in the social network aggregator, primarily from Brazil.
2. User behavior influenced by specific mechanisms of each OSN.
3. Limited to a 12-day period, preventing long-term behavior analysis.

## 3. Connection Pattern Analysis
In this section, we characterize OSN workloads at the session level, examining the duration and frequency of connections to OSN services. We also model inter-arrival times and session length distribution.

### 3.1 Defining a Session
A session represents the sequence of a user's requests during a single visit to the social network aggregator. Sessions are identified based on the start and end times of user activity.
