ABSTRACT
Understanding how users behave when they connect to social
networking sites creates opportunities for better interface
design, richer studies of social interactions, and improved
design of content distribution systems.
In this paper, we
present a ﬁrst of a kind analysis of user workloads in on-
line social networks. Our study is based on detailed click-
stream data, collected over a 12-day period, summarizing
HTTP sessions of 37,024 users who accessed four popular
social networks: Orkut, MySpace, Hi5, and LinkedIn. The
data were collected from a social network aggregator web-
site in Brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple
social networks with a single authentication. Our analysis
of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social net-
work workloads, such as how frequently people connect to
social networks and for how long, as well as the types and
sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. Ad-
ditionally, we crawled the social network topology of Orkut,
so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the
social graph. Our data analysis suggests insights into how
users interact with friends in Orkut, such as how frequently
users visit their friends’ or non-immediate friends’ pages.
In summary, our analysis demonstrates the power of using
clickstream data in identifying patterns in social network
workloads and social interactions. Our analysis shows that
browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly
available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. Con-
sequently, compared to using only crawled data, considering
silent interactions like browsing friends’ pages increases the
measured level of interaction among users.

INTRODUCTION
Online social networks (OSNs) have become extremely
popular. According to Nielsen Online’s latest research [23],
social media have pulled ahead of email as the most popu-
lar online activity. More than two-thirds of the global on-
line population visit and participate in social networks and
blogs. In fact, social networking and blogging account for
nearly 10% of all time spent on the Internet. These statis-
tics suggest that OSNs have become a fundamental part of
the global online experience.
Through OSNs, users connect with each other, share and
ﬁnd content, and disseminate information. Numerous sites
provide social links, for example, networks of professionals
and contacts (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace) and net-
works for sharing content (e.g., Flickr, YouTube).
Understanding how users behave when they connect to
these sites is important for a number of reasons. First,
studies of user behaviors allow the performance of exist-
ing systems to be evaluated and lead to better site de-
sign [3, 33] and advertisement placement policies [2]. Sec-
ond, accurate models of user behavior in OSNs are crucial
in social studies as well as in viral marketing. For instance,
viral marketers might want to exploit models of user inter-
action to spread their content or promotions quickly and
widely [18, 31]. Third, understanding how the workload of
social networks is re-shaping the Internet traﬃc is valuable
in designing the next-generation Internet infrastructure and
content distribution systems [16, 26].
Despite the potential beneﬁts, little is known about so-
cial network workloads. A few recent studies examined the
patterns using data that can be gathered from OSN sites,
for instance, writing messages to other users [8, 14, 30, 33] or
accessing third party applications [10,22]. As a result, these
studies reconstruct user actions from “visible” artifacts like
messages and comments. While these initial studies yield
insights into social network workload, they do not provide a
global picture of the range and frequency of activities that
users conduct when they connect to these sites.
A complementary approach to study OSN workloads is to
use traces such as clickstream data that capture all activities
49of users [7]. Since clickstream data include not only visible
interactions, but also “silent” user actions like browsing a
proﬁle page or viewing a photo, they can provide a more
accurate and comprehensive view of the OSN workload.
In this paper we present a ﬁrst of a kind analysis of OSN
workloads based on a clickstream dataset collected from a
social network aggregator. Social network aggregators are
one-stop shopping sites for OSNs and provide users with a
common interface for accessing multiple social networks [25].
Because social network aggregators are an excellent mea-
surement point for studying workloads across various OSNs,
we collaborated with a popular social network aggregator in
Brazil for this study. We obtained a clickstream dataset,
which described session-level summaries of over 4 million
HTTP requests during a 12-day period in 2009. The dataset
included activity data for a total of 37,024 users who ac-
cessed various OSNs through the social network aggregator.
Using the clickstream data, we conducted three sets of
analyses. First, we characterized the traﬃc and session pat-
terns of OSN workloads (Section 3). We examined how
frequently people connect to OSN sites and for how long.
Based on the data, we provide best ﬁt models of session
inter-arrival times and session length distributions. Sec-
ond, we developed a new analysis strategy, which we call
the clickstream model, to characterize user activity in OSNs
(Section 4). The clickstream model captures dominant user
activities and the transition rates between activities. We
proﬁled user activities for four OSN services: Orkut, MyS-
pace, Hi5, and LinkedIn. Third, to gain insight into how
users interact within a given social network, we additionally
crawled the Orkut website and analyzed user activity along
the social graph (Section 5). Our analysis reveals how often
users visit other people’s online proﬁles, photos, and videos.
Our study provides many interesting ﬁndings:
1) Session duration is heavy-tailed, indicating large vari-
ations in the OSN usage among users. We provide a
best-ﬁt distribution function for the Orkut sessions.
2) Using clickstream data, we present the frequencies and
sequences of user activities in Orkut (Table 2 and Fig-
ure 6). We ﬁnd that browsing, which cannot be in-
ferred from publicly available data, is the most domi-
nant behavior (92%).
3) When we consider silent interactions like browsing
friends’ pages, the number of friends a user interacts
with increases by an order magnitude, compared to
only considering visible interactions.
4) Analysis of user interaction along the social graph
shows that Orkut users not only interact with 1-hop
friends, but also have signiﬁcant exposure to friends
that are 2 or more hops away (22%).
In summary, our study provides a ﬁrst look into the usage
of OSN services from the viewpoint of a social network aggre-
gator. The clickstream data analyzed in the paper provides
an accurate view of how users behave when they connect to
OSN sites. Furthermore, our data analysis suggests several
interesting insights into how users interact with friends in
Orkut. We believe that our ﬁndings have implications for
eﬃcient system design.
2. DATASET
We use two datasets in this paper. The ﬁrst is a click-
stream dataset that is collected and provided by a social
network aggregator site. The second is the Orkut social net-
work topology that we crawled. These two datasets provide
complementary types of information that we correlate in
Section 5. Below we describe both datasets and our method-
ology for crawling Orkut. We also discuss some limitations
of these datasets.
2.1 Clickstream data
Social network aggregator
We describe how social network aggregators operate and
introduce the clickstream dataset we obtained and analyzed.
2.1.1
Social network aggregators pull content from multiple so-
cial networking sites to a single location, thereby helping
users who belong to multiple networks manage diverse pro-
ﬁles more easily [25, 27]. Upon logging into a social network
aggregator, users can access their social network accounts
through a common interface, without having to login to each
OSN site separately. This is done by a two-level real-time
HTTP connection: the ﬁrst level is between a user and a so-
cial network aggregator site and the second is between the
social network aggregator site and the OSN sites. Social
network aggregators typically communicate with OSN sites
using Open APIs that OSN sites provide [12]. All content
from OSN sites are shown to users through a social network
aggregator’s interface. Figure 1 depicts the scheme interac-
tion among users, a social network aggregator site, and OSN
sites. Through the interface of the social network aggrega-
tor, a user can enjoy all features that are provided by OSN
sites, for instance, checking updates from friends, sending
messages, and sharing photos.

ple OSNs through the social network aggregator
2.1.2 Data description
The clickstream data that we analyzed were collected over
a 12-day period (March 26 through April 6, 2009). The data
consist of summaries of HTTP header information for traf-
ﬁc exchanged between the social network aggregator server
and users. The dataset summarizes 4,894,924 HTTP re-
quests, including information about time stamp, HTTP sta-
tus, IP address of the user, login ID in the social network
aggregator site, URL of the social network site, login ID
within the social network site, session cookies, and the traf-
ﬁc bytes sent and received. After discarding events with
missing ﬁelds or HTTP status associated with error codes
(e.g., 301, 302), there were 4,649,595 valid HTTP requests.
HTTP requests in the trace are grouped into sessions, where
a session represents the sequence of a user’s requests during
a single visit to the social network aggregator. The trace in-
cluded 77,407 sessions, covering 16,175 distinct user IP ad-
50dresses and 37,137 distinct login IDs in the social network
aggregator site.
Not all log entry in the trace were related to accessing
OSNs. Some log entries reﬂect users accessing non-OSN
features of the aggregator site, such as listening to an Inter-
net radio or watching videos. Other log entries result from
the automatic display of advertisements and the aggregator
site’s website logo. After discarding non-OSN related log
entries, 802,574 or 17% of the HTTP requests were related
to accessing the following four OSNs: Orkut, Hi5, MySpace,
and LinkedIn. The remainder of this paper focuses on these
HTTP requests related to accessing OSNs.
Table 1 displays the number of users, sessions, and HTTP
requests for these OSNs. Among them, Orkut had the
largest number of users and accounted for nearly 98% of
all HTTP requests. Although the remaining OSN sites take
up only 2% of the trace, the data contain suﬃcient number
of users for each of these sites. Therefore, we can identify
meaningful user behaviors for these OSNs.

2.1.3 Data anonymization
The social network aggregator anonymized any sensitive
information that might reveal a user’s identity prior to our
analysis. There were three types of information that were
anonymized. First is the user login IDs in the social net-
work aggregator site. Second is the user IDs in the social
network site. Third is the IDs of web content that users
accessed. We could determine the content ID only if the
content ID appeared in the URL of the fetched webpage.
For example, when a user browses a particular photo, con-
tent information like the photo ID, the uploader ID, and the
album ID appears on the URL of the fetched webpage, and
was therefore logged and anonymized. On the other hand,
when a user browses his or her own homepage and sees up-
date feeds from friends, information about these web objects
does not appear in the URL of the fetched webpage, and was
therefore not logged.
2.2 Social network topology of Orkut
To gain insight into user behaviors over the social graph,
we crawled the largest OSN site in the trace, Orkut. Be-
cause of the sheer size of the Orkut network, we decided to
crawl friendship information for only those users that ap-
pear in the clickstream dataset. We used the Orkut user
IDs that appear in the trace, prior to anonymization. We
implemented a crawler which downloaded the proﬁle page of
each of these Orkut users. A proﬁle page contained a vari-
ety of information about users. Certain proﬁle information
is made publicly available to all Orkut users, for instance,
the list of friends, the list of community memberships, name,
gender, and country. On the other hand, other information
like email, phone number, and age is set private and is shown
only to friends by default. When crawling Orkut, we stored
all proﬁle information that is made publicly available.
We gathered the proﬁle information of the 36,309 Orkut
users the week after the clickstream data were gathered,
during April 10–17, 2009. The average number of friends
was 211.4 and the median number of friends was 152. Some
users had no listed friends at all, while the user with the
highest number had 998 friends. Orkut allows a user to
have at most 1,000 friends. Later we examine what fraction
of friends a user visibly or silently interacts with. The IDs
of users in the crawled social graph were anonymized in the
same way as the clickstream data.
2.3 Data limitations
Although the clickstream data give us a unique oppor-
tunity to study user activities across multiple OSNs, the
dataset has limitations.
First, the dataset is biased towards the set of users in the
social network aggregator portal. One evident bias is the
demographics of users in Orkut. To examine the geographi-
cal distribution of users, we used the GeoIP database [20] to
identify the location of 16,175 IP addresses that appeared
in the trace. These users were located across all continents
in the world, spanning 90 countries. However, certain geo-
graphical locations contained more users than others. Brazil
had the highest presence both based on the number of IP ad-
dresses (71%) and the number of the HTTP requests (70%).
The second largest user base came from India and accounted
for 12% of the IP addresses and 14% of the requests. The
third most common location was the United States. The
bias in user samples may raise a concern about how rep-
resentative our results are for other social networks in the
data, i.e., Hi5, MySpace, and LinkedIn.
Second, user behavior in a given social networking site
is inﬂuenced by the speciﬁc mechanisms the site provides.
Therefore, our ﬁndings about user activity may change as
new features are added to social networking sites. To ex-
amine the set of user behaviors that are relatively oblivious
to the speciﬁc design of websites, we studied user behaviors
across multiple social networks and tried to look for patterns
that remain consistent across multiple services.
Third, we are not able to infer behaviors of users over a
long term period (e.g., several months) since the data were
collected only over a 12-day period.
3. CONNECTION PATTERN ANALYSIS
In this section, we characterize OSN workloads at the ses-
sion level. We ﬁrst describe how sessions are identiﬁed in the
social network aggregator, then examine the duration and
frequency of connections to OSN services. We also model
two key session characteristics from a system’s perspective:
inter-arrival times and session length distribution.
