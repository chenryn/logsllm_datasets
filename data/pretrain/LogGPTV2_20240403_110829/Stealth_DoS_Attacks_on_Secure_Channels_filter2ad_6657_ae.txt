Existing works [43, 17, 24], investigate constructions of
optimal anti-replay mechanism, to reduce the resources re-
quired to maintain anti-replay window. A naive implemen-
tation would be to set N = W , i.e., the representation of the
data structure of anti-replay window is the same as the num-
ber of packets that the window represents. While this lower
bound on anti-replay window will prevent (both benign and
malicious) reordering which advance the anti-replay win-
dow and result in discarded segments, it can be too large
and inefﬁcient for practical purposes, i.e., maintaining such
a large window can be a challenge, w.r.t. processing require-
ments and storage resources (especially if a distinct SA pair
is established per each TCP ﬂow). Thus the goal is to main-
tain a window of size N  0 the number of transmitted segments in

RT T an ACK for the segment (retransmitted at time t+

should arrive (since we assume no loss and constant delays),

earlier transmitted segments, i.e., the segments transmitted
in interval [t0,k+1, (t0 + RT T )−]. The congestion window
size by the end of transmission round (t0 + RT T ) (at time
(t0 + 2RT T )−), is

Namely, congestion window, cwnd, increases by at most
