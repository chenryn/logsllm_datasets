Question: An advanced persistent threat (APT) group is known to operate using a sophisticated malware that utilizes multiple fallback mechanisms for command and control (C2) communications. These mechanisms include secondary C2 servers, use of various network protocols, and switching C2 channels upon certain triggers. As a cybersecurity analyst, you are evaluating the group's tactics and considering potential mitigation strategies. Which of the following would be the MOST effective mitigation strategy to counter the group's use of fallback channels?
"A": "Implementing strict egress filtering for all outbound traffic to limit communication to known command and control servers.",
"B": "Deploying network intrusion prevention systems that use network signatures to identify and mitigate traffic for specific adversary malware.",
"C": "Focusing solely on hardening the primary communication channel to prevent any fallback mechanisms from activating.",
"D": "Using antivirus software updates as the only line of defense against the malware used by the APT group."
Answer: B
