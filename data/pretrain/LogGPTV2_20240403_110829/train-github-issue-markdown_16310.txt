Subject: Missing angular2\bundles\typings\angular2 Folder After Upgrade

Hello,

I recently upgraded from version 2.0.0-alpha.45 to 2.0.0-alpha.47, and I noticed that the `angular2\bundles\typings\angular2` folder is no longer available. I require the bundled type definitions to compile my project successfully.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue or where I can find the necessary type definitions?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Vasil
