as well as Wrapped and Polar Laplace as baselines, respectively.
Using differential privacy in the local model is often challenging,
since it injects too much noise and hence would make virtually all
check-ins probabilistically indistinguishable in our scenario. This
is especially problematic for locations, since some areas may be
very densely populated with many bars and restaurants‚Äîso ideally,
we would like to reduce the protection guarantees to reasonably
smaller distances. This is an advantage of metric privacy and its
variants such as directional privacy, as it allows relaxing the privacy
guarantees to a defined protection radius.
Concretely, we sanitize all check-ins at the top 1000 locations
by perturbing check-in times on a periodic 24h scale with a Œît ‚â°
3 hour protection radius, using the 2-dimensional Purkayastha
and Wrapped Laplace mechanisms with temporal privacy levels
‚Ñìt ‚àà(cid:2)10‚àí3, 102(cid:3), and corresponding check-in locations with a Œîs ‚â°
(cid:2)10‚àí2, 102(cid:3). We perform 25 repetitions in each setting to obtain
10 meter protection radius, using the 3-dimensional Purkayastha
and Polar Laplace mechanisms with spatial privacy levels ‚Ñìs ‚àà
stabilized results. For each check-in, we use nearest neighbor search
to assign the perturbed check-in coordinates to the nearest location,
and aggregate all thusly obtained check-in times at each location
into a 24-hour busyness histogram. Similarly, we obtain one daily
histogram for each location based on the original, unperturbed
data, which we use as reference to compute error metrics for each
anonymization run. As in previous experiments, we use the Earth
Mover‚Äôs Distance (EMD) as metric to compare the mechanisms.
Results. Figure 8 shows the EMD over varying temporal and
spatial privacy levels ‚Ñìt and ‚Ñìs. We clearly see an advantage for the
Purkayastha mechanism over the baseline combination of Wrapped
and Polar Laplace, which is largest for privacy levels 10‚àí1 ‚â≤ ‚Ñìt ‚â≤ 1.
We also observe that ‚Ñìs has a less pronounced discriminating effect,
as an increase in ‚Ñìs generally reduces the error for both mechanisms,
but slightly faster for Purkayastha than Laplace (see also Fig. 12
for a complementary view which shows the spatial and temporal
privacy levels ‚Ñìt and ‚Ñìs in the abscissa and columns, respectively).
Figure 9 shows exemplary busyness histograms for four selected
locations, where the check-in data have been sanitized with privacy
levels ‚Ñìs = ‚Ñìt ‚âà 0.316. As we can see, Purkayastha is able to better
preserve utility than the baseline mechanisms.
5 RELATED WORK
Various DP mechanisms have been proposed for particular types
of data: In the context of location data, Andr√©s et al. [2] introduce
the notion of geo-indistinguishability together with the suitable PL
mechanism. However, their approach assumes a flat surface instead
of a curved one, which restricts its usage to smaller areas where a
planar approximation is acceptable. While it is possible to wrap the
PL mechanism around the sphere, our experiments in Section 4.3
show that directional mechanisms provide superior utility at the
same privacy level when considering global locations.
Data collection in the local model can be dated back to Warner
[43], who proposed a method to conduct surveys that allows the
respondents to maintain privacy by randomizing their response.
The goal is to eliminate evasive answer bias in cases where the
individuals may prefer not to reply at all or to reply with incorrect
answers to certain sensitive questions. Erlingsson et al. [12] present
a modern variant called RAPPOR that privately collects statistics
by hashing each user‚Äôs sensitive value to a Bloom filter [3] and
then applying randomized response to each bit in the filter array.
Their method applies to discrete values, since hashing only slightly
differing floating point values would drastically change their hashes.
Kim et al. [23] employ RAPPOR to collect indoor positioning data
based on a finite set of preinstalled indoor beacons.
Hay et al. [16, 17] evaluate existing DP histogram mechanisms in
the central model. Compared to our approach with local sanitization,
central DP mechanisms typically offer higher utility, but come at
the expense of requiring a trusted data aggregator.

Wang et al. [42] propose a matrix-valued variant of the VMF
distribution to achieve DP in the context of spectral graph analysis,
i.e., computing eigenvalues and -vectors from graph adjacency
matrices. While our proof for the VMF mechanism directly works
with its probability density, they consider the matrix Bingham-
VMF distribution with the Exponential Mechanism [31] as auxiliary,
which penalizes the privacy guarantee by a factor of 2.
Kurz and Hanebeck [27] proposed an approximate inversion
method for the VMF distribution as alternative to rejection sampling
[38, 44], which also inspired our Purkayastha sampling scheme. The
method relies on the angular CDF VMFArc[ùúÉ ‚â§ ùúó], for which they
provide an analytical solution for odd ùëõ. Unfortunately, for even
ùëõ the solution contains an infinite series with special functions
which we cannot evaluate efficiently. Moreover, as the number of
terms grows with ùëõ, we suspect that the method may only be prac-
tical for VMF when the number of dimensions ùëõ is both odd and
small. On the other hand, we argue that the method is still valuable
and practical for the Purkayastha distribution, where our solution
for PurArc[ùúÉ ‚â§ ùúó] in Eq. (14) provides a closed-form expression
with only finitely many terms, regardless of the parity of ùëõ. Our
experiments in Section 4.1 confirm that our approach provides an
effective sampling method that works in up to tens of thousands of
dimensions, pushing beyond the status quo of 150 dimensions [7].
6 CONCLUSION
We have introduced a novel notion of directional privacy for the
important class of directional data. To realize this notion, we have
suggested the VMF and Purkayastha mechanisms which are based
on spherical distributions and intrinsically suit directional data. We
have proved that they also conform to the notion of differential
privacy, and derived other statistical properties such as expected dis-
tances, related densities and cumulative distribution functions. For
the Purkayastha distribution, we have proposed a novel sampling
algorithm where previously no method was published.
We performed several analyses and experiments on real data to
show the applicability of our mechanisms and demonstrate their ad-
vantage over standard privacy mechanisms adapted to directional
data: Importantly, we observed that the new directional mecha-
nisms typically require fewer data to achieve a certain accuracy. For
directional statistics, such as the circular mean, we demonstrated
that the local model may achieve higher utility and hence is prefer-
able over the central one, since it also does not require a trusted
aggregator. The facilitated use cases include important applications
such as privately collecting mobility data in the local model, where
the data collector cannot or may not be trusted by the users.
Further work could include finding other applications or domains
for which specialized mechanisms yield improved privacy-utility
trade-offs, as well as devising more efficient sampling routines
especially in high dimensions.
