User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题HP RHEL Array Raid Disk Status from command line I've configured a HP DL360 Gen 9 with 6 disks and raid 5 and i've installed RHEL 6.9 on it. 

I need to know, from command line, the status of every single physical disk so i could grep info to an appplication we are developing.

I've been in touch with several guides that suggested to use HPACUCLI command but after i've installed the package seems it does not found any controller.

with ctrl all show status or config it says:
No controllers found

More info on this server are:

HP SMART START STORAGE 2.65.7.0
Controller is the P440R 

I've some doubts about the compatibility of the hpacucli with this HW.

Anyone has an alternative idea on how to monitor the "single" disk status to understand if it is ok, there are some errors or it is faulty?

Regards

Assistant: For RHEL, use the HP management agents to obtain overall system health. This includes the hp-snmp-agents and hpssacli 

See this for a more comprehensive list: Monitoring an HP ProLiant DL380 G7 without the bloat

This can provide SNMP and email alerts about the system, including disk health. These entries are also reported in the IML log (see hplog -v)

However, if you think it's best to parse the output of the array controller's status (I don't), you can do this with:

# hpssacli ctrl all show config
