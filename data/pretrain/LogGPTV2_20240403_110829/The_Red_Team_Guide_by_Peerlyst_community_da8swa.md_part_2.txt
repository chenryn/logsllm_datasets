You navigate to that site by clicking on the link and discover at the
bottom of the site that there are a few website links titled as "Other
Notable Web Properties." You click on the first option,
[www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com](http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/),
and you want to find out some more information about this site (it is a
truly heinous webpage by the way (1980's flashbacks)). Should you decide
to follow this lead further down the Internet rabbit hole, how can you
find out more information about this site?
![](media/image5.jpeg)One method is to use what is known as ["Google
Dorking](https://www.techworm.net/2016/04/make-advanced-search-google-using-google-dorking.html),"
also known as Google Hacking, which are advanced search strings used
within a web browser. Essentially, we are using the Google web crawler
search engine to hack with. This is an example of how hackers will take
technology and turn it upside-down to make it work in ways it wasn't
necessarily designed to. Play around with these Google Dorks to learn
what type of results you can get.
> *List of simple Google Dorks; courtesy of
> [[Techworm]{.underline}](https://www.techworm.net/2016/04/make-advanced-search-google-using-google-dorking.html)*
We can then enter [[Google Dork
commands]{.underline}](https://gist.github.com/stevenswafford/393c6ec7b5375d5e8cdc)
directly into the browser such as:
> *site:[www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com](http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/)
> ext:(doc \| pdf \| xls \| txt*
>
> *\| ps \| rtf \| odt \| sxw \| psw \| ppt \| pps \| xml)
> (intext:confidential [salary](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/salary) \|
> intext:"budget approved") inurl:confidential*
While this specific query will not return any results, we can make it
more generic by adding a Boolean search operator such as "OR" then we
can see all of these types of results:
> *site:[www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com](http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/)
> **OR** ext:(doc \| pdf \| xls \| txt \| ps \| rtf \| odt \| sxw \| psw
> \| ppt \| pps \| xml) (intext:confidential salary \| intext:"budget
> approved") inurl:confidential*
[Whois](https://www.whois.net/)
Given the above example, you could use one of several WHOIS tools to
resolve the domain name of
[www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com](http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/)
and you'll find that you get some information such as registrar info
(godaddy.com); when it was created (2008--05--14); and the ICANN query
yielded two server names (NS1.EXPMG.NET & NS2.EXPMG.NET). However,
you'll notice that the IP address is missing. Hmmm? Why is that you
wonder? This is because the WHOIS sites consider this "dangerous"
information that they protect. In other words, they want to make you
work for it. But you've got this so you keep plugging along, there's
plenty of other ways to get the website's IP address.

Command Prompt
Being a hacker, you likely prefer using the command prompt to GUI tools
anyway. Using either an xterm (Unix/Linux), a command prompt (MS-DOS
Windows), or a PowerShell console
(MS-DOS Windows), you can perform a similar query of the website using
the command:
> *tracert
> [www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com](http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/)*
![](media/image8.jpeg)In Linux, the proper command is traceroute.
PowerShell, by the way, is a much more powerful of a tool for system
administration than a simple MS-DOS command prompt. If you aren't
proficient in PowerShell you may want to work on that.
> *Using the tracert command in a PowerShell console to determine the

We now have an IP address that we can run Nmap scans against. You could
also take that IP address and run it through another OSINT tool that
specifically enumerates IP addresses such as
[Onyphe](https://www.onyphe.io/):
> ![](media/image9.jpeg)[*[Onyphe]{.underline}*](https://www.onyphe.io/search/?query=50.62.134.34)
> *IP address scan results*
As you can see, the Onyphe search resulted in a lot of useful
information that we can use later in the Enumeration phase.
[Spokeo](https://www.spokeo.com/)
People search engines such as Spokeo and others will crawl through
social media sites, whitepages, email addresses, publicly available
records such as criminal or school records, and many other types of
publicly available information sources. If you have the name of a person
within the target organization (e.g., Explorations Media Group) such as
a fictional CEO named
![](media/image10.jpeg)"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt," Spokeo's
search engine will return several leads that you can further narrow down
with search parameters (see image below).
> *Spokeo people search engine*
Sites similar to Spokeo are *Family Tree Now, Pipl, Thats Them,
IntelTechniques, ZoomInfo Directory, Zaba Search, USSearch, Snoop
Station, Radaris,* to name but a few. There are many, many more to try
out. Now you might begin to see why the collection of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and selling it to interested
third-parties is such a lucrative business, and just how difficult it
can be to keep your own private information off the web. As a Red Team
member, you should be performing these same types of queries on yourself
to ensure your private info, or at least any potentially damaging
information, is not posted for everyone to see.
Check the [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) for a more
complete listing of people-searching tools as well as other types of
OSINT tools. You can also perform basic searches of a person\'s name in
Internet search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo.
[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)
Shodan is a popular OSINT tool that is specifically designed for
Internet-connected devices (i.e., including ICS, IoT, video game
systems, and more). You can use the Shodan GUI off the website, which
presents some added functionality; you can view live camera feeds, and
visually depict geographically where vulnerabilities are located
throughout the world. You can also perform the same types of scans that
Shodan uses to enumerate IP addresses from the command line using the
Nmap scanner tool when you get into the Enumeration phase:
> *nmap -sn -Pn -n \--script=shodan-api -script-args
> 'shodan-api.apikey=XXXXXX' worldsworstwebsiteever.com*
For the above command, -sn disables the port scan; -Pn skips host
discovery and doesn't ping the host; and -n skips DNS resolution.

[Datasploit](https://github.com/DataSploit/datasploit)
Datasploit is another OSINT tool found within the
[Kali](https://www.kali.org/) or [BlackArch
Linux](https://blackarch.org/tools.html) OS distros that collects data
on a particular domain, email, username, or phone number that you are
targeting, then organizes the results coherently in HTML and JSON
reports or text files. Datasploit will attempt to find credentials, API
keys, tokens, subdomains, domain history, legacy portals, and more.

[Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/web7/buy/maltego-clients/maltego-ce.php)
Maltego Community Edition (CE) is a free OSINT tool from Paterva with
quite a bit of functionality for analysis of real-world, publicly
available relational information. Maltego can footprint Internet
infrastructure used on social networking sites and collect information
about the people who use it. Maltego will query DNS records, whois
records, search engines, social networks, various online Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) and extract metadata that is used to find
correlational relationships between names, email addresses, aliases,
groups, companies, organizations, websites, domains, DNS names,
netblocks, IP addresses, affiliations, documents, and files.

Social Media
Social networking sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, Peerlyst, Twitter,
Google+, Instagram and Snapchat can be a gold mine for information
seekers. If you think about the types of personal information that these
sites ask users to input, and the type of sometimes *very personal*
content users often post to social media, it should be one of the first
stops in the OSINT phase of Red Teaming. To collect information on
LinkedIn for example, you may want to check out
[**ScrapedIn**](https://github.com/dchrastil/ScrapedIn). For Facebook
there is [**StalkScan**](https://www.stalkscan.com/); for Twitter there
is [**GeoChirp**](http://www.geochirp.com/),
**[Tweepsmap](http://tweepsmap.com/)** for location data, and
**[Tinfoleak](https://tinfoleak.com/)** Web for analytics. Dating sites
like Match.com, eHarmony, Plenty of Fish, Tinder, OkCupid, and Ashley
Madison are also potential treasure troves that can be checked for
particular target names and for gathering more information. With people
searches, it is really only limited by how far you want to take it. You
can pay on many of these sites to drill down further and attempt to get
more information, but that is often unnecessary if your target is a
particular company or organization.
[Automater](http://www.tekdefense.com/automater/)
Automater is a URL/domain, IP address, and MD5 Hash tool aimed at making
the analysis process easier for intrusion analysts. Given a target (URL,
IP, or hash) or a file full of targets, Automater will return relevant
results from sources like **IPvoid.com, Robtex.com,**
### ![](media/image14.jpeg)Fortiguard.com, unshorten.me, Urlvoid.com, Labs.alienvault.com, ThreatExpert, VxVault, and VirusTotal.

![](media/image15.jpeg)For OSINT reconnaissance of the Deep Web, there
are a multitude of search engines that can be used such as
[**PubPeer**](https://pubpeer.com/), [**Google
Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com/),
> *Cornell University\'s arXiv.org for Deep Web OSINT*
![](media/image16.jpeg)For OSINT reconnaissance of the Dark Web, search
engines such as [**DeepDotWeb**](https://www.deepdotweb.com/),
**[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb) [Deep
Web](https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb)**, [**Reddit
DarkNetMarkets**](https://www.reddit.com/r/darknetmarkets), [**Hidden
Wiki**](http://thehiddenwiki.org/),
**[Core.onion](http://eqt5g4fuenphqinx.onion/)** (from Tor browser),
[**OnionScan**](https://github.com/s-rah/onionscan), and **[Tor
Scan](http://www.torscan.io/)** may provide some useful information.
With the Dark Web, however, there will be some sites and services that
are by invitation only, which can make finding them very difficult
because they won\'t appear on a normal Dark Web search. Network-traffic
pattern analysis from within the Dark Web is the only real way to find
these types of sites. Remember also that Tor is not the only entrance to
the Dark Web, there is also [Freenet](https://github.com/freenet/fred)
and [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/).

OSINT collection is only limited by your imagination. You can take any
number of these tools or search examples and tweak them to your needs
and get even better results. We have only covered a select few OSINT
tools designed to give you a taste of what is out there. There are so
many more tools to discover and experiment with, many of which come
included in Kali or BlackArch
Linux distros. At the end of your OSINT collection, you should have
plenty of information to enumerate in the next phase. Happy hunting!

The most important phase before attacking a target is "Reconnaissance".
The more effort the attacker puts in during this phase, the more likely
the attack will be successful. Before the weaponization phase (gaining
access), there are four phases in reconnaissance:
1.  Footprinting
2.  Scanning
3.  Enumeration
4.  Vulnerability Assessment
During the enumeration phase, the attacker creates an active connection
with the target and tries to gain live information about it. These
pieces of information will help to identify a system attack point that
will help to accomplish the vulnerability assessment phase. We should
not confuse this with the phase where we conduct information gathering
about servers and operating systems running on them.
Enumeration is defined as the process of helping the attacker collect
information about:
-   Network resources
-   Shares
-   Users and/or groups
-   Machine names
-   Routing tables
-   Applications and banners
-   Auditing and service settings
-   SNMP and DNS details
## Why Enumeration?
As mentioned in the previous section, enumeration is one of the most
important steps. It helps us to identify the vulnerabilities present in
the target system. This information will help us to set our strategy and
make the attack easier and more effective.
## Enumeration techniques
There are many different techniques used for enumeration. We are going
to explore the most commonly used ones. Before the "scanning" phase, we
already knew what ports were open so we partially know what we are going
to enumerate:
### Extracting usernames using email IDs
If an attacker can extract email IDs, he can automatically get
usernames, as most companies give their users matching emails addresses.
For example, take the company name "XYZ," and a worker name "David
Alex," and his email will most likely be:
[david.alex@XYZ.com.](mailto:PI:EMAIL)
Automatically all worker emails will be in the same format, thus we can
extract usernames in one click.
### Extract information using the default password
Now we have usernames, it's time to try a default password. Many users
are lazy and don't make the effort to create a new password every three
months, so they automatically use their username and just add their year
of birth for example, and such information can be found in social media.
We should not forget network devices like routers, servers, and switches
when trying to identify default passwords.
### Brute Force Active Directory
Active Directory is one of the important primary targets for an
attacker. Active Directory is a centralized LDAP service that provides
identification and authentication for network devices using Windows.
Having access to this service can cover a large part of the Enumeration
phase.
Brute-force attacks on a server can probably be stopped by security
devices. That's why this attack should be performed with forethought; in
most cases, the attacker would brute force Active Directory using a
dictionary.
### Extract information from LDAP (TCP/UDP 389)
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an application protocol that
allows sharing of information on the network; this protocol can be
useful as a central place to store usernames and
passwords that will help different applications connect to LDAP in order
to validate users. Such a protocol will help us to gather information
about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout
the network.
### Global Catalog Service
In a network where we found several Active Directory services, the
Global Catalog Service is a central directory automatically built on the
basis of partial copies of information from the various directories.
Global Catalog Service can provide user information and is the most
searchable catalog of all objects in every domain.
### Extract usernames using SNMP (UDP 161) and SNMP trap (UDP 162)
Simple Network Management Protocol is an internet standard to collect
and organize information about all the managed devices in the network.
An attacker can find all log data stored on the SNMP management server,
or he can scan the SNMP trap alert messages sent over the network. SNMP
gathers information like usernames, managed devices, and network
management systems.
### Extract information using DNS Zone transfer (TCP 53)
A DNS zone transfer is an operation between primary and secondary DNS
servers in order to synchronize the records for a domain. Those
transfers can give the attacker information about the internal topology
of the network.
### Extract information using SMTP (TCP 25)
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is an internet standard for email
transmission that can be found in most infrastructures, this will help
us to enumerate usernames.
### Extract information using SMB (TCP 139)
Server Message Block is a protocol that helps us to share files in the
LAN between Windows devices. The protocol also helps to enumerate IP
address, NetBIOS computer names, available services, logged-in
usernames, and MAC addresses.
### Extract information using Microsoft RPC Endpoint Mapper (TCP 135)
Microsoft Remote Procedure Call manages most of the processes related to
network protocols and communication, that will help us to enumerate a
list of all registered programs, the RPC program number, supported
version numbers, port numbers and protocols, and program names.
