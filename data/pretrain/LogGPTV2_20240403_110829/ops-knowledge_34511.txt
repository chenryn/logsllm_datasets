User: Is there a way to know which application I'm running a python script from?
I can run python from multiple sources, like Textmate, Sublime Text 2 or Terminal (I'm on Mac OSX). How can I know, exactly which tool launched the current python app.
I've tried looking into the os and inspect modules, but couldn't find the solution.
Assistant: If you're happy to stay specific to unix and then you can get the parent PID of the process with os.getppid(). If you wanted to translate it back to a program id, you could can run a subprocess to use the relevant OS-specific PID-to-useful-data tool (odds on - ps)
