User: I pretty new to python programming, as part of my learning i had decided to start coding for a simple daily task which would save sometime, I'm done with most part of the script but now i see a big challenge in executing it , because i need to execute it a remote server with the sudo user access. Basically what i need is,

login to remote system.
  run sudo su - user(no need of password as its a SSH key based login)
  run the code.
  logout with the result assigned to varible.
  I need the end result of the script stored in a variable so that i can use that back for verification.
Assistant: The other way is to use paramiko as below.  

un_con=paramiko.SSHClient()
  un_con.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
  un_con.connect(host,username=user,key_filename=keyfile) stdin, stdout,
  stderr = un_con.exec_command(sudo -H -u sudo_user bash -c 'command')
