User: I have a specific folder in which I download certain .zip files. I am writing a python script to automate the unzip, upload, and deletion of files from this folder. Is there a way to automatically trigger my python script each time a zip file is downloaded to this folder?
[EDIT] : i am on osx mavericks, sorry for not mentioning this from the start
Assistant: Yes, you can use inotify (e.g. using pyinotify) to get a callback whenever a new file is created. It is not available on Windows though. There might be a similar api available, but I don't know if there are python bindings for that API.
