**Subject: Issues with Python Installation and File Associations After Uninstalling Python 2.7.2**

Dear Support,

I recently uninstalled Python 2.7.2 from my computer, as I only use Python 3. However, after the uninstallation, I encountered a few issues:

1. **File Association Problem:**
   - All my Python files, which were previously associated with Notepad, no longer open with Python.
   - When I attempt to change the file association back to Python, the system does not register the change. There is no error message, but the association remains unchanged.

2. **Pythonw and IDLE Issue:**
   - I reinstalled Python 3.4 to resolve the file association problem, but now I am unable to open the `pythonw.exe` file.
   - As a result, I cannot launch the IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) to work on my Python scripts.

**Steps Taken:**
- Rebooted the system multiple times.
- Attempted to reinstall Python 3.4, but the issue persists.

**Current Situation:**
- I am currently unable to use Python, and I am particularly concerned about the inability to open the `pythonw.exe` file and access IDLE.

**Desired Solution:**
- A fix for both the file association problem and the `pythonw.exe`/IDLE issue would be greatly appreciated. However, resolving the `pythonw.exe`/IDLE problem is my top priority.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,

**Assistant's Suggested Fix:**

To address these issues, you can try the following steps:

1. **System Restore:**
   - Perform a system restore to a point before you uninstalled Python 2.7.2. This will revert your system to a state where Python was working correctly.
   - After the system restore, you can then proceed to install Python 3.4 again, ensuring that you select the option to add Python to the system PATH during the installation process.

2. **Manual File Association:**
   - If the system restore does not resolve the file association issue, you can manually set the file associations for `.py` files:
     - Right-click on a `.py` file.
     - Select "Open with" > "Choose another app."
     - Browse to the `python.exe` file in your Python 3.4 installation directory (e.g., `C:\Python34\python.exe`).
     - Check the box "Always use this app to open .py files."

3. **Reinstall Python 3.4:**
   - Ensure that you download the latest version of Python 3.4 from the official Python website.
   - During the installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" and "Register Extensions."
   - After the installation, verify that `pythonw.exe` is located in the correct directory (e.g., `C:\Python34\pythonw.exe`).

If these steps do not resolve the issues, please provide more details about your operating system and any error messages you may encounter during the process.
