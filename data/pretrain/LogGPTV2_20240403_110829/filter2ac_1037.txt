titleblackhat:us-22 Better Privacy Through Offense: How To Build a Privacy Red Team
Red teams are an important component of a holistic cyber security program because they test how well the program stands up to threats from real adversaries. In 2021, Meta created a privacy red team to help improve our privacy posture and preserve the privacy of our ~3 billion users and their data. Based on that experience, we present the case for why a privacy-focused red team is an important part of a holistic privacy program. In this talk, you'll learn what a privacy red team is, how it's different from a security red team, the challenges we faced, and examples of real operations we performed. You'll walk away with a better understanding of how privacy red teaming can benefit your organization, and the role that offense can play in your privacy defense.
