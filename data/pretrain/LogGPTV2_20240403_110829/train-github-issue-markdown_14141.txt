  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Navigate to the next page without errors.
## Current Behavior
Taking a 'quiz' after reading through a lesson. I've already completed the
quizes, but when I click "next" to leave the page I get an "An unexpected
error has occurred." message and an error in the console.
"Error: StyleSheetRegistry: styleId: `jsx-1586328328` not found.  
Stack trace"
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Having already completed the lessons (possibly a factor) go through the quizes
  2. After hitting next on a page with a quiz, observe the error message in the browser and console.
## Context
Trying to review content, errors on every other page is a rough ux.
