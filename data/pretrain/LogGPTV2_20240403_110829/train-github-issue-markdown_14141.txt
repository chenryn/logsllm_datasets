## Expected Behavior
The user should be able to navigate to the next page without encountering any errors.

## Current Behavior
After completing a lesson and taking the associated quiz, when I click the "Next" button to proceed to the next page, an error message appears: "An unexpected error has occurred." Additionally, the following error is logged in the console:
```
Error: StyleSheetRegistry: styleId: `jsx-1586328328` not found.
Stack trace
```

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Complete all the lessons and quizzes.

3. Click the "Next" button on a page with a quiz.
4. Observe the error message in the browser and the error in the console.
