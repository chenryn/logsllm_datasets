I have a component that uses NgFor to create other components inside it's
view, by iterating over a list.
I use ViewQuery to get a hold of the child components.
All is well until i change the `playlist` getter to return a map of the
original array:
      get playlist() {
        return this.content.map((i) => { return {name: i.name + 'y'} })
      }
It seems that NgFor repeatedly destroys and creates the components, on each
change, but the ViewQuery keeps accumulating components. After a few ticks,
ViewQuery stops working entirely and throws.
Here is a plunker showcasing the bug:
