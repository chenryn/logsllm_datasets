 For instance they merged a project of chocolate packaging of a local chocolate maker with storytelling, with 
that of the creation of new rituals by making together lanterns out of recycled material, with a pre-existing 
street music festival and with a forgotten neighborhood tradition. Now it became a pilgrimage of musicians, 
happening once a year, whose story is told in the packaging of the street chocolate, where the street lanterns 
are used See: http://journalsaintgilles.wordpress.com/about/le-pelerinage-des-musiciens/

 A similar line of thought could be followed for professional designers, with the main difference being that 
design schools can often operate more freely than professionals and as such can more easily experiment, 
are implicitly allowed to fail and as such also can spend time and effort to research and try out new forms of 
interactions amongst citizens, policy makers and civil servants.

INNOVATION WITHOUT BOUNDARIES:  
ECOLOGY OF INNOVATION AND  
MUNICIPAL SERVICE DESIGN
Luigi Ferrara,  Magdalena Sabat
ABSTRACT
The Institute without Boundaries (IwB) has worked extensively with North American and international 
municipal governments. The Institute’s emphasis on design thinking and an ecology of innovation approach 
have enabled creative interventions and design solutions for the public service sector. The article describes 
the IwB’s latest collaborations: the COLAB project conducted with the City of Markham in 2011-2012 and the 
Dublin Project conducted with the Dublin City Council in 2012-2013. These partnerships have built bridges 
between municipal governments and citizens, producing tangible solutions to innovate public service delivery 
in both cities. They have also sparked and developed inter-organizational collaboration and co-creation, 
showing that forming global design based networks is an important aspect of contemporary service design. The 
IwB’s ecology of innovation approach in the Markham and Dublin projects serves as a model for building and 
discovering new strategies to innovate public service.

INTRODUCTION1
When thinking about how design, social innovation 
and public policy intersect, the discussion typically 
focuses on only one of those variables, an indication of 
how challenging it can be to bring the three together. 
The final decades of the 20th century saw experts 
emphasizing technological innovation as a connective 
and utopic force to drive social change and economic 
opportunity. However, this approach has also been 
critiqued as a form of technological determinism that 
reduces complicated environmental, spiritual and social 
problems to issues of connectedness and access to new 
technology.
The potential of technological innovation has been 
reevaluated and redefined. Technology is increasingly 
seen as embedded in a system of processes that when 
understood and translated become socially useful. For 
instance, at the Fifth European Academy of Design 
Conference in 2003, Hendrik Reynders emphasized, 
“Technology is not limited to the so-called hardware 
that we produce, but relates to that complete process 
of translating inventive scientific thinking into new 
processes and new forms of production.”2 Thus, 
‘technology’ is not a singular object but rather a 
process that functions in a web of social, political and 
economic relationships.
An increasing number of politicians, business people, 
activists, and scholars are beginning to examine social 
innovation as an alternative tool to solve ‘wicked’3 
global challenges such as income distribution, resource 
depletion, over development, and environmental 
degradation. In these debates social innovation is 
synonymous with tools, strategies, or relationships 
that enable social change. The concept of social 
innovation is a welcome tonic to the over emphasis on 
technology, but its promotion as an end in itself could 
lead to similar short sightedness in the management 
and promotion of innovation. Innovation has its own 
ecology comprised of a number of factors that need to 
harmonize before it can take root and have effect.

There is no single ingredient that drives successful 
innovation. In “Systems Design: Working with Change” 
(2012), Nigel Snoad argues that innovation has to 
account for the emerging interconnectedness and 
interdependence of complex systems that focus on 
users’ functions - in other words, how we live today. He 
states: “we actually live in multiple communities at 
once: the places we work, the places we travel, where 
our parents live.”4 According to Snoad, to address the 
complexity of our lives, innovation has to be multi-
directional and multi-faceted. 
The Institute without Boundaries (IwB) uses an 
ecology of innovation approach. Figure 1, shows the 
interconnectedness of political, social, design, technical, 
and business innovation. Here an ecology of innovation 
is firstly an understanding that innovation is multi-
directional and multi-faceted. The figure proposes that 
it is a constellation of factors in balance and alignment 
that makes true and lasting innovation possible. While 
social innovation may help us determine how we might 
want to live differently, technological innovation can 
build platforms that allow for these new possibilities 
to operate; design innovation can contextualize those 
possibilities into formats we can understand and use; 
business innovation can render the formats replicable 
and propagate them in society; and political innovation 
can assist in institutionalizing innovation, creating a 
pervasive environment of innovation that becomes a 
background that guides and regulates how we live. As 
a conceptual method, an ecology of innovation is based 
on the proposition that all these forces interacting on 
a level plane are require to make social change. The 
method promotes a culture and attitude of change and 
experimentation and considers innovation as inclusive 
of tools, strategies, and the development of key 
relationships, recognizing that it is the synergy of these 
factors that enables social change. 
The implementation of an ecology of innovation in the 
public sector has different challenges than those in 
the private sector. City bureaucracies have established 
speeds, processes and budgets that can seem resistant 
to change. Municipal bodies have a metonymic 
relationship to the cities they represent and govern, 
and on a smaller scale they represent the whole of

the city structure. Differences in perspectives and 
approaches within the municipal government body 
make it difficult to address the whole organization 
and the whole city. When viewed as a constellation 
of factors and attitudes that accounts for the 
complexities of everyday life, innovation in public 
service is multi-dimensional and complex, but not 
impossible to manage and change.
The Institute without Boundaries has been working 
with municipal partners since its inception in 2003 
as a collaborative studio environment and academic 
program that seeks to achieve social, ecological and 
economic innovation. In its most recent projects, 
it has worked with the City of Markham in Canada 
and the Dublin City Council in Ireland. Markham 
and Dublin are very different cities, with different 
problems, still there are many similarities facing these 
municipal governments in terms of public service 
delivery, specifically how to channel new ideas into 
public service and build better relationships with 
citizens. The IwB’s ecology of innovation approach is 
an evolving method that can be used as a framework 
for service design. The work here presented not only 
showcases the innovative ideas created by the IwB 
students, staff and project partners, more importantly 
it discusses the benefits for municipal governments 
of working with an interdisciplinary body like the IwB. 
The discussion below highlights the experience of 
107
collaboration from the perspectives of the municipal 
government, IwB staff, and students to show that at 
its core innovation is an ecology that requires the 
development of organizational relationships as much 
as it needs new research, tools, and strategies.
Working with Cities: The IwB and its partners 
The Institute without Boundaries (IwB) is located 
in Toronto. It was founded in 2003 by the School of 
Design at George Brown College, in consultation with 
Bruce Mau. It is a unique academic, research and 
development program focused on collaborative design 
practice with the objectives of social, ecological and 
economic innovation through design research and 
strategy. Central to this work are real projects of public 
and global significance that are executed by students, 
faculty and industry experts as part of academic 
curriculum, research initiatives, and creative projects. 
The IwB has worked with several city entities, and 
many not for profit organizations and industry partners. 
Along with the Municipality of Markham, Ontario, and 
the Dublin City Council, some of the Institute’s past 
project partners include: the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation, the Ministry of Housing in Costa 
Rica, Habitat for Humanity Canada, Evergreen Canada, 
the Toronto Community Housing Corporation, and the 
Chilean City of Lota. These and other partnerships are 
part of the IwB’s research program, which has evolved 
since 2002 when the Institute began its first major 
project called Massive Change, a two year initiative 
that examined the role of design in addressing social, 
environmental and economic progress. Massive Change 
spurred World House, a four-year project between 2004-
2008 that explored the design of shelter, advanced 
housing solutions that promote inclusion, sustainability, 
affordability, and technological and environmental 
responsiveness. From this initiative came the City 
Systems research project from 2009-2012 that looked 
at the evolution of resilient twenty-first century models 
for large-scale social housing, towns rebuilding after 
natural and economic disasters, edge cities needing 
to become complete cities, layering and density in city 
centers, as well as the design of public service delivery.
The City Systems research focus was the framework 
for partnerships with the City of Markham and the 
Dublin City Council. It addressed the micro and macro 
levels of service provision within cities to understand 
the systems present in municipal governance and 
how an ecology of innovation can realign and make 
these systems more efficient. The work conducted 
shows that in a short time municipal governments 
can reinvigorate their internal organizational 
communication, develop better communication with 
citizens, and generally add social and economic 
value to the municipality. The success of the projects 
has been in large part due to the open attitude of 
municipal staff, a disposition that project participants 
have described as leadership that is forward thinking 
and able to understand and mediate the conditions 
for change. The IwB’s collaboration with Markham 
and Dublin has pinpointed opportunities for 
infrastructural and urban beautification, expansion 
of cultural programming, new efficiencies in public 
service communication, as well as proposals for 
innovation units within the municipality. The Markham 
and Dublin projects serve as models for new forms 
of collaboration and strategies for building strong 
partnerships to innovate public service delivery.
COLAB: A Future Change Lab for Markham
In 2011, during the third year of City Systems research, 
the City of Markham became a major sponsor and 
project partner of the Institute. The IwB spent nine 
months studying Markham, Ontario, exploring its 
municipal systems, and proposing design strategies 
and key interventions for Highway 7 and the other 
main streets of Markham. At the outskirts of Toronto, 
Markham is an ‘edge city’ in many respects, with 
homogenous residential areas, large distances, and little

has an incredibly diverse and growing population of 
more than 300,000 citizens, over fifty percent of whom

also new immigrants. The city holds a powerful position
