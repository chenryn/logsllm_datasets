##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.0.0-pre
  * Operating System / Platform => Windows 64 Bit
  * Compiler => MinGW g++ (tdm-1) 5.1.0 from codeblocks
##### Detailed description
I built OpenCV from source using MinGW which was shipped along with
codeblocks.  
My build and install was successful.

Now, to check my built library I ran a sample program
## **OpenCVTest.cpp**
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    using namespace cv;
    using namespace std;
    int main( )
    {    
      // Create black empty images
      Mat image = Mat::zeros( 400, 400, CV_8UC3 );
      // Draw a line 
      line( image, Point( 15, 20 ), Point( 70, 50), Scalar( 110, 220, 0 ),  2, 8 );
      imshow("Image",image);
      cout<<"******************";
      waitKey( 0 );
      return(0);
    } 
using cmd -
`g++ -std=c++11 OpenCVTest.cpp -llibopencv_core400 -llibopencv_highgui400
-llibopencv_imgproc400`
I am able to compile to source code, but on running the program, I am getting
a window pop up with **program has stopped working** message

##### Steps to reproduce
  1. Downloaded the source code from github.
  2. Using CMake, pointed the source code directory and the build directory.
  3. Ran CMake and it generated some file and folders in build directory.
  4. Ran **mingw32-make** command in build directory.
  5. Ran **mingw32-make install**.
  6. Copied the folder `opencv2` in `D:\Programs\OpenCV-Source\build\install\include` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include`
  7. Copied the files (.dll) from `D:\Programs\OpenCV-Source\build\install\x86\mingw\bin` to `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`
  8. Copied the files (.a files) from `D:\Programs\OpenCV-Source\build\install\x86\mingw\lib` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib`
  9. Wrote the above program on FAR Manager.
  10. compiled on cmd using `g++ -std=c++11 OpenCVTest.cpp -llibopencv_core400 -llibopencv_highgui400 -llibopencv_imgproc400`
  11. produced `a.exe`. Ran it and got the error.
