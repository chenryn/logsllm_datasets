User: How to use GIT for code version control and team collaboration development management?
Assistant: Using GIT for code version control and team collaboration development management requires the following steps: 1. Create a code base When using GIT, you first need to create a code base on a local or remote server. Before that, you need to make some configurations, such as setting the user name and mailbox wait. Common code hosting platforms include GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. 2. Initialize the project After creating the code base, you need to initialize the project on the local computer, use the command line tool to enter the project directory, and then use the git init command to initialize. 3. Add code to the code base After project initialization, you need to add code to the code base by using the git add command. It should be noted that some files and folders that do not need version control need to be ignored before adding code, such as log files, temporary files, etc. You can use the .gitignore file to specify files to ignore. 4. Submit the code After adding the code to the code base, you need to use the git commit command to submit the code and attach the submission information, which is used to describe the purpose and content of this submission. 5. Branch management Branch is one of the most important features of GIT, it can help team members develop different functional modules independently, and finally merge them into the main branch. Use the git branch command to create, switch, and delete branches, and use the git merge command to merge different branches into one. 6. Team collaboration Using GIT for team collaboration requires management of team member permissions, and it is recommended to adopt a role-based permission management model. In team collaboration, code push and pull operations are required, which are mainly implemented using git push and git pull commands. At the same time, operations such as code review and merging are also required. 7. Version rollback and revocation In the development process, some problems will inevitably occur, and version rollback or code revocation operations are required. Use the git reset command to roll back the code base to a specified version, and use the git revert command to undo a commit. The above are some basic steps and operations of using GIT for code version control and team collaboration development management. It requires continuous learning and practice to better use GIT to manage code.
