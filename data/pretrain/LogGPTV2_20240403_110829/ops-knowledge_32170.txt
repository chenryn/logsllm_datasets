User: I'm debugging my Python code in Eclipse using the Pydev plugin. I'm able to open a Pydev console and it gives me two options: "Console for currently active editor" and "Python console". However none of them is useful to inspect current variable status after a breakpoint.
For example, the code stopped at a breakpoint and I want to inspect an "action" variable using the console. However my variables are not available. How can I do things like "dir(action)", etc? (even if it is not using a console).
Assistant: When I set a break point and hit F11 Eclipse launches the debugger and prompts to open the "Debug Perspective". You can then open the Window-->Show View --> Expressions  which opens the expressions view, you can then right click in the Expressions view windows and choose "Add Watch Expression" to add any expression(such as dir)
Conversely I was also able to type in dir(some expression) in the PyDev console and get the same effect.
I'm using PyDev 1.4.6.2788
