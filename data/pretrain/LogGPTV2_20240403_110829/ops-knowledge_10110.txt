User: I have a python script, that needs to load a large file from disk to a variable. This takes a while. The script will be called many times from another application (still unknown), with different options and the stdout will be used. Is there any possibility to avoid reading the large file for each single call of the script?
I guess i could have one large script running in the background that holds the variable. But then, how can I call the script with different options and read the stdout from another application?
Assistant: Make it a (web) microservice: formalize all different CLI arguments as HTTP endpoints and send requests to it from main application.
