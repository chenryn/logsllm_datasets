User: I know that I should open a binary file using "rb" instead of "r" because Windows behaves differently for binary and non-binary files. 
But I don't understand what exactly happens if I open a file the wrong way and why this distinction is even necessary. Other operating systems seem to do fine by treating both kinds of files the same.
Assistant: For reading files there should be no difference. When writing to text-files Windows will automatically mess up your line-breaks (it will add \r's before the \n's). That's why you should use "wb".
