**Fourth**, this research utilized only one dataset of tracing data. Future work could involve testing the tools and methods with other tracing datasets, which would be an interesting direction to explore.

**Fifth**, the system from which the data was gathered was a company testing system. A more robust future approach would be to use a microservice-based simulated system, where developers can inject faults such as request flow redirection and latency issues. This would allow for more controlled and comprehensive testing of the developed tools and methods.

**Sixth**, this research focused solely on tracing data. An interesting path forward would be to incorporate additional types of data, such as monitoring and logging data from the target system. This would provide a more comprehensive analysis by offering a broader understanding of the system's behavior.

**Seventh**, after its development, the OpenTelemetry solution could address points 2 and 5 mentioned here. The community has high expectations for its success, and the project's commitment is evident in its ongoing activity. For these reasons, OpenTelemetry is a project to watch in the coming months.

We began with tracing data provided by Huawei and formulated research questions based on Development and Operations (DevOps) needs and OpenTracing characteristics. We then designed a proposed solution capable of processing tracing data and extracting metrics. After implementing this solution, we used it to retrieve results. These results highlighted some issues in the OpenTracing specification and the challenges of analyzing a distributed system using only tracing information.

OpenTelemetry was initiated near the end of the research presented in this thesis, with the primary goal of merging OpenCensus and OpenTracing into a single Application Programming Interface (API). This project also aims to review and improve both specifications. The work performed in this research aligns well with the objectives of OpenTelemetry, as it addresses many of the problems raised in this thesis.

In conclusion, despite the imposed limitations, this work can be considered a success. The research directions are at the forefront of the state-of-the-art, related work, and the general community of tracing usage and analysis. Additionally, tools for tracing processing and analysis were developed, and the created methods and conclusions were used to produce a scientific paper submitted to the International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (IEEE NCA 2019).
