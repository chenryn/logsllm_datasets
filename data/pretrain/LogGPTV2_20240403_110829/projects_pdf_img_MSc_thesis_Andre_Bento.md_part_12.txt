Fourth, just one data set of tracing data was used in this research. Test the tools and
methods with other tracing data could be an interesting path.
Fifth, thesystemwerethedatawasgatheredwasacompanytestingsystem. Onegood
future approach was to have a microservice based simulated system, were the developers
could inject faults like request flow redirection, latency issues, and others, point them out
and test the developed tools and methods.
Sixth, only tracing data was used in this research, one interesting path to follow is to
have more kinds of data like monitoring and logging from the target system. This could
help the analysis of the system, due to more knowing about it.
Seventh,afterdeveloped,OpenTelemetry solutioncouldcoverpoints2and5mentioned
here. Also, expectation of success is high in the community, and commitment is visible in
the project pulse. For these reasons, this project is a must watch in the following months.
We started with only tracing data provided by Huawei, and walked a path were we
defined research questions based in Development and Operations (DevOps) needs and

Conclusion and Future Work
in OpenTracing characteristics. Later on, we designed a proposed solution capable of
processing tracing data and extract metrics from this type of data. Then we implemented
this solution and used it to retrieve results. These results proved some issues presented in
OpenTracing specification and the difficulty that is to analyse a distributed system only
using tracing information.
OpenTelemetry was created and started near the end of the research work presented in
this thesis, with the core objective of merging OpenCensus and OpenTracing into a single
Application Programming Interface (API), and consequently, review both specifications
in order to modify and improve them. This projects emphasizes the work performed in
this research, because the raised problems in this thesis are covered by it.
In the end, given the imposed limitations, one may conclude that this work was a
success because the research directions are in the vanguard of the state of the art, re-
lated work and general community of tracing usage and analysis. Also, tools for tracing
processing and analysis were developed and the created methods and conclusions were
used to produce a scientific paper submitted to the International Symposium on Network
Computing and Applications (IEEE NCA 2019).
