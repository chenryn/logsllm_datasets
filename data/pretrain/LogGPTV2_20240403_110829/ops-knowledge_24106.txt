User: I would like to deploy a Python3 app that uses tkinter on OpenShift.  I added the following to setup.py: install_requires=["Tcl==8.6.4"].  When I ran git push I received the following error:

Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('Tcl==8.6.4').

Can anyone provide the correct syntax, distribution package name and version?
Assistant: Bryan has answered the question.  Tkinter will not work with WSGI.  A web framework such as Django must be used.
