User: Please follow the steps below to build and publish Docker images, including writing Dockerfile, building and testing images, uploading to Docker Hub, etc. 1. Write Dockerfile\nFROM python:3.6\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN pip install - r requirements.txt\nEXPOSE 5000\nCMD python app.py\n2. Build image\n$ docker build -t myapp .\n3. Test image\n$ docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp\n4. Log in to Docker Hub and Upload image\n$ docker login\n$ docker tag myapp username/myapp:v1.0\n$ docker push username/myapp:v1.0
Assistant: 5. Delete the image locally (optional) $ docker rmi myapp Note: - Steps 2~4 are performed locally, and Docker needs to be installed and configured; - Step 4 needs to create your own namespace and warehouse on Docker Hub first. ``` - In step 4, you need to replace username with your own Docker Hub username.
