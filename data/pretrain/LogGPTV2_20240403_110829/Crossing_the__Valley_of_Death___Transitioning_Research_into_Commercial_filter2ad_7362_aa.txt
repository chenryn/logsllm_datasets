**Author:** W. Douglas Maughan  
**Conference:** 2010 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy

## Abstract
Many researchers with innovative ideas struggle to bring those ideas to market. One of the most significant challenges in the cybersecurity research community is the transition of technology into commercial products. This paper discusses technology transition activities from the perspective of a program manager, providing several examples of successful transitions for consideration.

## I. Introduction
A persistent challenge in the world of research and development (R&D), particularly in cybersecurity, is moving research through the stages of development, testing, evaluation, and transition into operational environments. Experience has shown that early and adaptive transition plans are effective in successfully transferring research into practical applications. Different technologies may require different transition paths, and the choice of path can determine the success or failure of a research product becoming a commercial product.

A July 2007 Department of Defense (DoD) report to Congress highlighted the existence of a chasm between the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) communities, which focus on component and breadboard validation, and the acquisition of system prototypes in operational environments. This chasm, often referred to as the "valley of death," can only be bridged through cooperative efforts and investments by both R&D and operational communities.

This paper provides a personal perspective on the mechanisms that have worked over the past decade in transitioning government-funded R&D into the commercial marketplace. While this paper highlights successes, it is important to note that there are more failures than successes, and understanding the causes of these failures would be an excellent topic for future research.

## II. Government-Funded Research & Development
There are several transition paths for federally funded research, influenced by the nature of the technology, the intended end-users, participants in the research program, and other external factors. Successful transition of research products often requires the dedication of the program manager, leveraging opportunities for demonstration, partnering, and sometimes good fortune. However, the most effective approach is having a proactive technology champion who is given the freedom to seek potential uses for the research product.

Several factors affect the transition of research products, including:
- Lessons learned about time and scheduling
- Budgets
- Customer or end-user participation
- Demonstrations
- Testing and evaluation
- Product partnerships
- Other external factors

### Known Technology Transition Paths
1. **Department/Agency to Industry: Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs**
   - The SBIR and STTR programs directly support the transfer of innovative technologies to small businesses. Eleven federal departments participate in the SBIR program, and five in the STTR program. These programs award over $2 billion annually.
   - Academic researchers often overlook the STTR program, which offers them the opportunity to partner with a small business and receive at least 30% of the project funds. For a Phase II SBIR, this amounts to $225K. These funds often go unused, and many small businesses are eventually acquired by larger companies, leading to broader deployment of the technology.

2. **Department/Agency to Academia to Industry (Typically via a Startup Company)**
   - Many government agencies fund academic research but do not provide mechanisms to facilitate the transition to the commercial world. Successful commercialization often results from the heroic efforts of the original professor or graduate student through a startup company. Venture capitalists play a role by providing seed funding for these startups. In-Q-Tel, a government entity, provides startup funding specifically for intelligence community products.

3. **Department/Agency to Open Source Community**
   - Several government agency programs encourage or require software development to be released under open source licenses. Open source availability is well-documented as an effective means to bring software capabilities into adoption, use, and support by larger communities.

### Technology Assessment
Many researchers, including those in the private sector, academia, and government labs, develop prototypes. However, the transition from prototype to full commercial support, documentation, and maintenance remains a critical and often expensive issue. 

Government agencies and commercial companies use the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to assess the maturity of evolving technologies before incorporating them into systems. TRLs involve experimentation, refinement, and increasingly realistic operational testing. Once proven, the technology can be deployed with confidence. There is ongoing debate about the use of TRLs for software and software systems, particularly in cybersecurity, where there are no agreed-upon standards for software assurance, metrics, and evaluation.

## III. The DARPA Years

### A. The 1990s
I first became acquainted with DARPA in the mid-1990s while working as an information security researcher at the National Security Agency (NSA). My involvement in DARPA's Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) review boards led to more engagement, and I eventually joined DARPA as a Program Manager in 1998.

Two notable technology transitions from DARPA in the 1990s include:
1. **Firewall Toolkit (FWTK):** Developed by Trusted Information Systems and later open-sourced, it created a thriving firewall market.
2. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Funded by Michael St. Johns and Teresa Lunt, this research led to several prototypes. Some researchers started companies, while others open-sourced their work. Most transition activities were not funded as part of the original research.

### B. 1999-2003: The Maughan Years
After completing my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I transferred from the NSA to DARPA in February 1999. I managed the "Active Networks" program and launched two new programs: "Dynamic Coalitions (DC)" and "Fault Tolerant Networks (FTN)." I quickly realized the challenges Program Managers face in transitioning technology to operational environments and commercial products.

In 2000, I initiated the CHATS (Composable High Assurance Trusted Systems) program, focused on improving security in open-source operating systems like Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. This was against the backdrop of the Department of Defense considering policies to disallow the use of open-source products. The CHATS program made significant contributions to the technology transition story of DARPA, despite political and public affairs challenges.

### C. DARPA Successes
By the time I left DARPA in August 2003, I had managed over $200 million in research funding. Despite many successful projects, few made it to the commercial market. This is because DARPA was not designed to assist researchers across the "valley of death." Three companies from my DARPA days continue to be successful:
1. **Arbor Networks:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense, founded by Farnam Jahanian from the University of Michigan.
2. **Mazu Networks:** Also DDoS and network defense, founded by Frans Kaashoek and Hari Balakrishnan from MIT.
3. **Voltage:** Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) technology, founded by Dan Boneh and his students from Stanford University.

The SBIR program at DARPA was underutilized due to small funding amounts. One successful transition from my portfolio was the acquisition of Mountain Wave by Symantec.

Additionally, the CHATS program improved the security of open-source operating systems, leading to notable enhancements in Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD during the 2001-2004 timeframe. This also prompted security improvements in proprietary vendor operating systems.

In conclusion, using "open" strategies can significantly impact the IT market and bridge the "valley of death" for technology transition.
