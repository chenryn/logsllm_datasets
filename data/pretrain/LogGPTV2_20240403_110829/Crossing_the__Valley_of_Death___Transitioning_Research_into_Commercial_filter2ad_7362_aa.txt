Abstract—Many  researchers  with  innovative  ideas  just  never 
seem  to  be  able  to  bring  those  ideas  to  market.  One  of  the 
biggest problems within the cybersecurity research community 
is  transitioning  technology  into  commercial  product.  This 
paper discusses these technology transition activities from the 
view  of  a  program  manager  and  offers  several  examples  of 
successful transition for consideration.

I. INTRODUCTION
A  consistent  problem  encountered  in  the  world  of 
research  and  development  (R&D),  which  is  especially  true 
for the field of cyber security, is taking the research through 
a path of development, testing, evaluation, and transition into 
operational  environments.  Past  experience  shows 
that 
transition plans developed and applied early in the life cycle 
of the research program, with probable paths for the research 
product,  are  effective  in  achieving  successful  transfer  from 
research to application and use. Transition plans are subject 
to  change  and  must  be 
reviewed  often.  Different 
technologies  are  better  suited  for  different  technology 
transition  paths  and  in  some  instances  the  choice  of  the 
transition  path  will  ultimately  determine  success  or  failure 
for 
the  “research  product”  becoming  a  “commercial 
product”. 
A July 2007 Department of Defense Report to Congress 
on  Technology  Transition  noted  there  is  evidence  that  a 
chasm  exists  between  the  DoD  Science  and  Technology 
(S&T)  communities 
focused  on  demonstration  of  a 
component  and/or  breadboard  validation 
relevant 
environment  and  acquisition  of  a  system  prototype 
demonstration  in  an  operational  environment.  That  chasm, 
commonly referred to as the ‘valley of death,’ can be bridged 
only  through  cooperative  efforts  and  investments  by  both 
communities -- R&D and operations. 
This paper provides a personal perspective over the past 
decade  or  so  of  the  mechanisms  that  have  worked  when 
transitioning technology from government-funded R&D into 
the  commercial  marketplace.  While  this  paper  highlights 
successes,  there  are  certainly  many  more  failures  than 
successes  and  their  causes  would  be  an  excellent  topic  for 
another paper.

II.GOVERNMENT FUNDED RESEARCH &
DEVELOPMENT
in 
There  are  a  number  of  transition  paths  for  research 
funded  by  the  Federal  Government.  These  transition  paths 
are  affected  by  the  nature  of  the  technology,  the  intended 
end-user,  participants  in  the  research  program,  and  other 
external  circumstances.  Success 
research  product 
transition  is  often  accomplished  by  the  dedication  of  the 
program  manager 
through  opportunistic  channels  of 
demonstration,  partnering,  and  sometimes  good  fortune. 
However,  no  single  approach  is  more  effective  than  a 
proactive technology champion who is allowed the freedom 
to seek potential utilization of the research product. 
Transitioning  research  products  is  affected  by  several 
factors,  including  (a)  lessons  learned  about  the  effects  of 
time/schedule,  (b)  budgets,  (c)  customer  or  end-user 
participation, (d) demonstrations, (e) testing and evaluation, 
(f) product partnerships, and (g) other factors. 
There  are  several  known  technology  transition  paths.  I 
have included a few below with examples to illustrate how 
these paths might be effectively used.
1.
Department/Agency to Industry: 
technology 
Innovation  Research 
The  Small  Business 
(SBIR) 
program  and  the  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer 
(STTR)  program  directly  support 
transfer 
associated with innovative small businesses. Eleven federal 
departments  participate  in  the  SBIR  program  (for  agencies 
with  $100  million  or  more  in  extramural  research  and 
development) and five departments participate in STTR (for 
agencies with $1 billion or more in extramural research and 
development). Overall, these programs award over $2 billion 
per  year.  It  is  worth  noting  that  these  programs  are 
sometimes run within agencies as separate and independent 
from other programs and activities in the agency. It has also 
been  my  experience  that  many  academic  researchers  are 
unaware of the STTR program. It is an opportunity for them 
to partner with a small business and receive at least 30% of 
the  project  funds.  For  a  Phase  II  SBIR,  this  amounts  to 
$225K.  These  STTR  funds  often  go  unused.  Often  these 
small  businesses  are  acquired  by  larger  companies  and  the 
technology  sees  a  much  broader  deployment  than  would 
otherwise occur.

Department/Agency  to  Academia  to  Industry 
(typically via a startup company): 
Many government agencies fund academic research, but 
do not provide  the  mechanisms  to  facilitate  transition  from 
the  academic  world  to  the  commercial  world.  Successful 
academic  research 
that  has  been  commercialized  has 
typically been through heroic efforts of the original professor 
or  graduate  student  via  a  startup  company.  There  are,  of 
course,  venture  capitalists  that  have  played  a  role  by 
providing  seed  funding  for  the  startup  company.  The  only 
government entity that provides startup funding is In-Q-Tel, 
which does so for intelligence community products.

Department/Agency 
Community: 
to 
Open 
Source 
A number of government agency programs encourage or 
require  software  development  to  be  released  under  open 
source  licensing,  as  part  of  the  research  and  development 
activities. Open source availability is well documented as a 
powerful  and  effective  means  to  bring  software-based 
capabilities  into  adoption,  use,  and  support  by  larger 
communities.
A. Technology Assessment 
Many  researchers,  including  private  sector,  academia, 
and  government  labs,  perform  research  and  development 
through  the  prototype  phase.  There  remains  an  important 
open issue of how research prototypes are transitioned to full 
commercial  support,  documentation,  and  maintenance.  The 
lifecycle  issues  are  expensive,  but  essential  and  are  often 
forgotten in planning funding for the R&D process. 
Many  government  agencies  and  commercial  companies 
use  a  measure  known  as  a  Technology  Readiness  Level 
(TRL)  to  assess  the  maturity  of  evolving  technologies
(materials, components, devices, etc.) prior to incorporating 
that technology into a system or subsystem. Normally, new 
technologies  are  subjected  to  experimentation,  refinement, 
and  increasingly  realistic  operational  testing.  Once  the 
technology  is  sufficiently  proven,  it  can  be  deployed  or 
incorporated into other systems with confidence of its ability 
to perform as expected. For more information about TRLs, 
see [1]. 
There is considerable debate about the use of TRLs for 
software and software systems. This continues to plague the 
entire software ecosystem and is of particular concern in the 
area of cybersecurity as we have no agreed upon “standards” 
for software assurance, metrics, and software evaluation. 
III. THE DARPA YEARS
A. The 1990’s 
I first became acquainted with DARPA in the mid-1990’s 
while employed as an information security researcher at the 
National Security Agency (NSA). They invited information 
security  researchers  to  participate  on  their  Broad  Agency 
Announcement  (BAA)  review  boards.  This  led  to  more 
involvement in workshops, etc. and an eventual invitation for 
me  to  go  to  DARPA  as  a  Program  Manager  from  Hilarie 
Orman  in  1998.  David  Tennenhouse,  Director  of  the 
Information  Technology  Office  (ITO),  encouraged  me  to 
come  to  DARPA,  but  wouldn’t  allow  me  to  come  until  I 
22
finished  my  dissertation  (which  in  retrospect  was  a  very 
good incentive to get it done). 
As  I  have  examined  the  technology  transitions  from 
DARPA  that  occurred  during  the  1990’s,  two  particularly 
successful  examples  stand  out.  The  first  example  is  that  of 
the  Firewall  Toolkit  (FWTK).  This  was  developed  in  the 
early 1990’s by researchers at Trusted Information Systems 
[2]  and  then  “open  sourced”.  It  created  an  entire  firewall 
market that still thrives today. The second example is that of 
the  area  of  intrusion  detection  systems  (IDS).  Research  at 
DARPA  that  was  funded  by  Michael  St.  Johns  and  Teresa 
Lunt and led to several research prototypes. This technology 
transitioned  in  various  ways,  including  researchers  that 
braved the entrepreneur world and some who open sourced 
their work for the good of the community. Most, if not all, of 
the technology transition activities were not funded as part of 
the original research. 
B. 1999-2003: The Maughan Years 
launched 
Having recently completed a Ph.D. from the University 
of  Maryland,  Baltimore  County,  I  transferred  from  the 
National Security Agency to DARPA in February 1999 and 
began working in the Information Technology Office (ITO). 
I  took  over  a  program  known  as  “Active  Networks”  and 
quickly 
two  programs  known  as  “Dynamic 
Coalitions (DC)” and “Fault Tolerant Networks (FTN)”. In 
so doing, I quickly became immersed in the DARPA culture 
and  very  quickly  came  to  realize  the  difficulties  Program 
Managers  face  as  they  attempt  to  transition  technology  to 
operational environments and commercial products. In 2000, 
I successfully “pitched” a new program known as CHATS - 
Composable  High  Assurance  Trusted  Systems  -  that  was 
focused  on  improving  security  in  the  more  prevalent  open 
source operating systems at that time, i.e., Linux, FreeBSD, 
and  OpenBSD.  The  creation  of  the  CHATS  program  was 
particularly  interesting.  At  the  time,  the  Department  of 
Defense was considering policies that would disallow DOD 
agencies  from  using  open  source  products  within  their 
enterprise environments. As part of this process, MITRE did 
a  study  identifying  over  200  open  source  packages  in  use 
within the DOD. Shutting down open source software would 
have shut down the DOD. It was against this landscape that I 
successfully convinced the Director of DARPA of the need 
for an R&D program into more secure open source software. 
If we were going to use it, then we might as well attempt to 
make it as secure as possible.  
There were two issues of political interest with respect to 
the  CHATS  program:  1)  the  fact  that  lots  of  open  source 
developers  are  outside  the  United  States.  This  created 
numerous issues when it came to contracting and even more 
concerns  when  we  tried  to  highlight  the  successful  work 
being accomplished and 2) public affairs had real problems 
presenting the story that DARPA was funding international 
researchers to create this “new” phenomenon known as open 
source software. All of this made for a very interesting three 
year  program 
important 
contributions to the technology transition story of DARPA. 
that  eventually  made  some 
Many people did not realize that DARPA was not ideally 
suited to be an organization that enabled R&D to “cross the 
valley of death”. In fact, DARPA was responsible for many 
information  security  products  that  were  developed  to  a 
degree of maturity and left to their own to commercialize or 
transition in some other fashion. This is where I began to see 
transition failures as really promising research fell on its face

and be successful) 
C. DARPA Successes 
As I prepared to leave DARPA in August 2003, I did a 
retrospective  analysis  and  determined  that  I  had  personally 
been  responsible  for  funding  and  managing  over  $200 
million dollars of research during my time at DARPA. There 
were  many  successful  projects,  but  very  few  that  actually 
made  it  successfully  into  the  commercial  market.  As 
mentioned  previously,  my  assertion  is  that  this  is  because 
DARPA  wasn’t  set  up  to  assist  the  researcher  across  the 
‘valley  of  death’.  A  decade  later  I  can  point  to  three 
companies  from  my  days  at  DARPA  that  continue  to  be 
successful today. They are: 
technology

(DDOS)  defense 
the 
University  of  Michigan.  Farnam  Jahanian  took  a 
sabbatical at the university to start the company. 
funded  at 
x Mazu Networks – Also DDOS and network defense 
technology  funded  at  MIT.  Same  story,  Frans 
Kaashoek  and  Hari  Balikrishnan  created 
the 
x Voltage  – 
company  and  became  entrepreneurs.  The  company 
was eventually sold in 2009. 
Identity-Based  Encryption 
(IBE) 
technology  funded  at  Stanford  University.  Dan 
Boneh and his students (Matt Pauker, Rishi Kacker, 
and Guido Appenzeller) won the Stanford Business 
Plan  contest  and  commercialized  the  technology 
with the help of several venture capitalists. 
Because  of  the  small  amounts  of  funding  the  SBIR 
program  at  DARPA  often  goes  unused  by  program 
managers. It was only late in  my  tenure that I released the 
real value of SBIR. I did experience one successful transition 
from my DARPA SBIR portfolio, which was the acquisition 
of  Mountain  Wave,  a  company  in  northern  Virginia,  by 
Symantec, the anti-virus vendor. 
In  addition  to  the  companies  mentioned  above,  one 
additional  method  was  used  to  impact  the  information 
technology (IT) market. The CHATS program was focused 
on improving the security of open source operating systems. 
As  such,  if  you  look  at  the  historic  timelines  of  Linux, 
FreeBSD,  and  OpenBSD,  you  will  see  noteworthy 
improvements  during  the  2001-2004  timeframe  that  came 
from  the  CHATS  program.  This  also  caused  some  security 
improvements  within 
the  proprietary  vendor  operating 
system community at that time. It is clear that using “open
