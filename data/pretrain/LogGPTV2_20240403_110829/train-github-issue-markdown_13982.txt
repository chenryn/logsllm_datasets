I believe that the exception should be handled and wrapped internally, and then re-raised as a `RequestException`-based exception.

### Traceback
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "X:\dev\rotaryboard\daemon\testdaemon.py", line 117, in <module>
    res = foobar_cmd()
  File "X:\dev\rotaryboard\daemon\testdaemon.py", line 53, in foobar_cmd
    return requests.get(url, params=params, auth=('foobar', 'meow'), timeout=0.1).json()
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\api.py", line 55, in get
    return request('get', url, **kwargs)
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\api.py", line 44, in request
    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\sessions.py", line 382, in request
    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\sessions.py", line 485, in send
    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\adapters.py", line 388, in send
    r.content
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\models.py", line 676, in content
    self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\models.py", line 615, in generate
    decode_content=True):
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\packages\urllib3\response.py", line 236, in stream
    data = self.read(amt=amt, decode_content=decode_content)
  File "F:\Python27\lib\site-packages\requests\packages\urllib3\response.py", line 183, in read
    data = self._fp.read(amt)
  File "F:\Python27\lib\httplib.py", line 552, in read
    s = self.fp.read(amt)
  File "F:\Python27\lib\httplib.py", line 1288, in read
    return s + self._file.read(amt - len(s))
  File "F:\Python27\lib\socket.py", line 378, in read
    data = self._sock.recv(left)
socket.timeout: timed out
```

### Suggested Approach
To handle this exception, you can wrap the `requests.get` call in a try-except block and re-raise the exception as a `RequestException`-based exception. Here is an example:

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import RequestException

def foobar_cmd():
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, params=params, auth=('foobar', 'meow'), timeout=0.1)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an HTTPError for bad status codes
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        raise RequestException(f"An error occurred while making the request: {e}")
```

This approach ensures that any exceptions raised during the request are caught, and a more descriptive and consistent `RequestException` is re-raised.
