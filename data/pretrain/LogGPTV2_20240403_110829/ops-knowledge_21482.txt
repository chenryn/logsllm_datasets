### Problem: SquidGuard Not Blocking HTTPS Sites

**Setup:**
- Server: CentOS 7
- Software: Squid and SquidGuard installed
- Configuration: Squid is running in transparent mode and is communicating with a Cisco ASA via WCCPv2.
- Reference: [Basic Config](http://thejimmahknows.com/proxy-wccp-cisco-asa-squid-3-4/)

**Current Functionality:**
- **Working:**
  - Blocking of HTTP sites by domain name (e.g., `disney.com`).
  - HTTPS proxying appears to be functioning, as evidenced by the following access log entry:
    ```
    1447775591.689 408846 192.168.203.110 TCP_MISS/200 63828 CONNECT 104.16.92.254:443 - HIER_DIRECT/104.16.92.254 -
    ```

- **Not Working:**
  - Filtering of HTTPS sites. No errors are reported, but the sites are not being blocked.

### Analysis and Solution

The log indicates that the HTTPS connection is being passed to SquidGuard using the IP address rather than the domain name. This is expected behavior in a transparent deployment, as browsers connect using the IP address.

To resolve this issue, you need to use a version of Squid that can pass the Server Name Indication (SNI) information to external filters like SquidGuard. The SNI extension in the TLS handshake provides the server's hostname, which can then be used for filtering.

#### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Upgrade Squid:**
   - Ensure you are using the latest version of Squid, which supports passing SNI information to external filters.

2. **Configure Squid to Pass SNI Information:**
   - Adjust your Squid configuration to include the necessary directives to pass SNI information. Refer to the Squid documentation for specific instructions.

3. **Adjust SquidGuard Configuration:**
   - Configure SquidGuard to use the SNI information for filtering. This may involve updating the SquidGuard configuration files to handle the new data format.

#### Example Configuration for SSL Bumping (Optional):

If you need to inspect the SSL content, you can set up SSL bumping. This involves setting up an ICAP web filter (e.g., qlproxy) to block the next request from the browser based on the domain name in the `Host` request header.

- **SSL Bump Setup:**
  - Follow the guide provided in the [Diladele Documentation](http://docs.diladele.com/administrator_guide_4_3/https_filtering/index.html) for detailed steps on setting up SSL bumping and configuring the ICAP web filter.

By following these steps, you should be able to enable SquidGuard to block HTTPS sites effectively. If you continue to experience issues, double-check your configurations and ensure that all components are correctly set up and communicating.
