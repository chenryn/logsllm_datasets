User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题squidguard not blocking https sites. Trying to get squidguard to block https sites.

Setup.  ( This is the basic config  http://thejimmahknows.com/proxy-wccp-cisco-asa-squid-3-4/)

Server running centos 7.
squid + squidguard installed.

Squid running as transparent.  Talking to our ASA via wccpv2. 

What is working:
Blocking of http sites by name. IE disney.com
HTTPS proxying seems to be working.  Getting access log entries of 

1447775591.689 408846 192.168.203.110 TCP_MISS/200 63828 CONNECT 104.16.92.254:443 - HIER_DIRECT/104.16.92.254 -


What isn't working. 

Filtering of https sites.    

I get no errors, just nothing happens.  I can get to the site just fine.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with my squid or squidguard.

Assistant: The log indicates your HTTPS connection gets passed to SquidGuard as IP address and not domain name; this is expected behavior as browser always connects by IP in transparent deployments. Please use the latest Squid that is capable of passing SNI info to the external filters and find out how to adjust squid guard to use this info.

If you need to look into SSL content - setup SSL bump as for example in http://docs.diladele.com/administrator_guide_4_3/https_filtering/index.html; then let the ICAP web filter (qlproxy) block the next request from the browser (the domain name will be taken from Host request header).
