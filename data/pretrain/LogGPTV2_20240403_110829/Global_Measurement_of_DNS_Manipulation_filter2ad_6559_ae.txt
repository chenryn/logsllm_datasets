rienced the most manipulation; these domains did not
appear in the CLBL, which highlights the importance
of measuring both curated lists from domain experts as
well as broad samples of popular websites. Although no
single domain experiences manipulation in more than 19
countries, several categories experience manipulation in
more than 30 countries, indicating that while broad cat-
egories appear to be commonly targeted, the speciﬁc do-
mains may vary country to country.
To study how manipulated categories vary across
countries, we analyzed the fraction of resolvers within
each country that manipulate a particular category. The
top categories vary extensively across countries. Ta-
ble 11 shows the most frequently manipulated categories
for the top 10 countries by normalized amounts of ma-
nipulation. The top category of manipulated content
in Iran, “provocative attire,” is not a category across
any of the other top 10 countries. Manipulation of do-
mains randomly selected from Alexa but not in the CLBL
(“Alexa Top 10k”) is prevalent across numerous coun-
tries, again reinforcing the need for diverse domain
datasets. Anonymity and censorship tools are manipu-
lated extensively across 85% of resolvers in China, but
not across the rest of the top 10. Pornography and gam-
bling sites are manipulated throughout.
6 Summary
Internet censorship is widespread, dynamic, and contin-
ually evolving; understanding the nature of censorship
thus requires techniques to perform continuous, large-
scale measurement. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art
techniques for measuring manipulation—a common cen-
sorship technique—rely on human volunteers, limiting
the scale and frequency of measurements. This work in-
troduces a method for measuring DNS manipulation on

a global scale by using as vantage points open DNS re-
solvers that form part of the Internet’s infrastructure.
The major contributions of our work are: (1) Iris: a
scalable, ethical system for measuring DNS manipula-
tion; (2) an analysis technique for disambiguating natu-
ral variation in DNS responses (e.g., due to CDNs) from
more nefarious types of manipulation; and (3) a large-
scale measurement study that highlights the heterogene-
ity of DNS manipulation, across countries, resolvers, and
domains. Notably, we ﬁnd that manipulation is het-
erogeneous across DNS resolvers even within a single
country. Iris supports regular, continuous measurement,
which will ultimately facilitate tracking DNS manipula-
tion trends as they evolve over time; our next step is to
operationalize such measurements to facilitate longitudi-
nal analysis.
