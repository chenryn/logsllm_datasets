### Analysis

The table above lists the top 10 domain categories that experienced the most manipulation, ordered by the number of countries (or dependent territories) where such manipulation was observed. These domains were not included in the CLBL, which underscores the importance of measuring both curated lists from domain experts and broad samples of popular websites. No single domain category is manipulated in more than 19 countries, but several categories are manipulated in over 30 countries, indicating that while broad categories are commonly targeted, specific domains may vary by country.

To study how manipulated categories vary across countries, we analyzed the fraction of resolvers within each country that manipulate a particular category. The top categories vary extensively across countries. Table 11 shows the most frequently manipulated categories for the top 10 countries by normalized amounts of manipulation. For example, "provocative attire" is the top category in Iran but does not appear as a top category in any other country. The manipulation of domains randomly selected from Alexa but not in the CLBL ("Alexa Top 10k") is prevalent across numerous countries, reinforcing the need for diverse domain datasets. Anonymity and censorship tools are extensively manipulated in 85% of resolvers in China, but not in the rest of the top 10 countries. Pornography and gambling sites are also widely manipulated.

### Summary

Internet censorship is widespread, dynamic, and continually evolving. Understanding the nature of censorship requires techniques to perform continuous, large-scale measurements. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art techniques for measuring manipulation, a common censorship technique, rely on human volunteers, limiting the scale and frequency of measurements. This work introduces a method for measuring DNS manipulation on a global scale using open DNS resolvers that form part of the Internet's infrastructure. The major contributions of our work are:

1. **Iris**: A scalable, ethical system for measuring DNS manipulation.
2. **Analysis Technique**: A method for disambiguating natural variation in DNS responses (e.g., due to CDNs) from more nefarious types of manipulation.
3. **Large-Scale Measurement Study**: A study highlighting the heterogeneity of DNS manipulation across countries, resolvers, and domains. Notably, manipulation is heterogeneous even within a single country. Iris supports regular, continuous measurement, which will ultimately facilitate tracking DNS manipulation trends over time. Our next step is to operationalize these measurements to facilitate longitudinal analysis.
