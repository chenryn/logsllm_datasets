# HTTP Error Status Codes and Caching Behavior

The following table provides an overview of cacheable error status codes, based on references [4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 25, 32, 34], and empirical study results. The table indicates whether the status codes are cached by the analyzed web caching systems.

### Table 1: Overview of Cacheable Error Status Codes
This table summarizes the cacheability of various HTTP error status codes, as determined by both referenced literature and empirical studies. It is important to note that while some error codes (e.g., 404 Not Found) can be cached, most are not, as they typically indicate transient or client-specific issues.
