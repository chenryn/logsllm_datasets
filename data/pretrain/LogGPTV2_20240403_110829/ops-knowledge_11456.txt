User: I heard that this was possible using the new modules features for the google app engine, but this will require two different modules, which basically is like two different apps. I would like to be able to run my python and php in the same application. Im getting some results via python and I want to parse them using php to get an API that is able to communicate with my other webapplications online. it will be like a proxy between my python scripts and webapplication. 
Is there any way to achieve this?
Assistant: Segregate your applications in different modules and communicate between the two using the GAE Data Store or Memcache.
Your applications can signal each other using a GET request with the name of the Memcache key or the url safe data store key.
