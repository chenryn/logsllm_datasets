our dataset of forged IPs is necessary to avoid misclassifying
the legitimate ones arriving ahead as “poisoned”.
7.3 Analysis of True Resource Records
Now that we have successfully obtained the legitimate re-
source records of the 138.7K base censored domains and
41K innocuously blocked domains, we next analyze them to
better understand the impact of blocking these domains. As
shown in Table 3, 120K (86.8%) base censored domains have
either an IPv4, IPv6, or CNAME resource record. In other
words, the remaining 18.7K (13.2%) of the base censored
domains that currently do not have any resource records, in-
dicating their inactivity. This is also one of the reasons why
we observe a large number of domains classiﬁed as “newly
observed domain” and “not rated” categories in §4.2.
For the innocuously blocked domains, the actual impact of
GFW’s overblocking may not be as severe because only 25.6K
(62.5%) of them have at least one resource record. While the
presence of resource records can be a sign of (in)activeness
for a given domain, it does not guarantee that a domain is
actively hosting any contents or services since a resource
record can also be used for redirecting visitors to a domain-
parking site. Therefore, the total number of domains with

entities to share our ﬁndings. Nonetheless, if our measure-
ment machines ever gets blocked, we can always dynamically
change their network location.
Finally, we develop GFWatch as a measurement system to
expose the GFW’s blocking behavior based on DNS censor-
ship. However, this is not the only ﬁltering technique used by
the GFW; censorship can also happen at other layers of the net-
work stack, as previously studied [33, 41, 45, 52, 73, 92, 95].
Although prior works have shown that some websites could
be unblocked if the actual IP(s) of censored domains can be
obtained properly [30, 57], securing DNS resolutions alone
may not be enough in some cases because blocking can also
happen at the application layer (e.g., SNI-based blocking [30],
keyword-based ﬁltering [80]) or even at the IP layer [58, 60],
regardless of potential collateral damage [61].
Nonetheless, DNS is one of the most critical protocols on
the Internet since almost every online communication starts
with a DNS lookup. We believe that continuously monitoring
the GFW’s ﬁltering policy at this layer is necessary and im-
portant to timely inform the public of the erratic changes in
China’s information controls policies, both from technical and
political perspectives. Appendix D provides some examples
of domains censored due to political motivations.
8.2 Suggestions
GFW operators. Although the widespread impact of the
GFW’s DNS ﬁltering policy is clear, as shown throughout
this paper, we are not entirely certain whether this censorship
policy is intentional or accidental. While prior works have
shown intermittent failures of the GFW [21, 45], all geoblock-
ing of China-based domains and overblocking of innocuous
domains discovered by GFWatch have lasted over several
months. This relatively long enough period of time leads us to
believe that the GFW’s operators would have clearly known
about the global impact of their DNS ﬁltering policy. By ex-
posing these negative impacts on several parties outside China
to the public, we hope to send a meaningful message to the
GFW’s operators so that they can revise their DNS ﬁltering
policy to reduce its negative impacts beyond China’s borders.
Public DNS resolvers. Poisoned DNS responses have
widely polluted all popular public DNS resolvers outside
China due to the geoblocking and overblocking of many do-
mains based in China (§6). DNSSEC [43] has been introduced
to assure the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses for
more than two decades to address these problems. However,
DNSSEC is not widely adopted because of compatibility prob-
lems and technical complications [32, 36, 56]. To this end,
public DNS resolvers can use the strategy introduced in §7 to
prevent poisoned DNS responses spoofed by the GFW from
tainting their cache. By waiting for all responses to arrive and
comparing the answers with the pool of forged IPs discov-
ered by GFWatch (§5), public DNS resolvers can ﬁlter out
99% of poisoned responses by the GFW. Note that it is not al-
ways necessary to wait for all responses to arrive because the
GFW does not censor all domains. As we will make both cen-
sored domains and forged IPs publicly available and update
them on a daily basis, these datasets can be used to decide
whether to wait or not when resolving a given domain. This
way, public DNS resolvers would be able to prevent poisoned
responses from polluting their cache, assuring the quality of
their DNS service while avoiding any downgrades of normal
performance when resolving domains that are not censored.
Owners of forged IPs. Legitimate owners of forged IPs
may try to avoid hosting critical services on these IPs as their
resources may be saturated due to handling unsolicited TCP
and HTTP(s) requests, as shown in §6.1. Currently, we do
not ﬁnd evidence that the GFW is using these forged IPs as
a way to saturate computing resources of the infrastructure
behind them since there are more than 1.7K forged IPs in
the pool (§5.1) and most of them are dynamically injected
(§5.2). However, a previous report of the Great Cannon [68]
has shown that China is willing to weaponize the global Inter-
net to mount resource exhaustion attacks on speciﬁc targets.
With DNS censorship, the GFW can adjust its injection pat-
tern to concentrate on a handful of forged IPs, resulting in a
large amount of requests towards these targeted IPs and thus
saturating their computing resources [34, 54, 64].
Domain owners. Using our dataset of censored domains,
domain owners can check whether their domain is censored
or not, and censored due to intended blocking or overblocking.
Unless the GFW’s operators revise their blocking rules, future
domain owners should try to refrain from registering domains
that end with any overblocking patterns discovered in §4.1 to
avoid them being inadvertently blocked by the GFW.
End users. Despite the large number of censored domains
discovered by GFWatch, different Internet users may be in-
terested in different subsets of these censored domains, but
not all. As an immediate countermeasure to the GFW’s DNS
censorship, we will make the legitimate resource records of
censored domains obtained in §7 publicly available on a daily
basis. This way, impacted users can look up and store legit-
imate resource records for particular censored domains in
their system’s hosts ﬁle to bypass the GFW’s DNS censor-
ship. Alternatively, a censorship-circumvention component of
software can implement the hold-on strategy (§7) and gather
records based on the client’s location. In case the client can-
not access the sanitized data published by GFWatch, another
client-side strategy is to send two back-to-back queries. De-
pending on whether a censored domain belongs to the dy-
namic or static injection groups (§5.2), the client can discern
which responses are legitimate. Since the majority of cen-
sored domains are poisoned with dynamic IPs, the client can
classify the legitimate responses, which typically point to the
same IP (due to back-to-back queries) or the same AS. This
way, the software only needs to know whether its intended

domains are poisoned with static or dynamic IPs. To this end,
continuous access to GFWatch’s data is not necessary for this
strategy to work, while fresh records can still be obtained.
9 Related Work
In addition to [21], which is the most recent work related to
ours that we have provided in-depth discussions throughout
our paper, some other one-time studies have also looked into
the DNS censorship behavior of the GFW in the past [22,
27, 67, 87, 88, 95]. While China’s GFW may not be the
primary and sole focus, there are platforms actively measuring
censorship around the globe that may also have a partial view
into the GFW’s DNS censorship behavior [47, 71, 78]. To
provide our readers with a complete view of these efforts and
highlight how our study is different from them, we summarize
the major differences among these studies in this section. A
more detailed comparison table can be found in Appendix E.
In its early days, the GFW only used a handful of forged
IPs [67, 95]. However, later studies have noticed an increase
in the number of forged IPs, from nine in 2010 [27], 28 in
2011 [87], 174 in 2014 [22], to more than 1.5K recently [21].
Except for [87] and [22] whose authors preferred to remain
anonymous and the dataset URLs provided in their papers
are no longer accessible, we were able to obtain data from
other studies for comparison (Table 5). A common drawback
of these studies is that their experiments are conducted only
over limited time periods and the test domains are also static,
i.e., obtained from a snapshot of Alexa top list or zone ﬁles.
To address this drawback of previous one-off studies, lon-
gitudinal platforms have been created to measure censorship
around the world, including ICLab [71], OONI [47], and Cen-
sored Planet [78]. To reduce risks to volunteers and observe in-
terferences at multiple layers of the network stack, ICLab [71]
chooses commercial VPNs as vantage points for their mea-
surement. However, this design choice limits their visibility
into China as commercial VPNs are restricted in the coun-
try [25, 29]. With different approaches, OONI [47] recruits
volunteers to participate in censorship measurements, whereas
Censored Planet [78] employs a series of remote measure-
ment techniques to infer censorship. These design choices
allow the two later platforms to obtain vantage points located
in China for their measurements. We fetch data collected dur-
ing the same period of our study available on these projects’
websites for comparison.
For OONI data, we ﬁrst gather measurements conducted
by volunteers in China that are ﬂagged as “DNS inconsis-
tency” [9]. To reduce false positives due to domains hosted on
CDNs, we ﬁlter out those cases where controlled and probed
responses have different IPs but belong to the same AS. After
sanitization, we ﬁnd 710 forged IPs from OONI data, 593
of which are in common with those observed by GFWatch.
Examining the different cases, we ﬁnd that there are still
misclassiﬁed cases due to domains hosted on popular CDNs
whose network spans across different AS numbers.
For Censored Planet [78], we use data collected by the
Satellite [84] module for comparison since it is designed to
measure DNS-based network interference. Satellite infers
DNS censorship by comparing responses received from open
DNS resolvers with ones obtained from a control resolver,
along with other metadata such as AS number, HTTP static
content, and TLS certiﬁcates. Since Satellite’s data is not an-
notated with geographical information, we use different geolo-
cation datasets [6, 7, 37, 63] to conﬁrm the location of open
resolvers used by Satellite. We then extract responses from
open resolvers located in China that are ﬂagged as “anomaly”.
We ﬁnd a total of 2.4K forged IPs reported by Satellite, 1.6K
of which are in common with ours. The difference in the
number of forged IPs in this case, is due to the inherent nature
of Satellite’s measurement approach of using open DNS re-
solvers. In particular, about 600 IPs observed by Satellite, but
not GFWatch, belong to Cisco OpenDNS, which provides
DNS-based network ﬁltering services for various customer
types, ranging from home to business users [2]. From a detec-
tion point of view, these censorship cases are valid, but due
to different local policies of these open resolvers, instead of
country-level censorship enforced by the GFW.
A shared property of OONI and Satellite is that measure-
ment vantage points (volunteers’ devices and open resolvers)
are not owned by these platforms. Therefore, only a limited
number of domains can be tested with adequate frequency to
avoid saturating these vantage points’ computing resources.
To overcome this pitfall, GFWatch’s measurement approach
of using our own machines located at both sides of the GFW
allows us to test hundreds of millions of domains multiple
times per day. Using machines under our control also reduces
the false positive rate to zero since neither of our machines
have any DNS resolution capabilities.
10 Conclusion
In this work, we develop GFWatch, a large-scale longitudinal
measurement platform, to provide a constantly updated view
of the GFW’s DNS-based blocking behavior and its impact on
the global Internet. Over a nine-month period, GFWatch has
tested 534M domains and discovered 311K censored domains.
We ﬁnd that the GFW’s DNS censorship has a widespread
negative impact on the global Internet, especially the domain
name ecosystem. GFWatch has detected more than 77K cen-
sored domains whose poisoned resource records have polluted
many popular public DNS resolvers, including Google and
Cloudﬂare. Based on insights gained from the data collected
by GFWatch, we then propose strategies to effectively detect
poisoned responses and evade the GFW’s DNS censorship.
As GFWatch continues to operate, our data will not only
cast new light on technical observations, but also timely in-
form the public about changes in the GFW’s blocking policy
and assist other detection and circumvention efforts.
