the attractiveness at time t with the repulsiveness at time t + l,
and each lag corresponds to 3 months. So, for a large number of
providers, strong attractiveness precedes strong repulsiveness by a
period of 3-9 months. There are several possible reasons for this
effect. We conjecture that some providers attract many new cus-
tomers due to advertising and promotions. These providers are not
always able to keep their new customers, leading to signiﬁcant re-
pulsiveness a few months later. This may be due to customers that
change providers frequently (such as CAHPs), or due to follow-up
advertising/promotions from competitors.
7. CONJECTURES ON THE EVOLUTION
OF PEERING
Given that a large fraction of peering links may not be visible
through RouteViews and RIPE routing tables, we do not study in
detail the evolution of peering relations in this paper. In this section,
we only present some tentative results, which should be viewed as
unproven “conjectures” about the evolution of peering. The follow-
ing observations need to be re-examined in a future study, when the
research community obtains sufﬁcient visibility of the peering links
in the Internet.
Figure 20 shows the median peering degree for each of the four
AS types. We prefer to use the median degree in this case because
the average peering degree is heavily inﬂuenced by a single LTP
provider (AS13237) that appears to have over 200 peers. ECs and
STPs have median peering degrees of zero. It is interesting that
the median peering degree of CAHPs has increased signiﬁcantly
since 2003, from 2 to 10. It is not surprising that LTPs establish
many peering links; those links are needed for global reachability
when it is not possible to directly reach some destinations through
customers. CAHPs, on the other hand, have the incentive to create

many peering links to reduce their transit costs paid to upstream
providers. Their revenues result from the content they offer or from
access/hosting fees.
Figure 21 shows the number of peering links in each category
over time. We see several interesting trends. First, the number of
peering links that involve CAHPs (CAHP-CAHP, EC-CAHP, STP-
CAHP) increased signiﬁcantly between 2001-2005, and it shows a
persistent growth rate thereafter. The exception is for the links of
type LTP-CAHP, which are almost constant in number since 2003.
The largest number, as well as the highest growth rate, is for links
of the type CAHP-CAHP and CAHP-STP. This could be because
content/hosting/access providers have the incentive to get as close
as possible to the destinations/sources of their trafﬁc. These desti-
nations/sources of trafﬁc are other CAHPs or they are networks that
are reachable through STPs. Another interesting observation is that
the number of STP-LTP peering links has remained almost constant
over the last 5-6 years. We conjecture that this is due to the “restric-
tive” peering policy of most large transit networks. The previous
observations conﬁrm the anecdotal evidence, mentioned in various
white papers (see [25] and related references), that content/access
providers are rising in the peering ecosystem as the dominant play-
ers. The underlying reason is that such ASes mostly have an open
peering policy, while transit providers have selective or restrictive
policies, peering by necessity rather than by choice.
8. RELATED WORK
A major research effort during the last decade aimed to charac-
terize the AS-level topology. One of the most well cited papers,
by Faloutsos et al. [15], argued that the Internet AS-level topol-
ogy is “scale-free”. This observation was questioned by Chen et
al. [9], who showed that the degree distribution in the Internet,
though heavy-tailed, does not obey a strict power-law distribution.
Tangmunarunkit et al. [34] attempted to explain the heavy-tailed
degree distribution, and conjectured that this could simply be due
to the heavy-tailed AS size distribution. Most previous measure-
ment studies focused on static topological properties of the Inter-
net, such as degree distribution or clustering, and did not examine
the evolution of the topology over time.
A recent study measured the average degree and effective diam-
eter of the Internet AS graph and concluded that the AS graph is
densifying [22]. Two other measurement studies [23, 32] studied
the evolution of the Internet topology in the period 1997-2001 with
respect to several microscopic and macroscopic properties. Siganos
et al. [32] observed the exponential growth of the Internet during
that time period, and showed that a rich-get-richer form of pref-
erential attachment leads to exponential growth in the number of
edges. Magoni et al. [23] examined the evolution of some global
Internet characteristics and found exponential growth in the num-
ber of ASes and links during that time period.
The observation that the degree distribution follows a power-law
led to several topology generation models that could produce such
distributions. These models focused on “growing” a topology that
could match the Internet topology with respect to certain measur-
able graph metrics. The most well known work in this area is the
preferential attachment model of Barabasi et al. [2]. An extension
of that model [1] incorporated the random rewiring of a ﬁxed num-
ber of existing links. Several variants of preferential attachment
models were later proposed [3, 36, 39]. Park et al. [28] compared
different growth models for Internet topology with respect to sev-
eral metrics such as the average diameter and clustering coefﬁcient.
The models in this research thread have been mostly descriptive.
More recent work has attempted to incorporate the effect of eco-
nomic factors in the evolution of the Internet topology, most no-
tably [31, 35].
The previous descriptive models received considerable criticism
(for instance, see [20, 21]) because they mostly focus on the de-
gree distribution and clustering, ignoring important features of the
Internet topology such as hierarchy or the presence of links of dif-
ferent types (transit versus peering). Further, the previous mod-
els do not explain how the Internet topology is evolving. This led
to new models that view the Internet topology as the outcome of
optimization-driven activity of individual ASes. These concepts
were ﬁrst introduced by Carlson and Doyle [4], and later applied in
the context of the Internet in [14] and elsewhere. Chang et al. [6]
used domain-speciﬁc information about the Internet to model AS
interconnection practices. A recent work by Chang et al. [7] models
the behavior of an AS in two distinct economic roles (customer and
peer), and examines the topological effects of actions of individual
ASes when acting in different roles. A recent editorial [17] stresses
the need to further understand the dynamics of the AS topology.
Norton [25] discusses, mainly using anecdotal evidence, how eco-
nomic and competitive interests inﬂuence peering and transit con-
nectivity in the Internet. Economides [13] discusses the economics
of the Internet backbone (without looking at topology dynamics).
Several measurement studies have highlighted the incomplete-
ness of the topologies inferred from publicly available routing data [8,
10, 18, 24, 37]. Given that the inferred topologies are incomplete,
much attention has been devoted to methods that capture as much of
the Internet topology as possible, most notably the work by Zhang
et al. [37] and He et al. [18]. Zhang et al. [38] investigated the effect
of the selection of route monitors on different applications such as
topology inference and AS path prediction. Their main observation
was that for applications such as topology and relationship infer-
ence, the publicly available BGP data are reasonably accurate, and
data from an increasing set of monitors is only marginally useful.
Oliviera et al. [27] tackle the problems of topology liveness and
completeness, i.e., how to distinguish between topology changes
that are genuine link births and deaths, versus those that are caused
due to link appearance and disappearance during routing transients.
9. CONCLUSIONS
We measured the evolution of the AS-level topology over the last
10 years in terms of growth as well as rewiring, four distinct eco-
nomic/business classes of ASes, and customer-provider links. Our
ﬁndings highlight some important trends, trend shifts, and sketch
what the Internet may be heading towards. The main ﬁndings are
summarized next.
The Internet has gone through two growth phases in terms of
ASes and transit links: an initial exponential phase up to mid/late-
2001, followed by a linear phase. Even as the network grows, the
average path length remains practically constant, meaning that the
network densiﬁes. We ﬁnd that currently, around 75% of link births
are associated with existing ASes rather than new ASes (rewiring
versus growth); similarly, about 80% of the link deaths are due to
rewiring.
We proposed a simple AS classiﬁcation scheme according to
economic considerations and business types. In terms of the pop-
ulation of these AS types, we ﬁnd that the ASes at the network
edge (ECs) contribute most of the overall growth. The average
multihoming degree has remained roughly constant for ECs, has
increased signiﬁcantly for STPs, LTPs and CAHPs. The afore-
mentioned densiﬁcation process is thus driven by transit providers
and access/hosting/content providers. In terms of rewiring activity,
CAHPs are the most active, while ECs are the least active.
We introduced two provider metrics, attractiveness and repul-
siveness, to measure the ability of a provider to attract and retain
customers. We see positive correlations between the attractiveness
and repulsiveness of a provider and its customer degree. Also, for
many providers, strong attractiveness precedes strong repulsive-
ness by a period of 3-9 months. There are a few providers that
have very large attractiveness and repulsiveness (attractors and re-
pellers). The total number of attractors and repellers between suc-
cessive snapshots shows an increasing trend.
In terms of regional growth, we ﬁnd that the Internet market, in
terms of the number of access/hosting/content and transit providers
will soon be larger in Europe than in North America. This is also
reﬂected by the fact that since 2004-2005, a larger fraction of ac-
tive customers are based in Europe than in North America, and
providers from Europe increasingly feature in the set of attractors
and repellers. This is important, because much of the regulatory
and policy debate about the Internet has been focused on North
America. Our measurements hint at an increasing European inﬂu-
ence on the Internet ecosystem.
We have explained the previous measurement results with con-
jectures about the causes of the observed densiﬁcation, the high
activity of CAHPs, and the incentives that lead certain AS types to
connect to other AS types. Unfortunately it is hard to validate these
conjectures, mainly due to the lack of pricing and other economic
data about various AS types. Obtaining such data and further ex-
plaining the previous observations in an economic or optimization
basis is a valuable direction for future work. An even more ambi-
tious goal is to model the provider and peer selection process for
each AS type. We would then be able to simulate the AS ecosystem
and better understand both the dynamics of the AS-level topology
as well as the impact of various, existing or proposed, provider se-
lection and peering strategies.
