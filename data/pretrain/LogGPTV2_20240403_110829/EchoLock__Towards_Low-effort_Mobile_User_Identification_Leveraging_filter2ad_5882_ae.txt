Impact of Device Models. We consider the performance discrep-
ancies when operating EchoLock on different mobile devices. Our
participants are provided devices with our prototype installed and
given a short explanation on its functionality. We note that a single
demonstration less than 10 seconds long is sufficient for our partic-
ipants to grasp how to operate EchoLock, indicating its ease of use.
We graph ùëá ùëÉ and ùêπ ùëÉ in Figure 10 as a ROC curve for each of our
mobile devices and observe that performance can be correlated to
the size of the device used, as users more easily acclimate to a con-
sistent posture for smaller devices compared to larger devices. We
find an average TP of 94% for a fixed FP of 5%. In particular, we find
our top performing device, the Nexus 5, capable of TP consistently
exceeding 97%. For particularly large devices such as our tablets, the
size difference between the hand and physical medium diminishes
the impact of the holding posture. This suggests our measurements
are most reliable when conducted on a small, well-defined space.
We refer to these results as a benchmark for other experiments.
N-Chirp Sequence Length. We investigate the effect of chirp
sequence length on identification accuracy as a consideration to
improve performance. While increasing the size of ùëõ used for sens-
ing enhances accuracy, we observe an onset of diminishing returns
rapidly after roughly 5 iterations. Stability around 90% can be main-
tained for ùëõ values as low as 3 in optimal test cases (i.e. smaller
devices, quiet settings), shown in Figure 14.
Impact of Environmental Noises. We study performance in
public environmnets using a subset of our mobile devices. Our
smartphone devices showed greater resilience under these con-
ditions compared to our tablet device. This may be attributed to
the lack of secondary microphones on tablet devices, which lim-
its noise-cancellation capabilities compared to smartphone. Figure
13(a) indicates the introduction of significant noise produces mea-
surable degradation, showing average TP decline ranging from
2% to 6% at a fixed 5% FP. We observe that the higher end of this
degradation may be produced by loud vocalizations, such as shouts
or laughter. We attribute this to our acoustic features, specifically
our usage of MFCC. As MFCCs are most commonly used in speech
processing, the presence of loud voices nearby causes our biometric
measurements to be overwritten by the more dominant speech
characteristics. This indicates that usage of our system may be
challenging in certain situations, such as if the user is in the middle
of a conversation.
Indirect Physical Contact. We also consider the influence of
factors that may transform properties of either the device or user‚Äôs
hand when using EchoLock. To simulate these conditions, we equip
our Galaxy Note 5 device with a smartphone case to change the
physical properties of the medium. We also provide wool gloves
roughly 2mm thick for the user to wear during separate sets of
experiments. Figure 13(b) shows our results for usage during situa-
tions where the user‚Äôs hand does not directly make contact with the
mobile device. Our findings do not show statistically significant de-
terioration for these conditions tested. On the contrary, some users
showed slightly improved accuracy ranging from 1-2%, particularly
when wearing gloves. We suggest that the material of the gloves
conformed well to the curvature of the hand while simultaneously
suppressing variance in grip behavior, such as minor shifting.
Figure 14: Performance over length of ùëõ-chirp sequence.
As mentioned in Section 5.2, a single chirp iteration requires
only 25ms, or 50ms when accounting for buffering between itera-
tions, meaning our current performance can be feasibly achieved in
execution times competitive with techniques such as fingerprinting.
This also indicates that an individual‚Äôs hand biometrics are recog-
nizable such that our machine learning framework may begin to
identify them with moderate success using relatively few samples.
9 DISCUSSION
Jamming Attacks. We also consider the possibility of acoustic dis-
ruptions to our performance via jamming strategies. To do so, we
study the ability for 10 users to use our system when an attacking
device plays a continuous signal within the operational frequency
of EchoLock. We play an attacking signal continuously sweeping
from 18kHz to 22kHz during ten identification attempts per user
at a distance of 0.2m. We find that detection of these jamming sig-
nals is feasible using a threshold scheme. We note that although
detection is possible, negating the interference still poses a chal-
lenge. However, jamming attempts from distances greater than 1m
were observed to lose potency, functioning more similar to public
environment conditions described in Section 8.5. Methods to avoid
threshold detection may attempt to limit the extent they exceed
normal intensity, however this requires careful synchronization on
the scale of milliseconds. Additionally, the jamming signal must
match the length of the ùëõ-chirp sequence, which the attacker can-
not predict. We are further improving resistance to these attacks as
part of our future work.
Potential Hardware Constraints. During our selection of can-
didate devices to experiment on, we became aware of certain hard-
ware configurations unsuitable to implement EchoLock on (e.g.
speakers on front face, microphone on back). We find that our
implementation requires our hardware components to be orien-
tated such that they are as distant from each other as possible to
allow for uninterrupted sound propagation, which cannot be accu-
rately measured with a opposite-facing components. Adherence to
this may be relaxed by leveraging additional sensor measurements
to compensate for inconvenient speaker or microphone placement,
though this also adds more hardware requirements to an intention-
ally minimalist design.
10 CONCLUSION
We have proposed EchoLock, a low-effort, and lightweight identifica-
tion protocol deployable on commodity mobile devices. Our system
verifies the user based on how the they hold their devices through
a novel technique leveraging acoustic sensing of structure-borne
sound to measure biometric characteristics. This technique can

when using smartphones, tablets, and similar devices. A prototype
of EchoLock has been implemented on Android and evaluated in
160 trials of key use case scenarios, obtaining 80,000 hand geome-
try samples from multiple participants. Our technique is quick to
conduct, low effort to use, and demonstrates accuracy over 94%. For
future work, we intend to integrate EchoLock with existing authen-
tication techniques and assess the possibility of elevating current
security rates. We also intend to improve our defense against more
sophisticated attack models and develop a more robust implemen-
tation to realize secure, low-effort identification.
