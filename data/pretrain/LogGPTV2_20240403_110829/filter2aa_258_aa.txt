7. Other Issues That Come Up

## 1. Tor: Big Picture
- **Freely Available and Open Source:** Unencumbered, with a detailed specification and full documentation.
- **Compatibility and Research:** Dresden and Aachen have implemented compatible Java Tor clients, and researchers use it to study anonymity.
- **Recognition and Adoption:** Chosen as the anonymity layer for the EU PRIME project, with over 200,000 active users. PC World magazine named Tor one of the Top 100 Products of 2005.

## 2. Anonymity Serves Different Interests for Different User Groups
- **Private Citizens:** Privacy
- **Governments:** Network Security
- **Businesses:** Traffic-Analysis Resistance

## 3. Simple Designs and Their Limitations
- **Single Relay Approach:** Uses a single relay to hide connections, but this is a single point of failure.
- **Multiple Relays:** Adding multiple relays ensures that no single relay can betray the user. A corrupt first hop can tell that Alice is talking, but not to whom. A corrupt final hop can tell that someone is talking to Bob, but not who.

## 4. Attacker Strategies
- **Blocking Users from Connecting to the Tor Network:**
  - By blocking directory authorities.
  - By blocking all server IP addresses in the directory.
  - By filtering based on Tor's network fingerprint.

## 5. Goals for Blocking Resistance
- **Attract and Utilize More Relay Addresses:** Normalize Tor's network fingerprint and solve the discovery problem.
- **Maintain Anonymity Properties:** Ensure that any new features do not compromise existing anonymity properties.

## 6. Adversary Assumptions (Threat Model)
- **Strong Attacker Defense:** Aim to defend against strong attackers, which inherently defends against weaker ones.
- **Diverse User Base:** Consider various users, including citizens in countries like China and Thailand, whistleblowers in corporate networks, and future oppressive situations.
- **Different Stages of the Arms Race:** Attackers will be at different stages of the arms race.

## 7. Attacker's Goals
- **Restrict Information Flow:** Focus on embarrassing or opposing information.
- **Behavioral Deterrence:** Create the impression that online activities are monitored.
- **Selective Blocking:** No need to block every circumvention tool, just the popular and effective ones.
- **Economic and Political Incentives:** Censors have incentives not to block the entire Internet but may cause collateral damage.

## 8. Main Network Attacks
- **IP Address Blocking:** At the firewall level.
- **Keyword Searching:** In TCP packets.
- **DNS Interception:** Providing bogus responses or redirects.

## 9. Design Assumptions
- **Limited Firewall Resources:** Network firewalls have limited CPU and memory per connection.
- **Time Lag in Information Sharing:** Often by commercial providers of filtering tools.
- **Non-Uniform Censorship:** Varies within each country due to different ISP policies.
- **Influence Across Borders:** Attackers can influence other countries and companies to help with censorship.
- **User Trust:** Assume users' hardware and software are not compromised and they can fetch a genuine copy of Tor.

## 10. Tor's Anonymity Properties
- **Local Network Protection:** A local network attacker cannot learn or influence your destination.
- **Relay Isolation:** No single router can link you to your destination.
- **Destination Privacy:** The destination cannot learn your location.

## 11. Other Tor Design Features
- **Discovery Mechanism:** Well-analyzed and well-understood, with directory authorities automatically aggregating, testing, and publishing signed summaries of available routers.
- **Flexibility:** The list of directory authorities is not hard-wired, allowing for the creation of separate Tor networks.
- **Path Management:** Tor automatically builds, rebuilds, and rotates paths as needed.
- **Role Separation:** Internal relays and exit relays are distinct, increasing the number of relays and enhancing anonymity.
- **Sustainability:** Tor has a community of developers and volunteers, making it sustainable and open-source.
- **Diverse User Base:** Hundreds of thousands of users, including ordinary citizens, activists, corporations, and government entities.

## 12. Anonymity and Censorship-Resistance
- **Example:** A Chinese worker blogging about factory issues through her uncle's computer in Ohio.
- **Relay Vulnerabilities:** Any relay can expose dissident bloggers or compile user behavior profiles, leading to attacks on relays or spreading suspicion.

## 13. Relay versus Discovery
- **Proxying Schemes:** Comprise a relay component (building circuits and sending traffic) and a discovery component (learning available routers).
- **Centrally Controlled Proxies:** Existing commercial anonymizers use centrally controlled single-hop proxies, which offer weak security compared to distributed-trust systems.
