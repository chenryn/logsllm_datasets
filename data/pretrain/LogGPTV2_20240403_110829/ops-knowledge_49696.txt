Question: "A cybersecurity analyst is reviewing the network traffic logs and observes unusual patterns that suggest a multi-stage command and control (C2) communication. The analyst identifies that a remote access tool (RAT) on a compromised host has been calling back to an IP address associated with a known threat actor. Further investigation reveals that the RAT has updated itself and uploaded a second RAT, which started communicating with a different IP address. Considering typical adversary behaviors, which of the following actions should the analyst prioritize to effectively respond to this threat? (Select TWO.)"
 "A": "Monitor for any backup first-stage callbacks or fallback channels that may be used if the primary communication path is blocked."
 "B": "Immediately shut down all outbound network traffic to prevent any further communication with external servers."
 "C": "Review the host's network connections to detect any new, untrusted connections that have been established."
 "D": "Ignore the second RAT since it likely performs less critical functions than the first-stage RAT."
Answer: AC
