ABSTRACT
Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is used in smart grid systems
to maintain the grid’s frequency to a nominal value. Cyber-attacks
such as time delay and false data injection on the tie-line power flow,
frequency measurements, and Area Control Error (ACE) control
signals can cause frequency excursion that can trigger load shed-
ding, generators’ damage, and blackouts. Therefore, resilience and
detection of attacks are of paramount importance in terms of the
reliable operation of the grid. In contrast with the previous works
that overlook ACE resiliency, this paper proposes an approach for
cyber-attack detection and resiliency in the overall AGC process.
We propose a state estimation algorithm approach for the AGC
system by utilizing prior information based on Gaussian process
regression, a non-parametric, Bayesian approach to regression. We
evaluate our approach using the PowerWorld simulator based on
the three-area New England IEEE 39-bus model. Moreover, we uti-
lize the modified version of the New England ISO load data for
the three-area power system to create a more realistic dataset. Our
results clearly show that our resilient control system approach can
mitigate the system using predictive control and detect the attack
with a 100 percent detection rate in a shorter period using prior
auxiliary information.

scheduled values [7]. The control of the AGC mechanism relies on
geographically dispersed sensing devices that are remotely con-
trolled. The tie-line power flow between BA areas and frequency
measurements from these sensing devices are sent to supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and control centers.
State Estimation (SE) ensures the data measurement integrity for
power flow, and frequency measurements and Bad Data Detection
(BDD) algorithm are applied. SE can reduce measurement noise
and detect faulty sensor data. However, Area Control Error (ACE)
measurement, an integral part of the AGC algorithm, is vulnerable
to integrity attacks due to no estimation mechanism for such mea-
surements. Such underlying vulnerability may significantly degrade
system performance under cyber-attacks; false data injection and
time delay attacks over the communication channels may mislead
the AGC performance, triggering improper actions such as load
shedding and even cascading outages.
The Department of Homeland security and the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends Intrusion Detec-
tion Systems (IDS) and De-militarized zones to protect the critical
infrastructures [4, 5]. Implementing these technologies in Informa-
tion Technology (IT) is well understood; however, much of what
is known about the applicability to the AGC is still anecdotal due
to the intrinsic constraints such as stringent timing requirements,
non-synchronicity of signals, and other inescapable non-linearities.
In addition, the existing diagnosis approaches for attack-resilient
algorithms in AGC typically cover measurement noise and other
anomalous factors only in state estimation for tie-line power flow
and frequency measurements. Recent works focus on a model-based
AGC cyber-attack resiliency approach that involves correlating all
the required parameters. In [7], Zhang et al. proposed an attack im-
pact evaluation framework by utilizing stochastic system analysis
methods to evaluate the statistics of system state variables in the
AGC. However, the resilience and detection of cyber-attacks was
not the scope of the work. Similar to our work, Tan et al. [6] derived
an attack impact model consisting of a series of false data injec-
tions and developing an efficient algorithm to detect the attacks.
However, the work only considers the consistency between the ob-
served frequency deviation and the predicted frequency deviation
and ignores the ACE measurement integrity.
Contributions. Our aim in this paper is to introduce an ap-
proach for cyber-attack detection and resiliency in the AGC pro-
cess: Resiliency refers to the capability of a system to maintain low
estimation error under cyber-attacks. In this direction, we propose
a state estimation-based detection approach for the AGC system by
utilizing prior information based on Gaussian process regression,
a non-parametric, Bayesian approach to regression. We use the
information to boost state estimation and resiliency and enforce
properties about how the algorithm identifies the anomalous mea-
surements. Specifically, our approach utilizes the model-based and

data-driven algorithm to boost the resiliency and detection perfor-
mance: Properties of the model-based method and the accuracy
of the data-driven method provide further redundancy, which can
enhance the overall system performance. To validate our approach,
we used the PowerWorld simulator based on the three-area New
England IEEE 39-bus model. Furthermore, we also utilized and mod-
ified the New England ISO load data for a 3-area power system to
create a more realistic dataset.
2 AGC RESILIENCE USING PRIOR
INFORMATION
This section presents the AGC model details adopted in this work.
Furthermore, we provide the prior model and anomaly detection
engine estimation, seeking to correlate between tie-line power flow,
frequency, and ACE measurements. Lastly, we present the threat
model.
System Model. As in the smart grid AGC literature, we consider
a standard electric power AGC system; where the function of the
system is to maintain the system frequency at its nominal value, e.g.,
60 Hz in North America, and to regulate the net scheduled value of
power flow across different BAs. The state variables are represented
by the system’s tie-line power flow and frequency measurements:
The AGC controller computes the ACE using these measurements
after receiving them over a communication network. For the 𝑖𝑡ℎ
area, 𝐴𝐶𝐸𝑖 = 𝑎𝑖 · 𝑃𝐸𝑖 + 𝑏𝑖 · 𝑓𝑖, where 𝑃𝐸𝑖 and 𝑓𝑖 are the 𝑖𝑡ℎ area’s
power export and frequency deviation of the grid, whereas 𝑎𝑖 and
𝑏𝑖 are the constants. The ACE values are sent to the generators
to adjust the primary control loop set-points, and the process is
repeated every 2-4 seconds, also referred to as the AGC cycle.
Prior Model. The objective of the prior model is to provide an
extra layer of resiliency to the AGC system. We use auxiliary models
such as transformer ratings, historical information of generator ca-
pacity, statistical characterization of tie-line power flow, frequency,
and ACE values to map them with the real-time measurements
by building Gaussian process regression with hyper-parameters
tuning in the machine learning algorithms and data pre-processing
tool known as Weka. Specifically, the prior information and load
data are fed into our proposed model to correlate with the forecast
values of power flow, frequency, and ACE values.
Anomaly detection Engine Estimation. We now describe
how our approach instantiates each of the phases in the cyber-
attack detection and resilience architecture. Figure 1 presents a con-
ceptual diagram of our proposed model for the AGC. Throughout
the resilient control and detection mechanism, we integrate model-
based and data-driven techniques to boost the performance of our
proposed approach: We use Gaussian Process for the data-driven
scheme for the predicted estimation of the AGC relevant measure-
ments. The final ACE measurement is correlated with the prior
information to identify any anomalous measurements throughout
the real-time process. If the ACE value does not get to zero due to
any frequency fault or cyber-attack, the system utilizes the prior
auxiliary information to compute the probability of the error and
compare it with the real-time values. For liveness, the framework
relies on the sum of two terms: The significant difference between
the actual and forecasted values; and the temporal characterization
of the control signal to identify the cyber-attacks such as ramp at-
tacks where the adversary gradually deviates the system frequency
to conceal the attack.
Threat model. We can envision that an adversary has gained
initial access to the communication system via social engineering
techniques. Next, an adversary can mount time delay attacks be-
tween the controller and actuator to delay control commands. For
example, an attacker can compromise a communication path such
as a router to delay the control commands. Similarly, adversaries
can access remote sensors to mount false data injection attacks on
power flow measurements. In this scenario, the attacker tries to
provide a wrong perception of the system load. For example, the at-
tacker can trick any area of AGC into believing that the power flow
has increased/decreased; the action can cause the incorrect compu-
tation of an ACE value sent to the generators. Consequently, the
wrong ACE value sent to the generator will falsely ramp up/down
the generator. Any of the mentioned scenarios can adversely impact
the performance of the AGC system, which can cause generation
imbalance and destabilize systems’ frequency.
3 EVALUATION - AGC AND SIMULATION
SETTINGS
To evaluate our approach, we conduct PowerWorld [2] simula-
tions - an industry-class high-class fidelity simulator – based on the
three-area New England IEEE 39-bus model [1]. The complete sys-
tem contains 10 generators with the same value of nominal power
1000 MVA, 19 loads, and 39 buses. Furthermore, each generator is
equipped with 4 second AGC cycle length and Multi-Band Power
System Stabilizer (MBPSS). Frequency deviation and the measure-
ment of tie-line active power exchanged are utilized to compute the
ACE. Moreover, we collect frequency values locally using a rotor
speed deviation of all generators; frequency is a global signal that
does not have significant variations throughout the power system,
and a rotor speed deviation is equal to a frequency deviation.
To validate our approach, we consider two simulation scenar-
ios: The first is a false data injection to the tine-line power flow
measurements in which we increase the power flow values with
small magnitude to cause grid frequency fluctuations; in the second
scenario, we consider the delay of ACE values to the generators
in which we employ the OpenSSL 1.0.1 to mimic a control center
