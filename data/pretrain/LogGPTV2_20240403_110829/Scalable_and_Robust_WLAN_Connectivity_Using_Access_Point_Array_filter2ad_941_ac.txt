CGI interface to modify the black list of an AP. Normally
commercial APs require WLB to provide some credentials
such as password along with this CGI request. Therefore
the WLAN AP array operator needs to conﬁgure WLB with
proper credentials so that it can modify the black list of the
APs. The above scheme has been shown to work for com-
modity APs such as Linksys 802.11b APs and commod-
ity STAs such as Cisco 802.11b cards, Prism2 based cards
including NETGEAR 802.11b cards and Linksys 802.11b
cards.
To measure the handoff latency, we set up three APs
that operate in Channel 1, 6 and 11, and monitoring the
frames exchanged in the air. The measured handoff latency
is around 1.3 second, the major part of which is due to
channel scanning. After a STA is put in the black list of
an AP, the AP sends a deauthentication frame to the STA,
which then starts its channel scanning process. The channel
scanning process takes around 0.5 second. After channel
scanning, the STA attempts to associate with the best AP it
ﬁnds. If its request is denied, the STA initiates another un-
necessary channel scanning, which again takes 0.5 second.
Then STA stops channel scanning and tries each AP one
by one. This takes less than 0.3 second. The second chan-
nel scanning in the above procedure appears unnecessary.
If it is removed, the handoff latency could be decreased to
around 0.8 second. Furthermore, other fast link-layer hand-
off schemes [14] could further reduce this handoff delay.
The 1.3-second handoff latency results in 1.6 second to 2.4
second disruption to TCP trafﬁc in our performance tests.
But TCP connection is maintained since this handoff is only
at layer-2.
3.6. Effects of STAs with Different Transmission
Rates
It is possible that even when the load across APs is bal-
anced, there is still room to further improve the aggregate
throughput. Assume there are four STAs, STA1, STA2,
STA3 and STA4, and two access points, AP1 and AP2.
STA1 and STA3 operate at 1 Mbps, and STA2 and STA4
operate at 11 Mbps. All four STAs are downloading big
ﬁles through their APs.
In the ﬁrst conﬁguration, STA1
and STA2 are associated with AP1, and STA3 and STA4
are associated with AP2. In this case, the trafﬁc load from
each STA is around 0.72 Mbps and the aggregate through-
put of these two APs is 2.88 Mbps. In the second conﬁgu-
ration, STA1 and STA3 are associated with AP1, and STA2
and STA4 are associated with AP2. In this case, the traf-
ﬁc load from STA1 and STA3 is around 0.409 Mbps, the
trafﬁc load from STA2 and STA4 is around 2.68 Mbps, and
the aggregate throughput of these two APs is around 6.18
Mbps, which is 2.14 times faster than that of the ﬁrst con-
ﬁguration. The throughput difference between these two
conﬁgurations is due to the fact that the 802.11 MAC proto-
col provides only frame-level fairness but not channel time
fairness [10].
In the ﬁrst conﬁguration, each AP has a
slow STA and a fast STA. Because of frame-level fairness,
the two STAs send/receive approximately the same number
of frames. As a result, the slow STA actually consumes
roughly 10 times more channel time than the fast STA, and
each AP’s throughput is reduced to 1.44 Mbps.

Analytically, assume there are n APs, each AP having
two STAs, one of which sends at rate 1 and the other at rate
F , where F is greater than 1. The slow STA of each AP
uses F

of the channel time. So each STA’s trafﬁc load is around
F +1 , each AP’s throughput is 2F
F +1 , and the total through-
put of n APs is 2nF
F +1 . At the other extreme, all slow STAs

are assigned to one AP and all fast STAs are assigned to the
remaining APs. In this case, one AP’s throughput is 1 and
all other APs’ throughput is F . With n APs, the throughput
improvement of this conﬁguration over the previous one is
1 + (n − 1) ∗ F over 2nF
F +1 . For a three-AP 802.11b-based
array, n is 3, F is 11 and the factor of throughput improve-
ment is about 4. For a twelve-AP 802.11a-based array, n is
12, F is 54 , and the factor of throughput improvement is
around 25.
If there is only one AP, the performance degradation due
to low-rate STA or “bad ﬁsh” is inevitable. But with the pro-
posed WLAN AP array, it is possible to mitigate this prob-
lem by assigning all slow STAs to one AP and fast STAs
to the remaining APs. Furthermore, WLB also checks if
a STA’s transmission rate is changed after it is assigned to
a new AP. When this is the case, the STA will not be as-
signed to that AP for a conﬁgurable period of time. This
check makes sure that load balancing will not turn any STA
into a “bad ﬁsh.” This performance test demonstrates that
a single low-rate STA could drastically decrease the aggre-
gate throughput of a WLAN. Such a “bad ﬁsh” could arise
because a STA happens to be in a corner with poor radio
condition, or because a malicious attacker intentionally sets
his STA’s transmission rate to a low value. Therefore, the
proposed WLAN array could signiﬁcantly improve the con-
nectivity robustness of a WLAN network even in the pres-
ence of poor conﬁguration or malicious attacks.
3.7. Fault Tolerance
With a n-AP array, up to n − 1 APs can fail before
the STAs are completely disconnected. However, because
WLB uses a black-list approach for changing AP-STA as-
sociation, a STA cannot re-associate itself with other APs
before the black list is changed by WLB. So WLB needs
to detect AP failure so that it can reassign its STAs to other
APs. WLB detects an AP’s wired connectivity failure by ac-
tively probing the AP periodically and wireless malfunction
by passively monitoring the AP’ beacon frames. The obser-
vation period for wireless malfunction is set to be 1 second,
because normally the beacon interval is 0.1 second. So a
false positive is possible only when up to 10 consecutive
beacons are lost. The wired connectivity probing interval is
initially 1 second. When there is no response, the probing is
sent every 0.1 second for 3 times. If none of these probes get
any response, the AP is considered dead. So the wired con-
nectivity failure detection time is 1.3 second. When an AP
experiences wireless malfunction, its STAs can automati-
cally detect it and change to other APs after they are reas-
signed to a new AP. The time for a STA to detect a wireless
malfunction failure varies from 3 to 5 seconds. In the case
that an AP encounters a wired connectivity failure, its STAs
cannot detect the failure automatically and will continue to
associate with this AP. Because WLB cannot control this
AP via wired network, WLB switches its WLAN interface
from RF monitor mode to STA mode, associates itself with
the AP, and commands it to block all its currently associated
STAs. Finally, it assigns each of these STAs to a new AP. By
continuously monitoring the status of failed APs, WLB can

4. Performance Evaluation
4.1. Testbed Setup
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed WLAN
load balancing algorithm, we set up a testbed as follows.
One computer, source-computer, simulates servers on In-
ternet from which STAs download data. There are 9 STAs,
STA1 to STA9, which are the trafﬁc sinks, and can be as-
sociated with any one of the 3 APs, AP1, AP2, or AP3.
The WLB, which implements the proposed load balanc-
ing algorithm, the three APs, and source-computer are con-
nected to a 100 Mbps Ethernet switch. The STAs, source-
computer and WLB run Linux 2.4.20. The WLAN cards on
STAs are NETGEAR 802.11b WLAN PCI card that uses
the ORiNOCO driver. The three APs are Linksys WAP11,
are positioned as a triangle, with their pairwise distance be-
ing 1 meter, and operate in Channel 1, 6 and 11, respec-
tively. The distance between STAs and APs is less than 15
meters. So radio signal quality is not an issue. The control
interval of WLB is 5 seconds. α is 10% which allows WLB
to tolerate around 500 Kbps imbalance before taking action.
4.2. Baseline Test
First we measure the maximum throughput of each AP
and use it as the baseline case for comparison. STAs are
divided into 3 groups. Each group has 3 STAs and is as-
signed to one AP. STA1, STA2 and STA3 are assigned to
AP1. STA4, STA5 and STA6 are assigned to AP2. STA7,
STA8 and STA9 are assigned to AP3. We call this conﬁg-
uration as static load balancing (SLB) conﬁguration for all
the following tests. Source-computer pumped data to STAs
as fast as TCP allows.
We created 3 TCP connections from source-computer to
each of the 3 STAs associated with a single AP, and mea-
sured the maximum throughput that these three connections
can carry. By pumping trafﬁc through each AP one by one,
we can measure each AP’s maximum throughput without
inter-channel interference, as there is only one active AP
(channel) at any point in time. Measurements in the sec-
ond and third column of Table 1 show that each AP can get
