ABSTRACT
During early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly spread
worldwide, forcing many governments to impose strict lock-
down measures to tackle the pandemic. This significantly
changed people’s mobility and habits, subsequently impact-
ing how they use telecommunication networks. In this pa-
per, we investigate the effects of the COVID-19 emergency
on a UK Mobile Network Operator (MNO). We quantify the
changes in users’ mobility and investigate how this impacted
the cellular network usage and performance. Our analysis
spans from the entire country to specific regions, and geode-
mographic area clusters. We also provide a detailed analysis
for London. Our findings bring insights at different geo-
temporal granularity on the status of the cellular network,
from the decrease in data traffic volume in the cellular net-
work and lower load on the radio network, counterposed to
a surge in the conversational voice traffic volume.

1 INTRODUCTION
After the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the province of Wuhan
(China) in December 2019, the virus rapidly spread to neigh-
boring countries and to the rest of the world. It was de-

Emergency on January 30th, 2020 and a pandemic on March
11th, 2020 (week 11 of 2020). As a result, different countries
have implemented a variety of interventions to contain the
virus. These included forced or recommended confinement,
intended to reduce transmission by reducing contact rates be-
tween individuals[24]. These policies resulted in a dramatic
change in human mobility, which in turn affected the traffic
patterns and operations in telecommunication networks.
In this paper, we focus on the cellular network of O2 UK,
and evaluate how the changes in people’s mobility impacted
this Mobile Network Operator (MNO) traffic patterns. The
coronavirus outbreak reached the UK on January 31st 2020,
when the first two (imported) cases with the respiratory
disease COVID-19 were confirmed in York. On March 16th
2020 (week 12 of 2020), the government recommended all
citizens to work from home, and on March 20th (also week
12), it implemented the closure of sporting events, schools,
restaurants, bars and gyms.1 On the 23rd of March (week 13),
the government imposed a lockdown on the whole popula-
tion, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people
outside the home. London was particularly affected by the
outbreak, with 27,000 positive cases at the end of May[18].
We collect and analyze statistics on the operational status
of the MNO network, and our main findings are as follow.
By analyzing cellular network signalling information re-
garding users’ device mobility activity, we observe a decrease
of 50% in mobility (according to different mobility metrics)
in the UK during the lockdown period. We find no correla-
tion between this reduction in mobility and the number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases, showing that only the enforced
government order was effective in significantly reducing
mobility. We observe this reduction is more significant in
densely populated urban areas than in rural areas. We further
note regional differences in how people relax the mobility
restrictions, with an increase in mobility in London and West

the year for brevity.
Yorkshire in weeks 18-19. For London, specifically, we ob-
serve that approximately 10% of the residents temporarily
relocated during the lockdown.
We find that these mobility changes have immediate im-
plications in traffic patterns of the cellular network. The
downlink data traffic volume aggregated for all bearers (in-
cluding conversational voice) decreased for all UK by up to
25% during the lockdown period. This correlates with the re-
duction in mobility we observe country-wide, which results
in people likely relying more on the broadband residential
Internet access to run download intensive applications such
as video streaming. We also note a decrease in the radio cell
load, with a reduction of approximately 15% across the UK
after the stay-at-home order, which further corroborates the
drop in cellular connectivity usage. This effect is consistent
with the reported surge in traffic for residential ISPs. This
decrease rewound the traffic load on the MNO infrastructure
by one year, to levels similar to those of March 2019.
The total uplink data traffic volume, on the other hand,
experienced little changes (between -7% and +1,5%) during
lockdown. This is mainly due to the increase of 4G voice
traffic (i.e., VoLTE) across the UK that peaked at 150% after
lockdown compared to the national medial value before the
pandemic, thus compensating the decrease in data traffic
in the uplink. At the same time, we observe an increase of
more than 100% in the downlink packet loss error rate for
voice traffic on week 10 and 11. This was caused by excess
of congestion in the interconnection infrastructure MNOs
use to exchange voice traffic, whose capacity was exceeded
during the steep surge of voice traffic. The error rate reverted
its previous levels during the following weeks thanks to rapid
response of the network operations.
Finally, we observe mobility changes have different im-
pact on network usage in geodemographic area clusters. In
densely populated urban areas, we observe a significantly
higher decrease of mobile network usage (i.e., downlink and
uplink traffic volumes, radio load and active users) than in ru-
ral areas. By looking into the case of London, we observe that
this is likely due to geodemographics of the central districts
(e.g., Eastern-Central(EC) and Western-Central (WC)), which
include many seasonal residents (e.g., tourists), business and
commercial areas.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
we describe the measurement infrastructure, as well as the
data feeds and the metrics used. In Section 3, we describe
the evolution in mobility observed throughout the lockdown
imposed in March and April. Then, in Section 4, we describe
the changes observed in different parameters representative
of the MNO’s network performance in the UK and specif-
ically for the case of London. Next, we present the related
work and conclude the paper.

2 DATASET
In this section, we describe the measurement infrastructure
we leverage for collecting network data from a large com-
mercial MNO in the UK (with more than 25% market share
in the UK in 2019) . We detail the dataset we built and the
metrics we use to capture the activity of smartphone devices.
2.1 Measurement Infrastructure
The cellular network we study supports 2G, 3G and 4G mo-
bile communication technologies. In Figure 1, we illustrate a
high-level schema of the MNO architecture. Such a network
can be simplified to consist of three main domains: (i) the
cellular device (in our case, the smartphone used as primary
device by end-users), (ii) the Radio Access Network (RAN)
and (iii) the Core Network (CN).
Our passive measurement approach relies on commercial
solutions the MNO integrates within its infrastructure. The
red pins in Figure 1 mark the network elements that we mon-
itor, namely the Mobility Management Entity (MME), the
Message Sequence Chart (MSC), the Serving GPRS Support
Node (SGSN)/Serving Gateway (SGW), and the Cell Sites.
We collect control plane information for both voice and data
traffic from the total population of devices connected to the
MNO’s radio network, as well as Key Performance Indica-
tors (KPI) of cell sites.
Cell Sites. Cell sites (also called cell towers) are the sites
where antennas and equipment of the RAN are placed. Every
cell site hosts one or multiple antennas for one or more
technologies (i.e., 2G, 3G, 4G), and includes multiple cells
and sectors. For every cell site we have detailed information
including location, radio technologies available, number of
cells and radio sectors. We collect KPI for every radio sectors
(e.g., radio load, average user throughput, traffic volume)
that we aggregate at postcode level or larger granularity.

We capture and process logs reporting
on activities on the lu-PS (for 3G) and Gb (for 2G) interfaces,
which carry events related to data packet transmissions and
mobility management. Similarly, for the LTE networks, we
capture the logs at the MME nodes on the S1 interface, re-
porting on mobility management events and bearer manage-
ment, and user plane S1-UP interface for data and voice (over
data) events. We also capture and process logs that report
on events on the lu-CS (for 3G) and A (for 2G) interfaces,
for 2G and 3G voice events. Note that the A interfaces also
carries mobility management information. For the complete
detailed specifications, we direct the reader to [1].
2.2 Data Feeds
From our measurement infrastructure, we capture various
data feeds from the mobile network that we describe next.
Note that these feeds are aggregated at postcode level or
larger granularity.
General Signaling Dataset. As described in the previous
section, we capture the activity of the users in the control
plane for the different Radio Access Technologys (RATs) sup-
ported by the cellular provider. Specifically, for every RAT,
the signalling dataset we collect includes the (control plane)
signaling messages related to events triggered by the MNO’s
subscribers, including Attach, Authentication, Session es-
tablishment, Dedicated bearer establishment and deletion,
Tracking Area Update (TAU), ECM-IDLE mode transition,
Service request, Handover and Detach. Each event we cap-
ture carries the anonymized user ID, Subscriber Identity
Module (SIM) Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Net-
work Code (MNC), Type Allocation Code (TAC) (the first 8
digits of the device IMEI, which are statically allocated to
device vendors), the radio sector ID handling the communi-
cation, timestamp, and event result code (success / failure).
Further, we aggregate this information at postcode level or
larger granularity.
