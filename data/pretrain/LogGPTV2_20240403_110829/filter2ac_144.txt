### Title: Action Bias and the Two Most Dangerous Words in Cybersecurity

Most cybersecurity professionals recognize that achieving perfect security is an unattainable goal. Despite this, they often strive for perfection, leading to feelings of loss, failure, and regret when incidents inevitably occur. Human instinct, particularly in response to a crisis, is to react forcefully and immediately. In this session, we will explore action bias and discuss when immediate action is appropriate and when it can be counterproductive.

Behavioral science has shown that action bias can lead to wasteful spending and suboptimal outcomes. We will examine how action bias affects users, security professionals, and leaders. For example, users may demand password resets and virus scans even when there is no evidence of a hack, a behavior that attackers often exploit in phishing campaigns. Similarly, CISOs and other security leaders may act hastily following a breach or attack, driven by a sense of urgency and a need for control, rather than conducting a deliberate analysis. This can result in implementing costly defenses that may not be justified by the value or the potential loss.

We will present countermeasures to mitigate the occurrence and impact of action bias, based on behavioral science research. While cognitive biases cannot be entirely eliminated, tools such as "pre-flight" checklists and pre-mortems (commonly used in risk management) can help reduce their negative effects. By adopting these tools, the cybersecurity community can better address the two most dangerous words in the field: "never again." These words are often spoken in desperation, even when incidents recur, but with the right strategies, we can make more rational and unbiased decisions.

Through this session, we aim to provide actionable insights and practical tools to help cybersecurity professionals navigate the challenges of action bias and make more informed, effective decisions.
