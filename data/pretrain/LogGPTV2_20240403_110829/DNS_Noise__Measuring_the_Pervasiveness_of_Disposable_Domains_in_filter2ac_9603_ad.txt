1) Domain Name Tree Builder: This module processes
the full passive DNS dataset for the system. Its main func-
tionalities are: i) to assemble the daily domain name tree,
and ii) to gather the cache hit rate information for RRs of the
resolved domain names. In the domain name tree, we can
easily get the depth of black nodes, so when necessary, it can
efﬁciently gather domain names and provide the correspond-
ing Tree Structure Features and Cache Hit Rate Features.
2) Disposable Domain Classiﬁer: The classiﬁer module
traverses the domain name tree and classiﬁes the set of
domain names in the full passive DNS dataset for a single
day. The mining process is composed of two main parts.
First, the Algorithm 1 starts with all the effective 2LDs in the
domain name tree. Then the algorithm identiﬁes groups of
black descendants with the same depth under a zone. Next,
the algorithm will generate the corresponding sets Gk and
Lk for all possible depth values of k (Line 4, Algorithm 1).
Second, the mining process will produce a new statistical
model from known zones that facilitate resolutions for
disposable domains. And the classiﬁer will classify all the
groups in an effort to identify new disposable domain names
(Line 6 to 14). Based on a predeﬁned classiﬁcation
threshold (90% similar to the modeling class, Line 5 of
Algorithm 1), the classiﬁer will provide a set of classiﬁcation
results for all currently unknown domain names (Line
7). If any group is classiﬁed as disposable, nodes in the
group are decolored in the tree (Line 9 to 11), and the
disposable zone for the group is sent for output (Line 12).
Depending on the classiﬁcation results of each group, the
Algorithm 1 will either stop (Line 1 to 3) or recursively

the classiﬁer be C(Gk) = (p, class), where p
is the probability of Gk that belongs to class. For
our training dataset, we use zones manually veriﬁed to
facilitate disposable and non-disposable domain names. The
disposable class contains 398 zones, and the non-disposable
class includes 401 2LD zones, as discussed in Section IV-B.
The training dataset for our classiﬁer contains a small set of
zones in disposable class, which might cause the classiﬁer
to be biased; however, we should note that this is the ﬁrst
time that anyone has labeled zones as disposable. Thus, we
had to manually label every single zone in the disposable
class by inspecting thousands even millions of domain
names under each zone. The label
in the classiﬁcation
process could be “disposable” or “negative” and it will be
accompanied by a conﬁdence score between zero and one.
For example, if the label is “disposable” with conﬁdence
close to one, this means that domains under the zone with
the same depth k are likely to be disposable. Then, we go
through all the sub-zones under the inspection zone in the
same way, excluding the nodes deemed as “disposable”, and
see if there exists a sub-zone used for disposable domains.
Algorithm 1 shows the exact steps of the disposable
domain name mining process. Using the example domains
from Figure 8 as context,
to Algorithm 1 is
example.com. We differentiate the nodes as black or
white nodes as we discussed in Section V-A1 and we
proceed with the feature computation process. At this point
for zone example.com we have G3, G4, G5 sets and the
corresponding statistical vectors. We classify them against
an already trained model and we receive the conﬁdence
i.e., each set Gk. Assuming

Our measurement results are summarized in Figure 11,
and we will describe the results in detail in this section.
Using traditional model selection methods [24] over
the training dataset, we chose LAD decision tree 3 as the
disposable domain name classiﬁer C. The classiﬁers we
used in our model selection process in addition to LAD
were Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks

and Logistic Regression. To evaluate the accuracy of the
classiﬁer, we used the standard 10-fold cross validation
methodology [24] on the training dataset. Figure 12
demonstrates the ROC curve of the disposable class for the
LAD tree model. Using θ = 0.9 as our threshold, we obtain
a true positive rate of 92.4% and a very low false positive
rate of 0.6%. If we use the default threshold of θ = 0.5, we
have a 1% false positive rate and a 97% true positive rate.
The disposable zone miner was run over 6 days worth of
data from one recursive DNS cluster at the North American
ISP. Using the fpDNS datasets from these 6 days4, we obtain
classiﬁcation results over the unknown portion of the dataset.
Over the 6 day period, we found 14,488 zones that use
disposable domains, which are under 12,397 unique 2LDs,
with a conﬁdence of more than 90%. On average, there are
7 periods in disposable domains, indicating that disposable
domains tend to be longer than normal domain names.
1) Prevalence: Disposable domains are widely used
including popular websites (e.g.,
by various industries,
Google, Microsoft), Anti-Virus companies (e.g., McAfee,
Sophos, Sonicwall, Mailshell), DNSBLs (e.g., Spamhaus,
countries.nerd.dk),
Facebook,
Myspace), streaming services (e.g., Netﬂix), P2P services
(e.g., Skype), cookie tracking services (e.g., Esomniture,

e-commerce business
etc.
Figure 11 illustrates some examples of labeled disposable
zones and newly found disposable zones.
(e.g., Paypal, ClickBank),
Of the 14,488 disposable zones, we veriﬁed that 91
(0.6%) of them were related to content delivery networks
(CDNs). We used a customized list containing 451 CDN
2LDs to analyze the result and found that these 91 zones
are under 24 (5.3%) 2LDs. It is probably because of some
extremely unpopular content being served under speciﬁc
CDN sub-zones, making the domains appear as disposable
in our network. These could be false positives or a result of
different level of services provided by CDNs. Since only a
small percentage (0.6%) of disposable zones are CDN zones,
there is a new class of (disposable) domain names that
should be clearly differentiated from CDN related trafﬁc.
2) Growth: Disposable domains are not only widely
used currently, but are also increasingly being used.
Figure 13 shows that for unique domains seen in daily
trafﬁc below the recursives the percentage of disposable
domains increased from 23.1% to 27.6%. Also, of the
daily resolved unique domains the percentage of disposable
domains grew from 27.6% to 37.2% over the year of 2011.
From trafﬁc during 11/28/2011 to 12/10/2011, we observe
that the number of new disposable domains seen every day
is always high, around 5 million to 7 million. However,
the number of new non-disposable domains dropped from
13 million to 1.6 million. So after one day, more than
50% of new domains seen daily are disposable, and after
