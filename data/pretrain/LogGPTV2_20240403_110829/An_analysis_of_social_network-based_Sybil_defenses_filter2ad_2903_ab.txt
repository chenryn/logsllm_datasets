2.4 Rest of the paper
In this section, we have shown that existing Sybil defense
schemes all work by inducing an implicit ranking of the
nodes. We now take a closer look at these rankings, us-
Figure 2: Diagram showing the processes involved in
a Sybil defense scheme. In brief, the scheme itself
can be split into an algorithm, which when given
a social network and a trusted node, produces a
ranking. The parameters to the scheme are used
to create a cutoﬀ, which deﬁnes a Sybil/non-Sybil
partitioning from the ranking.
365The results of this experiment are shown in the top graph
of Figure 4. For clarity, we only show the mutual infor-
mation between partitionings of SybilGuard and each of the
other three schemes (the other pairs are similar). The x-axis
denotes the size of the partition containing non-Sybils. For
example, the x-axis value of 10 divides the ranking into two
parts, one with the ﬁrst 10 nodes in the ranking (marked as
non-Sybils) and the other with the rest of the nodes (marked
as Sybils). Thus, Figure 4 shows the mutual information be-
tween pairs of rankings at all possible cutoﬀ points.
Figure 4 shows that the mutual information metric is max-
imized at a partitioning of size 256. Interestingly, it falls oﬀ
sharply before and after this cutoﬀ value. To understand
this plot better, we investigated the strong correlation be-
tween the diﬀerent node rankings at the partitioning size
of 256 and found that the 256 members that each scheme
assigned to the non-Sybil partition strongly corresponded
to the half of the network in Figure 4 that contained the
trusted node. This indicates that all schemes are biased
towards ranking nodes in the local community around the
trusted node higher than nodes outside of the community.
However, there is little correlation between the ordering of
nodes within the community, or the nodes outside of it, as
the mutual information is low between pairs of rankings be-
fore and after this point.
3.1.2 The common factor behind the rankings
One hypothesis that could explain our above observations is
that the nodes are being ranked such that nodes well con-
nected to the trusted node are more likely to be higher in the
rankings. Since there are several nodes within the local com-
munity of the trusted node that are equally well connected,
the ranking amongst these nodes is not strictly enforced,
i.e., the diﬀerent schemes rank these nodes diﬀerently. Sim-
ilarly, several nodes outside the local community are equally

observed at 256 nodes, indicating a high degree of
overlap between the partitionings, and a strong com-
munity structure in the non-Sybils, at this point.

ing them to compare the schemes across a wide range of
conditions. Our goal in the remaining sections is to better
understand the ranking algorithms underlying existing Sybil
defense schemes, and through this understanding, to provide
a basis for answering the following questions:
• Are the diﬀerent Sybil defense schemes performing the
core task of ranking nodes in the same way, or is each
ranking unique? (Section 3)
• Are there other (potentially better) ways to obtain
these node rankings? (Section 4)
• What structural properties of the social network de-
termine how well the schemes work? (Section 5.1)
• Are the schemes robust against the diﬀerent possible
Sybil attack strategies? (Section 5.2)
3. RANKINGS AND SYBIL DEFENSE
In this section, we develop a better understanding of the pro-
cess by which Sybil defense schemes compute node rankings
by comparing the rankings of the diﬀerent schemes.
3.1 Rankings in synthetic networks
We start by examining the node rankings generated by the
schemes when run over a synthetic network topology, taken
from [3] and shown in Figure 3. In brief, this network is con-
structed using the B´arab´asi-Albert preferential attachment
model [4], and then rewired3 to have two densely connected
communities of 256 nodes each, connected by a small num-
ber of edges.
3.1.1 Comparing node rankings
We randomly selected a node in one of the communities
as the trusted node and calculated the node rankings on
this synthetic network for the four Sybil defense schemes
previously discussed. We then examined how closely the
various rankings matched. To compare the rankings, we
use mutual information [28], which measures the similarity
of two partitionings of a set. In brief, mutual information
ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no correlation
between the partitionings, and 1 represents a perfect match.
3In brief, the rewiring works as follows: Nodes are ﬁrst ran-
domly assigned to two communities. Then, rewiring works
by selecting two links A ↔ B and C ↔ D where A and C are
in the same community and B and D are in the same com-
munity. These two links are replaced with the links A ↔ C
and B ↔ D, thereby increasing the intra-community links
without changing the degree distribution or link count.

poorly connected and so their relative ranking is not con-
sistent across the diﬀerent Sybil schemes. However, there
is a sharp distinction between the connectivity of nodes in-
side and outside the local community, and so the former are
ranked before the latter.
To conﬁrm this hypothesis, we used a well known metric
called conductance [16] for determining how closely a sub-
set of nodes within a network are connected among them-
selves relative to the rest of the network. Conductance is
a widely used metric for evaluating the quality of commu-
nities within large networks. In brief, the conductance of a
set of nodes ranges between 0 and 1, with lower numbers
indicating stronger communities.
We plot the conductance of the non-Sybil subset in the
bottom of Figure 4 and notice that there is a sharp inﬂec-
tion point in the conductance at 256 nodes for all schemes.
This corresponds to the boundary between the two com-
munities in our synthetic network topology. Adding nodes
from another community sharply increases the conductance,
so all schemes assign higher rankings to nodes from within
the community around the trusted node than to nodes from
outside the community. This helps explain why the parti-
tions obtained from the rankings match very well when the
cutoﬀ is set at the inﬂection point.
3.2 Rankings in real-world networks
In this section, we verify that the results we found for our
synthetic network also hold in real-world networks. First, we
wish to check that nodes are ranked in a biased manner, such
that nodes from the trusted node’s local community rank
higher than any other nodes. Second, we wish to test if the
point at which all Sybil defense schemes agree corresponds to
a trough in the conductance value, indicating the boundary
of the community around the trusted node.
To do show this, we repeat the experiment above for
two real world networks: Facebook, consisting of the social
network between Rice University graduate students taken
from Facebook [21], and Astrophysics, consisting of the co-
authorship network between astrophysicists [25]. Details on
these datasets are provided in Table 2.
As we can see in Figures 5 and 6, the mutual informa-
tion reveals a local cutoﬀ where all rankings have strong
correlation, and this cutoﬀ is also characterized by a low
conductance value. Taken together, our experiments show
that all Sybil defense schemes are identifying a local commu-
nity that surrounds the trusted node, but that the ranking
of nodes they use to reach the local community (and that
they use after this point) is not strongly correlated.
3.3 Summary of observations
We now summarize the ﬁndings from our comparison of the
way in which various algorithms rank nodes:
• The ranking of nodes is biased towards those which
decrease conductance. Thus, nodes that are tightly
connected around a trusted node (i.e., those that form
subsets with lower conductance) are more likely to be
ranked higher.
• When there are multiple nodes that are similarly well
connected to the trusted node (i.e., they form subsets
with similar conductance) they are often ordered dif-
ferently in diﬀerent algorithms.
• When the trusted node is located in a densely con-
nected community of nodes, with a clear boundary be-
tween this community and the rest of the network, the
nodes in the local community around the trusted node
are ranked before others.
4. APPLYING COMMUNITY DETECTION
In the previous section, we observed that all Sybil defense
schemes work by identifying nodes in the local commu-
nity around a given trusted node and ranking them as
more trustworthy than those outside.
In this section, we
examine whether algorithms that are explicitly designed
to detect communities, called community detection algo-
rithms [2, 3, 6, 19], can be used for Sybil defense in the same
manner as existing schemes. Our goal is to investigate the
367potential for leveraging existing literature in community de-
tection to defend against Sybils. To this end, we ﬁrst select
an oﬀ-the-shelf community detection algorithm and gener-
ate a node ranking from the algorithm. We then compare its
node ranking with those of existing Sybil defense schemes,
to determine if it is able to defend against Sybils with similar
accuracy.
4.1 Community detection
Community detection in networks is a well studied and ma-
ture ﬁeld. There are numerous approaches that use diﬀer-
ent mechanisms in order to detect communities and diﬀerent
metrics to evaluate the quality of communities. Below, we
give a brief overview of how community detection schemes
work.
