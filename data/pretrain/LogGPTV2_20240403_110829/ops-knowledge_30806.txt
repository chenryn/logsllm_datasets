User: I've installed virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper on Windows using easy_install. But mkvirtualenv is missing. I tried to search on my machine but I couldn't find it. I don't know how to solve it. Do you have any idea?
Assistant: mkvirtualenv is a bash script so you need to run bash shell to make use of it.
mkvirtualenv is a bash function in the mkvirtualenv_bashrc script
You will need to run this from cygwin under Windows. (You can call a native python from this and not need a cygwin python)
