### Is there an existing issue for this?

### Current Behavior
`package-lock.json` uses private verdaccio endpoint for the `resolved` field
as opposed to the NPM registry.
One work around for this is to do a find all and replace in the `package-
lock.json` whenever you run `npm i`. But that is a real hassle.
### Expected Behavior
There to be an option to not use the private verdaccio endpoint for the
`resolved` field so when other users run `npm i` they don't run into errors.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. Set `.npmjs` to `registry=http://thisismyprivateverdaccioendpoint.com/`
  2. Create a project (`npm init`)
  3. Run `npm i --save express` (or any package)
  4. Notice how `package-lock.json` will have the `resolved` property set to the registry set in `.npmjs`
  5. Send project to someone else without node_modules folder
  6. Have them run `npm i`
  7. Notice that there is an error
