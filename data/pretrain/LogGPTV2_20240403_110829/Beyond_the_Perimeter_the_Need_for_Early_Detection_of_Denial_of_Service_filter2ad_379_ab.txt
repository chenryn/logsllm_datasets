### Analysis of Positives vs. False Positives Recorded by the System

A positive is an instance where a recorded attack corresponds to an actual event of interest (EOI), whereas a false positive occurs when an event is incorrectly identified as an attack. Over a four-week period, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) recorded a total of 1493 attacks against the control computer. Of these, 409 were confirmed positives, and 1084 were false positives.

The 409 positives were primarily due to a significant number of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) port scans caused by an infection within the network perimeter by the Code Red worm. The Code Red worm [4] is a self-replicating malicious code that exploits vulnerabilities in Microsoft Web servers. An increase in internal network traffic, as illustrated by the bottom line in Figure 1, was attributed to the worm attempting to infect other servers by sending crafted HTTP GET requests, which exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability. During the research period, two infections were detected through the surge in network traffic activity.

### Impact on Network and Firewall

The initial infected machine's attempts to connect to the Internet routed all attack traffic to the firewall, the primary perimeter conduit to external networks. The firewall logged these attempts as suspicious and did not forward the traffic. However, the volume of suspicious connection requests filled the firewall's hard disks with audit information, eventually causing the firewall to crash. This failure prevented both valid and invalid traffic from passing through, denying external users access to key internal servers such as the main organizational web server and email servers. Internal users were also unable to connect to external services. The system remained inoperable for five days due to the lack of a timely backup plan and the need for system reconfiguration.

### Early Detection of DoS Attacks Beyond the Perimeter

Within the perimeter model, firewalls enforce security policies, and IDSs detect system misuses. However, both types of security devices have limitations in handling Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. First, all traffic must pass through the firewall, creating a bottleneck that can prevent legitimate traffic from reaching its destination. Second, by the time a DoS attack is detected, it has already flooded the target system with packets, achieving its objective.

The case study highlights the need for an approach that detects and responds to DoS attacks before they reach the target's perimeter. To achieve this, we must focus on the communication medium beyond the trusted network's perimeter. While the perimeter model allows us to define normal versus abnormal traffic in organizational security policies, early detection requires a different approach since we do not have the same level of control over behavior.

### Defining DoS Attacks for Early Detection

To facilitate early detection, we define a DoS attack as follows:
- **x distinct packets** matching **s signature** in **y seconds** to **h host**.

Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between these elements. Host **h** is the target of the DoS attack. Packets **x** represent the total number of packets directed at **h**, including both normal and abnormal traffic. The DoS attack packets **s** are those that match a specific attack signature. Time **y** is the duration over which packets are directed to **h**.

This definition allows us to focus on the communication-level behavior of DoS attacks, rather than their effects. By identifying packets that match a signature, we can detect DoS attacks early. Additionally, this approach helps address the problem of perimeter model devices, which log all packets, consuming valuable processing time and system resources.

### Characteristics of DoS Attacks

DoS attacks often involve a large amount of data sent to the victim to consume available bandwidth and prevent legitimate users from accessing resources. The success of a DoS attack increases with the duration of the attack, leading to a high rate of data transfer over time.

### Application of the Definition

When applying our approach to the traffic seen in Figure 3, we add a third dimension to the traffic view, allowing us to distinguish between an attack and a "flash crowd." The signatures used in early detection are more generic and combine various factors, such as a fixed packet size, single source IP address, and traffic directed to a single destination port. These signatures help identify the attack from the start until its termination.

### Distinguishing DoS Attacks from Other Traffic

Figure 5 shows a TCP SYN flood attack, where the signature axis helps determine that connections are not established, distinguishing attack traffic from a "flash crowd." For attacks involving a small number of packets or where total traffic throughput is high, our approach can still detect abnormal traffic by focusing on the characteristics of the attack, such as the constant sequence number in the initial SYN packets.

By using this approach, we can effectively detect and respond to DoS attacks before they reach the target's perimeter, ensuring the availability and integrity of the network.
