User: I have python in both /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin. Now I have this question that which one will execute if I call python?
I know that I can check with which python command to see which one is which one. But I'm asking which one would work by default?
Assistant: When you run anything on the command-line, it will search through the folders in the PATH variable, in order, until it finds an executable file with that name.
