User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题OS X Server .htaccess Error I am having a problem with OS X Server. I just bought it today, and I am getting a page like this when I connect:

Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.
Server unable to read htaccess file, denying access to be safe

Apache Server at localhost Port 34580


In my error log:

[Wed Sep 30 18:33:13.115898 2015] [core:crit] [pid 4386] (13)Permission denied: [client 127.0.0.1:51857] AH00529: /Users/user/Desktop/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable and that '/Users/user/Desktop/' is executable, referer: http://localhost/~user


I have created the .htaccess file and ran the command chmod 755 /Users/user/Desktop/.htaccess. Still having the same error.
Does anyone know why this would be happening?

Assistant: Try to add your localhost ip to your .htaccess file as OS X uses a reverse proxy.

Allow from 127.0.0.1        #osx reverse proxy
