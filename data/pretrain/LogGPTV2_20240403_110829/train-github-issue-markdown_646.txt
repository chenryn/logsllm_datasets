**Issue with TensorFlow Installation on Alpine 3.5 and Python 2.7**

I successfully installed TensorFlow using `pip` on Alpine 3.5 with Python 2.7. However, when I attempt to import TensorFlow, I encounter the following error:

```
ImportError: Error relocating /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so: __sprintf_chk: symbol not found
```
