• 
Use the NOT operator to exclude a particular term. Here’s an 
example: developer NOT designer.
• 
Use the OR operator to include one or more terms together. Here’s an 
example: developer OR designer (searches for either a developer or 
a designer or both).
• 
Use the AND operator to include two or more terms together. Here’s 
an example: developer AND designer (searches for both designer 
and developer). There’s no need to use the AND operator in your 
search because LinkedIn will add it automatically when you search 
for more than one term together; just enter a space between your 
search terms.
• 
Use parentheses to combine search terms. Here’s an example: 
penetration tester NOT (developer OR designer). This will search 
for a penetration tester and ignore both developer and designer from 
search results.
• 
You can leverage Google to search within LinkedIn using the Google 
site operator. Here’s an example: “Nihad Hassan” site:linkedin.com.
 Searching LinkedIn Using a Google Custom Search
Google custom search engines can become handy to retrieve some results that cannot 
be fetched easily using typical search engines. The following are a selected set of Google 
custom searches that prove useful in retrieving data from LinkedIn:
• 
Recently Updated Profiles (https://cse.google.com/cse/public
url?cx=009462381166450434430:luit7gbqx2a): This will retrieve 
recently updated profiles from LinkedIn.

• 
LinkedIn Contact Extractor (https://cse.google.com/cse/publi
curl?cx=001394533911082033616:tm5y1wqwmme): This will extract 
LinkedIn profiles that have their contacts publicly accessible. The 
extracted information includes the Contact, Email, Email2, and 
Email3 fields.
• 
LinkedIn Résumés (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=0
10561883190743916877:qa_v6ioerxo#gsc.tab=0): This will search 
for updated LinkedIn profiles that have been updated within the past 
month or two.
• 
LinkedIn People Finder (International) (https://cse.google.com/
cse/home?cx=009679435902400177945:psuoqnxowx8): Filter the 
results according to the following countries: United States, Canada, 
United Kingdom, Ireland, India, New Zealand, China, and Australia.
For your OSINT search work, LinkedIn is considered the first place to search for 
people who work in a particular profession to find their employment history. For 
instance, you can figure out a user’s experience by seeing their endorsement skills and 
employment history. The people who endorse the target can also become a target for 
your search to see their relationship with the main target (e.g., their work relationships, 
date when worked together, and which projects they worked on). Remember to adjust 
your account privacy settings to prevent others from knowing your identity when 
conducting searches on LinkedIn.
 General Resources for Locating Information 
on Social Media Sites
There are many online services that can be used—in accordance with the search 
techniques already discussed—to find useful information about any target who has a 
presence on one or more of the social media sites.
• 
Buzz Sumo (http://buzzsumo.com): Find the most shared topic or 
subject that is currently trending on major social media platforms.
• 
Key Hole (http://keyhole.co): This offers hashtag and keyword 
tracking across different social media sites; you can track Twitter 
accounts, mentions, and URLs.
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
254
• 
MIT PGP Public Key Server (http://pgp.mit.edu): Search on the 
PGP Public Key Server, which can reveal the target’s email address. 
You can use it to conduct further investigations if a target uploaded 
their public key to such servers.
Note! You can see a list of all pgp public key servers and check their status at 
https://sks-keyservers.net/status.
 Other Social Media Platforms
We mentioned the most popular social media sites in this chapter. However, talking about 
all social platforms that exist in the world today would require a book on its own. There are 
hundreds of active social media sites in the world, and some of them are popular within 
their own societies only (like the Chinese sites). Table 5-1 lists the other—less popular—
social media sites that must also be considered when conducting online investigations.

 Pastebin Sites
Pastebin is a text-sharing service; it allows any Internet user to post a large amount of 
text data without even registering at the Pastebin site. Although it is intended to share 
legitimate data, many black hat hackers are using it to distribute stolen data such as 
compromised social media accounts (username and passwords), private IP addresses 
and subnets belonging to various corporations around the world, and user credentials 
taken from different breached online services.

 Social Media Psychological Analysis
Social media sites have become integrated into our daily lives. People are using them 
increasingly to publish all types of digital contents online. Up until now, we have focused 
on harvesting data from social sites. However, there is a point that we should not omit 
when conducting analysis of the harvested data: the psychological status of the person 
posting the contents on their profile can also give important information, even more 
than the content itself (in some cases). For instance, the true identity of an anonymous 
Twitter account can be revealed by performing linguistic analysis of the suspect account. 
In addition, suspects can be tracked online by examining the way they use language 
when they chat or when they broadcast their thoughts online (for example, the way a 
target uses capitalization, omits or includes words , and pronounces some words). The 
advances in artificial intelligence systems will make analyzing social media accounts 
more effective and will help investigators uncover the true identity of anonymous social 
media accounts.
Note! analyzing online content—especially content found on social media 
platforms—becomes important to the forensic context of crime investigation, 
oSint intelligence, cyber-exploits, trials, and judicial procedures. this science is 
known as forensic linguistics.

Analyzing the target’s psychological status of their online content is outside this 
book’s scope. However, there are some online services that can aid you to analyze online 
contents and predict the psychological status of the target upon posting it.
 Tone Analyzer
This online service (https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net) offers free linguistic 
analysis to detect human feelings—such as joy, fear, sadness, anger, analytical, confident, 
and tentative tones—found in text such as tweets, emails, and Facebook messages  
(see Figure 5-35).
 Watson Tone Analyzer
This (https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/) is a cloud-based 
server created by IBM. It analyzes emotions and tones in online content (e.g., Facebook 
posts, reviews, and tweets) to predict the emotional status of the writer. This service can 
be used in different scenarios—other than intelligence—such as understand customer 
needs to better serve them.

 Facebook and Twitter Prediction
This site (https://applymagicsauce.com/demo.html) predicts your psycho- 
demographic profile. The service can analyze your Facebook and Twitter posts and give 
insight about your personality, which is useful to see what your current social profile says 
about you or about any target. You can also insert any text in the website to predict the 
psycho-demographic profile of its author.
 Fake Sport
This site (https://www.fakespot.com) analyzes Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Apple 
App store user reviews to check the credibility of them.
 Review Meta
With this site (https://reviewmeta.com) you can investigate user reviews on Amazon to 
check which one is likely to be fake or misleading.
 TweetGenie
This (www.tweetgenie.nl/index.php) is a Dutch project that predicts the target’s age 
and gender from a Twitter username.
 Summary
In this chapter, we covered the most popular social media sites worldwide, focusing on 
the one with the highest number of monthly active visitors. In today’s digital age, it is 
rare to see an Internet user who does not have at least one account on one or more social 
media site. People use social media services to post all types of contents online such as 
photos, videos, text messages, and geolocation data. They also mention their education, 
employment history, and the addresses where they live. Personal information such as 
social connections, places visited, habits, likes and dislikes, family members, spouse, 
and more can all be found easily. Although social networking sites allow their users to 
tighten their privacy controls to prevent others from seeing posted content, few people 
care about such issues and post many of their activities—especially text posts and  
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
259
check- ins—in public status. This makes a large volume of accessible data readily 
available to different kinds of online investigations.
This chapter explained how to search popular social media sites to locate 
information beyond the typical search functionality offered by each service. In the next 
chapter, we will continue the discussion of how to locate information about people 
online by focusing on a specific type of search engines known as people search engines. 
These engine are similar to typical search engines. However, they index content related 
to individuals only. The next chapter will also cover government records (also known 
as public records). These are confidential records produced by local governments, and 
they contain valuable information about specific country citizens. By combining the 
information from people search engines and government records with the information 
harvested from social media sites, you can—almost—find all the information available 
about a specific person online.

CHAPTER 6
People Search Engines 
and Public Records
In today’s digital age, most people have some kind of online presence, either directly or 
indirectly. Other entities—such as government and local authorities—also store some 
type of information about their citizens in publicly accessible databases. Searching for 
someone is not always as easy as typing their name into Google or Facebook; people 
with a small online presence will not appear easily when searching for them online. 
In the previous chapter, we demonstrated the importance of social media sites to find 
people online. In this chapter, we will continue our discussion of how to find people 
online using specialized websites known as people search engines in addition to looking 
up people in government records (also known as public records).
Covering these topics in one chapter is convenient because when you search for 
people online, a considerable amount of information is derived from public databases.
In this chapter, we will list the main people search engines currently available 
(focusing on the free services) and talk briefly about the distinct features offered by 
each one. We will also cover government record sites and categorize them according to 
the information offered. The information in this chapter combined with the previous 
chapter will help you find information about most targets online.
 What Is a People Search Engine?
People search engines are similar to typical search engines; people search engines 
index online content but focus on people’s personal details and store the results in huge 
databases to return information upon request. Different parameters are used to search 
for people on these sites such as target e-mail address, phone number, social username, 
and full name. Some websites offer additional search parameters such as relative 
262
names, mailing address, date of birth, known aliases, ages, and even photographs
