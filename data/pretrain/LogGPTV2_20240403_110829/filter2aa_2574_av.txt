### Using Boolean Operators in LinkedIn Searches

- **NOT Operator:** Use the NOT operator to exclude a particular term. For example, `developer NOT designer` will search for profiles that include "developer" but exclude "designer."
- **OR Operator:** Use the OR operator to include one or more terms together. For example, `developer OR designer` will search for profiles that include either "developer," "designer," or both.
- **AND Operator:** Use the AND operator to include two or more terms together. For example, `developer AND designer` will search for profiles that include both "developer" and "designer." Note that you don't need to use the AND operator explicitly; LinkedIn automatically adds it when you enter multiple terms with a space between them.
- **Parentheses:** Use parentheses to combine search terms. For example, `penetration tester NOT (developer OR designer)` will search for a penetration tester and exclude profiles that include either "developer" or "designer."

### Leveraging Google to Search within LinkedIn

You can use Google to search within LinkedIn by using the `site:` operator. For example, `"Nihad Hassan" site:linkedin.com` will search for the profile of Nihad Hassan on LinkedIn.

#### Google Custom Searches for LinkedIn

Google custom search engines can be useful for retrieving specific results from LinkedIn. Here are some examples:

- **Recently Updated Profiles:** [Link](https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=009462381166450434430:luit7gbqx2a) - Retrieves recently updated LinkedIn profiles.
- **LinkedIn Contact Extractor:** [Link](https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=001394533911082033616:tm5y1wqwmme) - Extracts LinkedIn profiles with publicly accessible contact information, including email addresses.
- **LinkedIn Résumés:** [Link](https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=010561883190743916877:qa_v6ioerxo#gsc.tab=0) - Searches for updated LinkedIn profiles within the past month or two.
- **LinkedIn People Finder (International):** [Link](https://cse.google.com/cse/home?cx=009679435902400177945:psuoqnxowx8) - Filters results by country, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, India, New Zealand, China, and Australia.

### LinkedIn as a Primary OSINT Source

LinkedIn is a valuable resource for gathering information about professionals. You can find employment history, skills, and endorsements. Additionally, examining the relationships and endorsements of a target's connections can provide insights into their work relationships, collaboration dates, and project involvement. Ensure your account privacy settings are adjusted to maintain anonymity during your searches.

### General Resources for Locating Information on Social Media

Several online services can help you find useful information about targets with a social media presence:

- **BuzzSumo (http://buzzsumo.com):** Identifies trending topics and subjects across major social media platforms.
- **Keyhole (http://keyhole.co):** Tracks hashtags and keywords across various social media sites, including Twitter accounts, mentions, and URLs.
- **MIT PGP Public Key Server (http://pgp.mit.edu):** Searches for public keys, which may reveal email addresses. Useful for further investigations if the target has uploaded their public key.

### Other Social Media Platforms

While we have covered popular social media sites, there are many other platforms, especially those popular in specific regions. Table 5-1 lists less popular social media sites that should be considered for online investigations.

### Chapter 6: People Search Engines and Public Records

In today's digital age, most individuals have an online presence, either directly or indirectly. Government and local authorities also store information about citizens in publicly accessible databases. Searching for someone online is not always straightforward, especially for those with minimal online activity. In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of social media for finding people online. This chapter will explore specialized websites known as people search engines and government records (public records).

#### What Is a People Search Engine?

People search engines are similar to typical search engines but focus on indexing personal details. These engines allow you to search for people using parameters such as email address, phone number, social username, and full name. Some sites offer additional search parameters like relative names, mailing address, date of birth, known aliases, ages, and even photographs.
