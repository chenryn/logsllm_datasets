Abstract. With respect to power consumption, cryptocurrencies have
been discussed in a twofold way: First, the cost-beneﬁt ratio of mining
hardware in order to gain revenue from mining that exceeds investment
and electricity costs. Second, the overall electric energy consumption of
cryptocurrencies to estimate the environmental eﬀects of Proof-of-Work.
In this paper, we consider a complementary aspect: The stability of the
power grids themselves. Power grids have to continuously maintain an
equilibrium between power supply and consumption; extended periods
of imbalance cause signiﬁcant deviation of the utility frequency from
its nominal value and destabilize the power grid, eventually leading to
large-scale blackouts. Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies are potential can-
didates for creating such imbalances as disturbances in mining can cause
abrupt changes in power demand. The problem is ampliﬁed by the ongo-
ing centralization of mining hardware in large mining pools. Therefore,
we investigate power consumption characteristics of miners, consult min-
ing pool data, and analyze the amount of total power consumption as
well as its worldwide distribution of two major cryptocurrencies, namely
Bitcoin and Ethereum. Thus, answering the question: Are Proof-of-Work
based cryptocurrencies a threat to reliable power grid operation?.
1 Introduction
Power grids must continuously keep an equilibrium between power consumption
and supply. Power plant operators therefore have to follow the consumer demand,
and adjust their supply in accordance. They rely on sophisticated prediction
models, and the remaining gap between supply and consumption is closed by
control reserve, i.e., power plants in standby. Whereas, a continuous imbalance
in the power grid leads to the utility frequency drifting away from its nomi-
nal set point of 50 Hz or 60 Hz (depending on the country). If supply exceeds
consumption, the frequency of the power grid increases; if supply fails to fulﬁll

consumption, the frequency decreases. The system frequency is indeed an indi-
cator of the power grid’s state, and small ﬂuctuations – a few hundred mH –
around the nominal value are normal. However, larger deviations – more than
0.5 Hz—trigger automatic emergency routines such as load shedding or power
plant shutdowns. The operators’ course of action relies on the assumption that
power consumers behave independently of each other, and do not perform con-
certed actions. Recent work [7] has shown that coordinated control over devices
is in fact able to cause load shedding, and large scale blackouts. Therein, the
authors assume a botnet that allows an adversary to remotely and simultane-
ously increase the bots’ power consumption. As electronic devices are orders of
magnitude faster in modulating their power consumption than control reserve
can be activated, the power grid frequency drifts away from its nominal value,
ﬁnally triggering emergency routines. In addition to reaction speed, the total
amount of control reserve, i.e., power plants, in standby is limited.
Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum draw
substantial amounts of electric power as a consequence of their underlying con-
sensus mechanism, referred to as Nakamoto consensus [5]. In principle, partici-
pation in this process is possible for anyone and is governed by economic factors,
as prospective miners analyze the cost-beneﬁt ratio of acquiring and providing
computational resources to the network in exchange for cryptocurrency units1.
Up until now, this fact has been discussed primarily in the context of sustain-
ability and the potential ecological impact large scale cryptocurrency mining
could entail [15,23,32]. Some estimates rank Bitcoin’s overall electricity con-
sumption comparable to that of medium-sized national states with the potential
to grow even further in the future. In this paper, we discuss a complementary, yet
unconsidered aspect of cryptocurrencies and power consumption. Speciﬁcally, we
investigate whether PoW cryptocurrencies could represent a threat to reliable
power grid operation that is comparable to the botnet described above. A closer
look emphasizes that cryptocurrencies indeed have the potential to be harmful
to reliable power grid operation for the following reasons:
– Hardware that is mining a particular cryptocurrency uses the same, or very
similarly behaving, software on all nodes. Thus, their power consumption may
not be independent of each other and therefore violating the grid operators’
assumptions. A single disturbance in the software – may it be a consequence
of an occasional error or a malicious action – impacts a large amount of miners
at once. For example, a high number of all Ethereum nodes experienced an
outage due to a software bug in September 20162. If such an event impacts
the nodes’ power consumption, even minor changes add up to large overall
power lifts for the power grid. For example, a Linux leap second bug caused
an overall power increase by 1 MW in a single data centre in 20123.

– Cryptocurrency nodes are electronic devices, and are thus able to modulate
their power consumption in a fast way – typically below 100 ms – which is a
few orders of magnitude faster than the reaction speed of the power grid.
– Miners – at least when operating in the same mining pool – share a communi-
cation infrastructure to coordinate their eﬀorts. An error in this communica-
tion structure or its compromise by an adversary could allow for botnet-style
control including manipulation of the participants’ power consumption.
– Miners have vast computing power, and therefore draw high amounts of power
from the grid. As long as it remains proﬁtable their operators are economically
motivated to bring more and more mining hardware into the cryptocurrency
network, leading to increased power consumption at high growth rates – with-
out actually improving capacity for the cryptocurrency. Beyond, this growth
has been fueled by an ongoing cryptocurrency hype.
Summarizing, cryptocurrencies show potential to become troublemakers for
power grids and their reliable operation. In addition to the overall power con-
sumption, the miners’ development over time and their geographical spread are
of interest for an in-depth analysis. The paper at hand aims to contribute this
missing information in order to shed light onto the issue whether cryptocurren-
cies are a threat to reliable power grid operation. In particular, we answer the
following questions:
– How does power consumption of diﬀerent cryptocurrencies and their mining
pools behave over time? Further, how is power consumption geographically
spread?
– Which scenarios, e.g., outage of a large number of miners, show potential to
impact power grid reliability and which prerequisites have to be met for such
an event to aﬀect the power grid?
– Has power consumption of cryptocurrencies already surpassed the threshold
of being critical for reliable power grid operation? Respectively, when does
power consumption reach this critical threshold considering past growth of
cryptocurrencies and their increased mining eﬃciency?
Due to the large number of available cryptocurrencies, we limit ourselves to
the two currently most popular PoW cryptocurrencies by market capitalization
and transaction volume, namely Bitcoin [21] and Ethereum [6]. With respect to
the power grid, we investigate the impact on European power grids, among them
the Synchronous Grid of Continental Europe (formerly UCTE grid) which is the
largest power grid by total consumption. Beyond, European grids are considered
to be among the most reliable networks.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides a back-
ground on power grid operation and cryptocurrencies; Sect. 3 presents our threat
scenario. Section 4 assesses power consumption models with respect to the qual-
ity of results. Then, Sect. 5 investigates cryptocurrencies’ current power con-
sumption for mining, while Sect. 6 investigates the geographic spread of miners
by investigating the largest Ethereum mining pool as well as including publicly

available information for Bitcoin. Section 7 analyzes cryptocurrencies’ impact on
the power grid. Section 8 discusses our results, Sect. 9 presents related work, and
Sect. 10 concludes.
2 Background
First, this section provides an overview on power grid operation before describing
the technology behind cryptocurrencies.
Power Grids in Europe: Power grids have expanded from islands, e.g., a
city, to national grids and ﬁnally international ones for reasons of higher reli-
ability, as an outage of a single power plant is easier to handle by numerous
other plants compensating for the loss. These grids are operated synchronously,
i.e., the net sine is of the same frequency at the same angle; otherwise, short
circuits would cause harm to the equipment. As electric power cannot be stored
at large quantities, grid operators have to keep a balance between consumption
and supply at all times. This is achieved in two steps: First, operators estimate
power consumptions by means of load proﬁles. These are sophisticated models
forcasting the consumption in dependence of time of the year, weekday, weather
forecast and many more parameters. Second, fast power plants are run in stand-
by mode to close the remaining gap between consumption and supply. This gap
is measured by the network’s frequency deviation from its nominal value (50 Hz
in European networks). If consumption exceeds supply, turbines of power plants
slow down leading to a lower frequency. If supply is higher than consumption,
turbines accelerate and this increases frequency as well. Bearing in mind that
fast-reacting power plants are still relatively slow in comparison to IT equip-
ment [7]. While the latter are able to modulate their consumption within a range
of multiple tens of milliseconds to seconds, gas turbines need tens of second for
activation. Primary control, the fastest countermeasure reacting to imbalances,
in the UCTE network is required to be fully activated within 30 s [11]. Sec-
ondary and tertiary control take even longer. Power operators aim to keep the
frequency within a band around the nominal value, typically a few hundreds of
mHz. Large deviations cause emergency routines [31]: (49.8 Hz) Alerting, Shed-
ding of pumps, (49.0 Hz) load shedding of 10–15% of total load, (48.7 Hz) load
shedding of additional 10–15%, (48.4 Hz) load shedding of further 15–25% of
load. At frequencies below 47.5 Hz and above 51.5 Hz all power plants are dis-
connected from the power grid in order to protect mechanical equipment like
turbines and generators.
Cryptocurrency Mining: The cryptographic currency Bitcoin was inarguably
the ﬁrst successful decentralized implementation of an electronic payment sys-
tem, as it does not have to rely on individual trusted parties to prevent the
double spending problem [22]. To achieve resistance against Sybil attacks [9],
but nevertheless allow for dynamic membership of (consensus) participants, Bit-
coin requires some form of pricing mechanism ascribed to the creation of iden-
tities in the system. This is achieved through relying on a chained construction
188

of Proofs-of-Work, the latter of which traces its origins back to the works of
Dwork and Naor [10] and Back [3]. In Bitcoin, miners 4 attempt to solve a
cryptographic puzzle, namely a partial pre-image attack on the SHA-256 cryp-
tographic hash function. As part of its input it takes a previous puzzle solution
as well as a Merkle tree root of newly proposed transactions. Thereby, a cryp-
tographically linked tree of puzzle solutions is formed, of which only the longest
consecutive chain with the most cumulative diﬃculty of puzzles is considered
to be the current valid state by honest participants. Under the assumption that
the majority of computational power is controlled by honest participants, and
that they will only append new solutions to the head of a valid (block)chain, it
becomes exponentially diﬃcult for an adversary to alter previous states by pre-
senting a new, longer chain that is considered valid. This mechanism of reaching
eventual agreement on a common preﬁx of chained puzzle solutions is referred
to as Nakamoto consensus. The principles behind Nakamoto consensus form
the basis for all decentralized PoW cryptocurrencies. Nakamoto consensus also
relies on game theoretic incentives, whereby operators of mining hardware are
rewarded in cryptocurrency units if their puzzle solution eventually ends up as
part of the agreed upon valid blockchain. The operators can expect, on average,
to successfully mine blocks that end up on the blockchain proportional to the
amount of computational power they hold in relation to that of all participants
Because mining is a random process with large variance, operators often form
their mining hardware together in mining pools to beneﬁt from more predictable
payouts [17,28]. Alternative cryptocurrencies often rely on a diﬀerent Proof-of-
Work function to Bitcoin, such as Ethash in the case of Ethereum [35]. When
we refer to hash rate within the course of this paper, we imply the number of
trials that are conducted for a given PoW function in an attempt to ﬁnd a valid
solution over a particular time frame.
3 Threat Model
Our threat scenario is depicted in Fig. 1(a). We assume an amount of miners of
the same cryptocurrency – may it be Bitcoin or Ethereum – mining the respective
cryptocurrency. Each of these miners draws a modest amount of electricity from
the power grid. However, in total, power consumption of individual miners add
up to a large volume. If all (or a large number of) miners switch from mining
to idling abruptly the total power consumption drops within seconds or less.
Figure 1(b) depicts this eﬀect from the power grid’s perspective. While power
consumption ideally would follow an inverse step function, it is likely that the
real-world behavior is slightly smoother. The surplus of energy in the grid will
lead to an increased frequency until the control reserves try to stabilize the
system. However, due to generators’ inertia, activation takes up to 30 s. If the
miners’ reduction in consumption is high enough the induced frequency shift can

of this hardware).
