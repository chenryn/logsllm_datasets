### Author Identification and Stylometry: Applications and Methodologies

#### Introduction to Stylometry and Its Applications
Stylometry, the statistical analysis of linguistic style, has evolved from its initial use in literary attribution to a wide range of forensic applications. This includes identifying authors of threatening messages, detecting multiple authorship, verifying document authenticity, and profiling authors based on characteristics such as age, gender, and native language.

#### Historical Context and Shift in Application
During the early period, the primary application of author identification shifted from literary attribution to forensic contexts. In forensics, the text to be classified is often much shorter, and the known and unknown texts may come from very different domains (e.g., academic writing versus a threatening letter). Some forensic linguists are skeptical of using online corpora for training classifiers due to concerns about the reliability of ground truth labels.

#### Diverse Goals of Stylometry
Stylometry serves various purposes beyond authorship attribution, including:
- **Multiple Authorship Testing**: Identifying whether a document was written by more than one person.
- **Authenticity Verification**: Verifying the authenticity of documents such as suicide notes, disputed wills, and other critical texts.
- **Deception Detection**: Detecting hoaxes, frauds, and deceptive content.
- **Text Genre Classification**: Classifying texts into different genres.
- **Author Profiling**: Determining an author's age, gender, and native language.

Stylometry has also been applied to non-textual domains, such as music and code, which share grammatical and linguistic features with natural language. Other forensic tasks, like identifying file types and recovering text from acoustic emanations, use similar techniques but with simpler models.

#### Interdisciplinary Nature and Critiques
The study of authorship attribution spans multiple disciplines and is not limited to stylometric techniques. For a comprehensive overview, Juola's survey [35] is highly recommended. While stylistics in literary criticism aims at authorship attribution, it is often subjective and non-quantitative. Attempts to apply it to forensic author identification have been criticized as pseudoscience [36].

#### Complementary Techniques
Plagiarism detection, which identifies common content between documents, can be seen as complementary to stylometric authorship attribution. Both aim to uncover hidden relationships in text, though plagiarism detection focuses on content rather than style.

#### Privacy and Anonymity Concerns
Little research has explored the privacy implications of stylometry. A notable study by Rao and Rohatgi [38] investigated whether individuals posting under different pseudonyms on USENET newsgroups could be linked based on their writing style. They used function words and Principal Component Analysis to cluster pseudonyms belonging to the same individual.

Koppel et al. [39, 11] conducted large-scale author identification experiments using a 10,000-author blog corpus. However, their method, which relies solely on character 4-grams, raises methodological concerns. The lack of preprocessing to remove common substrings, such as signatures, further complicates the interpretation of their results.

Nanavati et al. [40] demonstrated that stylometry can identify reviewers of research papers with high accuracy, given access to a large number of unblinded reviews. Other researchers have explored manual and semi-automated techniques to resist stylometric identification [16, 17], though the resilience of these methods to tailored attacks remains an open question.

#### Technological Developments and Deanonymization
Recent technological advancements, such as browser fingerprinting and history stealing, have made it easier to track and identify users across the web. These deanonymization techniques complement stylometric approaches, providing additional tools for adversaries.

### Experimental Methodology and Attack Model

#### Simulating Real-World Attacks
Our experimental design simulates an adversary attempting to identify the author of an anonymously published blog. We assume the author does not attempt to hide their writing style, either due to lack of awareness or lack of tools. By comparing the anonymous blog posts with a corpus of samples from other blogs, the adversary aims to find a second, more easily identified blog by the same author.

#### Feature Extraction and Classification
We use a variety of linguistic features for classification, including:
- **Length**: Number of words/characters in a post.
- **Vocabulary Richness**: Yule’s K and frequency of hapax legomena, dis legomena, etc.
- **Word Shape**: Frequency of words with different combinations of upper and lower case letters.
- **Word Length**: Frequency of words with 1–20 characters.
- **Letters, Digits, Punctuation, Special Characters**: Frequencies of specific characters and symbols.
- **Function Words**: Frequency of common words like 'the', 'of', and 'then'.
- **Syntactic Category Pairs**: Frequency of every pair (A, B), where A is the parent of B in the parse tree.

#### Experimental Design
To conduct our experiments, we simulate the case of an individual publishing two blogs by dividing the posts of a single blog into two groups. We then measure our ability to match the two groups of posts back together. Specifically, we select a blog, set aside several posts for testing, and train a classifier to recognize the writing style of each blog in the dataset, excluding the test posts. After training, we present the test posts to the classifier and rank all blogs according to their likelihood of producing the test posts. Our results show surprisingly high levels of identifiability, with the correct blog often ranked first out of 100,000 in 20% of trials.

#### Challenges and Future Work
Despite the promising results, there are valid methodological concerns. Ensuring that any detected linking is unintentional and addressing the challenges of assembling a large, labeled dataset remain key areas for future research. Additionally, the resilience of obfuscation techniques to tailored attacks needs further investigation.

By addressing these challenges, we aim to provide a more robust and reliable framework for stylometric authorship attribution and deanonymization.
