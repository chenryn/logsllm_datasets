## Abstract
Top domain rankings (e.g., Alexa) are frequently used in security research to survey security features or vulnerabilities of "relevant" websites. The choice and use of such domain rankings can significantly influence research outcomes. This paper quantifies various characteristics of three top domain lists, including the "weekend effect" in Alexa and Umbrella, which causes these rankings to change their geographical diversity between the workweek and the weekend. Additionally, up to 91% of ranked domains appear in alphabetically sorted clusters containing up to 87k domains of presumably equivalent popularity. We discuss the practical implications of these findings and propose novel best practices for the use of top domain lists in the security community.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, Internet measurements have become a subdiscipline within security research, aiming to quantify the prevalence of security risks and vulnerabilities. Since many security assessments do not scale to the entire Internet, researchers often focus on a subset of registered domains, typically the most popular ones. These "top site" rankings, such as those provided by Alexa, Majestic, Quantcast, and Umbrella, play a central role in determining the sample of domains to be studied.

Alexa's list, in particular, is widely used in security and Internet measurement conferences. However, several studies have noted its limitations, such as the lack of reliability in lower ranks and the presence of malicious domains. Researchers have devised ad-hoc mitigations, such as using only a list prefix, multiple domain lists, or domains that have been present on the list for a longer period. Despite these efforts, systematic investigations into the nature of these lists are still emerging.

Scheitle et al. [30] and Le Pochat et al. [20] conducted rigorous analyses of top domain lists, examining their construction, data sources, and resilience to manipulation. While these studies provided valuable insights, certain aspects, such as the "weekend effect" and clustering, have received less attention.

In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the weekend effect, showing that it affects the content categories and geographical diversity of listed domains. We also quantify and explain the presence of alphabetically sorted clusters of domains in Alexa and Umbrella, which can reach up to 87k domains. Our findings highlight the need for more robust and stable domain selection processes. We distill our results into concrete recommendations for the use of top domain lists in security research.

- **Weekend Changes:** Detailed analysis of weekend changes in Alexa and Umbrella, including their impact on content categories and geographical diversity.
- **Clustering:** First to quantify and explain the presence of alphabetically sorted clusters of domains in Alexa and Umbrella.
- **Best Practices:** Propose novel best practices to minimize unwanted biases in security research using top domain lists.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Use of Top Lists in Security Research
Top domain lists, such as Alexa Top Sites, are frequently used in security research to select a representative sample of domains for analysis. Le Pochat et al. [20] found 102 papers using the Alexa ranking at major security conferences from 2015 to 2017/2018, and Scheitle et al. [30] identified 68 studies using Alexa at top measurement, security, and systems conferences in 2017.

Researchers use these lists in different ways, such as computing aggregates over the domains or obtaining samples of "benign" domains for training models or evaluating security systems. The reliability and stability of these lists are critical for accurate research outcomes.

### 2.2 List Compilation Methodology
We consider four major top site lists: Amazon Alexa Top Sites, The Majestic Million, Quantcast Top Websites, and Cisco Umbrella Top 1 Million. Table 1 summarizes the data sources and popularity models of each ranking.

- **Alexa:** Data comes from users with the Alexa toolbar, who share their browsing history. Domains are ranked based on the number of visitors and unique URLs visited. Ranks below 100k are not statistically meaningful.
- **Majestic:** Based on a continuously updated web crawl, domains are ranked by the number of unique /24 IP networks hosting inbound links.
- **Quantcast:** Ranks are based on direct traffic measurements through client-side tracking code and estimated traffic for non-customer websites. Some entries are hidden, making it challenging to compare with other lists.
- **Umbrella:** Derived from DNS lookups in Cisco’s global network, ranks are based on the unique client IPs looking up a domain.

### 2.3 Related Work
Lo and Sharma Sedhain [25] compared the available lists in 2006, but only included Alexa. Scheitle et al. [30,31] and Le Pochat et al. [20] have since provided more comprehensive analyses, focusing on the differences, evolution, and potential manipulation of these lists. While they mentioned the weekend effect and clustering, our work provides a more detailed analysis of these phenomena and their implications.

## 3. List Analysis

### 3.1 List Stability
We analyze the stability of the top 1 million rankings of Alexa, Majestic, and Umbrella by downloading the respective ranking files daily and labeling the data with the date one day prior to downloading. We divide each ranking into non-overlapping intervals of exponentially increasing length (1–10, 11–100, etc.) and calculate set intersections to allow for reordering or minor rank changes.

**Findings:**
- **Heatmaps:** The heatmaps show that the top-ranked domains exhibit less change than the lower intervals. Alexa's higher ranks are more stable than Umbrella's, where changes occur even within the top 10 domains. The bottom 900k domains are less stable in Alexa than in Umbrella.
- **Weekend Effect:** The weekend effect, described by Scheitle et al. [30], is confirmed in our heatmaps, showing transient changes that revert after the weekend. This effect is stronger in Umbrella, while Alexa shows stronger long-term drift.

**Implications:**
- **Content Categories and Geographical Diversity:** The weekend effect affects the content categories and geographical representation of the listed domains, highlighting the need for more robust and stable domain selection processes.
- **Clustering:** The presence of large, alphabetically sorted clusters of domains in Alexa and Umbrella can cause anomalies when correlating a domain's rank with measured properties.

## 4. Recommendations
Based on our findings, we propose the following best practices for the use of top domain lists in security research:

- **Consider Multiple Lists:** Use multiple top domain lists to mitigate the biases introduced by any single list.
- **Account for Clustering:** Be aware of the clustering phenomenon and adjust your analysis to account for it, especially when correlating a domain's rank with other properties.
- **Monitor Long-Term Drift:** Regularly monitor the long-term stability of the lists and adjust your sample accordingly.
- **Avoid Weekends:** When possible, avoid using lists generated during weekends to minimize the impact of the weekend effect.
- **Use Stable Intervals:** Focus on the more stable intervals of the lists, particularly the top-ranked domains, for more reliable results.

By following these recommendations, researchers can improve the robustness and accuracy of their security studies.
