The user bids a unique bid (9.99), self burning its 4th bid
(9.96).
The BPA knows Q(t + 1) and the ids in Q(t), so it sees

This state translates to the two strings ’777’,’777’, which
are given to the edit-distance calculation. The result is
’equal’ edit code, triggering the copy operation from Q(t +
1) to Q(t), which in turn produces an erroneous decision:
Q(t) ≡ Q(t + 1).
Output: Q(t)

This state is can be immediately ruled out, as Q(t) must
remain sorted throughout the auction. The BPA backtracks
and tries the second distance option, resulting in the correct
result. A simpliﬁed version of the BPA can be found in
appendix A.
The self-burn implicit edit-operation cases can be
amended by introducing a dummy phase between Q(t) and
Q(t + 1). With this dummy phase, the BPA produces a cor-
rect output:

Scenarios which are harder to catch and may break the
BPA include multiple deletions and insertions in a single
sample, which result in an identical Q(t) and Q(t + 1).
These cases occurred in under 15% of the sampled auctions,
so for simplicity we discarded such auctions.

tions.
3 Modeling the Observed Behavior
3.2 Observed Macro Behavior of Bid Values
3.1 Bid-Credicts Auctions
During a period of two months we collected data from
105 auctions. After discarding previously mentioned prob-
lematic cases, we successfully executed our BPA on 90 of
these. All of these auctions were for bid-credits, which
can be used in subsequent auctions instead of actual money.
Bid-credit auctions are common to many UBA sites, as they
allow the site to still make a proﬁt without having to deal
with actual commodity. At the site we sampled, the value of
the bid-credits is 300.00NIS (about 80$). We chose the bid-
credits auctions due to their relative small scale nature, with
respect to the number of participating bidders and the auc-
tion duration, as these reduce the probability of sampling
errors. At the site we sampled, the auctions usually lasted
5 hours and were attended by about 100 users. The possi-
ble auction bid values were between 0.01 and 10.00 NIS in
increments of 0.01, giving a total of 1,000 possible values.
In most of the observed UBA auctions in different sites,
each bidder is entitled a ﬁxed number of free bids. This
is probably an attempt to generate some increased attach-
ment of the bidder to the auction or to trigger a pseudo-
endowment effect, common to online auctions, as seen by
Wolf et al. [30]. The bid-credits auctions we sampled pro-
vided each bidder 2 free bids, and all further bids cost 6.00
NIS each. As we shall see in the results below, the 2 free
bids had a noticeable effect on the auction behavior.
Prior to analyzing individual bidders’ behaviors, we con-
sidered the macro behavior of the all the bidders as a group.
We started by plotting the qualiﬁed bid values. Figure 3
shows that the mean qualiﬁed bid value decreases linearly
with the total number of bids. As the early high bids are
disqualiﬁed, users seem to lower their bids in order to re-
place their disqualiﬁed bids with new qualiﬁed ones. Even
from this ﬁrst glance, we see that the UBA is not a random
lottery game, but a game with statistically signiﬁcant pre-
dictable behavior.
3.3 Sniping
As discussed in [23, 5, 12], bidders tend to use late bid-
ding strategies, often referred to as "sniping". In UBA we
can see a similar phenomenon. As seen in Figure 4, 18%
of the bids were placed in the last ten minutes of the auc-
tion, and 5% were placed in the last minute. This behavior
is also reﬂected in the winning chances: 61% of the win-
ners placed their bids in the last 10 minutes, 42% in the last
minute and 5% in the last 10 seconds. The signiﬁcant drop
of the win probability at the last seconds probably has to
do with the increasing congestion of bids near the auction’s
end, leading to more disqualiﬁcations than qualiﬁcations.
3.4
Individual Bidders Behaviors
Beyond the macro behavior of the bidders group as a
whole, we wanted to identify individual bidder strategies.
Figure 4. Number of bids as a function of time
for auctions with a duration of 5 hours
Figure 5. The empirical distribution of bid val-
ues made by 2-bids bidders superimposed
with a bimodal truncated normal curve
Our goal was to extract features that allow us to construct a
behavioral model we can simulate.
The ﬁrst thing we observed by extracting bidders’ bids
is that 43% of the bids are generated by only 7% of the
bidders. Each bidder of the remaining 93% only bids two
bids throughout the entire auction (see Table 2). This is not
surprising, as the bid-credits auctions we sampled provided
each bidder with 2 free bids. Novice bidders apparently re-
frained from fully indulging in the game by an actual money
investment. Thus, we deduce that there are two broad types
of bidders: “2-bids bidders” and “heavy bidders”.
3.4.1 2-Bids Bidders
Understanding the 2-bids bidding behavior is important, as
it accounts for the majority of the bids (57%). As seen in
Figure 5 the bid values of the 2-bids bidders have two dis-
tinct peaks, one near value 9.00, and the other near the max-
imal value of 10.00. This distribution is modeled well by a
bimodal normal distribution, consisting of two Gaussians of
different weights,
0.25N (µ1, σ2
1)+0.75N (µ2, σ2
2)
µ1 = 10.0, σ1 = 0.25

and
truncated
to
the
domain
The timing of the bids made by the 2-bids bidders is less
obvious and behaves quite randomly apart from a minor
peak at the beginning of the auction, see Figure 6.
With both the timing and the bids distribution in hand we
can simulate the 2-bid bidder population in the following
manner:
1. Choose two time slots in the range of the auction dura-
tion: t1, t2 uniformly at random.

population as a function of time for auctions
with a duration of 5 hours
2. Sample two values from the bimodal truncated normal
distribution: v1, v2
3. During the auction simulation, at time t1(t2) make bid
with value v1(v2)
It is interesting to see that changes in the simulation param-
eters of the 2-bids bidders signiﬁcantly change the simu-
lated macro behavior of the auctions. Figure 7 shows how
varying the µ1 parameter between 9.0 and 10.0 impacts the
overall macro behavior of all the simulated bidders (the sim-
ulation discussion is in Section 4) . The ﬁgure shows that
increasing µ1 by 0.5 produces a clear increase in the bid
mean value curve by approximately 0.2 throughout the sim-
ulation. Compare to Figure 3 where we saw the behavior
observed in real auctions.

ters of 2-bids bidders and heavy-bidders

leading bid. The X indicates disqualiﬁcation of a previously
qualiﬁed bid. Between times 16800-17200 we can see that
the bidder attempted to ﬁnd the leading bid using the clos-
est position private signals. Roughly at 17100 he found an
empty slot above the leader and became the current leader.
Immediately after, some additional attempts were made to
ﬁnd additional qualiﬁed bids, or perhaps to disqualify the
next high position bidders. About 5 minutes later, his quali-
ﬁed bid was disqualiﬁed, and the user, left with no qualiﬁed
bids, made some more attempts. These resulted in a couple
of qualiﬁed bids, which did not last until the auction’s end.
Looking at similar graphs for other heavy bidders, such
as those depicted in Figure 8, we arrive at several character-
izations of heavy bidder’s behavior:
1. Signals are an important part of the bidding process.
2. Heavy bidders tend to keep bidding until at least a sin-
gle qualiﬁcation.
3. Bidding is performed in bursts, which can be triggered
by various causes, e.g. a disqualiﬁcation of an bid.
4. Linear searches are more common than the more efﬁ-
cient binary searches. This may be due to difﬁculties in
manually keeping track of the proposed bids, in addi-
tion to a changing bidding environment. For example,
in Figure 8(a) at time 16900 bids between 9.75-9.80
were below the leading qualiﬁed bid, but already at
time 17100, they were higher.

ent truncated-normal distributions modeling
the 2-bids bidders
3.4.2 Heavy Bidders
We consider bidders with more than 2 bids to be “heavy”.
This population is more interesting than the 2-bid bidders
for a number of reasons:
1. By placing the third bid, the bidder has started paying
for each bid. In most cases we observed, this usually
means the bidder is more involved in the auction and
will probably place additional bids in order to main-
tain a reasonable chance of winning. We observed an
average of 8.5 heavy bidders per auction (7% of all the
bidders), each placing an average of 19.72 bids.
2. Bidders that make numerous bids usually follow a
non-simplistic strategy. Thus, tracking their behaviors
helps us get more insights into actual bidding behav-
iors.
3. The winning chances of the heavy bidders population
dramatically exceed those of the 2-bid population, as
seen in Table 2. However, their expected payoff may
be negative, whereas the 2-bidders always experience
a non-negative payoff.
Extracting the different strategies calls for a ﬁner analysis
of per-bidder behavior. In our extracted auctions data, we
can closely follow each bidder’s decisions together with the
context of the current auction state, as reﬂected to the bid-
der. As an example, in Figure 8(a) we track the actions of
an individual bidder during the last 20 minutes of an auc-
tion. Down-point triangles correspond to disqualiﬁed bids
which were lower than the leading qualiﬁed bid at the cur-
rent auction state. Up-pointing triangles correspond to dis-
qualiﬁed bids above the leading bid. Filled circles corre-
spond to qualiﬁed bids, and an empty circle to a qualiﬁed
In all the graphs in Figure 8 we can see examples of bursty
bidding, which seems common to most heavy bidders be-
haviors we observed. We deﬁne a burst as a series of bids
made in rapid succession: no 2 bids more than 30 seconds
apart. With this deﬁnition we can partition the heavy-bidder
population by the number of bursts observed throughout the
auctions. Figure 9 shows a histogram of the observed num-
ber of bursts. In this ﬁgure, we can see that the mode of
the distribution corresponds to users that exhibit 2 bursts,
but some users have as many as 10 separate bursts. Fig-
ures 10 and 11 show the timings of the bursts and the me-
Figure 9. Observed frequencies of the number

Figure 8. Heavy bidders behavior of three dif-
ferent bidders during three different auctions
dian targeted position4 of each burst for the 2-bursts and
4-bursts populations respectively. Median position was pre-
ferred over the mean as no ordering was kept for disquali-
ﬁed bids above the ﬁrst position. Both 2-bursts and 4-bursts
populations show similar attributes towards the ﬁnal burst
as bidders try to reach the ﬁrst position. The number of bids
placed in each burst shows a different behavior towards the
auction’s end as well. As seen in Figure 12, this number
increases in the ﬁnal minutes, which can be the result of
sniping or bidding wars.
3.4.4 Payoff
Table 2 shows that heavy bidders have much better chances
at winning the auctions, but says nothing about the payoff.
Obviously a bidder that loses the auction has a negative pay-
off. However, even the winner may suffer a negative payoff
if the total amount of spent bid fees surpasses the actual
value of the product. As noted by [7], bidders tend to over-
pay in standard auctions, but keeping in mind that losers still

currently leading bid.

tion of time, for 2-bursts heavy bidders. The

pay their bidding fees, bidders may minimize their losses
if they still win the auction. In Figure 13 we can see the
mean proﬁt of a single heavy bidder as a function of the
total number of heavy bidders in an auction. We see that
as the number of heavy bidders increases, the group losses
increase and the mean proﬁt per heavy bidder drops. We
can see that whenever there are more than 4 heavy bidders
participating in an auction, a rational heavy bidder should
avoid the auction (unless the bidder uses some better strat-
egy).
4 The Simulation Study
Based on the observations we made from real auctions,
our next step was to construct a simulation model. Our
model only includes two bidding populations: the 2-bid bid-
ders and the heavy bidders. Within the heavy bidder pop-

position, max number of bids, consecutive bids delay). All
the burst parameters are sampled from normal distributions
calibrated to the observed means and standard deviations,
or from a uniform distribution (see Table 3 in Appendix C
for details).
For the simulated bidders’ burst position targeting, we
applied a simple strategy using the positional hints acquired
from preceding bidding signals (which include the actual
position of a qualiﬁed bid, and the closest unique bid po-
sition to a disqualiﬁed one). This was accomplished using
weighted linear regression on the set of acquired positional
signals. The regression returns a linear estimate of the bid
value as a function of a qualiﬁed bid position. For example,
if upon bidding 9.80 a simulated bidder received a signal
notifying that the bid is unique and in the third position,
and another attempt at 9.90 returned a signal notifying of
disqualiﬁcation with the closest unique bid being at ﬁrst po-
sition, the linear model will return an estimate of 9.85 when
queried for the second position bid value. We assign heavier
weights to more recent signals, as these hold a more accu-
rate description of the current auction state. Linear regres-
sion parameters were analytically computed using a least-
square form and the weights were statistically interpreted
as inverse errors.
The simulation code was written in standard Python with
the use of Numpy [2] and Scipy [4] modules for the dis-
tribution and statistical computations and pymodelﬁt[3] for
weighted linear regression.
4.2 Model Validation
To validate our agent-based model, we tested replicative
validity (see Zeigler et al. [31]) by comparing our model
to data already acquired in real-auctions (retrodiction). We

ulation we vary the number of bursts and bid distribution.
Our model is still much simpler than real human strategies,
but as we shall see it does match the macro behavior of real
auctions very well. The model allows us to extrapolate our
ﬁndings to scenarios that we did not measure, and to test
possible automated bidding strategies.
4.1 Simulation Parameters
For easy comparison of the simulation results and the
observed behavior, we calibrated the simulation parameters
with the sampled auctions’ settings: potential bid values are
0.01,...,10.00 in increments of 0.01, each bidder gets 2 free
bids, additional bids cost 6 each, and the auction duration is
5 hours. Based on our observations, we chose to model the
heavy bidders as either 2-burst or 4-burst bidders, with each
burst following a parameter vector of: (start time, targeted

tion of the total number of bids, comparing

were looking for statistically signiﬁcant results which show
correlation between the macroscopic behavior of the real
and simulated systems.
In Figures 14 and 15 we revisit
previous real-auction data and compare it with our simu-
lation results. In ﬁgure 15 we see in the solid line with 95%
conﬁdence intervals the mean qualiﬁed bid values of real
auctions, copied from Figure 3. The dashed line represents
the mean qualiﬁed bid value, averaged over 135 simulation
runs. Since the simulated curve is within the conﬁdence in-
tervals, we can conclude that the simulation is statistically
indistinguishable from the real auctions. Figure 15 revisits
the heavy bidders proﬁtability, showing that the simulation
is valid also in the more detailed behavioral aspects, as we
can again see that the simulation curve is well within the
real conﬁdence intervals.
5 Automated Strategies
With the use of signals and computational power, we can
build an automatic bidding agent. Such an agent has the
following advantages over human players:
1. Bidding frequency: the interface with which the bid-
ding is performed in different UBA sites is usually very
