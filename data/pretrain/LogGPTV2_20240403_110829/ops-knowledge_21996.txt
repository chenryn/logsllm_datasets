User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why is "fhepfcelehfcepfffacacacacacacabn" a top DNS query from my devices? I recently set up NextDNS on my personal devices to further reduce the amount of tracking and ads I'm exposed to. The service comes with built-in analytics that shows a brief overview of your network activity.  

Most of the top hits are uninteresting, however there's one domain I couldn't figure out:  



What's the domain fhepfcelehfcepfffacacacacacacabn?
The seemingly random string gives roughly two pages of Google results, but none of them seem to hold any useful information.  

The log table says the entry is a DNS record of type NIMLOC, but that seems like another dead end inquiry-wise.

Assistant: That domain is an encoded form of the string "WORKGROUP". It is using a variant of hex encoding that uses the letters A-P, instead of the numbers 0-9 followed by A-F.

$ echo fhepfcelehfcepfffacacacacacacabn |
  tr a-p 0-9a-f |
  xxd -r -p |
  xxd

00000000: 574f 524b 4752 4f55 5020 2020 2020 201d  WORKGROUP      .



This appears to be a NetBIOS name, which is why it's padded with spaces to 15 ASCII characters, and then followed by a different character at the end as a suffix. The hex encoding is described in the NetBIOS-over-TCP/UDP Concepts RFC, called "first level encoding". Also, NetBIOS uses DNS record type ID 32 for its "name service" packets; that ID was later allocated to NIMLOC (ref), which explains that part of the log. However I'm not sure exactly what software on your machine is making this DNS query; if you're using Windows, it seems likely to be something at the OS level.

I don't believe the answer from NextDNS support is correct here about the source of this particular query—it is probably not coming from Chrome.
