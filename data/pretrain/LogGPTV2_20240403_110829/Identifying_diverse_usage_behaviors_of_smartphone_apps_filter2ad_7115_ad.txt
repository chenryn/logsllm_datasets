Table 4: genres of local apps.
For ease of reference, we term geographic usage distribution of
a quantity X to be the the empirical probability distribution function
(PDF) of X by U.S. state. First, we compute the geographic usage
distribution of the unique subscribers and of the aggregate trafﬁc
volume generated by all national smartphone apps. We then use
them to compute the geographic usage of trafﬁc volume normal-
ized by the number of unique subscribers in the state. Figure 8(a)
is the PDF of the geographic usage of the aggregate trafﬁc of all
national apps together, while Figure 8(b) is the PDF of the geo-
graphic usage of the normalized trafﬁc of all national apps. As
expected, California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois are the
states that have the highest aggregate trafﬁc from the national apps
in Figure 8(a). However, after normalizing the volume to account
for the number of subscribers, the distribution looks ﬂatter in Fig-
ure 8(b). We perform the rest of our analysis (Figure 8(c-f)) on the
normalized trafﬁc, since it makes differences across states be easier
identiﬁed.

Figure 9: difference in the geographic usage of different app
genres
Figure 8(c-f) illustrates the geographic usage of some represen-
tative genres (all genres are listed in Table 2). Figure 8(a) demon-
strates the PDF of trafﬁc volume from each state of all nation-wide
apps. Lifestyle, music, news, and social networking genres have
very similar patterns of geographic usage as the aggregate trafﬁc.
As an example, we show the social networking apps in Figure 8(c),
which is is most similar to the aggregate trafﬁc in Figure 8(b). Edu-
cation apps in Figure 8(d) appear to be extremely popular in Texas;
further analysis revealed that this is because some apps produced
by universities (e.g., TAMU) generate a signiﬁcant fraction of traf-
ﬁc among the education apps. Likewise, Figure 8(f) shows that
weather apps seem to be highly used in the south-eastern U.S. This
may perhaps have happened because the time periods of our data
coincide with the peak hurricane season in those areas [9, 19] –
such variable and dangerous weather conditions may cause users
to check weather forecasts more frequently.
Next, we measure how far the geographic usage of different gen-
res are from the aggregate geographic usage of the apps. We use
the Euclidean distance to measure the distance between a pair of
geographic usage distributions. The Euclidean distance between

a pair of distributions [x1, x2,··· , xn] and [y1, y2,··· , yn] is deﬁned
(xi − yi)2. Figure 9 shows the distance between each
as
genre’s geographic usage distribution and the distribution of aggre-
gate national apps. We note that some genres, such as books and
education, are disproportionately used in some states, while others,
such as social networking apps generate trafﬁc more proportionate
to the total trafﬁc generated by that state.
The distribution of geographic usage of different apps within the
same genre may also differ. Figure 10 shows the geographic usage
distribution of a number of smartphone apps in the news genre. For
this analysis, we select the apps of a few newspapers that are well-
known across the entire U.S., and cover news relating to any part
of the world. The location of each news app in Figure 10 only re-
ﬂects where the newspaper headquarter is located. However, some
of them have a location indicated in their names (marked with 2 in
Figure 10). Although all these apps are used nation-wide, we note
that apps whose names have a location indicated seem to be dispro-
portionally preferred at those respective locations. In addition, the
Washington D.C. news app seems to be highly preferred in Wash-
ington state as well, thus suggesting users look for apps that appear
to be local to their region.
4.3.3 Travel Area of Smartphone Apps
Our ﬁnal analysis of the spatial patterns of app usage examines
whether individual users use some apps across larger geographic
areas than others, e.g., whether Internet radio apps, which users
may listen to during their commute, are used across a larger area
than books. Such an analysis can help understand what kinds of
apps need to be more robust to variations in network quality.
For this analysis, we deﬁne the travel-area as a smartphone’s
geographic coverage per individual subscriber over short time, e.g.,
6 hours. We use the number of sectors to estimate the geographic
coverage, since we do not have access to the device’s exact loca-
tions. As noted in Section 3, the number of sectors observed in
our data set is an underestimate of the actual number of sectors
that the device passes through, but our results still give an idea of
the relative travel-area of different apps. Speciﬁcally, for each app,
we compute the average number of unique sectors used by active
subscribers in each 6 hour time interval.
