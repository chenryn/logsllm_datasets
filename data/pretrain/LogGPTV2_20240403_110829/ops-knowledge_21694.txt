User: How to configure Domain Name System (Domain Name System, DNS) server in Windows Server?
Assistant: To configure the Domain Name System (DNS) server in Windows Server, you can follow the steps below: Step 1. Install the DNS server First, in the Windows Server Manager, select "Add Roles and Features", click the "Next" button, and then Check the "DNS Server" option, and then click the "Next" and "Install" buttons all the way to install. Step 2. Configure the DNS zone After the DNS server installation is complete, open the DNS manager, right-click on the "DNS" directory on the left to select the server you want to add a DNS zone to, and select "New zone" from the pop-up options. In the new zone wizard, you can choose "primary zone" or "slave zone" according to actual needs (the primary zone is generally used for local DNS server resolution, and the secondary zone is generally used for synchronizing data from other DNS servers). After creating a new master zone, you can set the zone's name, file name, storage location, and dynamic update settings. After the creation is successful, you can see the added zone in the DNS manager. Step 3. Add DNS records Select the corresponding area in the DNS manager, click the "New Record" button in the "Dynamic Update" or "Static Update" on the right, and select the corresponding DNS record type (such as A record, CNAME record etc.), fill in the corresponding host name and IP address or alias and other information. Step 4. Test DNS resolution After the DNS record is added, you can use the nslookup command to test whether the DNS resolution is normal. After entering "nslookup" in the command line, enter the domain name or IP address to be resolved as required. The above are the simple steps to configure Domain Name System (DNS) server in Windows Server, which can be used to build local domain name resolution service or Internet domain name resolution service.
