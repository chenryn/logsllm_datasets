### Traffic Diversion and DNS Management

- **Canonical Name (CNAME):** The DPS (Distributed Protection Service) controls the authoritative name server for the canonical domain. Therefore, changes can be made in a manner similar to the process described above.
- **Name Server (NS):** The DPS also manages the authoritative name server for the protected domain, allowing it to modify address records as needed.
- **On-demand Protection:** This can be either manual or automated. For example, customer-premise mitigation equipment (an in-line appliance) can send an alert to the DPS if an attack is too large to handle in-line. In such a hybrid approach, the DPS can automatically initiate on-demand protection.

### Methodology and Data Set

To study the use of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection services, we analyzed data from active DNS (Domain Name System) measurements over a period of 1.5 years, covering a large set of domain names. We used Hadoop to identify whether and how domains are protected by a DPS. The following sections detail the measurement and analysis process, along with general statistics of the resulting data set.

#### Data Set Overview

| Start Date | SLDs | DPs | Size | Source |
|------------|------|-----|------|--------|
| 2015-03    | 550  | 161.2M | 534.5G | 17.5TiB | .com, .net, .org, .nl |
| 2016-03    | 184  | 2.2M | 1.7G | 77.5GiB | Alexa Top 1M |
| Total      | 203.3M | 655.7G | 23.3TiB |

### Active DNS Measurements

In previous work, we designed and implemented a system for large-scale, active DNS measurements [12]. This system queries specific resource records (RRs) for a given list of domains, repeating these measurements daily. It queries A, AAAA, and NS records, not only for the root label (apex) but also for common labels like "www." For example, both `name.com` and `www.name.com` are queried. All fields from the answer section of the DNS response, including CNAMEs and their full expansions, are stored.

**Figure 1** provides a high-level view of our system. The starting point is a list of domain names. We primarily measure entire zones, i.e., the full list of names in a top-level domain (TLD), with updated zone files downloaded daily from registry operators. Additionally, we measure smaller lists, such as the Alexa Top 1M ranking. This paper focuses on measurement data for `.com`, `.net`, and `.org`, which together cover about 50% of the global domain namespace. We also include measurements for the country-code TLD `.nl` and domains on Alexaâ€™s Top 1M list.

### Supplementing AS Numbers

Each IP address is supplemented with an autonomous system number (ASN) based on BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) data. The origin ASN of the most-specific prefix containing an address at the time of measurement is determined using the Routeviews Prefix-to-AS mappings (pfx2as) dataset.

### Deriving DDoS Protection Service Use

We analyzed the measurement data to detect the use of DPS providers. Several providers offer DNS-based traffic diversion and, optionally, authoritative name server protection. As detailed in Section 2, various methods exist to divert network traffic to the DPS infrastructure. Our analysis reveals, on a daily basis, whether a domain uses one or more of these methods. Specifically, we detect CNAME-based redirection by checking if the CNAME expansion of a domain contains a DPS reference. Similarly, the NS record of a domain will reference a DPS if the DNS zone is managed by that DPS. Lastly, the ASN of a domain's IP address(es) can also reference a DPS.

We detect DPS references in CNAME and NS records based on the second-level domain (SLD) contained therein. For instance, Incapsula uses the SLD `incapdns.net` in CNAME records. To identify SLD and ASN references, we start with the ASNs of a DPS, find all domain names referencing these ASNs, and analyze frequently occurring SLDs in CNAME and NS records. The SLDs obtained this way help us find any ASNs we may have missed or remove ASNs that do not belong to the DPS's mitigation infrastructure.

By evaluating combinations of references, we can determine not only if a domain uses a DPS but also how it does so. For example, a domain that references a DPS by CNAME and ASN but not by NS record shows that it uses CNAME-based redirection to divert traffic to a DPS, while its DNS zone has not been delegated to the DPS.

### Always-on and On-demand Use

To analyze whether a domain uses a DPS in an always-on or on-demand manner, we track the domain's use of the DPS over the measurement duration. If a domain always references a DPS by ASN without gap days, we assume always-on use. On-demand use is assumed if a domain switches between two IP addresses, where one does not and the other does reference a DPS. In this case, CNAME, NS, and ASN (non-)references reveal how on-demand traffic diversion was effected. For example, if the ASN of an unchanged IP address references a DPS on and off, it suggests BGP-based traffic diversion.

### Data Set

Our data set includes 1.5 years of measurements for the generic TLDs (gTLDs) `.com`, `.net`, and `.org`, plus six months for the country-code TLD (ccTLD) `.nl` and the Alexa Top 1M. Table 1 details the data set. The column `#SLDs` shows the number of unique SLDs observed over the measurement period. `#DPs` indicates the number of collected data points (i.e., CNAME, A, AAAA, and NS measurements). The `size` column shows the compressed measurement data size in our cluster using Parquet columnar storage (before replication). The three gTLDs contain about 50% of the global domain namespace; on the last day of the data set, they contain a little over 152 million names.

Some providers, like Verisign, do not use CNAME redirection but instead change the IP address through delegation. Some providers, such as F5 Networks and DOSarrest, do not offer any DNS options.

### Results

#### General Overview

Using the references in Table 2, we analyzed the three main TLDs and found the number of domains using the DPS providers under consideration each day. Figure 2 shows the variation in the number of distinct SLDs over time, dominated by many "anomalous" peaks and troughs, involving millions of domains. For example, the peak on March 5, 2015, involved about 1.1 million domain names. The anomalous trend in `.com` is replicated in `.net` and `.org`, indicating that the behavior is transversal across zones. Many larger anomalies are part of on-demand behavior, discussed in more detail in Section 4.4.

**Figure 2: DPS use and zone breakdown**

Figure 3 shows, over time, the number of domains using any of the DPS's services (the top line). Some larger anomalies can be traced to Incapsula, such as the peak in March 2015 in Figure 2. Some providers show very few anomalies and contain more domains than the more anomalous providers on their "quiet" days. For example, CloudFlare versus Incapsula in March 2015, were it not for the anomalous peak.

**Figure 3: DPS use over time per provider**

In Figure 4, we show the (average) distribution of the three main TLDs over the roughly 50% of the global domain namespace they cover, as well as the distribution of DPS-using domains among these TLDs. Both distributions are remarkably similar, suggesting no correlation between a zone and subscribing to a DPS.

#### Overall Growth

For our growth analysis, we do not count anomalous peaks.
