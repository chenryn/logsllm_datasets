Question: "In the context of Android keymaster module operations with AES keys, why would the argument 'PaddingMode::NONE is suitable for all block modes including GCM, CTR, ECB, and CBC' be considered incorrect?"
 "A": "Because `PaddingMode::NONE` is only suitable for `BlockMode::GCM` and `BlockMode::CTR`, and for `BlockMode::ECB` or `BlockMode::CBC`, the padding mode may be `PaddingMode::NONE` or `PaddingMode::PKCS7`."
 "B": "Because `PaddingMode::NONE` is incompatible with all block modes and will always result in `ErrorCode::INCOMPATIBLE_PADDING_MODE`."
 "C": "Because `PaddingMode::PKCS7` is the only authorized padding mode for all AES key operations, regardless of the block mode."
 "D": "Because `PaddingMode::NONE` is required for all block modes to ensure the highest level of encryption security."
Answer: A
