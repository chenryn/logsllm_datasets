### Title: Blackhat Asia 2019: When Voice Phishing Meets Malicious Android Apps

**Abstract:**

Traditional voice phishing, or vishing, typically involves an attacker calling a victim and using social engineering techniques to commit fraud. However, as users have become more aware of these tactics, the success rate of such attacks has diminished. A new and more sophisticated method has emerged where attackers intercept calls made by victims to legitimate government agencies or financial institutions, thereby gaining the trust of the victim.

Last year, we discovered malicious Android apps designed to intercept outgoing calls. Unfortunately, the distribution server was already shut down by the time we received reports from victims, preventing us from analyzing a live sample. A few months later, we received another report, and this time, the distribution server was still active. This allowed us to examine the server's open ports and obtain the webpage source code. We then developed a real-time automated script to collect and analyze the malicious apps based on the strings in the source code.

Over the course of our investigation, we collected approximately 3,000 malicious apps from various distribution servers. The Command and Control (C&C) server addresses were hard-coded within these apps, making them easy to extract. The C&C servers were web-based, and upon further analysis, we discovered a file containing the necessary account information to access the server. This information granted us administrative privileges on both the Windows distribution server and the C&C server database. Through a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection, we obtained extensive data, including the fact that the attackers were using PPPoE to connect to the internet, which helped us pinpoint the geographical location of the server to Taiwan, China.

One of the most intriguing findings occurred when we installed a malicious app on a test phone and called a real attacker. The individual who answered the call spoke fluent Korean and requested that we call back the next morning, as it was after his working hours (Korean banking business hours are from 9 AM to 4 PM).

In this presentation, we will share our detailed findings from the past few months, providing insights into the methods and operations of this new form of voice phishing.

**Key Points:**
- **New Vishing Method:** Attackers intercept calls to trusted entities, leveraging the victim's trust.
- **Malicious App Analysis:** Development of a real-time collection script to gather and analyze malicious apps.
- **C&C Server Access:** Obtained administrative privileges on the distribution and C&C servers.
- **Geographical Tracing:** Identified the server location in Taiwan, China.
- **Real-World Interaction:** Direct communication with an attacker, revealing operational details.

This talk aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of voice phishing and the role of malicious Android apps in these attacks.
