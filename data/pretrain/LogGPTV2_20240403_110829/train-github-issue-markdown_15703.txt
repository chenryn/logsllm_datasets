I'm an **end user** and I'm new to ES and I've been immediately faced with the
problem of getting my data processed correctly.  
The problem with ES (vs. Splunk) is that data is being indexed/analyzed first,
then stored, then you can't change it. (vs. Splunk, where almost everything
happens during search time, thus you can adjust your plans).
Currently, in order to test my new mapping params, I have to (using kopf
plugin -- otherwise I'd throw ES immediately out of window for lack of
usability):
  1. Have my data ready -- either stored in some safe index or in local .json file on disk
  2. delete index / index template -- `/_plugin/kopf/#!/cluster`
  3. adjust index appropriately and create it -- `/_plugin/kopf/#!/createIndex`
  4. Use **stream2es** in order to copy index from "safe place" to the index above -- `cat mydata.json | stream2es stdin --target http://blah:9200/newidx/type1`  
OR  
`stream2es es --source http://blah:9200/safe_idx/type1 --target
http://blah:9200/newidx/type1`
  5. Run some query, see it failing/misbehaving, read docs, see that you need mapping adjustment, GO TO step #2.
Now imagine doing this 50 times, because you can't get ES behave properly with
your data....  
This is very tedious for someone who expected modern easy-to-use software.
Ideally, I want to input my new mapping, press button, and let it do the
reindex automatically.  
Of course, this would be useful for dev env only as on production, you'd sync
the mapping changes with app schema changes.
