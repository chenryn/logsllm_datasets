## Abstract
In recent months, a new generation of mobile messaging and VoIP applications for smartphones has been introduced. These services offer free calls and text messages to other subscribers, providing an Internet-based alternative to traditional communication methods managed by cellular network carriers such as SMS, MMS, and voice calls. Despite having millions of users, very little attention has been paid to the security measures (or lack thereof) implemented by these providers.

In this paper, we analyze nine popular mobile messaging and VoIP applications, focusing on their security models, particularly authentication mechanisms. We find that most of the examined applications use the user’s phone number as a unique token to identify accounts, which complicates the implementation of robust security barriers. Our experimental results show that major security flaws exist in most of the tested applications, allowing attackers to hijack accounts, spoof sender-IDs, or enumerate subscribers.

## 1. Introduction
In the past few months, several new smartphone messaging and VoIP services with a novel user authentication concept have been introduced. These next-generation communication applications aim to replace traditional text messaging (SMS) and require only the user’s phone number for registration. Unlike well-known instant messaging services, these applications do not use additional authentication mechanisms beyond the phone number. This paper focuses on the security of applications using this novel authentication concept. Services such as Skype, Facebook Chat, and Google Chat, which have been extensively researched, are out of scope due to their different authentication methods.

The common advantages of the tools we examined include simple and fast setup routines, integration with existing on-device address books, and free communication, making them attractive to potential customers. However, we find that the design of most of these messaging systems hinders their security measures, leading to issues such as the possibility of communication without proper sender authentication.

The main contribution of our paper is an evaluation of the security of mobile messaging applications with the aforementioned properties and the possibilities of abuse in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we highlight suitable security mechanisms to prevent the misuse of these systems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of related work. Section 3 outlines the basic functionalities of the examined communication services, while Section 4 introduces our threat assessment for these applications. Section 5 documents our findings and explains how the identified flaws might pose threats to users. We conclude in Section 6 and provide a brief overview of approaches for future research.

## 2. Related Work
This paper documents our findings on weak user authentication in messaging applications on smartphones. User authentication is a well-studied area in information security, with numerous protocols designed to provide secure authentication, such as Kerberos and public key cryptography with PKI.

Due to the increasing pervasiveness of smartphones, these platforms have attracted significant interest from the security community. The security features and properties of Android and iOS have been widely studied. Additionally, the security of smartphone applications has been evaluated in the past. To the best of our knowledge, no prior evaluation of the novel smartphone messaging services analyzed in this paper has been published. Recently, cloud storage services have also attracted the interest of security researchers, analyzing the implications of faulty authentication in that area. There are several applications for Android, such as RedPhone and TextSecure, that promise encrypted, secure communication.

## 3. Mobile Messaging Applications
### General Characteristics
All applications analyzed in this paper use the user’s phone number as the basis for identification. During the setup process, the software asks the user to enter the phone number of the device. Although Android can grant direct access to the user’s phone number to applications, this mechanism is currently not in use. Apple’s iOS App Store guidelines do not allow applications to access the phone number, making manual input necessary. One unintended benefit of this approach is that even devices without a phone module (e.g., a WiFi-only tablet) can be activated using the phone number of another device. It should be noted that these messaging applications use the phone number for user identification only and do not attempt to communicate over the regular mobile phone network. The main problem with this approach is that the system must verify the user’s input, as a malicious user could enter someone else’s phone number and hijack or create an account with false credentials.

All the messengers we analyzed implement measures to prevent users from impersonating others by trying to authenticate a number they do not control. However, several of these approaches display fundamental design flaws. Section 5 analyzes the shortcomings of several messengers.

### WhatsApp
The most popular application we tested, based on its widespread distribution across various smartphone platforms, is WhatsApp. It is a cross-platform messaging application available for Android, BlackBerry, iOS, and Symbian. The vendor has not released any information on its user base, but based on Android Market sales, it can be estimated to have at least a few million users. Recently, the vendor reported that over one billion messages were sent over WhatsApp in a single day. Unlike other comparable messengers, WhatsApp does not support calls via VoIP.

## 4. Evaluation
### 4.1 Methodology
For our evaluation, we selected nine popular messaging and VoIP applications for both Android and iOS. We estimated the user base of the applications by accumulating data available from the Android Market and Xyologic, a company providing download estimations for iOS applications. Table 1 provides an overview of the applications and their features. The majority of the selected smartphone messaging applications support Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls and text messages. All tested applications used the user’s phone number as the unique user ID for initial authentication, with the Short Message Service (SMS) being the preferred method to verify the user’s control over a given phone number.

We then identified five possible attack vectors exploiting the insufficient authentication methods employed in these applications. Lastly, we systematically examined the software packages for the presence of these flaws. This section describes the five common attack vectors we identified among popular smartphone messaging applications.

#### Authentication Mechanism and Account Hijacking
We analyzed the initial setup mechanisms of the applications during which a phone number is linked to a device. None of the tested applications retrieve the device’s phone number automatically; instead, they ask the user to input it manually during the setup phase. The common method to verify the entered number is sending an SMS message to the specified number containing a verification PIN that the user must enter in the application’s user interface. We analyzed the communication between the phone and the server during the initial setup and tested if an attacker could hijack accounts by passing another user’s phone number as their own.

#### Sender ID Spoofing / Message Manipulation
In the second part of our evaluation, we analyzed the communication between the phone and the server during message sending and receiving. The attack scenarios for this part involve a malicious user who wants to send a message with a spoofed sender ID. In contrast to the scenario outlined in the previous paragraph, the attacker may do this without hijacking the entire account.

The manipulation of a message during transfer is another possible threat. However, most tested applications use encryption, which mitigates this risk.
