## ðŸš€ Feature Request

Hello,

I am interested in fine-tuning the BERTAbs model on a new dataset. Could you provide a script or some guidance on how to accomplish this task? Specifically, I am unsure how to access the loss function from the `modeling_bertabs.py` file.

Thank you for your assistance.
