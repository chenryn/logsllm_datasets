Is this behavior of `np.double` desired? I'm wondering about the middle case
which I would have expected to be `array([3.])` instead of `3.0`. I assume
there is nothing special about `double` or `3` and that this is probably not a
real issue, so it can be closed soon.
    >>> np.double(np.asarray(3))
    3.0
    >>> np.double(np.asarray([3]))
    3.0
    >>> np.double(np.asarray([3, 4]))
    array([ 3.,  4.])
