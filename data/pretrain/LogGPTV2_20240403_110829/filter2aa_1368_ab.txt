### Leveraging Technology Knowledge in the Legal Community

Given the broad spectrum of technology knowledge within the legal community, it is advantageous for tech-savvy individuals involved in litigation to collaborate with their attorneys. This collaboration can help attorneys better understand and articulate the necessary requests during the discovery process.

### Comparison with Sarbanes-Oxley

Unlike the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposed new requirements directly on organizations with strict compliance deadlines, the electronic discovery amendments primarily affect organizations through the litigation process. Many companies, constrained by tight budgets, are not taking proactive steps to prepare for potential litigation. While this is their right, it is unwise and can lead to exorbitant litigation costs when disputes eventually arise.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with data preservation duties can result in severe penalties, ranging from monetary sanctions to an "adverse inference" instruction. The latter instructs the jury to assume that any withheld files or communications were detrimental to the defendant, virtually ensuring defeat.

### Attorney Responsibility and Sanctions

Judges are increasingly holding attorneys accountable for their clients' negligent acts in preparing for discovery. For example, several California attorneys faced disciplinary action after their client withheld electronic evidence. These sanctions compel attorneys to take e-discovery more seriously, but many still lack a fundamental understanding of the underlying technology. Therefore, it is crucial to educate attorneys about technology as they guide you through the legal process.

### The Electronic Discovery Process

1. **Identification**: Identify all potential sources of responsive data, including archival backups and employee home computers.
2. **Preservation**: When litigation is reasonably anticipated, organizations have a duty to preserve all relevant data.
3. **Collection**: Data can be collected manually by employees or through forensic experts who create whole disc images of machines.
4. **Review**: Attorneys (or paralegals) review the collected data to determine its responsiveness to the lawsuit, identify privileged information, and redact irrelevant or sensitive data.
5. **Production**: Exchange of responsive information between parties.
6. **Presentation**: Use of electronic evidence in proceedings such as arbitration, mediation, or trial.

### Cost Implications of Electronic Discovery

Electronic discovery is expensive due to the time required to sift through large volumes of retained data. As storage costs have decreased, companies are retaining more data, and employees are dispersing information across multiple locations. The review process is often tedious and repetitive, with current technology unable to efficiently redact passages across near-duplicate documents. Additionally, processing costs from e-discovery vendors, such as data restoration and metadata extraction, can be significant.

### Strategies to Reduce Costs

For security and IT professionals, e-discovery can drive positive changes in corporate policy:
- **Data Identification and Location**: Ensure data can be secured and examined for relevance.
- **Volume Reduction**: Lower data volumes make it easier to secure and review.
- **Centralized Storage**: Centralizing data storage can reduce storage and litigation response costs.

Organizations should document all data handling and backup policies, infrastructure diagrams, and supported applications. Working with counsel to develop a litigation response strategy and integrating it into business continuity plans can streamline the early stages of litigation. User education can also alleviate the repetitive nature of the review process, covering topics such as proper email management, avoiding unnecessary CCs, and using the delete key appropriately.

### Security Risks in Electronic Discovery

The discovery process involves giving your data to third parties, including e-discovery vendors, law firms, and opposing counsel. This poses significant security risks. Many e-discovery vendors do not prioritize security, making them attractive targets for attackers. Organizations should demand robust security measures, such as granular user access controls and 128-bit SSL connections, from their vendors.

### Conclusion

Electronic discovery is currently a source of frustration for clients and attorneys due to its complexity and costs. However, these challenges are part of the legal system's adjustment to the digital age. E-discovery has the potential to level the playing field for litigants, much like the internet has for individual expression. It is essential to work collaboratively with counsel and leverage the expertise of security specialists to navigate these challenges effectively.
