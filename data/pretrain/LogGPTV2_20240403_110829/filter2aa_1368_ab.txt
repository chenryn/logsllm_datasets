Considering the wide range of technology knowledge within the legal community, it would 
be advantageous for those who are savvy and involved in the litigation process to confer 
with their attorneys to help them understand what they should request.
Unlike Sarbanes-Oxley which placed many new requirements directly on organizations with 
a deadline for compliance, the electronic discovery amendments only affect them through 
the litigation process.  Many companies faced with tight budgets aren’t taking many steps 
to prepare in advance for litigation.  This is clearly, their right to do so.  It is, however, 
foolish and can lead to astronomical costs of litigation when it ﬁnally does occur.  
Penalties for failing to comply with a duty to preserve data range from monetary sanctions 
all the way to an “adverse inference” instruction.  In this situation, a jury is instructed that 
they can assume that any ﬁles and communications not produced were harmful to the 
defendant.  Such an instruction all but guarantees defeat for a defendant.  
Increasingly, judges are also holding attorneys themselves responsible for the negligent 
acts of their clients in preparing for discovery.  Recently a number of California attorneys 
were reported to the state bar association for discipline after it was discovered that their 
client had withheld electronic evidence from the court.  These sanctions are forcing 
attorneys to take e-discovery much more seriously, but they may still lack a fundamental 
understanding of technology leading them to focus conversations on a certain number of 
terms and topics which have been discussed at continuing legal education seminars.  
When working with attorneys, always do your best to educate them about technology as 
much as they educate you about the legal process.
The Electronic Discovery Process
• Identiﬁcation:  The stage at which an organization ﬁnds all potential sources of 
responsive data.  This can be anywhere from archival backups to employee home 
computers.
• Preservation:  When litigation is reasonably anticipated, either through service of a 
complaint or consultation with an attorney to consider litigation, an organization has an 
afﬁrmative duty to preserve any and all responsive data.
• Collection:  Data can be collected through a variety of means ranging from manual active 
data collection by employees to the use of a forensic expert to make whole disc images 
of machines.
• Review:  Attorneys (or in some cases paralegals) will sift through the collected data to 
determine whether the documents are responsive (a much broader term than relevance) 
to the lawsuit.  They will also review for potential privilege, build logs of data which is 
retained under privilege, redact irrelevant information, employee personal information and 
any other data to be kept secret under the law (such as HIPAA).
• Production:  The actual exchange of responsive information between parties.
• Presentation:  Use of electronic evidence at a tribunal such as an arbitration, mediation 
or trial.
Why Does Electronic Discovery Cost So Much?
Electronic discovery is extremely costly due to the amount of hours that it takes to sift 
through the data retained by organizations.  As storage has become inexpensive, 
companies have chosen to retain more and employees have become more likely to spread 
information throughout the organization instead of keeping it in one place.
The review process can be tedious and repetitive.  While there are methods of identifying 
duplicate documents (using MD5 or SHA1 hashing), many near duplicates remain.  Current 
technology lacks the ability to redact passages across nearly duplicate documents, 
resulting in many hours of attorneys redacting the same passages from long email threads.  
Processing costs from e-discovery vendors can also be very expensive.  Restoring data 
from backups, imaging ﬁles, metadata extraction and OCR is very processor intensive 
which forces many projects to be handled outside law ﬁrms, placing data in the hands of a 
third party.
What Can Organizations Do To Keep Costs Down?
If there is much good news in the world of electronic discovery for security and information 
technology professionals it is that e-discovery may serve as a major driver to change 
corporate policy decisions.  The parallels between law and security are clear:  
• Unless data can be identiﬁed and located it can neither be secured nor examined for 
relevance.  
• The lower the volume of information an organization holds, the easier it is to secure and 
review for responsiveness.
• By centralizing data storage, costs of storage and potential costs of litigation response 
can be decreased.
Much of the early stages of the electronic discovery process can be completed before 
litigation is contemplated.  An organization would be well served to fully document all 
policies and procedures relating to data handling and backup, infrastructure diagrams and 
supported applications.  In addition, working with inside and outside counsel to formulate 
a litigation response strategy and incorporating it with all business continuity plans can 
help streamline the early stages of litigation.  
Besides working to develop policies and information architecture maps, user education 
can alleviate much of the repetitive nature of the review process.  Topics to consider 
addressing with employees could include:
• How to properly respond to and forward e-mail: There is no need for email threads to 
extend what is necessary to understand a response.
• How to avoid death by CC:  Does the entire sales team really need to receive an 
attached copy of daily cumulative sales reports?
• Knowing what data you don’t need on your machine:  Customer databases should 
reside in a central location and never give multiple copies to individuals unless there is an 
absolute need.
• How to use the delete key:  I think this speaks for itself.
• How to use the telephone:  Many conversations should not be carried out over email, 
which will be retained and potentially become part of a court record.  
Security Risks Posed By Electronic Discovery
Financial risk is not the only one which is growing as a result of the use of electronic 
discovery.  By it’s very nature, discovery means giving your data to another party whom 
you do not control.  The discovery process can mean large volumes of data leaving your 
control and falling into the hands of:
• Your e-discovery processing vendor
• Your law ﬁrm
• The opponent’s law ﬁrm
• The opponent’s processing vendor
More e-discovery vendors are popping up every week, and many of them don’t take 
security as seriously as they should.  These organizations are a large target for attackers 
because they hold the data for not merely one, but often multiple organizations.  As your 
organization chooses a vendor to help you through the process, demand from them more 
than a cursory comment about granular user access controls and 128 bit SSL 
connections.
As you work with inside and outside counsel, all parties will beneﬁt greatly from the 
perspective offered by security specialists.  Attorneys have a difﬁcult enough time 
understanding technology in the larger sense, let alone the intricacies involved in hardening 
data security.  Help them understand that things like third party security audits and 
increased expectations of vendors decreases the risk of an information breach and helps 
them better to comply with their ethical obligations of conﬁdentiality.
Conclusion
I often ﬁnd it difﬁcult to explain to people what I do.  Most individuals, understandably,  
would have expected that the legal system would have been aggressively pursuing the rich 
opportunities for ﬁnding relevant information within computer systems years ago.  That is, 
unfortunately, not the case.  
Electronic discovery is currently creating a great deal of frustration for clients and attorneys 
because of the complexity and costs involved.  I believe that these are simply growing 
pains that the law is going through as we adjust to the new environment.  Anyone who has 
even a cursory knowledge of the US legal system knows that a plaintiff suing a large 
corporation is at a distinct disadvantage due to the costs involved in sifting through huge 
volumes of information.  Thankfully the days of a major corporate ﬁrm arriving at a small 
ﬁrm with trailers full of documents and microﬁche are now behind us.  
When I was in Washington for Shmoocon in February I made it a point to visit our seat of 
justice, the US Supreme Court.  The front of the courthouse reads “Equal Justice Under 
the Law.”
I believe that electronic discovery has the potential to level the playing ﬁeld for litigants in 
much the same way that the internet has for individual expression.  
It is always a pleasure to speak at DEFCON and I appreciate the opportunity to speak at 
Blackhat, and I look forward to seeing you all again soon.

Brainstorming and drafting of the presentation was done by hand in a Moleskinne 
notebook.  Computers were never meant to be an outlet of creativity when it comes to the 
written and spoken word.
The slides were created using Keynote 08 on various pieces of Apple hardware using 
photos from iStockphoto and Google in locations ranging from my fortiﬁed compound in 
Waldo to Midway Airport, the Wardman Park, the sweet spot in the hallway where an open 
AP could be found at the Washington Marriott, and the Smoking Oasis in Pasadena.  The
