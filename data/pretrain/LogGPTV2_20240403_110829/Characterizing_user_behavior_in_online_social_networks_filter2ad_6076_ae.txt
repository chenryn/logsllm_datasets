5.3 Number of friends interacted with
Finally we investigated how silent interactions aﬀect the
level of user interactions along the social network topol-
ogy. We compare the number of friends (including multi-
hop friends) a user interacts with through all activities with
the number interacted with through only visible activities,
as a function of the number of friends in the social graph.
Figure 9 shows these quantities. Overall, the degree of
interaction is very low; the average user interacted (whether
visibly or silently) with 3.2 friends in total over the 12-day
period and interacted visibly with only 0.2 friends. This low
level of interaction has also been observed in other work.
According to Wilson et al. [33], in the Facebook social net-
work nearly 60% of users exhibit no interaction at all over
an entire year. Therefore, our workload trace of 12 days is
expected to show a much lower level of interaction.
Figure 9: Comparison of the Orkut social graph de-
gree and interaction degree
Interestingly, even for a short trace period, the degree of
all interaction is 16 times or an order of magnitude greater
than the degree of visible interaction. The stark diﬀerence
in the two quantities may be because in OSN usage the ma-
jority of time is spent browsing, which cannot be captured
by visible interactions. Another trend that we observe is
that interaction degree does not grow rapidly with the user
degree in the social graph; users with low degree interacted
with a similar number of friends as users with high degree.
This indicates that it is easier to form friend links than to
actually interact with those friends.
In summary our analysis of social interaction in this sec-
tion brought out many interesting ﬁndings. When we con-
sider silent interactions like browsing friends’ pages, the
measured interaction among users signiﬁcantly increased. In
total, 55% of users in the workload trace interacted with at
least one other user during the 12-day period; 8% showed
at least one visible interaction and 47% showed only silent
interactions. This means that if one were to measure the
strength of social ties based on visible traces, such analysis
would be biased because 85% (=47/55) of the users would
be completely disregarded. Furthermore, considering silent
interactions increased the number of friends a user inter-
acts with by an order of magnitude over the 12-day period,
compared to only considering visible interactions.
6. DISCUSSION
Our measurement analysis provides many interesting ﬁnd-
ings that we think will be useful in various ways. We discuss
implications of the ﬁndings below.
Modeling of OSN sessions. In Section 3, we character-
ized the properties of individual session properties in OSN
workloads. Among various ﬁndings, here we highlight that
session quantities like inter-session times, session lengths,
and inter-request times follow a heavy-tailed distribution.
For example, the majority of the sessions remain short (on
the order of tens of minutes), but some sessions last sev-
eral hours to days. As a result of the asymmetry of the
distribution, user behaviors cannot be represented as a nor-
mal distribution with comparable mean and variance. Also
the typical behavior of users will not be the same as their
average behavior [15].
To incorporate the large variation in user behaviors, we
provided statistics for the average behavior as well as the
best ﬁt distribution functions that capture this asymmetry
(Section 3.3). Such distribution functions can be used to
generate synthetic (parameterizable) traces, that mimic ac-
tual OSN workloads. We hope that the statistics summa-
rized in the paper and the session modeling will be valuable
in evaluating and testing potential OSN services.
Understanding user activity in OSNs.
In Section 4,
we characterized the type, frequency, and sequence of user
activities in OSNs. Using clickstream data, we presented
a complete proﬁle of user activity in Orkut in Table 2 and
Figure 6. We also examined the diﬀerences and similari-
ties in user activity across multiple OSN sites. Our analy-
sis demonstrated that browsing, which cannot be identiﬁed
from visible data, is the most dominant behavior (92%).
We believe that understanding user activity is important
for OSN service providers and portals [3, 33] as well as for
advertising agencies [2]. This is because frequently repeated
activities (e.g., browsing home, browsing scraps) naturally

of activities can be analyzed to improve the website de-
sign. One application of our analysis is that an OSN service
provider may consider providing a personalized web interface
for users based on the users’ activity proﬁles. For example,
a user login page can be reorganized so that frequently re-
peated activities are more easily accessible. OSN service
providers may also use aggregate patterns in clickstreams
to identify users with similar behaviors (e.g., belonging to
the same communities, possessing similar proﬁle description)
and recommend popular content within the site.
Interaction over the social graph. In Section 5 we used
both the clickstream data and the social graph topology to
study how users interact with friends in OSNs. Among vari-
ous ﬁndings, we observed that Orkut users not only interact
with 1-hop friends, but also have substantial exposure to
friends that are 2 or more hops away (22%). This exposure
to friends’ pages has signiﬁcant implication for information
propagation in OSNs: OSNs exhibit “small-world” proper-
ties [1, 21, 33], which means that the network structure has
a potential to spread information quickly and widely. Our
observation highlighted that users actively visiting immedi-
ate and non-immediate friends’ pages serves as an empirical
precondition for word-of-mouth-based information propaga-
tion.
Especially when it comes to rich media content like videos
and photos, more than 80% of content was found through a
1-hop friend (Figure 7). This ﬁnding reinforces some of the
recent studies that emphasize the impact of word-of-mouth-
like information propagation through friends in social net-
works (the so called social cascade) [4, 5, 28]. As OSN traﬃc
is expected to grow rapidly [23], the patterns of social in-
teraction and information ﬂow can be valuable in designing
the next-generation Internet infrastructure and content dis-
tribution systems [16, 26]. For instance, by tracking down
the patterns of social cascade in OSNs and correlating them
with information about the geographical locations of users,
we can make an educated guess about the geographical re-
gions to which particular piece of content will likely spread.
Such predictions will allow for the design of eﬃcient content
distribution systems.
7. RELATED WORK
There are a rich set of studies on analyzing the workloads
of Web 2.0 services. Mislove et al. [21] studied graph the-
oretic properties of OSNs, based on the friends network of
Orkut, Flickr, LiveJournal, and YouTube. They conﬁrmed
the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties of these
OSN services. Ahn et al. [1] studied the network properties
of Cyworld, a popular OSN in South Korea. They com-
pared the explicit friend relationship network with the im-
plicit network created by messages exchanged on Cyworld’s
guestbook. They found similarities in both networks: the
in-degree and out-degree were close to each other and social
interaction through the guestbook was highly reciprocal.
Liben-Nowell et al. [19] analyzed the geographical loca-
tion of LiveJournal users and found a strong correlation be-
tween friendship and geographic proximity. Krishnamurthy
et al. [17] analyzed an OSN formed by users on Twitter.
They examined geographical spread of Twitter usage and
also analyzed user behavior in this environment. Huberman
et al. [14] showed that Twitter users have a small number
of friends compared to the number of followers they declare.
Golder et al. [11] analyzed temporal access and social pat-
terns in Facebook. They analyzed the message header ex-
changed by Facebook users, revealing periodic patterns in
terms of messages exchanged on that network. Gjoka et
al. [10] have studied application usage workloads in Face-
book and the popularity of applications. Nazir et al. [22]
similarly analyzed application characteristics in Facebook,
by developing and launching their own applications.
Wilson et al. [33] proposed the use of interaction graphs
to impart meaning to online social links by quantifying user
interactions. They analyzed interaction graphs derived from
Facebook user traces and showed that they exhibit signiﬁ-
cantly lower levels of the “small-world” properties shown in
their social graph counterparts. Valafar et al. [29] conducted
a measurement study of the Flickr OSN and showed that
only a small fraction of users in the main component of the
friendship graph is responsible for the vast majority of user
interactions.
Burke et al. [3] studied user motivations for contribut-
ing in social networking sites, based on server log data from
Facebook. They found that newcomers who see their friends
contributing go on to share more content themselves. Fur-
thermore, those who were initially inclined to contribute,
receiving feedback and having a wide audience, were also
predictors of increased sharing. Chapman and Lahav [6]
conducted survey interviews and analysis of web browsing
patterns of 36 users of four diﬀerent nationalities to examine
ethnographical diﬀerences in the usage of OSNs.
Compared to the studies above, we focused on characteriz-
ing the workload of all user activities, beyond use of a single
application and including all silent activities like browsing.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented a thorough characterization
of social network workloads, based on detailed clickstream
data summarizing HTTP sessions over a 12-day period of
37,024 users. The data were collected from a social network
aggregator website, which after a single authentication en-
ables users to connect to multiple social networks: Orkut,
MySpace, Hi5, and LinkedIn. We analyzed the statistical
and distributional properties of most of the important vari-
ables of OSN sessions. We presented the clickstream model
to characterize user behavior in online social networks.
Our study uncovered a number of interesting ﬁndings,
some of which are related to the speciﬁc nature of social net-
working environments. Many previous social network stud-
ies reconstructed user actions from “visible” artifacts, such
as comments and testimonials. Using the clickstream model,
we underscored the presence of “silent” user actions, such as
browsing a proﬁle page or viewing a photo of a friend. These
results led us to classify social interactions into two groups,
composed of publicly visible activities and silent activities,
respectively.
Our current and future work is focused on leveraging the
results presented in this paper along three main directions.
First, we would like to to investigate the impact of friends
on the behavior of user of social networks. The success of a
social networking site is directly associated with the quality
of content users share. Thus, in order to design social net-
work services, it is key to understand factors that motivate
users to join communities, become fans of something, and
upload or retrieve media content.
61Second, we are interested in understanding content dis-
tribution patterns across multiple OSNs. We would like to
know to what extent content is shared across OSN sites as
well as explore the impact of age, content, and geographical
locality in object popularity. Given that users participate in
multiple social networks, we expect that a user may share
the same content across multiple sites. Answering these
questions will let us explore opportunities for eﬃcient con-
tent distribution, for example, caching and pre-fetching, as
well as advertisement and recommendation strategies. For
instance, certain types of content may be popular either in
a speciﬁc geographical region or in a single social network,
in which case advertisement algorithms should be based on
this characteristic. On the other hand, if content is eas-
ily replicated across sites, then we can detect rising content
from one social networking site and implant it into another
site.
Lastly, based on our analysis, we plan to build a social
network workload generator that incorporates many of our
ﬁndings, including the statistical distributions of sessions
and requests and the Markov models for user behavior.
