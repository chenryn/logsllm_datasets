User:  For a non-optimized algorithm, the time complexity is often not ideal. Please describe the concept of time complexity and introduce some common time complexities.
Assistant: Time complexity refers to the relationship between the time required for an algorithm to execute and the size of the problem. The common time complexity from low to high is: - O(1): constant order, which means that the execution time of the algorithm does not increase with the increase of the problem size, and the execution time is stable. - O(log n): Logarithmic order, which means that the execution time of the algorithm increases slightly with the increase of the problem scale, and the execution time is relatively stable. - O(n): Linear order, which means that the execution time of the algorithm increases linearly with the scale of the problem, and the execution time has a certain growth trend. - O(n log n): The common time complexity of algorithms based on quick sort and merge sort, which means that the execution time of the algorithm increases with the increase of the problem size, and the growth rate is slightly faster than the linear order. - O(n^2): Square order, which means that the execution time of the algorithm increases with the square of the problem size, and the execution time increases faster. - O(2^n): Exponential order, which means that the execution time of the algorithm increases exponentially with the scale of the problem, and the execution time increases very fast, which is prone to problems. - O(n!): Factorial order, which means that the execution time of the algorithm increases with the factorial of the problem size, and the execution time increases exponentially, which is very inefficient. In the actual algorithm design, the algorithm with lower complexity is usually selected, and the efficiency is further improved by means of algorithm optimization and data structure optimization.
