#### Problem
Say you have a component template:
          aria-owns="autocomplete-menu">
        Alpha
In this example, use of an ID is necessary for the `aria-owns` attribute. With
the current shadow DOM emulation, it will not work to have multiple instances
of this component on the page at the same time because the IDs would be
duplicated.
Other use cases include ``, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-controls`, `aria-
described-by`, `aria-flowto`
#### Possible solutions
There are a few different ways we could handle this.
##### Put the burden on the user
This is what people would have done in Angular 1. Adopting this should just be
a matter of documentation.
##### Automatically recognize ID attributes and shim ID isolation
If the user writes:
Angular will recognize any standard attributes that use an ID reference (or
list of ID references) and automatically convert them into document-unique IDs
them.
##### Add some syntax to identify IDs for unique conversion
Specific syntax aside, something like:
This has the benefit of not having to hard-code the list of ID-reference
attributes, but still incurs the same performance cost as the previous
solution.
