## Abstract
Mobile users face significant risks of location privacy loss, such as through open advertisement networks and involuntary tracking in popular mobile social apps. This study introduces LocMask, a system-level solution for location privacy protection in the Android system. LocMask balances privacy and utility by providing on-demand Quality of Protection (QoP), setting different privacy levels based on the sensitivity of locations. It includes a location profile management module that records and ranks user mobility history to determine the sensitivity of each location. Additionally, LocMask supports various obfuscation techniques, enhancing its effectiveness, which is validated through extensive real-world data evaluations.

## 1. Introduction
Smartphones, along with a wide range of applications, have become essential tools for communication and coordination, recording not only calls but also sensitive information such as medical concerns, political preferences, and financial resources. Among the various privacy issues, location privacy leakage in smartphones is receiving increasing attention. For instance, 100 representative ad libraries are used in 52.1% of 100,000 apps, with 27 of the top 50 libraries requesting user location data [3]. Most of these ad libraries do not encrypt their requests, making location information public to both ad providers and network sniffers [6].

Another example of location privacy leakage comes from location-based social discovery apps like WeChat and Skout, which allow users to discover new friends based on proximity. Recent research [4] shows that attackers can precisely geolocate victims using public information. Studies have shown that four spatiotemporal points are sufficient to identify individuals in anonymized mobility datasets [2]. Location traces can reveal habits, interests, activities, and relationships, leading to unwanted advertisements, location-based spam, social reputation damage, property loss, and even blackmail or physical violence.

While several location privacy protection methods, such as k-anonymity, mix-zones, and obfuscation techniques, have been proposed, none provide a system-level solution for Android. In this study, we present LocMask, a system-level solution for location privacy protection in Android. LocMask has the following features:
1. **On-demand Quality of Protection (QoP)**: Balancing privacy and utility by setting different privacy levels for different locations.
2. **Automatic Location Profile Management**: Recording and ranking user mobility history to determine the sensitivity of locations.
3. **Compatibility with Existing Obfuscation Techniques**: Supporting a variety of obfuscation methods without replacing them.

## 2. Framework Design and Implementation

### 2.1 Design of LocMask
LocMask aims to provide location privacy protection for Android users while maintaining a high Quality of Protection (QoP). The framework assigns different privacy levels to different locations, balancing privacy and utility. To reduce the manual effort, it correlates privacy levels with the user's visiting frequency, recognizing that frequently visited locations (e.g., home or office) are more sensitive.

#### 2.1.1 Privacy Level Setting Module
LocMask automatically configures privacy levels based on user location profiles. Research shows that human mobility is predictable, with 94% of daily activities confined to a limited neighborhood [2]. More frequently visited locations are set to higher sensitivity levels, resulting in higher privacy protection and a larger obfuscation range. Users can also manually adjust privacy levels for specific locations or apps.

#### 2.1.2 Location Profile Building Module
The Location Profile Building Module collects and analyzes historical user trajectories to build location profiles. It models a user's trajectory as a function mapping time points to locations. By collecting a certain duration of user trajectories, the module generates a list of locations and their visit frequencies, distinguishing between highly sensitive (e.g., home, office) and less sensitive (e.g., shopping malls, cinemas) regions.

#### 2.1.3 Location Obfuscation Module
LocMask supports various obfuscation techniques, including distance-based obfuscation and cloaking. These techniques protect location privacy by degrading the quality of location information. LocMask provides a general interface for implementing these techniques, ensuring compatibility with existing LBS applications. It also integrates privacy level mechanisms into obfuscation techniques, achieving a balance between privacy and service quality.

### 2.2 Framework Implementation
We designed and implemented LocMask as a location-privacy preserving module in the Android system. The architecture consists of four components:

- **User-Specify Interface**: Allows users to specify location sharing preferences. This interface is implemented as a system application, scanning app manifests for location permissions and displaying geographic positions on a map.
- **Profile Generator**: Collects and stores user location information in a local database. It uses a clustering algorithm to extract and rank user location profiles.
- **Privacy-Level Recorder**: Saves privacy levels for each geographic position and LBS app. There are four privacy levels: low, medium, high, and very high. These levels are stored in an XML file and used to compute obfuscation ranges.
- **Obfuscation Engine**: Implements and executes obfuscation techniques. We added an `ObfuscateLocation()` function to the `LocationManager` class, which provides an interface for different obfuscation techniques. This function is called whenever an app requests location data, returning the obfuscated result.

### 2.3 Obfuscation Mechanism
LocMask uses a hybrid obfuscation method combining two techniques. The first technique, introduced in [1], uses radius enlargement, reduction, and center shifting. This method is used for low and medium privacy levels. For high and very high privacy levels, LocMask uses a novel technique that deviates obfuscation results to less sensitive public regions, such as shopping malls or cinemas.

## 3. Experiment and Results
We conducted a 3-week experiment with 15 volunteers using a modified Android system incorporating LocMask. During the first 2 weeks, we gathered location data to generate location profiles and allowed users to specify their privacy preferences. In the last week, LocMask began obfuscating location requests based on the generated profiles. Figure 3 shows the obfuscation results, demonstrating LocMask's effectiveness in protecting user location privacy.

## 4. Conclusion
This poster presents LocMask, a novel location-privacy preserving framework for the Android system. Without modifying existing LBS applications, LocMask provides tailored protection for each user. Future work will focus on incorporating advanced privacy-preserving techniques to enhance performance.
