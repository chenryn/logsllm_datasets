ABSTRACT
The mobile users are facing a serious risk of losing loca-
tion privacy (e.g., users’ location information transmitted
by open advertisement network, and the reported event of
involuntary tracking of mobile users in popular mobile social
apps). In this study, we design and implement LocMask, a
system-level solution that provides location privacy protec-
tion in Android system. LocMask achieves the tradeoﬀ of
the privacy and the utility of location based services by pro-
viding the Quality of Protection (QoP) on demand, which
sets diﬀerent privacy protection levels to diﬀerent locations
based on how sensitive these locations are. Motivated by the
fact that Top locations (e.g, user’s home or oﬃce) are more
sensitive than less visiting locations, LocMask provides loca-
tion pro(cid:12)le management module that records the user’s mo-
bility history and ranks the locations in terms of the user’s
visiting frequency. With users’ location pro(cid:12)les, LocMask
can automatically determines the sensitiveness of these loca-
tions as well as their corresponding privacy protection level.
LocMask is also designed to incorporate various obfuscation
techniques. The eﬀectiveness of LocMask is supported by
extensive real-world data based evaluations.

and other sensitive information. Among diﬀerent privacy is-
sues, location privacy leakage in smartphone is receiving an
increasing attention. It has been pointed out that 100 repre-
sentative ad libraries are used in 52.1% of 100000 apps and
27 of the top 50 libraries requesting user’s location data[3].
More seriously, most of the ad libraries don’t encrypt their
ad requests due to the extra overhead[6]. Thus, the location
information of numerous users is public to not only the ad
providers but also any network sniﬀers who can eavesdrop
ad traﬃc between users and ad providers.
Another typical example of location privacy leakage comes
from location-based social discovery apps (e.g., Wechat and
Skout) which allow the users to discover new friends based
on their proximity testing. A recent research [4] shows that
attackers can exactly geo-locate the victim by only exploit-
ing the public information of the users. Recent studies
have shown that four spatial-temporal points are suﬃcient
to identify the individuals in an anonymized mobility data
set[2]. Note that users’ location traces can leak much in-
formation about the individuals’ habits, interests, activities,
and relationships as pointed out in [5]. And loss of location
privacy can expose users to unwanted advertisement and
location-based spams/scams, cause social reputation dam-
age or property loss, and make them victims of blackmail or
even physical violence.
In the past years, there are quite a few works proposed
for location privacy protection including: k-anonymity, mix-
zone and various obfuscation techniques. However, none of
the existing works provide a system-level countermeasure for
location-privacy protection in smart phone systems such as
Android. In this study, we present LocMask, a system-level
solution that provides location privacy protection in Android
system. LocMask has the following features: 1. Providing
the Quality of Protection (QoP) on demand. It is motivated
by the following fact. On the one hand, the privacy comes
at a cost, and will inevitably reduce the utility of LBS ap-
plications. On the other hand, for a speci(cid:12)c user, diﬀerent
locations may potentially require diﬀerent privacy protec-
tion levels. For example, the Top 2 Locations of the user
(e.g., home or oﬃce) are closely relevant to his identity and
thus require a high privacy protection level while the public
regions (e.g, shopping malls or cinema) need a relatively low
privacy protection. 2. Determining the privacy level based
on automatic location pro(cid:12)le management as well as user’s
preference. LocMask provides location pro(cid:12)le management
module that records the user’s mobility history and ranks
the places in terms of the user’s visiting frequency to deter-
1526mine the sensitiveness of these places as well as their cor-
responding privacy protection level. LocMask also provides
(cid:13)exibility for users to determine their privacy level based on
their personal preferences. 3. Being compatible to the ex-
isting obfuscation techniques, LocMask will be compatible
to rather than be a replacement of the existing obfuscation
techniques. In other words, a diversi(cid:12)ed range of obfuscation
techniques can be adopted in LocMask.
2. FRAMEWORK DESIGN AND IMPLEMEN-
TATION
In this section, we will introduce LocMask, a novel loca-
tion privacy protection framework in Android, and explain
the strategies behind it.
2.1 Design of LocMask
LocMask aims to provide location privacy protection for
Android users without signi(cid:12)cantly reducing the Quality of
Protection (QoP) of users. The basic idea of LocMask is
assigning diﬀerent privacy levels to diﬀerent locations to
achieve the balance of the privacy and the utility. To re-
duce the load of manually setting the value to each location,
we correlate the privacy level of each location to the user’s
visiting frequency, which is motivated from the fact that the
locations with a higher visiting frequency are more closely
related to the user’s identity and thus more sensitive to this
user (e.g., Top Locations). In general, LocMask is comprised
of the following modules: Privacy Level Setting Module, Lo-
cation Pro(cid:12)le Learning Module and Obfuscation Module.
2.1.1 Privacy Level Setting Module
As described above, LocMask allows the automatic pri-
vacy level con(cid:12)guration for Android users by correlating the
privacy level with their location pro(cid:12)les. The existing re-
searchers show that the human’s mobility is generally pre-
dictable and 94% indiviuals’ daily activity is con(cid:12)ned to a
limited neighborhood of less than 100 km[2]. By obtaining
the location pro(cid:12)les of users, the more frequently visiting
locations will be set to a higher sensitive level, which leads
to a higher privacy protection level and a bigger obfuscation
range.
In case that the privacy levels do not fully match
users’ preferences, LocMask also allows the users to set the
privacy levels for speci(cid:12)c locations or apps.
2.1.2 Location Proﬁle Building Module
One of the main features of LocMask is to correlate the
privacy protection levels of diﬀerent locations with users’
location pro(cid:12)les, which can naturally diﬀerentiate the Top
locations (oﬃce or home) from other less sensitive regions
(public regions). Location Pro(cid:12)le Building Module is de-
signed to collect users’ historical trajectory and then build
users’ location pro(cid:12)les. We model the trajectory of a spe-
ci(cid:12)c user U as a function mapping a time point in T to
the user’s location in R at that time, i.e., (cid:11)u : T ! R.
Thus, if the user traverses k POIs for k diﬀerent time slots,
the real mobility traces of the user u can be denoted as
M =; : : : ; >. By collect-
ing a certain duration of users’ trajectory, Location pro(cid:12)le
building module will obtain the location list of the users as
well as the possibilities of visiting these locations.
2.1.3 Location Obfuscation Module
LocMask can support various obfuscation techniques, in-
cluding: distance-based obfuscation, cloaking techniques,
and etc [1]. Obfuscation techniques protect a user’s location
privacy by deliberately degrading the quality of information
about that user’s location. LocMask provides a general in-
terface for each obfuscation mechanism to intercept the orig-
inal locations and return the obfuscated results. With this
interface, each obfuscation technique can be easily imple-
mented in Android and existing LBS applications don’t need
any modi(cid:12)cation. Moreover, LocMask can incorporate pri-
vacy level mechanism into existing obfuscation techniques,
which can achieve a balance of location privacy and the QoP
of location-based service.

2.2 Framework Implementation
Based on the strategies discussed above, we designed and
implemented LocMask as a location-privacy preserving mod-
ule in Android system. Figure 1 illustrates the baseline ar-
chitecture of LocMask, which comprises of four components.
User-specify Interface: Provides an interface for users
to specify their location sharing preferences. User-specify
interface was implemented as an system application in An-
droid as shown in Figure 2. This application can report the
LBS apps by scanning the manifest (cid:12)le to (cid:12)nd ACCESS COA-
RSE LOCATION or ACCESS FINE LOCATION permis-
sion. The application can also show the geographic positions
in a map. And then users can specify privacy preserving
level for LBS apps and geographic positions to meet their
requirements.
Pro(cid:12)le Generator: Collects user’s location information
and stores user’s mobility history in the local database. We
implemented a LocationPro(cid:12)le class in Android framework.
This class provides methods to execute clustering algorithm
in the mobility data set, and then extract user’s location pro-
(cid:12)le. Location pro(cid:12)le records user’s Top N locations, which
will be assigned privacy preserving level according to their
sensitiveness.
Privacy-level Recorder: Saves the privacy preserving
level for each geographic position and LBS app. There are
four privacy levels in LockMask, which are low, medium,
1527and user’s preferences. Figure 3 shows some original and
obfuscated locations of a volunteer. Blue points are origi-
nal locations. Yellow points are obfuscated results from the
(cid:12)rst obfuscation technique and green points from the second
technique as described in 2.3. We can see that LocMask can
successfully obfuscate users’ location and protect their loca-
tion privacy.

high and very high. Privacy level information is stored as
XML (cid:12)le in the SystemDir of Android (cid:12)le system and will
be used to compute obfuscation range in our obfuscating
process.
Obfuscation Engine: Implements obfuscation techniques
and executes obfuscation process. We add a function, Ob-
fuscateLocation(), in LocationManager class. ObfuscateLo-
cation() provides the interface for diﬀerent obfuscation tech-
niques. Parameters of this function are the original location
and the package name of query app, which can be used to
query privacy level. We also modi(cid:12)ed Android location re-
questing APIs so that whenever they are invoked by a query
app, they will call obfuscateLocation() and return the ob-
fuscated result to the query app.
2.3 Obfuscation Mechanism
We implemented a hybrid obfuscation method for Loc-
Mask. This hybrid method includes two diﬀerent obfusca-
tion techniques. The (cid:12)rst obfuscation technique is intro-
duced in [1]. There are three basic obfuscation operators
in this technique, which are radius enlargement, radius re-
duction and center shifting. LocMask executes obfuscation
by randomly combining these obfuscation operators. This
obfuscation technique will be selected when privacy level is
low or medium (or the LBS has a certain requirement on
the precision).
For the privacy level high or very high or LBS only needs
a low requirement on the precision (for example, the loca-
tion based advertisements normally have a low requirement
for the precision), LocMask uses a novel obfuscation tech-
nique, which let obfuscation results deviate to the public
region (e.g, shopping malls or cinema). Users don’t want to
disclose their real locations in these privacy levels, so Loc-
Mask tries to disguise user’s location as public region, which
is less sensitive and informative. This technique is useful for
defending malicious or unwanted location requests.
3. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS
We conducted a 3-week experiment to test LocMask. 15
volunteers attended this experiment by using the modi(cid:12)ed
Android system which incorporates LocMask. In the (cid:12)rst
2 weeks, we gathered each user’s location data to generate
location pro(cid:12)le. We also let users specify their location pre-
serving preferences.
In the last week, LocMask began to
obfuscate each location request according to location pro(cid:12)le

4. CONCLUSION
In this poster, we present a novel location-privacy pre-
serving framework, LocMask, in Android system. Without
any change on existing LBS applications, our framework
can provide tailored protection for each user. For our fu-
ture work, we are planning to incorporate other advanced
privacy-preserving technics into our framework to get bet-
ter performance.
