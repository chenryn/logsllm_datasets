No. CV-06-2555-PHX-DGC
ORDER AND
PERMANENT INJUNCTION
This case concerns the World of Warcraft computer game (“WoW”) and a software
program known as Glider that plays WoW for its owners while those owners are away from
their computer keyboards.   MDY Industries, Inc. (“MDY”), the owner and distributor of
Glider, sought a declaratory judgment that Glider does not infringe rights owned by Blizzard
Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi Games, Inc. (collectively, “Blizzard”), the owners and
distributors of WoW.  Dkt. #5.  Blizzard filed a counterclaim and a third-party complaint
against Michael Donnelly, the founder of MDY.  Blizzard asserted seven claims:  tortious

interference with contract, contributory copyright infringement, vicarious copyright
infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), trademark
infringement, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment.  Dkt. #10.
The Court granted in part the parties’ summary judgment motions.  The Court held
MDY liable to Blizzard for tortious interference with contract, contributory copyright
infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement.  The Court granted summary judgment
to MDY on the portion of Blizzard’s claim based on the DMCA that applied to Blizzard’s
game client software code.  The Court also granted summary judgment in favor of MDY on
Blizzard’s unfair competition claim.  Dkt. #82.
Blizzard filed a motion for a permanent injunction on its tortious interference and
copyright infringement claims.  Dkt. #84.  The Court denied the motion without prejudice.
Dkt. #91.
Following this ruling, Blizzard dismissed its trademark infringement and unjust
enrichment claims and the parties stipulated that Blizzard would recover $6,000,000 in
damages from MDY on the tortious interference and copyright infringement claims if any
one of those claims is affirmed on appeal.  Dkt. ##94-95.  The parties agreed that the Court
should hold a bench trial to decide the remaining claims under the DMCA, whether Donnelly
is personally liable to Blizzard, and whether Blizzard is entitled to a permanent injunction.
Dkt. ##92, 96.
The bench trial was held on January 8 and 9, 2009.  Dkt. ##100-02.  The Court issued
an order setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law on January 28, 2009.  The
Court concluded that MDY is liable under the DMCA, that Donnelly is personally liable for
MDY’s tortious interference, copyright infringement, and DMCA violations, and that
Blizzard is entitled to a permanent injunction.  Dkt. #108.  
As requested by the Court (see id. at 22), the parties have filed memoranda addressing
three issues:  (1) the scope of the injunction, (2) whether the injunction should be stayed
pending appeal, and (3) what bond should be imposed for Blizzard’s protection pending
appeal.  Dkt. ##109, 111.

I.
Scope of the Injunction.
Injunctive relief “is historically ‘designed to deter, not punish[.]’”  Rondeau v.
Mosinee Paper Corp., 422 U.S. 49, 62 (1975) (citation omitted).  In issuing a permanent
injunction, “a district court should only include injunctive terms that have a common sense
relationship to the needs of the specific case, and the conduct for which a defendant has
been held liable.”  MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 518 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1126-27 (C.D.
Cal. 2007) (citing NLRB v. Express Publ’g Co., 312 U.S. 426, 435 (1941)).  “‘[B]lanket
injunctions to obey the law are disfavored.’”  Id. at 1226 (citation omitted).
MDY has been found liable for tortious interference with the contract between
Blizzard and WoW users, contributory and vicarious infringement of Blizzard’s copyrights
in WoW, and  violations of the DMCA.  See Dkt. ##82, 108.  The Court will enjoin MDY
from engaging in acts “which are the same type and class as [the] unlawful acts which the
[C]ourt has found to have been committed” by MDY.  Express Publ’g Co., 312 U.S. at 435;
see Rondeau 422 U.S. at 62 (injunctive relief was designed “to permit the court ‘to mould
each decree to the necessities of the particular case’”) (citation omitted); Aluminum Workers
Int’l Union v. Consol. Aluminum Corp., 696 F.2d 437, 446 (6th Cir. 1982) (“the scope of
relief should be strictly tailored to accomplish only that which the situation specifically
requires”).  To ensure that the injunctions are specifically tailored, separate injunctions are
set forth at the end of this order for (1) the copyright and DMCA claims and (2) the tortious
interference claim.
II.
Stay of Injunction Pending Appeal.
MDY seeks a stay of the injunctions pending appeal.  Dkt. #111.  The Court has
discretion to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Such a stay “is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted sparingly.”  Ariz. Contractors
Ass’n, Inc. v. Candelaria, No. CV07-02496-PHX-NVW, 2008 WL 486002, at *1 (D. Ariz.
Feb. 19, 2008) (citations omitted); see In re GTI Capital Holdings, LLC, No. 03-07923-SSC,
2008 WL 961112, at *6 (D. Ariz. Bankr. Apr. 4, 2008).  MDY “carries a heavy burden to
demonstrate that the stay is warranted.”  McCammon v. United States, 584 F. Supp. 2d 193,

197 (D.D.C. 2008); see Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ. v. Scott, 404 U.S. 1221,
1231 (1971) (Burger, C.J.).  MDY must show either (1) “‘a probability of success on the
merits and the possibility of irreparable injury’” or (2) “‘that serious legal questions are
raised and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor.’”  Golden Gate Rest. Ass’n
v. City & County of S.F., 512 F.3d 1112, 1115-16 (9th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted); see
Stormans Inc. v. Selecky, 526 F.3d 406, 408 (9th Cir. 2008); Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S.
770, 776 (1987).  The Court must also consider whether a stay will harm Blizzard and
whether the public interest supports the issuance of a stay.  See id.
A.
Stay of the Copyright and DMCA Claims.
1.
Likelihood of Success or Serious Questions Raised on Appeal.
MDY and Donnelly assert that serious questions exist concerning the correctness of
the Court’s ruling on the copyright and DMCA claims, and even attach draft articles and
third-party commentary suggesting that the Court’s rulings are incorrect.  Dkt. #111-3.  The
Court fully recognizes that these issues are debatable and that reasonable minds can disagree
on whether the copyright and DMCA claims were decided correctly.  See Dkt. #108 at 22.
The Court has applied binding Ninth Circuit law on the scope of a license (Dkt. #82 at 6-12),
whether purchasers of WoW software “own” the software for purposes of 17 U.S.C. § 117(a)
(Dkt. #82 at 13-16), and whether copying to RAM constitutes “copying” for purposes of the
Copyright Act (Dkt. #82 at 6 & n. 4).  The Court recognizes that the Ninth Circuit may
choose to reconsider its position on some or all of these issues during the appeal of this case.
The Court therefore concludes that the appeal will raise serious questions concerning the
copyright and DMCA claims.
2.
Balance of Hardships.
The Court must decide whether the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of MDY
and Donnelly.  See Golden Gate Rest. Ass’n, 512 F.3d at 1115-16.  The Court concludes that
it does.  Although Blizzard spends approximately $83,000 per month combating Glider and
other bots, MDY and Donnelly note that Blizzard makes approximately $1,500,000 per
month from WoW.  The quantifiable injury to Blizzard from staying the injunction will thus

amount to less than one-tenth of one percent of its monthly revenue.  MDY and Donnelly,
by contrast, would likely be put out of business by the permanent injunction.  Even if the
permanent injunction ultimately is eliminated on appeal, MDY and Donnelly likely will have
lost all of their market share to competitors during the duration of the appeal and will be
unable to regain their business.  Given the serious questions to be raised on appeal by the
copyright and DMCA claims, the Court concludes that the hardships to be suffered by MDY
and Donnelly from a permanent injunction substantially outweigh the hardships to be
suffered by Blizzard if the injunction is stayed pending appeal.  See In re Hayes
Microcomputer Prods., Inc. Patent Litig., 766 F. Supp. 818, 823 & n.4 (N.D. Cal. 1991)
(balance of hardships favored stay of injunction where the defendants “could conceivably be
put out of business before an appeal is even heard”).
3.
Public Interest.
As the Court previously has noted, public interest would seem to favor preservation
of Blizzard’s copyright interests and termination of the exploitation of WoW by MDY and
Donnelly.  Dkt. #82 at 24-25.  On the other hand, the Court of Appeals may change its
position on pivotal legal issues in this case, resulting in a different outcome.  Given that
