User: I want to run a python script for several days, performing a huge database calculation, on a "public" windows computer in my work place. 
Since this task is important, I want to prevent closing it from the task manager. 
Is it possible to protect a python script from being closed by the task manager (windows xp)? If it is, how?
Assistant: Hopefully you aren't giving "public" general users administrative privileges. Don't give the public account permission to close your script. Then you just run your script from a different user account than the account the general public can use.
