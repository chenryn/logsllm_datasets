• Let H0 : {0, 1}∗ → {s1,··· , st} ⊆ {1,··· , ℓ} be an
identity mapping function, which maps an arbitrary
identity string to a t-size subset of {1,··· , ℓ}.
• Construct an identity map function H1 : {0, 1}∗ → G2
based on H0.
• Choose a pseudorandom number generator RN G over
Fq, which takes ID ∈ {0, 1}∗
as its seed.
The system params are (q, G1, G2, e, PV, H0, H1, RN G). The
master key is SV. The message space is M = {0, 1}n.
KeyGen. For a given identity ID ∈ {0, 1}∗
performs the following:
, the algorithm
• Compute H0(ID) → {s1,··· , st}.
• Seeding RN G with ID, generate pseudorandom sequences
(α1,··· , αt, β11,··· , βtt) ∈ Fq.

Note that xID = logg(yID). This enables any discrete loga-
rithm based public key system to be used as the encryption
primitive [9].
Encrypt. A message m ∈ M is encrypted for ID as follows.
• Select r ∈ ZZq at random and compute U = gr.
• Compute K = H1(yr
• Parse K as K1||K2.
• Compute V = Es(K1, M ), W = T (K2, V ).
• The ciphertext is (U, V, W ).

(Note that yID can be computed in the same way as yID in the
KeyGen algorithm is computed solely using a given identity
and the public parameter. This is not mentioned in [9], so
we clarify it in our description.)
Decrypt. To decrypt a ciphertext C = (U, V, W ), encrypt-
ed under ID, the secret key holder conducts the following.
• Compute K1||K2 = H1(U xID ).
• Check whether W ?= T (K2, V ).
• If it passes the veri(cid:12)cation, then output M = Ds(K1, V ).
Else output reject.
4. ANALYSIS OF CHEN ET AL.’S IDENTITY-
BASED ENCRYPTION
Theorem 1. Chen et al.’s identity-based encryption scheme
[9] is insecure in the sense of IND-sID-CCA.
Proof. Let A be an adversary that is permitted to issue a
polynomial number of extraction queries. Taking a closer
look at the extraction queries, each query will provide the
following knowledge to A.
xID =
αidsi +
βijdsi dsj
for H0(ID) → {s1,··· , st}.
To avoid confusion, for each query k with IDk, the set of
pseudorandom sequences is denoted as (α1k ,··· , αtk , β11k ,··· ,
βttk ) ∈ Fq. After executing a polynomial number of extrac-
tion queries, say m times1, then A will acquire the following
set of knowledge.
xID0 =

selected in the Setup algorithm. Hence, the above problem
constitutes MQ(q, ℓ, m) problem.
This problem is known to be NP-hard for any (cid:12)eld. The
complexity of MQ problem depends on the size of q. Never-
theless, we note the following.
When the number of equations m is the same as the num-
ber of unknowns, ℓ, then the best known algorithms are
exhaustive search for small (cid:12)elds, and a Gr(cid:127)obner bases al-
gorithm for large (cid:12)elds. Unfortunately, Gr(cid:127)obner bases al-
gorithm has large exponential complexity, and in practice,
it cannot solve a system with ℓ ≥ 15. Hence, to make the
scheme secure, one might think to select ℓ ≥ 15 to avoid
this attack. However, Kipnis and Shamir [13] introduced an
algorithm called \relinearization". While the exact complex-
ity of this algorithm is unknown, for su(cid:14)ciently overde(cid:12)ned
systems, it was expected to run in polynomial time. Further-
more, Courtois, Klimov, Patarin and Shamir created the XL
algorithm [11], which is an improvement of the relineariza-
tion technique by Kipnis and Shamir. For all 0 < ϵ < 1
and m ≥ ϵℓ2, XL and relinearization are expected to run in
2
polynomial time of approximately ℓ
Using the adversary A which can recover the master key
(the secret vector SV), one can easily construct an adversary
that can break Chen et al’s scheme in the IND-sID-CCA sense.
O(1/
√
ϵ).
We do note that Chen et al. recommended a fairly large
number for ℓ, say 512, hoping to prevent the attack present-
ed above. However, what we argue in this paper is that un-
less exponentially large ℓ is used, the IND-sID-CCA of Chen
et al’s scheme can be broken by the polynomial-time adver-
sary, which invalidates the security result (proof) presented
in [9]. (In other words, the recommended size 512 for ℓ is
not su(cid:14)cient to prevent the attack but if ℓ is exponentially
large, the scheme can not be used in practice.)
We also note that independently, in the recent work in
[2], Albrecht and Patterson demonstrated a re(cid:12)ned attack
which is more e(cid:14)cient than ours.
We remark that the di(cid:14)culty in adopting the structure
of the MQ problem to the key extraction algorithm of the
identity-based encryption stems from the adversary’s ability
to make a number of key extraction queries at will. Using the
private keys he has queried, the adversary can form a set of of
equations (in polynomial time) to apply the XL algorithm.
In order to to prevent the attack, one can choose l which
is exceptionally larger (almost exponentially larger) than
m. However, in this case, the size of PV(= (d1P,··· , dℓP ))
should also be exponentially large, which makes Chen et al.’s
identity-based encryption scheme impractical (if not impos-
sible to use).
Based on the above theorem, we obtain the following corol-
lary.
Corollary 1. In contrast to the claim made in [9], the
extract algorithm in [9] implies an insecure short signature
scheme.
5. CONCLUSION
In ASIACCS 2010, Chen, Charlemagne, Guan, Hu and
Chen [9] proposed an interesting identity-based encryption
scheme based on DHIES. They claimed that their scheme is
secure in the sense of IND-sID-CCA. In this paper, we demon-
strated that unfortunately, their scheme (which is either in
379
the original description or in our modi(cid:12)cation) is insecure.
The implication of our analysis is that to (cid:12)x the scheme, ex-
ponentially large public parameter should be used but this
is impossible to be realized in practice.
