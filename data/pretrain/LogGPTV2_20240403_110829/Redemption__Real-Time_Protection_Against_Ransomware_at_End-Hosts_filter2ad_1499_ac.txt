### TeslaCrypt, Virlock, and SilentCrypt: Ransomware Analysis

**Total Samples: 504**

- **Score Median:**
  - File Recovery Median: 0.41
  - Other Metrics: 0.36, 0.4, 0.49, 0.38, 0.53, 0.42, 0.52, 0.52, 0.43, 0.51, 0.31, 0.43, 0.73, 0.77, 0.79, 0.71, 0.75, 0.73, 0.69, 0.66, 0.76, 0.79, 0.72, 0.59, 0.73

- **Recovery Rate:**
  - TeslaCrypt: 5
  - Virlock: 4
  - SilentCrypt: 6
  - Others: 3, 7, 3, 4, 5, 2, 4, 3, 9, 4

The system's recovery rate remains stable even when it encounters unknown ransomware families that use different attack techniques (e.g., different cryptosystems). The results indicate that the number of files exposed to ransomware does not significantly change if Redemption is not trained on unseen ransomware families. This suggests that the system can effectively detect a significant number of unseen ransomware attacks.

### Disk I/O and File System Performance Evaluation

To evaluate the disk I/O and file system performance of Redemption, we used IOzone, a well-known file system benchmark tool for Windows. We generated 100 Ã— 512 MB files to test the throughput of block write, rewrite, and read operations. Additionally, we tested standard file system operations by creating and accessing 50,200 files, each containing 1 MB of data in multiple directories. All experiments were repeated 10 times, and the average scores were calculated to obtain the final results. We used AutoIt to automate the tasks.

**Results:**
- **Redemption Performance:**
  - Heavy reads and writes: Overhead of 2.8% and 3.4%, respectively.
  - Rewrite and create operations: Slowdowns ranging from 7% to 9% with many small files.
  - Not suitable for workloads involving many small files (e.g., compiling large software projects).
  - Designed for typical user activities (e.g., web browsing, writing text, sending emails).

**Protected Area Management:**
- The protected area can maintain several files without committing them to the disk.
- In scenarios with frequent read operations after writes (e.g., databases), read operations should also be redirected to the protected area.
- Benchmarking on the protected area shows a performance overhead of less than 3.1% for read operations when maintaining 100 files with a median size of 17.4 MB.
- This number of files is significantly larger than the maximum needed to identify suspicious processes.

### Conclusion

Redemption demonstrates robust performance in protecting against ransomware, with minimal overhead for typical user activities. However, it may experience performance degradation in high-workload scenarios involving many small files. The system's ability to manage a protected area efficiently ensures effective detection and protection against a wide range of ransomware families.
