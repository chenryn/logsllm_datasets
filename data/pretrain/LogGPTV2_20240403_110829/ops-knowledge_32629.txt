User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Domain non-Administrator account with some elevated privileges I'd like to create an account that is not a domain admin, so user cannot log into ADUaC, GP editor, etc but has privileges to access the Event Viewer, install printer drivers and applications on a client PC.

This will be for a student worker to help ease our workload and do basic troubleshooting. How can I create this type of ac

Assistant: Well, it seems that all the privileges are needed on the client side of things, so just add the student worker as a local administrator on all the machines that they'll need access to. Give them a normal domain user account and use Restricted Groups in group policy to add the user to the local Administrators group of the client machines.
