## 1. Motivation

Popular Internet applications often depend on specific data path characteristics [3,5]. Studies have shown that non-default Internet paths can exhibit significantly different quality characteristics compared to default paths [2,1]. However, the current Internet routing infrastructure does not fully leverage these observations. Recently proposed routing architectures [4] offer the potential to address this by allowing more dynamic and informed route selection. This work explores the possibility of using measured path properties to inform route selection.

Specifically, we observe that Tier-1 and other large ISPs, from their vantage points in the Internet topology, typically have multiple possible routes to reach most destination prefixes. By monitoring routing information, we track the availability of alternative paths. We also perform detailed measurements of loss and delay to a large number of Internet destinations to characterize these alternate paths. Our goals are:
1. To determine if there are significant differences in the properties of these different paths that would warrant their consideration in the route selection process.
2. To assess the stability of these properties over various timescales, which will influence how they can be utilized and the requirements for a measurement infrastructure.

This is, to our knowledge, the first study involving a single Tier-1 ISP.

## 2. Measurement Informed Route Selection

Our approach is illustrated in Figure 2. Consider a source \( s_1 \) and a destination \( d_1 \). \( s_1 \) connects to network AS0 at ingress router \( i_1 \). Network AS0 has two paths to reach \( d_1 \): through egress router \( e_2 \) and network AS1, and through egress router \( e_3 \) and network AS2. To determine the "best" path, we assume the existence of a measurement infrastructure that provides performance measurements for the paths between the ingress router and the egress routers, and from each egress router to the destination.

For simplicity, we ignore the ingress and egress router notation and assume that a measurement source is co-located with each router in AS0. The set of measurements between the ingress router and the egress routers is denoted by \( M_{s_1,s_2} \) and \( M_{s_1,s_3} \), and those between the egress routers and the destination by \( M_{s_2,d_1} \) and \( M_{s_3,d_1} \). Given this information, a network with the appropriate routing infrastructure [4] can select the "best" route between \( s_1 \) and \( d_1 \) by combining the measured characteristics along the two available composite paths \( (s_1, s_2, d_1) \) and \( (s_1, s_3, d_1) \).

In this abstract, we present initial results from a measurement study evaluating the benefits of such Measurement Informed Route Selection compared to the default BGP route selection as observed in a Tier-1 ISP.

## 3. Methodology

### Composite Performance Metrics

Given loss and delay \((\lambda_1, \delta_1)\) on the path \((s_1, s_2)\) and \((\lambda_2, \delta_2)\) on \((s_2, d_1)\), the composite transmission rate for the composite path \((s_1, s_2, d_1)\) is the product \(1 - \lambda = (1 - \lambda_1)(1 - \lambda_2)\). The composite delay is the sum \(\delta = \delta_1 + \delta_2\). The composite metric for loss \(\lambda(s_1,s_2,d_1),t\) at time \(t\) is the composite of the most recent measurements \(\lambda(s_1,s_2),t\) and \(\lambda(s_2,d_1),t\) on the internal and external segments, and similarly for delay \(\delta\).

### Performance Advantage of Alternate Routes

A route trajectory for a source-destination (SD) pair \((s, d)\) specifies, for each time \(t\), a source \(\sigma(t)\) which is \(s\) if the default path is used, and \(s' \neq s\) if an alternate path \((s, s', d)\) is used. The loss advantage of using a route trajectory \(\sigma\) is \(L(\sigma(t), t) = \lambda(s,d),t - \lambda(s,\sigma(t),d),t\), i.e., the difference between the most recent performance metric on the default path and the alternate path \((s, \sigma(t), d)\). The delay advantage \(D(\sigma(t), t)\) is defined similarly.

### Available Performance Advantage

The available performance advantage represents a baseline benefit that would be obtained by a routing policy enabling instant selection of the best performing path whenever new direct or composite measurements become available. Figure 2 illustrates delay measurements for a default path and two alternates. In each case, the curve shows the value of the most recent measurement on that path, forming a right-continuous step function. In the interval \([t_1, t_2)\), alternate 1 has the best most recent performance; in \([t_2, t_3)\), alternate 2 is best; in \([t_3, t_4)\), alternate 1 is best again; prior to \(t_1\) and after \(t_4\), the default route is best. The available delay advantage is positive only in \([t_1, t_4)\).

### Temporal Performance Advantage Metric

We analyze the duration of runs of performance advantage, i.e., maximal time intervals in which the available performance advantage for a given SD pair exceeds a given level. Longer runs are more useful, as the payoff for switching routes is longer-lived. If runs are shorter than the typical settle-down time after route changes, the period of advantage would be over before its benefit could be utilized. Our delay run performance statistic is the time fraction \(F_D(\tau, \delta)\): the fraction of the measurement interval that a given SD pair spent in a delay advantage run of duration greater than \(\tau\) and whose performance advantage exceeds \(\delta\), for each \(\tau, \delta > 0\).

### Summary

Our initial results show the potential benefits of Measurement Informed Route Selection:
1. There is significant choice in terms of alternate paths to reach Internet destinations.
2. Significant benefits in loss (at least 2%) and delay (at least 20ms) last for time periods that can be exploited by routing.
