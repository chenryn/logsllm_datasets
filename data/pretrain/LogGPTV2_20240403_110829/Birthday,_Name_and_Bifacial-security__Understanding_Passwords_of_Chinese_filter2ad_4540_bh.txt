4This situation even held at Aug. 2017 (and April 2019):
In 2012, Bonneau [7] cast doubt on the hypothesis
that users rationally select more secure passwords to
protect their more important accounts. In 2013, Egelman
et al. [17] initiated a ﬁeld study involving 51 students
and conﬁrmed this hypothesis.
In 2018, Stobert and
Biddle [46] surveyed three groups of English speaking
users (i.e., 27 non-experts, 15 experts and 345 MTurk
participants), and their results also corroborated this
hypothesis. Fortunately, our work provides a large-
scale empirical evidence (i.e., on the basis of 6.43M
CSDN passwords and 16.26M Dodonew passwords) that
conﬁrms this hypothesis.
(e.g.,
We also note that
though the overall security of
Dodonew passwords is higher than that of passwords
from the ﬁve other Chinese sites, many seemingly

appear in other less sensitive sites. This can be under-
stood: 1) “Users never see other users’ passwords” [47]
(and are unaware of how similar their passwords are
with other users, and thus they may inadvertently
choose popular passwords; 2) Users tend to reuse the
same password across multiple sites [27, 42, 56]. What’s
more, users generally “show a lack of
situation
awareness”
to recognize different
categories of accounts [41], and most of them reuse
(84% [27]) or simply modify a password from an
important site for a non-important site.
and fail
[46]
Further considering the great password burden already
placed on users [8] and the “bounded rationality” [27]
and “ﬁnite-effort” [20] of users, we outline the need for

HCI research to explore nudges that appropriately frame
the importance of accounts and study their impacts on
password creation. When designing password creation
policies, instead of merely insisting on stringent rules,
administrators can employ such nudges to help users
gain more accurate perceptions of the importance of the
accounts to be protected and improve their ability to
recognize different categories of accounts. Both would
help enhance user internal impetus and facilitate users to
responsibly allocate passwords (i.e., selecting one can-
didate from their limited pool of passwords memorized
[41, 46]).
In addition, the ﬁnding of “bifacial-security nature”
suggests that Chinese passwords are more vulnerable to
online guessing attacks. This is because top popular
Chinese passwords are more concentrated (see Table 3).
Thus, a special blacklist that includes a moderate number
of most common Chinese passwords (e.g., 10K∼20K as
suggested in [61]) would be very helpful for Chinese
sites to resist against online guessing. Such a blacklist
can be learned from various leaked Chinese datasets
(see a concrete list at http://t.cn/RG88tvF as built
according to [56]). Any password falling into this list
would be deemed weak. However, it is well known that if
some popular passwords (e.g., woaini1314) are banned,
new popular ones (e.g., w0aini1314) will arise. These
