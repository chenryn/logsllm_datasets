User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Remote desktop sessions - Unwanted automatic log off after period of time I'm having an issue whenever I connect to any of our servers via RDP -
After a certain period of time, it seems to close these sessions, closing all the applications i had open etc...

This is particularly annoying if I am running a long process - for example, copying a file - it cuts it off...
I then re-connect via RDP, and it effectively loads a new session.

Is this set somewhere in Group Policy? Or somewhere else?

This is happening on Windows 2008 (it may also be on our 2003 servers, although I haven't noticed...)

Assistant: The first thing to check would be the timeout settings in Terminal Services Configuration. It's in the Sessions tab in the TSC.
