a higher SNR than the legitimate signal, HODOR can easily
detect an ampliﬁcation attack. We found that the adversary
can achieve the same SNR level as the legitimate signal at a
distance of between 20 and 25 meters. Then, we sampled the
forwarded signals on the vehicle side. Fig. 10 shows the output
distributions of the k-NN and SVM algorithms as a function of
the ampliﬁers. As seen in Fig. 10, even if the distance between
the key fob and vehicle is larger than the maximum distance of
a single-band relay attack, the normalized output distance/score
is much closer to the legitimate case. Nevertheless, the k-NN
and SVM algorithms both output an FPR of 0% and FNR of
0% at thresholds (ΓP KES) of 4 and 5, respectively. Therefore,
HODOR is still able to effectively detect ampliﬁcation attacks.
2) Digital relay attacks: To simulate a digital relay attack,
we extracted binary information from the ACK signal
in
Fig. 1a. Then, attack signals were injected according to the
modulation scheme of the target PKES system using SDR
devices. The ACK signal of each key fob contains unique,
but static binary information. When the vehicle receives the
ACK signal, a number of ECUs are activated to transmit the
CAN packets. This standby function is implemented in modern
vehicles for enhanced driver convenience [28]. Based on this
observation, and by checking the in-vehicle network (i.e., CAN
bus), we conﬁrmed that the vehicle accepts the attack signal. In
addition to the SDR devices, we further extended the capability
of the digital relay adversary. The strongest adversary would, in
theory, be one with access to identical electronic components
as the target key fob. In practice, though, the assumption
that the digital relay adversary would have the exact same
electronic components might be perceived as overly cautious.
However, we also evaluated HODOR against this well-equipped,
but highly unlikely, hypothetical super adversary. For the Kia
Soul, one key fob out of three used in the experiment was

predicted challenge into the key fob and record the response
signals. Then, the adversary goes back to the vehicle and
plays back the valid response signals and unlocks the door.
SDR devices (i.e., HackRF One and USRP) are employed
to transmit the sampled signals. Fig. 13 shows the output
distributions of k-NN and SVM algorithms as a function of
SDR devices used in the simulation of playback attacks on
the Soul, when the #1 key fob was used as a training set.
Table IV shows the mean and standard deviation of output
distribution according to the vehicle and key fob. The k-NN
and SVM algorithms output an average FPR of 0% and average
FPR of 0.35% with an FNR of 0% at thresholds of 4 and 5,
respectively, in the Soul. In the case of the Tiguan, the k-NN
and SVM algorithms both output an average FPR of 0% with
an FNR of 0% at the threshold of 70. For the SVM algorithm,
it is clear that the average output distribution of the #1 SDR
device and #2 SDR is closer to the legitimate device than to
that of a digital relay attack. From these results, we understand
that when the transmission is given a sampled signal (i.e.,
playback attack) it achieves a closer output distribution to the
legitimate key fob than to when the transmission is given a
binary code (i.e., digital relay attack). Nevertheless, HODOR
still properly detects playback attacks.
E. Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) Conditions
To show that the features used for the PKES system are
robust under an NLoS condition, we sampled UHF-band RF
signals from the key fobs placed in a pocket or backpack. In
the PKES system, a car owner is able to unlock doors without
physically producing the key fob from its storage location. The
classiﬁer was trained with the UHF-band RF signals sampled
under an LoS condition. Fig. 14 shows the output distributions
of the k-NN and SVM algorithms as a function of where the
key fob is placed. When the key fob is placed in a backpack,
the k-NN and SVM algorithms output an FPR of 1.32% and
1.35% with an FNR of 0%. When the key fob is placed in a
pocket, the k-NN and SVM algorithms output an FPR of 1.71%
and 1.67% with an FNR of 0%. Like in previous experiments,
thresholds (ΓP KES) were respectively assigned to 4 and 5 for
each algorithm. From these results, we conclude that HODOR

system
chosen as legitimate. The remaining two key fobs and two
SDR devices were used to simulate malicious UHF-band RF
packets. For example, if the #1 key fob were to be chosen as
legitimate, features from the other key fobs would be assumed
as an attack. For the Volkswagen Tiguan, one key fob out
of the two was chosen as legitimate and the remaining key
fob and two SDR devices were used to simulate an attack.
Fig. 11 shows the experimental setup for a digital relay attack
simulation. HackRF One was used for signal acquisition, and
the USRP and another HackRF One was used for signal
injection. All of these SDR devices were controlled by a
laptop. The UHF-band RF signals corresponding to the packets
were then sampled and analyzed by HODOR. Fig. 12 shows the
output distributions of k-NN and SVM algorithms as a function
of devices used in the simulation of digital relay attacks on the
Kia Soul, when the #1 key fob was used as a training set. As
shown in Fig. 12, Table II, and Table III, the output from the
remaining remote key fobs is closer to that of a legitimate one
than to the output from the SDR devices. Especially, features
from the #3 key fob of the Soul are closer to that of the #1
key fob than to other devices. This is because the two key fobs
were manufactured in the same year and month. In the case of
the Soul, the k-NN and SVM algorithms output produced an
average FPR of 0.65% and an average FPR of 0.27% with an
FNR of 0% at thresholds (ΓP KES) of 4 and 5, respectively.
In the case of the Tiguan, the k-NN and SVM algorithms
both output an average FPR of 0% with an FNR of 0% at a
threshold (ΓP KES) of 70 for both. In addition, as mentioned
in Section III-B, a cryptographic attack can also be simulated
in the same way. Therefore, we also veriﬁed that HODOR
can effectively detect a cryptographic attack against a PKES
system. As a result, HODOR successfully ﬁltered legitimate
and malicious requests from both the ampliﬁed and replayed
messages. Accordingly, we conclude that HODOR is able to
effectively detect dual-band relay attacks and cryptographic
attacks.
D. Playback Attack Detection
During an advanced attack, it is possible that an adversary
might attempt to playback the sampled signals whose features
most closely resemble the target key fob. This type of attack
is a potential threat in PKES systems. For example, an the
attack could be mounted when an adversary predicted the next
challenge messages through an analysis of several previous
challenge messages [21]. The adversary can inject such a
