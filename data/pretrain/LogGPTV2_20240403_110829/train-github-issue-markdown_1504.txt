I require a `Hibernate SessionInViewInterceptor` that can be utilized with Spring AOP `ProxyFactoryBean`. The existing interceptors found in `org.springframework.orm.hibernate.support` are specifically designed for web-tier applications (e.g., servlet filters or the Spring Web framework). However, I need a version that is not tied to the web tier, as I intend to use it within my EJB tier. This requirement stems from the need to support multiple schemas in Hibernate.

For a more detailed understanding of the problem, please refer to the aforementioned forum thread.

As a temporary solution, I have adapted the code from `org.springframework.orm.hibernate.support.OpenSessionInViewFilter`, removing the web-specific components. I have attached the source file I am currently using, along with the relevant portion of my Spring XML configuration:

```xml
<bean id="saldoOversigtDAO2" class="com.bmd.selfserviceejb.dao.SaldoOversigtDAO2">
    <interceptor ref="hibernateSessionInViewInterceptor"/>
</bean>
```

**Affects Version: 1.1.2**
