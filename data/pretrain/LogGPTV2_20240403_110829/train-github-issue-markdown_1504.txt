I need a Hibernate SessionInViewInterceptor that can be used by Spring AOP
ProxyFactoryBean.
The existing ones in org.springframework.orm.hibernate.support is tied to the
web tier = (servlet filter, or spring web framework).
I need a non web realted one that I can used in my ejb tier.  
The reason is in short to support multiple schemas for Hibernate.  
Read the forum to understand the problem more.
My workaround was to copy the code from
org.springframework.orm.hibernate.support.OpenSessionInViewFilter and remove
the web related.
I have attached the source file I am using.
And this is the relevant part from my spring .xml file
    	com.bmd.selfserviceejb.dao.SaldoOversigtDAO2
            	hibernateSessionInViewInterceptor
