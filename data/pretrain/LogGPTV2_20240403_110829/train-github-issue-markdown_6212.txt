I have not found an existing tracking issue for this feature. If there is a duplicate, please mark it as such.

This feature is essential for enabling jspm support in Babel CLI. Specifically, we would like to use dynamic `import()` statements to directly reference plugins, which would require some form of promise support within the configuration.

Currently, when using an asynchronous configuration, the following error is encountered:
```
Error: You appear to be using an asynchronous configuration, which your current version of Babel does not support. We may add support for this in the future, but if you are on the most recent version of @babel/core and still seeing this error, you will need to synchronously return your configuration.
```

Similarly, when using an asynchronous plugin, the following error is displayed:
```
You appear to be using an asynchronous plugin, which your current version of Babel does not support. If you are using a published plugin, you may need to upgrade your @babel/core version.
```

Support for either or both of these features would be highly beneficial. Additionally, supporting asynchronous plugins would align with the upcoming top-level `await` workflows. I am open to further discussion on this matter.
