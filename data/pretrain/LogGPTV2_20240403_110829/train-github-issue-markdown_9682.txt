One of the nice features of the simple query parser is that it is possible to
only enable certain operators. It allows to do quite interesting things.
For example, if you are using the keyword analyzer and disable the whitespace
operator, `the fox | jumped over` would be parsed into `the fox` OR `jumped
over` (`the fox` would actually be treated as a single token).
One could also prevent users from running too expensive queries that could
kill the cluster such as prefix queries.
