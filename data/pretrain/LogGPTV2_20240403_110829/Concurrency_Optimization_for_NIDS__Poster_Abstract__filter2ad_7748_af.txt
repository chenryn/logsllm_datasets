### Study Design
The study involved 777 pairs of prostate cancer cases and their matched controls (n = 1554) recruited from the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study Cohort (NSHDC). Metabolites were quantified using targeted mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics in fasting plasma samples. The association with disease risk was examined using conditional logistic regression, conditioned on matching factors (BMI, age, and sample storage time), followed by correction for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were also conducted after restricting to non-aggressive and aggressive cases and stratifying by baseline age.

### Key Findings
After correcting for multiple testing, a positive association was identified between overall disease risk and plasma levels of two lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC C17:0 and LPC C18:0). These associations were more pronounced in older subjects (≥60 years), with the association for LPC C17:0 remaining significant even after Bonferroni correction. For younger subjects (40 and 50 years), glycine levels positively and pyruvate levels negatively associated with the risk of overall disease. Additionally, a positive association was found between aggressive disease risk and plasma levels of six glycerophospholipids, while acylcarnitine C18:2 levels displayed a negative association. Notably, individuals in the top quartile of LPC C17:0 levels had a 3.9-fold higher odds of developing aggressive disease in older individuals.

### The Metabolome of BMI: A Consortium of Metabolomics Studies (COMETS) Meta-analysis of 85,000 Adults
**Presenting Author:** Rachel Kelly, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Steven Moore, Krista Zanetti, Ella Temprosa, Ewy Mathe, Jessica Lasky-Su

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics is well-suited to explore the drivers and consequences of body mass index (BMI) at both mechanistic and metabolic levels. This presentation details the largest meta-analysis to date, exploring the metabolome of BMI in over 85,000 adults from 34 cohorts worldwide, within the context of the Consortium of Metabolomics Studies (COMETS). Of the 436 plasma metabolites that could be harmonized across at least ten cohorts, a random-effects meta-analysis identified 186 (47.2%) as significantly associated with BMI after adjusting for gender, age, race, and applying Bonferroni correction. Of these, 123 metabolites increased with increasing BMI, including valine (p=2.4x10^-78), tyrosine (p=6.8x10^-74), and lactate (p=8.7x10^-55) among the top hits. The remaining 63 metabolites, including cortisol (p=1.3x10^-63) and glutamate (p=3.0x10^-47), decreased. These results were largely unchanged with additional adjustment for fasting status, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes status. However, several other BMI-associated metabolites demonstrated significant heterogeneity across the cohorts, primarily driven by sex and fasting status.

### METABOseek: Supercharging Comparative Metabolomics
**Presenting Author:** Maximilian Helf, Cornell University / Boyce Thompson Institute, United States  
**Co-Author:** Frank C. Schroeder

**Abstract:**
Comparative analysis of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data is crucial for understanding living systems, including metabolic networks and small molecule biosynthetic routes. However, data processing remains a productivity bottleneck, hindering the widespread adoption of comparative metabolomics as a routine tool. To address this, we developed METABOseek, an R/shiny-based, discovery-oriented platform for extracting differential features from HPLC-HRMS data. Integrated analyses include xcms-based feature detection, statistical analysis, prediction of molecular formulas, annotation of MS2 spectra, MS2 molecular networking, and chemical compound database searches. By making metabolomics tools more accessible, METABOseek enables high-throughput identification of differential molecular features and facilitates structure elucidation of novel compounds. METABOseek also serves as a launch pad for innovative data analysis strategies developed by the metabolomics community. Many new software tools lack graphical user interfaces, requiring users to write scripts, which can create a disconnect between available tools and potential users. The open-source, modular architecture of METABOseek allows developers to integrate script-based analysis tools into its graphical user interface with minimal effort. METABOseek is available for download and as an online preview version at [https://metaboseek.com](https://metaboseek.com).

### Ion Mobility – Mass Spectrometry Based Multi-Dimensional Metabolite Annotation
**Presenting Author:** Zhiwei Zhou, Institute of Research on Cancer and Biomolecules, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China  
**Co-Author:** Zhengjiang Zhu

**Abstract:**
Unambiguous identification of metabolites is a long-standing challenge in untargeted metabolomics. Ion mobility – mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has shown great potential due to its excellent separation and metabolite annotation capabilities. Although collision cross-section (CCS) values derived from IM-MS have been widely used to improve metabolite annotation, there is a lack of effective and universal ways to integrate CCS values with other descriptors (e.g., MS/MS spectra) for confident annotation. To address this, we present a strategy to integrate CCS values with in-silico MS/MS spectra for accurate metabolite annotation. We first optimized the CCS value prediction algorithm with a large and complex training set (containing ~2000 CCS values), expanding the coverage for prediction and enabling large-scale CCS value generation. These predicted CCS values were integrated with in-silico MS/MS spectra (generated by CFM-ID) to perform confident metabolite annotation. This strategy effectively reduced false candidates by ~30-40% for different database matches (e.g., KEGG, MINE) and improved the rank of correct metabolites compared to using only in-silico MS/MS spectra. We also demonstrate the discrimination power of integrating CCS and MS/MS spectra at the whole metabolome level. In conclusion, integrating multi-dimensional properties (i.e., m/z, CCS, and MS/MS spectrum) effectively promotes metabolite annotation.

### Recommending Substructures for Unknown Tandem Mass Spectra

**Abstract:**
Structural elucidation of unknown metabolites from LC-MS/MS spectra remains challenging. However, these metabolites may share common substructures, resulting in common spectral features (product ions and mass differences). Through molecular networking (GNPS) and mass motif analysis (MS2LDA), an increasing number of spectral patterns have been discovered in high-quality spectral libraries. The lack of automated structure annotation systems hinders the utility of these patterns for partial identification of unknown metabolites and further biological interpretation. We present a method to mine patterns containing both spectral features and substructures from spectral libraries. These patterns are represented as "rules" that associate a substructure with single or several spectral features. Most rules exhibit high sensitivity for substructure prediction, with error-free theoretical masses and mass differences, and minimized non-informative substructures. From the GNPS spectral library, we generated 8378 rules associating spectral features with 712 substructures, thus recommending substructures in an automated fashion. We validated these rules on expert-annotated spectral patterns (MS2LDA motifs) and independent test spectra from the CASMI challenge, showing good agreement with ground-truth. Using non-targeted MS/MS data of yeast, we implemented a systems biology approach to cluster metabolites sharing substructures, revealing substructure enrichment in two yeast phenotypes. Our goal is to achieve systems biology interpretation of massive MS/MS data without identifying every metabolite. Our substructure recommendation system is available as an openly-accessible web-tool at [http://messar.biodatamining.be](http://messar.biodatamining.be).
