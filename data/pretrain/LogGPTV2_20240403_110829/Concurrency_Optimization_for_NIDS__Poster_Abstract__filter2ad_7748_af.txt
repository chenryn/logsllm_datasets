study design ie 777 pairs of prostate cancer cases and their matched controls (n = 1554) recruited from Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study 
Cohort (NSHDC) Metabolites were quantified with targeted MS and NMR-based metabolomics in fasting plasma samples Association to disease risk was 
examined using conditional logistic regression conditioned on matching factors (BMI, age and sample storage time), followed with correcting for multiple 
testing Statistical analyses were also done after restriction to non-aggressive and aggressive cases and stratification by baseline age After correction for 
multiple testing, we identified a positive association between overall disease risk and plasma levels of two lysophosphatidylcholines (ie, LPC C17:0 and 
LPC C18:0) The associations were more pronounced in older subjects (60 years), where the association for LPC C17:0 was significant even after Bonferroni 
correction For younger subjects (40 and 50 years), glycine levels positively, and pyruvate levels negatively, associated with risk of overall disease We 
also identified positive association between aggressive disease risk and plasma levels of six glycerophospholipids, whereas levels of acylcarnitine C18:2 
displayed a negative association A strong association was found for LPC 17:0 and aggressive disease in older individuals, where individuals in the top 
quartile had a 39 fold higher odds of developing aggressive disease

The Metabolome of BMI: A COnsortium of METabolomics Studies (COMETS) Meta-analysis of 85,000 adults
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rachel Kelly, HMS and BWH, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Steven Moore, Krista Zanetti, Ella Temprosa, Ewy Mathe, Jessica Lasky-Su
Metabolomics is ideally suited to explore the drivers and consequences of body mass index (BMI) on a mechanistic and metabolic level Here, we 
present the largest meta-analysis to date exploring the metabolome of BMI including >85,000 adults from 34 cohorts worldwide; within the context of the 
COnsortium of METabolomics Studies (COMETS) Of 436 plasma metabolites which could be harmonized across at least ten cohorts; a random-effects 
meta-analysis identified 186 (472%) metabolites as significantly associated with BMI after adjustment for gender, age, race and Bonferroni correction 
Of these, 123 increased with increasing BMI, including valine (p=24x10-78); tyrosine (p=68x10-74) and lactate (p=87x10-55); among the top hits The 
remaining 63, including cortisol (p=13x10-63); and glutamate (p=30x10-47) decreased  These results were largely unchanged with additional adjustment 
for fasting-status, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes status However, several other BMI-associated metabolites demonstrated significant 
heterogeneity across the cohorts that was primarily driven by sex and fasting-status A sub-study of 2000 children (500,000 spectra of >25,000 compounds from different HR MS/MS spectral libraries We classified these compounds into >1,000 metabolite 
families based on the ChemOnt chemical taxonomy (Feunang et al 2016) For hundreds of metabolite families we extracted characteristic MS/MS 
fragmentation patterns and built a library of predictive classifiers Using MetFamily we demonstrate the application of mFam to predict metabolite families 
in untargeted metabolomics experiments with promising results (Treutler et al 2016) Since important metabolite families such as sesquiterpene lactones 
are still sparsely populated in available spectral libraries the predictivity of those classifiers can be limited We launched the mFam initiative to broaden the 
coverage of those metabolite families By now we jointly collected >6,000 HR MS/MS spectra including spectra for ~100 sesquiterpene lactones These 
spectra will be added to MassBank in due course and we welcome further contributions

Supercharging Comparative Metabolomics with METABOseek
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Maximilian Helf, Cornell University / Boyce Thompson Institute, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Frank C. Schroeder
Comparative analysis of high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data plays a central role for our understanding of living systems, including elucidation 
of metabolic networks and small molecule biosynthetic routes However, data processing is presenting a productivity bottleneck, preventing widespread 
adoption of comparative metabolomics as a routine tool to complement transcriptomics To break this barrier, we developed METABOseek, an R/shiny-
based, discovery-oriented platform to extract differential features from HPLC-HRMS data Integrated analyses include xcms-based feature detection, 
statistical analysis, prediction of molecular formulas, annotation of MS2 spectra, MS2 molecular networking and chemical compound database searches 
By making metabolomics tools more accessible, METABOseek enables high-throughput identification of differential molecular features and facilitates 
structure elucidation of novel compounds, addressing an urgent need to explore the vast universe of unknown compounds revealed by HPLC-HRMS 
METABOseek also serves as a launch pad for innovative data analysis strategies developed by the metabolomics community Many new software tools 
do not include a graphical user interface and require users to write scripts for their data analysis This generates a growing disconnect between the 
available data analysis tools and their potential user base: getting to know the functions and data standards used in a tool takes time and keeps users 
from integrating them into their workflows, especially when programming experience is limited The open-source, modular architecture of METABOseek 
allows developers to dramatically expand their audience by integrating script-based analysis tools into its graphical user interface with minimal effort 
METABOseek is available for download and as an online preview version at https://metaboseekcom

Ion mobility – mass spectrometry based multi-dimensional metabolite annotation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Zhiwei Zhou, IRCBC, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China
CO-AUTHORS: Zhengjiang Zhu
Unambiguous identification of metabolites is the long-standing challenge for untargeted metabolomics Ion mobility – mass spectrometry (IM-MS) shows 
great potential for metabolomics application due to its excellent capability for both separation and metabolite annotation Although the collision cross 
section (CCS) value derived from IM-MS has been widely proved to improve the metabolite annotation, it still lacks effective and universal ways to integrate 
CCS values with other available descriptors (eg MS/MS spectra) to provide confident metabolite annotation To address this challenge, we present the first 
strategy to integrate CCS values with in-silico MS/MS spectra to perform accurate metabolite annotation Here, we first optimized the CCS value prediction 
algorithm with a large and complex training set (containing ~2000 CCS values) It significantly expanded the applicable coverage for prediction, and 
enabled to generate large-scale CCS values for metabolites These predicted CCS values were further integrated with in-silico MS/MS spectra (generated 
by CFM-ID) to perform confident metabolite annotation Comparing with using exact mass match, this strategy was validated to effectively reduce ~30-
40% false candidates for different database match (eg KEGG, MINE) using several benchmark datasets It also supported to improve the rank of correct 
metabolite comparing with directly using in-silico MS/MS spectra In addition, we would demonstrate the discrimination power of integrating CCS and MS/
MS spectra in the whole metabolome level In conclusion, the strategy of integrating multi-dimensional properties (ie m/z CCS and MS/MS spectrum) 
effectively promoted metabolite annotation

Recommending substructures for unknown tandem mass spectra

Structural elucidation of unknown metabolites from LC-MS/MS spectra remains a challenging task However, these metabolites may share common 
substructures, which may result in common spectral features (product ions and mass differences) Through molecular networking (GNPS) and mass 
motif analysis (MS2LDA), an increasing number of spectral patterns have been discovered in high-quality spectral libraries However, the lack of 
automated structure annotation system prevents these patterns from being useful for partial identification of unknown metabolites and further 
biological interpretation We present a method that mine patterns containing both spectral features and substructures from spectral libraries These 
novel patterns are represented as “rules” that associate a substructure with single or several spectral features Most rules represent high sensitivity 
for substructure prediction, and they have two important characteristics: i) Spectral features are error-free theoretical masses and mass difference; ii) 
Predicted substructures are maximum common substructures (MCSs) between biological molecules – non-informative substructures are minimized 
From GNPS spectral library, we generated 8378 rules that associate spectral features to 712 substructures, thus recommending substructures in an 
automated fashion We validated GNPS rules on both expert-annotated spectral patterns (MS2LDA motifs) and independent test spectra from CASMI 
challenge, both showing a good agreement with the ground-truth Using non-targeted MS/MS data of yeast, we implemented a system biology 
approach that clusters metabolites sharing substructure, revealing substructure enrichment in two yeast phenotypes Our goal is to achieve system 
biology interpretation of massive MS/MS data without identifying every metabolite Our substructure recommendation system was developed into an 
openly-available web-tool at messarbiodataminingbe
