values (cut points of the 99th percentile) for original
BIND and MaxFetch(1) are 1,414ms and 1,382ms re-
spectively. Similarly, Figure 11 shows the 99th percentile
distribution for Data-set B.
Figure 12 presents the latency diﬀerences per domain
request (between original BIND and MaxFetch(1)) in
the top domains dataset. Here, for each request for do-

main d we calculate Ld
orig is the
latency of the query for d using original BIND, and
m1f when using MaxFetch(1). Figure 12 shows the
Ld

5000), where positive values represent domain requests
for which MaxFetch(1) performed faster.
6 The Pervasiveness of Out-of-Bailiwick
Nameservers
Here we measure the prevalence of domains with out-of-
bailiwick name servers. We show that the majority of the
domains out of the top 1M popular sites [21] have out-
of-bailiwick name servers. We performed two controlled
experiments to monitor the resolvers’ operation and to
examine the NS referral responses in the resolutions of
these domains.
In the ﬁrst controlled experiment we measured how

MaxFetch(1) latency per domain histogram.
100K websites dataset: OrigBIND –
many recursive resolutions a BIND based resolver per-
formed when resolving each of the top 1M domains. The
cache was cleared before issuing each client request. In
an attempt to capture the diﬀerence between the number
of resolutions performed per client request in practice vs.
theory (as in Section 2 Figure 1 versus Figure 2). That
is, at each level of the hierarchy one resolution is not
counted. Figure 13 shows the cumulative distribution
of domains that trigger additional resolutions (fetches).
The ﬁgure shows that 60.22% of the domain requests
