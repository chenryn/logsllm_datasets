Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

In my code, I have the following structure:
```html
<test>
  Hello, World!
</test>
```
This works in Plunker, but it does not function correctly in my actual project. The `v-if` directive only seems to work when wrapped in a `div` element, as shown in this example:
```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <test>
    Hello, World!
  </test>
</div>
```
However, adding the `.wrapper` div disrupts my layout.
