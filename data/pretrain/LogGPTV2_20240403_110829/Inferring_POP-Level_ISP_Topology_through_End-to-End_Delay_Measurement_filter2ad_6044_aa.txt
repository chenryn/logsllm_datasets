Abstract. In this paper, we propose a new topology inference technique
that aims to reveals how ISPs deploy their layer two and three networks
at the POP level, without relying on ISP core network information such
as router hops and domain names. This is because, even though most
of previous works in this ﬁeld leverage core network information to infer
ISP topologies, some of our measured ISPs ﬁlter ICMP packets and do
not allow us to access core network information through traceroute. And,
several researchers point out that such information is not always reliable.
So, to infer ISP core network topology without relying on ISP releasing
information, we deploy systems to measure end-to-end communication
delay between residential users, and map the collected delay and cor-
responding POP-by-POP paths. In our inference process, we introduce
assumptions about how ISPs tend to deploy their layer one and two
networks. To validate our methodology, we measure end-to-end commu-
nication delay of four nationwide ISPs between thirteen diﬀerent cities
in Japan and infer their POP-level topologies.
Keywords: End-to-end measurement, network tomography, communi-
cation delay, Japanese Internet.
1 Introduction
When inferring ISP topologies and identifying locations of their network elements
(such as routers), researchers often rely on ISP core network information, such
as the domain names of the router interfaces. Indeed many previous works (e.g.,
[1,2]) rely on ISP core network information to infer ISP topologies or identify
network element locations, but we observe that some of measured Japanese ISPs
ﬁlter ICMP packets, therefore we cannot even have access to their core network
information. And also, Zhang et al. points out that the domain names some-
times do not represent accurate geographical locations of network elements[3].

Moreover, ISPs sometimes outsource designs and deployments of their layer two
networks, and therefore, they do not even know where their layer two links are
laid down.
In this paper, we propose a new topology inference technique that aims to
reveal how ISPs deploy their layer two and three networks at the POP (Point
Of Presence) level, without relying on ISP core network information. To in-
fer such topological properties of ISP networks, we deploy systems to measure
communication delay between residential users and map the collected delay and
corresponding geographical POP-level paths. Our approach is based on an as-
sumption that communication delay between users closely depends on the length
of their communication path over optical ﬁbers or copper cables. Even though
it is true that a transmission delay in an access network is relatively large due
to its lower speed, we could eliminate the factor under some circumstances (de-
scribed in Sec. 2). By eliminating access delays, we try to map core network
delays, which are derived from end-to-end delays and access delays, and their
corresponding POP-level paths.
Since how carrier services lay their optical ﬁbers is one of the important
issues to map them in practice, we introduce Japan speciﬁc circumstances that
major carrier services (e.g., KDDI1 and SBTM2) were established as part of
other infrastructure services such as railroads or expressways and optical ﬁbers
are presumably laid along those infrastructures. Through leveraging distances
derived from those infrastructures, we try to map the core network delays and
corresponding geographical paths. The result reveals that the Japanese Internet
has the following two characteristics: 1)Some of the measured ISPs have hub-
and-spoke topologies where hubs are the most populated cities in Japan such as
Tokyo and Osaka; 2)All of the ISPs exchange their customer traﬃc at the cities.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy describe
our inference methodology. Section 3 shows our measurement environment and
approach, in practice. In Section 4, we classify Japanese ISPs and infer POP-
level ISP topologies based on a classiﬁcation. We then present related works in
Section 5 and ﬁnally summarize the discussion of this paper in Section 6.
2 Inference Methodology
Since our motivation of this work is to explore where ISPs deploy their POPs
and how POPs are connected with each other, through end-to-end delay mea-
surements, we brieﬂy describe a communication path between residential users.
When residential users communicate with each other, communication paths be-
tween them consist of both access (layer two) and ISP core (layer three) networks.
Therefore, an end-to-end communication delay between residential users can be
described as below.
delay(src, dst) = adsrc + addst + CD(src, dst) + Esrc,dst

Here, src and dst are nodes connected to the Internet, and communicate with
each other; delay(src, dst) denotes an end-to-end communication delay between
src and dst; adsrc is the access delay at src and CD(src, dst) is the delay of
ISP core networks between src and dst; Esrc,dst is the measurement error of the
delay.
If Internet access services are served by LECs (Local Exchange Carriers),
especially in case that LECs provide DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) services, a
detailed communication path can be described as follows: (1) measurement node
↔ BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server) that aggregate user sessions from
the Internet access services; (2) BRAS ↔ ISP CE (Customer’s Edge) router
that is located in the closest POP to users; (3) ISP core network (shown in
Fig. 1). Although all the customer sessions are aggregated at BRAS not de-
pending on which ISP users connect to, each ISP’s CE routers can be deployed
anywhere based on ISP policies. ISPs that serve the access services by them-
selves (e.g., CATVs) also deploy CE routers, which are the same as customers’
default routers. So, through measuring the end-to-end communication delay and
the access delays individually, we are able to derive the core delay from (1).

To explore where ISPs deploy their POPs and how they are connected with
each other, we need to map the core delay and corresponding POP-level paths.
If we are able to select candidate POP locations and links among them, (1) can
be transcribed into the following set of simultaneous equations.
delay(src, dst) = adsrc + addst +
xp,q × cdp,q + Esrc,dst
(2)
(cid:2)
p,q∈N
Here, N denotes a set of candidate POP locations of a measured ISP; p and q
satisfy {p, q | p, q ∈ N}; cdp,q denotes a core delay between p and q; xp,q = 1 if
a direct path between p and q exists and the path is used to connect between
src and dst, otherwise xp,q = 0. delay(src, dst), adsrc and addst are measur-
able through end-to-end measurements and cdp,q can be derived leveraging the
distance between p and q.
In the equation, xp,q × cdp,q denotes the path between p and q. Since the
maximum number of path patterns is almost 2|N|2 where |N| is the number
of POPs, we must reduce complexities under the practical conditions of the
real world. We are able to shrink the possible path patterns with the major
38

restriction that is operations and management (OAM) cost as follows: 1) Link
cost: Traﬃc aggregation cuts both layer one and two cost because of getting
shorter optical ﬁbers; 2) Node cost: Aggregating layer three elements (routers)
reduces the maintenance costs. We will show the possible patterns in Japan
according to the restriction above in Sec.4.2, which make (2) solvable.
Moreover, since it is hard to have access to layer one and two network infor-
mation in general, we introduce an assumption that those networks are usually
deployed along other infrastructure services, e.g. railroads and expressways, as
we described in Sec. 1.
3 Measurement Environment
For a nationwide delay measurement in Japan, we deploy thirteen measurement
nodes in diﬀerent cities. Some of the selected cities are the most populated cities
in Japan (e.g., Tokyo and Osaka), and we also choose cities that are junctions of
railroads and expressways and possibly the POP locations in Japan. Each node
connects to four nationwide ISPs (ISP X, Y, Z and W) through “NTT Flet’s
Service” that is a nationwide layer two network service for connecting end users
to their ISPs via PPPoE over optical ﬁbers.
We implement a measurement system to measure the communication delay
between IP addresses attached to measurement nodes. Each node runs measure-
ment UNIX daemons bound to four PPPoE interfaces, respectively, and each
daemon measures the communication delay between the IP address and IP ad-
dresses attached to other measurement nodes. The daemon uses Linux raw socket
and libpcap3 for both sending and receiving measurement packets. The commu-
nication delay is measured by an echo request/reply method using 64-byte UDP
packets. In order to minimize the queuing delay caused by network congestion,
the daemon sends three train packets to each destination every ten seconds and
only retains the minimum delay of them[4].
To measure the access delay, the daemon generates and send a special packet
whose source and destination IP addresses are the IP address bound to the
PPPoE interface. The delay measured in this manner directly corresponds to
the access delay in Sec.2.
4 ISP Topology Inference
In this section, we apply our methodology to the Japanese Internet and infer
POP-level ISP topologies with measured delay data. We introduce some precon-
ditions to make our inference more accurate: 1)The velocity of light in an optical
ﬁber becomes 60-70% compared to it in vacuum[5]. So, the velocity of light in an
optical ﬁber cable becomes C(cid:4) = 2/3× C[km/sec]; 2) There is some overhead to
process the measurement packets, since we use PPPoE sessions to connect ISPs
and libpcap for capturing the packets. And, there also exist queuing delays when

the packets go through network elements such as layer two switches, layer three
routers and BRAS. we deﬁne queueing delay(qd) caused by network elements as
> 1[msec] (this value is derived from our preliminary experiments).
4.1 Analysis of Access Delay
Figure 2 shows the minimum access delays of measured cities and ISPs in January
2008. As it shows, the access delay trends of the ISP X, Y and W are relatively
similar, while the trend of the ISP Z is quite diﬀerent from them. This indicates
that ISP CE routers of the ISP X, Y and W are located in the almost same places.
And, most of the access delays connecting to the ISPs are around 1[msec], we
can estimate that CE routers of these ISPs are located in the same prefecture
where measurement nodes are located. On the other hand, most cities except
Tokyo and Osaka in the ISP Z network has long access delays that are more than
5[msec], and this implies that the ISP Z does not deploy its CE router in each
prefecture. Since the access delays of the ISP Z at Tokyo and Osaka are almost
the same values of the other ISPs’, we can estimate that the ISP Z deploys its
POP at Tokyo and Osaka, at least.
