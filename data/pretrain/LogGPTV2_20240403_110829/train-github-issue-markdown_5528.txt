It's noted on the docs pages at https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html
react-dom currently disables/mutates the global console in strict mode.
This seems to be an intentional feature/bug that's an unnecessary
inconvenience.
React version: 17.0.1
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. Use react-dom in strict mode
  2. Try to log something
## The current behavior
logging is disabled in strict-mode
## The expected behavior
Possible better solutions:
  * Make it more obvious that the console is being mutated/disabled
  * Use a proxy
