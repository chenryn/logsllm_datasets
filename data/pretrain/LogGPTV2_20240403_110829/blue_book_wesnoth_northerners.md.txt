The [Northerners](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Northerners) are a faction comprising Orcs and their allies, who inhabit the northern regions of the Great Continent. This faction includes warrior Orcs, enslaved Goblins, Trolls who are often manipulated into combat by the Orcs, and the serpentine Naga.

The Northerners excel in gameplay by leveraging their numerous low-cost, high-health-point (HP) soldiers. This strategy allows them to field a large and resilient force, making them a formidable presence on the battlefield.
