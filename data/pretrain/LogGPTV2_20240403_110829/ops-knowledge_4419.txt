User: Tried installing gevent using pip install gevent and also tried compiling from source. Both the times the installation stopped because of the following error.
/usr/local/include/evhttp.h:223: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘ev_int64_t’
i have libevent installed in /usr/local/lib and its being picked up during installation. Any help would be highly appreciated.

Assistant: I encountered this error as well. I believe it is due to a conflict between libev and libevent (in my case, libev-4.11 and libevent-1.4.14b). libev replaces /usr/local/include/event.h and /usr/local/include/evutil.h with its own version of those files, and trying to compile gevent with the versions from libev results in the error:
/usr/local/include/evhttp.h:223: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘ev_int64_t’
After removing libev and reinstalling libevent, I was able to install gevent using easy_install.
