User: I have a Flask app that uses SQLAlchemy (Flask-SQLAlchemy) and Alembic (Flask-Migrate).  The app runs on Google App Engine. I want to use Google Cloud SQL.
On my machine, I run python manage.py db upgrade to run my migrations against my local database.  Since GAE does not allow arbitrary shell commands to be run, how do I run the migrations on it?
Assistant: You can whitelist the ip of your local machine for the Google Cloud SQL instance, then you run the script on your local machine.
