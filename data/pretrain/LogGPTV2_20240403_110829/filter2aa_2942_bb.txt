### Scenario 1: Malicious Employee Inserting Malware

#### Description
A disgruntled employee of an integrator company inserts malicious functionality into traffic navigation software and subsequently leaves the ABC Company.

#### Existing Practices
- **Integrator:** Peer-review process
- **Acquirer:** Contract specifying time, cost, and functionality requirements

#### Reference
NIST SP 800-161r1: *Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations*
- [Free Download](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1)

#### Threat Event
- **Outcome:** 50 large metropolitan areas and 500 instances affected by malware. When activated, the malware causes major disruptions to traffic.
- **Affected Units:** Traffic Navigation System, Implementation Company, Legal, Public Affairs

#### Risk Assessment
- **Impact:** High – Traffic disruptions are major and last for two weeks while a workaround is created. Malicious code remains undetected and poses a continuing vulnerability.
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Risk Exposure (Impact x Likelihood):** High

#### Acceptable Level of Risk
- **Moderate**

#### Mitigation
- **Potential Mitigating Strategies and C-SCRM Controls:**
  - C-SCRM_AC-1
  - C-SCRM_AC-2
  - C-SCRM_CM-3
  - C-SCRM_IR-2
  - C-SCRM_SA-10
  - C-SCRM_SA-11
- **Estimated Cost of Mitigating Strategies:** $2.5 million
- **Change in Likelihood:** High to Low
- **Change in Impact:** No change
- **Selected Strategies:** Combination of strategies using the mitigation noted
- **Estimated Residual Risk:** Moderate

### Scenario 2: Unintentional Compromise

#### Background
Uninformed insiders replace components with more cost-efficient solutions without understanding the implications on performance, safety, and long-term costs. ABC Company has decided to conduct a threat scenario analysis to identify mitigating practices that are applicable to a variety of projects and have significant success within a year.

#### Environment
ABC Company acquires many different systems with varying degrees of requirements. Due to the complexity, they use a scenario based on an actual past event.

#### Threat Event
- **Narrative:** Gill, a newly hired program manager, is tasked with reducing the cost of a $5 million system supporting complex research applications. The system must not experience unscheduled outages longer than 10 seconds. Gill sees that some components are priced high and asks John, a junior engineer, to replace several load balancers and routers to save costs.
- **Threat Assessment Committee Determination:** Acceptable level of risk score: 2/10

#### Threat Scenario Analysis
- **Potential Outcomes:**
  1. Modifications found inadequate before purchase (30% chance, no impact)
  2. Modifications found inadequate during testing (40% chance, low impact)
  3. Inadequacy undetected, leading to denial-of-service incidents (30% chance, high impact)

#### Mitigating Strategies
- **Strategies Identified:**
  - Improve existing training program and add configuration management controls [Ref. AT-1, CM-1]
  - Improve testing requirements [Ref. SA-11]
  - Require redundancy and heterogeneity in system design [Ref. SC-29, SC-36]

- **Cost and Effectiveness:**
  - Training: $200,000 (not sufficient alone)
  - Testing: Not sufficient alone
  - Redundancy and Heterogeneity: $2 million (significant cost but effective)

- **Selected Combination:**
  - Mandatory day-long training program and configuration management controls ($80,000 initial investment)
  - $60,000 investment in testing equipment and software
  - Redundancy and diversity of design requirements as appropriate

- **Residual Risk:** Moderate

### Scenario 3: Vulnerable Reused Components Within Systems

#### Background
ABC Company reuses internally developed and open-source system components in their COTS solutions. Recent cyber attacks have exploited vulnerabilities in reused components, prompting customers to demand increased transparency.

#### Environment
ABC Company is a market leader in financial planning and analysis (FP&A) software, with customers relying on their solutions to store, process, and analyze sensitive financial information.

#### Threat Event
- **Vulnerability:** Apache Struts, a widely-used component, contains a vulnerability patched in March 2021. This vulnerability was not included in ABC Company’s updates.
- **Threat Scenario:** A well-resourced cyber-criminal organization could exploit this vulnerability to install rogue code, extract and sell sensitive financial information, causing reputational harm and legal action against ABC Company.

#### Mitigating Strategies
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Ensure developers receive training on secure development practices and use vulnerability tooling [Ref. SA-15]
  - Evaluate reused system components for known vulnerabilities
  - Maintain a system component inventory [Ref. CM-8]
  - Continuously monitor and remediate vulnerabilities [Ref. CA-7, RA-5]

#### Threat Event Outcome
- **Impact:** More than 10 major customers compromised, 5% drop in share price, competitors capitalizing on the attack, significant legal costs, and 5% abnormal customer churn.
- **Affected Units:** FP&A Software Products Division
- **Risk Impact:** High – $350 million in aggregate cost, substantial reputational impact, and loss of market share, share price, and customers
- **Likelihood:** High – 20% annual probability
- **Risk Exposure (Impact x Likelihood):** High – $70 million loss exposure
- **Acceptable Level of Risk:** Moderate – $20 million

#### Mitigation
- **Potential Mitigating Strategies and SCRM Controls:**
  - Ensure developers receive training on secure development practices and use vulnerability tooling
  - Evaluate reused system components for known vulnerabilities
  - Maintain a system component inventory
  - Continuously monitor and remediate vulnerabilities

- **Estimated Cost of Mitigating Strategies:** Not specified
- **Change in Impact and Likelihood:** Not specified
- **Selected Strategies:** Not specified
- **Estimated Residual Risk:** Not specified
