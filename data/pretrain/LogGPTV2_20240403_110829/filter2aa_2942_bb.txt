SCENARIO 5: Unintentional Compromise 
Background  
Uninformed insiders replace components with more cost-efficient solutions without 
understanding the implications to performance, safety, and long-term costs. 
ABC Company has concerns about its acquisition policies and has decided to conduct a threat 
scenario analysis to identify mitigating practices. Any practices selected must be applicable to a 
variety of projects and have significant success within a year.  
Environment 
ABC Company acquires many different systems with varying degrees of requirements. Because 
of the complexity of the environment, ABC Company officials decide that they should use a 
scenario based on an actual past event. 
Threat Event 
Using an actual event as a basis, the agency designs the following threat event narrative: 
Gill, a newly hired program manager, is tasked with reducing the cost of a $5 million 
system being purchased to support complex research applications in a unique physical 
environment. The system would be responsible for relaying information regarding 
temperature, humidity, and toxic chemical detection, as well as storing and analyzing 
various data sets. There must not be any unscheduled outages more than 10 seconds long, 
or serious safety concerns and the potential destruction of research will occur. ABC 
Company’s threat assessment committee determined that the acceptable level of risk for 
this type of event has a score of 2/10. 
Gill sees that a number of components in the system design are priced high compared 
with similar components he has purchased in the commercial acquisition space. Gill asks 
John, a junior engineer with the integration company, to replace several load balancers 
and routers in the system design to save costs.  
Threat Scenario Analysis 
ABC Company decides that there are three potential outcomes to the scenario: 
1. It is determined that the modifications are inadequate before any are purchased (30 % 
chance, no impact);  
2. It is determined that the modifications are inadequate during testing (40 % chance, low 
impact); or 
3. The inadequacy of the modifications is undetected, and the routers are installed in the 
system, begin to fail, and create denial-of-service incidents (30 % chance, high impact).

Mitigating Strategies 
Three potential mitigating strategies are identified:  
• Improve the existing training program [Ref. AT-1], and add configuration management 
controls to monitor all proposed changes to critical systems [Ref. CM-1]; 
• Improve the testing requirements [Ref. SA-11]; and 
• Require redundancy and heterogeneity in the design of systems [Ref. SC-29, SC-36]. 
Adding configuration management controls would increase the likelihood that the modifications 
were rejected either at the initial stage or during testing, but it was determined that a $200,000 
investment in training alone could not bring the level of risk to an acceptable level in the time 
required. 
Improving the testing requirements would increase the likelihood of the modifications being 
rejected during testing, but it was determined that no amount of testing alone could bring the 
level of risk to an acceptable level.  
Requiring redundancy and heterogeneity in the design of the system would significantly reduce 
the impact of this and other events of concern but could double the cost of a project. In this 
scenario, it was determined that an investment of $2 million would be required to bring the risk 
to an acceptable level. 
As a result of this analysis, ABC Company decides to implement a combination of practices:  
• A mandatory, day-long training program for those handling the acquisition of critical 
systems and the addition of configuration management controls that require that changes 
be approved by a configuration management board (CMB) ($80,000 initial investment), 
• $60,000 investment in testing equipment and software for critical systems and elements, 
and  
• Redundancy and diversity of design requirements, as deemed appropriate for each 
project.  
It was determined that this combination of practices would be most cost-effective for a variety of 
projects and help mitigate the risk from a variety of threats.

SCENARIO 6: Vulnerable Reused Components Within Systems 
Background  
As part of their standard development practices, ABC Company reuses internally developed and 
open source system components in the development of their COTS solutions. Recent high-profile 
cyber attacks have capitalized on vulnerabilities present in reused system components, and ABC 
Company’s customers are demanding increased transparency as a means of mitigating their own 
risk exposure.  
ABC Company has decided to perform a threat scenario analysis to determine which steps can be 
taken to improve the security of their software products and offer customers greater confidence 
that ABC Company is taking the necessary steps to protect them from these types of attacks.  
Environment 
ABC Company is a well-known market-leader in the financial planning and analysis (FP&A) 
software market. ABC Company’s customers rely on Acme’s FP&A solution to store, process, 
and analyze sensitive financial information (e.g., closing the books).  
Threat Event 
Apache Struts (a widely-used software component) is used as a component within ABC 
Company’s COTS FP&A solution. A vulnerability present in Apache Struts was patched in 
March of 2021. Motivated by financial gain, opportunistic cyber-criminal organizations sought 
opportunities to capitalize on vulnerabilities in COTS solutions.  
ABC Company provides frequent updates to mitigate software vulnerabilities in their COTS 
solutions. However, in this case, the software component in question was not included as part of 
these updates.  
The vulnerability in question is present and exploitable within ABC Company’s FP&A solution.  
Threat Scenario Analysis 
If the attackers were to discover the vulnerability in ABC Company’s product, a potential course 
of events could occur as follows:  
A well-resourced cyber-criminal organization could install rogue code in customer 
instances of the FP&A solution. Using this rogue code, the cyber criminals could extract 
and sell the sensitive, undisclosed financial information of public companies that trade on 
global stock markets. Upon discovery of the attack, ABC Company could face significant 
reputational harm due to the negative publicity. ABC Company’s customers may engage 
in legal action against ABC Company as a result of their failure to appropriately patch 
known vulnerabilities in their software products.

Mitigating Strategies 
ABC Company identified the following areas for improvement in order to enhance their secure 
software development practices and improve the confidence in their products: 
• Ensure that developers receive training on secure development practices and are 
instructed on the use of vulnerability tooling so that developed software is secure.  
• Ensure that reused system components – whether developed internally or open source – 
are evaluated as part of a standard process for known vulnerabilities (Ref. SA-15).  
• Maintain a system component inventory to aid in maintenance of the software product 
throughout its life cycle (Ref. CM-8).  
• Continuously monitor system components for vulnerabilities that arise, and ensure that 
appropriate processes are in place for expeditious remediation once a fix is available. 
Automate this process where possible (Ref. CA-7, RA-5).

Threat Event 
Description 
A cyber criminal organization exploits a known vulnerability 
in an FP&A software product to install rogue code and gain 
access to sensitive financial information contained within 
the application instances used by ABC Company customers.  
Existing Practices 
ABC Company has a comprehensive and secure SDLC that 
focuses on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities within 
their in-house developed code. ABC Company releases 
frequent patches to close vulnerabilities in their products.  
Threat Event 
Outcome 
More than 10 major ABC Company customers are 
compromised as a result of the vulnerable software. 
Negative press surrounding the attack has led to significant 
impact (i.e., 5 % drop) to ABC Company’s share price. ABC 
Company’s competitors are capitalizing on the attack and 
using their own security practices to differentiate 
themselves and gain market share. ABC Company faces 
significant legal costs due to action taken by affected 
customers. ABC Company has seen a 5 % abnormal 
customer churn in the year following the attack.
