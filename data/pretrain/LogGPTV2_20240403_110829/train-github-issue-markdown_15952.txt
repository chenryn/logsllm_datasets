According to the docs: https://github.com/atom/atom-
shell/blob/master/docs/api/screen.md you can access the primary display but
they don't mention anything about managing other screens.
Basically I want to load two BrowserWindows and tell them to appear on the
different screens (when a user has more than one screen available).
In Adobe AIR I did something like:
    var largestScreen = null;
    if(air.Screen.screens.length > 1) {
        for( index = 0; index  largestArea) {
                    largestScreen = currentScreen;
                }
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Show error that you need a projector screen
        alert('You need more than one screen to run this application.');
    }
And then I could target a window bounds for the windows.
Is it possible to achieve something similar in atom-shell?
