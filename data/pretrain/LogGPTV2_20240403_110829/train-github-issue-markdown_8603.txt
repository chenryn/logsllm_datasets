According to the documentation at [http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.27.0/tutorial/application-distribution/](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.27.0/tutorial/application-distribution/):

> "You can also package your app into an asar archive to prevent the exposure of your app's source code to users."

Despite this, after installing the application, I was able to access and view the source code within the `\resources\app.asar` directory. Furthermore, I was able to modify the source code using Notepad++ (e.g., changing "Welcome to" to "to Welcome"), and the application still functioned without any issues.
