### Data Collection and Statistical Analysis

We collected Round-Trip Time (RTT) data for 50 calls, 25 of which experienced rerouting. To determine if the two groups (rerouted and non-rerouted calls) are statistically different, we conducted a power analysis on the data. This analysis helps us ascertain whether there is a statistically significant difference between regular and attack-impacted calls. With a p-value of <0.001, we calculated a power of 1.0 and a sample size of 10 per class. Consequently, we were able to confidently reject the null hypothesis. Figure 13 illustrates the distribution curves for normal and real SS7 redirection attack-impacted calls, showing a clear distinction between the two.

### Real SS7 Rerouting Attacks vs. Emulated Attacks

The results from real SS7 rerouting attacks differ from our emulated attacks. On average, an actual SS7 rerouting attack to San Francisco added an additional second to the average legitimate call RTT. This is higher than the average time introduced by rerouting to Moscow, Tokyo, or Tel Aviv in our testbed. The increased latency in real attacks is due to additional in-network processing, such as traversing service switching points, signal transfer points, and service control points. These components add latency to the call before it reaches its true destination. Geographic and technological constraints prevent us from determining the exact time introduced by this additional hardware and audio stacks at the network level.

### Novelty and Significance

This is the first research paper to observe the effects of SS7 rerouting attacks and propose a possible end-to-end solution. Our emulation provides a conservative estimate of actual SS7 rerouting attacks in terms of RTT, thereby evaluating our system under more challenging conditions than what would be seen with actual SS7 rerouting attacks.

### Limitations

#### Detection Challenges
Under certain conditions, detection may be more difficult. If an adversary hijacks an SS7 node that is close to the path a legitimate call would take, Sonar may have difficulty detecting the attack. The RTT increase introduced by the additional distance the call audio travels will be minimal in this scenario. However, the time added by the additional audio stacks and processing at the SS7 node will remain the same. In such cases, we believe Sonar would perform similarly to how it did in our emulations. Additionally, as mentioned in Section V, Sonar requires both parties to actively participate in the protocol for rerouting detection to occur, similar to traditional distance bounding [4].

#### Network Variability
Variations in RTTs occur regularly in networks, primarily due to network traffic conditions and variations in routing paths. Extensive work has been done in the network measurement communities to characterize such variations in both traditional and cellular data networks. However, to our knowledge, a similar public longitudinal study across telephony voice networks has not been conducted. We conducted a small-scale study to determine whether measurements in this space are subject to wide variation. Figure 14 shows a box plot representing three sets of audio latency tests collected over a two-day span, confirming that very little variation was seen during our testing. We intend to conduct a more comprehensive study in future work.

### Localizing Callers

Our results showed that RTT is sufficient to determine that a call is likely rerouted but insufficient to determine the location of the other party. While our current threat model assumes mutually trusted parties, phone calls are often used among parties that may not initially trust each other [29]. Accurate location measurement would allow us to relax Sonar’s trust assumptions. Determining location is hindered by several factors, including the fact that RTT is a scalar value that can only resolve distance, not position. Accurate and reliable RTT measurements from multiple positions on the globe would be necessary to triangulate caller position, which is not possible with a single call. One possibility is for a group of mutually trusting collaborators to sequentially call a proving party to provide triangulation measurements. However, an adversary with the ability to redirect calls can choose not to delay some of the triangulation calls, significantly influencing the measurement.

### Related Work

SS7 has been known to be vulnerable to compromise for some time [31], [32]. Attack research has detailed how mobile users may be tracked [6], service may be denied [33], and how attackers can redirect calls and text messages [33], [7]. Current defenses against SS7 attacks focus mainly on network layer filtering [7], [34], [35], but these have limitations. The SnoopSnitch app [37] offers a mechanism to detect messages indicative of SS7 tracking, but it relies on capabilities provided by debug interfaces available only to a select set of mobile devices. The anticipated successor for SS7, Diameter, is also vulnerable to redirection attacks [35]. Sonar is the first system to protect any type of phone against redirection attacks in any telephone network, especially those that do not create messages during interception. It is also the first system to be tested against real SS7 rerouting attack data.

### Conclusion

SS7 redirection attacks threaten the confidentiality of all calls passing through the PSTN. While the ability to redirect calls is a legitimate feature (e.g., call forwarding), the number of parties with the ability to perform such actions without explicit authorization is now large. We designed and implemented Sonar to detect such attacks, which characteristically increase the latency of call audio when executed. Using calls in real networks and our own redirection testbed, we demonstrated the ability to detect such redirections with high accuracy—up to 97.0% (0.03% false positive rate) when they leave North America. We also executed real SS7 attacks and were able to detect them all. We believe that Sonar can easily be included in future handset hardware and represents the best means of reliably detecting such attacks in the short and medium terms.
