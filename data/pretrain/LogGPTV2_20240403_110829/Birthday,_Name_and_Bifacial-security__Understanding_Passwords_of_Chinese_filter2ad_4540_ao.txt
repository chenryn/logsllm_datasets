In contrast, popular ones in English datasets

tend to be meaningful letter strings (e.g., “sunshine”
and “letmein”). The eternal theme of love—frankly,
“iloveyou” or perhaps euphemistically, “princess”—
also show up in top-10 lists of English datasets. Our
results conﬁrm the folklore [50] that “back at the dawn of
the Web, the most popular password was 12345. Today,
it is one digit longer but hardly safer: 123456.”
It is interesting to see that only the top-10 most popular
ones account for as high as 6.78%∼10.44% of each
entire dataset, with Dodonew being the only exception.
However, this ﬁgure for Dodonew even achieves 3.24%,
while the English datasets are all below 2.80%. This
indicates that top-popular Chinese passwords are more
concentrated than their English counterparts, which is
likely to make Chinese passwords more vulnerable to
online guessing. This will be conﬁrmed in Sec. 4.1.
Top popular structures. We have seen that digits are
popular in top-10 passwords of Chinese datasets. Are
they also popular in the whole datasets? We investigate
the frequencies of password patterns that involve digits,
and show the results of the top 3 most frequent ones
in the left hand of Table 4. The ﬁrst column of the
table denotes the pattern of a password as in [58] (i.e.,
L denotes a lower-case sequence, D for digit sequence,
U for upper-case sequence, S for symbol sequence, and
the structure pattern of the password “Wanglei123” is
ULD). Over 50% of the average Chinese web passwords
