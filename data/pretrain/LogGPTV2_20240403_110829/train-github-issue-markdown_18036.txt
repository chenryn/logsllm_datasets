Numpy - 1.12.1  
Python - 2.7.13 | Anaconda 4.4.0  
OS - CentOS, MacOS
I am run the following code to produce an array using numpy
    import numpy as np
    print np.arange(0.002, 0.021, 0.001)
And get the following result
`[ 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005 0.006 0.007 0.008 0.009 0.01 0.011 0.012 0.013
0.014 0.015 0.016 0.017 0.018 0.019 0.02 0.021] `
The last entry should not be there. This is specific to values I have
mentioned here. I do not encounter this while using other values in arange.
I was able to reproduce this in the following online ipython editor website,
so I don't think this is specific to my installation.
