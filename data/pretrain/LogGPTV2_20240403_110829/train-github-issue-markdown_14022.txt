**Description**  
Symfony currently uses:
`if ('\\' !== DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR) { // PHP does not run in Windows }`
in many places. This could be changed to something like:
`if (OperatingSystem::WINDOWS !== $os->getType()) { // PHP does not run in
Windows }`
Is it worth my time to try to build something small like
https://packagist.org/packages/operating-system/operating-system into Symfony?
But since this simple thing was not done yet I suppose there is a good reason
for it?
My pros:
  * Better readability
  * One single place to change the detection (very unlikely that this will be needed)
My cons:
  * Performance loss
  * More complexity
