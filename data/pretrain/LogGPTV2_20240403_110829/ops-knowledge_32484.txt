Enter the "ipconfig" or "ifconfig" command in a command prompt or terminal window to get your local IP address and default gateway. 4. Open your router's admin page and navigate to the "Router Settings" or "Network Settings" option. 5. In the router settings, find the "VPN Settings" or "Security Settings" option. 6. In the VPN settings or security settings, select the "Enable VPN transmission" option and specify the IP address and port number of the VPN server. 7. In the VPN settings or security settings, select the "Enable offloading VPN traffic" option and specify the range of IP addresses that need to use the VPN connection. 8. In the VPN settings or security settings, select the "Enable VPN DNS resolution" option and specify the DNS address of the VPN server. 9. Save and apply your router settings. With these steps, your router will start routing all traffic within the specified range through the VPN tunnel to the VPN server, and through the VPN server for DNS resolution. This enables you to use a VPN connection for secure internet access and data transfer.
