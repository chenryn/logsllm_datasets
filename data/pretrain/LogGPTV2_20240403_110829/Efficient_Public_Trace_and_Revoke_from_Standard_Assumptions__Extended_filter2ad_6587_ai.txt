We note that by exploiting the fact that the attacker makes
random queries, we may improve the parameter sizes provided
by [4] exactly as in Subsection 4.2. In more detail, the proof
of Theorem 5 (Appendix F) in [4] can be modified to show
that the advantage of the adversary in Game 3 is negligible
even when 𝜎 is chosen as above, exactly as described in
Subsection 4.2.
Key and Ciphertext Sizes. The public key and master secret
key respectively consist of 𝑂((𝑡+𝑟) log 𝑁 ) and 𝑂((𝑡+𝑟) log 𝑁 )
bits. Note that the master secret key bit-length can be shrunk
to 𝑂(𝜆) by only storing the seed of the pseudo-random
generator used to create it. In that case, the master se-
cret key may be recomputed every time the KeyGen algo-
rithm is called. Further, to every user id corresponds a secret
key skid of bit-length 𝑂((𝑡 + 𝑟) log 𝑁 ) and a vector 𝑝id of
bit-length 𝑂((𝑡 + 𝑟) log 𝑁 ). Algorithm Enc maps a plaintext
in Z𝑁 ∖ {0} to a ciphertext of bit-length 𝑂((𝑡 + 𝑟) log 𝑁 ).
To compensate for the number field sieve, we must choose
log 𝑁 =̃︀Ω(𝜆3).

the tracing algorithm from [30] does not allow the adversary
to choose and corrupt keys of the revoked set in the tracing
game.
Combinatorial Schemes. We remark that another line of
work constructs combinatorial schemes [13, 29–31, 38, 39],
in contrast to the algebraic ones we have discussed so far;
however these are usually less efficient than the algebraic
candidates and the combination of trace and revoke is often
studied in weaker security models.
Parameters Obtained with the NWZ Compiler. The NWZ
compiler [32] may be instantiated with the bounded collusion
functional encryption scheme from [18]. This results in a
scheme that has a ciphertext size that depends polynomially
on the size of the circuit used by NWZ, as well as quartically
on the collusion bound 𝑟 + 𝑡. Since the circuit used by NWZ
has an input size of 𝑂(𝑟 + 𝑡), the ciphertext size grows at
least as 𝑂((𝑟 + 𝑡)5𝒫𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝜆)).
If the compiler is instantiated with the bounded collusion
scheme of [17] (compiled with [18]), then the ciphertext size
still grows as 𝑂((𝑟 + 𝑡)4𝒫𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝜆)), and moreover relies on the
subexponential hardness of learning with errors in addition
to heavy hammers such as fully homomorphic encryption and
attribute based encryption. We note that the 𝒫𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝜆) factors
above are unspecified, and possibly large: for instance, the
circuit in [18] is represented using randomizing polynomials
which adds a polynomial factor blow-up. Similarly, using
the bounded collusion FE of [5] leads to better asymptotic
bounds 𝑂(𝑟 + 𝑡)3𝒫𝑜𝑙𝑦(𝜆)) but also suffers from large poly-
nomial factors, since again the circuit is represented using
randomizing polynomials. Here, a quadratic factor (𝑟 + 𝑡)2 is
incurred by the query dependence of [5] and an additional
factor (𝑟 + 𝑡) is incurred due to circuit size dependence.

6 ADDITIONAL RELEVANT WORK
There are multiple parameters in trace-and-revoke systems
that one desires to optimize such as security definition, hard-
ness assumption, public traceability, collusion size, efficiency.
The most general adaptive security definition for trace and
revoke was provided by Boneh and Waters [11]. Here, the
adversary is permitted to adaptively make key requests, and
must finally submit a pirate decoder. For the adversary to win
the game, pirate decoder must be useful, i.e., the challenger
must be allowed to test it with various “probe” ciphertexts
and these must be decrypted with non-negligible probability,
and the tracing algorithm must be able to output at least
one user whose key was not requested by the adversary.
Strong Security for Trace and Revoke. The definition of
usefulness of the pirate decoder involves a subtlety – in the
strongest definition, the pirate decoder may be queried with
ciphertexts that may encode a set of maliciously chosen
revoked users [11]. Most constructions do not satisfy this
strong notion of security, indeed some schemes are actually
insecure in this strong game.
For instance in the schemes [14, 30], a probe ciphertext may
be distinguished from a normal ciphertext using a revoked key.
In the polynomial interpolation based method in [30], in order
to run tracing on a suspect set, the authority chooses a probe
polynomial which agrees with the original polynomial on all
the points in the suspected set. Therefore, if the suspected set
contains all the traitor keys, then the pirate cannot detect this
change from the original polynomial to the probe polynomial
and the tracing works well. However, if the pirate knows
one key (an evaluation of the original polynomial) in the
revoked set, then it can detect this change. This means that
a revoked key is useless in decrypting ciphertexts but useful
