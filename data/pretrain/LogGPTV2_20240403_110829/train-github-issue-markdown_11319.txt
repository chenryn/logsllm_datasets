Short version: setTimeout fails inside angular2 class cosntructor, but works
fine outside of its context.
Full example you will find here:
https://plnkr.co/GYir5dReBvTt0QrPp9eF?p=preview It contains function "run"
which starts coutdown (inside console). Once inside angular2 code, once
outside. The expected behavior is for countdown to hit zero both time.
ps. Tested at newest chrome/firefox on ubuntu system.  
ps. I've found two issues about setTimeout arguments: #344 and #6088. But I'm
not sure if they are related.
