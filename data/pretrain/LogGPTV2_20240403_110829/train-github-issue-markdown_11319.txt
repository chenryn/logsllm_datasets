**Short Version:**
`setTimeout` does not work as expected when used inside an Angular 2 class constructor, but it functions correctly outside of the Angular 2 context.

**Detailed Explanation:**
You can find a full example demonstrating this issue [here](https://plnkr.co/GYir5dReBvTt0QrPp9eF?p=preview). The example includes a function called `run`, which initiates a countdown (displayed in the console). The `run` function is executed both within and outside the Angular 2 context. The expected behavior is for the countdown to reach zero in both cases.

**Additional Information:**
- This has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox on an Ubuntu system.
- I have found two related issues regarding `setTimeout` arguments: #344 and #6088. However, I am not certain if they are directly related to this problem.
