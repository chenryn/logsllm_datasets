### Meta-Event 10: [P3, N2, V1, M2]
- **User Action:** `id` command
- **System Reactions:**
  1. Executes the `id` program.
  2. Checks user identity.
- **System Response:** Provides the user's identity information.

#### Manifestations
- **Syslog:** Weak
- **TCP:** No
- **Syscall:** Strong

### Analysis of Attack Manifestations
- There are no entries in the actual system violation logs. Stack operations are not visible in these logs; only the effects of the commands in the buffer overflow code can be seen.
- It is not evident from the network traffic log that the started X11 session is caused by the attack. However, it is clear in the syscall logs that the `tcpdump` program drastically changes its execution behavior after receiving the attack packet.
- The processes involved in the attack include `tcpdump`, which executes `sh`, and `xterm`.

### Table 4: Attack Events for the Tcpdump Attack
| Meta-Event | User Action | System Reactions | System Response |
|------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1: [P1, N2, V1, M1] | Attack with wrong offset | 1. Receive packet<br>2. Decode packet<br>3. Overwrite return address<br>4. Use new return address<br>5. `tcpdump` crash | No response |
| 2: [P2, N1, V1, M1] | Send buffer overflow AFS packet | 1. Receive packet<br>2. Decode packet<br>3. Overwrite return address<br>4. Use new return address<br>5. Execute attack code<br>6. Start Xterm with root shell | Xterm window with root prompt |
| 3: [P3, N2, V2, M2] | `whoami` command | 1. Execute `whoami` program<br>2. Check user identity | Answer to `whoami` |
| 4: [P3, N2, V2, M2] | `id` command | 1. Execute `id` program<br>2. Check user identity | Answer to `id` |

#### Presence of Attack Manifestations
| Meta-Event | Syslog | TCP | Syscall |
|------------|--------|-----|---------|
| 1 | No | No | No |
| 2 | No | No | No |
| 3 | No | No | No |
| 4 | No | No | No |

- **Meta-Events 1 and 2** are both useful, but Event 2 is slightly better because the user does not need to try the attack with the wrong offset before succeeding. We focus on the indicators for Event 2 here.

### Detailed Indicators
- **Indicator 1:** Checks the length of incoming packets to port 7000. The length of the attack packet likely exceeds the normal length.
- **Indicator 2:** Verifies if the system responds to the incoming packet on port 7000.

#### Additional Indicators
- **[U2, C1]**: Tcpdump header
- **[U2, C2]**: Tcpdump header
- **[U2, C1]**: Tcpdump header
- **[U1, C1]**: Tcpdump with data
- **[U1, C2]**: Tcpdump with data
- **[U3, C1]**: Tcpdump with data
- **[U2, C1]**: Syscall name
- **[U2, C1]**: Syscall name
- **[U2, C1]**: Syscall name
- **[U2, C1]**: Syscall name
- **[U2, C2]**: Syscall sequence
