The `Pkg.clone` function in Julia supports cloning a package using its registered name. If you attempt to clone a package that is not registered, the behavior varies between different versions of Julia.

In Julia v0.4, attempting to clone an unregistered package results in an error. For example:

```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("Foo")
INFO: Cloning Foo from Foo
fatal: repository 'Foo' does not exist
ERROR: unlink: no such file or directory (ENOENT)
 in unlink at fs.jl:102
 in rm at file.jl:59
 in clone at pkg/entry.jl:162
 in clone at pkg/entry.jl:186
 in anonymous at pkg/dir.jl:31
 in cd at file.jl:22
 in cd at pkg/dir.jl:31
 in clone at pkg.jl:34
```

In contrast, in Julia v0.5.0-rc3, the same command succeeds without any warnings or errors, even if the package is not registered:

```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("Foo")
INFO: Cloning Foo from Foo
INFO: Computing changes...
```

This difference in behavior highlights the importance of ensuring that the package name is correctly registered or that the specified repository URL is valid when using `Pkg.clone`.
