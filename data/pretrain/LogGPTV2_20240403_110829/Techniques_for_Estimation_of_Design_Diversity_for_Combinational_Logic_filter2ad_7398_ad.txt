If  we can tolerate an error of  10 % for high values of 
di,j  - i.e., the  value  of  E  is  0.1  - then,  in  each  Monte- 
Carlo  experiment  we  have  to  apply  N =  15,200  input

we  have  to  apply  a  total  of  around  150  (30) thousand 
input combinations.  When  the  number  of  inputs  of  the 
given logic  function is  very  high  (greater  than  20), this

MCNC benchmark circuits and compared the results with 
those obtained by  exhaustive simulation.  The benchmark 
circuits  considered are such that exhaustive simulation is 
feasible. 
For  the  adaptive  Monte-Carlo  simulation 
technique, we used different parameters; (1) 1 % error and 
2 Monte-Carlo experiments with  1.52 million  simulations 
in  each  experiment;  (2)  1% error  and  10  Monte-Carlo 
simulation experiments with  1.52 million  simulations  in 
each  experiment;  (3)  10%  error  and  2  Monte-Carlo 
simulation  experiments  with  0.0152 million  simulations 
in  each  experiment;  and,  (4)  10% error  and  10 Monte- 
Carlo  experiments  with  0.0152  million  simulations  in 
each experiment.  The results  in Table 5.2  show that  the 
theoretical  arguments  behind  adaptive  Monte-Carlo 
simulation  are  applicable  for  real-life  circuits  and 
demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the  adaptive  Monte- 
Carlo simulation technique. 
6.  Conclusions 
This paper demonstrates the feasibility  of  calculating 
the  value  of  the  design  diversity  metric  for  arbitrary 
combinational  logic  circuits.  Although  the  general 
problem  is  NP-complete,  efficient  algorithms  can  be 
devised  for  solving  the  problem.  For  datapath  logic 
circuits  and  circuits  with  iterative  logic  networks,  the 
regularity  in  the  circuit  structures  can  be  exploited  to 
compute the value of the diversity metric very fast.  For 
general combinational logic circuits, reduction techniques 
using fault equivalence and fault dominance relationships 
can be applied to significantly reduce the number of  fault 
pairs to be considered during diversity calculation.  Next, 
the  adaptive  Monte-Carlo  simulation  technique  can  be 
used  to obtain accurate  estimates of  the  diversity  metric 
for  the  reduced  set  of  fault  pairs  using  the  number  of 
simulations which is polynomial  (instead of  exponential) 
in  the  number  of  inputs  of  the  combinational  logic 
function.  Moreover, the number of simulations to be used 
can be tuned depending on the error that can be  tolerated 
during  estimation.  This  paper  describes  techniques  for 
estimating  diversity  in  combinational  logic  circuits;  a

Thus, if we choose M: 6 and E appropriately, then we 
can obtain close approximation of the di,j values. 
Theorem 5: The value of Zi is equal to:

Zj = 2  (2 -1) if  CO = 0 is the only value CO can have; 
21 
if  CO  can  be  both  0  or  1  with  equal

probability. 
Proof:  The  value of  xi  can  be  expressed using  the 
following recurrence relation: 
2(1- 1) 
Zj = 2 
+ 2Zj-1, and 
Z1 = 1 ifcO=O,andZl = 4 i f c o = O a n d c o = l  are 
equally likely. 
The above recurrence relation  follows from  the  fact 
that when Aj = 1 and Bj = 1, then  the value of  Cj will be 
1, irrespective of the remaining bits.  However, when A j  = 
0 and Bj = 1, or vice-versa, then we want Cj-1 to be equal 
to 1.  When i =1, then only Ai = 1 and Bi = 1 can make Cj 
equal to  1.  The solution to the above recurrence relation 
(2'-1).  This  can  be  obtained  very 
is  given  by  Zj  = 2 
easily  by  using  the  simple  technique  of  generating 
functions. 
If  CO = 0 and  CO = 1 are equally likely,  Z1  = 4 and

hence, Zj = 2  from the above recurrence relation. 
Q.E.D. 
Appendix B 
There  can  be  two  kinds  of  errors  in  the  adaptive 
Monte-Carlo estimation technique.  The actual di,j value 
can  be  high  but  we  can  erroneously  declare  that  the 
estimated di,j value is very low.  Although  this  situation 
will  produce  pessimistic  values,  it  is  not  desired.  As 
noted in Sec. 5.2, 6 is the probability that the value of di,j 
is out of  the error bound.  Hence, the probability that the 
di,j  value  is  erroneously declared  to  be  less  than  0.5  is 
the  value 
The other source of  error is  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
actual  djJ  value  may  be  less  than  0.5  but  for  all  the 
Monte-Carlo  simulation  experiments 
is 
estimated to be  greater  than  or  equal  to 0.5.  The  worst 
scenario  is  when  the  actual  di,j  value  is  exponentially 
small but the estimated value is close to  1.  We show next 
that  the probability  of  such  an  event  is extremely  small 
and  is  almost  negligible.  The  following  fact  has  been

When  the  value  of  p is  exponentially 
small. x is of the order of 2". and this probability becomes 
extremely small. 
Thus,  our  Monte-Carlo  simulation  is  adaptive  and 
suits  the  current  application  - it  provides  very  good 
estimates for high di,j values and makes sure that we  do 
not  erroneously  estimate  very  high  (optimistic)  values 
when  the  actual dj,j value  is  extremely  small  (less  than 
0.5).
