User: Introduce the HTTPS protocol in detail, including its principle, encryption mechanism and handshake process.
Assistant: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure HTTP protocol based on TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocols. HTTPS establishes an encryption layer on the transport layer, which can ensure that data will not be eavesdropped, tampered with or forged during transmission. At present, HTTPS has become a standard protocol for website information security, and many websites are gradually changing to the HTTPS protocol. The principle of HTTPS is to provide security guarantee by adding a security protocol layer between HTTP and TCP. When the HTTP protocol is used for data transmission, the data is transmitted in clear text, which is easy to be hijacked or eavesdropped by the middleman, and HTTPS adds the SSL/TLS protocol stack to the HTTP, so that the two communicating parties can complete identity verification, encrypt data, and complete data transmission when transmitting data. Security detection and other operations to ensure the security of HTTPS data. The encryption mechanism of HTTPS is realized through public key encryption. Before the HTTPS communication starts, an SSL handshake is required between the browser and the server. The handshake process involves multiple links such as encryption, identity verification, parameter negotiation, and digital certificates. During the process, two parties exchange certificates to establish a secure connection, and then transmit data encrypted and decrypted using a shared key. The TLS/SSL protocol stack is a layer of security protocol above the HTTP protocol. If the communication between the two is linked, the data can be encrypted and transmitted through secure channel negotiation. The HTTPS handshake process includes the following steps: 1. The browser sends a request to the server and initiates an SSL/TLS protocol version. 2. After receiving the request, the server responds with the selected SSL/TLS protocol version and digital certificate. This digital certificate is issued by the X.509 certificate authority installed on the server, which includes the server public key and related information. 3. The browser checks the validity of the certificate. If the certificate issuer is trusted and the digital certificate has not expired or been revoked, a random key is encrypted by the RSA algorithm and then sent to the server. 4. After receiving the encrypted random key, the server decrypts it with its own private key to obtain the browser's random key. 5. Both the browser and the server maintain a shared key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt data, thereby ensuring the security of HTTPS data transmission. In short, HTTPS establishes an encryption layer on the transport layer to encrypt and transmit HTTP protocol data to ensure data security. Whether it is in encrypted transmission, preventing packet capture information, or in terms of security, the HTTPS protocol is far more secure than the HTTP protocol, and is more suitable for online banking, e-commerce, online payment, online payment, etc. that need to ensure information security. occasion.
