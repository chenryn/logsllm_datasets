User: I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I guess different versions of python are pre-installed in Ubuntu 14.04. Right now when I type 'python' in terminal it opens python 2.7.11, but I guess the default version of Ubuntu 14.04 is 2.7.6. When I type /usr/bin/python it opens the default version. I know this can be done with making aliases. The real problem is, I have installed pygame, cv2 (that is for image processing) using apt-get. These are installed for default version of python i.e python 2.7.6. Also I have installed anaconda with python 2.7.11 using pip, but again 'pip' and anaconda are installed for 2.7.11. I know python 3 is also pre-installed there but I don't use it. Also I have no python version installed in user/local/bin.Now I want to know why this problem is occurring? How can I fix this now? Also how to import all the libraries for one python version(either default or another) and how to use it? How to configure my settings so that I would not have any problem in future?
Assistant: First of all I want to thanks Bennet for responding to my question so that I was able to figure out what the problem was. Actually the problem was with aliasing. When I installed cv2 or pygame using apt-get, they were installed for default version but when I installed any package by downloading the installer first (like I installed anaconda), it was installed for python 2.7.11 because 'python' was aliased for this version(that is 2.7.11). So, basically make sure that the default version for which you want to install everything is the one which is aliased as 'python', and everything goes fine. I aliased 'python' for the default version and then installed anaconda via installer and now it has been installed default version.
