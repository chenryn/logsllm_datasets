It seems like the text you provided is jumbled and contains a lot of non-sequential characters, making it difficult to understand the intended message. However, based on the fragments, it appears to be discussing some form of performance metrics for different memory management algorithms, particularly in the context of multi-core systems and the impact of row-buffer size and the number of DRAM banks.

### 8: Slowdown of Different Application Combinations Using FR-FCFS and FairMem Algorithm

**Figure 8:**
This figure illustrates the slowdown of various application combinations when using the First-Ready First-Come-First-Served (FR-FCFS) scheduling algorithm and our proposed FairMem algorithm. The applications considered include `art`, `vpr`, `health`, `stream`, `rdarray`, and `mcf`.

**Baseline (FR-FCFS):**
- **Throughput Unfairness:** 
  - `art`: 24.8
  - `vpr`: 401.4
  - `health`: 463.8
  - `stream`: 179.3
  - `rdarray`: 65.9
  - `mcf`: 38.0
  - `art-vpr`: 87.2
  - `health-vpr`: 63.1
  - `art-health`: 51.2

**FairMem:**
- **Throughput Improvement:**
  - `art`: 2.00
  - `vpr`: 2.23
  - `health`: 1.56
  - `stream`: 1.62
  - `rdarray`: 2.24
  - `mcf`: 8.14
  - `art-vpr`: 8.73
  - `health-vpr`: 5.17
  - `art-health`: 4.06

**Combination:**
- `stream-rdarray`
- `art-vpr`
- `health-vpr`
- `art-health`
- `rdarray-art`
- `stream-health`
- `stream-vpr`
- `stream-mcf`
- `stream-art`

**Fairness Improvement:**
- `stream-rdarray`: 1.89X
- `art-vpr`: 2.23X
- `health-vpr`: 1.43X
- `art-health`: 1.41X
- `rdarray-art`: 2.11X
- `stream-health`: 6.90X
- `stream-vpr`: 7.86X
- `stream-mcf`: 4.79X
- `stream-art`: 3.83X

### Table 3: Effect of FairMem on Overall Throughput and Unfairness

|-------------|---------------------|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `stream-rdarray` | 22.5 | 513.0 | 1.06 | 1.89X |
| `art-vpr` | 508.4 | 178.5 | 1.00 | 2.23X |
| `health-vpr` | 97.1 | 72.5 | 1.09 | 1.43X |
| `art-health` | 390.6 | 117.1 | 1.15 | 1.41X |
| `rdarray-art` | 98.6 | 1.06 | 1.18 | 2.11X |
| `stream-health` | 1.11 | 1.08 | 1.06 | 6.90X |
| `stream-vpr` | 0.91X | 1.28X | 1.10X | 7.86X |
| `stream-mcf` | 0.99X | 1.47X | 1.91X | 4.48X |
| `stream-art` | 4.48X | 1.86X | 1.93X | 3.83X |

### 6.2.2 Effect of Row-buffer Size

From the above discussions, it is clear that the exploitation of row-buffer locality by the DRAM memory controller makes the multi-core memory system vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The extent to which this vulnerability can be exploited is determined by the size of the row-buffer. In this section, we examine the impact of row-buffer size on the effectiveness of our algorithm. For these sensitivity experiments, we use two real applications, `art` and `vpr`, where `art` behaves as a Memory Performance Hog (MPH) against `vpr`.

**Figure 9:**
This figure shows the mutual impact of `art` and `vpr` on machines with different row-buffer sizes. Additional statistics are presented in Table 4. As the row-buffer size increases, the extent to which `art` becomes a memory performance hog for `vpr` increases when the FR-FCFS scheduling algorithm is used. In a system with very small, 512-byte row-buffers, `vpr` experiences a slowdown of 1.65X (versus `art`'s 1.05X). In a system with very large, 64 KB row-buffers, `vpr` experiences a slowdown of 5.50X (versus `art`'s 1.03X). Because `art` has very high row-buffer locality, a large buffer size allows its accesses to occupy a bank much longer than a small buffer size does. Hence, `art`'s ability to deny bank service to `vpr` increases with row-buffer size. FairMem effectively contains this denial of service and results in similar slowdowns for both `art` and `vpr` (1.32X to 1.41X).

It is commonly assumed that row-buffer sizes will increase in the future to allow better throughput for streaming applications [41]. As our results show, this implies that memory-related DoS attacks will become a larger problem, and algorithms to prevent them will become more important.

### 6.2.3 Effect of Number of Banks

The number of DRAM banks is another important parameter that affects how much two threads can interfere with each other's memory accesses. Figure 10 shows the impact of `art` and `vpr` on each other on machines with different numbers of DRAM banks. As the number of banks increases, the available parallelism in the system also increases, reducing the interference between threads.

**Note:**
Reducing the row-buffer size may at first seem like one way of reducing the impact of memory-related DoS attacks. However, this solution is not desirable because reducing the row-buffer size significantly reduces the memory bandwidth (hence performance) for applications with good row-buffer locality even when they are running alone or when they are not interfering with other applications.
