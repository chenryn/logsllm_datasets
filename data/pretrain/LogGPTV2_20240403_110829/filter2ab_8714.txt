### Title: Blackhat Asia 2019: Zombie POODLE, GOLDENDOODLE, and How TLSv1.3 Can Save Us All

HTTPS is the cornerstone of online privacy and commerce, yet for two decades, the underlying Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has been subject to only incremental and often superficial fixes. Instead of deprecating cryptographic techniques with known vulnerabilities, the TLSv1.2 specification includes a long list of workarounds, countermeasures, and caveats that must be meticulously followed to prevent attacks. This is evident from the continued use of PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, RC4 encryption, and CBC mode ciphers in TLSv1.2.

In this session, we will present research on more effective testing and exploitation techniques for CBC padding oracles. We will demonstrate how a minor modification to the POODLE vulnerability allowed it to resurface in a major enterprise HTTPS implementation, more than three years after it was initially patched. Additionally, we will introduce GOLDENDOODLE, a specialized attack based on POODLE that can disclose session IDs significantly faster than the original POODLE attack. The GOLDENDOODLE attack also reveals that a previously unknown Cisco ASA CVE, which was not thought to affect confidentiality, can indeed expose sensitive data, such as session cookies, to a network-based attacker.

This presentation will highlight the importance of adopting TLSv1.3, which addresses many of these long-standing issues and provides a more secure foundation for online communication.
