with category tags—“pharma”, “replica”, “software”—that
correspond to the goods they are selling. The keywords
consist of large sets of major brand names (Viagra, Rolex,
Microsoft, etc.) as well as domain-speciﬁc terms (herbal,
pharmacy, watches, software, etc.) that appear in the store-
front page. These terms are tied to the content being sold
by the storefront site, and are also used for search engine
optimization (SEO). Any page containing a threshold of
these terms is tagged with the corresponding keyword. The
remaining URLs do not advertise products that we study and
they are left untagged.
Even with our conservative approach, a concern is that
our keyword matching heuristics might have missed a site
of interest. Thus, for the remaining untagged clusters, we
manually checked for such false negatives, i.e., whether
there were clusters of storefront pages selling one of the
three goods that should have a category tag, but did not.
We examined the pages in the largest 675 untagged clusters
(in terms of number of pages) as well as 1,000 randomly
selected untagged clusters, which together correspond to
39% of the URLs we crawled. We did not ﬁnd any clusters
with storefronts that we missed.6
Program tagging: At this point, we focus entirely on clus-
ters tagged with one of our three categories, and identify sets
of distinct clusters that belong to the same afﬁliate program.
In particular, we label clusters with speciﬁc program tags to
associate them either with a certain afﬁliate program (e.g.,
EvaPharmacy—which in turn has many distinct storefront
brands) or, when we cannot mechanically categorize the
underlying program structure, with an individual storefront
“brand” (e.g., Prestige Replicas). From insight gained by
browsing underground forum discussions, examining the raw
HTML for common implementation artifacts, and making
product purchases, we found that some sets of the these
brands are actually operated by the same afﬁliate program.
In total, we assigned program tags to 30 pharmaceutical,
5 software, and 10 replica programs that dominated the
URLs in our feeds. Table IV enumerates these afﬁliate
programs and brands, showing the number of distinct regis-
tered domains used by those programs, and the number of
URLs that use those domains. We also show two aggregate
programs, Mailien and ZedCash, whose storefront brands
we associated manually based on evidence gathered on
underground Web forums (later validated via the purchasing
process).7 The “feed volume” shows the distribution of the
afﬁliate programs as observed in each of the spam “sink”
feeds (the feeds not from bots), roughly approximating the
6The lack of false negatives is not too surprising. Missing storefronts
would have no textual terms in their page content that relate to what they
are selling (incidentally also preventing the use of SEO); this situation could
occur if the storefront page were composed entirely of images, but such
sites are rare.
7Note, ZedCash is unique among programs as it has storefront brands
for each of the herbal, pharmaceutical and replica product categories.

distribution that might be observed by users receiving spam.8
To assign these afﬁliate program tags to clusters, we
manually crafted sets of regular expressions that match the
page contents of program storefronts. For some programs,
8We remove botnet feeds from such volume calculations because their
skewed domain mix would bias the results unfairly towards the programs
they advertise.

we deﬁned expressions that capture the structural nature of
the software engine used by all storefronts for a program
(e.g., almost all EvaPharmacy sites contained unique hosting
conventions). For other programs, we deﬁned expressions
that capture the operational modes used by programs that
templates (e.g., GlavMed).9 For
used multiple storefront
others, we created expressions for individual storefront
brands (e.g., one for Diamond Replicas, another for Prestige
Replicas, etc.), focusing on the top remaining clusters in
terms of number of pages. Altogether, we assigned program
tags to clusters comprising 86% of the pages that had
category tags.
We manually validated the results of assigning these
speciﬁc program tags as well. For every cluster with a
program tag, we inspected the ten most and least common
page DOMs contained in that cluster, and validated that
our expressions had assigned them their correct program
tags. Although not exhaustive, examining the most and least
common pages validates the pages comprising both the
“mass” and “tail” of the page distribution in the cluster.
Not all clusters with a category tag (“pharma”) had a
speciﬁc program tag (“EvaPharmacy”). Some clusters with
category tags were false positives (they happened to have
category keywords in the page, but were not storefronts
selling category goods), or they were small clusters cor-
responding to storefronts with tiny spam footprints. We
inspected the largest 675 of these clusters and veriﬁed that
none of them contained pages that should have been tagged
as a particular program in our study.
D. Purchasing
Finally, for a subset of the sites with program tags, we
also purchased goods being offered for sale. We attempted to
place multiple purchases from each major afﬁliate program
or store “brand” in our study and, where possible, we
ordered the same “types” of product from different sites
to identify differences or similarities in suppliers based on
contents (e.g., lot numbers) and packaging (nominal sender,
packaging type, etc.). We attempted 120 purchases, of which
76 authorized and 56 settled.10
Of those that settled, all but seven products were deliv-
ered. We conﬁrmed via tracking information that two unde-
livered packages were sent several weeks after our mailbox
lease had ended, two additional transactions received no
follow-up email, another two sent a follow-up email stating
that the order was re-sent after the mailbox lease had ended,
9We obtained the full source code for all GlavMed and RX–Promotion
sites, which aided creating and validating expressions to match their
templates.
