### Categorization and Tagging of Storefronts

Storefronts are categorized using tags such as "pharma," "replica," and "software," which correspond to the goods they sell. The keywords used for tagging include major brand names (e.g., Viagra, Rolex, Microsoft) and domain-specific terms (e.g., herbal, pharmacy, watches, software). These terms are relevant to the content being sold and are also used for search engine optimization (SEO). Any page containing a sufficient number of these keywords is tagged with the corresponding category. URLs that do not advertise the products we study remain untagged.

### Addressing False Negatives

Despite our conservative approach, there was a concern that our keyword-matching heuristics might have missed some sites of interest. To address this, we manually checked the largest 675 untagged clusters (by the number of pages) and 1,000 randomly selected untagged clusters, which together accounted for 39% of the crawled URLs. We did not find any clusters with storefronts that should have been tagged but were not. This lack of false negatives is not surprising, as missing storefronts would have no textual terms related to their products, making SEO ineffective. Such sites, composed entirely of images, are rare.

### Program Tagging

Next, we focused on clusters tagged with one of our three categories and identified distinct clusters belonging to the same affiliate program. We assigned specific program tags to associate clusters with particular affiliate programs (e.g., EvaPharmacy, which has many distinct storefront brands) or, when we could not categorize the underlying program structure, with individual storefront brands (e.g., Prestige Replicas).

Through insights gained from browsing underground forum discussions, examining raw HTML for common implementation artifacts, and making product purchases, we found that some sets of these brands are operated by the same affiliate program. In total, we assigned program tags to 30 pharmaceutical, 5 software, and 10 replica programs that dominated the URLs in our feeds. Table IV provides a detailed breakdown of these affiliate programs and brands, showing the number of distinct registered domains and the number of URLs using those domains. Two aggregate programs, Mailien and ZedCash, were associated manually based on evidence gathered from underground web forums and validated through the purchasing process.

### Validation of Program Tags

We manually validated the results of assigning specific program tags. For each cluster with a program tag, we inspected the ten most and least common page DOMs to ensure our expressions had correctly assigned the program tags. This method validates both the "mass" and "tail" of the page distribution in the cluster.

Not all clusters with a category tag (e.g., "pharma") received a specific program tag (e.g., "EvaPharmacy"). Some clusters with category tags were false positives, either because they contained category keywords but were not selling the goods, or because they were small clusters with minimal spam footprints. We inspected the largest 675 of these clusters and verified that none of them contained pages that should have been tagged with a specific program.

### Product Purchasing

Finally, for a subset of sites with program tags, we purchased goods being offered for sale. We attempted multiple purchases from each major affiliate program or store brand, ordering the same types of products from different sites to identify differences or similarities in suppliers based on contents (e.g., lot numbers) and packaging (nominal sender, packaging type, etc.). We attempted 120 purchases, of which 76 were authorized and 56 settled. Of those that settled, all but seven products were delivered. Tracking information confirmed that two undelivered packages were sent after our mailbox lease ended, two transactions received no follow-up email, and another two sent a follow-up email stating that the order was re-sent after the mailbox lease ended.

### Regular Expressions for Tagging

To assign affiliate program tags to clusters, we manually crafted sets of regular expressions that match the page contents of program storefronts. For some programs, we defined expressions that capture the structural nature of the software engine used by all storefronts (e.g., unique hosting conventions in EvaPharmacy sites). For others, we defined expressions that capture the operational modes used by programs with multiple storefront templates (e.g., GlavMed). For still others, we created expressions for individual storefront brands (e.g., Diamond Replicas, Prestige Replicas), focusing on the top remaining clusters by the number of pages. Altogether, we assigned program tags to clusters comprising 86% of the pages that had category tags.

### Conclusion

This comprehensive approach ensures that the categorization and tagging of storefronts are accurate and reliable, providing a robust framework for further analysis and understanding of the online marketplace.
