User: Use Nginx reverse proxy to implement a load balancing system that supports dynamic scheduling of multiple nodes.
Assistant: The steps are as follows: 1. Install Nginx and make sure it can start normally. 2. Configure the configuration file of the Nginx reverse proxy, for example, create a configuration file example.conf in the /etc/nginx/conf.d/ directory. 3. Configure the upstream address of each node, for example: ``` upstream backend { server 10.0.0.1:8000; server 10.0.0.2:8000; server 10.0.0.3:8000; } ``` 4. Configure Nginx to respond to requests Common load balancing strategies include the following: - Round robin (default): Each request is allocated to the backend nodes in sequence. - IP hash: Send the request to the corresponding node according to the hash value of the client's IP address. - Minimal connections: send the request to the node with the fewest connections (requires upstream module). - Weighted polling: set the weight of each node, and request to distribute to the back-end nodes according to the weight. For example, using a round-robin load balancing strategy: ``` upstream backend { server 10.0.0.1:8000; server 10.0.0.2:8000; server 10.0.0.3:8000; } server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } ``` 5. Restart the Nginx service for the configuration to take effect. Note: If you need to dynamically schedule nodes, you can use third-party tools, such as Consul, Zookeeper, etc., to store the status of the nodes in the registry, and then Nginx can obtain available node information from it.
