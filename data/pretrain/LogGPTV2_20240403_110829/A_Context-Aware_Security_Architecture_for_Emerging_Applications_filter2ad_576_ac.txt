to both uncached and cached values. However, we feel that
our implementation is highly efﬁcient in determining ERole
status – the majority of time spent evaluating ERole status
is actually spent in communicating with the environmental
sensors that monitor variable conditions.
In order to ensure that policies are protected and that
credentials are not observed during transmission, we also
support encrypted communication channels in the CASA
implementation. We have performed a second set of exper-
iments in which we generate the same access requests as
before but use an SSL-encrypted HTTP channel over which
the services communicate. As before, there were a total
of eleven access requests sent to the Authorization Service.
Table 2 shows the results of our application test.
The results presented here were all obtained using SSL-
encrypted HTTP communication channels and, when com-
pared to the previous results, demonstrate the cost of es-
tablishing and using secure communications. This protocol
selection resulted in a delay that was caused by SSL-related
key exchange and session establishment. The overhead in-
troduced by the processing at the services is not signiﬁcant
when compared to the connection establishment and com-
munication times. We are currently working on a communi-
cation subsystem that utilizes session key-reuse; we expect
this to eliminate a signiﬁcant portion of the overhead cost
associated with the HTTPS-based communication.
The experimental results show that services in our ar-
chitecture can authorize requests in a reasonable amount
of time. Furthermore, by taking advantage of our caching
framework and other runtime efﬁciencies, such as leav-
ing established (secure) connections open between requests,
context-aware security does not present any signiﬁcant
overhead to the application.
In future work we will complete our analysis of the over-
all architecture and are currently building a secure imple-
mentation of a smart intercom application that will provide
a foundation for our experiments. Not only will we focus
on comparing an insecure, context-aware application with
a secured version, but analyzing the effectiveness of the in-
terfaces that are exposed to residents in the Aware Home as
well.

5 Related Work
Despite considerable interest and research in pervasive
computing [23, 19], security concerns in such environments
have received little attention.
In this section, we brieﬂy
highlight several existing projects and technologies that
have inﬂuenced our work with providing security services
in context-aware environments.
There are a number of well-known architectures that
have been used to build secure systems in the past. The
Kerberos system [13] implements a protocol that can be
used to efﬁciently authenticate entities in a distributed sys-
tem. Satyanarayanan [21] discusses the architectural issues
surrounding the security services that are incorporated into
the Andrew distributed computing environment. In addi-
tion, signiﬁcant work has been focused on the modeling,
building and analysis of secure Public Key Infrastructures
(PKIs). Other issues related to building secure distributed
systems, including subject role authentication and delega-
tion are addressed by Lampson et. al. [15].
In addition to these architectures, other security infras-
tructures have been presented to speciﬁcally address the
needs of authorization logic. In [2], an architecture is pro-
posed for securing distributed document management sys-
tem. The authors address the need for an access control
logic in a complex distributed system. In particular, they
discuss a logic that supports linked local name spaces and
the management of a large system spread across adminis-
trative domains.
Al-Muhtadi et al. [1] present an approach to transfer tra-
ditional security solutions—speciﬁcally the Kerberos ex-
tension SESAME—into “smart spaces” such as the home.
Their work focuses on the integration issues that must be ad-
dressed when placing computing-intensive security mecha-
nisms into devices with limited resources. While a GRBAC-
like component could conceivably be added to their solu-
tion, our architecture is appropriate in the context-aware
environments that we target. The architecture that we pro-
pose can support partial authentication, context-aware ac-
cess control and dynamic policy generation based on roles –
elements not found in traditional computing environments.
We have also discussed traditional Role-based Access
Control (RBAC) [20, 9] and acknowledge the tremendous
inﬂuence it has had on our research efforts. Our work ex-
pands the RBAC model by providing a more versatile and
more expressive framework that incorporates the use of en-
vironment and object roles. By using the uniform notion of
a role to capture user, environmental and resource attributes,
our model allows for the deﬁnition of context-aware secu-
rity policies. In addition, roles make it easy to deﬁne and
understand complex security policies.
The use of XML in security policy deﬁnition has been
studied in numerous contexts, though work in this area
has focused primarily on the development of access control
models and methods to address encryption in the language.
Some of the more relevant work in XML security includes
[7] in which Damiani et al. present an access control model
that uses an XML-based approach to deﬁne and enforce
access restrictions directly on the structure and content of
Web documents. In [3], Bertino et al. present an XML-
compliant formalism for specifying security-related infor-
mation for Web document protection. In addition, Herzberg
et al. present a Trust Policy Language (TPL) [11] that de-
ﬁnes policies using a well-formed XML document. Finally,
Netegrity [18] has presented S2ML, a Security Services
Markup Language that provides a mechanism for describ-
ing existing security models using XML syntax.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we have introduced a new model for se-
curing context-aware environments and describe why we
believe it will be useful for securing applications in the
highly-connected world of tomorrow. Much of this work is
focused on providing more adaptive security services than
those found in traditional computing environments.
We have presented a framework for providing authoriza-
tion services in context-aware environments and applica-
tions. This framework supports the collection of contex-
tual information from resources, the environment and the
users who interact in that environment. In addition, we have
explored, through the context aware security architecture,
an implementation of the Generalized Role-Based Access
Control model. We have discussed our initial experience
with the security framework and provided experimental re-
sults regarding its effectiveness in securing context-aware
applications.
