Finds changes in traffic flows that 
indicate exfiltration.
Notes: 
Analysis Techniques: Identify 
changes in host roles, and invest-
igate. PCR is a normalized metric 
of traffic ratios and from a host 
ranging from -1 to 1.
PCR = ( bytesin - bytesout ) / ( 
bytesin + bytesout )
PCR host role:bytesin + bytesout )
PCR host role:
l 1.0 pure push - FTP upload,
| PCR | multicast, beaconing | PCR(field1,field2) |
|---|---|---|
| PCR |l 0.4 70:30 export - Sending |PCR(field1,field2) |
Email
l 0.0 Balanced Exchange -
	NTP, ARP probe
l -0.5 3:1 import - HTTP Brows-
	ing
l -1.0 pure pull - HTTP Down-
	load
DNS is less noisy than HTTP for 
this metric, and is a possible exfil 
channel. A positive shift in PCRchannel. A positive shift in PCR 
for DNS traffic may indicate DNS 
Exfil.
