While VS Code uses the same css.plist for CSS syntax highlighting as TextMate,
Atom has this own forked version that is way more up to date:  
https://github.com/atom/language-
css/blob/01146c2eac7d47455d5c964dd65eaeb209cfa778/grammars/css.cson
Would be nice to find a way to keep all three in sync.
Not all parts of css.plist are used in VSCode. For example some features such
as the Media Query media features are highlighted from css.plist, but CSS
properties that are not included in the file such as the flex box properties
get highlighted anyway. Iâ€™m not 100% sure which ones need to always be up to
date, and which ones don't matter for VSCode yet.
