The following gives a syntax error on master as well as 1.5:
    julia> f(@m for i in 1:3
               println(i)
           end)
    ERROR: syntax: missing comma or ) in argument list
    Stacktrace:
     [1] top-level scope at none:1
Interestingly enough, it works just fine if I replace the `for` loop with a
`begin`/`let`/`function`/... block. It even parses if I just wrap the `for`
loop in `begin ... end` or braces.
