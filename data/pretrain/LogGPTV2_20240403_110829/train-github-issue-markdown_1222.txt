The following code produces a syntax error in both the master branch and version 1.5 of Julia:

```julia
julia> f(@m for i in 1:3
           println(i)
       end)
ERROR: syntax: missing comma or ) in argument list
Stacktrace:
 [1] top-level scope at none:1
```

Interestingly, the code works correctly if the `for` loop is replaced with a `begin`, `let`, `function`, or similar block. The code also parses successfully if the `for` loop is wrapped in `begin ... end` or braces. 

For example, the following variations work without errors:

```julia
julia> f(@m begin
           for i in 1:3
               println(i)
           end
       end)

julia> f(@m let
           for i in 1:3
               println(i)
           end
       end)

julia> f(@m (for i in 1:3
               println(i)
           end))
```

This suggests that the issue is specific to using a `for` loop directly within the macro call.
