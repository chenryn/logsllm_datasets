User: I have a custom shell which looks like below.
testuser:
How do I set custom PROMPT attribute to login to a shell which look like
I'm reusing the hive.py code from samples section and set original_prompt to :.
original_prompt='[:]'
The result is it skips the host as it fails to connect with 

ERROR could not synchronize with original prompt

What am I missing?
Thanking in anticipation.
Assistant: The prompt should be needed after having written a command and waiting for it to finish. You have to tell "readline" what it should expect (in your case "testuser:").
