and an average NER of 4.0%. In addition, the performance
is barely affected by the type of display devices, cameras,
IDs, and ambient lights. We believe that mID is a promising
technique and can work complementarily to several existing
methods to cope with illegal information leakage. Future di-
rections that worth studying include exploring a wider attack
range and further improving the decoding accuracy.

11.1 Minimal Photograph Distance
Considering the goal of recording the conﬁdential information
displayed on the screen with smartphones, we assume the
adversary is likely to capture the screen in complete and
hold the smartphone vertically to avoid the signs of secret
ﬁlming. In this case, the photograph distance D adopted by
the adversary shall be larger than a minimal value Dmin to
contain the entire screen in photos.
According to Equ. 4, the photograph distance D can be
Sob j×L f
calculated as D =
Scam . For the minimal distance Dmin,
Sob j is the physical width of the display screen, L f is the
physical focal length of the camera, and Scam refers to the
image width of the camera. Scam can be further calculated as
Scam = Sp × Np, where Sp is the size of a single pixel and Np
is the number of pixels in width of the camera. As a result,
Dmin can be given as follows:
Dmin =
Sob j × L f
Scam
Sob j × L f
Sp × Np
=
(15)
= 53.1cm×5mm
With the device speciﬁcations in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, we can
calculate the minimal photograph distance Dmin for various
screen-camera settings. For instance, for our default setting,
i.e., the BenQ EW2440ZC monitor for image display and
the LG Nexus 5X smartphone for image capture, Dmin =
Sob j×L f
1.55µm×3024 = 56.6cm. For HUAWEI Mate 10,
Sp×Np
HUAWEI P9, and Apple iPhone X, it will be 57.1cm, 64.2cm,
and 57.6cm, respectively. Therefore, to capture a 24" LCD
display that is most commonly seen on the market with smart-
phones, the photograph distance shall usually be larger than
60 cm.

11.3 Summary of Questionnaire Survey
The ﬁrst 3 questions of the questionnaire survey are essay-
content-related choice questions, which are the superﬁcial
tasks of the test. The real aim is to learn whether the partici-
pants feel or notice any visual abnormality during the process
of reading (Question 6). Two transitional questions (Question
4 and 5) are used to cover it up.
No.
