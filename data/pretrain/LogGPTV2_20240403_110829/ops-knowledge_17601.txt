Assistant: At 17-06-09 20:10:58, two tasks (1150 and 1151) were assigned to the executor. The executor then found five blocks (rdd_21_4, rdd_21_1, rdd_21_0, rdd_21_2, and rdd_21_3) locally. The File Output Committer Algorithm version was set to 1 and the PythonRunner reported total, boot, init, and finish times. The output of task 1151 was saved to hdfs and committed. Finally, task 1151 was finished and another task (1155) was assigned to the executor.
