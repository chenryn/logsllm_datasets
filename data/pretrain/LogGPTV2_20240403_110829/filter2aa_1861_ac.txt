Architecture
Initially, and to provide some credibility, each 
bot started off by following some standard 
celebrity and news accounts. We then built up 
a thin veneer of authenticity by populating a 
Word Press blog with pictures of dogs in 
knitted clothes. (This follows the winning bot 
processes). This work using code @AeroFade 
had written to extract images from Flickr 
groups such as this… 
Slide 71 
…a dog wearing a snazzy overcoat… 
Slide 72 
and post them on a wordpress blog as such… 
Slide 73 
New blog post –
Technicolor Dream 
Sweater 
http://whatever/
A wordpress to Twitter plugin would then 
tweet from our social granny bot. Nothing 
groundbreaking, some simple enough to do. 
Slide 74 
Architecture
Next we used the site “If this, then that” to 
comment that the weather was pleasant if it 
reached a certain temperature in a sea side 
town in the UK. 
https://ifttt.com/  
Slide 75 
e.g. if the temperature got over 20C 
Slide 76 
Our bot would tweet… 
Slide 77 
Wonderful, I can switch 
the heating off, it's 21 C 
and Sunny in 
Bournemouth
Like this. 
Slide 78 
Architecture
Interactions.csv
Next, our bot would start following it’s targets, 
recording any interactions (such as follow 
backs) in a simple, timestamped .csv file. 
Following 305 users took some considerable 
time (over 10 days) to not trigger Twitters 
aggressive following alarm. 
At the same time, our social bot began 
Tweeting for a list of Tweets. We used the list 
of Tweets from the winning bot code (to keep 
things fairly standard), but replace references 
to cats with references to dogs.  
@JamesMTitus was a cat fan, our social bots 
liked dogs. 
Tweeted something random 
Slide 79 
Slide 80 
"fracking cops - always in
ma hood stealing ma hos"
We also replaced some Tweets which may have 
been considered misogynistic and replaced 
them with (hopefully) equally frivolous tweets 
such as… 
Slide 81 
I aint tellin’ no lies even a thug lady cries…
… but I show no fears, I cry gangsta tears  
…and… 
Slide 82 
…and…. 
Slide 83 
"My dog is so adorable, I swear he barks 
“Sausages”  How human is your pet?"
…and finally…

Targets.csv
?
Once all targets had been followed, the bot 
would ask each participant an innocuous 
question and record whether there was a 
response. We used broadly the same questions 
as those in the Web Ecology Project. 
Slide 85

Questions
162 questions in total, cycled to cover 305 
users. Examples of questions were….

Slide 92 
…and finally, we added an ELIZA engine to keep 
conversation going. (The Social bots, bot had a 
list of standard replies, we made ours a little 
more context aware). 
ELIZA—a computer program for the study of 
natural language communication between man 
and machine (Weizenbaum, 1966) 
Rogerian psychotherapist  Rogers, Carl (1951). 
"Client-Centered Therapy" Cambridge 
Massachusetts: The Riverside Press. 
Slide 93 
Example Eliza Responses
r’Hello(.*)’
Hey, how is your day going so far?
Here’s one sample exchange… 
Slide 94 
Example Eliza Responses
Interesting!
r’I think(.*)’
lol that's what she said :P
..however, we wanted to retain some of the 
randomness and frivolity from @JamesMTitus, 
so we seeded the Eliza engine with a small 
number of banal responses such as “lol, that’s 
what she said ” 
Slide 95 
Ethics
Now, if you ask anyone researching social bots 
about ethics, you’ll get a similar response.  It’s 
difficult.  A simple tweet could cause someone 
to have a really bad day or worse.  Look at this 
interaction that the social bots winner had 
regarding a deceased cat. 
For this reason, we built a delay into our bots 
response so we could determine if a reply 
would cause offence or not. In practice, we 
didn’t have this problem.

Limitations
• Basic measures of personality 
• Basic social bot
• Each user got a different 
question
• As the experiment progressed, 
each bot had more followers 
and interactions and therefore 
maybe more/less credibility
• No user follow up
Now there were a number of limitations… 
We used basic measures of personality (Ten 
Item Personality Inventory- TIPI & Short Dark 
Triad – SD3) 
Our bot’s we pretty basic. 
Each user got a different question. It may be 
that certain questions elicit a greater response 
rate. 
As the experiment continues, it possible that 
our bots grew in credibility, or vice versa  
And finally, we could not determine whether 
people knew they were interacting with a bot 
or not. 
The intent of our work was to have an 
exploratory investigation into this topic, but 
future studies will likely need to consider these 
limitations.

What did we find?
So, what did we find… 
In the section we’ll focus more on the 
personality traits related to responding, in the 
following section on machine learning, we’ll 
look at features (as, a botmaster would likely 
be looking at features, not personality)

@AeroFade
Us
@AeroFade (the gentleman behind the winning 
bot from the 2011 competition) had nearly a 
40% response rate, where we only achieved 
~20%. 
This could be because @Aerofade’s targets all 
had a common cat interest, or because they 
had support bots, or perhaps their bot was 
more believable.  Perhaps future research can 
investigate different levels of credibility in bots 
and bot detection.   
Slide 104 
Trolling
@User Using no more that 10 
nouns, and ONLY nouns, describe 
yourself
@Sybil facetious **** **** **** **** 
**** **** **** **** annoying
@User How do you feel when you say 
that?
Closely linked to ethics is the issue of 
unintentional trolling (by your social bot).  
Here’s one interaction…. 
Slide 105 
Trolling
@User Cool story bro
@Sybil Shut up, I hope you get 
suspended
@User I’m laughing so hard right now 
ahahaha
…and another.  Our bot clearly not concerned 
with imminent account suspension. 
Slide 106 
@User What do you do for a living?
@User You’re right, and when 
you’re right, you’re right!
@Sybil You’re a bot aren’t you?
@Sybil I plan, guide and help others writing 
software for administrative organizations, and 
conceive the software the orgs need
“Granny failing Turing Test after 1 exchange!” 
Tsk Tsk. The singularity is still a fair way off 
@Sybil
…and finally, we got rumbled once too. It could 
be that we were rumbled immediately and the 
target was trying to smoke us out with an 
elaborate reply, or it could be that our target 
fell for the question and only became aware 
after our social bot tweeted “You’re right, and 
when you’re right, you’re right”.

Extraversion
Y
N
Out of all the personality traits, extraversion 
played the most important part, although the 
significance was very small.  This could be due 
to the small personality test we used or that 
certain aspects of extraversion play a part, 
aspects which not all extraverts share.

Slide 112 
So what?
So what?, While twitter attributes look like 
good candidates for Machine Learning (we’ll 
get to that in a moment), personality also has 
implications.  
Slide 113 
eLearning…
eLearning is ubiquitous in the corporate 
environment, but research suggests that 
learners with higher levels of extraversion 
perform better when they have greater levels 
of control over the learning experience. i.e. it’s 
not a click through exercise.  If social media 
security awareness is proven to be effective, 
then it’s likely that the effectiveness can be 
further improved by tailoring learning based on 
the personality of the learner.

Data Mining & Machine Learning

In this section, I’ll introduce the concept of 
Machine Learning (or Predictive Analytics) with 
objectives of 
• Understanding what data really means 
• Building predictive models 
• Discovering how features interact

It might be reasonable to suggest that non-
responders might get rather frustrated by 
unsolicited requests, so we can assume that 
social bot creators want to avoid hitting these 
people… 
Slide 118 
….as it might ultimately result in account 
suspension. Twitter jail.  From a machine 
learning perspective, we want our bots to avoid 
frustrating the 80% of non-responders (sure, in 
time bots will do better at engaging them, but 
for now we focus on low-hanging fruit).
