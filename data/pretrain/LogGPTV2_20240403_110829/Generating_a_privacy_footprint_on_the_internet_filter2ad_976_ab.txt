We were also interested in the speciﬁc URLs that are re-
trieved most frequently from the hidden nodes. These top-10
URLs are shown in Table 2 and consist of all JavaScript ob-
jects. While we did not speciﬁcally examine the code these
objects contain, such examination would provide insight into
how they work. Using techniques to block these URLs is also
important to alleviate privacy concerns.

3.1 Generating a Privacy Footprint
Thus far, we have shown that both the extent of associ-
ations between visible nodes and the concentration of these
associations via hidden nodes is signiﬁcant. We now sum-
marize these measures on interconnectedness. We generate
a “privacy footprint” intended to not only summarize the
connectivity for a given set of sites, but to be used as a ba-
sis of comparison for diﬀerent results. The footprint needs to
capture the important metrics from the graphs in Figures 1
and 2. The metrics and their justiﬁcation for inclusion in
the footprint are:
1. The number and percentage of visible nodes with an

visible node associations are concentrated amongst a set of
hidden nodes. As an example of this concentration with the
domain approach, Table 1 shows the top-10 hidden nodes in
terms of the number of edges to visible nodes in our graph.
The top domain in the table, doubleclick.net, has edges
to 19% of the visible nodes meaning that a user visiting
a signiﬁcant number of popular sites will likely download
one or more objects from a server in the doubleclick.net
domain. Other results in Table 1 show two separate domains
with the name “google” and domain from Akamai. A CDN
like Akamai is obviously in a position to correlate a range
of sites visited by a user.

Table 1 shows the number of connections with visible
nodes, but it does not accurately capture the cumulative
eﬀect of these connections because some visible nodes have
associations with other visible nodes via more than one hid-
den node. For example, www.cnn.com and online.wsj.com
are associated via both the doubleclick.net and 2o7.net
domains. Figure 2 shows the cumulative count of associ-
ations amongst visible nodes using a rank ordering of the
hidden nodes for the three approaches for handling hidden
nodes. All three results show a strong concentration of asso-
ciations via the top hidden nodes. For example, the top-10

the lists. The nodes in Table 4 are similar to those in Ta-
ble 1 with additions such as yahoo.com, statcounter.com
and imrworldwide.com.
2. The distribution (median, mean, max) of the number
of visible node associations for a given visible nodes.
This metric captures the CCDF of Figure 1 and rep-
resents the depth of the associations—do visible nodes
have relatively few or many associations?
3. The contribution of the top-n rank ordered hidden
nodes to these associations. Based on Figure 2, we
examine the top-10 hidden nodes to understand the
degree of association concentration because of these
nodes.
To illustrate this privacy footprint and how it can be com-
pared with other privacy footprints, we generated the foot-
print with these metrics for the data gathered in April 2006
for the results presented above and for data gathered in Oc-
tober 2005 for previous work [5]. Data gathered each time is
for the same set of sites. The respective privacy footprints
for each timeframe and each approach for merging hidden
nodes are shown in Table 3.

The ﬁrst three lines in Table 3 simply summarize data in
Figures 1 and 2 with the last three lines in the table showing
the same metrics for data gathered six months earlier for the
same set of sites. The results show that while the number
of visible nodes with associations has increased roughly 5%
across the three approaches, the metrics for the number of
associations for a visible node have increased roughly 50%
for the mean indicating a signiﬁcant increase in the associ-
ations via the hidden nodes. The concentration of associa-
tions among the top-10 hidden nodes has increased roughly
20% for the adns and domain merger approaches. The large
increase in these metrics indicates a growing potential to
track and correlate user activity across seemingly unrelated
Web sites on the Internet.
3.2 Global Study
We also examined the use of our privacy footprint for a
much larger and more diverse set of Web sites using the
“Top-100” sites identiﬁed by Alexa for 68 countries and
19 languages around the world [2]. The results indicate
that diﬀusion of potential privacy information is an issue
for users of sites around the world. Table 4 shows hid-
den nodes that appear in at least 15% of the per-country
top-10 hidden node lists for the 68 countries. The most
frequently occurring hidden node in the per-country top-
10 lists is google-analytics.com, which appears in 90% of

3.3 Impact of Cookies
Cookies are a common mechanism for Web sites to main-
tain state during e-commerce transactions or maintain per-
sonalization context for a user. Cookies are also used by
tracking servers to more accurately identify a user as the
user navigates between diﬀerent Web sites.
If pages from
these Web sites cause objects to be retrieved from the same
tracking server and this server has a cookie associated with
it then the server receives this cookie on each retrieval.
Hidden nodes in our study that have cookies associated
with them are particularly troublesome for privacy. To an-
alyze the impact of cookies, we gathered whether or not
cookies are associated with a server during data collection.
This data gathering was done by conﬁguring the browser to
accept all cookies and then to harvest the cookies.txt ﬁle
(maintained by Firefox as part of a user’s proﬁle) after a set
of pages had been retrieved. The text ﬁle contains one line
for each cookie with the server (or domain) as the ﬁrst ﬁeld.
For our analysis, we do not care about cookies set by servers
of the visible nodes nor do we care how many cookies are
set—one cookie suﬃces for privacy leakage.
We used the cookie data to modify our graphs to include
only edges that are connected to hidden nodes that have
cookies associated with them. We then recomputed the pri-
vacy footprint metrics for each of the merger approaches on
the Alexa dataset with results shown in Table 5. For con-
venience, Table 5 repeats the all edges results reported in
the April 2006 results of Table 3. We also drop inclusion of
the server approach as it does not merge all servers of an
organization.
The metrics for edges with cookies in Table 5 are smaller
than comparable metrics where all edges are used, but these
associations all have cookies attached to the object requests.
The top-10 hidden nodes with cookies attached for the do-
main approach are shown in Table 6. These nodes are col-
lectively responsible for connections to 483 distinct visible
nodes as shown in the last column of Table 5. Note the diﬀer-
ence between 483 and the summation of counts in Table 5 is
because visible nodes are associated with other visible nodes
via multiple hidden nodes.
