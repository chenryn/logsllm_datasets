Abstract.  Rogue  employees  with  access  to  sensitive  information  can  easily 
abuse  their  access  to  engage  in  information  theft.  To  help  differentiate  mali-
cious  from  benign  behavior,  this  study  measures  how  participants,  given  a 
common  search  topic,  seek  information.  This  study  uses  double-blind  proce-
dures, a stratified sample, and carefully designed control and experimental con-
ditions. We seek to validate previously identified network indicators (ELICIT), 
find new host-based behaviors, and consider other human attributes that affect 
the  information-use  of  malicious  insiders  by  comparing  their  behavior  to 
equivalent non-malicious users.  
Keywords: insider threat, detection, malicious users, misuse.  
1   Introduction 
Malicious  insiders  who  abuse  their  privileges  to  steal  valuable  information  remain 
largely invisible to current detection methods that rely on rule-breaking behavior. To 
effectively  detect  this  misuse,  one  must  observe  how  trusted  insiders  interact  with 
information and differentiate innocuous from malicious patterns of information-use.  
In  prior  work1,  we  developed  ELICIT,  a  network-based  system  designed  to  help 
analysts detect insiders who operate outside the scope of their duties but within their 
privileges.  The  current  research  uses  the  same  approach,  observing  information-use 
and applying user and information context. This study will evaluate ELICIT’s detec-
tors  across  a  different  participant  pool  while  adding  host-based  monitoring,  and

considering baseline human behavior as well as individual differences in a controlled 
environment. 
Envision a labyrinth where people enter the maze (an information landscape) at dif-
ferent locations (intentions) yet seek the same prize (information). Can one’s path to the 
prize  tell  us  where  they  started  from?  We  hypothesize  that  the  information  gathering 
patterns  of  maliciously  motivated  users  will  differ  in  predictable  ways  from  those  of 
benignly motivated users. For example, malicious insiders may attempt to hide their bad 
behavior  by  interleaving  it  with  separate  innocuous  information  gathering  sessions 
whereas benign users may focus on a single information gathering session.  
2   Methods 
There  will  be  a  minimum  of  50  participants  in  this  study.  They  will  all  be  MITRE 
employees and the sample will be stratified by seniority in the company. 
The experimental procedure is double-blind to guard against bias and placebo ef-
fects. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two conditions: Benign User (con-
trol)  or  Malicious  User.  Participants  are  recruited  under  the  cover  story  that  we  are 
monitoring computer use while testing the latest anti-keylogging software. Deception 
is necessary so they are all unaware that we are studying insider threat behaviors. Par-
ticipants complete a pre-questionnaire asking for biographical data and other behav-
ioral questions of interest.  
Each  participant  receives  a  study  laptop  running  software  that  monitors  their  in-
formation-use behavior. They are randomly assigned one of two scenarios, based on 
their  condition,  explaining  a  role  and  task.  Both  conditions  are  tasked  to  search  the 
MITRE  intranet  and  deliver  the  most  valuable  information  found,  on  an  identical 
topic, onto a CD and are informed that it will be evaluated by subject matter experts 
(creating a performance demand). Each participant is given up to 10 hours to play the 
role  and  complete  the  task  over  a  7  day  period.  Participants  complete  a  post-
questionnaire about their experience, the role, the task, and other behaviors of interest.  
The  two  scenarios  were  designed  to  be  completely  balanced,  except  for  the  ex-
perimental variable—user intent. Both roles describe a person who has fallen on hard 
financial  times  and  must  complete  the  task  in  order  to  improve  their  financial  
situation. In the benign condition, the person joins a high profile team and good per-
formance  on  that  team  will  lead  to  a  promotion  and  pay  increase.  In  the  malicious 
condition,  the  person  accepts  a  new,  higher  paying  job. The  offer  is  conditional  on 
bringing  inside  information  from  his  old  employer  that  would  provide  the  new  em-
ployer a competitive advantage.  
Monitoring  is  done  using  the  network-based  ELICIT  sensors  and  the  host-based 
product  Verdasys’  Digital  Guardian.  Together,  the  sensors  monitor  information-use 
events  including  file/directory  reads,  writes,  moves,  and  deletes.  They  also  monitor 
search engine queries, cut-and-pastes, application launches, and URLs visited. Events 
will be analyzed to measure statistical differences in information usage for each con-
dition.  We  will  apply  previously  determined  ELICIT  indicators  where  appropriate, 
and look for new behavior patterns in network and host activity. Participant responses 
to pre-/post-experiment questionnaires will be analyzed across conditions.
