Subject: Issue with Stopping PyDev Remote Debugger Server

Dear Support Team,

I am currently utilizing the PyDev remote debugger feature for my application. When I attempt to stop the debugger server using the stop button, the console indicates that the server has been successfully terminated. However, it appears that the server is still active and continues to accept new connections on its default port (5678).

Could you please provide guidance on how to reliably stop the server?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
