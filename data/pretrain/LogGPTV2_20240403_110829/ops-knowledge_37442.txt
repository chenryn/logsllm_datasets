What all you need to do is
Steps:

Download and put it two files Python.Runtime.dll and clr.pyd in your DLLs folder.

From you >>>(triple greater than prompt )Python prompt Try
>>>import clr

if it doesn't gives any error you are good to go .

Next You need to do is put Your C++ Dll inside Lib/site-packages Folder .


(This is not mandatory but good for beginners).

Next to import clr try importing your Dll as a module import YourDllName

If step 5 doesn't gives you a error . Hola You are done That's All Folks :)
