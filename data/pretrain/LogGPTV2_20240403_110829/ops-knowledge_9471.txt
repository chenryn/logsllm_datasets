I am new to CentOS and am attempting to develop an application on this platform. My application requires Python 2.7, but the default version on the server is Python 2.6. In my attempt to upgrade, I accidentally deleted the `/usr/bin/python` folder. After reinstalling Python 2.7 using `make install`, I recreated the `/usr/bin/python` directory and ran the command `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python`.

However, after this, when I try to run YUM commands, I encounter the following error:
```
-bash: /usr/bin/yum: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: Permission denied
```

The permissions for the `/usr/bin/python` directory are as follows:
```
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Mar 8 00:19 python
```

It appears that YUM does not work with Python 2.7. To resolve this issue, you should perform the following steps:

1. Open the `/usr/bin/yum` file in a text editor, such as `vim`:
   ```sh
   sudo vim /usr/bin/yum
   ```

2. Change the shebang line from:
   ```sh
   #!/usr/bin/python
   ```
   to:
   ```sh
   #!/usr/bin/python2.6
   ```

3. If Python 2.6 was deleted, you will need to reinstall it. You can do this by downloading and installing the appropriate package. For example, if you have access to a repository, you can use:
   ```sh
   sudo yum install python26
   ```

4. Ensure that the `/usr/bin/yum` script points to the correct Python 2.6 interpreter. This can be done by creating a symbolic link:
   ```sh
   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.6 /usr/bin/python
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to restore the functionality of YUM and ensure that your system uses the correct Python version.
