User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is revealing a PC account user name bad? Typical computers with modern operating systems require log-on accounts with a user name and a password. Is it dangerous to reveal the user name of the log-on account to the public?

My research:
I have found these articles on Information Security Stack Exchange:


Should usernames be kept secret?
How bad is exposing valid user names?
Forgot password and revealing whether account exists


Googling typically gets me back to the first two of these articles.
These answers show that on a website it may be bad to reveal the username for the website account, because it gives malicious users needed information to try to crack an account. The "hacking" is rendered easier because the bad guy already knows where on the internet to try the passwords to crack the website account.

This question pertains to a computer, not a website. The computer may be "hidden" behind a NAT router and theoretically (hopefully?) not directly accessible from the internet. Even if the user has port-forwarded remote-in software, one would have to know the internet address of the computer or the router, of which there's some 4 billion in the IPv4 space, and astronomically more in IPv6. Knowing where to start poking seems a lot harder.

The background:
I help on the Virtualbox forums (forums.virtualbox.org). When folks ask for help with their Virtualbox guests, we usually need a log file from the run of the VB guest where the problem was noticed. These log files contain paths to the files on the host PC that are used by the guest, and these files default to being stored in the user's home path:


Windows: C:\Users{username}....
Linux: /home/{username}/...


The logs therefore reveal the account user name to anyone who may download the log file. And everyone including non-authenticated visitors, can download log files. Some users obfuscate these path names because they feel that having their user names out on the web is bad.

Are they right? Is revealing the PC account user name bad?

Assistant: I guess no. Why? Because if you secure your environment in such way that it can eliminate bruteforce attacks/dictionary attacks or any other attack that is trying to force the login, then exposing usernames won't do anything to it, thereafter you can limit the attempts in your LSP. If you look more into the psych of a possible attack, they can generate strings that are based on your username for example username is am123, they can put ham123 or aM93 in their dict list).

Should i keep my username of roastedbeans.ru secret? Yeah you should because it's not your environment, you do not manage it. Therefore you do not know if it is secure at all.
