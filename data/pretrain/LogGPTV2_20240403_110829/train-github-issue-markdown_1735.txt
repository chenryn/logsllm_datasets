### Keyboard Manager Functionality

The Keyboard Manager allows you to remap individual keys or key combinations, providing a high degree of customization. Here are some examples of how you can use this feature:

1. **Remapping Key Combinations:**
   - You can map the `[Fn] + [Right Arrow]` key combination to the `End` key.
   - Similarly, you can map the `[Fn] + [Left Arrow]` key combination to the `Home` key.

2. **Creating Custom Shortcuts:**
   - You can also create custom shortcuts using the `Function` (Fn) key. For example:
     - `[Fn] + M` can be set to open Minecraft.

The possibilities for customization are extensive and can greatly enhance your productivity and convenience.
