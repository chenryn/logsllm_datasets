> [!NOTE]
> In the Azure portal, the *Metrics* and *Insights* pages display raw metrics data stored in Azure Monitor. The queries on these pages directly access the raw data to ensure the most accurate results.

When using the diagnostics settings feature, you can migrate the raw metrics data to a Log Analytics workspace. During this migration, some data precision may be lost due to rounding, which can result in slight variations between the query results and the original data. The margin for error is typically less than one percent.
