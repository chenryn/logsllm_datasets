Zero-Knowledge Arguments of Knowledge
In this paper the common reference string will always
be a public key for the Pedersen commitment scheme.
We will consider arguments consisting of three inter-
active algorithms pK,P,Vq, all running in probabilistic
polynomial time. These are the common reference string
generator K, the prover P, and the veriﬁer V. On input
1λ, algorithm K produces a common reference string σ.
The transcript produced by P and V when interacting on
inputs s and t is denoted by tr Ð xPpsq,Vptqy. We write
xPpsq,Vptqy “ b depending on whether the veriﬁer rejects,
b “ 0, or accepts, b “ 1.
Let R Ă t0, 1u˚ ˆ t0, 1u˚ ˆ t0, 1u˚ be a polynomial-
time-decidable ternary relation. Given σ, we call w a witness
for a statement u if pσ, u, wq P R, and deﬁne the CRS-
dependent language
Lσ “ tx | Dw : pσ, x, wq P Ru
as the set of statements x that have a witness w in the
relation R.
