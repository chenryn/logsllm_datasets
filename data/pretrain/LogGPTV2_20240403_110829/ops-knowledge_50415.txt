**Subject: Running Long Python Scripts on SSH Without Disconnection Issues**

Hi,

I need to run a Python script that takes several hours to complete. However, my computer disconnects from the SSH session after a certain period of inactivity.

I have tried running the script with the following command:
```bash
python test.py > output.txt &
```
However, the `output.txt` file remains empty. Despite this, the Python script `test.py` continues to run even after I log off and log back into the SSH session.

I also attempted to use:
```bash
python -u test.py > output.txt &
```
This command does write to `output.txt`, but it stops writing once the SSH connection is lost.

I am new to Linux and not very familiar with many commands. Could you please suggest the simplest and easiest-to-understand method to ensure my script runs to completion and writes to the output file, even if the SSH connection is lost?

Thank you!

**Response:**

You can use the `nohup` command, which suppresses the SIGHUP (hangup) signal when your SSH session disconnects. This will allow your script to continue running in the background. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```bash
nohup python -u test.py > output.txt 2>&1 &
```

- `nohup` ensures that the script continues to run even if the SSH session is terminated.
- `python -u test.py` runs your Python script with unbuffered output.
- `> output.txt` redirects the standard output to `output.txt`.
- `2>&1` redirects the standard error to the same file as the standard output.
- `&` runs the command in the background.

This should solve your issue and ensure that your script runs to completion and writes to the `output.txt` file.

If you need more advanced session management, you can also consider using `screen` or `tmux`. These tools allow you to create persistent terminal sessions that you can detach and reattach to, even after an SSH disconnection.

Let me know if you need further assistance!
