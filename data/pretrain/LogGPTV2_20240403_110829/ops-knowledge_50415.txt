User: I need to run a python code that takes several hours and my computer disconnects from the ssh after a certain amount of inactive time. 
I have tried python  test.py > output.txt & but my output file is empty. However, the python code "test" is still running after I log off and log back in to the ssh. I also tried python -u test.py > output.txt &  which does write to the output.txt but it does not continue after the ssh connection is lost. 
I am very new to Linux so I do not know very many commands. I need the simplest/easiest to understand method. 
Thanks!
Assistant: You can use screen, as Robin Krahl recommended, or you can just run your command with nohup, which suppresses the SIGHUP (hangup) signal from your SSH session disconnecting.
nohup "python -u test.py > output.txt" &
