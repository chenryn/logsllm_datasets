Fig. 1. Sequence diagram of the experiment using WebLAR tool in MONROE mea-
surement platform.
When the container begins running the WebLAR experiment, WebLAR starts
by checking the available network interfaces that have cellular connectivity and
changes the default gateway (#3) to one of the available interfaces to fetch the
webpages. Then, the node immediately starts capturing the metadata informa-
tion and simultaneously runs the Google Chrome browser (version 62) using
Chromedriver (version 2.33) (#4 and #5). The Google Chrome browser starts
in Incognito and maximized mode and with no-sandbox option. The browser
issues HTTP[S] GET request to the given URL. When the browser starts down-
loading the webpage a video of the browsing session progress is captured for
30 s. Moreover, we capture the web QoS and complexity metrics of the webpage
(#6) by using the browser timing information. At the same time, the ATF time
is approximated using the timing information retrieved using the browser API.
Once the browsing session is completed the recorded video is converted into a
series of screenshots (bitmap images) in every 100 ms interval and the ATF time
is calculated by comparing the pixel changes within the consecutive screenshots
(#7). Then we stop capturing the metadata (#8) and send the results annotated
with the metadata to the MONROE back-end. In one experiment submission,
the steps from #3 to #8 may repeat depending on the number of cellular connec-
tivity that the node has and the number of the webpages that the user wishes to
measure. Finally, the user can retrieve the results from the MONROE back-end
and can do analysis.

Implementation
The Pixel-Wise Comparison Approach: We designed a Java program that
records a video (10 frames per second) of the browsing session on a predeﬁned
Measuring Web Quality of Experience in Cellular Networks

screen size. Then by using ffmpeg [23], the video is converted into bitmap images
in 100 ms interval. imagemagic [1] is used to compare the pixel diﬀerence between
consecutive images. Then we utilise a python script [9] to determine the ATFp
time from the pixel diﬀerences. The ATFp time is the point where there are
no more pixel changes in consecutive X screenshots (i.e., X/10 s threshold). A
study [21] in 2016 shows the average PLT in 4G connection is 14 s. The study
shows that more than half of the mobile users abandon the sites that take longer
than three seconds to load. The study revealed that 75% of the mobile sites take
longer than ten seconds to load. In the WebLAR experiment, we set three thresh-
olds (3, 10 and 14 s) for declaring whether or not the webpage stabilizes. Hence,
the ATFp time is approximated with diﬀerent webpage stabilizing thresholds.
Browser Heuristic-Based Approach: We used the Google Chrome browser
API and utilized the performance timing information to approximate ATFb time
using the browser’s heuristic. First we detect all the resources of the website
and their location on the webpage. Then, to approximate the ATFb time, we
integrate the download time of the images (that are located in the ATF area),
javascript ﬁles, cascaded style sheet ﬁles, and the root document that contains
the DOM structure of the webpage. Moreover, using the browser API, the QoS
metrics such as the DNS lookup time, TCP connect time, TTFB, the DOM
load time and PLT are captured. The web complexity metrics such as number
and size of resources are also extracted using the API. We wrote a javascript
implementation to approximate the ATFb time and integrated it within the Java
program used to approximate the ATFp time.
3 Analysis
We begin by presenting the dataset (Sect. 3.1) we collected after deploying
WebLAR on the MONROE platform. We present the analysis using this dataset,
focussing on IP path lengths (Sect. 3.2), web latency and QoE (Sect. 3.3) and
speciﬁcally QoE under mobility (Sect. 3.4) conditions.
3.1 Dataset
We ran the WebLAR experiment for two weeks (May 19–26, 2018 and July 2–
9, 2018) in 128 MONROE nodes located in Norway and Sweden. The nodes
are equipped with one or two SIM cards with 4G connectivity. Nine of the
nodes deployed in Norway are connected with a Swedish operator roaming [29]
in Norway. Our measurement campaign covers a total of six operators. During
the campaign, nodes are set to fetch speciﬁc pages of eight popular websites
(Appendix A). The WebLAR experiment execute every six hours. In the rest
of this paper, we refer to the websites with the name of their base URL. We
performed pre-processing to prune out results where the experiment failed to
report values of all metrics (e.g., due to browser timeout settings) leaving us
with ∼18K data points.

IP Path Lengths
We began by analysing the IP paths towards the measured websites. WebLAR
uses traceroute to measure the IP path length and the round trip time towards
the websites. To study the IP path length and the latency diﬀerence in LTE and
ﬁxed-line networks, we ran WebLAR on 29 MONROE nodes in Italy, Norway,
Spain, and Sweden. Figure 2(1) shows the IP path length towards selected web-
sites in ﬁxed-line and LTE networks from 29 MONROE nodes. The result shows
that in the median case, the IP path length in LTE and ﬁxed-line network is
similar.

and LTE broadband networks as observed from selected 29 nodes.
3.3 Web Latency and QoE
Figure 2(2) shows the latency towards the websites from ﬁxed-line and LTE net-
works from 29 MONROE nodes. We observe that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the DNS lookup time and PLT (not shown) of the websites from ﬁxed-line and
LTE network. However, the TCP connect time and TTFB of the websites are
shorter in ﬁxed-line network. For instance, in the median case, in LTE network
the TCP connect time, and TTFB are respectively, 160% and 30% longer than
that observed in ﬁxed-line networks. Due to security reason, the browser timing
API gives the same value for the start and end of the TCP connect and DNS
lookup time for cross-origin resources. That is, unless the user explicitly allows
the server to share these values, by default the TCP connect time and DNS
lookup time is 0 for the cross-origin resources [30]. As a result, three websites
(Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo) report 0 for these metrics. The discussion of the
DNS lookup time and TCP connect time does not include these three websites.
Figure 3(1) shows the latency of the websites under diﬀerent MNOs. Note, the
Norwegian and Swedish operators are labeled with NO o and SE o, respectively,
Measuring Web Quality of Experience in Cellular Networks
25
where o ∈ {1, 2, 3}. SE r refers to a Swedish operator roaming in Norway. The
result shows the MNOs have diﬀerent performance in terms of DNS lookup time
(ranges from 35 ms to 60 ms, in the median case) and TCP connect time (ranges
from 100 ms to 200 ms, in the median). One of the causes for the variation in the
DNS lookup time across the MNOs could be attributed to the presence of cached
DNS entries [36]. The result also shows that, the diﬀerence in TTFB and PLT
of the websites across diﬀerent MNOs is not high (i.e., in the median case, only
200 ms to 600 ms diﬀerence in PLT). We applied Kolmogorov - Smirnov test to
investigate the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence in PLT across MNOs. In most of the
cases, we found a smaller p-value (below 0.05) between the PLT of the websites
across MNOs. This conﬁrms that there is a diﬀerence in PLT of the websites
across MNOs. We also found a higher p-value between PLT across MNOs within
the same country (e.g., 0.46 between NO 2 and NO 2, 0.4 between SE 1 and
SE 3). This observation indicates that MNOs within the same country exhibit
similar PLT towards these websites. The result also shows that there is up to 1 s
improvement in the PLT compared with a previous [21] observations.

and (2) ATF time as approximated using the two approaches.
Figure 3(2) shows the distribution of the ATF time towards websites across
diﬀerent MNOs as approximated using the two approaches. Figure 3 (2, top)
shows the approximated ATFb time. The long tails of the distribution in this
result is due to Facebook and BBC, which have higher number of objects and
overlapping images in the above-the-fold area. Figure 3 (2, bottom 3) show the
ATFp with three, ten and 14 s threshold, respectively. From the result, we can
see that in the median case, the ATFb is shorter than the ATFp time with three
seconds threshold. This indicates that three seconds is a suﬃcient threshold to
declare whether the website has stabilized or not. As such, going forward, we
only consider three seconds threshold for approximating the ATF time using the
pixel-wise comparison approach. The diﬀerence in the ATF time of the websites
across most of the MNOs is small (i.e., in the median case, the diﬀerence is
100 ms to 300 ms). However, we notice that the diﬀerence in ATF time between
SE r and the other MNOs is large (i.e., in the median case, ATFb time can be
26

up to 400 ms and ATFp time can be up to 4200 ms). By applying a Kolmogorov
- Smirnov test, we found a smaller p-value (below 0.05) between the ATFb time
of the diﬀerent MNOs. This conﬁrms that there is a diﬀerence between ATFb
times across MNOs. Only the ATFb time of websites between SE 1 and SE 3
shows a p-value of 0.75, highlighting similar QoE between the two MNOs.

ATF time of Yahoo across diﬀerent MNOs.
We also analysed the rendering performance of each website. Figure 4(1)
shows the distribution of the ATF time approximated using the two approaches
and the PLT of the websites. Through manual inspection, we observed that some
of the websites, e.g., Microsoft, have a fewer number of objects and take shorter
time to show the contents of the above-the-fold area. The ATF approximation
using both approaches conﬁrms this. On the contrary, websites like Facebook
have multiple objects located in the above-the-fold area (conﬁrmed through man-
ual inspection). The objects may overlap each other where some of the objects
may not be visible in the front unless the user takes further action (e.g., clicking
the sliding button). In such cases, the browser heuristic based ATF time approx-
imation overestimates the ATF time. Hence, for these kinds of websites, the ATF
time approximation based on the browser heuristic does not better represent the
end user experience. That is, the missing or delay in the download of those over-
lapped objects do not have eﬀect in the visual change of the websites. Therefore,
for the websites that have overlapping objects in the above-the-fold area, the
ATF time needs to be approximated in a diﬀerent way. For instance, Fig. 4(1)
shows that the ATFp time of Facebook is below half of its PLT, which is much
shorter than its ATFb time. This shows that the pixel-wise comparison approach
of ATF time approximation is better for websites that have overlapping contents.
However, approximating the ATF time using the pixel-wise comparison approach
may also overestimate the ATF time for some websites. For instance, Microsoft
has fewer images in the above-the-fold area, and the ATFb time is short. How-
ever, the visual look of the webpage seems to be manipulated by using css and

javascripts and have animating contents. As a result, the pixel-wise comparison
approach yields longer ATF time for this website. Therefore, the design of the
website can have an impact on the two ATF time approximation methods. Fur-
thermore, due to the design pattern adopted by some websites, the objects are
fetched asynchronously and the TCP connection may not be closed. As such,
the javascript onLoad event may ﬁre before all the objects are fetched. In such
cases, the ATFb time is longer than that of the PLT.
Figure 4(1) also shows that the ATF time of BBC, Yahoo and Wikipedia
exhibits a bimodal distribution. We investigated this aspect further by observing
the ATF time of these websites from diﬀerent operators. For instance, Fig. 4(2)
shows the distribution of the ATF time of Yahoo across the diﬀerent MNOs
approximated using the two approaches. The result reveals that in the Norwegian
MNOs, Yahoo takes longer to show the contents in the above-the-fold area. As
such, the bimodal distribution of ATF time is due to the diﬀerence observed in
the operators across diﬀerent country. The impact of the longer download time
of the objects in the above-the-fold area is reﬂected in the ATFp time of the
websites. For the other two websites we see a diﬀerence across the operators. That
is, the bimodal distribution happens in all operators. Figure 4(2) and 3(1) also
show that the Swedish operator roaming in Norway has a similar QoE with the
native Swedish operator. As such, the home-routed roaming [29] conﬁguration
does not have much impact on the QoE when the user travels relatively small
distances (i.e., between Norway and Sweden).

3.4 Web QoE Under Mobility Conditions
Figure 5(1) shows the distribution of the ATF time of the websites under mobility
scenario as approximated using the two methods. The results show that ATF
time of the websites measured from nodes deployed in trains and buses are similar
to that of the nodes deployed in homes and oﬃces. However, the variation in
ATF time across diﬀerent MNOs is relatively higher under mobility scenario.
The nodes deployed in trains can be online even though the trains are at
the garage; hence some nodes may not be moving in some cases. Figure 5(2)
