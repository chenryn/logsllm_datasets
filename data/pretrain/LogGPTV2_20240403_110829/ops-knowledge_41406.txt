User: I am programming a django based website. I actually use a small computer under Ubuntu 10.04.
I would like to buy something more professional, so I am wondering whether an iMac is good for that, because :

Is there a free IDE as good as eclipse on MacOS ?
Is there a remote python debugger like pydev for eclipse ?
Is there some typical issues with python on MacOS ?
does apache+mod_wsgi works well on MacOS ?
Assistant: Why do you consider iMac to be more or less professional than anything else? Hardware? System?
Note: I'm myself a MacOSX and Linux user.
Unless it's a requisite, most times I'd say it's only a matter of personal taste.
As said by others earlier, everything you cited works fine on MacOSX.
However, you should consider the 3rd party libraries you're going to use with Python.
I would cite a problem I had with MySQLdb (MySQL-python) on MacOSX, but it has been solved. You might face other problems in the way, but nothing that could stop you from using Django, Eclipse, etc.
