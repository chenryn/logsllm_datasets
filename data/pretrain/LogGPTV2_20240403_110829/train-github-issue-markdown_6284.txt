I was thinking about recommending Atom to a friend, and I went to the
https://atom.io/ to see if there were Windows builds. The site saw I was on
Linux, showed me the .deb and .rpm links, and a link for "Other platforms".
That page contained this text:
> Prebuilt versions of Atom are available for OS X 10.8 or later, Windows 7 &
> 8, RedHat Linux, and Ubuntu Linux.
but doesn't link to them or really inspire confidence that they do exist
somewhere. It seems like I'd be out of luck if I wanted to save one of their
installers to a flash drive to install on another computer offline.
