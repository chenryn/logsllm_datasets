of clients, and a portion of them are visiting sensitive pages. He
wants to pick these clients out of the larger group as candidates
for further action, such as to identify members of a compromising
website or specific interest groups. Results of WF in the selection
scenario can allow him to decide where to apply more powerful but
resource-limited surveillance techniques, such as zero-day malware,
phone tapping, or electromagnetic monitoring.
We define the scenario as follows. 𝑆 clients visit 𝐾 pages each,
among which 𝑁 clients (“sensitive clients”) have visited a sensitive
page 𝑀 times each. The other 𝑆 − 𝑁 clients do not visit the sensitive
page. The eavesdropper wants to select 𝑁 ′ clients that are visiting
sensitive pages. To do so, he uses WF to classify all page visits, and
selects the 𝑁 ′ clients that have visited the most pages.
Analysis
We examine a setting with 𝑆 = 1000 clients among which 𝑁 = 30
clients visit sensitive pages. The attacker observes 𝐾 = 2000 page
visits for each client in total, and the sensitive clients visits 𝑀 = 60
sensitive pages. The attacker attempts to guess who they are by
selecting the top 𝑁 ′ = 𝑁 = 30 clients by sensitive page access
count, where the count is determined by the classifier. Setting the
number of actual sensitive clients to be the same as the attacker’s
number of selections allows us to simplify the analysis by using a
single accuracy value to measure success, and it gives the attacker
the hardest possible task without making it inherently impossible.
Figure 4: Selection scenario: Success rate (percentage of sen-
sitive clients correctly identified) using kFP against four de-
fenses for 𝑀 = 30, 𝑁 = 30, 𝑆 = 1000 and 𝐾 = 2000, varying the
confidence limit for a TPR/FPR tradeoff. 0.5 confidence is
equivalent to no tradeoff (maximum TPR).
(The attacker does not need to know 𝑁 .) As 3% of clients are visiting
a sensitive page 3% of the time, overall, clients are only visiting the
sensitive page at a very low base rate of 0.09% — below the lowest
base rate examined in previous work [17]. We set a low base rate
so that the scenario is difficult for the attacker, in order to show
that defenses still do not succeed in this scenario.
We show the attacker’s success rate, defined as the percentage of
sensitive clients correctly identified as such, against four defenses
in Figure 4. The lines show how a TPR/FPR trade-off by increasing
the confidence limit would increase the success rate. Indeed, each
attack sees an increase in success rate due to the trade off: WTF-PAD
(100% → 100%), Decoy (76% → 100%), Front (84% → 100%), but
not so much for Tamaraw (53% → 59%). It is also disadvantageous
to increase the confidence limit too much, which would cause the
success rate to drop due to low accuracy.
The TPR/FPR trade-off is useful for this scenario because the FPR
is a stronger determinant of attacker success than TPR (in terms
of absolute value). An attacker achieving 90% TPR and 5% FPR has
the same success rate of 97.7% as an attacker achieving 80% TPR
and 3.9% FPR. Interestingly, we found that the Tamaraw attacker
does not benefit much from a TPR/FPR tradeoff, even though his
FPR against Tamaraw was 20% (much higher than the base rate).
Without a TPR/FPR trade-off, the attacker is still decently successful
while incurring a much higher FPR against these defenses than the
base rate.
Concentration of base rate
Specifically, it is noteworthy that the eavesdropper can achieve
a high success rate with a relatively high FPR compared to the base
rate; a 5% FPR would be more than 50 times the base rate. This
may seem contrary to the standard laboratory scenario in which a
classifier fails when its FPR far exceeds the base rate: this is because,
in our scenario, the classifier’s goal is not to identify all page visits,
but rather to distinguish between a small group with 3% base rate
and a large group with 0% base rate. (Here we refer to the former
as the specific base rate.) Members of the small group are selected
based on their perceived number of sensitive actions by the attacker,
and so both a high TPR and a low FPR are important.

TPR, 10% FPR), while varying 𝑁 (the number of sensitive
clients), and keeping 𝑀 (the number of sensitive pages each
sensitive client visits) at 𝑀 = 1800/𝑁 to hold the overall base
rate constant at 0.09%. The attacker makes 𝐾 = 2000 observa-
tions of page visits on 𝑆 = 1000 total clients.
We examine the effect of the specific base rate in the following.
Fixing the TPR at 91% and FPR at 10% (similar to Decoy), we compute
the attacker’s performance in selecting 𝑁 clients visiting 1800/𝑁
sensitive pages, varying 𝑁 , out of a group of 1000 clients.2 This
fixes the overall base rate at 0.09% while varying the specific base
rate of the group to be selected. We show the results in Figure 5,
where we see that the specific base rate has a powerful effect on the
success rate of the attacker, ranging from above 98% below 𝑁 = 20
(4.5% specific base rate) down to 35% at 𝑁 = 100 (0.45% specific
base rate). A larger specific base rate means fewer sensitive clients,
but they visit the sensitive page more frequently. There is a large
slide in success rate between 𝑁 = 20 and 𝑁 = 50. (Note that as 𝑁
increases to 150, the random chance of guessing a sensitive client
correctly increases linearly to 15%, so the success rate with high 𝑁
is partly due to random guesses.)
This adds a previously unaddressed factor to the discussion of
how the base rate affects the attacker — whether sensitive accesses
are concentrated in a few clients or spread among many. Even
if the two cases have the same overall base rate, it is far easier
for the attacker to detect sensitive clients in the former case. One
implication is that clients who only visit sensitive pages with Tor
place themselves at greater risk of being selected with WF; clients
who use Tor for both sensitive and non-sensitive activities are not
as easily detected.
We note that this scenario does not necessarily assume that there
are only two groups, one with a high base rate and one with a zero
base rate. This is because the attacker’s success rate on each group
is independent of the existence of other groups. When there are
multiple groups with different base rates, the attacker’s success rate
can be separately derived on each group.
If we had increased 𝑁 without decreasing 𝑀 (causing an overall
increase in base rate), the attacker’s success rate would increase
slightly, from 84% at 𝑁 = 30 to 90% at 𝑁 = 100. While the attacker
would need to identify more clients, the overall task is easier as
more clients are sensitive. In fact, the increase in success rate is
almost identical to the increase in the random guessing success rate
2If 1800/𝑁 is not an integer, the client randomly chooses between ⌊1800/𝑁 ⌋ and
⌈1800/𝑁 ⌉ so that it averages to 1800/𝑁 .

(90% TPR, 20% FPR) while varying 𝐾, the number of page
accesses observed, and keeping 𝑀 = 0.03𝐾 to hold the base
rate constant.
(from 3% at 𝑁 = 30 to 10% at 𝑁 = 100). This shows that the value
of 𝑁 by itself does not explain the above result; it is indeed due to
the concentration of base rate.
The benefit of more observations
Another interesting factor determining the attacker’s success
in this scenario is the total number of observations the attacker
makes. If the attacker can monitor the client for a longer period of
time (collecting more page accesses), he will naturally be able to
classify the client more accurately.
We examine this effect in Figure 6, where we scale up 𝐾 and
𝑀 proportionally while keeping the specific base rate of sensitive
clients the same at 3%, based on our attack’s TPR/FPR against
Tamaraw, the strongest defense. We see the effect of 𝐾 on the
success rate is drastic: from a success rate of 34% when 𝐾 = 1000,
the attacker’s success rate increases beyond 98% above 𝐾 = 10000.
On the other hand, if the attacker could only observe 𝐾 = 100
accesses (i.e. only 𝑀 = 3 sensitive accesses), the success rate is only
7%. The long-lived guard policy of Tor implies that Tor guards can
practically collect large numbers of traces on clients connecting to
them, as they would have observation periods lasting months.3
4.2 Identification scenario
We flip around the selection scenario to consider an attacker that
wants to make a single yes/no decision on whether or not a spe-
cific client has been visiting sensitive pages. In the identification
scenario, the eavesdropper has been monitoring the client for a
long time, and has collected some traces each corresponding to a
single page access. The eavesdropper wants to know if the client
has visited certain sensitive sites, such as sites of a specific political
ideology, whistleblowing sites, or online marketplaces. Identifying
the client this way may give the eavesdropper sensitive targeting
information for purposes of surveillance, recruitment, harassment
or ostracization. Out of 𝐾 pages, the client has either visited 𝑀 mon-
itored pages, or has visited 0 monitored pages. The eavesdropper
faces a yes/no decision problem on whether or not the client has
3If Tor guards were short-lived, it would take them longer to collect as many traces
on their clients depending on their share of the global guard bandwidth; however,
they would be able to do so for a greater number of clients over time, so we are not
necessarily recommending a short-lived guard policy.

a client can visit before an attacker has a high likelihood
(𝑇 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑 > 0.9, 𝐹 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑  𝐿) is given by the binomial distribution of 𝐾 trials
with success rate 𝐹 𝑃𝑅; it is one minus the CDF up to 𝑥 = 𝐿. For
a sensitive client who visits 𝑀 monitored pages, 𝑃𝑟(𝑥′
𝑚𝑜𝑛 > 𝐿) is
given by the sum of two binomial distributions, where there are
𝑀 trials of success rate 𝑇 𝑃𝑅 and 𝐾 − 𝑀 trials of success rate 𝐹 𝑃𝑅.
The eavesdropper decides that the client is one to visit monitored
sites if he observes more than 𝐿 visits. Therefore, 𝑃𝑟(𝑥𝑚𝑜𝑛 > 𝐿) is
the attacker’s false positive rate (𝐹 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑) and 𝑃𝑟(𝑥′
𝑚𝑜𝑛 > 𝐿) is the
attacker’s true positive rate (𝑇 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑) in the identification scenario.
Based on an attack with 90% TPR and 20% FPR (similar to Tama-
raw) that can observe 1000 page accesses for the client, we chart a
range of 𝑇 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑 and 𝐹 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑 values by varying 𝐿 in Figure 7. We see
that this attack would perform poorly against a 𝑀 = 10 (1% base
rate) client, but it would perform well against a 𝑀 = 50 (5% base
rate) client, even though the FPR of the underlying attack is 20%.
At 𝑀 = 50, the attacker can identify 67% of sensitive clients while
mis-identifying 1% of non-sensitive clients. At 𝑀 = 100, 𝑇 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑 rises
to 97% while 𝐹 𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑑 drops to 0.1%.
Just as we had observed for the selection scenario, the distribu-
tion of base rate among clients would also affect our results. We
found that in the above setting, if 10% of clients visited the sensitive
page 1% of the time, we could identify 51% of sensitive clients while
mis-identifying 30% of non-sensitive clients as sensitive; a poor
result. But if 1% of clients visited the page 10% of the time, we could
identify 96% of these clients while mis-identifying less than 0.01%
of non-sensitive clients.
While the results are dependent on 𝑀 and 𝐿, an attacker does
not need to know 𝑀 to set 𝐿; he can do so based on his knowledge
of his classifier’s FPR by setting 𝐿 to be comfortably higher than
the FPR times 𝐾.
