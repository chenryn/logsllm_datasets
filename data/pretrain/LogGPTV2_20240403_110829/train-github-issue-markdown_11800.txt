## Expected Behavior
It is possible to override styles of `Popover` inside `Menu`.
## Current Behavior
It is not possible to override styles of `Popover` inside `Menu`.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
N/A
## Context
`Menu` intercepts `classes` prop, so it is not passed to `Popover` component
along with `...other` props.  
My suggestion would be adding `PopoverProps`, which then can be used to pass
`classes` prop to `Popover` (like it is implemented in Drawer).  
I can submit a PR if you are OK with this solution
