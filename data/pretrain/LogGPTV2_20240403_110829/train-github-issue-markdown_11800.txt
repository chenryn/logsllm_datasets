### Issue Report

#### I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
It should be possible to override the styles of the `Popover` component when it is used inside a `Menu`.

#### Current Behavior
Currently, it is not possible to override the styles of the `Popover` component when it is used inside a `Menu`.

#### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
N/A

#### Context
The `Menu` component intercepts the `classes` prop, preventing it from being passed to the `Popover` component along with other props. 

My suggestion is to add a `PopoverProps` prop to the `Menu` component, which can then be used to pass the `classes` prop (and potentially other props) to the `Popover`. This approach is similar to how it is implemented in the `Drawer` component.

I am willing to submit a pull request (PR) if this solution is acceptable.
