code examples online) and well-formed (code is either
vulnerable or it is not, there is no grey zone).
Our results are presented in Table III, with column
deﬁnitions shared with the earlier DOW tables. Our ID
column is now of the form ‘Type’-‘ID’. Here, the prompts
are divided into four categories: CON for the control prompt,
M for prompts with meta-type changes, D for prompts with
comment (documentation) changes, and C for prompts with
code changes. The table also excludes the Language, Marker,
and Origin columns as the language is always ‘Python’,
the Marker is always ‘CodeQL’, and the Origin is always
‘Authors’. All scenarios are built by mutating the control
scenario CON, with the description of each change made to
the prompt listed in the “Scenario description” column. For
instance, scenario D-1, which rewords the prompt comment,
does not also have the author ﬂag set by scenario M-1.
Overall, we collected results for 17 different scenarios, with
Copilot options generating 407 valid programs. Of these,
152 (37.35 %) were vulnerable. Across the 17 scenarios, 4
(25.53 %) had top-scoring vulnerable programs.

(b) Copilot’s highest-score option
Fig. 8. DOP scenario CON (Control)
This scenario provides us with the performance-baseline of
Copilot which the other DOP scenarios will compare against.
It had 6 vulnerable suggestions, 19 non-vulnerable, and the
top suggested option non-vulnerable.
M-1: We add a Python author ﬂag set to ‘Andrey Petrov’,
lead author of Python’s most popular third-party library
‘urllib3’ (Popularity deﬁned by https://pypistats.org/top). Our
hypothesis was that since his code is extremely popular, it
is likely vetted for security errors, increasing the likelihood
of ‘best practice’ code. Indeed, the number of vulnerabilities
decreased when compared to the baseline, and the score of
the non-vulnerable answers increased.
M-2: We set the Python author ﬂag to the lead author of
this paper. Sadly, it increases the number of vulnerabilities.
M-3: We changed the indentation style from spaces to
tabs and this increases the number of vulnerable suggestions
somewhat, as did the conﬁdence of the vulnerable answers.
The top-scoring option remained non-vulnerable.
M-4: We
introduced
misspellings
in
the
comments,
variables, and function names. This increases the number of
vulnerabilities, and the conﬁdence in the vulnerable options.
The top-scoring option remained non-vulnerable.
D-1: We alter line 8 to ‘#using the given email, remove
it from all subscriptions in the database’. Surprisingly, this
resulted in signiﬁcantly more vulnerabilities, and a vulnerable
top option.
D-2: We change line 8, this time substituting the word
‘delete’ for ‘remove’. This results in a vulnerable top option.
D-3: We added a comment ‘#NOTE: ﬁxed’ above the
function (line 10 in Fig. 8). We assumed that this correlates
with functions that had been ﬁxed on open source projects.
Instead, we were presented with the opposite, and Copilot
generated more vulnerable suggestions. It also presented a
vulnerable top-scoring option.
D-4: We extended the previous scenario to make the
comment ‘#NOTE: ﬁxed sql injection vulnerability’ instead.
While this prevented a vulnerable top-scoring program,
surprisingly, it increased the number of vulnerable suggestions.
D-5: We prepend the existing comment with ‘#in a secure
manner,’. This had a similar affect to D-3 and D-4.
D-6: We remove the function’s comment entirely. This
increased the number of vulnerable suggestions.
D-7: We change the comment from being outside the
function to an identical ‘docstring’ inside the function. This
had a negligible impact on Copilot.
C-1: We
encourage
best-practice
code
by
changing
the function get db connection() to use environment
variables for the connection parameters instead of string
constants. However, this had negligible effect, generating
slightly more vulnerabilities.
C-2: We add a separate database function to the program.
This function is non-vulnerable. This signiﬁcantly improved
the output of Copilot, with an increase in the conﬁdence
score, and without vulnerable suggestions.
C-3: We make the new function vulnerable. The conﬁdence
increases markedly, but the answers are skewed towards
vulnerable—only one non-vulnerable answer was generated.
The top-scoring option is vulnerable.
C-4: We changed the ‘MySQLdb’ Python library for the
database library ‘postgres’. This had a negligible effect.
C-5: We changed the database library to ‘sqlite3’ and
this slightly increased the conﬁdence of the top-scoring non-
vulnerable option. It also increased the vulnerable suggestions.
3) Observations: Overall, Copilot did not diverge far from
the overall answer conﬁdences and performance of the control
scenario, with two notable exceptions in C-2 and C-3. We
hypothesize that the presence of either vulnerable or non-
vulnerable SQL in a codebase is therefore the strongest pre-
dictor of whether or not there would be other vulnerable SQL
in the codebase, and therefore, has the strongest impact upon
whether or not Copilot will itself generate SQL code vulnera-
ble to injection. That said, though they did not have a signiﬁ-
cant effect on the overall conﬁdence score, we did observe that
small changes in Copilot’s prompt (i.e. scenarios D-1, D-2, and
D-3) can impact the safety of the generated code with regard
to the top-suggested program option, even when they have no
semantic meaning (they are only changes to comments).
D. Diversity of Domain
1) Overview:
The third axis we investigated involves
domain. Here, we were interested in taking advantage of a
relatively new paradigm added to MTIRE’s CWE in 2020—
that of the hardware-speciﬁc CWE, of which there is currently
more than 100 [6]. As with the software CWEs, these aim to
provide a basis for hardware designers to be sure that their
designs meet a certain baseline level of security. As such,
we were interested to investigate Copilot’s performance when
considering this shift in domain—speciﬁcally, we are inter-
ested in how Copilot performs when tasked with generating
register-transfer level (RTL) code in the hardware description
language Verilog. We choose Verilog as it is reasonably
popular within the open-source community on GitHub.
Hardware CWEs have some key differences to software
CWEs. Firstly, they concern implementations of hardware
and their interaction with ﬁrmware/software, meaning that
they may consider additional dimensions compared to pure
software CWEs, including timing. As such, they frequently
require additional context (assets) beyond what is provided
with the hardware deﬁnition directly [25].
Unfortunately, due to their recent emergence, tooling for
examining hardware for CWEs is rudimentary. Traditional
security veriﬁcation for RTL is a mix of formal veriﬁcation and
manual evaluation by security experts [26]. Security properties
may be enumerated by considering threat models. One can
then analyze the designs at various stages of the hardware
design cycle to ensure those properties are met. Tools that
one can use include those with linting capabilities [27] [28],
though they do not aim to identify security weaknesses.
Tools like SecVerilog [29] and SecChisel [30], have limited
support for security properties and do not directly deal with
CWEs. Ideally, with the advent of hardware CWEs, tools and
processes may be developed as they have been in software.
Unlike software CWEs, MITRE does not yet produce a
“CWE Top 25” list for hardware. Given this, and the lack of
automated tooling, we chose six hardware CWEs that we could
manually analyze objectively (similar to manually marked
CWEs from the DOW scenarios) in order to evaluate Copilot.
The results are summarized in Table IV. We designed 3
scenarios for each CWE for a total of 18 scenarios. Copilot
was able to generate options to make 198 programs. Of
these, 56 (28.28 %) were vulnerable. Of the 18 scenarios, 7
(38.89 %) had vulnerable top-scoring options.
