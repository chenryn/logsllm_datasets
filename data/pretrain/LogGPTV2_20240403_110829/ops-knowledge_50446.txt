User: Configure the FTP server on the Windows server so that it can accept connection requests from external users and ensure the security of data transmission.
Assistant: If you want to configure FTP server on Windows server and ensure the security of data transmission, you need to perform the following steps: 1. Install IIS (Internet Information Services). IIS is the main component used to configure FTP server in Windows server. IIS can be installed via Control Panel -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows Features on or off. 2. Configure the FTP site. In IIS Manager, right click on Sites and select Add FTP Site. Follow the instructions in the Wizard to complete the site configuration. 3. Create an FTP user account. In IIS Manager, right-click FTP Sites, select FTP Manager, and click FTP Users. Select "From Web Site Local Users and Groups" or "From AD DS Users and Groups". 4. Configure the FTP transfer mode. The FTP server uses the normal mode by default. If you need to ensure the security of data transmission, you can modify it to the implicit SSL/TLS mode. In IIS Manager, right-click on the FTP site, select Properties, then FTP Site -> FTP SSL/TLS Settings, and select the "Implicit SSL/TLS" option. 5. Enable the port of the FTP server. FTP transfers require the use of TCP ports 21 and 20, so open firewall ports to allow FTP transfers. Through the above steps, you can successfully configure the FTP server on the Windows server and ensure the security of data transmission.
