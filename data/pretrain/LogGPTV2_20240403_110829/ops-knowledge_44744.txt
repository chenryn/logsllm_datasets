User: I am trying to install matplotlib into python27 but am running into issues with pip. As stated when I try any 'pip' command I get 

'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command. 

I checked my path variables and they point to the location of my OSGeo4W Python27 install. get-pip.py works and it even says I am up to date on my pip install.
I am wondering if the issue is that I have more than one Python installed on my PC. Arc Desktop decided I needed C:\Python27 and C:\Python34 on top of the OSGeo4W install in the C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27
Anyone know what the issue might be?
Can I consolidate my python installs without breaking anything?
Assistant: You need to add C:\Python27\Scripts to your path as well. That is where the pip executable lives by default. 
Also, remember to close and reopen your command shell after you change your path variable to make sure that the update is loaded.
