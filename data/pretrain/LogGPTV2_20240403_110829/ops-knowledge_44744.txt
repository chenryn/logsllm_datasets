I am attempting to install `matplotlib` into my Python 2.7 environment but am encountering issues with `pip`. When I try to execute any `pip` command, I receive the following error message:

```
'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
```

I have verified that my PATH variables are correctly set to point to the location of my OSGeo4W Python 2.7 installation. Additionally, running `get-pip.py` works and indicates that my `pip` installation is up to date.

I suspect that the issue may be related to having multiple Python installations on my PC. Specifically, ArcGIS Desktop has installed C:\Python27 and C:\Python34, in addition to the OSGeo4W installation located at C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27.

Could someone provide guidance on what might be causing this problem? Is it possible to consolidate my Python installations without disrupting existing configurations?

**Assistant:**

To resolve the issue, you need to ensure that the `Scripts` directory for your Python 2.7 installation is included in your PATH. For the OSGeo4W Python 2.7, this would typically be `C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\Scripts`.

Here are the steps to add the `Scripts` directory to your PATH:

1. **Open the Environment Variables Editor:**
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" on the desktop or in File Explorer.
   - Select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

2. **Edit the PATH Variable:**
   - In the Environment Variables window, find the `Path` variable in the "System variables" section and select it.
   - Click on "Edit."
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on "New" and add the path to the `Scripts` directory, e.g., `C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\Scripts`.
   - Click "OK" to close all the windows.

3. **Reload the Command Shell:**
   - Close and reopen your command prompt to ensure that the updated PATH is loaded.

After completing these steps, you should be able to use `pip` commands without encountering the "not recognized" error.

Regarding consolidating your Python installations, it is generally not recommended unless you are certain that no other software depends on the specific versions of Python installed. If you do decide to consolidate, make sure to back up your current environments and test thoroughly to avoid breaking any dependencies.
