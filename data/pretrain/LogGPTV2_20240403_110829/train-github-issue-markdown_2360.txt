Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var myStr = "Here is a backslash: \\.\n\t\tHere is a new line with two tabs."; // Change this line
Part of the error for this says "myStr should not have any spaces in between
consecutive escape sequences."
What it fails to mention is to not have a space between the escape sequence
and a word which is (Here). This code works fine....... var myStr = "Here is a
backslash: .\n\t\tHere is a new line with two tabs."; // Change this line
