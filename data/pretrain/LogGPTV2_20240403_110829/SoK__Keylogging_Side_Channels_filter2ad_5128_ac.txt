in Table I. Corroborating this relationship, an examination
of the data reveals that as typing speed increases, keystroke
durations become more uniform and consistent
leading to
reduced information gain. Conversely, the dependence of inter-
keystroke timings on key distance and location becomes more
evident with increased typing speed, as previously noted by
Salthouse and others [43], [47].
IV. ATTACKS
A keylogging side channel attack can target either the
user, the keyboard itself, the host computer, or the network.
Table II provides a summary of speciﬁc keylogging side
channel attacks for each of these targets where each attack
is characterized by the following attributes.
Modality is the medium through which the side channel is
sensed, such as a physical medium (e.g., sound), a hardware
component (e.g., shared memory), or an application protocol.

with Gaussian PDF estimates for each of 22 unique keys
in a sample of English text from a single user in a large
keystroke dataset [45] (see Appendix A for dataset details
and Appendix B for a summary of public keystroke datasets).
The information gain is determined with P [d|k] given by the
Gaussian PDF estimate for each key and P [k] = 1
22 to reﬂect
a uniform prior (maximum intrinsic entropy with 22 observed
keys). Thus, H0 = 4.46 bits since there are 22 unique keys.
In Figure 7 (left), more information is gained for relatively
high or low durations since these are rare; information gain
is lowest where the durations tend to cluster around 120 ms.
The total information gain is 0.36 bits per key.
In many side channels, the time interval between successive
keystrokes is of interest. This is especially true for those
attacks described in Section IV-D that exploit network trafﬁc
timings in which only key press timestamps are available. For
these attacks, duration cannot be computed because release
times are not available.
2) Latency: The latency between successive keystrokes
can be utilized to identify key pairs. There are exactly four
different latency features formed by each combination of key
press and release from two successive keystrokes, given by
Press-Press (PP):
Press-Release (PR):
Release-Press (RP):
Release-Release (RR):

Unlike duration, the latencies correspond to pairs of keys, or
bigrams. Despite the intrinsic entropy being much larger (there
are 26 × 26 = 676 possible bigrams from letter keys alone),
information gained from latency can be substantial due to a
greater separation between bigram latency distributions.
Figure 6 (right) shows the Gaussian PDF estimates for
RP latency from the same user in the previous section. Like
duration, PP and PR latencies are nonnegative. However, RP
