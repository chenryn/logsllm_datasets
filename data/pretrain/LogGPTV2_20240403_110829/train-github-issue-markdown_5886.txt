 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8
**Code**
I have following tsconfig.json file in my project root directory (e.g.
P:\MyProjectRoot\tsconfig.json):
    {
        "compileOnSave": true,
        "compilerOptions": {
            "preserveConstEnums": true,
            "experimentalDecorators": true,
            "declaration": false,
            "emitBOM": true,
            "sourceMap": true,
            "outFile": "Scripts/site/Serene.Web.js"
        }
    }
I have my .ts files under some sub folders of ~/Scripts and ~/Modules
directories.
I'm running TypeScript compiler with the following command line:
      P:\MyProjectRoot>"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript\1.8\tsc"
**Expected behavior:**
I expect it to generate a output at
P:\MyProjectRoot\scripts\site\Serene.Web.js
**Actual behavior:**
tsc just exists without generating a file or giving any error.
If i run same command line under P:\MyProjectRoot\scripts:
      P:\MyProjectRoot\scripts>"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript\1.8\tsc"
It generates the expected output.
As a side note, tsc is not in path, not sure if it has any effects.
Also this root folder has a .csproj file with TypeScript configured. I tried
to delete all files except tsconfig.json in root directory, but it had no
effect.
There is no other tsconfig.json file in subdirectories or parent folders.
