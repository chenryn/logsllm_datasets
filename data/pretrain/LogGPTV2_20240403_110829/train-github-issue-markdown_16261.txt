### Elasticsearch Version:
2.3

### JVM Version:
1.8.0

### OS Version:
Windows 7

### Description of the Problem (Expected vs. Actual Behavior):
I have configured CORS settings in the `elasticsearch.yml` file as follows:

```yaml
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-origin: "*"
http.cors.allow-methods: OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
http.cors.allow-headers: X-Requested-With, X-Auth-Token, Content-Type, Content-Length
```

When I attempt to request Elasticsearch from a local file (`file:///C:/elastic/index.html`), I encounter the following error:

```
Request header field Content-Type is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers
```

However, when I switch to Elasticsearch version 2.2 and use the same configuration, it works without any issues.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the CORS parameters in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.
2. Request Elasticsearch from a URL like `file:///C:/...`.
