Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Log Entry:
- Date: 17/06/09
- Time: 20:10:40
- Severity: INFO
- Component: spark.SecurityManager
- Message: 
  - Authentication: Disabled
  - UI ACLs: Disabled
  - Users with View Permissions: {yarn, curi}
  - Users with Modify Permissions: {yarn, curi}
- Timestamp: 1497010240
```

This format clearly separates each piece of information, making it easier to read and understand.
