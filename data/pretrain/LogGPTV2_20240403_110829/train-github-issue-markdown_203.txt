We are experiencing an issue (since we upgraded from celery 2.5 to 3.0) where
our workers mysteriously stop consuming messages from the Q's they are
configured on.
It happens periodically on each worker node independently, and i cannot get to
the root of what is causing it.
`celery inspect -d appserver-i-82df38f8.prod active` always returns empty.  
I did find something slightly interesting, in that, the list of reserved tasks
seems to stay static for a long time. Since these tasks do not have an eta
set, why don't they execute? I cant think of any reason why they are not being
executed?
Does the reserved Q have any relationship to the prefetch Q? i.e. if there are
a lot of reserved tasks which do not execute would that prevent the node from
retrieving more tasks from the server?
When looking at the rabbit MQ management interface I can see this node is
listed as a consumer.
I have collected some info from the node which may shine some light on this,
but am at a loss as to why this could happen. Could you provide some pointers
for things to look into?
