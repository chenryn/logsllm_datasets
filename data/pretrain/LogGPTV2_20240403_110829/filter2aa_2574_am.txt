Here are some examples search terms that you can use on Google to find sensitive 
information online:
• 
“Index of /backup”: This will return a list of unprotected servers that 
contain backup data. Such files can contain sensitive information.
• 
“robots.txt” “Disallow:” filetype:txt: The robots.txt file usually 
resides within the root directory of a web server and instructs search 
engine crawlers on the parts of your website that you do not them 
to look at (in other words, that you want ignored from the indexing 
process). Hackers check robots.txt files to see the unindexed files to 
gain intelligence or to access sensitive locations.
• 
budget site:gov filetype:xls: This query will return all publicly 
accessible Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the term budget from all 
websites that have the .gov domain name.

 Search Engines Powered by Google
While Google is great at web searches, it does not have a clean record in terms of 
respecting a user’s privacy. Google and other giant IT providers monitor their users’ 
online activities to some extent to understand their browsing habits and thus target them 
with customized advertisements. Another disadvantage for using a Google search is the 
fact that Google records your previous searches and may omit some results from future 
searches if it finds them irrelevant to your browsing habits. This is dangerous for online 
investigations because it may limit the result set returned by Google, according to the 
searcher’s previous browsing history.
The Google search algorithm is considered the best one for returning relevant 
results. However, for privacy-conscious people, there are many search engines that 
retrieve their search results from Google without invading users’ privacy by collecting 
information about their searches. These are the most popular ones:
• 
StartPage (https://www.startpage.com)
• 
Lukol (https://www.lukol.com)
• 
Mozbot (https://www.mozbot.com )
 Bing
Bing is the second most popular search engine after Google; it was developed by 
Microsoft and is the default search engine in the Internet Explorer and Edge browsers. 
Bing has many similarities to Google basic search operators. Table 4-2 lists the main 
search operators that can be used to refine your search on Bing (don’t use a space after 
the colon in the examples).

You can compare the results retrieved by Google and Bing for the same search query 
by going to http://bvsg.org/index.html.
Another useful service that allows you to construct complex search queries for both 
Google and Bing visually is Advangle (http://advangle.com), as shown in Figure 4-6. 
You can also save your queries in an Advangle account (registration is free) to return to 
them later.

 Other Search Engines
Many OSINT investigators prefer to use more than one search engine to fetch results. 
Indeed, you will be surprised at the diversity of results when using different search 
engines to search for the same query. Table 4-3 lists other popular search engines that 
can be used to locate information online, by popularity. Bear in mind that you should 
anonymize your connection before conducting any search, or you can simply use the Tor 
Browser to conduct your search.

 Business Search Sites
Although the term OSINT comes from the military, its value has not been limited to this 
context only. Nowadays, businesses rely heavily on OSINT to empower their decision- 
making processes in addition to predicting future events.

Finding information about corporations is essential for any online investigation. 
For example, business information gathered from OSINT sources can reveal important 
information such as business profits, current and future projects, business hierarchy, 
and company dates (such as annual meetings, corporate holidays, or investor meetings). 
Such information is helpful in many cases (for example, to find out whether a specific 
company or a person was part of a tax evasion case).
In this section, we will list sites that can be used to retrieve important information 
about businesses globally.
 Find Business Annual Records
An annual report is a document issued by a company to its stockholders once a year. It 
contains valuable information about a corporation’s financial status such as its budget, 
financial position, profits, loss, management and auditor reports, and cash flow. You 
can also find a general description about the industry in which the intended company 
belongs.
The following sites give free access to thousands of annual reports published by 
different industries:
• 
www.annualreports.com lists thousands of annual records from 5,333 
companies worldwide.
• 
https://www.reportlinker.com contains more than 60 million 
searchable tables, figures, and datasets.
• 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas- 
registries/overseas-registries lists all the company registries 
located around the world offered by the U.K. government.
• 
https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html is 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (see Figure 4-7).

www.sedar.com gives access to public securities documents and 
information filed by all Canadian securities administrators.
• 
https://www.commercial-register.sg.ch/home/worldwide.html 
gives a list of government and commercial registers around the globe.
Annual reports can also be found on a corporation’s website; simply go to the About 
Us page or conduct a search for annual report using the corporate site search facility to 
find such files. They usually come in PDF or HTML format.
