Here are some examples of search terms that you can use on Google to find sensitive information online:

- **"Index of /backup"**: This query will return a list of unprotected servers containing backup data. Such files may include sensitive information.
- **"robots.txt" "Disallow:" filetype:txt**: The `robots.txt` file, typically located in the root directory of a web server, instructs search engine crawlers on which parts of a website should not be indexed. Hackers often check `robots.txt` files to identify unindexed files or access sensitive locations.
- **budget site:gov filetype:xls**: This query will return all publicly accessible Microsoft Excel spreadsheets containing the term "budget" from websites with the `.gov` domain.

**Search Engines Powered by Google**

While Google is excellent for web searches, it has a mixed record regarding user privacy. Google and other major IT providers monitor user activities to some extent to understand browsing habits and target users with customized advertisements. Additionally, Google records previous searches and may exclude results deemed irrelevant based on a user's browsing history. This can be problematic for online investigations as it may limit the result set returned by Google.

The Google search algorithm is highly effective at returning relevant results. However, for privacy-conscious users, there are several search engines that retrieve results from Google without collecting information about user searches. Some popular options include:
- **StartPage (https://www.startpage.com)**
- **Lukol (https://www.lukol.com)**
- **Mozbot (https://www.mozbot.com)**

**Bing**

Bing, developed by Microsoft, is the second most popular search engine after Google and is the default search engine in Internet Explorer and Edge browsers. Bing shares many similarities with Google's basic search operators. Table 4-2 lists the main search operators that can be used to refine your Bing searches (do not use a space after the colon in the examples).

You can compare the results retrieved by Google and Bing for the same search query by visiting http://bvsg.org/index.html. Another useful service is Advangle (http://advangle.com), which allows you to construct complex search queries visually for both Google and Bing. You can also save your queries in an Advangle account (registration is free) for future reference.

**Table 4-2. Bing Search Operators**

| Operator | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `""` | `"French food"` | Searches for an exact phrase |

**Other Search Engines**

Many OSINT investigators prefer to use multiple search engines to gather diverse results. Table 4-3 lists other popular search engines that can be used to locate information online, ranked by popularity. It is advisable to anonymize your connection before conducting any search, or you can use the Tor Browser.

**Business Search Sites**

Although the term OSINT originates from the military, its value extends beyond this context. Businesses now rely heavily on OSINT for decision-making and predicting future events.

**Finding Information About Corporations**

Gathering business information from OSINT sources can reveal important details such as business profits, current and future projects, business hierarchy, and key dates (e.g., annual meetings, corporate holidays, investor meetings). This information is valuable in various scenarios, such as investigating tax evasion cases.

In this section, we will list sites that can be used to retrieve important information about businesses globally.

**Find Business Annual Records**

An annual report is a document issued by a company to its stockholders once a year, containing valuable financial information such as budget, financial position, profits, loss, management and auditor reports, and cash flow. The following sites provide free access to thousands of annual reports:

- **www.annualreports.com**: Lists thousands of annual records from 5,333 companies worldwide.
- **https://www.reportlinker.com**: Contains more than 60 million searchable tables, figures, and datasets.
- **https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-registries/overseas-registries**: Lists all the company registries around the world offered by the U.K. government.

Annual reports can also be found on a corporation's website. Simply navigate to the "About Us" page or use the site's search facility to find these files, which are usually available in PDF or HTML format.
