After upgrading to the alpha version 34 of the router, I encountered runtime errors related to the `routeConfig` object. Specifically, the error message is:

```
TypeError: router_2.RouteConfig is not a function
```

This issue does not occur when using version alpha.33. The type definitions (typings) appear to be correct, indicating that this is a runtime error specific to version 34.

For clarity:
- **Router Version:** Alpha 34
- **Error Message:** `TypeError: router_2.RouteConfig is not a function`
- **Previous Version (No Error):** Alpha 33

Please let me know if you need more information or if there are any steps I can take to help diagnose and resolve this issue.
