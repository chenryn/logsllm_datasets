 **Symfony version(s) affected** : master
**Description**  
Routes are not recognized when using one dynamic on one hand, and one with a
specified host on the other hand.
**How to reproduce**  
Here is a simple PHPUnit test :
        public function testDynamic()
        {
            $routes = new RouteCollection();
            $routes->add('a_host', new Route('/', [], [], [], 'api.example.com'));
            $routes->add('a_dot', new Route('/a/{letter}.dot', [], [], [], 'localhost'));
            $routes->add('a_dot_any_host', new Route('/b/{letter}.dot'));
            $dumper = new PhpMatcherDumper($routes);
            eval(substr($dumper->dump(), 5));
            $context = new RequestContext();
            $urlMatcher = new \ProjectUrlMatcher($context);
            $this->assertInternalType('array', $urlMatcher->match('/a/a.dot'));
            $this->assertInternalType('array', $urlMatcher->match('/b/a.dot'));
        }
The second test will raise a
`Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\ResourceNotFoundException`.
**Possible Solution**
I think the host pattern is too greedy in the dynamic host routes compilation
and should not match `/` as well as `.`, as it was in previous commit.

**Additional context**
The problem occurs if you specify a route with a specified host and the
profiler : the `exception.css` route of the profiler doesn't match...
