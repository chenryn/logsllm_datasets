### Symfony Version(s) Affected
- **Version**: master

### Description
When using a combination of dynamic routes and routes with specified hosts, the routing system fails to recognize certain routes correctly.

### How to Reproduce
Below is a simple PHPUnit test that demonstrates the issue:

```php
public function testDynamic()
{
    $routes = new RouteCollection();
    // Route with a specified host
    $routes->add('a_host', new Route('/', [], [], [], 'api.example.com'));
    // Dynamic route with a specified host
    $routes->add('a_dot', new Route('/a/{letter}.dot', [], [], [], 'localhost'));
    // Dynamic route without a specified host
    $routes->add('a_dot_any_host', new Route('/b/{letter}.dot'));

    $dumper = new PhpMatcherDumper($routes);
    eval(substr($dumper->dump(), 5));

    $context = new RequestContext();
    $urlMatcher = new \ProjectUrlMatcher($context);

    // This should match
    $this->assertInternalType('array', $urlMatcher->match('/a/a.dot'));

    // This will raise a `Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\ResourceNotFoundException`
    $this->assertInternalType('array', $urlMatcher->match('/b/a.dot'));
}
```

### Possible Solution
The issue appears to be related to the host pattern being too greedy during the compilation of dynamic host routes. Specifically, the host pattern should not match `/` or `.` characters as it did in previous commits. 

For reference, see the changes in the following pull request:

### Additional Context
This problem is particularly noticeable when specifying a route with a specific host and using the profiler. For example, the `exception.css` route of the profiler does not match correctly under these conditions.
