User: I want to pipe [edit: real-time text] the output of several subprocesses (sometimes chained, sometimes parallel) to a single terminal/tty window that is not the active python shell (be it an IDE, command-line, or a running script using tkinter). IPython is not an option. I need something that comes with the standard install.  Prefer OS-agnostic solution, but needs to work on XP/Vista. 
I'll post what I've tried already if you want it, but itâ€™s embarrassing.
Assistant: You say "pipe" so I assume you're dealing with text output from the subprocesses.  A simple solution may be to just write output to files?
e.g. in the subprocess:

Redirect output %TEMP%\output.txt
On exit, copy output.txt to a directory your main process is watching.

In the main process:

Every second, examine directory for new files.
When files found, process and remove them.

You could encode the subprocess name in the output filename so you know how to process it.
