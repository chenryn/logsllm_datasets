A ADDITIONAL RESULTS
This appendix presents the complete list of graphs for the results
discussed in previous sections, including those illustrating the re-
lationship between CDN demand and mobility for 20 of the top
US counties based on population density and Internet penetration
(§A.1), between demand and growth rate of infection for the 25
counties with the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases by
April 2020 (§A.2), and between demand and incidence of COVID-19
cases before and after campus closing in college towns around the
US (§A.3).
A.1 Demand and Mobility
Figures 6 and 7 show the correlation between human mobility
(Google CMR) and CDN demand during April and May 2020. See
Sec. 4 for a discussion of the results.
A.2 Demand and infection GR
Figure 8 shows the correlation between CDN demand and Infec-
tion GR in 25 US counties. The reader is referred to Sec. 5 for the
discussion of key findings.
A.3 Demand and infection ratio in college
towns
Figure 9 shows the correlation between CDN demand and COVID-
19 incidence. Table 5 lists the different campuses and student en-
rollments, their college town (county) and their population, as well
as the population ratio [29]. The reader is referred to Sec. 6 for the
discussion of key findings.
