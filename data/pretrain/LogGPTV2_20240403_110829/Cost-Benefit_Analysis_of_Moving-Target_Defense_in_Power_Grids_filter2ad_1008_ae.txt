MTD) will differ signiﬁcantly. Consequently the generator
dispatch in the two systems will be different leading to an
increase in the OPF cost.
We also plot the quantities γ(Ht, Ht(cid:48)) and γ(Ht(cid:48), H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) for
every hour in Fig. 11. We observe that γ(Ht, Ht(cid:48)) is nearly
zero for all the simulation instants. This is because the matrices

perturbation and post-perturbation measurement matrices.
Ht and Ht(cid:48) do not differ signiﬁcantly due to the temporal
correlation of the system load between different simulation in-
stants and their column spaces are nearly aligned. These results
also validate the approximation γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
D. Discussion
t(cid:48)) ≈ γ(Ht(cid:48), H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)).
To put the MTD operational cost in perspective, we can
compare it against the potential cost of damage due to a
BDD-bypassing attack. For example, prior work [5], [20]
suggests that such an attack can increase the OPF cost by
up to 28%, and additionally cause transmission line trips
(considering IEEE 14-bus system with similar simulation
settings). Our numbers suggest that the MTD’s operational cost
is comparatively signiﬁcantly smaller. In practice, based on
its own deployment scenario and other factors like estimated
likelihood of attacks, the SO can make similar comparisons to
assess the merits of adopting the MTD defense.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
We addressed the problem of selecting MTD reactance
perturbations that are truly effective in thwarting stealthy FDI
attacks against SE in power grids. We devised a novel metric
to quantify the MTD’s effectiveness, and identiﬁed key design
criteria to compute effective MTD perturbations in practice.
We also showed that the effective MTD may incur a non-
trivial operational cost, and provided analysis to expose the
cost-beneﬁt tradeoff of the MTD in an OPF framework. Our
result offers MTD to system operators as an insurance against

APPENDIX A: PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
To simplify notation, in this appendix, we drop the time
subscripts t and t(cid:48) from the relevant quantities.
A sketch of the proof is as follows. First, we express the
residual r(cid:48) as the sum of two components, a noise component
a||.
n and an attack component r(cid:48)
r(cid:48)
We then show that for attacks that satisfy the condition of
Proposition 1, r(cid:48)
a = 0, and hence their detection probability
is no greater than the FP rate.
a, given by r(cid:48) = ||r(cid:48)

We proceed with the ﬁrst step of the proof. Recall the

(cid:48)||, where z(cid:48) = H(cid:48)θ
(cid:48)
expression of r(cid:48) = ||z(cid:48) − H(cid:48)(cid:98)θ
(cid:98)θ
(cid:48)
= (H(cid:48)T WH(cid:48))−1H(cid:48)T Wz(cid:48). It can be simpliﬁed as
r(cid:48) = ||z(cid:48) − H(cid:48)(H(cid:48)T WH(cid:48))−1H(cid:48)T Wz(cid:48)||
= ||H(cid:48)θ

+ n + Hc)||
(5)
where Γ(cid:48) = H(cid:48)(H(cid:48)T WH(cid:48))−1H(cid:48)T W. We note that r(cid:48) consists

of two components, a noise component r(cid:48)
an attack component r(cid:48)
a = 0, then the
detection probability of a is no greater than the FP rate α, and
hence, the attack is undetectable under the MTD perturbation
H(cid:48). Note that for all the attacks a = Hc ∈ Col(H(cid:48)), r(cid:48)
a = 0.
In other words, the system of equations Hc = H(cid:48)c(cid:48) must be
consistent, for some c(cid:48) ∈ RN . This condition holds true if and
only if rank(H(cid:48)) = rank([H(cid:48) Hc]) [32].

APPENDIX B: PROOF OF THEOREM 1
A sketch of the proof is as follows. We prove the ﬁrst
statement by showing that for an MTD H(cid:48) satisfying the
orthogonality condition, r(cid:48)
a = 0 if an only if c = 0. Thus it
follows that there are no non-zero attacks that are undetectable
under such an MTD. To prove the second statement, we show
a||. Furthermore, we
that P (cid:48)
show that ||r(cid:48)
a|| achieves its maximum value under the MTD
perturbation that satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 1.
We begin with the proof of the ﬁrst statement of Theorem 1.
If Col(H(cid:48)) is the orthogonal complement of Col(H), then
D(a) increases as we increase ||r(cid:48)
H(cid:48)T WHc = 0, ∀c ∈ RN , since Hc ∈ Col(H). In this case,
r(cid:48)
a becomes
a = Hc − H(cid:48)(H(cid:48)T WH(cid:48))−1H(cid:48)T WHc = Hc.
r(cid:48)
Recall that an attack is undetectable if r(cid:48)
a = 0. For MTD
H(cid:48) that satisﬁes the orthogonality condition, substituting for
r(cid:48)
a from (6), we have that Hc = 0. Since H is a full rank
matrix, the set of equations Hc = 0 has a unique solution
c = 0 [32]. Hence, there are no non-zero undetectable attacks
of the form a = Hc.
note that under any MTD H(cid:48), ||r(cid:48)

manner. The upper bound follows from
Next, we prove the second statement of Theorem 1. First,
a|| can be bounded as 0 ≤
a|| ≤ ||a||. The lower bound is true in a straightforward
||r(cid:48)
n +r(cid:48)
n + r(cid:48)
a|| = ||(I − Γ(cid:48))a|| ≤ ||(I − Γ(cid:48))|| ||a|| = ||a||,
a is a Gaussian random variable with r(cid:48)
(6)
where the last equality is due to the fact that I − Γ(cid:48) is a
projection matrix and hence has unit norm. Furthermore, under
any MTD H(cid:48), r(cid:48) = ||r(cid:48)
a|| follows a noncentral chi-square
distribution [33] with its noncentrality parameter equal to ||r(cid:48)
a||
(since r(cid:48)
a as its
mean).
For a non-central chi-square distributed random variable X,
P(X ≥ τ ) increases by increasing the noncentrality parameter.
D(a) = P(r(cid:48) ≥
Hence, we can conclude that the quantity P (cid:48)

τ ) increases by increasing ||r(cid:48)
quantity ||r(cid:48)
a|| depends on the choice of MTD H(cid:48). Thus, we
can conclude that MTD perturbations that yield a greater value
a|| can detect the attack vector a with higher probability
of ||r(cid:48)
(i.e., P (cid:48)
D(a) is higher).
In particular, for MTD H(cid:48) that satisﬁes the conditions of
a|| = ||a||, which is
Theorem 1, from (6), we note that ||r(cid:48)
also the maximum value of ||r(cid:48)
achieves the maximum possible value of P (cid:48)
a||. Therefore, such an MTD

APPENDIX C: CONJECTURE OF SECTION 5.3
In this appendix, we present arguments that

perturbations with higher γ(H, H(cid:48)). We use the short-hand

notation f (u, v) to represent the quantity

||u||=1,||v||=1
of ||r(cid:48)
The conjecture can be argued by examining the dependence
a|| on γ(H, H(cid:48)) in the following three cases:
• Case 1: When Col(H(cid:48)) is the orthogonal complement
of Col(H), we have that f (u, v) = 0 (since uH v =
0, ∀u ∈ Col(H), v ∈ Col(H(cid:48))), and γ(H, H(cid:48)) =
cos−1(0) = π/2. From the arguments in Appendix B,
recall that in this case, ||r(cid:48)
• Case 2: When Col(H) and Col(H(cid:48)) are identical (e.g.
when H(cid:48) = (1 + η)H), we have that f (u, v) = 1, and
γ(H, H(cid:48)) = cos−1(1) = 0. In this case, after straightfor-
ward simpliﬁcation, it can be shown that ||r(cid:48)
• Case 3: For 0 ≤ γ ≤ π/2, from reference [16], we have
a|| = ||a||.
a|| = 0.
the following bound
||r(cid:48)
a|| ≤ sin(γ(H, H(cid:48)))||a||.
(7)
Note that the bound of (7) increases as γ(H, H(cid:48)) in-
creases, which suggests that ||r(cid:48)
a|| also increases.
The conjecture can be justiﬁed from the observation in these

D(a) increases as ||r(cid:48)
three cases and using the fact that P (cid:48)
increases (Appendix B).
