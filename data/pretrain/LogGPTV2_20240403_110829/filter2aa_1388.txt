### Background

Anonymity is a significant concern in today's digital world. There are various methods to hide one's identity, such as:

1. **TOR (The Onion Router)**
2. **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**
3. **Spotflux**
4. **Hola**

**Proxyham?** (Note: This appears to be a placeholder or an unfinished thought. Consider clarifying or removing it.)

### Introduction

Wi-Fi is ubiquitous, but is it secure enough? While it has its own network isolation and WPA2 with AES encryption, it is often open to the public for "competitive" convenience. This raises security concerns.

### Problem Space

Public Wi-Fi poses significant risks, particularly in terms of "Wi-Fi Exfiltration" and host implications.

### Security Challenges

- **Insufficient Authentication:** A catch-22 situation.
- **Lack of Egress Monitoring:**
- **Default SSL:**
- **Spoofed MAC Addresses:**

### Our Concept

We developed a custom mobile app, batch scripts, and two servers with dedicated IPs to address these challenges. The system:

- Scans for open Wi-Fi networks.
- Tags the location.
- Connects automatically.
- Learns about the network.
- Collects public fingerprints.
- Syncs with a central server.

### Programs and Tools Used

- **Programming Languages:**
  - Python
  - Java
  - Bash
- **Databases:**
  - SQLite
- **Data Formats:**
  - JSON
- **Web Server:**
  - Apache
- **Version Control:**
  - GitHub
- **Development Approach:**
  - Crash course mentality
- **Mobile Development:**
  - Android SDK Toolkit

### Hardware and Tools

- **Operating System:**
  - Kali Linux (on a laptop)
- **Mobile Device:**
  - Android Phone
- **Servers:**
  - CentOS Servers

### Automated Toolkit: Wargarble

#### Warscanble – Initial Area Scan/Discovery

- **Definition:** A simple Wi-Fi scanner to coordinate the gathering of access points.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Scan for all access points.**
  2. **Store results in a hashable object that includes:**
     - Static values
     - Location values paired with signal strength
  3. **Enhance location data by comparing new data to existing data and selecting a candidate.**

#### Updating Entries

- **Location and Strength Approach:**
  - Select a candidate based on the best match.

#### Roadmap

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Better triangulation algorithms
  - Real-time Wi-Fi map across all devices
  - Easier integration points for other tools

#### Wargarble – Part II (Connectivity + Data Collection)

- **Functions:**
  - Strips and parses the info collected by Warscanble, focusing on open networks.
  - Connects and determines the public gateway.
  - Makes outbound handshake connections to a remote server to determine open ports based on a specified range.
  - Stores results in a database for final reporting and plotting.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - Bash
  - Sed
  - Awk
  - SQLite
  - Python sockets

#### Warrepo – Part III (Multiport Traffic ACK Server and Central Collection)

- **Purpose:**
  - Multiport traffic ACK server
  - Central collection of information

- **Functions:**
  - Opens all ports to allow connections using any TCP port and responds, providing a way to find allowed egress ports.
  - Collects and plots results from Warscanble’s data centrally.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - SQLite
  - PHP
  - IPtables
  - Bash

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Audit and Review:** Regularly audit and review your traffic and firewall policies.
- **Tune Appliances/Applications:** Fine-tune your security appliances and applications.
- **Plan and Segment Infrastructure:** Plan, deploy, and segment your infrastructure.
- **Collaborate:** Listen to your team and foster cross-departmental relationships.

This presentation aims to highlight the risks associated with public Wi-Fi and provide practical solutions to mitigate these risks.
