### Key Generation and Security Implications

The presence of small prime divisors in RSA keys can significantly impact their security. The rejection of 2047-bit RSA keys increased the average key generation time to 141 seconds. Generating both ID card key pairs alone would extend the renewal process by approximately five minutes on average, and in worst-case scenarios, even more time, as shown in Figure 15b.

For jTOP SLE78-powered ID cards, the practice of using a random public exponent was discontinued. The average key generation time of 13 seconds (see Figure 16 for distribution) was deemed acceptable for both initial key generation and ID card renewal at PPA customer service points. Later, switching to ECC with curve P-384 reduced the on-card key generation time to an average of 0.37 seconds.

### Key Management and Security Risks

The fact that the same key was imported into two different ID cards renewed at different PPA customer service points suggests that the keys were generated in the manufacturer's backend and then imported into the ID card over the Internet. Even if the keys were sent over an end-to-end encrypted channel, the logs and symmetric card management keys could be used by the manufacturer to recover the imported private keys.

The unauthorized modification of the EstEID applet by the manufacturer has significant implications for the validity of digital signatures made with the affected platform. Since this modified version of the EstEID applet never passed the secure-signature-creation device (SSCD) conformity assessment as required by the eSignature Directive 1999/93/EC [36], this ID card platform never had SSCD status, which is a legal prerequisite for a digital signature to have handwritten signature status.

### Incident Response

After receiving our analysis, the authorities decided to recall the jTOP SLE66-powered ID cards renewed at PPA customer service points. Out of more than 74,000 renewed ID cards, only 12,500 were still valid.

On May 17, 2018, PPA announced that 12,500 ID cards did not meet security requirements because their private keys had been generated outside the chip. These cards would be replaced under warranty, and on June 1, 2018, the affected certificates would be revoked [37].

Affected cardholders received email notifications to apply for replacement, specifying the PPA customer service point where they would collect the new card. The replacement cards, jTOP SLE78-powered ID cards, had the same expiration date as the original. However, replacement cards were not issued if the original expiration date was within three months [37, 38].

On June 1, 2018, the certificates of 11,100 non-replaced ID cards were revoked, with 3,300 cardholders waiting to receive the replacement card [39]. The legal basis for certificate revocation was the EITSETA act [40], clause 19 (4) 2): "a possibility of using the private key corresponding to a public key contained in the certificate without the consent of the certificate holder" [41].

Even if the authorities had not considered this a security issue, there was a non-compliance issue, and the certificates could have been revoked based on the EITSETA act clause 19 (4) 12): "appearance of an error in the certificate or in the data entered in the certificate," as the certificates had not been issued in accordance with the CA's certificate policy referenced in the certificate.

### Claim Against the Manufacturer

According to PPA, an internal audit found that the state had not asked and was not aware that Gemalto was generating keys outside the card [41]. After receiving our initial analysis, PPA submitted a claim to Gemalto. A response from Gemalto denying violation was only received the night before the announcement for the ID card recall [42].

On May 18, 2018, Gemalto announced that PPA’s statements were a surprise and that it had fulfilled the ID card contract and the obligations agreed therein [42]. The state was put in an unfortunate situation, as it was evident that the ID card manufacturer could not be trusted, but contractually, they had to produce ID cards until the end of 2018, when the new manufacturer IDEMIA would take over.

On September 26, 2018, after failing to reach an agreement, PPA brought Gemalto to court, demanding a contractual penalty of 152 million EUR for generating keys outside the chip [2]. This claim must be viewed in the context of other ongoing litigations with Gemalto, including PPA’s claim of 300,000 EUR from Gemalto for their failure to inform the state about the ROCA flaw [43] and Gemalto’s appeal about the results of ID card procurement [44]. The court decisions on these cases are yet to be seen.

### Certificates with Corrupted RSA Public Keys

In 2012, Heninger et al. [45] published an efficient method for testing RSA public keys for shared prime factors. This method was used to find that 103 RSA keys from Taiwan’s Citizen Digital Certificates share prime factors [46]. We used the same method to test the RSA public keys from Estonian ID card certificates for shared prime factors and found several small common factors (e.g., 3, 5, 7) in the output of pairwise GCD computation. By using trial division with small primes, we found 14 certificates whose public key moduli could be divided by one or several small factors. Since the public key modulus of 2048-bit RSA is generated by multiplying two distinct random 1024-bit primes, the public key moduli included in the certificates were evidently corrupted. This corruption seemed to affect only the jTOP SLE78 platform, as all the certificates with the corrupted moduli had been issued for ID cards powered by the jTOP SLE78 platform.

We used the software utility YAFU [47] with the GMP-ECM implementation of the elliptic curve method (ECM) to test all RSA keys in our dataset for small factors. The keys were tested up to t-level t20. This, however, did not find any additional corrupted keys. Two of the corrupted keys had an obvious anomaly—the length of the modulus was 2040 bits. We found one more anomalous 2040-bit modulus in our dataset and, by applying more ECM testing (about t40), we were able to find a 132-bit prime factor. Later, when Nemec et al. [18] published a method to detect moduli generated by the vulnerable Infineon’s key generation algorithm, we identified 8 more presumably corrupted moduli. These were discovered when we observed that these certificates, according to the certificate revocation date, had been revoked due to the ROCA flaw and hence had been issued for jTOP SLE78-powered ID cards, did not have the structure of ROCA keys. The full set of 23 identified certificates is listed in Table 2.

### Full Factorization

The issuance of ID card certificates with corrupted public key moduli means that the cardholders of these ID cards will not be able to use the cryptographic functionality, as the private key residing in their ID card does not correspond to the public key in the certificate. The corruption of the public key also has critical security consequences. By recovering all the prime factors from the corrupted modulus, it is possible to calculate the corresponding private exponent and perform private key operations with the key. For a 2048-bit modulus, we can expect to factorize the corrupted modulus efficiently with a probability of 12–22% for an arbitrary corruption [48].
