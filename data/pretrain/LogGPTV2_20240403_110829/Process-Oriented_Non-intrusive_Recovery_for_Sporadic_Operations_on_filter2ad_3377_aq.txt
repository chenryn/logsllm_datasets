### Satisfying Recovery Requirement R7

The maximum recovery time for "recovery for recovery" is 3.19 seconds. Consequently, the combined time for the original recovery and the "recovery for recovery" is significantly less than the specified time gap between two adjacent recovery points. This ensures that the requirement for "recovery for recovery" is met by POD-Recovery.

### Case Study 2: Recovery for Installation Operation on Cloud

#### Overview

In this section, we present the evaluation results of POD-Recovery using the installation operation on a cloud as a case study. The experiment aims to achieve three objectives:
1. Demonstrate the determination of recovery points for installation.
2. Present the workload of resource state management for installation.
3. Showcase POD-Recovery's capability in meeting recovery requirements through installation.

The experimental environment is detailed in Figure 26.

#### 8.2.1 Recovery Points Determination

The installation operation consists of four steps:
1. Launch a web instance.
2. Assign an elastic IP to the web instance.
3. Launch a database instance.
4. Assign an elastic IP to the database instance.

Figure 30 illustrates the sections resulting from different levels of granularity in determining recovery points:
- **Figure 30(a):** Obtained by applying the "Recovery Actions Identifiable" method to the installation steps.
- **Figure 30(b):** Combines sections with low failure rates.

Based on the recovery points determination procedure, the recovery points were set after step 2 and step 4.

#### 8.2.2 Workload of Resource Space Determination

The determined resource space includes two types of resources:
- **Instance (i.e., VM):** Attributes include instance ID, instance type, machine image, etc.
- **Elastic IP address:** Can be attached to an instance or not attached to any instance.

The workload for determining the resource space for the installation operation is shown in Figure 31, based on 30 runs. The average execution time is 37.37 ms, with a relative standard deviation of 15.73%. The 75th percentile value is 39.75 ms.

#### 8.2.3 Workload of Expected Resource State Templates Generation

The workload for generating expected resource state templates for the installation operation is shown in Figure 32, based on 30 runs. The average execution time is 41.37 ms, with a relative standard deviation of 7.98%. The 75th percentile value is 43 ms.

#### 8.2.4 Recovery Satisfying Requirements

POD-Recovery is designed to meet all eight recovery requirements outlined in Section 3.5. Experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate how POD-Recovery fulfills each requirement using the installation operation.

##### A. Runtime Recovery (Satisfying Recovery Requirement R1)

As described in Chapters 4-7, our method is inherently a runtime recovery solution.

##### B. Recovery Satisfying RTO

###### 1) Experimental Procedure

This requirement concerns the time taken for the system to reach a consistent state during recovery. We measure the recovery time by performing the installation operation on a cloud application. No software is running in the cloud instances during the installation. We use a proprietary fault injection tool to inject faults at the two determined recovery points, automatically determine applicable recovery patterns, and perform recovery using the selected acceptable recovery actions. The selected recovery actions are either optimal or acceptable based on the selection methods. The injected faults are detailed in Table 18.

Table 18: Faults Injected for Installation
| Recovery Point | Fault Injected |
|----------------|----------------|
| After Step 2   | Web instance not launched |
| After Step 4   | Database instance not launched |

###### 2) Experimental Results

Table 19 shows the recovery time for the installation operation. The highest relative standard deviation is 2.6%. The execution time of the recovery action selected by the Pareto set search-based optimization method is no greater than other applicable recovery actions. The execution time of the selected recovery action by the user constraints-based optimization method is within the time constraint set by business stakeholders.

Table 19: Recovery Time for Installation
| Recovery Point | Process Step | Errors | Applicable Recovery Patterns | Selected Recovery Action (Pareto Set) | Recovery Time (Pareto Set) | Selected Recovery Action (User Constraints) | Recovery Time (User Constraints) |
|----------------|--------------|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Recovery Point 1 | Launch a web instance | Web instance not launched | RP1, RP3, RP5 | Restart the web instance; Assign elastic IP to the web instance | 55.21 s | Restart the web instance; Assign elastic IP to the web instance | 57.06 s |
| Recovery Point 2 | Launch a database instance | Database instance not launched | RP1, RP3, RP5, RP8 | Restart the database instance; Assign elastic IP to the database instance | 56.43 s | Restart the database instance; Assign elastic IP to the database instance | 58.14 s |

###### 3) Satisfying Recovery Requirement R2

From the results, the recovery for all recovery points in the installation operation takes no more than 60 seconds. Additionally, state capturing time was around 14-15 seconds, applicable recovery patterns filtering time was at most 38 milliseconds, recovery plan generation time was at most 68 milliseconds, and acceptable recovery action selection time was at most 290 milliseconds. Considering error detection times (ranging from 10 ms to 11 seconds), the total error detection and recovery time is around 86 seconds. Thus, the total recovery time for each recovery point is below 86 seconds, ensuring a reasonable RTO.

##### C. Recovery Reducing Negative Impact

###### 1) Experimental Procedure

This requirement concerns the negative impact of recovery on the cloud system. We measure the recovery impact by performing the installation operation on a cloud application. No software is running in the cloud instances during the installation. We use a proprietary fault injection tool to inject faults at the two determined recovery points, automatically determine applicable recovery patterns, and perform recovery using the selected acceptable recovery actions. The injected faults are detailed in Table 20.

Table 20: Faults Injected for Installation
| Recovery Point | Fault Injected |
|----------------|----------------|
| After Step 2   | Web instance not launched |
| After Step 4   | Database instance not launched |

###### 2) Experimental Results

Table 21 shows the recovery impact for the installation operation. Since there is no cloud application running during the installation and recovery, the recovery impact is evaluated to be 0. The highest relative standard deviation is 0%.

Table 21: Recovery Impact for Installation
| Recovery Pattern ID | Recovery Pattern |
|---------------------|------------------|
| RP1                 | Compensated Undo & Redo |
| RP2                 | Compensated Undo & Alternative |
| RP3                 | Rewind & Replay |
| RP4                 | Rewind & Alternative |
| RP5                 | Reparation |
| RP6                 | Direct Redo |
| RP7                 | Farther Undo & Redo |
| RP8                 | Direct Alternative |
