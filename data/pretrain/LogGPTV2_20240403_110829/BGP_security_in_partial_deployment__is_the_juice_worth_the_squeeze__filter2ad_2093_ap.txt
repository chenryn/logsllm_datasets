6.1.1 Collateral Damages
Figure 14. We show how AS 52142, a Polish ISP, suﬀers
from collateral damage when security is 2nd. On the left, we
show the network prior to S*BGP deployment. AS 52142 is
oﬀered two paths, both insecure: a 3-hop path through his
provider AS 5617 to the legitimate destination AS 40426,
and a 5-hop bogus route to the attacker. (The route to m is
really 4 hops long, but m (falsely) claims a link to AS 40426
so AS 52142 thinks it is 5 hops long.) AS 52142 will choose
the legitimate route because it is shorter. On the right, we
show the network after S*BGP deployment. AS 5617 has
become secure and now prefers the secure route through
its neighbor Cogent AS 174. However, AS 5617’s secure
route is 5 hops long (right), signiﬁcantly longer than the 2
hop route AS 5617 used prior to S*BGP deployment (left).
Thus, after S*BGP deployment AS 52142 learns a 6-hop
legitimate route through AS 5617, and a 5-hop bogus route.
Since AS 52142 is insecure, it chooses the shorter route, and
becomes unhappy as collateral damage.
Collateral damages. A source AS s /∈ S obtains collat-
eral damages from an S*BGP deployment S with respect to
an attacker m and destination d if (a) s was happy when the
ASes in T are secure, but (b) s is unhappy when the ASes
in S are secure, and S ⊃ T .
No collateral damages in the security 3rd model: The
collateral damage above occurs because AS 5617 prefers a
longer secure route over a shorter insecure route. This can
also happen in the security 1st model (but see also Ap-
pendix A), but not when security is 3rd. See Table 3.
Theorem 6.1. In the security 3rd model, if an AS s has a
route to a destination d that avoids an attacker m when the
set of secure ASes is S, then s has a route to a destination d
that avoids attacker m for every set of secure ASes in T ⊃ S.
The proof is in Appendix G. The security 3rd model is our
only monotone model; more secure ASes cannot result in
fewer happy ASes, so the metric HM,D(S) grows monotoni-
cally in S.
Fewer immune ASes as security becomes more im-
portant? Collateral damages also explain why the frac-
tion of immune ASes in the security 2nd model in Figure 3
is smaller than the number of happy ASes in the baseline
scenario (Section 4.4). This is because in the security 2nd
model, collateral damages mean that securing some ASes
can actually make other ASes more vulnerable to attack.
6.1.2 Collateral Beneﬁts
Insecure ASes can also become happy as a collateral ben-
eﬁt, because other ASes obtained secure routes:
Figure 14. We show how AS 5166, with the Department
of Defense Network Information Center, obtains collateral
beneﬁts when its provider AS 174, Cogent, deploys S*BGP.
On the left, we show the network prior to the deployment
of S*BGP; focusing on Cogent AS 174, we see that it falls
victim to the attack, choosing a bogus route through its cus-
tomer AS 3491. As a result, AS 5166 routes to the attacker
as well. On the right, we show the network after S*BGP
deployment. Now, both AS 174 and AS 3491 are secure,
and choose a longer secure customer route to the legitimate
destination. As a result, AS 5166, which remains insecure,
becomes happy as a collateral beneﬁt.
Collateral beneﬁts. A source AS s /∈ S obtains collateral
beneﬁts from an S*BGP deployment S with respect to an
attacker m and destination d if (a) s is unhappy when the
ASes in T are secure, but (b) s is happy when the ASes in
S are secure, and S ⊃ T .
Collateral beneﬁts are possible in all three routing policy
models (Table 3). Here is an example when security is 3rd:
Figure 15. We show how AS34223, a Russian ISP, obtains
collateral beneﬁts in the security 3rd model. The left subﬁg-
ure shows how AS34223 and and its provider AS3267 react
to the attack before S*BGP deployment; AS3267 learns two
peer routes of equal length – one bogus route to the at-
tacker m and one legitimate route to Pandora’s AS 40426.
AS3267 then tiebreaks in favor of the attacker, so both

AS3267 and his customer AS34223 become unhappy. On the
right, we show what happens after partial S*BGP deploy-
ment. AS3267 has a secure route to Pandora of equal length
and type as the insecure route to m; so AS3267 chooses the
secure route, and his insecure customer AS34223 becomes
happy as a collateral beneﬁt.
6.2 Root-cause analysis.
Which of the phenomena in Table 3 have the biggest im-
pact on security? We now check how these phenomena play
out in the last step of the Tier 1 & Tier 2 rollout of Sec-
