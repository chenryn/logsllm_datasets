User: How to detect and prevent DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks?
Assistant: 1. Defend with a firewall: A firewall is the first line of defense to protect a network from attack. Firewalls can detect and block illegal traffic, reducing the impact of DDoS attacks. 2. Strengthen network traffic control: A good traffic management strategy can effectively mitigate DDoS attacks. In mission-critical networks, network traffic control techniques should be used to limit traffic. 3. Use an intrusion detection system: An intrusion detection system can detect attacks, monitor traffic and detect unusual activity on the network, helping to identify and mitigate DDoS attacks. 4. Regularly update security patches: Keeping the system updated is an effective way to prevent DDoS attacks. Update operating systems, applications, and security patches to maintain security and integrity. 5. Correctly configured routers and switches: Proper router and switch configurations can improve network security and enhance network reliability and stability. 6. Use CDN technology: Content Delivery Network (CDN) can effectively mitigate DDoS attacks and improve website performance and reliability. 7. Deploy DDoS defense equipment: DDoS defense equipment can automatically start when receiving a DDoS attack, and direct traffic to the protection equipment for filtering, protecting the target server from attacks.
