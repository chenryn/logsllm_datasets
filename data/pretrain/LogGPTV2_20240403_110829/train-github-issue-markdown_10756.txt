To recreate, add the following to `config.yml`:
    twig:
        globals:
            foo: "@@bar"
**Expected behaviour:** Twig has a global variable named `foo` containing the
string `@bar`.
**Actual behaviour:** ServiceNotFoundException: The service "twig" has a
dependency on a non-existent service "@bar".
Environment tested on:
