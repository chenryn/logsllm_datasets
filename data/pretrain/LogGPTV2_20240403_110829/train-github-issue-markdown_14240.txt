Subject: Request for Synchronous Scrolling of Objectives and Information Panel

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide some feedback regarding the usability of our current development environment, specifically in relation to the handling of waypoints and objectives as the codebase grows in size.

While working on a recent project, I encountered an issue where, as my code expanded, the static position of the objectives and information panel on the left side of the screen made it increasingly difficult to keep track of important details while scrolling through the code. This contrasts with the behavior of the phone/app simulation on the right, which scrolls in tandem with the rest of the page content, providing a more integrated and user-friendly experience.

To improve workflow efficiency, especially when dealing with extensive coding tasks, I propose implementing a feature that allows the objectives and information section on the left to scroll synchronously with the main content area, similar to how the right-side panel operates. I believe this adjustment would significantly enhance the overall coding experience by ensuring all relevant information remains accessible without requiring users to constantly switch between different sections of the interface.

For your reference, I have included a video demonstrating the described issue and the proposed solution:

Please note that due to Dropbox's compression, the video quality may not be optimal. However, it should still effectively illustrate the points made above.

Thank you for considering this suggestion. I look forward to any updates or further discussions regarding this matter.

Best regards,
