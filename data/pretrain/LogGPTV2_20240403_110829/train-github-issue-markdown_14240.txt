Hello, today I was doing some waypoints and as my code got longer and longer,
I was unable to keep up with the objectives and info on the left side as I
scrolled down.
Can we get the objectives and info on the left side to scroll with the page
like the phone/app on the right side does? This is very crucial when working
with a lot of code. I have attached a video to exemplify this:

Sorry if the video is bad quality; Dropbox compresses videos a ton.
