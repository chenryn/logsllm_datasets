            some of this content is moved from the mount(8) man page.
            style was based on proc(5) sections.

            the mount options are now described in this page.
    michael kerrisk

        note another case where shared "peer groups" are formed
namespaces.7
    michael kerrisk  [konstantin khlebnikov]
        mention that device id should also be checked when comparing ns symlinks
            when comparing two namespaces symlinks to see if they refer to
            the same namespace, both the inode number and the device id
            should be compared. this point was already made clear in
            ioctl_ns(2), but was missing from this page.
    michael kerrisk
        note an idiosyncrasy of /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children
            /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children has a value only after first
            child is created in pid namespace. verified by experiment.
network_namespaces.7
    michael kerrisk
        network namespaces isolate the unix domain abstract socket namespace
    michael kerrisk
        add cross reference to unix(7)
            for further information on unix domain abstract sockets.
posixoptions.7
    carlos o'donell
        expand xsi options groups
            we define in detail the x/open system interfaces i.e. _xopen_unix

            the xsi options groups include encryption, realtime, advanced
            realtime, realtime threads, advanced realtime threads, tracing,
            streams, and legacy interfaces.
    michael kerrisk
        use a more consistent, less cluttered layout for option lists
    michael kerrisk

            use more consistent layout for lists of functions, and
            remove punctuation from the lists to make them less cluttered.
socket.7
    michael kerrisk  [tomi salminen]
        fix error in so_incoming_cpu code snippet
            the last argument is passed by value, not reference.
time.7
    michael kerrisk  [enrique garcia]
        mention clock_gettime()/clock_settime() rather than [gs]ettimeofday()
            gettimeofday() is declared obsolete by posix. mention instead
            the modern apis for working with the realtime clock.
            see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199049
unix.7
    michael kerrisk  [rusty russell]
        errors: add ebadf for sending closed file descriptor with scm_rights
vdso.7

xattr.7
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add selinux(8)
ld.so.8
    mike frysinger
        make lack of separator escaping explicit
            make it clear that the delimiters in ld_preload, ld_library_path,
            and ld_audit cannot be escaped so people don't try various methods
            (such as \:) to workaround it.
    michael kerrisk
        remove unneeded mention of path in discussion of ld_library_path
            this brief sentence doesn't add value to the text.

new and rewritten pages
-----------------------
s390_guarded_storage.2
    eugene syromyatnikov
        new page documenting s390_guarded_storage(2) s390-specific system call
address_families.7
    michael kerrisk  [eugene syromyatnikov]
        new page that contains details of socket address families
            there is too much detail in socket(2). move most of it into
            a new page instead.
bpf-helpers.7
    michael kerrisk  [daniel borkmann, quentin monnet]
        add new man page for ebpf helper functions
            (autogenerated from kernel source files)
removed pages
-------------
mdoc.7
mdoc.samples.7
    michael kerrisk  [ingo schwarze]
        remove mdoc(7) and mdoc.samples(7)
            groff_mdoc(7) from the groff project provides a better
            equivalent of mdoc.samples(7) and the 'mandoc' project
            provides a better mdoc(7). and nowadays, there are virtually
            no pages in "man-pages" that use mdoc markup.
newly documented interfaces in existing pages

    michael kerrisk
        errors: add einval error for noncanonical clock_settime() value
clone.2
    michael kerrisk
        rework discussion of threads and signals
            the discussion is phrased in terms of signals sent using kill(2),
            but applies equally to a signal sent by the kernel.
    jann horn
        pending clone_newpid prevents thread creation
    michael kerrisk
        clarify the discussion of threads and signals
            and explicitly introduce the terms "process-directed" and
            "thread-directed" signals.
    eugene syromyatnikov
        add information about clone and clone2 on ia-64

eventfd.2
    michael kerrisk
        move text noting that eventfd() creates a fd earlier in the page
fcntl.2
    michael kerrisk
        actual pipe capacity may in practice be less than nominal capacity
            the number of bytes that can be written to the pipe may be less
            (sometimes substantially less) than the nominal capacity.
    eugene syromyatnikov
        mention that l_sysid is not used even if present
    michael kerrisk
        briefly explain the meaning of the 'l_sysid' field in 'struct flock'
futex.2
    benjamin peterson
        make the example use c11 atomics rather than gcc builtins
getcpu.2
    tobias klauser  [michael kerrisk]
        getcpu() now has a glibc wrapper; remove mention of syscall(2)
            the glibc wrapper was added in glibc 2.29, release on 1 feb 2019.
getgid.2
getpid.2

        describe 2nd return value peculiarity
            some architectures (ab)use second return value register for
            additional return value in some system calls. let's describe this.
getgroups.2
    michael kerrisk
        note that a process can drop all groups with: setgroups(0, null)
getrlimit.2
    eugene syromyatnikov
        note that setrlimit(rlimit_cpu) doesn't fail
    michael kerrisk
        resource limits are process-wide attributes shared by all threads
            this was already noted in pthreads(7), but bears repeating here.
    eugene syromyatnikov
        correct information about large limits on 32-bit architectures
gettid.2
    michael kerrisk
        glibc provides a wrapper since version 2.30
