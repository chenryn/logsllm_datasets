776. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we give a new framework for constructing
useful client puzzles (UCPs), which achieves the same level
of security as the previous solution [10, 16]. Our generic con-
struction utilizes comparatively well-understood primitives
such as ID-KEMs and AEs, and is easy to be instantiated
with many good features, e.g., UCPs without random ora-
cles or without pairings.

APPENDIX
A. DEFINITIONS
A.1 Message Authentication Code (MAC)
A message authentication code scheme consists of a pair
of PPT algorithms: Φ = (Mac, Vrfy). The authentication
algorithm Mac takes as input a key sk and a message M ,
and outputs a string tag. The veriﬁcation algorithm Vrfy
takes as input a key sk, a message m, and a string tag and
outputs either “0” or “1”. We require that for all sk and M ,
Vrfysk(m, Macsk(m)) = 1. For simplicity, we assume that
Mac and Vrfy are deterministic.
Cryptographic Countermeature against Connectin
Depletion Attacks. In SNDSS, pages 151–165, 1999.
Definition 7. A message authentication code Φ = (Mac,
Vrfy) is secure, if for any algorithm A, the success probability
78of A in the following experiment is negligible, where
Sucmac
A,Φ(k) = Pr[sk
R
← {0, 1}k; (m, s) ← A(k);
tag ← Macsk(m); (m′, tag′) ← A(tag, s) :
(m′, tag′) 6= (m, tag) ∧ Vrfysk(m′, tag′) = 1]
.
A.2 Pseudorandom Functions (PRFs)
A function ensemble is a sequence F = {FK }K∈N of ran-
dom variables, so that the random variable Fn : {0, 1}k →
{0, 1}n assumes values in the set of functions mapping k-
bit long strings to n-bit long strings. The uniform function
ensemble, denoted H = {HK}K∈N, has HK uniformly dis-
tributed over the set of functions mapping k-bit long strings
to n-bit long strings.
Definition 8. A function ensemble F = {FK }K∈N, is
called pseudorandom if the success probability of any proba-
bilistic polynomial-time oracle machine A is negligible in the
following experiment.
Sucind
A,FK (k) = |Pr(AF
k (1k) = 1) − Pr(AH
k (1k) = 1)|
where Hk = {Hk}k∈N is the uniform function ensemble.
B. PROOF OF THEOREM 3
We give a quantitive result regarding semantic security
of ciphertexts (Lemma 4) and explain that the scheme also
fulﬁll the rest requirements brieﬂy. We prove the semantic
security of ciphertexts based on the DQR assumption in the
random oracle model.
Lemma 4. The above client useful puzzle scheme provides
(2ǫ1 + ǫ2 + ǫ3, t1 + t2 + t3 + poly(k))-semantic security of ci-
phertexts (in the random oracle model) against adptive cho-
sen auxiliary public key attack, provided that the number of
the E O queries are polynomially bounded in k, (ǫ1, t1)-DQR
assumption holds in (G1, G2), the symmetric key authenti-
cated encryption is (ǫ2, t2)-authenticated encryption and the
pseudo-random function is (ǫ3, t3)-secure.
Proof. The lemma follows naturally Theorem 1 and The-
orem 3.2 of [6].
The correctness and information-theoretic puzzle privacy
of the scheme are easily seen. We claim without further
explanation that the requirements of computational inten-
sity, reliability, non-dependability and usefulness are also
satisﬁed. Summarizing all these discussions, we reach the
statement of Theorem 3.
Alternatively one can assume non-standard interactive QR
assumption [6], thus acquire a proof without resorting to
random oracles. We omit the detailed discussions here.
