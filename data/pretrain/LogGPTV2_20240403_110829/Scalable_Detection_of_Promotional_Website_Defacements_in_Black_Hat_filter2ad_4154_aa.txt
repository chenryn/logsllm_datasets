Introduction
Miscreants from online underground economies regularly
exploit website vulnerabilities and inject fraudulent content
into victim web pages to promote illicit goods and services.
Scalable detection of such promotional website defacements
remains an open problem despite their prevalence in Black
Hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) campaigns. Adver-
saries often manage to inject content in a stealthy manner
by obfuscating the description of illicit products and/or the
presence of defacements to make them undetectable. In this
paper, we design and implement DMOS - a Defacement Mon-
itoring System which protects websites from promotional
defacements at scale. Our design is based on two key observa-
tions: Firstly, for effective advertising, the obfuscated jargons
of illicit goods or services need to be easily understood by
their target customers (e.g., sharing similar shape or pronun-
ciation). Secondly, to promote the underground business, the
defacements are crafted to boost search engine ranking of
the defaced web pages while trying to stay stealthy from the
maintainers and legitimate users of the compromised websites.
Leveraging these insights, we ﬁrst follow the human conven-
tion and design a jargon normalization algorithm to map
obfuscated jargons to their original forms. We then develop a
tag embedding mechanism, which enables DMOS to focus
more on those not-so-visually-obvious, yet site-ranking inﬂu-
ential HTML tags (e.g., title, meta). Consequently, DMOS
can reliably detect illicit content hidden in compromised web
pages. In particular, we have deployed DMOS as a cloud-
based monitoring service for a ﬁve-month trial run. It has
analyzed more than 38 million web pages across 7000+ com-
mercial Chinese websites and found defacements in 11% of
these websites. It achieves a recall over 99% with a precision
about 89%. While the original design of DMOS focuses on
the detection of Chinese promotional defacements, we have
extended the system and demonstrated its applicability for
English website defacement detection via proof-of-concept
experiments.

With the development of online underground economies, com-
promising high-ranking vulnerable websites and injecting
fraudulent content to promote illicit goods/ services, e.g., unli-
censed drugs, pornography, counterfeit, and illegal gambling
operations, appears to be a lucrative strategy and thriving
practice [33, 35]. Since search engines drive the majority of
web trafﬁc [26], miscreants often leverage this as a Black Hat
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) technique to promote their
products. In this paper, we refer to such proﬁt-motivated cam-
paigns as promotional website defacements, or defacements
in short. Promotional defacements can inﬂict signiﬁcant harm
on the compromised websites, causing reputational damage,
trafﬁc hijacking, search engine penalty/ blockade, and thus
revenue loss. According to the IMF, the US Internet under-
ground economy is estimated to contribute to 5.4% of its
GDP [28], for which defacements are one of the major promo-
tional channels. Given the substantial economic incentives,
defacements have become increasingly prominent: Between
1998 and 2016, the number of reported incidents per year
grew from a few thousand to more than one million [36].
In some countries, there are regulatory requirements for the
involved parties, e.g. search engines, to detect promotional
defacements so as to thwart the spread of illegal goods and ser-
vices. Unfortunately, promotional defacements remain elusive
and difﬁcult to root out despite their prevalence and consid-
erable damages. For example, Google has to update its page
ranking algorithm against defacements for more than 500
times per year [40].
To tackle this challenge, we decide to build an easy-to-
deploy cloud-based defacement monitoring service. In con-
trast, end-host-based solutions would require software modi-
ﬁcation/ installation on customer web-servers, which hinders
usability and deployability. Note also that one cannot de-
tect defacements by merely tracking changes with respect
to a “gold” (reference) copy of a webpage. This is due to
the dynamic nature of modern web pages, especially those
with user-generated content like posting and follow-up com-

ments. Meanwhile, promotional defacers have advanced be-
yond the use of old black hat SEO tricks such as keyword
stufﬁng and link farming [23]. For example, they have in-
troduced Stealthy Defacement techniques by carefully se-
lecting a few site-ranking inﬂuential regions in a web page
and make tiny modiﬁcations in these regions only. By doing
so, the defacer can keep the illicit content unnoticeable from
law-enforcement ofﬁcials as well as the maintainers/ legiti-
mate users of the compromised website while being indexed
and ranked highly by search engines. Worse still, promoters
of illicit products have evolved to conspire with consumers
searching for such goods to circumvent content-based de-
tection via Keyword Obfuscation: Since it is increasingly
difﬁcult to advertise or search for illicit products based on
their standard names or related keywords, defacers and illicit
goods seekers have developed a vocabulary of jargons, i.e., ob-
fuscated keywords of illicit products, to bypass the blockade
of search engines.
These new evasion techniques have rendered conventional
Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based detection schemes
ineffective due to the following reasons: 1) Although human
subjects can readily understand the obfuscated and constantly
evolving jargons for illicit goods, standard NLP models can-
not recognize those jargons and their intent without retraining.
For instance, while typical NLP models can tell “MARK SIX”
is related to gambling, they cannot infer the context of its
obfuscated form “M4RK SIX”. 2) The context can be very
different and diverse across various content elements (iden-
tiﬁed by their corresponding HTML tags) within a single
web page. For example, a news article within a web page
can be interlaced with not-directly-relevant but legitimate
advertisements. Without explicit modeling of the different se-
mantics associated with each tag, it is easy for a conventional
NLP-based scheme to incorrectly ﬂag legitimate content, e.g.,
embedded advertisements, as defacements. It is also difﬁcult
to pinpoint the small yet illicit snippets introduced by stealthy
defacements without understanding the semantics of each tag.
As a result, it remains challenging, even for ﬁrst-tier search
engines, to detect imperceptible promotional defacements. A
case in point: 36% of popular searches still return at least one
malicious link [29].
In this paper, we present DMOS, an industrial-strength,
scalable monitoring/ detection solution for promotional web-
site defacements. Notice that whatever actions were taken by
the defacers, their objective is to promote the illicit content to
their target consumers via legitimate search engines. This key
observation motivates us to develop a solution based on the
following techniques:
• Tag Embeddings. To advertise the illicit content, defac-
ers need to optimize stealthy defacements (by modify-
ing a few important tags only) to boost the ranking of
the resultant page in search results. Towards this end,
we propose a new tag-embedding model, which follows
search-engine indexing algorithms to focus on text and
tags in the imperceptible yet index-impacting regions of
a web page.
• Jargon Normalization Algorithm (JNA). While defac-
ers and their target customers can craft arbitrary jargons
in theory, they need to be readily understood by human
subjects in practice. Therefore, these jargons often share
similar shapes or pronunciation with the original forms.
We therefore build the ﬁrst full-featured jargon normal-
ization algorithm to facilitate NLP models to understand
the authentic meaning of such obfuscated jargons.
With these two techniques, we design and implement DMOS
to automatically detect promotional defacements in a scal-
able manner. Unlike proof-of-concept studies, DMOS is
production-ready. In fact, DMOS has already been deployed
as a security monitoring service by a key Chinese cyberse-
curity service provider for its enterprise customers. During
the initial months of the deployment of DMOS, it has served
to monitor 7000+ commercial websites by analyzing more
than 38 million web pages and detected defacements among
over 11% of those sites. We have manually veriﬁed the re-
sults, reported them to the site owners, and received their
conﬁrmation. It also enables the uncovering of new types of
defacement techniques. In summary, this paper has made the
following technical contributions:
• New Techniques. We present the ﬁrst industry-ready
tool, DMOS, to enable scalable detection of promotional
website defacements. In particular, we have developed
a set of techniques to neutralize the new evasion tricks
performed by defacers. Our approach of building a tag-
embedding model and normalization of obfuscated char-
acters/jargons can effectively and precisely identify de-
faced web pages. We have conducted large scale testing
with DMOS on more than 38 million Chinese web pages
and performed proof-of-concept experiments on over 30
thousand English web pages.
• Measurement Study. Through collaboration with a key
industrial company, we systematically conduct a large-
scale measurement study on the security of commercial
websites to reveal the characteristics of promotional web-
site defacements and quantify their pervasiveness.
• New Findings. We uncover new types of defacement
techniques/ preferences that enhance our understanding
of the online underground ecosystem. By effectively
catching defacements at their early stage, we substan-
tially raise the bar to thwart large-scale promotional de-
facement campaigns.
• New Dataset. We present a semi-automatic approach
to collect defacement datasets and release an English
defacement dataset [17] to the research community.

2 Background
In this section, we ﬁrst explain why defacements are widely
employed for black hat SEO. We then introduce existing coun-
termeasures taken by search engines against malicious content
and black hat SEO. We also show how seekers of illicit goods
use jargons as search keywords. We then describe the overall
process of promotional website defacements and illustrate
the conspiring acts between the defacers and their target con-
sumers. Finally, we discuss other conventional defacement/
black hat SEO techniques.
2.1 Defacements for Black Hat SEO
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of making
a website more visible to its target audience by boosting its
ranking among the relevant results returned by mainstream
search engines. It is expensive and slow to increase the search-
engine-visibility of a website through legitimate, “organic”
content enhancement. An illegal short-cut is to hack into popu-
lar websites and plant promotional content and referring links
for the illicit pages. Due to its cost-effectiveness, promotional
website defacements have been widely adopted as a means of
black hat SEO.
Defacers can take various approaches to hack into target
websites, including but not limited to SQL injection, remote
command execution (RCE), and social engineering. They
often use recently disclosed vulnerabilities (0-day or N-day)
for batch scanning and exploitation. Sometimes, attackers
only crack the login credentials of the content management
system (CMS) to escalate their privilege to edit articles. Worse
still, defacers may gain command execution access to the
hacked web server and have more ﬂexible or full control of
the website. In the latter case, it is possible to evade detection
2.2 Search Engine Policies
Although the primary goal of search engines is to make web
pages universally accessible, they need to cleanse the search
results to comply with legal/ regulatory requirements as well
as to improve user experience. Certain types of content are
commonly censored by most search engines. These include
sexually explicit materials, pirated contents, solicitation of
illegal services, as well as sensitive personal information [27].
Search results belonging to these categories are either re-
moved upon valid requests or pruned automatically [30].
It is a common practice for search engines to sanitize
their results by critically reviewing any web pages containing
blocked keywords. As such, defacers often use obfuscated
jargons in their promotional content and expect their target
customers to search for their goods/ services using the same
jargons. This can be observed by, e.g., comparing the search
results of MARK SIX (i.e.六合彩) and M4RK SIX (i.e.六台
彩) returned by Microsoft Bing. The ﬁrst term is a blocked
gambling keyword, and the returned search results are all nor-
mal websites. In contrast, the second term is an obfuscated
jargon with a similar shape. In this case, Bing returns a long
list of illegal gambling websites.
2.3 Active Consumers Search for Jargons
Active consumers are users who actively look for the illicit
products they demand. For underground markets, active con-
sumers are prevalent due to the difﬁculty of promoting prod-
ucts via legal channels and scarce supply. Most people ﬁnd
content on the Internet through search engines with relevant
keywords. However, illicit content is not trivially searchable
since search engines usually block related keywords. Active
consumers, who are aware of blocking, have evolved to search
with obfuscated keywords to replace the blocked ones. There
are also cases where consumers need to transform the key-
word in various forms by trial and error until they ﬁnd the de-

During this process, new obfuscated keywords,
i.e., jargons, are coined. Since the rules that consumers use
to obfuscate keywords should be natural and straightforward
to a human subject, most coined jargons can be categorized
into two types: One is homophonic jargon, which replaces the
original word/ character with another of similar pronunciation.
Another is homomorphic jargon, which uses a word/ character
with a similar shape. We discuss these two types of jargons in
detail in Section 3.2.2.
2.4 An Example of a Defacement-Driven Pro-
motional Campaign
Figure 1 shows the walk-through of a defacement-driven pro-
motional campaign for illicit goods/ services. It helps readers
understand both actors’ motivation and rationale: the illicit-
goods-seeking consumer and the defacer who promotes/ of-
fers the goods. The upper part of Figure 1 shows the typical
behavior of a consumer. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the orig-
inal keywords related to illicit content are likely to be blocked
by search engines. The consumer’s natural reaction is to try
other keywords that are not blocked, namely, the so-called
jargons which are obfuscated words/ terms with similar shape
or pronunciation.
Expecting such behavior from their consumers, defacers
would use those jargons for black hat SEO. As described in
