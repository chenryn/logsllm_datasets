User: Python is on my machine, I just don't know where, if I type python in terminal it will open Python 2.6.4, this isn't in it's default directory, there surely is a way of finding it's install location from here?
Assistant: First search for PYTHON IDLE from search bar
Open the IDLE and use below commands.
import sys
print(sys.path)
It will give you the path where the python.exe is installed. For eg:
C:\Users\\...\python.exe
Add the same path to system environment variable.
