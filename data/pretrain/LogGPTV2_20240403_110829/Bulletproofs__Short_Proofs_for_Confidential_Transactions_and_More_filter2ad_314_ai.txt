tractor E as follows. The extractor E runs the prover with
n different values of y, pQ ` 1q different values of z,
and 7 different values of the challenge x. This results in
14 ¨ pQ ` 1q ¨ n valid proof transcripts. The extractor E ﬁrst
runs the extractor EInnerProduct for the inner-product argument
to extract a witness l, r to the inner product argument such
that glhr “ P ^ xl, ry “ t. Using this witness and 3 valid
transcripts with different x challenges, E can compute linear
combinations of (63) in order to extract α, ρ, aL, aR, sL, sR
such that A “ hαgaL haR, as well as S “ hρgsL hsR.
If for any other set of challenges px, y, zq the extractor can
compute a different representation of A or S, then this yields
a non-trivial discrete logarithm relation between independent
generators h, g, h which contradicts the discrete logarithm
assumption.
Using these representations of A and S, as well as l and r,
we then ﬁnd that for all challenges x, y and z

If these equalities do not hold for all challenges and l, r
from the transcript, then we have two distinct representations
of the same group element using a set of independent
generators. This would be a non-trivial discrete logarithm
relation.

The values AI , AO, l, r, μ, τx produced by an honest prover
interacting with an honest veriﬁer are random independent
elements, i.e. if s, ρ, α, τ1,pτiq6
3, ρ as well as x, y, z are
chosen independently and randomly. t is the inner product
of l, r as in any verifying transcript. The simulated S is
fully deﬁned by equations (85). The honestly produced T
are perfectly hiding commitments and as such random group
elements. Their internal relation given t and τx is fully
deﬁned by equation (83), which is ensured by computing
T1 accordingly. Therefore, the transcript of the proof is
identically distributed to an honestly computed proof with
uniformly selected challenges. The simulator runs in time
OpVq and is thus efﬁcient.
In order to prove special soundness we construct an extractor
E as follows. The E runs the prover with n different y,
pQ`1q different z and 7 different x challenges. This results
in 14 ¨ pQ ` 1q ¨ n valid proof transcripts. E takes 3 valid
transcripts for x “ x1, x2, x3 and ﬁxed y and z. From the

Appendix F.
Proof of Theorem 4
Proof. Completeness follows from the completeness of the
underlying protocols. Zero-knowledge follows from the fact
that l and r can be efﬁciently simulated, and because the
simulator can simply run Protocol 2 given the simulated
witness pl, rq. The protocol also has a knowledge-extractor,
as the extractor of the range proof can be extended to
extract l and r by calling the extractor of Protocol 2.
The extractor uses Opn3q valid transcripts in total, which
is polynomial in λ if n “ Opλq. The extractor is thus
efﬁcient and either extracts a discrete logarithm relation or
a valid witness. However, if the generators g, h, g, h are
independently generated, then ﬁnding a discrete logarithm
relation between them is as hard as breaking the discrete
log problem. If the discrete log assumption holds in G
then a computationally bounded P cannot produce discrete-
logarithm relations between independent generators. The
proof system is therefore computationally sound.

If these equalities do not hold for all challenges and l, r

We now show that t2 indeed has the form described in
(105). For a given y, z the extractor takes 7 transcripts with
different x’s and uses linear combinations of equation (83) to
compute pτi, tiq, i P r1, 3, . . . , 6s such that Ti “ gti hτi. Note
