There are pitfalls when using the watch + list pattern. Many of our
controllers use this pattern, and we expect many future pieces of code to use
this pattern. Therefore, we'd like to provide a framework/example which lets
you fill out three functions (list, watch, and process) to get a shiny new
bug-free (at least the list+watch part) controller.
This can be modeled after/mostly copied from the scheduler.
