**ATT&CK ID:** S0603  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Stuxnet

Stuxnet uses the `s7blk_findfirst` and `s7blk_findnext` API calls in `s7otbxdx.dll` to enumerate and parse System Data Blocks (SDBs). The malware specifically searches for an SDB with a DWORD value at offset 50h equal to 0100CB2Ch, indicating that the system is using the Profibus communications processor module CP 342-5.

Additionally, Stuxnet looks for and counts specific values within the SDBs:
- **7050h**: This value is associated with the part number KFC750V3, which corresponds to a frequency converter drive (also known as a variable frequency drive) manufactured by Fararo Paya, based in Tehran, Iran.
- **9500h**: This value is linked to Vacon NX frequency converter drives, produced by Vacon, a company based in Finland.

Stuxnet was designed to target specific CPU models, including:
- **6ES7-315-2 (Series 300)**: These CPUs must have special system data block characteristics for sequences A or B.
- **6ES7-315-2 (for sequence C)**: The PLC type can also be verified using the `s7ag_read_szl` API.

These targeted systems and components were carefully selected to ensure the malware's effectiveness in its intended environment.
