are able to achieve with 90% True Positive (TP) rate, 10%
False Positive (FP) rate and an overall accuracy of 90% in
forecasting security incidents. In summary, these approaches
learn the attack history from previous events (e.g., historical
compromise data) and use the acquired knowledge to predict
future ones. They don’t provide thorough investigations on
how security events evolve over time.
Alert correlation. Alert correlation [7, 45] refers to a pro-
cess that analyzes the alert logs produced by IDS and forms
higher-level information on attempted intrusions. Once alerts
are correlated among multiple monitors, the results can pro-
vide IDS a holistic view of the network monitored. A lot of
work has been done in this areas such CRIM [7], DIDMA [19],
ACARM [44], INDRA [17], etc. Vasilomanolakis et al. [45]
summarized the current state of the art in the area of dis-
tributed and collaborative intrusion detection. In contrast to
this previous work, this paper focuses on understanding the
emergence, the evolution, and the characteristics of attack
steps in relation to the wider context in which they are ex-
ploited.
Automated causality analysis. Causality is an orthogo-
nal but interesting problem relating to ATTACK2VEC. Her-
cule [34] uses tainted path s from t to model the causality.
SteamSpot [28] uses a new similarity function to compare
graphs and builds information ﬂow graph clusters to detect
anomalies. NoDoze [15] builds provenance graph of a given
event and use a novel diffusion algorithm to efﬁciently prop-
agate and aggregate the anomalous scores. HOLMES [31]
also leverages provenance graph and identify APT attacks
via information ﬂow graphs. Conversely, our goal is to pro-
vide a reliable new method for analyzing attack trends than
frequency analysis.
Closest work. One of the closest work to this paper is Dark-
Embed [43]. It used paragraph vector to learn low dimen-
sional distributed representations, i.e., embeddings, of dark-
web/deepweb discussions. These embeddings effectively cap-
tured the meaning of these discussions and their other charac-
teristics, such as language, and indicator words. DarkEmbed
then trained a classiﬁer to recognize posts discussing vul-
nerabilities that would be exploited in the wild. DarkEmbed
is essentially a NLP analysis. Different from DarkEmbed,
our work focuses on using representation vectors to param-
eterize the conditional probabilities of security events in the
context of other events, and study how these security events
evolve from a temporal perspective. Another closest work
is [29]. The authors carried out a longitudinal analysis of
a large corpus of cyber threat descriptions. It quantiﬁes the
severity and types (e.g., worms, viruses and trojans) of 12,400
threats detected by Symantec’s AV and 2,700 attacks detected
by Symantec’s IPS. Different from [29], our work focuses
on how the security events evolve and monitor how security
events are exploited in the wild from real-world intrusion
prevention data.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we showed that techniques that were devel-
oped in the area of natural language processing can be used
to effectively model and monitor the evolution of cyberat-
tacks. To demonstrate this, we developed ATTACK2VEC, a
tool that leverages word embeddings to understand the con-
text in which attack steps are exploited. We showed that AT-
TACK2VEC is effective in ﬂagging changes in the way attacks
unfold. In future work we plan to investigate how the use of
ATTACK2VEC could make the work of security analysts easier
in studying emerging attacks.
