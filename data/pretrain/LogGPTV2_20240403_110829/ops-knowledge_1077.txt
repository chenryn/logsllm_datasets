User: I have written a Python script that checks a certain e-mail address and passes new e-mails to an external program.  How can I get this script to execute 24/7, such as turning it into daemon or service in Linux.  Would I also need a loop that never ends in the program, or can it be done by just having the code re executed multiple times?
Assistant: If you are using terminal(ssh or something) and you want to keep a long-time script working after you log out from the terminal, you can try this:
screen
apt-get install screen
create a virtual terminal inside( namely abc): screen -dmS abc
now we connect to abc: screen -r abc
So, now we can run python script: python keep_sending_mails.py
from now on, you can directly close your terminal, however, the python script will keep running rather than being shut down

Since this keep_sending_mails.py's PID is a child process of the virtual screen rather than the
  terminal(ssh)

If you want to go back check your script running status, you can use screen -r abc again
