**Abstract:**
The Internet of Services (IoS) introduces new business and technological models that can fundamentally change how everyday services are provided and contracted. Within the IoS, services that were traditionally not based on established science and operated without a systematic approach will be digitalized using proper methodologies, standards, and tools. The digital specification of these services will enable their trading over the Internet via electronic marketplaces. This paper makes four main contributions to IoS research: 
1. A definition and characterization of IoS-based services.
2. The role and importance of platform services in the IoS.
3. The challenges of managing Service Level Agreement (SLA) dependencies between IoS-based services in compositions.
4. A model-based approach for service engineering to design IoS-based services.

## 1. Introduction

In modern industrialized countries, the service sector is a dominant part of the economy, employing a significant portion of the workforce [13]. While the first services were delivered by humans to humans, advances in computer systems over the past six decades have enabled computers to deliver services to humans. Information technology (IT) has significantly contributed to the evolution of services, with each generation of innovation creating solutions that automate activities previously performed by humans [10].

For example, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), introduced in the 1970s, allowed banks to reduce costs by decreasing the need for tellers. Despite the high cost of IT in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the cost of automated processing with ATMs was less than the expenditure of hiring and training tellers. In this case, a specialized machine was developed to perform tasks once executed by humans. As technology advanced, the number of workers required for many activities gradually decreased. Today, a wide range of services is being replaced by automated machines. For instance, purchasing train tickets, which traditionally required queuing at an office, can now be done through automated dispensers, enabling faster and more convenient travel.

The historical evolution of services is not limited to the automation of tasks. The emergence of the Internet, combined with the World Wide Web, has facilitated remote and generalized interactions between humans and computers. Technological developments in the late 1990s led to the concept of Web services, which support interoperable computer-to-computer interactions over data networks. These services needed to be autonomous and platform-independent, described, published, discovered, and orchestrated using standard protocols to build distributed solutions. The focus was on defining interfaces from a technical and programming perspective, with the goal of enabling enterprise transaction systems, resource planning systems, and customer management systems to be accessed programmatically through a digital network.

The IoS takes these developments a step further. While the use of services (i.e., Web services) has been primarily restricted to IT professionals and IT departments within organizations, the IoS aims to investigate and develop new theories, models, architectures, and technologies that enable non-professional users to create, trade, and consume services. The notion of service in the IoS is not limited to IT-based or technical services but also includes real-world or day-to-day services. This broader spectrum of services necessitates a methodical study of how these services can be represented and modeled digitally.

This paper explores four key topics for the IoS:
1. The evolution of the concept of service, its economic value, and the major characteristics of IoS-based services.
2. A taxonomy for the various platform services that will be available to providers and used to design and operate IoS-based services.
3. The support for managing SLA dependencies, particularly in IoS-based services with process compositions.
4. A model-based approach for designing IoS-based services, which is part of the lifecycle of Service Engineering and relies on the integration of models describing various facets of IoS-based services using efficient matching algorithms.

## 2. The Concept, Value, and Characteristics of Services

Research in service science can often lead to confusion due to the different meanings attributed to the term "service" by various communities. To avoid ambiguity, this section clarifies key concepts associated with the term "service." It also reviews the value that IoS-based services can bring to global economies and the intrinsic characteristics of services compared to products.

### 2.1 The Concept of Service

Baida et al. [3] identified that the terms "service," "e-service," and "Web service" address related concepts from different domains, including computer science, information science, and business science.

- **Computer Science:** In this field, the terms "service," "e-service," and "Web service" generally refer to an autonomous software component uniquely identified by a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) and accessible using standard Internet protocols such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Hullet et al. [6] defined an e-service as a collection of network-resident software services accessible via standardized protocols, whose functionality can be automatically discovered and integrated into applications or composed to form more complex services.
- **Information Science:** Here, services are a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes without the ownership of specific costs and risks [8]. Outcomes are created from the execution of tasks or activities under a set of constraints.
- **Business Science:** In this context, a service is a set of intangible activities that generally occur in interactions between a provider and a consumer. The focus is on evaluating and improving the consumer experience, rather than on standards, protocols, or software.

To craft a common frame of reference, it is necessary to understand the terms associated with the concept of service. Figure 1 illustrates the most relevant terms: real-world services (day-to-day services), e-services, Web services, and, more recently, IoS-based services. We introduce the term "IoS-based service" to differentiate a new type of service that will be represented with digital structures, specifications, and standards for trading on the Internet of Services.

- **Real-World Service:** This term refers to any type of service found in society. Kotler [7] defines a service as any activity or benefit that one party can give to another, which is essentially intangible and does not result in the ownership of anything. Payne [11] describes a service as an activity with an element of intangibility, involving interaction with the customer or the customer's property.
- **E-Services:** E-services are services that use data networks, such as the Internet, as a channel for consumers to interact with remote services. Any service can be transformed into an e-service if it can be invoked via a data network. The definition of e-service is broad, with the primary requirement being remote invocation and interaction using a data network.
- **Web Services:** Web services allow software applications to communicate easily, independent of the underlying computing platform and language. They are less complex than previous solutions for creating interoperable distributed systems. Earlier technologies, such as Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), and Java Remote Method Invocation (JRMI), had drawbacks like incompatibility across vendor implementations and high complexity and cost.
- **IoS-Based Service:** This term identifies services provided through the Internet. Two main characteristics distinguish IoS-based services from previous services: they are not limited to IT-based services but also include real-world or day-to-day services, and their stakeholders, from both the provisioning and consumption sides, include non-IT professionals. IoS-based services serve a dual purpose: they can be used directly by consumers and can also be invoked by technical systems to access business functionality provided remotely by business providers. An IoS-based service model defines a provision-oriented and service-centric view, separating characteristics into business, operational, and technical perspectives. Unlike previous approaches, which were mainly implemented as pieces of software (e.g., Web services), developing solutions for the IoS is more elaborate because real-world services have specific characteristics. IoS-based services combine and correlate business, operational, and IT aspects into service descriptions.

### 2.2 The Economic Value of Services

The intense competition in economies and the globalization of worldwide markets, combined with the generalization and expansion of Information Systems (IS) and IT, have opened significant opportunities for the creation of new specialized services. Services are becoming increasingly productized, with providers focusing on them for differentiation and the creation of consumer value as a source of competitive advantage.

Recently, the concept of service has gained renewed importance following the European Parliament's approval of the service directive [1], which aims to enhance competition by removing restrictions on cross-border market access for services in Europe. The implications for businesses and the IT community are substantial, as the service sector represents more than 70% of the Gross National Product, and the directive could increase service consumption in the European Union by 0.6% (37 billion Euros) [2]. Figure 2 illustrates the gross value added by services in Germany in 2005, provided by the Statistisches Bundesamt. In Germany, the service sector represents 69.4% of the gross value added.

Services appear to be the new hub for most economies. Infrastructure services such as transportation and communication are fundamental building blocks linking all other sectors. One of the largest and most important providers of services in most countries is the government, which operates in sectors such as water management, public safety, and basic healthcare.

Given the economic value and importance of services, a key question is how the Internet can provide a solution to create and enable a genuine market for the trade of cross-border services. As the Internet is now an integral part of worldwide societies, economies, and commerce, it can intuitively provide a fundamental infrastructure for realizing the IoS.

### 2.3 Intrinsic Characteristics of Services

Before proposing or building a solution for the IoS and IoS-based services, it is essential to understand the intrinsic characteristics of services.
