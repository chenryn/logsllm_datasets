1 Introduction
Nowadays, all industrialized countries have become service-based economies in
termsofthedistributionofthepeopleemployedintheservicesector[13].While
thefirstserviceswerecertainlydeliveredbyhumanstohumans,theadvancesin
computersystemsoverthepastsixtyyearsallowedcomputerstodeliverservices
to humans. Information technologies (IT) have significantly contributed to the
evolution of services. Over the years, each generation of innovation has created
solutions that enable to automatically execute activities that were once done by
human beings [10].
For example, Automated Teller Machines (ATM), introduced in the 70s, en-
abled banks to reduce costs by decreasing the need for tellers. Even with the
expensivecostofITinthelate70sandearly80s,thecostofautomatedprocess-
ing with ATM was less than the expenditure of hiring and training a teller to
carryoutthesameactivity.Inthiscase,acomplexandspecializedmachinewas
developed to perform the same activity once executed by a human. As technol-
ogy brought the automation to sophisticated machines, the number of workers
required to execute many activities was gradually reduced. Nowadays, a broad
spectrum of services is being replaced by automated machines. For example,
undertaking a trip by train has traditionally required passengers to purchase a
ticket from an office and show it for inspection when required by the train op-
erator. As a response to technological development, automated dispensers have
2
reduced the need to queue in order to purchase a ticket before a trip and, there-
fore, enable faster journeys.
The historical perspective and evolution of services has not only been con-
finedtotheuseofmachinestoautomateservices.TheemergenceoftheInternet,
allied with the World Wide Web, has allowed a remote and generalized inter-
action between humans and computers. The technological developments in the
late 90s have pushed the notion of service to Web service with the objective
of supporting interoperable computer-to-computer interactions over a data net-
work.Thistypeofinteractionrequiredservicestobeautonomousandplatform-
independent, and needed services to be described, published, discovered and
orchestrated using standard protocols for the purpose of building distributed
solutions. The emphasis was on the definition of interfaces from a technical and
programming perspective. The objective was on distributed systems communi-
cation, since Web services provide a technological solution to enable enterprise
transaction systems, resource planning systems and customer management sys-
tems to be accessed programmatically through a digital network.

(i.e. Web services) has been restricted to IT professionals and to IT depart-

develop new theories, models, architectures and technologies to provide efficient
and effective solutions that enable also non-professional users to create, trade
and consume services. Furthermore, the notion of service is not limited to IT-
based or technical services, but also to real world or day-to-day services. This

tackles the support for managing SLA dependencies with a focus on IoS-based
services that have a process composition in their backend. The violation of a
particular SLA contract in a composition can affect related SLA and, therefore,
dependencies and their impact need to be studied. Finally, the last topic cov-
ers the design of IoS-based services using a model-based approach. The design
method proposed is part of the lifecycle of Service Engineering and relies on
the integration of models that describe the various facets of a IoS-based service
using efficient matching algorithms.

2 The Concept, Value and Characteristics of Services
Research in service science can often lead to confusion due to the simple fact
that different communities use the same term to refer to conceptually distinct
services.Toavoidanyambiguity,thissectionwillclarifykeyconceptsassociated
with the term service upfront. The value that IoS-based services can bring to
worldwideeconomiesandtheintrinsiccharacteristicsofserviceswhencompared
to products will also be reviewed.
2.1 The Concept of Service
Baida et al. [3] have identified that the terms service, e-service and Web ser-
vice actually address related concepts from different domains such as computer
science, information science and business science.
Incomputerscience,thetermsservice,e-serviceandwebservicearegenerally

byauniversalresourceidentifier(URI)andthatcanbeaccessedusingstandard
Internetprotocols,suchasthesimpleobjectaccessprotocol(SOAP)andthehy-
pertexttransferprotocol(HTTP),andlanguagessuchastheextensiblemarkup
language(XML).Hulletal.[6]haveusedtheterme-servicetodescribethefunc-
tionalities and characteristics of a Web service. They have defined an e-service
as a collection of network-resident software services accessible via standardized
protocols,whosefunctionalitycanbeautomaticallydiscoveredandintegratedinto
applicationsorcomposedtoformmorecomplexservices. Ininformationscience,
services are a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes
the customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs and risks
[8]. Outcomes are created from the execution of tasks or activities under a set
of constraints. In business science, a service is a set of intangible activities that
generally take place in interactions between a provider and a consumer. The
emphasis is not on standards, protocols or software, but on the study of how
consumer experience with services can be evaluated and improved.
A deeper understanding of the terms associated to the concept of service
is necessary in order to conceptually craft a common frame of reference. Such
a shared understanding will help stakeholders involved in building enterprise
wide solutions based on services for the IoS. Therefore, there is the need to
identify the terms most often associated with the concept of service that have
been introduced over time by the research community and by the industry. The
four most relevant terms, illustrated in Figure 1, are real world services (day-
to-day services), e-services, Web services and, more recently, IoS-based services.
We introduce the term IoS-based service to differentiate a new type of service
that will be represented with digital structures, specifications and standards to
be traded on the Internet of Services.
Real world service. The term real world service (i.e., a day-to-day service or
simply a service) is used to refer to any type of service that can be found in
society. Because of their diversity and heterogeneity, real world services, have
4
Fig.1. Terms most frequently associated with the concept of service
traditionally been difficult to define. Kotler [7] defines a service as any activity
or benefit that one party can give to another that is essentially intangible and
does not result in the ownership of anything. Its production may or may not
be tied to a physical product. For Payne [11], a service is an activity that has
an element of intangibility associated with it and which involves the service
provider’s interaction either with the customers or with the property belonging
to the customer.

services, the definition of e-service is fairly broad. The main requirement is that
theservicemustallowaremoteinvocationandinteractionusingadatanetwork
as a communication channel. The specification of a service from a business and
technical perspective is not mandatory.
Web services. Web services allow software applications to easily communi-
cate, independently of the underlying computing platform and language. The
use of Web services is substantially less complex than the use of prior solutions
for creating interoperable distributed systems. Heterogeneous, autonomous and
distributed applications have been a vital field since computing shifted from
jobsrunningoncentralizedmainframecomputerstonetworkedcomputers.Pre-
vious technologies that covered the same objectives as Web services included
Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Common Object Request Broker Architecture
(CORBA), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Java Remote
MethodInvocation(JRMI).Thesetechnologieshaddrawbacksthatwereconsid-

eredsignificantwhendevelopingdistributedapplication,suchasincompatibility
across vendors’ implementations, and complexity and cost of solutions.
IoS-based service. The term ”IoS-based service” is used to identify services
provided through the Internet. Two main characteristics make IoS-based ser-
vices distinct from previous services. On the one hand, this notion of service is
not limited to IT-based services, but also to real world or day-to-day services.
On the other hand, the stakeholders of such services, from the provisioning and
consumption side, are not only IT professionals but also non-professional users.
As a result, IoS-based services serve a dual purpose since they can be utilized
directly by consumers, but they can also be invoked by technical systems to ac-
cessbusinessfunctionalitywhichisprovidedremotelybybusinessproviders.An
IoS-basedservicemodeldefinesaviewonservicesthatisprovision-orientedand
service-centric. An important feature of a digital service model is a separation
of characteristics in terms of business, operational and technical perspectives.
Compared to previous approaches to support services – which were mainly
implemented as pieces of software (e.g. Web services) – developing solutions
for the IoS is more elaborate since real world services have very specific char-
acteristics. While e-services and Web services are seen mainly as technological
entities, the Internet of Services will take the representation of services one step
further. IoS-based services will combine and correlate business, operational and
IT aspects into service descriptions.
2.2 The Economical Value of Services
The intense competition of economies and the globalization of worldwide mar-
kets in conjunction with the generalization and expansion of IS and IT have
opened up significant opportunities for the conception of new specialized ser-
vices. Services are becoming quickly more productized. Providers are focusing
on services for increased differentiation and creation of consumer value as a
source of competitive advantage.
Recently, the concept of service has acquired a renewed importance since
after several years of public debate, the European Parliament has approved the
service directive [1]. This directive intends to enhance competition by removing
restrictions on cross-border market access for services in Europe. The implica-
tions of this measure for businesses and the IT community are enormous since
the service sector represents more than 70% of the Gross National Product and
thedirectivecan amplifythe consumptionofservicesinthe EuropeanUnionby
0.6% (37 billion Euros) [2]. Figure 2 illustrates the gross value added of services

service sector represents 69.4% of the gross value added.

now an integral ingredient of the fabric of worldwide societies, economies and
commerce, it can intuitively provide a fundamental infrastructure to enable the
realization of the IoS.
