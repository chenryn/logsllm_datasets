User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I have two users working in one session on Windows 2008 R2 over RDP? I'm looking for a way where two users can work off one VPS running Windows 2008 R2. The goal is to have all of the programs being shared, and viewed together - I guess like remote control. They need to both be able to log in/log out and pickup where they left off.

I've enabled multiple RDP connections to one user, and I've tried using Remote desktop where Admin1 starts a session, and Admin2 will remote control Admin1. This works until Admin1 logs off, which disconnects Admin2 from the session.

The point is, I need a session to be logged in 24/7 by a user so that my automation program can work 24/7 (it requires the GUI to be present so that it can perform automatic mouse clicks and such).

Assistant: It sounds like you'll need a different protocol instead of (or in addition to) RDP.

If you're dead-set on RDP, see if you can get the remote assistance feature working, which should do most of what you want.

If you're not dead-set on RDP, use a different protocol, such as VNC, to share the screen.
