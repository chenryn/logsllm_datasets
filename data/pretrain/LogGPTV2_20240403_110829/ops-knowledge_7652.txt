User: Is there a way to override all file operations in Python? File operations such as 'open', 'os.rename' and 'os.unlink'.
I want to create a temporary, in-memory file system without rewriting a library. Does anyone know of a script or a library that has this feature? I want to run a library on Google App Engine and it is not possible to write to the file system.
Assistant: If you want to write the code of your own file system from scratch, one way or another you will end up rewriting a library.
I have no knowledge of any library implementing an in-memory temporary file system in pure Python. As an alternative, in Linux you can use the tmpfs file system, usually mounted on /dev/shm. You can open, read and write files there as usual.
