 **Stuart Gunter** opened **SPR-9226** and commented
In certain circumstances, the response is committed before the Interceptor
postHandle method is invoked. This appears to be caused when the HandlerMethod
is annotated with `@ResponseBody`.
Steps to reproduce:
  1. Create a Controller method annotated with `@ResponseBody`.
  2. Configure an Interceptor for this path (or all path mappings)
  3. Submit a request to the path above, with a breakpoint set in the Interceptor's postHandle method.
  4. Check the value of response.isCommitted()
Expected:  
Response should not be committed
Actual:  
Response is committed.
Implications:  
Interceptors are unable to modify the response for `@ResponseBody`
HandlerMethods. This prevents Interceptors from being able to add headers to
the response.

**Issue Links:**
  * #20595 StringHttpMessageConverter flush out response immediately before execute posthandler ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
  * #14614 Make `@RequestMapping` inject the negotiated MediaType
  * #15486 Provide better intercepting model for controllers returning `@ResponseBody` ( _ **"is superseded by"**_ )
