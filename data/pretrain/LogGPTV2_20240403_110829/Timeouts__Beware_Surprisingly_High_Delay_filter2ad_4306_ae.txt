### Application Traffic Analysis

We considered two primary explanations for the observed latency: persistent high latency due to oversized queues associated with low-bandwidth links, or temporary, initial high latency due to MAC-layer time slot negotiation or device wake-up. In this section, we find that the latter explanation is more likely, which is qualitatively consistent with prior investigations of GPRS performance characteristics [4], but shows quantitatively more significant delay.

#### Figure 12: Initial and Subsequent Latency Differences
- **Bottom Panel**: The difference between the initial latency and the second probe latency. Values around 1 indicate both responses arrive at about the same time, while values near zero indicate similar round-trip times (RTTs).
- **Top Panel**: The probability that, given the RTT difference (RTT1 - RTT2) on the x-axis, RTT1 is greater than the maximum of the subsequent RTTs (RTT2...RTTn).

### Data Extraction and Filtering
We extracted 236,937 IP addresses from the 20150206 ISI dataset (February 2015), including all addresses with a median RTT of at least one second. To select only responsive addresses with high latency, we sent two pings, separated by five seconds, with a timeout of 60 seconds. We excluded 151,769 addresses that did not respond to either ping and 1,994 addresses that responded within an average of 200ms.

Of the remaining 83,174 addresses, we waited approximately 80 seconds before sending ten pings, once per second, with the same 60-second timeout. We then classified how the RTT of the first ping (RTT1) differed from the subsequent pings (RTT2...RTTn). For 51,646 addresses, the first response took longer than the maximum of the rest, suggesting that roughly 2/3 of high latency observations are due to negotiation or wake-up rather than random latency variation or persistent congestion.

### Patterns of Latency and Loss
We observed distinct patterns of latency and loss near high latency responses, classifying all 5,149 pings above 100 seconds from the sample. These patterns include:
- **Low Latency, Then Decay**: Initial low latency followed by a gradual increase.
- **Loss, Then Decay**: Initial packet loss followed by a gradual decrease in latency.
- **Sustained High Latency and Loss**: Continuous high latency with intermittent losses.
- **High Latency Between Loss**: A single high-latency ping preceded and followed by packet loss.

Table 7 summarizes the occurrences of each pattern, showing the number of pings, instances, and unique addresses for each pattern. The majority of events and addresses fall under "Loss, then decay," but "Sustained high latency and loss" involves almost twice as many pings.

### Summary of High Latencies
High latencies appear to be primarily associated with cellular Autonomous Systems, though a few also occur on satellite links. Regularly high latencies (above one second) in the ISI data seem to be caused by the first-ping behavior, where the initial ping in a stream has higher latency than the rest. Egregiously high latencies (greater than 100 seconds) occur in two main patterns:
1. **Decay Pattern**: Latencies steadily decrease with each probe, as if clearing a backlog.
2. **Sustained Pattern**: Continuously high latencies accompanied by loss, suggesting network oversubscription.

### Conclusions and Discussion
Researchers use tools like ping to detect network outages, but the choice of timeout can affect the accuracy and timeliness of outage detection. If the timeout is too small, the detector may falsely report an outage during congestion; if too large, it may delay reporting. Our investigation of the ISI survey dataset suggests that high latencies are not artifacts of measurement choices and are often due to initial communication with cellular devices. This data should help researchers design probing methods to account for these behaviors.

Our initial hypothesis was that widely used timeout values would be adequate, but our findings suggest using a method similar to TCP: send another probe after 3 seconds and continue listening for a response for at least 60 seconds. We plan to use 60 seconds when a timeout is needed and avoid timeouts otherwise.
