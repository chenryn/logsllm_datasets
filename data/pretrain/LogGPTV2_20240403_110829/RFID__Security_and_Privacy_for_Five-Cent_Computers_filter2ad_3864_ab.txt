2.3.1 Supply Chain Management and Inventory Control
Perhaps the driving force behind the widespread adoption of RFID technology is
supply chain management and manufacturing logistics. RFID technology presents
a major improvement over bar-code technology in a number of ways. In addition
to their small size which allows them to implant within objects, RFID tags can be
scanned in large numbers, without the need for line-of-sight as in optical readers.
RFID technology can improve product “visibility” and help combat theft at vari-
ous stages in the supply chain: Readers can gather information about the location
of goods as they travel from manufacturers, to warehouses or distribution centers,
and eventually to stores. Access to more accurate information about the location of
products in the various stages of the distribution chain allows retailers to keep what
they need in stock, thus avoiding costly delays in delivery/manufacture of items, as
well as helping increase sales by ensuring that shelves are always stocked.
This potential for lowering the operational cost in the supply chain is what moti-
vates major retail stores such as Wall-Mart [1] or government agencies such as the
US Dept. of Defense [2] to adopt UHF RFID tags and require their suppliers to put
electronic tags in the pallets and packing cases they deliver to them. In summary,
there is considerable momentum behind RFID adoption by major retailers which
will also have an impact on smaller companies and customers as well.
2.3.2 Access Control
Another important area of application of the RFID technology is authentication and
access control. Replacing keys with electronic cards or budges has a number of
advantages. The primary one is that cards are more difﬁcult to forge and can be
revoked more easily when compromised or lost than having to change the lock as is
the case for mechanical keys. Additionally, this method provides for better control
and knowledge of the people present in a particular area, which may be helpful in
emergency situations.
RFID-based keys are also used in automobiles where the goal is to make theft
harder. A car equipped with a reader will only start if both the mechanical key and
the unique RFID tag are present. The lack of the correct electronic tag will prevent
the vehicle from starting up, thus serving as an immobilizer. The car can start only
when the tag correctly replies to a challenge sent by a reader. Thus the requirement
that both a physical key and an RFID interaction are present is what makes theft a
harder task.

2.3.3 Automatic Payments
T. Dimitriou
There are many instances where RFID tags can be used for making electronic pay-
ments. Perhaps the simplest one is their use in automated toll collection. A small
plaque placed in the windshield of a car is interacting with a reader at the tollbooth
to automatically collect fares and debit a prepaid account every time the tag ID is
detected. The system is designed so that it can operate at relatively high speeds, thus
helping reduce trafﬁc jams, especially at peak commuting hours.
Electronic tickets is another application of RFID technology. An RFID-based
ticket is a prepaid token that provides access to some facility or a resource. The
ticket can be validated as the user passes through a reader and even be renewed
electronically, thus allowing for greater convenience and eliminating the need for
printed tickets.
2.3.4 People and Pets
Human implantation of RFID tags dates back to at least 1998, when Kevin Warwick,
professor of Cybernetics at the University of Reading, implanted an RFID tag above
his left elbow, which he used to control doors, computers around his ofﬁce. In 2004,
VeriChip had a tag approved for implantation in people. The idea is to offer rapid,
secure patient identiﬁcation, helping at-risk patients get the right treatment when
needed most. By scanning the tag, doctors can identify a patient and access personal
medical information even if a person is admitted to a hospital unconscious. Other
uses include controlled access to restricted areas. Such access had already found
application in certain clubs that use them to let their members bill drinks directly to
their accounts and gain access to VIP areas.
While human implantation has some profound ethical and privacy implications
(for example, Scott Silverman, CEO of VeriChip, proposed in an interview implant-
ing chips in immigrants to assist the US government in later identifying them [6]),
animal implantation is already a reality. Dairy farms use RFID tags to monitor the
status of each animal (amount of food, medication, identity) as well as the owner-
ship and medical history to protect against infectious diseases. Owners of pets tag
their animals so that when lost, authorities can scan the tag and identify the owner’s
name and address. While stray animals often lose their collars, this seems to be un-
likely with subdermal tags (but do you see how this can lead to possible violation of
the owner’s privacy?).
2.3.5 Authenticity of Money and Drugs
Adding RFID to banknotes is seen as an automatic way of validating their authentic-
ity and helping reduce counterfeiting (the European Central Bank allegedly had such
plans for high denomination Euro banknotes [7]). However, adding a unique ID that
is readable everywhere increases the chances of tracking and violation of privacy.

This is because tagged banknotes can be easily tracked between transactions, thus
providing information about where people spend their money.
Another area of using RFID tags to enhance authenticity is in pharmaceutical
products. But in today’s era where anybody can purchase medication over the In-
ternet, can we be sure that the products we buy are authentic and safe for use?
Antitamper proof packaging together with hard-to-forge RFID tags may be a solu-
tion to the problem. However, again many privacy issues arise since a person can be
scanned for the medicine he/she carries thus revealing possible medical conditions
and health problems. This information then can be of value to insurance companies
and employers.
2.3.6 Passports
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a body run by the United
Nations recently set a mandate for incorporating RFID tags into passports [8]. These
electronic passports have already been deployed in many European countries, USA,
Japan, and several others. The goal of course is to provide strong authentication
through documents that strongly identify their bearers and cannot be forged.
Unfortunately, as demonstrated in [9] and throughout Europe [10], e-passports
fall short of their goals as they can be used for clandestine scanning and tracking.
Even if a mechanism called Basic Access Control is used to encrypt tag-to-reader
communications, the cryptography is very weak since the secret key can be brute-
forced very easily (the secret key really provides about 50-bits of security).
3 Security and Privacy
As we have already highlighted, RFID technology poses unique risks to personal
privacy and security. RFID tags come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. While
some tags are easy to spot, others can be very small (the µ-chip by Hitachi [12]
measures 0.4 mm including the antenna) or they can be embedded inside boxes,
clothes, etc. and thus be invisible to the human eye. Since tags can be interrogated
by hidden readers, the data transmitted by the tag may provide identiﬁcation and/or
location information as well as speciﬁcs about the tagged product, such as price,
color, date of purchase, etc.
This threat to privacy is magniﬁed further by the fact that readers can scan multi-
ple tags at the same time. This means that if a person enters an area carrying several
tagged items, it takes just one RFID reader to collect the information emitted by
all the tags! This information can then be used in numerous ways. For one, retail-
ers can use RFID readers to build complete proﬁles and target speciﬁc individuals.
For another, even if tag responses do not make sense because they are encrypted,
a collection of ﬁxed identiﬁers may still help identify the whereabouts of a person
66

by matching these identiﬁers either through some form of payment that reveals the
person’s identity (e.g. credit card) or through a snapshot taken by a hidden camera.
Although our focus here is personal privacy, RFID tags can also pose a threat
to corporate security because many different entities can read the tags [13]. For
example, competitors can remotely gather conﬁdential supply chain data or more
frighteningly deny this information to the company by performing radio frequency
jamming attacks. For a more complete list of threats, the authors in [14] offer a
taxonomy of attacks across the different stages of a typical industrial supply chain.
Finally, several interesting books (other than the current one) have already been pub-
lished: [15], which is dedicated to RFID security and privacy and [16] that focuses
on consumer privacy violations.
Thus incorporating security to RFID technology is not only in the interest of indi-
viduals but companies as well. In the remainder of this section, we will list in more
details the various threat and security requirements we expect from secure RFID
protocols and then present an overview of existing privacy enhancing techniques.
3.1 Security Requirements
Most threats to personal privacy arise from the fact that RFID tags come equipped
with unique identiﬁers that can be read by anyone with a reader. In a typical system
(Fig. 3), a reader makes a scan request and the tag responds with an identiﬁer that
helps identify the object carrying the tag. We list a set of general security goals that
should be true for any RFID protocol as follows:
• Privacy enforcement. No secret information should leak from the tag that can
help in identifying tag contents or the bearer of the tag. Current RFID tags aim
to be cheap [17], so they emit constant identiﬁers that may reveal personal and
sensitive information. Examples include money, medicine (which may link to a
particular disease), books (which may indicate a particular political preference),
and so on.
• Protection against tracking. Since tags can be read from inside wallets, back-
packs, suitcases, etc. and readers can be everywhere (hidden in walls, en-
trances, . . . ) current RFID deployments can be used to track people by the tags

they carry. Additionally, a collection of tagged objects may pinpoint to a partic-
ular person, even if a personal identity is not associated with the tags. To solve
this problem no ﬁxed identiﬁers should be emitted by the tags.
In addition to the above basic requirements, a list of derived requirements
follows:
• Efﬁciency of identiﬁcation. Once a tag response is received by a reader, it is for-
warded to a back-end database that helps identify the tag from a list of valid
tag identiﬁers. Since this database may consist of millions even billions of items
and readers can be used to read multiple tags at the same time, scalability must
be a necessary requirement of any well-designed protocol. We feel that secu-
rity solutions that are not coupled with efﬁcient identiﬁcation eventually will be
dropped out.
• Protection against tag spooﬁng or cloning. A tag cloning attack allows an adver-
sary to either install a replacement tag or simply query the tag and forward its
response to a nearby reader. This would fool the system into believing the prod-
uct is still on the shelf, or alternatively, an expensive item could be purchased
for the price of a cheap one. These person-in-the-middle type of attacks can have
serious consequences especially when RFID tags are used for access control. Ex-
amples of such attacks have been demonstrated in [18], where serious security
weaknesses in SpeedPass and many automobile immobilizer systems have been
identiﬁed, in [19], where a device was built that could clone RFID-based entry
systems made by several vendors, and in [20], where an attacker can trick a reader
into communicating with a victim smartcard that is very far away despite the fact
that contactless smartcards have an alleged range of just a few centimeters. Un-
fortunately, all protocols that have the form of Fig. 3 fall prey to these relay at-
tacks since tag responses cannot be authenticated without further involvement of
the reader. One possible defense is to consider distance-bounding techniques that
are designed so that the round-trip delay time of a challenge–response exchange
is measured accurately and is protected against manipulation [21]. However, the
method of [21] does not quite ﬁt in the RFID paradigm since many messages
have to be exchanged to reduce the probability of error.
• Forward privacy. RFID tags are inexpensive devices that offer no tamper resis-
tance, hence they suffer from physical attacks that attempt to expose their mem-
ory contents, in particular secret values (keys) stored in the tag. An attacker upon
compromising a tag may be able to link this tag with past actions performed on
the tag. Forward privacy ensures that messages transmitted today will still be
secure in the future, even after compromising the tag.
3.2 Policy and Other Nonprotocol Approaches
Some simple solutions to mitigate the privacy problems introduced by the use of
RFID tags include “killing” the tags or alternatively putting them to “sleep.”
68
T. Dimitriou
Killing the tags can be enforced by a password protected kill operation. A reader
at a point of sale may instruct the tag to kill itself by sending a small tag-speciﬁc
pin, thus rendering the tag inoperable. While this measure certainly enforces user
privacy, a killed tag may lose all its postsale beneﬁts for the consumer. For ex-
ample, in a home equipped with this ubiquitous technology, refrigerators, ovens,
washing machines, and other devices could not longer interact with tagged objects
and act on behalf of the consumer based on the exchanged information. People with
Alzheimers disease could not maintain their independence by getting assistance and
guidance in everyday activities [22]. For these reasons and others that require tags
to remain operable through their lifetime (libraries, rental shops, etc.), one should
look for less “devastating” approaches to security.
One such alternative would be to put the tags to “sleep.” A user could disable the
tag at the point of sale and then wake it up again at the convenience of her home.
However, this approach poses certain management problems; if users do not want
anybody with a reader to reactivate their tags, these “wake-up” commands must be
protected by a password known only to the user. But then consumers would lose
all the convenience of using RFIDs and force themselves to live in a nightmare of
passwords.
Another technique that could be used is to prevent the reader for understanding a
tag’s reply by means of blocking. In one instantiation of this scheme, a blocker tag
could be used that would disrupt all communications from selected tags [23]. The
proposed blocker tag could be carried by users inside purses or clothes and selec-
tively control which of the users’ tags might respond to scanning attempts. In some
sense this would be similar to a Faraday cage that shields radio communications, the
only difference being that tags outside the “privacy” zone of the blocker tag could
still respond to scan requests.
We feel, however, that these solutions add a burden to consumers. What if a
person neglects to kill a tag, or carry a blocker tag or forget to implement some
security policy, especially if additional steps are required to make them effective?
(A prototype killer kiosk requires users to load one item at a time, clearly a time-
consuming and inconvenient process [24].) What would happen if users that decide
to disable their tags do not get the same beneﬁts as the rest? Thus killing or blocking
tags might create two types of customers: those that care about privacy and those
who do not (or not having the knowledge or time to do so). Belonging to either class
could have important, negative ramiﬁcations [25].
Finally, it may be helpful to consider policy-based approaches in protecting user
privacy from covert use of RFID technology. CASPIAN (Consumers Against Su-
permarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering), an organization for the defense of in-
dividual liberties, believes that RFID technology and its implementation should be
guided by strong principles of fair information practices (in a similar vein, Simson
Garﬁnkel proposed an “RFID Bill of Rights” in [26]). In general, the following set
of minimum guidelines (adapted from [25]) must be enforced:
• Openness or transparency. Individuals have a right to know about readers and
RFID tagged products as well as their technical speciﬁcations. There should be
no hidden tags and no tag-reading in secret.
tags and readers are used.
