User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Got an email saying my password is weak, reason for concern? I recently received an email from a well-known company stating that the password I use is weak and can be easily guessed.

The email seems legit with no attempt to steal information, they only say "log into your account and go to account->account details to change your password" with no link that they can fake or anything.


How do they know that my password is weak? 
Are they not supposed to not know my password because it is encoded when they save it?
Should I be concerned about the way they handle my information?


The company the email is from is a pretty major and well-known company. I have not used their service or logged in for a few months.

Assistant: They do not need to be able to read your password to test it against known weak and guessable passwords. All they need to do is to try all the guessable passwords against your password. It can be properly hashed and salted, as they are supposed to do.

They can do this quickly because they have legitimate access to the password hashes and can simply have tests running in the background. There are even services out there for companies to use that hold leaked passwords from other known leaked password databases.

Of course, once they test it, then they might know what your password is (depending on how they tested it), but then, so can attackers using the same method.

So, there is no indication of improper password handling. No reason for concern. But, if their automated testing found it, then your password is probably very guessable and should be changed as soon as possible.
