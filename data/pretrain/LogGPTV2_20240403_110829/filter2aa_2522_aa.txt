Who Controls the Past 
Controls the Future
Who Controls the Present 
Controls the Past
Nothing gives rest but the 
sincere search for truth.

# The Internet is life
# Goodbye traditional media
# Unpredictable nature of the Net
# Weaponization of the Net
# Government repression & 
legitimate criminal pursuit
Greetz 101 Palace Strategy
# Rule #1: Never trust the Internet
# Must shrink the info space
#Family-centric calendar (T-stan)
#DDoS the news (K-stan)
# Good reasons for censorship
#Criminal, cultural, religious
#Political adversaries
Greetz 101 Tactics
# Goal #1: the delivery of 
unaltered messages to your 
citizens
#(And denial of the same to 
your rivals)
# The Internet can help
#Surveillance/manipulation
#State-owned telecoms
Cyber S.W.A.T.
# Read, delete, modify data packets
#By IP, domain, strings, etc
# Call law enforcement when 
necessary
# Plausible deniability in 
Cyberspace
# International politics?  Human 
rights?  Buehler?
Which Internet?
# The Eastern Albonian Internet
#Few international sites
#Heavily regulated local sites
# Some gvts open, proud of censorship
#Better than silence
#Secrecy may imply impropriety
Practical Challenges
# Filtering Net traffic is not easy
#Networks are complex, dynamic
#Change control a nightmare
# No network is air-tight
#Sophisticated users
#Hostile network operations
Denial of Sin (DoS)
# Sex words make great keywords
#Pornography easier than politics
# Blacklists should be double-
checked by real people 
#Marinated chicken breasts
#Middlesex County
# How to poison a webserver
Programming & Politics
# Challenge for AI: words in context
#Was that constructive criticism?
#Humour, irony, sarcasm, satire?
# SME required
#History, language, culture
#Impossible in Internet era
#Esp for one-man show: NK, T-stan
The Despot's Challenge
# Over/under-blocking
#Blacklisting
#String matching: “royal family”
and “corrupt”
#Should be 2-stage system
#Whitelisting
#Deny anything not explicitly allowed
The Human Factor
# Influence user behaviour
#Intimidation = self-censorship
# Security personnel
#Traditional skills inadequate
#Recruits need skillz
