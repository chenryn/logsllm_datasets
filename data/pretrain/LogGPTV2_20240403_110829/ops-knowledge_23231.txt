User: I just started setting up a centos server today and noticed that the default version of python on centos is set to 2.6.6. I want to use python 2.7 instead. I googled around and found that 2.6.6 is used by system tools such as YUM so I should not tamper with it. Then I opened up a terminal on my mac and found that I had python 2.6.8 and 2.7.5 and 3.3.3 installed. Sorry for the long story. In short I just want to know how to lookup all the version of python installed on centos so I don't accidentally install it twice.
Assistant: As someone mentioned in a comment, you can use which python if it is supported by CentOS. Another command that could work is whereis python. In the event neither of these work, you can start the Python interpreter, and it will show you the version, or you could look in /usr/bin for the Python files (python, python3 etc).
