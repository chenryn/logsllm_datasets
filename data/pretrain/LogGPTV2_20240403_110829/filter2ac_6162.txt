**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

To enhance security, ensure that containers do not run as the root user by default and avoid granting unnecessary privileges or mounting sensitive components. In Kubernetes environments, it is recommended to implement Pod Security Standards that prohibit pods from running privileged containers. This helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation.
