    import typer
    APP_NAME = "my-super-cli-app"
    def main() -> None:
        """Define the main command line interface."""
        app_dir = typer.get_app_dir(APP_NAME)
        config_path: Path = Path(app_dir) / "config.json"
        if not config_path.is_file():
            print("Config file doesn't exist yet")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        typer.run(main)
    ```
    It will give you a directory for storing configurations appropriate for your CLI
    program for the current user in each operating system.
* New: [Exiting with an error code.](typer.md#exiting-with-an-error-code)
    `typer.Exit()` takes an optional code parameter. By default, code is `0`, meaning
    there was no error.
    You can pass a code with a number other than `0` to tell the terminal that there
    was an error in the execution of the program:
    ```python
    import typer
    def main(username: str):
        if username == "root":
            print("The root user is reserved")
            raise typer.Exit(code=1)
        print(f"New user created: {username}")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        typer.run(main)
    ```

        Ansible, Node, ...
## [Storage](storage.md)
* New: Introduce storage.
    I have a server at home to host some services for my closest ones. The server is
    an [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html) which is
    super awesome in terms of electric consumption, CPU and RAM versus cost. The
    downside is that it has no hard drive to store the services data. It does have
    some USB ports to connect external hard drives though. As the data kept growing
    I started buying bigger drives. While it was affordable I purchased two so as to
    have one to store the backup of the data. The problem came when it became
    unaffordable for me. Then I took the *good idea* to assume that I could only have one
    drive of 16TB with my data. Obviously the inevitable happened. The hard drive
    died and those 10TB of data that were not stored in any backup were lost.
    Luckily enough, it was not unique data like personal photos. The data could
    be regenerated by manual processes at the cost of precious time (I'm still
    suffering this `:(`). But every cloud has a silver lining, this failure gave me
    the energy and motivation to improve my home architecture. To prevent this from
    happening again, the solution needs to be:
    * Robust: If disks die I will have time to replace them before data is lost.
    * Flexible: It needs to expand as the data grows.
    * Not very expensive.
    * Easy to maintain.
    There are two types of solutions to store data:
    * On one host: All disks are attached to a server and the storage capacity is
        shared to other devices by the local network.
    * Distributed: The disks are attached to many servers and they work together to
        provide the storage through the local network.
    A [NAS](nas.md) server represents the first solution, while systems like [Ceph](https://ceph.io/en/) or [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) over [Odroid HC4](https://www.odroid.co.uk/ODROID-HC4) fall into the second.
    Both are robust and flexible but I'm more inclined towards building
    a [NAS](nas.md) because it can hold the amount of data that I need, it's easier
    to maintain and the underlying technology has been more battle proven throughout
    the years.
### [NAS](nas.md)
* New: Introduce NAS.
    [Network-attached storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) or NAS, is a computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to many other devices. Basically a computer where you can attach many hard drives.
    I've done an analysis to choose what solution I'm going to build in
    terms of:
    * Software: Whether to use [TrueNAS](nas.md#truenas),
      [Unraid](nas.md#unraid) or [Debian with ZFS](nas.md#debian-with-zfs).
    * [Disks](nas.md#disks)
    More will come in the next days.
* New: [Analyze RAM to buy.](nas.md#ram)
    Most [ZFS](zfs.md) resources suggest using ECC RAM. The provider gives me two
    options:
    * Kingston Server Premier DDR4 3200MHz 16GB CL22
    * Kingston Server Premier DDR4 2666MHz 16GB CL19
    I'll go with two modules of 3200MHz CL22 because it has a smaller [RAM
    latency](ram.md#speed).
* New: [Analyze motherboard to buy.](nas.md#motherboard)
    After reading these reviews([1](https://reviewsgarage.com/best-motherboards-for-nas/), [2](https://pcper.com/2020/03/asrock-x570m-pro4-micro-atx-motherboard-review/)) I've come to the decision to purchase the [ASRock X570M Pro4](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/X570M%20Pro4/index.asp) because, It
    supports:
    * 8 x SATA3 disks
    * 2 x M.2 disks
    * 4 x DDR4 RAM slots with speeds up to 4200+ and ECC support
    * 1 x AMD AM4 Socket Ryzenâ„¢ 2000, 3000, 4000 G-Series, 5000 and 5000 G-Series
        Desktop Processors
    * Supports NVMe SSD as boot disks
    * Micro ATX Form Factor.
    And it gives me room enough to grow:
    * It supports PCI 4.0 for the M.2 which is said to be capable of perform twice
        the speed compared to previous 3rd generation. the chosen M2 are of 3rd
        generation, so if I need more speed I can change them.
    * I'm only going to use 2 slots of RAM giving me 32GB, but I could grow 32 more
        easily.
* New: [Analyze CPU to buy.](nas.md#cpu)
    After doing some [basic research](cpu.md) I'm between:
    | Property        | Ryzen 7 5800x | Ryzen 5 5600x  | Ryzen 7 5700x | Ryzen 5 5600G  |

    The data was extracted from [AMD's official page](https://www.amd.com/en/products/specifications/compare/processors/10466,11826,10471,11176).
    They all support the chosen RAM and the motherboard.
    I'm ruling out Ryzen 7 5800x because it's too expensive both on monetary and
    power consumption terms. Also ruling out Ryzen 5 5600G because it has
    comparatively bad properties.
    Between Ryzen 5 5600x and Ryzen 7 5700x, after checking these comparisons
    ([1](https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/amd-ryzen-7-5700x-vs-amd-ryzen-5-5600x),
    [2](https://www.amd.com/en/products/specifications/compare/processors/10466,11826,10471,11176))
    it looks like:
    * Single core performance is similar.
    * 7 wins when all cores are involved.
    * 7 is more power efficient.
    * 7 is better rated.
    * 7 is newer (1.5 years).
    * 7 has around 3.52 GB/s (7%) higher theoretical RAM memory bandwidth
    * They have the same cache
    * 7 has 5 degrees less of max temperature
    * They both support ECC
    * 5 has a greater market share
    * 5 is 47$ cheaper
    I think that for 47$ it's work the increase on cores and theoretical RAM memory
    bandwidth.
* New: [Analyze CPU coolers to buy.](nas.md#cpu-cooler)
    It looks that the [Ryzen CPUs don't require a cooler to work well](cpu.md#quick-shopping-tips). Usually it adds another 250W to the consumption. I don't plan to overclock it and I've heard that ZFS doesn't use too much CPU, so I'll start without it and monitor the temperature.
    If I were to take one, I'd go with air cooling with something like the [Dark Rock 4](https://www.bequiet.com/en/cpucooler/1376) but I've also read that Noctua are a good provider.
* New: [Analyze server cases to buy.](nas.md#server-case)
    I'm ruling out the next ones:
    * [Fractal Design
        R6](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-r6/blackout/):
        More expensive than the Node 804 and it doesn't have hot swappable disks.
    * Silverstone Technology SST-CS381: Even though it's gorgeous it's too
        expensive.
    * Silverstone DS380: It only supports Mini-ITX which I don't have.
    The remaining are:
    | Model             | Fractal Node 804         | Silverstone CS380   |
    | ---               | ---                      | ---                 |
    | Form factor       | Micro - ATX              | Mid tower           |
    | Motherboard       | Micro ATX                | Micro ATX           |
    | Drive bays        | 8 x 3.5", 2 x 2.5"       | 8 x 3.5", 2 x 5.25" |
    | Hot-swap          | No                       | yes                 |

    | PSU compatibility | ATX                      | ATX                 |
    | Fans              | Front: 4, Top: 4, Rear 3 | Side: 2, Rear: 1    |
    | Price             | 115                      | 184                 |
    | Size              | 34 x 31 x 39 cm          | 35 x 28 x 21 cm     |
    I like the Fractal Node 804 better and it's cheaper.
* New: Choose the Power Supply Unit and CPU cooler.
    After doing some [basic research](cpu.md#cpu-coolers) I've chosen the [Dark Rock
    4](https://www.bequiet.com/en/cpucooler/1376) but just because the [Enermax
    ETS-T50 AXE Silent
    Edition](https://www.enermaxeu.com/products/cpu-cooling/air-cooling/ets-t50-axe/)
    doesn't fit my case :(.
    Using [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) I've seen that with 4 disks
    it consumes approximately 264W, when I have the 8 disks, it will consume up to
    344W, if I want to increase the ram then it will reach 373W. So in theory I can go with a 400W power supply unit.
    You need to make sure that it has enough wires to connect to all the disks.
    Although that usually is not a problem as there are adapters:

    After an [analysis on the different power supply units](psu.md), I've decided to
    go with [Be Quiet! Straight Power 11 450W Gold](https://www.bequiet.com/en/powersupply/1251)
### [OpenZFS](zfs.md)
* New: [Learning.](zfs.md#learning)
    I've found that learning about ZFS was an interesting, intense and time consuming task. If you want a quick overview check [this video](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=MsY-BafQgj4). If you prefer to read, head to the awesome [Aaron Toponce](https://pthree.org/2012/04/17/install-zfs-on-debian-gnulinux/) articles and read all of them sequentially, each is a jewel. The [docs](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/) on the other hand are not that pleasant to read. For further information check [JRS articles](https://jrs-s.net/category/open-source/zfs/).
* New: [Storage planning.](zfs.md#storage-planning)
    There are many variables that affect the number and type of disks, you first
    need to have an idea of what kind of data you want to store and what use are you
    going to give to that data.
    * [Robustness](zfs.md#robustness)
    * [Preventing concurrent disk failures](zfs.md#preventing-concurrent-disk-failures)
* New: [Choosing the disks to hold data.](zfs.md#choosing-the-disks-to-hold-data)
    Analysis on how to choose the disks taking into account:
    * [Disk speed](zfs.md#data-disk-speed)
    * [Disk load](zfs.md#data-disk-load)
    * [Disk type](zfs.md#data-disk-type)
    * [Disk homogeneity](zfs.md#data-disk-homogeneity)
    * [Disk Warranty](zfs.md#data-disk-warranty)
    * [Disk Brands](zfs.md#data-disk-brand)
    The conclusions are that I'm more interested on the 5400 RPM drives, but of all the NAS disks available to
    purchase only the WD RED of 8TB use it, and they use the SMR technology, so they
    aren't a choice.
    The disk prices offered by my cheapest provider are:
    | Disk                 | Size | Price |
    | ---                  | ---  | ---   |
    | Seagate IronWolf     | 8TB  | 225$  |
    | Seagate IronWolf Pro | 8TB  | 254$  |
    | WD Red Plus          | 8TB  | 265$  |
    | Seagate Exos 7E8     | 8TB  | 277$  |
    | WD Red Pro           | 8TB  | 278$  |
    WD Red Plus has 5,640 RPM which is different than the rest, so it's ruled out.
    Between the IronWolf and IronWolf Pro, they offer 180MB/s and 214MB/s
    respectively. The Seagate Exos 7E8 provides much better performance than the WD
    Red Pro so I'm afraid that WD is out of the question.
    There are three possibilities in order to have two different brands. Imagining
    we want 4 disks:
