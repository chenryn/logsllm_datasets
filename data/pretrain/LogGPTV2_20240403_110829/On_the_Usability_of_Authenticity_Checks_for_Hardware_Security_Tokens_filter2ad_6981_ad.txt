sively private (Y :39%, S:48%) or professional usage (Y :10%,
S:5%). In comparison, 85% of H stated to use their HST only
for private purposes with much lower percentages for private
and professional (11%) or only professional usage (3%).
6.7.2 Trust Factors (Q4/a, Q17)
The upper part of Table 3 shows whether our participants
trusted their devices’ genuineness when receiving them. Most
of H and S stated that they did, whereas Y were more scepti-
cal and often reported a lack of knowledge (χ2(Y H ): p  .19 [small]; χ2(Y S ): p  .22 [medium]). We
assume this difference might be due to recent media reports
on ﬂawed or counterfeit YubiKeys [16, 97].
The lower part of Table 3 describes which factors inﬂu-
enced the participants’ trust in the genuineness of their devices
when they received them. Generally, the majority of all groups
reported a high inﬂuence of the packaging characteristics on
their trust, except for holographic stickers which mostly did
not affect their perception of device genuineness. There were
signiﬁcant differences in trust in the vendors’ name and logo
between H and S (χ2(H S ) : p  .35
[large]). 72% of H , but only 30% of Y and 6% of S stated that

Hardware wallet (H ), YubiKey (Y ), and Smartphone users (S).
– Manual checks and single piece casts are mostly not applicable for S
instructions were provided. From those participants who an-
swered to Q15 with "yes" (a prerequisite for answering Q16),
the majority (H :80%, Y :70%) thinks that they have carried
out all provided checks. Thereby, we observed no signiﬁcant
differences between Y and H (χ2(Y H ) : p > .08,V = .35
[large]). The answers of S to Q15 can be neglected, since
only four participants of S answered that their manufacturer-
provided information on manual authenticity checks and,
hence, reached this question.
Our results show signiﬁcant differences between all groups
in their assessment of whether automatic authenticity checks
are performed by their devices (χ2(Y H ,Y S ,H S ) : p  0.24 [medium]). 76% of H were conﬁdent that au-
tomatic checks are implemented in contrast to 14% of Y and
21% of S. Some stated that they do not know whether any
checks were carried out (H :13%, Y :29%, S:45%), which
indicates a lack of information material as the automatism
might conceal this method’s existence.
6.7.5 Perceived Security (Q6, Q7, Q9, Q11, Q12, Q13)
We asked our participants about their perceived effectiveness
of authenticity checks in relation to attack vectors (Table 4).
Holographic Stickers: Their ineffectiveness, as found in
the market review, was perceived as such by about two-ﬁfths
of HST users. Half of them mistakenly stated that these stick-
ers prevent token replication or hardware/software modiﬁ-
cations. In contrast, S mainly reported prevention against
swapping devices, and only a fourth of them attributed no ef-
fectiveness to the stickers. A higher percentage of S than HST
users reported a lack of knowledge with signiﬁcant differences
between S and H (χ2(H S ) : p < .01,V = .25 [small]).
Interior Inspection: The majority of Y reported a lack of
knowledge on its effects, which we attribute to the single-
piece cast of YubiKeys that prevent interior inspection. This
led to signiﬁcant differences between Y and H for added
hardware (χ2(Y H ) : p < .04,V = .30 [medium]) and notice-
able although not signiﬁcant differences for swapped devices.
In fact, both attacks are made more difﬁcult through interior
inspection. A large fraction of H reported a lack of knowl-
edge or ineffectiveness of the method, which suggests missing
information material. Two H participants reported that they
refrained from opening their token out of fear of damaging it.
Automatic Checks: Large fractions of H and Y indicated
that automatic checks prevent software modiﬁcation, which is
correct (see Table 1). About one-third of S and about half of
Y and H thought that automatic checks prevent token repli-
cation. This is partly true if remote ﬁrmware attestation is
implemented, which can complicate token replication. More-
over, many H and some Y stated that automatic checks would
prevent hardware modiﬁcations or added hardware, which is
incorrect. These results show that the beneﬁts of automatic
checks are not clearly communicated to (HST) users.
Manual Checks: Y and H stated that manual checks
mainly prevent software modiﬁcation, followed by hard-
ware manipulation, token replication, and additional hardware.
For S, not enough participants reported having performed
these checks in order to draw statistically signiﬁcant conclu-
sions. Depending on the manual checks offered, these can
indeed prevent software modiﬁcation (manual ﬁrmware load,
ﬁrmware attestation) or token replication (key attestation).
However, manual authenticity checks cannot protect against
added hardware or IC modiﬁcations. From these results, we
derive that HST users do not have a clear idea of the security
beneﬁts offered by manual checks. This is also emphasized
by the results of Q16a where HST users stated that they did
not know which authenticity checks existed and were not sure
whether these methods are suitable to ensure genuineness.
Although manual and automatic checks can offer equal pro-
tection, our participants trusted the automatic checks more.
This indicates that especially the beneﬁts of manual checks
are not sufﬁciently conveyed to them.
Signature or Hash Check: The majority of all groups cor-
rectly reported that this check prevents software modiﬁca-
tion, with no signiﬁcant differences across groups. Neverthe-
less, many participants (additionally) incorrectly stated that it
would protect against swapped devices, hardware implants or
modiﬁcation. Participants of all groups assessed the beneﬁts
of automatic/manual software checks differently in compari-
son to signature/hash veriﬁcation—although they are actually
similar—and assumed a connection between software checks
and hardware authenticity.
Single-Piece Cast: Although some participants correctly
stated that single-piece casts could prevent (or complicate)
