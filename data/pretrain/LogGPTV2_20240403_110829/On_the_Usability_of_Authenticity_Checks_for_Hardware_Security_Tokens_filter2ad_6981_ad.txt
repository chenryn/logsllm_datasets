### 6.7.1 Usage Patterns (Q1, Q2)
Participants reported using their hardware security tokens (HSTs) primarily for private (Y: 39%, S: 48%) or professional purposes (Y: 10%, S: 5%). In contrast, 85% of hardware wallet (H) users stated they use their HSTs exclusively for private purposes, with much lower percentages for combined private and professional use (11%) or solely professional use (3%).

### 6.7.2 Trust Factors (Q4/a, Q17)
The upper part of Table 3 illustrates the participants' trust in the genuineness of their devices upon receipt. The majority of H and S users expressed confidence in the authenticity of their devices, while Y users were more skeptical and often cited a lack of knowledge (χ²(Y-H): p > .19 [small]; χ²(Y-S): p > .22 [medium]). This discrepancy may be attributed to recent media reports on flawed or counterfeit YubiKeys [16, 97].

The lower part of Table 3 details the factors influencing participants' trust in the genuineness of their devices. Generally, most participants across all groups reported that packaging characteristics significantly influenced their trust, except for holographic stickers, which had little impact. Significant differences were observed in the trust placed in the vendor's name and logo between H and S users (χ²(H-S): p > .35 [large]). Specifically, 72% of H users, but only 30% of Y users and 6% of S users, indicated that the vendor's name and logo strongly influenced their trust.

### 6.7.3 Authenticity Checks (Q15, Q16)
Figure 2 shows the self-reported authenticity checks performed by participants. For H and Y users, the majority (H: 80%, Y: 70%) believed they had carried out all provided checks, with no significant differences between these groups (χ²(Y-H): p > .08, V = .35 [large]). However, only four S users reached this question, as few received manufacturer-provided information on manual authenticity checks.

Significant differences were observed in the assessment of whether automatic authenticity checks are implemented (χ²(Y-H, Y-S, H-S): p < .24 [medium]). 76% of H users were confident that automatic checks are in place, compared to 14% of Y users and 21% of S users. A notable proportion of participants (H: 13%, Y: 29%, S: 45%) were unsure if any checks were conducted, suggesting a lack of informative material.

### 6.7.4 Perceived Security of Authenticity Checks (Q6, Q7, Q9, Q11, Q12, Q13)
Table 4 presents the perceived effectiveness of various authenticity checks in relation to different attack vectors.

**Holographic Stickers:**
- About two-fifths of HST users recognized their ineffectiveness, as found in the market review.
- Half of HST users mistakenly believed these stickers prevent token replication or hardware/software modifications.
- S users mainly reported that stickers prevent device swapping, with only a quarter attributing no effectiveness to the stickers.
- A higher percentage of S users than HST users reported a lack of knowledge, with significant differences between S and H users (χ²(H-S): p < .01, V = .25 [small]).

**Interior Inspection:**
- The majority of Y users lacked knowledge about its effects, likely due to the single-piece cast of YubiKeys, which prevents interior inspection.
- Significant differences were observed between Y and H users for added hardware (χ²(Y-H): p < .04, V = .30 [medium]).
- Interior inspection can make attacks more difficult, but many H users reported a lack of knowledge or perceived it as ineffective, suggesting a need for better informational materials.

**Automatic Checks:**
- Large fractions of H and Y users correctly indicated that automatic checks prevent software modification.
- About one-third of S users and half of Y and H users thought automatic checks prevent token replication, which is partly true if remote firmware attestation is implemented.
- Many H and some Y users incorrectly believed that automatic checks prevent hardware modifications or added hardware.
- These results indicate that the benefits of automatic checks are not clearly communicated to HST users.

**Manual Checks:**
- Y and H users stated that manual checks primarily prevent software modification, followed by hardware manipulation, token replication, and additional hardware.
- For S users, insufficient data was available to draw statistically significant conclusions.
- Manual checks can indeed prevent software modification and token replication, but not added hardware or IC modifications.
- HST users generally do not have a clear understanding of the security benefits of manual checks, as indicated by their responses to Q16a.

**Signature or Hash Check:**
- The majority of all groups correctly reported that this check prevents software modification.
- Many participants, however, incorrectly believed it also protects against swapped devices, hardware implants, or modifications.
- Participants assessed the benefits of automatic/manual software checks differently from signature/hash verification, despite their similar effectiveness.

**Single-Piece Cast:**
- Some participants correctly stated that single-piece casts can prevent or complicate certain attacks.
- However, there was a general lack of understanding regarding the specific benefits of this feature.

### Table 5: Perceived vs. Actual Effectiveness of Attestation
| Attack Vector | Actual Effectiveness (Market Review) | Perceived Effectiveness (Survey) |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Implants      | (cid:35) No prevention               | 0% - 100%                       |
| Replication   | (cid:71)(cid:35) Complicates/Decreases usefulness | 0% - 100% |
| Modification  | (cid:32) Strong protection           | 0% - 100%                       |

This table compares the actual and perceived effectiveness of attestation methods in preventing different types of attacks.
