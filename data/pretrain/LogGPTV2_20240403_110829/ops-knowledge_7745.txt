User: I changed the environment variable PATH, to a new value and then back to what I believe was the original one. But now I can't open a .ipynb file through the Windows command line the was I was used to.
After changing the directory in command line and running 
ipython notebook notebook_name.ipynb
I get the following message: 

'ipython' is not recognized as an internal or external command.

My environment variable is set to a folder with python.exe, and this folder includes a subfolder with ipython.exe and jupyter-notebook.exe. When I open iPython command line and type %env, I can see the full path to the correct subfolder under PATH.
Can someone point to a solution?
Thanks.
Assistant: So I figured out a solution - I changed the environment variable PATH to the subfolder with the .exe files. Although the path including this subfolder was listed under %env, it did not work without being referred directly in the System setting.
