## Expected Behavior
To not hide overflow of body & make things shift when scrollbar disappears.
## Current Behavior
Hides overflow of body.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Have content within `` tag that causes it to overflow or `` has style of `overflow: visible`
  2. Open select drop down
## Context
It messes with styling that relies on body having overflow content. Below is a
sample of what's happening on the demo site. Notice the scroll bar vanishing
as soon as the menu pops up.
