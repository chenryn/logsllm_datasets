A Most Extreme Blocking Rules
Table 4 shows the top ten base censored domains blocked
under Rule 4 that we have discussed in §4.1. The blocking
rule applied on these ten domains results in overblocking
of more than 24K innocuous domains, which is more than
half of all innocuous domains. The third column shows some
samples of innocuous censored domains that GFWatch has
discovered. The impacted innocuous domains presented in
this table are all active and hosting some contents at the time
of writing this paper. Except those that do not allow Web
Archive’s crawler, we have also saved a snapshot of these
domains at https://web.archive.org for future reference
in case these domains become inactive. In contrast, most base
censored domains shown in the second column are not cur-
rently hosting any content. Therefore, one may wonder why
many seemingly inconsequential domains are being censored.
To make sure that these seemingly inconsequential cen-
sored domains were not blocked because the GFW was using
an imprecise classiﬁer (e.g., a Bloom ﬁlter) for fast classi-
ﬁcation, we tested 200M randomly generated nonexistent
domains and found that none were censored. It is worth not-
ing that many censored domains discovered by GFWatch
have been blocked before the launch of our platform. Prior to
our testing, they might have served “unwanted” content that
we were not aware of. Moreover, the GFW is known to con-
duct blanket blocking against websites that run editorials on
“unwanted” topics without carefully verifying their contents.
Once domains are censored, they are often kept in the GFW’s
blocklist for a long time regardless of their activity [75].
As can be seen from the table, the GFW’s overblocking
design affects not only usual ASCII-based innocuous domains,
but also Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), i.e., those
starting with “xn--”. Of 41K innocuously blocked domains,
we ﬁnd a total of 1.2K IDNs are overblocked. Our ﬁnding
shows that the current DNS-based blocking policy of the
GFW has a widespread negative impact on the domain name
ecosystem.

we also follow a common practice that is widely used in re-
search activities that involve network scanning, i.e., allowing
opt-out. More speciﬁcally, we accompany our probing DNS
queries with a non-censored domain under our control, from
which the information about our study and a contact email
address can be found to request opt-out from our measure-
ment. Since the launch of GFWatch, we have not received
any complaints or opt-out requests.
Figure 12 show the cumulative number of forged IPs dis-
covered daily and over the whole period of our measurement.
Similar to Figure 7, the number of forged IPs addresses ob-
served initially in April is also about 200. However, we did
not see any gradual increase in the number of forged IPs from
May as seen in Figure 7. After waiting about two months
without seeing any new IPs observed from probing different
preﬁxes, we have learned that this is due to the fact that we
only use one known censored domain for probing the preﬁxes.
This is because of an earlier precaution that these probed des-
tinations are not owned by us, thus we should try to limit the
amount of probing trafﬁc as much as possible. However, it
turned out that we need to probe more than just one domain to
be able to obtain a similar set of forged IP addresses detected
earlier by GFWatch.
We then decide to add more domains to this test, probing a
total of 22 censored domains per preﬁx. These domains are
selected from several categories, including advocacy organi-
zations, proxy avoidance, news and media, social network,
personal websites and blogs, shopping, instant messaging,
etc. As expected, the cumulative number of forged IPs im-
mediately increases to almost 1K the day we revise our test
domains. Similar to Figure 7, the cumulative number of forger
IPs also increase gradually towards the end of August. With a
major increase of more than 300 forged IPs, the number of all
forged IPs observed from our preﬁxes probing measurement
also converges to above 1.5K by the end of December.
While the number of forged IPs obtained from probing the
preﬁxes on some days, especially from July to September,
is higher than what GFWatch observed during this period,
we ﬁnd that 96% of the forged IPs observed from preﬁxes
probing have already detected by GFWatch. Conducting the
same injection frequency analysis on these forged IPs gives
us the same results as found in §5.2. In other words, the
most frequently injected IPs discovered by GFWatch and
from probing different preﬁxes are the same. To this end, we
could conﬁrm that the coverage of forged IPs discovered by
GFWatch is representative and sufﬁcient for us to develop
effective detection (§6.2) and circumvention strategies (§7).
C Multiple Injectors
It was ﬁrst reported by [21] that the GFW comprises multiple
injectors that are responsible for DNS poisoning. Depend-
ing on the domain being queried (e.g., google.sm), multiple
forged responses can be triggered simultaneously to increase
Figure 12: Number of forged IPv4 addresses detected over
time by probing different network preﬁxes in China.
B Consistency of Forged IP Addresses Across
Different Network Locations
To conﬁrm whether the pool of forged IPs discovered by
GFWatch (§5) is representative enough, we probe different
network locations in China to compare the forged IPs ob-
served from these locations and the ones seen by GFWatch.
For this experiment, we obtain the daily updated pfx2as
dataset provided by CAIDA [28], and extract preﬁxes lo-
cated in China by checking them against the MaxMind
dataset [7], which we also update biweekly. Unlike the mea-
surement conducted between our own controlled machines
located at two sides of the GFW, this task requires us to send
DNS queries, encapsulating censored domains, to destina-
tions we do not own. Although similar large-scale network
probing activities are widely conducted nowadays by both
academia [42, 74, 78, 90] and industry [11, 12], our measure-
ment must be designed in a careful and responsible manner.
Our sole purpose of this measurement is to deliver probing
queries passing through the GFW’s infrastructure at differ-
ent network locations to trigger censorship, instead of having
the probing packets completely delivered to any alive hosts.
Therefore, we craft our probing packets using the routing ad-
dress of a given preﬁx as the destination IP. According to the
best current practice [50], except for the case of a /32 subnet
with only one IP, the routing address of a subnet should not
be assigned to any device because it is solely used for rout-
ing purposes. For example, given the preﬁx 1.92.0.0/20
announced in the pfx2as dataset, we craft our probing packet
with the destination as 1.92.0.0. With this probing strategy,
we can reduce the risk that our packets will hit an alive host
while still being able to deliver them across the GFW’s in-
frastructure at different network locations. To reduce the risk
even further, we opt to only probe preﬁxes whose subnet is
less-speciﬁc than /24.
In spite of the standardized practices in assigning IP and the
extra care that we have taken in designing our measurement,

D Politically Motivated Censorship
Internet censorship and large-scale network outages are often
politically motivated [53, 82]. From the censored domains
discovered by GFWatch, we ﬁnd numerous governmental
websites censored by the GFW, including many sites belong-
ing to the US government, such as share.america.gov,
cecc.gov, and uscirf.gov.
During the nine-month measurement period, GFWatch
has also spotted several blockages that coincide with political
events. For instance, soon after the clash between China and
India due to the border dispute in Ladakh [86], on June 18th
2020 GFWatch detected the DNS ﬁltering of several Indian
news sites (e.g., thewire.in, newsr.in). We reached out to
the editor of the Wire India to report blockage against their
website by the GFW and were told that they were unaware of
the blockage since the site was still accessible from China ear-
lier. Another instance is the blockage of scratch.mit.edu
that took place in August, 2020, due to some content deemed
as anti-China hosted on this website, affecting about three
million Chinese users [77]. Although this event was reported
by the GreatFire project [55] on the 20th and by Chinese users
on the 14th [77], GFWatch actually detected the ﬁrst DNS
poisoning instance earlier on August 13th.
These cases highlight the importance of GFWatch’s ability
to operate in an automated and continuous fashion to obtain
a constantly updated view of the GFW to timely inform the
public about changes in its blocking policy.
E Detailed Comparison with Related Work
Table 5 provides a detailed comparison, highlighting the main
differences between GFWatch and prior studies. Note that
the numbers of IPs in this table indicate IPv4 addresses. We
do not include a comparison of the number of IPv6 addresses
because most previous works did not consider IPv6 in their
experiments.

the chance of successfully poisoning censored clients if one
of the injectors is overloaded, and make detection and circum-
vention non-trivial. From the data collected by GFWatch,
we have conﬁrmed the same injection behavior. More speciﬁ-
cally, there are three injectors, which can be differentiated by
the “DNS Authoritative Answer” ﬂag in the DNS header and
the “do not fragment” ﬂag in the IP header. Injector 1 has the
“DNS Authoritative Answer” bit set to 1, Injector 2 has the
“DNS Authoritative Answer” bit set to 0 and “do not fragment”
bit set to 1, whereas Injector 3 has the “DNS Authoritative
Answer” bit set to 0 and “do not fragment” bit set to 0.
Based on these ﬁngerprints, we then cluster 311K censored
domains into three groups with respect to the three injectors.
Figure 13 depicts the number of censored domains observed
over time for each injector. Injector 2 is responsible for 99%
of the censored domains, whereas Injectors 3 and 1 are re-
sponsible for only 64% and less than 1% (2K) of censored
domains, respectively. Note that all domains censored by In-
jector 3 are also censored by Injector 2, while there are 1.7K
domains censored only by Injector 1, but not other injectors.
