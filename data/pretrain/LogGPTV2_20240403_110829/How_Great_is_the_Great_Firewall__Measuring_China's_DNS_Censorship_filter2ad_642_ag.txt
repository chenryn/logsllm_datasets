### Extreme Blocking Rules

Table 4 illustrates the top ten base censored domains blocked under Rule 4, as discussed in ยง4.1. The application of this rule results in the overblocking of more than 24,000 innocuous domains, which constitutes over half of all such domains. The third column provides examples of innocuous censored domains discovered by GFWatch. These impacted domains were active and hosted content at the time of writing. For those that do not allow Web Archive's crawler, we have saved a snapshot at https://web.archive.org for future reference. In contrast, most base censored domains in the second column are currently inactive, raising questions about the rationale behind censoring seemingly inconsequential domains.

To ensure that these domains were not censored due to an imprecise classifier (e.g., a Bloom filter) used for fast classification, we tested 200 million randomly generated nonexistent domains and found none were censored. Many censored domains discovered by GFWatch had been blocked before our platform's launch and may have previously hosted "unwanted" content. The GFW is known to conduct blanket blocking against websites with "unwanted" editorials without thorough content verification. Once censored, domains often remain on the GFW's blocklist for extended periods, regardless of their current activity [75].

The table also shows that the GFW's overblocking affects both ASCII-based innocuous domains and Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), starting with "xn--". Of the 41,000 innocuously blocked domains, 1,200 are IDNs. This indicates that the current DNS-based blocking policy has a widespread negative impact on the domain name ecosystem.

### Opt-Out Mechanism

We follow a common practice in research involving network scanning by allowing opt-out. Specifically, our probing DNS queries include a non-censored domain under our control, providing information about our study and a contact email address for opting out. Since the launch of GFWatch, we have not received any complaints or opt-out requests.

### Cumulative Number of Forged IPs

Figure 12 displays the cumulative number of forged IP addresses discovered daily and over the entire measurement period. Initially, in April, the number of forged IPs was around 200, but there was no gradual increase from May onwards. After two months, we learned that using only one known censored domain for probing prefixes limited the detection of new IPs. We then increased the number of probed domains to 22 per prefix, selected from various categories including advocacy organizations, proxy avoidance, news and media, social networks, personal websites, shopping, and instant messaging. As expected, the cumulative number of forged IPs immediately increased to nearly 1,000 and gradually rose to over 1,500 by the end of December.

While the number of forged IPs from some days, especially July to September, was higher than what GFWatch observed, 96% of the forged IPs detected from prefix probing were already identified by GFWatch. The most frequently injected IPs discovered by GFWatch and from different prefix probes were the same, confirming the representativeness and sufficiency of GFWatch's coverage for developing effective detection and circumvention strategies.

### Multiple Injectors

It was first reported by [21] that the GFW comprises multiple injectors responsible for DNS poisoning. Depending on the queried domain, multiple forged responses can be triggered simultaneously to increase the likelihood of successful poisoning. From GFWatch data, we confirmed three injectors differentiated by the "DNS Authoritative Answer" flag in the DNS header and the "do not fragment" flag in the IP header. Injector 1 has the "DNS Authoritative Answer" bit set to 1, Injector 2 has it set to 0 and "do not fragment" bit set to 1, and Injector 3 has both bits set to 0.

We clustered 311,000 censored domains into three groups based on these fingerprints. Figure 13 shows the number of censored domains over time for each injector. Injector 2 is responsible for 99% of censored domains, while Injectors 3 and 1 handle 64% and less than 1% (2,000) of censored domains, respectively. All domains censored by Injector 3 are also censored by Injector 2, and 1,700 domains are censored only by Injector 1.

### Politically Motivated Censorship

Internet censorship and large-scale network outages are often politically motivated. GFWatch has identified numerous governmental websites, including US government sites like share.america.gov, cecc.gov, and uscirf.gov, censored by the GFW. During the nine-month measurement period, GFWatch detected several blockages coinciding with political events. For example, after the border dispute between China and India in Ladakh, several Indian news sites (e.g., thewire.in, newsr.in) were censored on June 18, 2020. Another instance was the blockage of scratch.mit.edu in August 2020, affecting about three million Chinese users, due to anti-China content. GFWatch detected the first DNS poisoning on August 13th, earlier than other reports.

These cases underscore the importance of GFWatch's continuous and automated operation to provide timely updates on changes in the GFW's blocking policy.

### Detailed Comparison with Related Work

Table 5 provides a high-level comparison of censored domains and forged IPs detected by different studies/platforms, highlighting the main differences between GFWatch and prior work. The numbers of IPs in the table indicate IPv4 addresses, as most previous works did not consider IPv6.

### Consistency of Forged IP Addresses Across Different Network Locations

To confirm the representativeness of the pool of forged IPs discovered by GFWatch, we probed different network locations in China. We used the daily updated pfx2as dataset from CAIDA and extracted prefixes located in China using the MaxMind dataset. Our probing strategy involved sending DNS queries to routing addresses of given prefixes to minimize the risk of hitting live hosts. Despite standardized practices and careful design, we found that 96% of the forged IPs observed from prefix probing were already detected by GFWatch, confirming its coverage and effectiveness.

### Conclusion

The findings highlight the extensive and often politically motivated nature of internet censorship in China, emphasizing the need for continuous and automated monitoring to keep the public informed about changes in the GFW's policies.
