TrueCrypt6
•  Never thoroughly audited on Windows 
•  Differences reported in volume headers 
•  Small differences in distributed binaries vs. source  
•  Windows vs. Mac & Linux 
•  With exception of deniability volume, no formal 
cryptanalysis 
•  Deterministic build? (Xavier de Carné de 
Carnavalet) 
•  Last license review in 2008 by RedHat/Fedora/OSSI 
concluded “we would not be protected from a 
lawsuit” and “this license is non-free”
