1 Introduction
Inrecentyears,serviceshavegeneratedatremendousinterestanduptakebyresearchersandby
theindustry. RobertMorris,Vice-PresidentofServiceResearchatIBM,presentedakeynoteat
theSRII2011GlobalConferenceclearlystating’thatthefutureismovingtoservices; services
are becoming compulsory and will take over the economy’. Extensive research has been done
on services from a sales, communications and business models perspective (e.g. [ZBG08]), a
softwareandITperspective(e.g. [Erl05,CM12]),andadesignperspective(e.g. [NRJK08]). As

We take the challenge of developing a novel perspective on the global economy by connecting
service models representing open business services (e.g. consulting, e-governmental, SaaS and
educationalservices)typicallyprovisionedbycommercialcompaniesandgovernmentalagencies.
Thedifficultieswhichwefaceindoingsodiffersignificantlyfromthosetackledbypriorworkin
globaldistributedinformationintegrationandlargescalesystems. Comparedtopreviousworkin
Service-OrientedArchitecture(SOA),wetargetthestudyofbusinessserviceswhichgoesbeyond
theanalysisofWebservices(e.g. WSDL,SOAP,andREST)incomplexity. Furthermore,SOA
generally relies on top-down and BPM (Business Process Management) strategies to develop
process models. We take a totally different approach: we follow a self-governing and bottom-
up approach which generates network models by using relationships instead of using temporal
andcontrol-flowconnectors. Wewilladdressthechallengesbyusingexploratorytechniquesfor

2 Motivation
A service network can be defined as a business structure made up of services which are nodes
connected by one or more specific types of relationships. Figure 1 shows the main elements of
service networks and their environment. Services are illustrated by using nodes. Relationships
areillustratedwithedgesandrepresentthetransferofgoods,revenue,knowledge,andintangible
benefits[All00]. Boththerelationshipsandthenodesare“heavy”withresources,complexpro-
cessmodels,interactionsbetweenstakeholders,knowledgeandunderstandinginmanydifferent
forms[HF02].
Let us consider the networked economy by looking into a specific class of service networks:
financialservicenetworks.Today’sfinancialnetworksarehighlyinterrelatedandinterdependent.
Anydisordersthatoccurinoneserviceofthenetworkmaycreateconsequencesinotherservices
ofthenetwork.Forexample,in2008,theeconomicproblemsinitiatedachainreactionthatstarted
in the U.S. and caused problems in European markets and took almost Iceland to bankruptcy.
Leadingfinancialservicesclosed(e.g.LehmanBrothersinvestmentbank),othersmerged,andyet
newserviceswerecreated.Theconfigurationandtopologyoffinancialservicenetworkschanged
as a reaction mechanism. The disaster was a surprise for most people, but local information
to each financial institution and financial service was available and could have been utilized to
anticipatethecatastrophe. Unfortunately,theinformationwasnotaccessibletoregulators.
Nowconsiderthatgovernmentshadthetechnologyandlegalpowertoforcefinancialinstitutions
todescribealltheirfinancialservicesusingmachine-understandablestandarddescriptionmodels
(e.g. *-USDL). Using this approach, all the services and their descriptions would be remotely
accessibletoregulationbodies. Consideralsothatfinancialinstitutionshadtoindicatetowhich
servicesprovidedbyotherinstitutionstheirownservicesestablishedrelationshipswith. Inother
words, if bank A provides loaning or consulting services to bank B, this information is also
describedusingmachine-understandablestandarddescriptionmodelsandisremotelyaccessible
toregulators. Insuchascenario,regulationbodiescouldatanytimeaccessandretrieveservice
and relationship models to (re)construct financial service networks. Afterwards, the querying
and analysis of the network would enable to identify financial network’s vulnerable services to
protectthefunctionalityofthenetwork. Conflictsofinterests,suspiciousrelationships,unlawful
practices,andpatternsindicatingmonopoliesoroligopoliescouldbeidentifiedandtriggerlegal

In a related scenario targeting consumers, financial institutions can use online marketplaces to
advertisetheirfinancialservices. Servicemarketplacesofferapracticalone-stopshoppingplace.
In this case, the development of the concept of OSSN enables consumers to better perceive the
natureoftheservicestheycanacquirebyunderstandinghowtheyinteractandrelatewithother
servicesofthenetworkedeconomy.Anetworkcancontrasttwoserviceswithrespecttopotential
conflictsofinterests,theirtrust,ortheirpositioninthemarket(e.g.competitororcomplementor).
The work presented in this paper describes the current research steps we have already made to
bring these scenarios to life. For example, the family of *-USDL languages we have already
developedtodescribebusinessservicesisexplainedinSection5.1. Wealsodepicttheactivities
which still need to be taken in the following phases of our research project. An example of an
