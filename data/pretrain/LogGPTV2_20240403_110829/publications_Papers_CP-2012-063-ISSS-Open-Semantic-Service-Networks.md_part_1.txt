## Abstract
Online service marketplaces are expected to become a significant part of the economy, enabling the provision of specialized multi-party services through automation and standardization. Current research, such as the *-USDL service description language family, is defining the basic building blocks for the next generation of business services. However, these developments do not focus on interconnecting services via service relationships. Without this concept, marketplaces will remain functional silos containing service descriptions. In real economies, all services are related and interconnected. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of open semantic service networks (OSSNs), which establish rich relationships between services. These networks provide valuable knowledge about the global service economy, which can be exploited for socio-economic and scientific purposes, such as service network analysis, management, and control.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, services have generated significant interest and adoption by both researchers and industry. Robert Morris, Vice President of Service Research at IBM, emphasized in his keynote at the SRII 2011 Global Conference that the future is moving towards services, which are becoming essential and will dominate the economy. Extensive research has been conducted on services from various perspectives, including sales, communications, and business models (e.g., [ZBG08]), software and IT (e.g., [Erl05, CM12]), and design (e.g., [NRJK08]). As observed by Chesbrough and Spohrer [CS06], "the abundance of information about people, technological artifacts, and organizations has never been greater, nor the opportunity to configure them meaningfully into service relationships that create new value." To realize this new form of value co-creation, the authors highlight the enabling role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and service management, design, and engineering.

As a logical next step, current developments are targeting the computer-understandable description of business services using comprehensive languages such as *-USDL (Unified Service Description Language) [CBMK10, BO12]. Three versions of USDL are available, varying in completeness and expressiveness. In the near future, these languages will allow the formalization of business services and service systems, facilitating dynamic service outsourcing, efficient SaaS trading, and automatic service contract negotiation. For example, Linked-USDL builds on Linked Data principles to ensure that service descriptions are published in a way that they can be easily exploited in distributed and heterogeneous environments. Other influential efforts to better understand real-world services include the e3* approaches. E3value [ABG+04] is a set of ontologies and methodologies for analyzing the viability of e-business models. E3service [RZDLGA12] enables the interactive composition of multi-party service networks based on e3value-ontologies.

Current work focuses on the description of services that will be publicized on standalone marketplaces [CR11] and corporate websites. As a result, services will exist in silos, making it impossible to construct computer-understandable network models mirroring global service networks. Complementary, disjoint, equivalent, dependent, related, and similar services will exist on various online marketplaces without being interconnected. For the concept of service networks to be materialized, the notion of open and rich service relationships needs to be explored, and the dynamic (re)creation and analysis of service networks need to be supported by appropriate IT mechanisms. This analysis can be used to reason about a wide spectrum of data, such as transactions, service descriptions, dynamic changes in service offers and demand, and service-service and agent-agent relationships. An equally important area of research is studying the interactions enabled by relationships and how these interactions can be analyzed to measure social trust. This is particularly relevant in service-dominant contexts where services are the result of co-creation between all parties, including providers and consumers. Vargo et al. [VL04] and others have also perceived that we are moving into a service-dominant society. Nonetheless, our knowledge of how global service networks operate is limited and mainly comes from the field of supply chain management.

In this paper, we focus on the challenging task of constructing open semantic service networks (OSSNs) by accessing, retrieving, and combining information from globally distributed service and relationship models. Services, relationships, and service networks are said to be open when their models are transparently available and accessible by external entities and follow an open-world assumption. This represents one of the core principles of the Semantic Web and enables the dynamic addition of new service facts to a knowledge base at any point in time. In logic, this principle states that if a fact is not present in the knowledge base, its truth-value is unknown. Networks are said to be semantic since service and relationship models can be represented using shared models, common vocabularies, and Semantic Web theories and technologies. The ability to construct service networks is the most basic requirement to understand the dynamics of global service-based economies. However, currently available techniques fall short of providing workable solutions as they are unable to deal with the establishment of open and rich relationships between services.

We take the challenge of developing a novel perspective on the global economy by connecting service models representing open business services (e.g., consulting, e-governmental, SaaS, and educational services) typically provided by commercial companies and governmental agencies. The difficulties we face differ significantly from those tackled by prior work in global distributed information integration and large-scale systems. Compared to previous work in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), we target the study of business services, which goes beyond the analysis of Web services (e.g., WSDL, SOAP, and REST) in complexity. Furthermore, SOA generally relies on top-down and Business Process Management (BPM) strategies to develop process models. We take a totally different approach: we follow a self-governing and bottom-up approach that generates network models using relationships instead of temporal and control-flow connectors. We will address the challenges by using exploratory techniques to overcome hidden service information and semantic heterogeneity, including:

1. **Modeling:** One of the first requirements is to be able to model services and relationships articulated by service networks. The model needs to be comprehensive and include all the important concepts that describe the internal and external structure of service systems.
2. **Integration:** To enable a global scale harvesting of knowledge on services, service relationships, and service networks, models need to be open and machine-understandable. The field of the Semantic Web can bring important contributions to address this requirement.
3. **Access and Storage:** The number of service and relationship models potentially available at any given time in the cloud is overwhelming. Only the use of scalable and massively parallel algorithms and platforms can access and create up-to-date data structures that mirror and account for the dynamic nature of global service-networked economies. Network mining, optimization, and reasoning will then come into play.

This paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide a motivation scenario for the importance of constructing global service networks. Section 3 provides a literature review in this emerging field of science. Section 4 outlines the seven design principles to follow when (re)creating OSSNs. Section 5 presents an approach that can both maximize the usage of available service information and enable the location of related services in online marketplaces. Our solution involves four research activities: 1) identification of a suitable schema, language, or ontology to model services, 2) creation of an open and rich model to represent relationships between service models, 3) population of service and relationship models, and 4) development of an infrastructure to query and access distributed service models and dynamically construct global service networks. Section 6 illustrates the value of OSSNs in the context of the FI-WARE project. Section 7 concludes the paper.

### Figure 1: Services, Service Relationships, and Service Networks
- **Service Network:** A business structure made up of services which are nodes connected by one or more specific types of relationships.
- **Services:** Illustrated by nodes.
- **Relationships:** Illustrated with edges, representing the transfer of goods, revenue, knowledge, and intangible benefits [All00].
- **Nodes and Relationships:** Both are "heavy" with resources, complex process models, interactions between stakeholders, and knowledge in many different forms [HF02].

## 2. Motivation
A service network can be defined as a business structure made up of services which are nodes connected by one or more specific types of relationships. Figure 1 shows the main elements of service networks and their environment. Services are illustrated by using nodes, and relationships are illustrated with edges, representing the transfer of goods, revenue, knowledge, and intangible benefits [All00]. Both the relationships and the nodes are "heavy" with resources, complex process models, interactions between stakeholders, and knowledge in many different forms [HF02].

Let us consider the networked economy by looking into a specific class of service networks: financial service networks. Today’s financial networks are highly interrelated and interdependent. Any disorder that occurs in one service of the network may create consequences in other services of the network. For example, in 2008, the economic problems initiated a chain reaction that started in the U.S. and caused problems in European markets, nearly leading Iceland to bankruptcy. Leading financial services closed (e.g., Lehman Brothers investment bank), others merged, and new services were created. The configuration and topology of financial service networks changed as a reaction mechanism. The disaster was a surprise for most people, but local information to each financial institution and financial service was available and could have been utilized to anticipate the catastrophe. Unfortunately, the information was not accessible to regulators.

Now, consider that governments had the technology and legal power to force financial institutions to describe all their financial services using machine-understandable standard description models (e.g., *-USDL). Using this approach, all the services and their descriptions would be remotely accessible to regulatory bodies. Additionally, financial institutions would have to indicate which services provided by other institutions their own services established relationships with. In other words, if Bank A provides loaning or consulting services to Bank B, this information would also be described using machine-understandable standard description models and would be remotely accessible to regulators. In such a scenario, regulatory bodies could at any time access and retrieve service and relationship models to (re)construct financial service networks. Subsequently, querying and analyzing the network would enable the identification of vulnerable services in the financial network, protecting the functionality of the network. Conflicts of interest, suspicious relationships, unlawful practices, and patterns indicating monopolies or oligopolies could be identified and trigger legal investigations to later execute reparative actions if necessary.

In a related scenario targeting consumers, financial institutions can use online marketplaces to advertise their financial services. Service marketplaces offer a practical one-stop shopping place. In this case, the development of the concept of OSSNs enables consumers to better perceive the nature of the services they can acquire by understanding how they interact and relate to other services in the networked economy. A network can contrast two services with respect to potential conflicts of interest, their trust, or their position in the market (e.g., competitor or complementor).

The work presented in this paper describes the current research steps we have already taken to bring these scenarios to life. For example, the family of *-USDL languages we have developed to describe business services is explained in Section 5.1. We also depict the activities that still need to be undertaken in the following phases of our research project. An example of such an activity is populating service and relationship models with instances, which is explained in Section 5.3.

## 3. Literature Review
In the field of services and composing services, research has primarily been conducted from a technical perspective by aggregating software-driven services (see [Erl05]). The goal of this research was not to model service networks as the integration of economic activities but to model the technical interfaces needed for information systems to operate in heterogeneous environments. The research carried out was from a software and IT perspective and can be classified into three categories:

- **Service Descriptions (e.g., WSDL, SAWSDL, OWL-S, and WSMO):** Various ways to describe services’ interfaces using schemas, models, and semantics.
- **Service Architectures (e.g., SOA and SoaML):** Look into the organization of software-based services, how they are connected, and what service information is exchanged between consumers and providers.
- **Process Models (e.g., BPEL, BPMN, WS-CDL, and SOPHIE):** Use choreographies, control-flow elements, events, and temporal dependencies (e.g., S is executed after S) to define the valid sequences for the invocation of services.

Compared to previous work, research on open semantic service networks brings three new main challenging aspects to explore:
1. **Service Descriptions:** Go beyond the simple description of technical interfaces specified with operations and data types (e.g., WSDL). When analyzing services as business activities, legal aspects, pricing models, marketing strategies, and quality levels must be considered.
2. **Service Relationships:** Establish rich and meaningful connections between services, enabling the construction of service networks.
3. **Dynamic and Scalable Infrastructure:** Develop the necessary infrastructure to support the dynamic (re)creation and analysis of service networks, addressing the challenges of scalability and semantic heterogeneity.
