## Abstract
This study examines the impact of a new password policy at a university with 100,000 staff and students. The policy aimed to encourage stronger passwords by varying their lifetime based on their strength, measured using Shannon entropy. Users were informed of the lifetime of their new password, which could range from 100 days (50 bits of entropy) to 350 days (120 bits of entropy). 

We analyzed data from nearly 200,000 password changes and 115,000 password resets over 14 months. The policy took over 100 days to gain traction, but after that, average entropy increased steadily. After 12 months, the average password lifetime rose from 146 days (63 bits) to 170 days (70 bits).

We found that passwords with lifetimes exceeding 300 days are four times more likely to be reset than those with 100-day lifetimes. Users who reset their passwords more than once per year (27% of users) chose passwords with over 10 days fewer lifetime, maintaining this deficit even as they responded to the policy.

We conclude that linking password lifetime to strength at the point of creation is a viable strategy for encouraging users to choose stronger passwords, at least when measured by Shannon entropy.

## 1. Introduction
Password expiration has a long history, dating back to 1979 when it was used to prevent account sharing on early university computers [33]. Initially, this was a management tool rather than a security measure. However, the concept has since been adopted for security purposes, driven by various international government guidelines [9, 12]. Justifications for password expiration include reducing the risk of compromise and limiting the portability of compromised passwords [8, 15, 28].

These justifications have been thoroughly debunked. The security benefits of password expiration are marginal at best [16, 49]. Users often choose new passwords similar to previous ones, and strong passwords combined with background protections can be secure in most scenarios [25, 45]. For online attacks, a password resistant to 10^6 guesses is virtually uncrackable, while for offline attacks, a password must withstand 10^14 guesses.

Current guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, US) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC, UK) recommend that passwords should not expire unless there is evidence of compromise [26, 34].

In this context, we studied a new password policy implemented at our institution. The policy allows users to select any password of at least 8 characters with an estimated Shannon entropy of at least 50 bits. The system rewards stronger passwords with longer lifetimes, ranging from 100 days (50 bits) to 350 days (120 bits).

Our research questions are:
1. What effect does the variable expiration policy have on users' choice of password?
2. Are there identifiable groups of users with different responses to the new policy?
3. What can be discerned about the impact of the policy intervention from system logs?

This study is one of the largest analyses of password data from a single institution, involving over 100,000 users who changed their passwords nearly 200,000 times and reset them 115,000 times over 14 months. Our approach combines routine change and intentional reset events to understand individual users' adoption and use of the new system.

The remainder of the paper reviews related literature (Section 2), introduces our methodology (Section 3), describes and compares our dataset to prior studies (Section 4), analyzes the password change data (Section 4.4), draws on 93 interviews for user feedback (Section 4.7), discusses the impact of the results (Section 5), and concludes with recommendations (Section 6).

### 2.1 Password Strength Estimation
Traditionally, password strength has been measured using Shannon entropy, which calculates the length and character classes of a password [30]. However, these estimates do not accurately represent cracking effort, as passwords are not chosen randomly [13]. This led to the development of strength meters like zxcvbn, which estimate the number of attempts required to guess a password [46]. While zxcvbn is accurate for weak passwords, its error increases for stronger passwords, though it remains a better estimator than Shannon entropy.

### 2.2 The Role of Users in Password Security
Understanding the attacker's modus operandi is crucial in password research. Attack vectors include online and offline attacks. Online attacks can be rate-limited and monitored, but offline attacks bypass these defenses, requiring passwords to withstand 10^14 guesses [22, 23]. In organizations, every password must be strong, as compromising any one account can be sufficient [27].

Many studies have focused on helping users choose stronger passwords through feedback and suggestions [38, 39], memory aids [47], and training [14]. Positive attitudes towards security correlate with stronger passwords [17]. Interventions often require time to show effects, and our study leverages the opportunity to measure behavior over time.

### 2.3 Studying Passwords in the Wild
Most password research has been conducted in lab settings, which lack ecological validity [20, 31]. Studies in live environments, such as leaked password datasets [19, 45] and large-scale analyses [7], provide valuable insights. However, these studies often involve customer accounts, where accessibility is prioritized, and users may not assign high value to their passwords unless personal data or money is at stake.

One comparable study by Mazurek et al. [32] analyzed the plaintext password database of over 25,000 accounts, finding significant correlations between demographic factors and password strength. Another study by Parkin et al. [35] examined a static password expiration policy, revealing usability issues that frustrated users' efforts to create strong passwords.

### 2.4 Password Policy
A comprehensive overview of password policy research is provided by Zhang-Kennedy et al. [50]. Since "Users are not the enemy," there has been a focus on designing policies that consider users' strengths and limitations. Strength aspects like length and composition, and management aspects like frequent changes and non-reuse, have been key areas of focus.
