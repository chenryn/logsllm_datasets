Abstract
We present an opportunistic study of the impact of a
new password policy in a university with 100,000 staff
and students. The goal of the IT staff who conceived
the policy was to encourage stronger passwords by vary-
ing password lifetime according to password strength.
Strength was measured through Shannon entropy (ac-
knowledged to be a poor measure of password strength
by the academic community, but still widely used in
practice). When users change their password, a pass-
word meter informs them of the lifetime of their new
password, which may vary from 100 days (50 bits of en-
tropy) to 350 days (120 bits of entropy).
We analysed data of nearly 200,000 password changes
and 115,000 resets of passwords that were forgot-
ten/expired over a period of 14 months. The new policy
took over 100 days to gain traction, but after that, aver-
age entropy rose steadily. After another 12 months, the
average password lifetime increased from 146 days (63
bits) to 170 days (70 bits).
We also found that passwords with more than 300 days
of lifetime are 4 times as likely to be reset as passwords
of 100 days of lifetime. Users who reset their password
more than once per year (27% of users) choose pass-
words with over 10 days fewer lifetime, and while they
also respond to the policy, maintain this deﬁcit.
We conclude that linking password lifetime to strength
at the point of password creation is a viable strategy for
encouraging users to choose stronger passwords (at least
when measured by Shannon entropy).

Introduction
The expiration of passwords for machine accounts has
had a long history. Tracing back to 1979, expiration was
a tool to stop users sharing accounts on the ﬁrst university
computers [33]. This was not a need borne of security – it
was a management mandate to allow for proper account-
ing of computation time. However the notion has been
appropriated to serve security, spread by various interna-
tional government guidelines that have since prescribed
the expiration of passwords [9, 12]. Various justiﬁcations
for password expiration have been found: the longer a
password is ‘alive’, the higher the chance of compromise
and the need to reset passwords (due to sustained attacks
or inevitable leakage), or, that expiration limits the porta-
bility of a compromised password, as old passwords may
be replicated on other services for convenience [8, 15,
28].
These myths have been thoroughly debunked. The
security beneﬁts of password expiration are marginal at
best [16, 49]. Users regularly choose new passwords that
are very similar to a previous password (through for in-
stance incremental changes to a number in a sequence
of passwords) [48, 49]. Further, passwords of sufﬁcient
strength can be combined with background protections
to be strong enough in most scenarios: a password which
can resist 106 guesses is all but uncrackable in an online
attack scenario [25], if combined with sensible throttling
[25, 45]. To defend against the ofﬂine attacks a password
is required to withstand 1014 guesses.
This body of research has now informed practical ad-
vice, and a change of guidelines. Both the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology (NIST, US, [26]) and
the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC, UK, [34])
now prescribe that passwords should not expire unless
there is evidence of compromise.
A holistic view of password policy management is
required in practice. For example, a user’s choice to
re-use passwords across separate accounts is rational
when there are simply too many passwords to remem-
ber [29]. Users may apply strategies to group accounts
by perceived importance and assign a password to each
group [24].
Against this background of prior knowledge on pass-
word expiration, we were invited to study the new pass-
word policy implemented at our home institution. The
choice of password strength estimation and parameters

were not made by the authors. The new policy allows
users to select any password of character length 8 or
more with an estimated information entropy (Shannon
entropy, a poor measure of cracking resistance, but still
widely deployed) of at least 50 bits (see Section 3.3 for
the policy speciﬁcs). The new system retains the expec-
tation that users will harden their accounts with strong
passwords, but in a twist provides a reward of longer
password lifetime for selecting stronger passwords. A
password with an estimated entropy of 50 bits has a life-
time of 100 days, and every additional bit of entropy in-
creases the lifetime by approximately 3 days, up to 350
days for 120 bits of entropy.
We then use the term password strength here as the
number of days a password lives for before being ex-
pired, as this is a measure of account strength that is vis-
ible to both the users and managers of the system.
The research questions examined in this paper are:
RQ1 What effect does the password policy of variable
expiration have on a user’s choice of password?
RQ2 Are there identiﬁable groups of users with analyt-
ically different responses to the new password rules
and introduction of the new policy?
RQ3 What can be discerned about the impact of a policy
intervention at a large institution from system logs?
We believe that this research constitutes the largest
analysis of password data from a single institution with
over 100,000 enrolled users in the system, who change
their passwords nearly 200,000 times and reset (forgot-
ten or expired) their passwords 115,000 times over a pe-
riod of 14 months. Our approach is novel as we anal-
yse routine change and intentional reset events together,
to understand individual users’ journeys through adop-
tion and continued use of the new system. This approach
leverages the working relationship with the system man-
agers, who allowed continuing access to the anonymised
log data and kept us informed on events outside of the
system which could impact use and hence the logs them-
selves (such as university-wide events).
We begin the remainder of the paper with a review of
the related literature in Section 2. After an introduction
to our methodology in Section 3 we describe and com-
pare the general statistics of our dataset to prior studies
on large password analysis (Section 4). This is followed
by an analysis of the password change data in particu-
lar, answering our research questions in Section 4.4. We
draw on 93 interviews with staff and students for anec-
dotal user feedback in Section 4.7. We then discuss the
impact of the results in Section 5 and close with conclu-
sions and recommendations in Section 6.
2 Related Literature
The related literature is divided into the following sec-
tions: we start with a discussion of password strength es-
timation, then focus on the user’s role in password man-
agement and password studies.
2.1 Password strength estimation
Traditionally, password strength has been measured as
the entropy of a password through a calculation involv-
ing a password’s length and the different number of char-
acter classes it uses [30] (Shannon entropy, which is also
the estimation technique our institution uses, albeit with
a few modiﬁcations as described in Section 3.3). These
estimates are however not representative of the cracking
effort, as passwords are not actually chosen randomly
[13]. This has led to the creation of strength meters in-
spired by password-cracking, which estimate the num-
ber of attempts required for a password to be guessed.
The current state of the art is zxcvbn [46], which al-
gorithmically accurately estimates the strength of weak
(< 104 guesses) passwords with only 234kB of data. For
stronger passwords the strength estimation error of zx-
cvbn increases, but it is still a better estimator of crack-
ing resistance than information entropy. To accurately
estimate the strength of stronger passwords, signiﬁcantly
more storage and processing power is required, however
this is infeasible for real-time feedback [43].
2.2 The role of users in password security
A primary question that is easily ignored when conduct-
ing password research is the attacker’s modus operandi,
and consequent interactions with the state of security de-
fenses. The main attack vectors of interest are online and
ofﬂine attack. An online attacker performs attacks over
a wire, while the ofﬂine attacker has access to the phys-
ical system. While an online attack can be rate limited,
blacklisted, and actively monitored [4, 37, 44], none of
these defenses are possible against an ofﬂine attack. This
implies that the defensive requirements on the password
are very different [22, 23]. For passwords to be resis-
tant to ofﬂine attacks they realistically need to be able
to withstand 1014 guesses. In the context of an organi-
sation it is not sufﬁcient for the mean password strength
to achieve this level: an attacker is often satisﬁed when
compromising any one account with access to an asset
of value, hence every password needs to withstand such
an attack, which is infeasible [27]. When the entire sys-
tem is under attack, the defense should be centered on
the system too, rather than ofﬂoading it to all the users,
for example through Ersatzpasswords [3].

As researchers have identiﬁed the need to raise the
minimum strength of passwords, a large number of stud-
ies have focused on helping and educating the user in
choosing stronger passwords. Users have been subjected
to immediate feedback and suggestions before submit-
ting their password choices [38, 39] with varying degrees
of success. Research has attempted to improve users’
ability to remember passwords, for example by allow-
ing much longer composite passwords [40], memory aids
[47], or training [14]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, positive
attitudes towards security correlate with stronger pass-
words [17]. Such interventions are often measured over a
relatively short timeframe; a wide-reaching intervention
such as a password system overhaul may require time.
We then leverage the opportunity to measure behaviour
through password change events over time (where this
would be impacted by users’ capacity to remember pass-
words and use longer passwords in practice).
2.3 Studying passwords in the wild
A considerable amount of password research has been
conducted in a lab setting. This allows for great inter-
nal validity through the ability to control the environment
and measure speciﬁc properties of users choices and be-
haviours around passwords. However, Fahl et al. found
that only about half of passwords gathered in a lab study
are comparable to users’ real-world passwords [20]. This
problem is not speciﬁc to password studies, a large num-
ber of lab-based studies in security suffer from a lack of
ecological validity. However, studying security percep-
tions in the real-world comes with its own issues [31].
Fortunately there are a number of password studies that
are conducted in live environments.
The ﬁrst scientiﬁc dissemination of password data was
conducted on leaked password datasets [19, 45]. More
recently Bonneau pushed the scientiﬁc principles of con-
ducting password research by legitimately and rigorously
analysing passwords of 70 million Yahoo! users [7]. The
ﬂurry of data breaches at large online services have fu-
elled research by providing extremely large datasets. Yet
in all of these cases the user is often a customer of
the organisation, with two consequences: service pass-
word policies tend to bow to the need for accessibil-
ity, as services that make access difﬁcult don’t have as
many customers [21]. Users may not assign much value
to these accounts, unless their personal data/money is
stored there.
Apart from our research, the only other comparable
study of password behaviour in a work environment
with high value passwords to study is by Mazurek et
al. [32]. Here the entire plaintext password database of
over 25,000 accounts was available to the researchers
(although considerable security precautions were taken
to limit access to the plaintext passwords). The au-
thors discover signiﬁcant correlations between a number
of demographic and behavioural factors and password
strength, and we will be comparing our demographic
ﬁndings to this research primarily.
Related to passwords, Parkin et al. studied a static
password expiration policy of 100 days in a univer-
sity, contrasting the analysis of helpdesk-related system
events over a period of 30 months to ﬁndings from a
small set of 20 interviews with system users [35]. Users
appreciated the need for security and strong passwords,
but their attempts to create strong passwords were frus-
trated by usability issues not directly apparent from sys-
tem events (such as an inability to know in advance what
the system would accept as a valid password).
Zhang et al. studied 31,075 passwords belonging to
7,936 university accounts in order to analyse the depen-
dency between consecutive passwords [49]. We contrast
their main results to our data in Section 4.
2.4 Password policy
A comprehensive overview of the last 30 years of pass-
word policy research is given by Zhang-Kennedy et
al. [50]. Ever since “Users are not the enemy” there has
been a sustained effort to design security policies for the
user, taking into account their strengths and limitations.
Strength aspects such as length and composition, as well
as management aspects such as change-it-often, do-not-
reuse, do-not-write-down and do-not-share-with-anyone
