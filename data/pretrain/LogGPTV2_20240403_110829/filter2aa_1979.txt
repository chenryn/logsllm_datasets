Hacks ; RaspberryPi, etc!
SDR 101 in One Slide!
What ‘is’ Software Defined Radio?!
● Radio front end!
● No dedicated IC back end for decoding radio 
signal!
● Digitize signal and pass it all to the host system!
● In theory, if you can tune it, you can be that type 
of radio!
SDR Captured Data!
● No packets - just raw data!
● Raw radio samples of some bandwidth per 
sample!
● Bandwidth defines amount of spectrum covered 
by samples!
IQ Data!
● SDR data commonly called “IQ”!
● Imaginary and Quotient components of signal!
● Two-part sample consisting of amplitude and 
phase!
● Sampling only amplitude gives a signal at a time - 
but no idea about frequency!
● Fancy trig gets us signal at specific time!
Choose Your Weapon!
● Bit depth of samples (usually 8 or 16 bit) 
determines fidelity, much like 16 bit color!
● Sample width, such as 200KHz or 20MHz, 
defines how much spectrum can be captured at a 
time!
● Frequency range, such as 30MHz to 4GHz, 
defines the range the radio can be tuned to!
Antenna Theory from HAM to SDR!
ANTENNA!:!noun:!

Antenna System!
Antenna System (cont)!
Antenna Systems Must Match Transmitter!
● Prune length!
● Antenna tuner!
● Matching Section!
Polarization!
● Horizontal!
● Vertical!
● Circular!
Calculation crash course!
v = f * λ!
speed = wavelength * frequency!
Antenna Characteristics!
Reciprocity of Antennas!
Antenna Gain!
Antenna Polarization!
Antenna types!
!Omnidirectional!
Semi to Very Directional!
Propagation Characteristics!
The S in the DR!
Your success in receiving is going to depend on 
!your antennas and filters!
Do not transmit with a mismatched antenna 
system!
SDR Tools!
● Multiple tools!
● GQRX, SDR# for browsing spectrum!
● GNU Radio is the grand-daddy of decoding 
platforms!
!
Pick the tool for the right job!
What am I seeing/hearing?!
http://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide!
Tools of the Trade!
GQRX - This is where ya start!
Baudline - Non GPL and quirky (50MB file limit)!
GNURadio - GRADWare and goofy!
!
!
Other tools!
1. dsd (audio input selection problem)!
 - Demodulate P25, Mototurbo!
2. multimon-ng!
 - Demodulates almost ALL THE THINGS!
3. smartnet-scanner!
 - More P25 goodness (uses radioreference)!
Linux Only?!
● For most of the tools, yes.!
● To look around, no.!
● Use the same dongle!
● Opposed to GQRX!
o SDRSharp - plugins!
o HDSDR!
Common problems in SDR labs!
● Antennas!
● Lightning!
● Static!
● Noise!
● Clocks and Drift!
Static!
● The cheaper RTL’s do NOT have static 
protection!
● Wind generates static!
● Rubbing things… generates static!
!
Static protection is a must!!

BFG Noise!

Computer Power Supply not in Accordance with 
Barrier, Feed, and Ground (BFG) Principles!
!
Improper grounding solution!
Clocks!
● The cheaper SDR’s have a lot of noise in 
them!
● Choke them out and isolate noise sources!
● Use a unified PPM if you use more than one 
for IQ!
A bit of fun - Hardware Mods!
Multichannel Receivers!

Hardware Mods!
-As the RTL warms up, you’ll get signal drift!
-Know your offset, National Weather Service!
162.400MHz 162.425MHz 162.450MHz 162.475MHz 162.500MHz 162.525MHz 162.550MHz!

Technical Surveillance and Countermeasures!
● It’s a process, not a tool!
● Use lossy antennas and mismatched systems 
to your advantage!
● Know your radio neighborhood!
● HEATMAPS!!
