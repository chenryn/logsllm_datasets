### Title: The Paramedic's Guide to Surviving Cybersecurity

The cybersecurity field is rife with mental health issues, burnout, substance abuse, and even suicide. In a world where the lines between the digital and physical realms are increasingly blurred, professionals face constant threats and challenges that can deeply affect their psychological well-being. While some work in theoretical domains, many of us deal with real-world incidents, challenges, and dangers every day, constantly seeking better ways to respond while maintaining our sanity.

Though we often draw parallels with the military, a more apt comparison may be to the emergency services, particularly Emergency Medical Services (EMS). EMS is a relatively young profession, with the first paramedics only appearing on the scene in the 1970s. They handle both immediate crises and chronic systemic failures, adapting to evolving research and environments. They also face one of the highest rates of burnout and suicide in the working world.

Rich Mogull brings over 30 years of experience as an EMT and paramedic, along with more than 20 years in information security. He has worked in diverse settings, from inner cities and mountaintops to major national disasters. Over the course of his parallel careers, he has observed striking similarities between the highly technical fields of EMS and cybersecurity, and how the latter seems to be following a similar path of maturation.

In this session, Rich will share insights and lessons learned from decades of emergency response. He will demonstrate how these principles can be applied to your cybersecurity career and daily practice, enhancing your effectiveness and mental resilience. His goal is to help you navigate the challenges of the field and, perhaps, avoid the pitfalls that can lead to burnout and other serious consequences.
