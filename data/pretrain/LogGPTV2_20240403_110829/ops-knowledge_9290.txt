Question: "In the context of mobile application security, why is it challenging to include rootkit-like defensive mechanisms, similar to those found in Windows software, in mobile applications?"
 "A": "The mobile industry does not allow for any defensive mechanisms to be implemented due to privacy concerns."
 "B": "Mobile operating systems are inherently secure and do not require additional defensive mechanisms."
 "C": "Mobile apps are sandboxed and deployed in a manner that makes implementing complex rootkit-like defenses unfeasible."
 "D": "Mobile devices lack the necessary processing power to handle the additional load from rootkit-like defensive mechanisms."
Answer: C
