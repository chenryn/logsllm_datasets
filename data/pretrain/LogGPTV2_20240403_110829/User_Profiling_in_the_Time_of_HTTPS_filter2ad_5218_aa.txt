ABSTRACT
Tracking users within and across websites is the base
for proﬁling their interests, demographic types, and
other information that can be monetised through tar-
geted advertising and big data analytics. The advent
of HTTPS was supposed to make proﬁling harder for
anyone beyond the communicating end-points.
In
this paper we examine to what extent the above is
true. We ﬁrst show that by knowing the domain that
a user visits, either through the Server Name Indica-
tion of the TLS protocol or through DNS, an eaves-
dropper can already derive basic proﬁling informa-
tion, especially for domains whose content is homo-
geneous. For domains carrying a variety of categories
that depend on the particular page that a user visits,
e.g., news portals, e-commerce sites, etc., the basic
proﬁling technique fails. Still, accurate proﬁling re-
mains possible through traﬃc ﬁngerprinting that uses
network traﬃc signatures to infer the exact page that
a user is browsing, even under HTTPS. We demon-
strate that transport-layer ﬁngerprinting remains ro-
bust and scalable despite hurdles such as caching, dy-
namic content for diﬀerent device types etc. Overall
our results indicate that although HTTPS makes pro-
ﬁling more diﬃcult, it does not eradicate it by any
means.

INTRODUCTION
Online user proﬁling is a proﬁtable business exten-
sively carried out by third parties such as search en-
gines, ad networks and network providers. It lever-
ages browsing activities to infer user interests and
intentions. Since HTTP traﬃc has no privacy pro-
visions, any third party can pry on the connections

to a websever and proﬁle users. HTTPS enhances
online user privacy by encrypting the communication
between a browser and a webserver. Major internet
stakeholders are pushing for an HTTPS everywhere
web with the promise of increased security and pri-
vacy and, therefore, of mitigating the problem of user
proﬁling by third parties.
In this paper we assess the extent by which HTTPS
prevents third parties from proﬁling users based on
the websites they visit. We show that the widely used
Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS
protocol leaks user interests to third parties which
eavesdrop on the (encrypted) connection between a
client and an HTTPS webserver. The SNI exten-
sion improves address-space utilization as it allows
to consolidate several HTTPS webservers at a given
IP address. However, SNI also hinders user privacy
as it leaks the domain requested by a user, despite the
HTTPS pledge of a secure and private connection.
The privacy leakage due to SNI is especially se-
vere in websites with homogenous content across its
pages. For example, a connection request to www.
foxsports.com/ tells a lot about the user interests, re-
gardless of the actual page the user is browsing within
that website. For a website with more variety across
its pages, the domain requested by a user may not
tell enough about the interests of that user. For ex-
ample, a connection to www.amazon.com/ may not
tell much about a user. However a connection to
www.amazon.com/books/ would reveal interests in
books and a connection to www.amazon.com/baby/
may indicate an intent to buy baby items. We show
that by using traﬃc ﬁngerprinting techniques, a net-
work eavesdropper can accurately tell the page a user
is browsing within a domain and, therefore, build a
reﬁned user proﬁle.
Users proﬁling despite HTTPS is achievable, given
enough bandwidth to ﬁngerprint the websites under
observation. In case bandwidth is an issue, we also
deﬁne an optimization problem that allows an eaves-
dropper to periodically pick the websites to ﬁnger-
print in order to maximize the number of users that
are accurately proﬁled over time.
373Overall, our ﬁndings show that HTTPS, while be-
ing a formidable tool to strengthen the security of
web applications, cannot protect users against online
proﬁling by third parties.
2. BACKGROUND AND MODEL
User proﬁling.
Proﬁling systems often use a closed-source map-
ping between URLs and interest categories. We fol-
low the approach of previous work [1] and instantiate
the mapping using the Display Planner of Google Ad-
Words [2] – an online tool that given a URL returns
the set of categories assigned by AdWords to that
URL. Categories are arranged in a hierarchy and each
URL has, on average, 10 assigned categories. The
Display Planner also provides the inverse mapping,
i.e., given a category it provides a list of websites
that belong to that category.
HTTPS and Server Name Indication.
HTTPS enhances HTTP with the Transport Layer
Security (TLS) protocol. TLS provides a secure pipe
to a server that is usually authenticated via an X.509
certiﬁcate. The secure pipe is established via a TLS
handshake – a procedure that allows the client and
the server to establish cryptographic keys to encrypt
and authenticate data exchanged through the pipe.
Given the ever increasing awareness on the privacy
issues of HTTP, major web stakeholders are mandat-
ing secure (i.e., HTTPS) connections to serve their
websites [3, 4]. Furthermore the Tor Project and EFF
promote the HTTPS Everywhere extension [5, 6],
that automatically redirects browsers to the HTTPS
version of a website when available. One goal of this
collective eﬀort towards an HTTPS web is to increase
online privacy with respect to network eavesdroppers.
HTTPS ensures that a user is connected to the legit-
imate webserver and that the exchanged information
cannot be eavesdropped by third parties.1
Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension of the
TLS protocol by which a client speciﬁes the hostname
it is attempting to connect in the client_hello mes-
sage (the ﬁrst message of a TLS handshake). The ex-
tension is widely used by modern browsers and allows
a server to serve multiple HTTPS websites, each with
its own X.509 certiﬁcate, from the same IP address.
The SNI is, therefore, sent in cleartext and can be
eavesdropped by any party tapping on the network
between the client and the server.
System Model.
We consider a network eavesdropper that tries to
proﬁle users by tapping on their network connections.
We assume an HTTPS everywhere web where users
connect to any website via HTTPS. The network eaves-
dropper, therefore, does not have access to the clear-
text traﬃc exchanged between the user browser and
the webservers but only sees encrypted ﬂows. How-
ever, we assume the eavesdropper can infer the host-
name requested by the user by looking at the SNI
in the client_hello message.
In case SNI is not
used, client queries to DNS (recall that DNS has no
provisions for conﬁdentiality) or simply a whois on
the destination IP address may reveal the hostname
requested by the user.
We simplify the structure of a website and the user
browsing behaviour as follows. Each website has a
main page and a set of 1-st level pages (i.e., the pages
linked on the main page). We do not consider pages of
the website beyond the ones linked on the main page,
but our results can be easily generalized to account for
more complex website structures. Similar to previous
work [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], we assume a user visits one page
at a time for each domain.2 This could be either
the main page, or any of the 1-st level pages. The
eavesdropper tries to infer the page visited by the
user and assigns to her proﬁle the corresponding set
of categories according to Google AdWords.
3. USER PROFILING BY SNI
Looking at the SNI in the client_hello message,
a basic eavesdropper learns the website a user is brows-
ing and assigns the categories of the main page to the
user proﬁle. If the user were actually browsing a page
diﬀerent from the main one, the proﬁle built by the
basic eavesdropper may not be accurate.
A ﬁrst step towards understanding the accuracy
of user proﬁling in an HTTPS everywhere web con-
sists in assessing the diﬀerence between the categories
of a website main page (e.g., the categories of www.
nbcnews.com/) and the ones of any of its 1-st level
pages (e.g, the categories of www.nbcnews.com/politics/).
In this experiment we have collected the list of top
websites returned by AdWords for each of its 24 ﬁrst
level categories.Within each list, we have selected the
100 most popular websites based on their rank in
Alexa [12]. For each of the resulting 2.4K websites
we have fetched the URL of all the links available on
the main page that remains within the same host. We
did not consider external links like the ones to CDNs.
Each of the collected URLs (totalling to more than
110K URLs) was submitted to the AdWords Display
Planner to obtain its set of categories.
For each of the 24 top level categories of AdWords,
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the Jaccard index
among the categories assigned to the main page of a
website and the categories assigned to its 1-st level

count phishing attacks or ﬂaws in the public key cer-
tiﬁcation system.

are fetched simultaneously using HTTPS, remains an
open problem.

pages. A Jaccard index close to 1 means that simply
assigning the categories of the main page to a user
creates a quite accurate proﬁle, regardless of the ac-
tual page the user is browsing within that website. A
Jaccard index close to 0 means that the same proﬁle
technique may lead to a less accurate user proﬁle.
Figure 1 shows a great variance depending on the
main category of the website. Users visiting Sports,
Real Estate or Games websites could be proﬁled very
accurately only by knowing the website their are con-
nected to. However, when a user visits any page
within a website related to, e.g., Shopping, Comput-
ers & Electronics or News, the user proﬁle built by
assigning her the categories of the main page is likely
to be inaccurate.
4. TRAFFIC FINGERPRINTING
In this section we show how to improve proﬁling ac-
curacy by inferring the exact page a user is browsing
using traﬃc ﬁngerprinting. Traﬃc ﬁngerprinting [7,
8, 9, 10] is an active research area on techniques to
