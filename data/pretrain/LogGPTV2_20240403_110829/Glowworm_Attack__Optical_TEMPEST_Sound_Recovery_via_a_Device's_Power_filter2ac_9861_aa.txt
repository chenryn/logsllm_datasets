Abstract
Two main classes of optical TEMPEST attacks against the con-
fidentiality of information processed/delivered by devices have
been demonstrated in the past two decades; the first class includes
methods for recovering content from monitors, and the second
class includes methods for recovering keystrokes from physical
and virtual keyboards. In this paper, we identify a new class of
optical TEMPEST attacks: recovering sound by analyzing optical
emanations from a device’s power indicator LED. We analyze the
response of the power indicator LED of various devices to sound
and show that there is an optical correlation between the sound that
is played by connected speakers and the intensity of their power
indicator LED due to the facts that: (1) the power indicator LED
of various devices is connected directly to the power line, (2) the
intensity of a device’s power indicator LED is correlative to the
power consumption, and (3) many devices lack a dedicated means
of countering this phenomenon. Based on our findings, we present
the Glowworm attack, an optical TEMPEST attack that can be used
by eavesdroppers to recover sound by analyzing optical measure-
ments obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power
indicator LED of various devices (e.g., speakers, USB hub splitters,
and microcontrollers). We propose an optical-audio transformation
(OAT) to recover sound in which we isolate the speech from optical
measurements obtained by directing an electro-optical sensor at a
device’s power indicator LED Finally, we test the performance of
the Glowworm attack in various experimental setups and show that
an eavesdropper can apply the attack to recover speech from speak-
ers’ power LED indicator with good intelligibility from a distance
of 15 meters and with fair intelligibility from 35 meters.

1 Introduction
Optical TEMPEST attacks [25], which are methods aimed at recov-
ering information from systems through optical side effects, pose a
great risk to privacy. In the past two decades, various studies have
demonstrated novel techniques for recovering/extracting informa-
tion from victim devices using optical sensors by exploiting the
correlation between the optical side effects of the information and
the device that is used to deliver/process the information. In this
context, two main classes of attacks were introduced; the first class
includes methods for recovering content from monitors [16, 18, 42].
The second class includes methods for recovering keystrokes from
physical and virtual keyboards [19, 52, 59, 60, 63, 71, 72]. In these
studies, optical data that was obtained directly from the victim
device’s optical emanations (e.g., [42]) or indirectly from reflections
of the victim device’s optical emanations on nearby objects (e.g.,
[16, 18]) was used to recover the desired information from a victim
device. These studies have contributed to improved understanding
regarding the risks posed by optical TEMPEST attacks.
In this paper, we identify a new class of optical TEMPEST at-
tacks: sound recovery by analyzing optical emanations obtained
from a device’s power indicator LED. We show that the power indi-
cator LED of various devices leaks information regarding the sound
played by connected speakers. This occurs in devices whose power
indicator LED is connected directly to the device’s power line and
lack integrated voltage stabilizers. As a result, the optical response
(intensity) of the power indicator LED of such devices is correlative
to the power consumed by the device. This fact can be exploited to
recover sound from the connected speakers directly, by obtaining
optical measurements via an electro-optical sensor directed at the
speakers’ power indicator LED, or indirectly, by obtaining optical
measurements via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power

(e.g., USB hub, microcontrollers).
Previous studies have discussed the risks a device’s power in-
dicator LED can pose to the information delivered/processed by
the device due to the linear response of the power indicator LED
[39, 49]. This fact was exploited in some studies to establish covert
channels by using a preinstalled malware that modulated the data
via a device’s power indicator LED [33–35], however no prior work
was able to demonstrate end-to-end sound recovery from a commer-
cial device’s power indicator LED without the use of malware. Other
studies [24, 53, 54, 62] presented optical methods for recovering
sound by turning nearby objects into diaphragms (e.g., a hanging
light bulb [54], bag of chips [24], trash can [62], glass window [53]).
In these studies, sound was recovered by obtaining optical measure-
ments from vibrating objects (objects vibrate when sound waves
hit their surface). However, each of these methods [24, 53, 54, 62]
suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (1) they are
limited in range (the nearby vibrating object must be within five
centimeters of the sound source [24, 54]), (2) their application can
be detected by an optical sensor (because they require the eaves-
dropper to direct a laser beam into the victim’s room [62]), (3) they
require the eavesdropper to compromise a device with malware
(to stop the LiDAR from turning so it can target a specific point
or to exifltrate the collected data via the Internet [62]). In addition,
all of the methods target the optical changes resulting from mi-
nuscule vibrations of nearby objects that were affected by sound
hitting their surface. We consider these methods to be optical side-
channel attacks rather than optical TEMPEST attacks, because they
do not target the optical correlation between the information and
the device used to deliver/process the information. A recent paper
presented a state-of-the-art sound recovery method [23] using an
EMR (electromagnetic radiation) TEMPEST attack against devices
that contain an MSOC (mixed-signal system-on-chip) with an inte-
grated switching regulator from a distance of 15 meters, however,
to the best of our knowledge, no study has proposed a method
capable of recovering sound from a device at distances greater than
15 meters using a TEMPEST attack.
In this paper, we present the Glowworm attack, an optical TEM-
PEST attack aimed at recovering sound played by commercial speak-
ers. First, we analyze speakers and show that the intensity of their
power indicator LED is affected by played audio. Then, we analyze
various devices (USB hub splitter, micro-controller) used to supply
power for the speakers and show that the intensity of the devices’
power indicator LED is also affected by audio played by the speak-
ers. Then, we suggest an optical-audio transformation (OAT) to
isolate the sound from the optical signal obtained via an electro-
optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the devices.
Finally, we examine the performance of the Glowworm attack in
various experimental setups. We show that it can be used by an
eavesdropper to recover speech from virtual meetings by obtaining
optical measurements directly from the power LED indicator of
speakers with good intelligibility from a distance of 15 meters and
with fair intelligibility from 35 meters.
In this paper, we make the following contributions: (1) We reveal
a new class of optical TEMPEST attack that violates the confiden-
tiality of the information processed/delivered by devices; the attack
should be addressed by hardware manufacturers and considered by
consumers. (2) We show that optical TEMPEST attack can recover
sound from a device at greater distances (35 meters) than an exist-
ing SOTA method that used an EMR (Electro-Magnetic Radiation)
TEMPEST attack (whose range was limited to 15 meters) [23]. (3)
We propose a new method for recovering speech that is external
(obtains data without compromising a device in the target room),
passive (does not rely on an active sensor), and does not depend on
the distance between a sound source and a nearby object.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2,
we review related work. In Section 3, we present the threat model.
In Section 4, we analyze the response of a device’s power indicator
LED to sound played by speakers. In Section 5, we present an
optical audio transformation (OAT) for recovering sound, and in
Section 6, we evaluate Glowworm’s performance on the task of
recovering sound. In Section 7, we discuss potential improvements
that can be made to optimize the quality of the sound recovered by
an eavesdropper. In Section 8, we suggest countermeasure methods
that can be applied to prevent the proposed Glowworm attack. In
Section 9, we present the responsible disclosure we made. In Section
10, we discuss the limitations of the attack and mention future work
directions.
2 Related Work
In this section, we review related work in the area of optical data
leakage and sound eavesdropping. TEMPEST attacks have attracted
the interest of many researchers since Van Eck’s paper was pub-
lished in the mid-1980s [67]. The last three and a half decades have
seen the development of various methods for extracting information
from devices by exploiting the correlation between the informa-
tion delivered/processed by a device and its: EMR emanations (e.g.,
[12, 22, 23, 26, 30, 47, 58]), acoustic emanations (e.g., [14, 17, 20, 28,
29, 36, 64, 74]), vibrations (e.g., [13, 15, 46, 51, 69, 73]), and power
consumption (e.g., [40, 41, 50]). In the past two decades, two main
classes of optical TEMPEST attacks were introduced; the first class
includes methods for recovering content from monitors [16, 18, 42],
and the second class includes methods for recovering keystrokes
from physical and virtual keyboards [19, 52, 59, 60, 63, 71, 72]. In
these studies, optical data that was obtained directly from the victim
device’s optical emanations (e.g., [42]) or indirectly from reflections
of the victim device’s optical emanations on nearby objects (e.g.,
[16, 18]) was used to recover the desired information from a victim
device.
The risks posed by a device’s power indicator LED were discussed
by [39, 49]. However, prior research demonstrating methods capable
of exploiting a device’s power indicator LED for data exifltration
relied on preinstalled malware to establish optical covert channels
[33–35]. The proposed methods leak data from devices that are
connected to air-gapped networks by using preinstalled malware
that modulated data optically via the integrated LED of a device
(e.g., a keyboard [33], router [34], hard drive [35]).
Recent studies have investigated sound eavesdropping [13, 15,
32, 43, 51, 61, 73], suggesting various methods for recovering sound
by analyzing the side effects of sound waves that caused nearby
lightweight objects (e.g., a bag of chips, a window) and devices
(e.g., motion sensors) to vibrate (turning such objects/devices to
diaphragms). In this context, malware was used to recover sound by:

(1) obtaining data from a device’s motion sensors [13, 15, 51, 73], (2)
reprogramming a computer’s audio port from output to input [32],
(3) inverting the process of a vibration motor [61], and (4) analyzing
magnetic data obtained from a hard disk head [43]. These methods
pose a serious threat to privacy, but they require the eavesdropper to
compromise a device (with malware) located near the victim (sound
source) in order to obtain data and exfiltrate it to the eavesdropper.
Optical methods for sound recovery were introduced by [24, 53,
54, 62]. A recent study demonstrated a method capable of classi-
fying words from a precollected dictionary, by analyzing the vi-
brations of a trash can using optical data obtained via a robotic
vacuum cleaner’s LiDAR. This method requires the eavesdropper
to compromise the robotic vacuum cleaner in order to: (1) prevent
the LiDAR from turning and fix the LiDAR on a specific object to
increase the amount of data collected from the vibrating object
(because the frequency of a robotic vacuum cleaner’s 360◦ LiDAR
is limited to 7 Hz), and (2) exfiltrate the data from the robotic vac-
uum cleaner. Three studies [24, 53, 54] presented external optical
methods to recover sound that rely on data obtained via optical
sensors, without the use of malware. The laser microphone [53, 53]
is a well-known method that recovers sound using an external laser
transceiver in which a laser beam is directed through a window
into a target room; the laser beam is reflected off an object and re-
turned to the transceiver which then converts the beam to an audio
signal. The visual microphone [24] recovers sound by analyzing
the vibrations of material inside the victim’s room (e.g., a bag of
chips, water) using video obtained from a high-speed video camera
(2200 FPS) to recover speech. Lamphone [54] recovers sound using
a remote electro-optical sensor by exploiting the vibrations of a
hanging light bulb; the vibrations cause optical changes due to the
non-uniform intensity of lighting, which varies at each angle. These
methods [24, 53, 54] pose a great privacy threat, however from an
eavesdropper’s perspective, they are limited in one of the following
ways: they rely on (1) a very high sound level (over 100 dB) which
is beyond the sound level of speech and meetings (e.g., [24, 54]), (2)
active sensors that use a laser beam (e.g., [53]), a fact that increases
the likelihood of detection (compared to passive sensors), (3) hang-
ing light bulbs, which are not commonly used in office settings
