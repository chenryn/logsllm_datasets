## Abstract
Over the past two decades, two main classes of optical TEMPEST attacks have been demonstrated: methods for recovering content from monitors and methods for recovering keystrokes from physical and virtual keyboards. In this paper, we introduce a new class of optical TEMPEST attacks: sound recovery by analyzing the optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED. We analyze the response of the power indicator LED to sound and demonstrate that there is an optical correlation between the sound played by connected speakers and the intensity of the power indicator LED. This correlation is due to the following factors: (1) the power indicator LED is directly connected to the power line, (2) the LED's intensity is correlated with the device's power consumption, and (3) many devices lack dedicated means to counter this phenomenon.

Based on our findings, we present the Glowworm attack, an optical TEMPEST attack that allows eavesdroppers to recover sound by analyzing optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of various devices (e.g., speakers, USB hub splitters, and microcontrollers). We propose an optical-audio transformation (OAT) to isolate speech from these optical measurements. Our experimental results show that the Glowworm attack can recover speech with good intelligibility from 15 meters and fair intelligibility from 35 meters.

## 1. Introduction
Optical TEMPEST attacks, which exploit optical side effects to recover information from systems, pose significant risks to privacy. Over the past two decades, various studies have demonstrated novel techniques for extracting information from victim devices using optical sensors. These studies have identified two main classes of attacks: (1) methods for recovering content from monitors and (2) methods for recovering keystrokes from physical and virtual keyboards. These studies have contributed to a better understanding of the risks posed by optical TEMPEST attacks.

In this paper, we identify a new class of optical TEMPEST attacks: sound recovery by analyzing the optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED. We show that the power indicator LED of various devices leaks information about the sound played by connected speakers. This occurs in devices where the power indicator LED is directly connected to the power line and lacks integrated voltage stabilizers. As a result, the LED's optical response (intensity) is correlated with the device's power consumption. This fact can be exploited to recover sound from the connected speakers directly or indirectly, by obtaining optical measurements via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED.

Previous studies have discussed the risks posed by a device's power indicator LED, but no prior work has demonstrated end-to-end sound recovery from a commercial device's power indicator LED without the use of malware. Other studies have presented optical methods for recovering sound by turning nearby objects into diaphragms, but these methods suffer from limitations such as limited range, detectability, and the need for malware. Our method, the Glowworm attack, overcomes these limitations by being external, passive, and not dependent on the distance between the sound source and a nearby object.

## 2. Related Work
In this section, we review related work in the area of optical data leakage and sound eavesdropping. TEMPEST attacks have been a subject of interest since Van Eck’s paper was published in the mid-1980s. Various methods have been developed to extract information from devices by exploiting the correlation between the information processed/delivered by a device and its EMR, acoustic, vibration, and power consumption emanations.

Two main classes of optical TEMPEST attacks have been introduced: (1) methods for recovering content from monitors and (2) methods for recovering keystrokes from physical and virtual keyboards. The risks posed by a device's power indicator LED have been discussed, but prior research demonstrating methods capable of exploiting it for data exfiltration relied on preinstalled malware.

Recent studies have investigated sound eavesdropping, suggesting various methods for recovering sound by analyzing the side effects of sound waves on nearby lightweight objects and devices. These methods, while posing a serious threat to privacy, require the eavesdropper to compromise a device with malware.

Optical methods for sound recovery have also been introduced, such as the laser microphone, visual microphone, and Lamphone. These methods, while effective, are limited by high sound levels, active sensors, and the need for specific objects like hanging light bulbs.

## 3. Threat Model
The Glowworm attack involves the following steps:
1. The sound \( s(t) \) of a virtual meeting is played by connected speakers.
2. The power consumption of the power indicator LED of a connected peripheral (e.g., the speakers themselves, a USB hub splitter) changes in response to the sound.
3. The eavesdropper directs an electro-optical sensor at the power indicator LED using a telescope.
4. The optical signal \( opt(t) \) is sampled from the electro-optical sensor via an ADC.
5. The sampled optical signal is processed using an algorithm to recover the acoustic signal \( s^*(t) \).

## 4. Analysis of Power Indicator LED Response to Sound
We analyze the response of the power indicator LED to sound and show that the intensity of the LED is affected by the audio played by the connected speakers. We also analyze various devices used to supply power for the speakers and show that their power indicator LED intensity is similarly affected by the audio.

## 5. Optical-Audio Transformation (OAT)
We propose an optical-audio transformation (OAT) to isolate the sound from the optical signal obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the devices.

## 6. Performance Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the Glowworm attack in various experimental setups. Our results show that the attack can be used by an eavesdropper to recover speech with good intelligibility from 15 meters and fair intelligibility from 35 meters.

## 7. Potential Improvements
We discuss potential improvements that can be made to optimize the quality of the sound recovered by an eavesdropper.

## 8. Countermeasure Methods
We suggest countermeasure methods that can be applied to prevent the proposed Glowworm attack.

## 9. Responsible Disclosure
We present the responsible disclosure we made regarding the Glowworm attack.

## 10. Limitations and Future Work
We discuss the limitations of the attack and mention future work directions.

## Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce the Glowworm attack, a new class of optical TEMPEST attack that recovers sound by analyzing the optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED. Our contributions include revealing a new class of attack, demonstrating the ability to recover sound at greater distances than existing methods, and proposing a new, external, and passive method for sound recovery.
