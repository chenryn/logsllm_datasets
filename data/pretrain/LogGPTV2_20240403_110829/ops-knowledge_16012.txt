User: Please explain what is load balancing, its purpose and application scenarios. And provide at least two common load balancing algorithms.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technical means to allocate network or computing resources to multiple servers, so that the workload of each server is kept within a relatively small range, so as to improve system performance and scalability. and reliability purposes. It is mainly used in systems with high requirements for high availability, high performance and flexibility, so as to satisfy users' fast and efficient access to system resources. Common load balancing algorithms include: 1. Round robin algorithm: assign requests to each server in turn to achieve load balancing. 2. Minimum connection algorithm: allocate the request to the most idle server, that is, the server with the least current connection number, so as to avoid the degradation of service quality caused by the high connection number of a certain server.
