User: So I have recently installed Python Version 2.7.5 and I have made a little loop thing with it but the problem is, when I go to cmd and type python testloop.py I get the error: 

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command

I have tried setting the path but no avail.
Here is my path:

C:\Program Files\Python27

As you can see, this is where my Python is installed. I don't know what else to do. Can someone help?
Assistant: If you want to see python version then you should use py -V instead of python -V

C:\Users\ghasan>py -V
Python 3.7.1

If you want to go to python's running environment then you should use py instead of python

C:\Users\ghasan>py
Python 3.7.1 (v3.7.1:260ec2c36a, Oct 20 2018, 14:57:15) [MSC v.1915 64
  bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Here you can run the python program as:

print('Hello Python')
Hello Python
