**ATT&CK ID:** T1491.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Internal Defacement

An adversary may deface internal organizational systems in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thereby undermining the integrity and trust in those systems. This can be achieved through various means, such as modifying internal websites or directly altering user systems by replacing desktop wallpapers. The adversary might use disturbing or offensive images to cause discomfort among users or to pressure them into complying with accompanying messages. 

Internal defacement typically occurs after other intrusion objectives have been met, as it exposes the adversary's presence within the network.
