User: I have a working wsgi app developed in python. I know that pyinstaller will compile and get me a binary of this application. I have a nginx and uwsgi running. can i use this binary instead of the python script to run the whole thing from uwsgi to boost the speed ..
Assistant: The binary you get is just your program and a python interperter stuffed together into an executable with all dependencies so that it can be easier distributed. It won't give you any speed boost, and it's not really 'compiled' into a binary.
By using a binary of this kind you would loose all the advantages that WSGI provides you, so it's a bad idea. Just deplay your wsgi application as documented.
