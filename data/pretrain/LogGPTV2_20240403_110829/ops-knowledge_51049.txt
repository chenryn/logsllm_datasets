User: How to realize container interconnection in Kubernetes cluster?
Assistant: Container interconnection in a Kubernetes cluster can be achieved in the following ways: 1. Use the localhost address inside the Pod for communication. Containers in the same Pod can communicate via localhost. 2. Use DNS service for communication. Kubernetes provides a built-in DNS service, which enables cross-Pod container communication through service names and port numbers. 3. Use Service to communicate. The Service in Kubernetes can create a load balancer in multiple Pods and forward requests to the containers in the corresponding Pods. 4. Use Ingress to communicate. Ingress is an API object in Kubernetes, which defines rules for external access to multiple Services in the cluster. Through Ingress, multiple Services can be exposed to external networks, and routed and forwarded through Ingress. In general, Kubernetes provides multiple ways to realize container interconnection, and you can choose an appropriate way to configure according to actual needs.
