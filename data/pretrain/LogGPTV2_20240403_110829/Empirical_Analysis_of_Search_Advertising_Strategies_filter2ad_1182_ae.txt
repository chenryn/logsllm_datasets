can be overestimated. They highlight this by studying the impact
of display ads on user activity. They show that presence of display
ads is not necessarily correlated with subsequent user activity. A
key reason is that display ads are expected to perform by their mere
presence in the absence of explicit expression of intent by the user.
In case of web search, however, advertiser pays the search engine
only when there is an ad click and user intent is captured through
the query made by the user. So, a subsequent conversion can be
attributed to a click performed by the user on search engine results
— sponsored or organic.
Absolute metrics. Advertising effectiveness has traditionally
been measured in absolute terms, e.g., click through rates [14, 22,
37, 40] or conversion rates [11, 36]. Other work focuses on preva-
lence [9] or effectiveness of different advertising strategies like mo-
bile advertising [18, 39] or the interaction between ads and organic
search results [10, 44]. Since different metrics focus on different di-
mensions of the campaign, comparing them is not straightforward.
NAB is also an absolute metric, however it explicitly addresses the
multi-dimensional comparison problem by converting other dimen-
sions (i.e., cost) into the primary dimension (conversion probabil-
ity) through a conversion factor (λ) that explicitly tracks the adver-
tiser’s relative utility across dimensions.
Incremental metrics. The Incremental Ad Clicks metric [13]
and the related one for mobiles [32] take a novel approach by
proposing a way to compare two trafﬁc slices. We were inspired
by IAC but ultimately identiﬁed the severe limitations in the gen-
eral approach relating to:
i) ignoring conversions, ii) being ill-
conditioned to noise; and iii) not scaling to the orders of magni-
tude difference in advertiser scale. NAB and INAB are designed to
address these challenges. We were also inspired by work in cost-
effectiveness analysis in the health sector [43].
Other use cases. Our work complements the large body of work
in the space of ad optimizations. Researchers have described a
methodology for A/B testing in context of controlled experiments
online for fairer comparisons [19]. INAB complements this work
by providing a metric that enables direct comparison of the relative
effectiveness of the two tests. [8] develops strategies that adver-
tisers may use to modify bid amounts. Incorporating NAB in the
bidding strategy may allow for joint optimizations in cost and con-
versions. A large body of work has looked at identifying fraud in
online ads [15, 16, 17, 23, 28, 33, 34, 35, 42]. NAB of various sus-
picious trafﬁc slices may be used as an additional signal in these
techniques.
10. FUTURE WORK
In this section we discuss areas where the NAB metric can be
reﬁned and outline future work.
Multiple types of conversions.
In this paper we treat all the
conversion events of an advertiser equivalently. If an advertiser has
multiple types of conversions she is interested in, she would need
to compute the NAB for each type of conversion, and those NABs
would not be mutually comparable. One approach would be to al-
low the advertiser to specify the relative value of each conversion
and extend NAB to allow different types of conversions to be traded
off against one another to arrive at the net NAB across all conver-
sion types.
Probabilistic NAB and brand advertising. As deﬁned NAB
can be applied most readily to search ads since every impression,
click and conversion can be tracked precisely and with certainty. In
traditional brand advertising, simply estimating impression counts
is a hard problem (e.g., TV viewers going to the restroom during
commercial breaks), let alone tracking conversions. It may, how-
ever, be possible to arrive at probabilistic estimates of impressions,
and conversions. One approach could be to extend NAB to in-
corporate probabilistic inputs and output the expected NAB with
conﬁdence intervals.
What-if analysis. In our design of NAB we consider only point-
in-time values and do not leverage the longitudinal perspective our
historical data provides. While one could compute NAB at different
points in the past to extrapolate into the future, a better approach
may be to directly incorporate time-series data as input and output
a time-parameterized NAB function.
11. CONCLUSION
In this paper we develop the net acquisition beneﬁt (NAB) met-
ric to approximate proﬁt per impression in order to measure the ef-
fectiveness of an ad campaign, and the incremental net acquisition
beneﬁt (INAB) to measure the marginal beneﬁt of one ad strategy
over another. Using these metrics and extensive search and ad click
data from a major search-ad provider, we ﬁnd that cannibalizing
organic trafﬁc and poaching a competitor’s trafﬁc are frequently
ineffective while call extensions on mobile phones show promise.
