### The Overestimation of Display Ad Impact on User Activity

The impact of display ads on user activity can often be overestimated. This is demonstrated by research that shows the presence of display ads does not necessarily correlate with subsequent user activity. A key reason for this is that display ads are expected to perform based on their mere presence, without any explicit expression of intent from the user. In contrast, in web search, advertisers pay only when a user clicks on an ad, and user intent is captured through the query. Therefore, a subsequent conversion can be attributed to the user's click on the search engine results, whether sponsored or organic.

### Traditional Metrics for Advertising Effectiveness

Advertising effectiveness has traditionally been measured using absolute metrics such as click-through rates (CTR) [14, 22, 37, 40] and conversion rates [11, 36]. Other studies focus on the prevalence [9] or the effectiveness of different advertising strategies, such as mobile advertising [18, 39] or the interaction between ads and organic search results [10, 44]. Comparing these metrics is challenging because they focus on different dimensions of the campaign.

Net Acquisition Benefit (NAB) is also an absolute metric but addresses the multi-dimensional comparison problem by converting other dimensions (e.g., cost) into the primary dimension (conversion probability) through a conversion factor (λ). This factor explicitly tracks the advertiser’s relative utility across different dimensions.

### Incremental Metrics

The Incremental Ad Clicks (IAC) metric [13] and its related metric for mobiles [32] take a novel approach by comparing two traffic slices. While IAC is innovative, it has several limitations:
- It ignores conversions.
- It is sensitive to noise.
- It does not scale well with differences in advertiser scale.

NAB and INAB (Incremental Net Acquisition Benefit) are designed to address these challenges. We were also inspired by work in cost-effectiveness analysis in the health sector [43].

### Complementary Use Cases

Our work complements existing research in ad optimization. For example, researchers have described methodologies for A/B testing in controlled online experiments for fairer comparisons [19]. INAB complements this work by providing a metric that enables direct comparison of the relative effectiveness of two tests. Additionally, [8] develops strategies for advertisers to modify bid amounts. Incorporating NAB into bidding strategies may allow for joint optimizations in cost and conversions. A significant body of work has focused on identifying fraud in online ads [15, 16, 17, 23, 28, 33, 34, 35, 42]. NAB of various suspicious traffic slices could serve as an additional signal in these techniques.

### Future Work

In this section, we discuss areas where the NAB metric can be refined and outline future work.

#### Multiple Types of Conversions
In this paper, we treat all conversion events equivalently. If an advertiser has multiple types of conversions, they would need to compute the NAB for each type, and those NABs would not be directly comparable. One approach would be to allow the advertiser to specify the relative value of each conversion and extend NAB to trade off different types of conversions to arrive at a net NAB across all conversion types.

#### Probabilistic NAB and Brand Advertising
As defined, NAB is most readily applied to search ads, where every impression, click, and conversion can be tracked precisely. In traditional brand advertising, estimating impression counts and tracking conversions is more challenging (e.g., TV viewers going to the restroom during commercial breaks). However, it may be possible to arrive at probabilistic estimates of impressions and conversions. One approach could be to extend NAB to incorporate probabilistic inputs and output the expected NAB with confidence intervals.

#### What-if Analysis
In our design of NAB, we consider only point-in-time values and do not leverage the longitudinal perspective provided by historical data. While one could compute NAB at different points in the past to extrapolate into the future, a better approach might be to directly incorporate time-series data as input and output a time-parameterized NAB function.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we develop the Net Acquisition Benefit (NAB) metric to approximate profit per impression and measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign. We also introduce the Incremental Net Acquisition Benefit (INAB) to measure the marginal benefit of one ad strategy over another. Using these metrics and extensive search and ad click data from a major search-ad provider, we find that cannibalizing organic traffic and poaching a competitor’s traffic are frequently ineffective, while call extensions on mobile phones show promise.
