that are able to detect malicious domains through the use of
passive DNS monitoring and machine learning [18], [19], [24].
Ultimately, these systems allow network operators to assemble
DNS blacklists of malicious and suspicious domains in order
to detect and prevent malicious activity on the network.
This has led researchers to study the usefulness of such
blacklists. Metcalf et al [46] performed a comparison of 86
different
internet blacklists—of both varying category and
type—over a span of 30 months. Unfortunately, the inventory
of blacklists appears to be partially anonymized, and some
blacklists were collected for as little as three months. There-
fore, it is difﬁcult to compare these results directly with the
blacklists used in this work. The major ﬁndings from their
work showed that there is little overlap between lists for fully
qualiﬁed domain names or IP addresses and, when there is
overlap, no lists consistently outperforms another. K¨uhrer et
al. evaluated the effectiveness of 19 malware blacklists [39]
collected over 2 years by classifying the entries (i.e.,non-
existent, parked, or sinkholed), measuring the completeness,
and testing the reaction time of each blacklist. When compared
against a dataset of 300K samples, they show that the union
of all blacklists contains 70% of domains detected per family.
Furthermore, 58% of domains were seen in their passive DNS
an average of 334 days before appearing on a blacklist. Our
study shows similar results over a much longer observation
period and with almost 100 times more malware.
Finally, Rajab et al. proposed a content-agnostic malware
protection system based on binary and IP/DNS reputation to
address the shortcomings of both blacklists and whitelists [63],
and other works have been proposed that leverage network
related reputation data for malware detection [34], [62].
X. CONCLUSION
After carefully ﬁltering 26.8 million network traces ob-
tained from dynamic malware execution, we are able to make
several observations about the characteristics and temporal
network properties of malware domains. First, we show that
dynamic analysis traces should be carefully curated because
they often contain a great deal of noise. To help with this
challenge, we detail a rigorous methodology that analysts
can use to remove potential noise from such traces. Next,
potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) are not only on the rise,
but surprisingly, they utilize seemingly stable IP infrastructure.
In fact, we show that several hundred thousands PUP samples
use the same network infrastructure over an entire year. Finally,
our analysis shows that malware appears to add marginal
detection beneﬁts when trying to build early warning systems

based on its network communication. We discovered that
302,953 malware domains were active at least two weeks—in
some cases many months—before the corresponding malware
samples were dynamically analyzed. This means that malware
domain blacklists have limited detection value as malware
tends to rapidly churn through domain names—yielding a very
high rate of domain-level polymorphism.
