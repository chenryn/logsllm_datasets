### Description
To prevent the enumeration of administrator accounts during User Account Control (UAC) elevation, it is recommended to disable this functionality. This can help mitigate the risk of account name disclosure, which could be exploited by malicious actors.

### Implementation
The relevant registry key is located at:
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\CredUI\EnumerateAdministrators
```

This setting can be disabled via Group Policy Object (GPO) by following these steps:

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Credential User Interface**.
3. Locate and configure the policy: **"Enumerate administrator accounts on elevation"**.
4. Set the policy to **Disabled**.

By disabling this setting, you can enhance the security of your system by preventing the enumeration of administrator accounts during UAC elevation.
