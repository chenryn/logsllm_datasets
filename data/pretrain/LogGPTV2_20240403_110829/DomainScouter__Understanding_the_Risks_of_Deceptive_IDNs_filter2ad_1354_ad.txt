After demographic questions, the participants were ﬁrst
asked which services they used more than once a month. The
list of the seven popular brands mentioned above was used
to formulate this question. After a few dummy questions, we
then gave the participant a deceptive question, asking “Have
you ever visited [SERVICE].com?” as a closed-ended ques-
tion, which could be answered with “yes” or “no.” Note that
[SERVICE].com was actually replaced by a deceptive IDN in
this question. For example, êxample[.]test would be used
instead of example[.]test. The displayed deceptive IDNs

H: High Score, L: Low Score
and their order were randomized for each participant. We de-
ﬁned potential victims of the attack as those who answered
“yes” in the deceptive questions about a certain brand’s service
among those who used the service more than once a month in
the previous question. We assumed that the participants who
answered “no” recognized the deceptive IDNs.
The median time to complete the survey was 4.3 minutes,
and we compensated the participants $0.75 each. After remov-
ing 17 participants who gave incomplete or careless answers,
we analyzed the remaining 474 participants. The participants’
ages ranged from 18 to 72, with a median of 34 (mean 35.7).
59.7% of the participants were male. Similar to the ﬁrst sur-
vey, the sample of the second survey had a wide range of
education levels and occupations.
A limitation of this user study is that we did not measure the
actual success rate of the attacks. As an ethical consideration,
we did not provide the hyperlinks of the actual deceptive
IDNs in the questionnaires to avoid harming the participants.
Another limitation is that the study was limited to 70 deceptive
IDNs. However, we believe this study can provide unique and
adequate results to show the risks of deceptive IDNs.
Results. We deﬁned the insensible rate = v/p, where p is the
number of participants who answered that they used a certain
brand’s service once a month, and v is the number of potential
victims who answered that they visited the deceptive IDN dis-
guising the brand’s service. The results are shown in Table 10.
Most participants did not really notice the deceptive IDNs
with high scores; the insensible rate for the IDNs with high
scores was 0.92 (=1,153 / 1,242). Surprisingly, many partici-
pants did not notice deceptive IDNs even if their scores were
not high; the insensible rate for the IDNs with low scores was
0.79 (=994 / 1,253) in total. The insensible rate of all IDNs
was 0.86 (= (1,153+994) / (1,242+1,253)). Some participants
who noticed deceptive IDNs commented: “[...] I marked these
as no because they contained these special characters” and
“[...] questions are supposed to be phishing or intentionally
fake sites but I marked no on the ones that aren’t plainly the

real domain.” Unfortunately, the participants who were IT
professionals and computer engineers were also likely not to
notice deceptive IDNs, similar to other participants.
Overall, as shown in Table 11, we found a positive corre-
lation between the deceptive IDN score and the insensible
rate of the attacks (γ=0.68, p-value<0.0001), although the
correlation was not signiﬁcant for YouTube and Instagram.
This result indicates that the proposed system can success-
fully measure the reasonable scores that reﬂect the tendency
of users to be deceived by deceptive IDN attacks.
In summary, our user study newly revealed deceptive IDNs
are difﬁcult for end users to recognize even if they are IT-
professionals or computer engineers. Through correlation
analysis, we conﬁrmed that the deceptive IDN score success-
fully reﬂects the tendency of users to be deceived by the
considered type of cyber attacks.
7 Discussion
In the previous section, the user studies revealed that most end
users do not notice deceptive IDNs. To mitigate the risks of
deceptive IDNs and enhance cultural and linguistic diversity
on the Internet with IDNs, various stakeholders should take
countermeasures against deceptive IDNs. We believe that our
ﬁndings based on the measurements and user studies can help
improve countermeasures for stakeholders. Now, we brieﬂy
provide discussions and suggestions for client applications,
domain registrars/registries, domain owners, and certiﬁcate
authorities (CA) on how to reduce the spread of deceptive
IDNs.
7.1 Client Application
Client applications such as web browsers and other applica-
tions displaying URLs or domain names can prevent users
accessing deceptive IDNs by detecting them. For example, to
mitigate eng-homo deceptive IDNs, many web browsers have
original policies/rules about whether to display IDNs in Uni-
code or Punycode format in their address bars [18, 45]. More-
over, very recently, the Google Chrome browser has imple-
mented a new experimental feature for warning against looka-
like URLs including eng-homo deceptive IDNs [51]. DO-
MAINSCOUTER found many newly deﬁned deceptive IDNs
other than simple eng-homo, thus, DOMAINSCOUTER can
help improve the rules/functions for providing better detection
coverage of deceptive IDNs.
Unfortunately, the mitigation in client applications can only
prevent users from accessing deceptive IDNs and does not
address the root cause that such deceptive IDNs exist. The
existence of a deceptive IDN similar to a legitimate brand is a
risk of brand defamation, especially for companies. Therefore,
not only client applications but also the other stakeholders
should take other countermeasures against them.
7.2 Registrar and Registry
The guidelines for implementing IDNs [17] for mainly
TLD registries describe that visually confusing characters
from different scripts must not be allowed to co-exist in a
single IDN label unless a corresponding IDN policy and
IDN Table [12, 47] are deﬁned to minimize confusion be-
tween domain names. The majority of eng-combo and eng-
homocombo exhibit the prohibited pattern, mixing cross-
script code points in a single label. According to Table 4, eng-
combo and eng-homocombo account for 49% (=(368+3,697)
/ 8,284) of all 8,284 detected deceptive IDNs. If registries
strictly followed the guidelines prohibiting the mixture of
cross-script code points, approximately half of the discovered
deceptive IDNs could have been avoided.
Registrars and registries make an effort to enable rightsh-
olders to protect their rights when registering domain names;
however, they do not investigate IDNs comprehensively. Al-
though the trademark clearinghouse (TMCH) [57] contributes
to protecting domains, deceptive IDNs are beyond its techni-
cal scope. The TMCH serves as a database for veriﬁed trade-
mark rights information. Trademarks are submitted to the
TMCH by rightsholders. Veriﬁed marks are provided with a
priority-registration period and the Trademark Claims service
for all new gTLDs. The Trademark Claims service identi-
ﬁes potentially abusive registrations by comparing TMCH-
recorded trademark strings to domain names and sends a
notice to rightsholders. The technical problem is a domain
name is considered as an exact match to a TMCH-recorded
string. This method results in false negatives when detecting
deceptive IDNs. Our system discovered various deceptive
IDNs unexplored by other methodologies. This means that
registrars and the TMCH should broaden the scope of the
detection to include IDNs and adopt the method proposed
in this paper to prioritize defending high-scoring deceptive
IDNs. Furthermore, the TMCH should serve not only new
gTLDs but also legacy ccTLDs and new IDN ccTLDs.
7.3 Domain Owner
Brand protection is an essential way for rightsholders to ﬁght
against the violation of their rights. The mindset of those
owning famous domain names (or trademarks) should be to
make an effort to protect their brands and not to allow visu-
ally confusing domain names to be operated by other parties.
The owners of famous domains (or trademarks) can take pre-
ventive actions to protect their brands. They can proactively
422          22nd International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and DefensesUSENIX Associationregister additional domain names that are similar to their own
brands to prevent abusive registrations by other parties. They
can also use brand protection services (e.g., the TMCH) or
take measures by themselves. According to our measurement
results, only 3.8% of the visually confusing domain names
that we discovered as deceptive IDNs were legitimately reg-
istered for brand protection. We assume that most domain
owners (and also brand protection services) are not aware
of such IDNs because they were unexplored by other exist-
ing methodologies; thus, domain owners should broaden the
scope of brand protection to include IDNs.
When domain owners ﬁnd squatted domain names (e.g.,
deceptive IDNs) targeting their brands, they can use the Uni-
form Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) [59]
to conﬁscate or cancel such domain names. The UDRP, a pol-
icy for resolving disputes regarding the registration of domain
names, has been adopted by all ICANN-accredited registrars
of gTLDs [26]. Many registrars of ccTLDs also adopt the
UDRP or regionally localized policies based on it (e.g., JP-
DRP [27]). Dispute resolution services based on the UDRP
are widely used by rightsholders. The World Intellectual Prop-
