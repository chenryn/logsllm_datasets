User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: I had this issue and the other fixes on this page didn't fully solve the problem.
What did solve the problem was going in to my system environment variables and looking at the PATH - I had uninstalled Python 3 but the old path to the Python 3 folder was still there.  I'm running only Python 2 on my PC and used Python 2 to install pip.
Deleting the references to the nonexistent Python 3 folders from PATH in addition to upgrading to the latest version of pip fixed the issue.
