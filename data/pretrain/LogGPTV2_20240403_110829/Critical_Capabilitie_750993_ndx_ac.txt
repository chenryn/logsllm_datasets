### Critical Capabilities Methodology

This methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of products or services. Each capability is then weighted based on its relative importance for specific use cases. Products/services are rated on how well they achieve each critical capability. A score summarizing how well the critical capabilities are met for each use case is calculated for each product/service.

**Critical Capabilities** are attributes that differentiate products/services in terms of quality and performance. Gartner recommends considering these as key criteria for acquisition decisions.

1. **Define the Product/Service Category**: Identify the leading uses and end-user needs in the market. Use cases should match common client deployment scenarios.
2. **Identify Critical Capabilities**: These are generalized groups of features commonly required by the product/service class. Each capability is assigned a level of importance based on the use case.
3. **Evaluate Vendor Products/Services**: Rate each vendor's product or service on a five-point scale for each capability. These ratings allow easy comparisons between different sets of features.

**Ratings Scale**:
- 1 = Poor or Absent: Most or all defined requirements for a capability are not achieved.
- 2 = Fair: Some requirements are not achieved.
- 3 = Good: Meets requirements.
- 4 = Excellent: Meets or exceeds some requirements.
- 5 = Outstanding: Significantly exceeds requirements.

**Overall Score Calculation**: Multiply the product ratings by the weightings to determine the overall score for each product in the use cases.

**Note**: The selected critical capabilities do not represent all possible capabilities and may not be the most important for a specific use situation or business objective. Clients should use this analysis as one of several inputs before making a decision.
