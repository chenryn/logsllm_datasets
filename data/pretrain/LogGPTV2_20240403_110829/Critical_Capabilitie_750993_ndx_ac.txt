■	Analysis of business KPIs and user journeys (for example, login to check-out).
■	The ability to perform interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (that is,traces, metrics, logs) to detect “unknown unknowns”; that is, the ability to identify
underlying issues to unexpected events.
■	Application security functionality, delivered via a common agent or framework for
APM.

Table 1: Weighting for Critical Capabilities in Use Cases(Enlarged table in Appendix)
This methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of products/services. Each capability is then weighted in terms of its relative importance for specific product/service use cases.
Critical Capabilities RatingCritical Capabilities Rating
Each of the products/services has been evaluated on the critical capabilities on a scale of 1 to 5. A score of 1 equals Poor (most or all defined requirements are not achieved), while 5 equals Outstanding (significantly exceeds requirements). However, readers are 
cautioned not to compare scores of the 2021 APM critical capabilities ratings with those in the prior version (see ), because the evaluation process has been updated.In the prior evaluation, Gartner developed persona-based scenario elements against which vendors were asked to demonstrate their product and/or service capabilities. Thus, if the score in the current research is either higher or lower than in the prior version, you should not conclude that the vendor’s offering in some way performed better or worse than last year.

Table 2: Product/Service Rating on Critical Capabilities 
(Enlarged table in Appendix)
Table 3 shows the product/service scores for each use case. The scores, which are generated by multiplying the use-case weightings by the product/service ratings, summarize how well the critical capabilities are met for each use case.Gartner, Inc. | G00750993 Page 28 of 31

Table 3: Product Score in Use Cases 
(Enlarged table in Appendix)
To determine an overall score for each product/service in the use cases, multiply the ratings in Table 2 by the weightings shown in Table 1.
Critical Capabilities MethodologyThis methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of products or services. Each capability is then weighted in terms of its relative importance for specific product or service use cases. Next, products/services are rated in terms of how well they achieve each of the critical capabilities. A score that summarizes how well they meet the critical capabilities for each use case is then calculated for each product/service."Critical capabilities" are attributes that differentiate products/services in a class in terms of their quality and performance. Gartner recommends that users consider the set of critical capabilities as some of the most important criteria for acquisition decisions.

This research note is restricted to the personal use of PI:EMAIL defining the product/service category for evaluation, the analyst first identifies the leading uses for the products/services in this market. What needs are end-users looking to fulfill, when considering products/services in this market? Use cases should match common client deployment scenarios. These distinct client scenarios define the Use Cases.The analyst then identifies the critical capabilities. These capabilities are generalized groups of features commonly required by this class of products/services. Each capability is assigned a level of importance in fulfilling that particular need; some sets of features are more important than others, depending on the use case being evaluated.Each vendor’s product or service is evaluated in terms of how well it delivers each capability, on a five-point scale. These ratings are displayed side-by-side for all vendors, allowing easy comparisons between the different sets of features.
Ratings and summary scores range from 1.0 to 5.0:
1 = Poor or Absent: most or all defined requirements for a capability are not achieved2 = Fair: some requirements are not achieved
3 = Good: meets requirements
4 = Excellent: meets or exceeds some requirements
5 = Outstanding: significantly exceeds requirements
To determine an overall score for each product in the use cases, the product ratings are multiplied by the weightings to come up with the product score in use cases.The critical capabilities Gartner has selected do not represent all capabilities for any product; therefore, may not represent those most important for a specific use situation or business objective. Clients should use a critical capabilities analysis as one of several sources of input about a product before making a product/service decision.
