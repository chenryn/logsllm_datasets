Don’t Fuck It Up!

Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey 
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, 
and obey them until we have succeeded, or 
shall we transgress them at once?
—Henry David Thoreau, Civil Disobedience

its usage statistics.
As a proof of concept we used this approach to control
one of the six hidden service directories of the discovered
Tor botnet, the Silk Road hidden service, and the Duck-
DuckGo hidden service. We tracked these for several days
and obtained the following measurements: (1) The number
of requests for the hidden service descriptor per day (see
Tables I and II) and (2) the rate of requests over the course
of a day, which is shown in Figure 4 (each point corresponds
to the number of hidden service descriptor requests per one
hour).

APPENDIX
A. The Inﬂuence of Shadow Relays on the Flag Assignment
During the second harvesting experiment we accidentally
revealed an important artifact of the ﬂag assignment in Tor
which is not obvious from the Tor speciﬁcations. Near the
end of the experiment we were notiﬁed by the Tor developers
that the Sybil attack had caused a spike in the number of
relays assigned Fast ﬂags and Guard ﬂags (see Fig. 6)
Figure 6.
Increase in the number of Guard nodes.

• 
@yahoo.com has a number of Yahoo groups in his/her 
contact list, some with many hundreds or thousands of 
members 
• 
At DS-200B in particular, collection spiked as: 
–  The initial spam messages were sent (and collected) 
–  Inboxes of email recipients were viewed by 
 contact list 
–  Messages were sometimes viewed, but more often sent as precached 
views on Google and Yahoo (along with inboxes) 
–  Inboxes where the recipient did not delete the spam message continued to 
be collected every time they were viewed  
–  Some recipients added 
@yahoo.com to their address books 
(possibly as a spam defeat?) – address books were collected every time
