### Electron Version
13.1.2
### What operating system are you using?
Windows
### Operating System Version

### What arch are you using?
x64
### Last Known Working Electron version
_No response_
### Expected Behavior
Calling webContents.print() with the absolute minimal set of options and an
existing device as returned from contents.getPrinters() should add the
document to be printed to the printer's print queue and subsequently trigger
the printing of said document.
    const options = {
      silent: true,
      deviceName: 'My-Printer',
    }
    await win.webContents.print(options);
### Actual Behavior
The call to win.webContents.print just silently returns, indicating success,
yet no document is ever added to the printer's print queue and no document is
ever printed.
### Testcase Gist URL
_No response_
### Additional Information
The printer in question is working fine with every other application, so it is
definitely not a printer or driver or operating system issue.
