Product of Activities of the Model TNT
The following subsections present the research context and an overview of the two
families of experiments which were conducted to empirically validate the relationship
between the proposed measures and usability and maintainability of BPMN models.
4.1 Research Context
The objective of carrying out families of experiments to empirically validate the
measures presented in [3] was to discover which of the measures defined could
provide useful and objective information about the external quality of business
process models. They focused mainly on two characteristics of the ISO 9126 external
quality: Usability (understandability) and Maintainability (modifiability). The results
obtained in the empirical validation of the first family are presented in [5].
Initially, the measures were theoretically validated according to the Briand et al.
theoretical framework [16]. As a result, it was possible to group them in relation to
the different properties of structural complexity (size, coupling and complexity) they
evaluate (Fig. 2).

For the empirical validation of the measures defined, a set of experiments was
planned and designed. Using the GQM template (Goal Question Metric) [17], the
research objectives were defined as analyse measures of the structural complexity
BPM's, with the purpose of evaluating them as regards their capability of being used
as indicators of understandability and modifiability of BPMs, in the context of PhD
students, research assistants and others.
The hypotheses proposed with respect to the objective of investigation were to
ascertain if there is a significant correlation between the measurements of structural
complexity and the understandability and modifiability subcharacteristics. The
independent variables were the measures defined for BPMN models and the
dependent variables were those relating to the understandability and modifiability of
BPMs. These latter were measured according to answer times, number of correct
answers, subjective evaluation and the efficiency in the accomplishment of the tasks.
4.2 First Family
The first family of experiments was composed of five experiments. The experimental
design used was the same for all five experiments. They were thus therefore carried
out in similar circumstances and in the same context, that is to say, applying the same
research objective, hypotheses and variables. In the experimental design a within-
subjects design was carried out, in which all the subjects had to do all the tests.
Material composed of ten randomly ordered BPMN models was handed out to each
subject. These BPMN models had different structural characteristics; that is to say,
different degrees of complexity; they included two questionnaires formulated for each
process models. The first one was related to the understandability, and the second to
the modifiability. A subjective question about the complexity of the model was also
included. A more detailed description of the material can be found in [4].
The subjects (Table 3) were chosen as suited our purposes due to all of them had
enough knowledge about modelling to carry out the experimental tasks. To leverage
their knowledge about process modelling a training lesson was carried out before the
experiments run. This session consisted of an introduction to business processes and
training about the BPMN standard notation.

4.3 Second Family
The second family of experiments included the development of five experiments. In
the experiments of the second family, the understandability and modifiability aspects
were also analyzed the difference being that in this instance separate experiments
were designed to analyze each aspect. In this way, of the five experiments included in
the second family, the first three were carried out to analyze the understandability of
the models and in both last experiments the modifiability was evaluated.
The experimental material to analyze the understandability consisted of fifteen
BPMN models with different structural characteristics and degrees of complexity. For
each model a questionnaire with three questions related to the understandability of the
process model was elaborated. In order to analyze the modifiability, the experimental
material consisted of twelve BPMN models and a questionnaire with two
requirements of modifications for each model. Moreover, for all cases the subjects
answered a subjective question regarding the complexity of the process model [5].
As with the first family, the participant subjects in the second family (Table 4)
received a training session about BPMN.

In the context of this paper, now we have described the families of experiments,
the following step is to present the descriptive and statistical analysis that was carried
out to validate the CFC metric. This was done by taking the data obtained concerning
the dependent variables, to determine the feasibility of using the CFC metric to
measure the structural complexity of business process models developed with BPMN.
As both the CFC metric and the measures proposed in [3] evaluate the structural
complexity of BPMs, the same experimental design, hypothesis and variables in the
two families of experiments can be stated. Consequently, the data obtained in the two
former empirical studies can be used to analyze whether a correlation between the
CFC metric and the maintainability of the BPMN models exists. The results of the
CFC validation are shown next.
5 Analysis and Validation of CFC Metric
The CFC metric presented in section 3 has been validated previously, by analyzing its
values in different process models represented with the METEOR workflow
management system and with respect to the subjective evaluation of such models by
process designers [18]. As a result, the authors conclude that the CFC metric is highly
correlated with the control-flow complexity of processes, and therefore can be used
by business process analysts and process designers to analyze the complexity of
processes and, to develop simpler processes, if possible.
In the current work, the aim is to corroborate if the CFC metric can be used to
analyze the complexity of business process developed with a standard notation such
as BPMN. Our goal is also to provide some insight based on objective data about the
metric’s influence on the easiness of understanding and modifying of BPMN models.
With this objective in mind the stated research hypotheses are:
- Null hypothesis, H : There is no significant correlation between the CFC metric
0u
and the understandability.
- Alternative hypothesis, H : There is a significant correlation between the CFC
1u
metric and the understandability.
- Null hypothesis, H : There is no significant correlation between the CFC metric
0m
and the modifiability.
- Alternative hypothesis, H : There is a significant correlation between the CFC
1m
metric and the modifiability.
5.1 Descriptive Analysis
Initially, in order to carry out the descriptive analysis, the values of the CFC metrics
of the models used in all the experiments were obtained (Table 5). The global values
of the CFC metrics reflect the degree of complexity of control-flows between process
models. For example, process models 7 and 10 of the first family have the highest
values of CFC. It is therefore possible to state that they have greater structural
complexity than process model number 1. In the second family, the highest CFC
values were obtained with the first five models, as these models contained more
gateways and sequence flows.
In both families of experiments, the dependent variables were measured 1) based
on the times that subjects needed to carry out the required tasks, 2) the percentage of
correct answers, 3) the subjective evaluation with regard to the complexity of the
models, and 4) the efficiency of the answers (this is calculated as the ratio between
the number of correct answers and the time needed to respond).

By analyzing the time taken by the subjects to carry out the required tasks, it is
possible to identify the process models in which more time was needed. For instance,
for the understandability tasks in the first family, the subjects took more time to
