### Product of Activities of the Model TNT

The following sections present the research context and an overview of the two families of experiments conducted to empirically validate the relationship between the proposed measures and the usability and maintainability of BPMN models.

#### 4.1 Research Context

The objective of conducting these families of experiments was to empirically validate the measures presented in [3] and determine which of these measures could provide useful and objective information about the external quality of business process models. The focus was primarily on two characteristics of ISO 9126 external quality: Usability (understandability) and Maintainability (modifiability). The results from the empirical validation of the first family are detailed in [5].

Initially, the measures were theoretically validated using the framework proposed by Briand et al. [16]. This allowed for the grouping of the measures based on the different properties of structural complexity they evaluate, such as size, coupling, and complexity (Fig. 2).

**Figure 2.** Relationship between structural complexity and quality attributes.

For the empirical validation of the defined measures, a series of experiments was planned and designed. Using the GQM (Goal Question Metric) template [17], the research objectives were set to analyze the measures of structural complexity in BPMs. The purpose was to evaluate their capability to serve as indicators of understandability and modifiability of BPMs, with the target participants being PhD students, research assistants, and others.

The hypotheses proposed were to determine if there is a significant correlation between the measurements of structural complexity and the subcharacteristics of understandability and modifiability. The independent variables were the measures defined for BPMN models, while the dependent variables were those related to the understandability and modifiability of BPMs. These dependent variables were measured based on response times, the number of correct answers, subjective evaluations, and task efficiency.

#### 4.2 First Family of Experiments

The first family of experiments consisted of five individual experiments, all designed with the same experimental setup. The experiments were conducted under similar conditions and contexts, with the same research objectives, hypotheses, and variables. A within-subjects design was used, where each participant completed all the tests.

Each participant received a set of ten BPMN models, randomly ordered, with varying degrees of structural complexity. For each model, two questionnaires were provided: one for understandability and another for modifiability. Additionally, a subjective question about the complexity of the model was included. A more detailed description of the materials can be found in [4].

The participants (Table 3) were selected based on their sufficient knowledge of modeling to perform the experimental tasks. A training session on business processes and BPMN standard notation was conducted before the experiments.

#### 4.3 Second Family of Experiments

The second family of experiments also included five individual experiments. The key difference was that separate experiments were designed to analyze understandability and modifiability. Specifically, the first three experiments focused on understandability, while the last two evaluated modifiability.

The experimental material for understandability consisted of fifteen BPMN models with varying structural characteristics and degrees of complexity. Each model had a questionnaire with three questions related to understandability. For modifiability, the experimental material included twelve BPMN models, each with a questionnaire containing two modification requirements. In all cases, participants answered a subjective question regarding the complexity of the process model [5].

Similar to the first family, the participants in the second family (Table 4) received a training session on BPMN.

#### 5. Analysis and Validation of CFC Metric

The CFC metric, introduced in section 3, has been previously validated by analyzing its values in different process models represented with the METEOR workflow management system and through subjective evaluations by process designers [18]. The authors concluded that the CFC metric is highly correlated with the control-flow complexity of processes, making it a valuable tool for business process analysts and designers to assess and simplify process complexity.

In the current work, the aim is to verify if the CFC metric can be used to analyze the complexity of business processes developed with a standard notation like BPMN. The goal is also to provide objective data on the metric's influence on the ease of understanding and modifying BPMN models. The research hypotheses are:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀u):** There is no significant correlation between the CFC metric and understandability.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁u):** There is a significant correlation between the CFC metric and understandability.
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀m):** There is no significant correlation between the CFC metric and modifiability.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁m):** There is a significant correlation between the CFC metric and modifiability.

#### 5.1 Descriptive Analysis

To conduct the descriptive analysis, the CFC metric values of the models used in all the experiments were obtained (Table 5). The global CFC values reflect the degree of control-flow complexity between process models. For example, process models 7 and 10 in the first family have the highest CFC values, indicating greater structural complexity compared to model 1. In the second family, the highest CFC values were observed in the first five models, which contained more gateways and sequence flows.

In both families of experiments, the dependent variables were measured based on:
1. The time subjects needed to complete the required tasks.
2. The percentage of correct answers.
3. Subjective evaluations regarding the complexity of the models.
4. The efficiency of the responses, calculated as the ratio between the number of correct answers and the time taken.

By analyzing the time taken by the subjects to complete the required tasks, it is possible to identify the process models that required more time. For instance, in the first family, the subjects took more time to complete the understandability tasks for certain models.
