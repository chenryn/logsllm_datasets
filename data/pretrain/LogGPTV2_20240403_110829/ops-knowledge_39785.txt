User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Haproxy logging doesn't work. Does that have anything to do with csf? Does Haproxy log every time a connection is made? I have followed instructions from other threads to set up logging via rsyslogd. Even though the files are created (haproxy.log,haproxy-info.log and haproxy-allbutinfo.log), no logs have been written into any of them. 

I have checked the lfg.log, and these may shed some light on the problem:

Sep 12 22:50:44 : *Suspicious Process* PID:17551 PPID:17551 User:haproxy Uptime:62 secs EXE:/usr/sbin/haproxy CMD:/usr/sbin/haproxy -D -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -p /var/run/haproxy.pid

The RESTRICT_SYSLOG is set to 3 in csf config. I have also added haproxy as an allowed user for rsyslogd in /etc/csf/csf.syslogusers but still no logs have been written. Can anyone tell me what is wrong with the following setup?

csf config

RESTRICT_SYSLOG = "3"

# Allow incoming UDP ports
UDP_IN = "20,21,53,514"

# Allow outgoing UDP ports
# To allow outgoing traceroute add 33434:33523 to this list 
UDP_OUT = "20,21,53,514"


/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

global
   log 127.0.0.1   local2       
   maxconn 2048             
   user haproxy
   group haproxy


/etc/rsyslog.d/haproxy.conf

$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerAddress 127.0.0.1
$UDPServerRun 514    
local2.*    /var/log/haproxy.log
local2.=info     /var/log/haproxy-info.log
local2.notice    /var/log/haproxy-allbutinfo.log


"haproxy" user added to /etc/csf/csf.syslogusers

  # Other users:
  haproxy   


Updated: I just disabled csf and tried again. Still haproxy doesn't write anything into the files.

Assistant: I have managed to get logs written into the file. 
Besides adding the log setting to the global section, I should have added a reference in the default section as well. To quote from this tutorial which is the only piece I have found mentions this important setting:


  In your backends or default config, refer to global:


   defaults
        log             global


My settings in /etc/rsyslog/haproxy.conf

$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514
$UDPServerAddress 127.0.0.1

local1.* -/var/log/haproxy_1.log
&amp; ~


It turns out there is nothing to do with csf. I have closed the UDP and the logging still works
