I have been using both LTW and Component scanning using 2.1 M3. (This is
actually for testing as we use Compile Time Weaving in the built application).  
Just tried with 2.1 M4, and it appears that duplicate bean definitions are
being generated, causing exceptions.
The XML config is as follows:  
[code]
[/code]
If any `@Component` is picked up by the scanning then the following exception
is thrown:  
[code]  
org.springframework.beans.factory.CannotLoadBeanClassException: Error loading
class [base.package.domain.ObjectWithDependencies] for bean with name
'objectWithDependencies' defined in null: problem with class file or dependent
class; nested exception is java.lang.LinkageError: duplicate class
definition:base/package/domain/ObjectWithDependencies  
[/code]
Is it now incorrect to combine the component scanning and load time weaving,
or is this unexpected behaviour?
Regards
