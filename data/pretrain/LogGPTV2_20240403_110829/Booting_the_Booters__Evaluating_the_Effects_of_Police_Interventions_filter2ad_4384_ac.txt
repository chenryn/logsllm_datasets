Table 3: Share of attacks by country of victim over
time (includes double-counting when attacks are at-
tributed to more than one country).
Although DoS attacks can be directed anywhere and be
for any purpose, prior studies have shown that most attacks
are on end-users (assumed to be games players) and on
gaming related websites [7, 48]. Sharma showed that timezone
determines when peak attacks occur [57] and we take the
view that there will be a significant correlation between the
country of the attacker and the country of the victim.
Table 3 sets out the eight countries which receive the high-
est number of DoS attacks and their percentage share over
the past five years. The US now accounts for the largest
number of UDP reflection attacks which we observe – 47%.
Note that this table, and the time series in Figure 3 in-
clude some double-counting as an artefact of how attacks are
conservatively assigned to countries.
There is strong correlation between the attack time series
for the UK, US, France, Germany and Poland (see Figure 4).
These countries all show a flat series until the beginning of
2017, then steady growth across 2017 and 2018 with a strong
seasonal pattern. The Netherlands is fairly similar, with a
slightly lower degree of correlation. Russia is lower still, with
less growth over time and smaller effects from interventions
(though still showing a reasonable degree of correlation with
the other series). China stands apart, showing no correlation
to the other nations or impact from interventions, with a
largely flat pattern over time and this lack of similarity led
us to exclude it from the analysis we presented in Table 2.
In the US, France, Germany, Netherlands, Russia, and
Poland, we observe a continuing upward trend from the
beginning of 2017 up to the Webstresser takedown in April
2018. In the UK, however, this upward trend flattened off
entirely from December 2017 until June 2018. This flat trend
continues until August, whereupon there was a large spike in
attacks and the series begins to grow again.
In Table 2, we present a comparison of the effects of
the different interventions we observe as significant at the
global level in individual countries. We selected seven nations
which had both large numbers of booter attacks and whose
booter markets we believed might credibly be expected to
experience disruption as a result of these interventions. We
ran negative binomial models (as described for the overall
attack series) for the series of attacks over time for each of

plete correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and -1
indicates negative correlation.

these nations, enabling us to judge whether significant effects
could be observed in different nations, and to compare the
size of these effects. Where the per-country data showed large
spikes localised around particular events (such as retaliation
against the Dutch police for the Webstresser arrests), these
were included as a component in the model. For reasons

of space, we do not present the details of the individual
per-country model parameters. The variation in effect sizes
between nations provide important evidence for a causal link
between interventions and the drops in attack numbers we
observe – for example, the Webstresser arrests show strong
negative effects in the US and Europe, but not in Russia
(as might be expected given their approach to extradition),
and correspond to a statistically significant increase in attack
numbers in the Netherlands (which we believe to be due to
reprisals against the Dutch police who led the action). France
is not significantly affected by a number of the interventions,
possibly accounted for by the existence of a large Francophone
booter market (where other European nations tend to use
English-language services) which may insulate it from news
reporting of major sentencing decisions and takedowns.
Figure 5 shows the figures for the US and the UK and
highlights the period during which the NCA were purchasing
search adverts (§2.7). As can be seen there is a strong case to
be made that the adverts, which were only displayed within
the UK, have caused a reduction in the number of attacks
on UK IP addresses. For comparison, the UK and US linear
trends from the period Jan 2017 until Dec 2017 had slopes
of 3.2 and 5.3 respectively, while for the period of the NCA
intervention, the US has a linear trend with a slope of 6.8,
while the UK trend has reduced to a nearly-flat slope of
-0.1. We believe that the adverts have led to a clear and
lasting reduction in the number of attacks. The US and UK
have a shared language and culture around booting with
participants often sharing similar online communities and so
correlation between growth rates would be expected. Attacks
on the UK are considerably lower in number (around 16%
as many per day on average) than attacks on the US, so
a suppression in UK growth due to the NCA intervention
would be unlikely to impact US growth even if UK targets
are hosted in the US.
4.2 Analysing by UDP protocol
Breaking attacks down by the UDP protocol used shows a
number of underlying patterns (Figure 6). Protocols appear
to go in and out of vogue at different times and there are short
term spikes. From analysis of booter attack logs we know
that booters experiment with switching to different protocols,
or perhaps choose not to reflect packets off the honeypots
providing our dataset [61], which may explain these spikes.
The steady rise in attack numbers from the beginning of
2017 to the end of 2018 appears to be largely driven by an
increase in attacks using the LDAP protocol which is the
only protocol with consistent growth over time. It has a large
amplification factor which has driven its popularity, but there
are not many real LDAP reflectors and so the honeypots are
likely to be used and continue to be used, so the data will be
very representative of overall traffic.
Many of the drops in attacks seen after interventions are
caused by drops in attacks for a particular protocol. This is
most likely due to the protocol only being used by a particular
booter. For the Webstresser takedown, we observe a small
drop in LDAP and a large drop in DNS. Some protocols are
perceived by users to be ‘best’ to use at that time, so the drop
seen following the shutdown of the HackForums SST section
was largely in the CHARGEN and NTP protocols, whereas
for the Xmas2018 intervention, the drop appears to largely
occur in the LDAP protocol, and to a lesser extent, DNS.
The recovery following this latter intervention sees increases
in DNS, LDAP and NTP attacks.
While in other countries the rise in LDAP largely drives
the overall upward trend across 2017 and 2018, in China this
is not the case, with LDAP largely replacing NTP attacks,
and the overall number of attacks remaining static. The rise
in LDAP takes place six months later in China than in the
rest of the world – near the end of 2017, rather than near the
beginning. Attacks against China use a much smaller range
of protocols than against the US, largely focusing on NTP
and SSDP, with LDAP increasingly prominent since the start
of 2018. The US, conversely, additionally sees substantial use
