Electron 0.36.0  
OS X 10.10.3  
BrowserWindow with `'title-bar-style'` set to `'hidden-inset'`.
**Problem:**  
There is always a draggable area at the top, even if I don't place any
elements there. It has a standard size for this type of windows in OS X (see
_System Preferences_ ). And I can't disable it for my buttons or other
elements by using `-webkit-app-region: no-drag;`.
I'm not sure but I think there wasn't such an issue in 0.35.
