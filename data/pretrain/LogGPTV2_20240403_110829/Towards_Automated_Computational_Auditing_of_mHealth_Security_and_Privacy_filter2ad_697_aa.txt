ABSTRACT
The growing complexity of our regulatory environment presents
us with a hard problem: how can we determine if we are compliant
with an ever-growing body of regulations? Computational legal
auditing may help, as computational tools are exceptionally good at
making sense of large amounts of data. In this research, we explore
the possibility of creating a computational auditor that checks if
mobile health (mHealth) apps satisfy federal security and privacy
regulations. In doing so, we find that while it is challenging to
convert open-ended, generally applicable, complicated laws into
computational principles, the use of non-legal, authoritative, ex-
planatory documents allows for computational operationalization
while preserving the open-ended nature of the law. We test our audi-
tor on 182 FDA/CE-approved mHealth apps. Our research suggests
that the use of non-legal, authoritative, guidance documents may
help with the creation of computational auditors, a promising tool
to help us manage our ever-growing regulatory responsibilities.

1 INTRODUCTION
As our world has grown in complexity, so have our laws. By one
measure, the United States Code has grown over 30x as long since
1935, and the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations has grown
almost 10x in length since 1938 [2, 5, 21]. Our growing legal system

is too complicated; it’s impossible for people to know all the laws
that apply to them. However, ignorance of the law is not an ex-
cuse; people are still subject to the law, even if they are unfamiliar
with it. Therein lies the need for computational legal analysis. Can
computational tools help us comply with an ever-growing body of
regulation?
To explore this question, we ask if it is possible to automatically
audit security and privacy compliance in a highly regulated indus-
try – mobile health (mHealth). mHealth apps have been lauded for
their potential to provide cheap, effective, and personalized health-
care to large groups of people [20]. In the past decade, mHealth
apps have exploded in popularity, and they have been critical in
the global response to COVID-19 [1, 23]. However, this explosive
growth has made the industry challenging to regulate, and security
concerns abound [19, 22]. Automated auditing is a scalable solu-
tion that would allow regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to check if mHealth apps satisfy security and
privacy regulations.
In this poster, we survey existing mHealth regulations and present
key challenges that make it difficult to create computational au-
ditors from legal requirements. Our key observation is that these
challenges may be overcome by not using the legal text in the cre-
ation of an auditor, but by using a non-legal, authoritative, guidance
document that explains regulatory intent. These documents may
already exist; we use one to create an auditor that checks if 182
FDA/CE-approved apps violate FDA security and privacy recom-
mendations. Our research suggests that the use of these non-legal,
authoritative, guidance documents is a promising approach for
computational auditing.
2 FEDERAL MHEALTH REGULATIONS
mHealth apps were grandfathered into the existing regulatory en-
vironment; therefore, they inherit the security and privacy regu-
lations that apply to traditional healthcare devices. Accordingly,
the FDA only plans to regulate mHealth apps that meet the legal
definition of a medical device [15], defined in 21 U.S.C. § 321(h).
The FDA often cites the United States Code (U.S.C.), the Code of
Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), and FDA guidance documents when
addressing mHealth regulations.
The U.S. Code is a codification of current laws passed by the
legislative branch of the United States. The U.S. Code contains 53
Titles and is organized by subject; for example, Title 21 of the U.S.C.
generally covers the laws applicable to food and drugs. The Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), which gives the FDA many
of its powers, is housed within Chapter 9 of 21 U.S.C.
The C.F.R. is the official codification of the rules and regulations
promulgated by departments and agencies of the executive branch

of the United States. While laws in the U.S.C. give executive bodies
(like the FDA) their powers, the C.F.R. describes how these bodies
choose to exercise their powers. One well-known example of the
C.F.R. is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (HIPAA). While the laws that comprise HIPAA are scattered
throughout the U.S.C., the rules that describe what HIPAA means
to the public are located in Title 45 of the C.F.R. Part 160, Part 162,
and Part 164.
FDA guidance documents often explain, elaborate, or comple-
ment parts of the C.F.R. These documents describe the FDA’s current
thinking about topics under its authority, including how the FDA
plans to regulate (or not regulate) mHealth applications. It’s impor-
tant to note that these guidance documents are only recommenda-
tions, with the exception of sections that cite specific regulatory or
statutory requirements. However, these documents offer invaluable
advice; for example, those who are required to submit their mHealth
application for premarket evaluation should familiarize themselves
with what the FDA says to include in premarket submissions. These
guidance documents cover many topics, and all 2,500+ guidance
documents are searchable online [18].
As an aside – our analysis is limited to federal mHealth security
and privacy regulations. Due to the large number of regulations,
state regulations (e.g., Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act)
and case law are considered out-of-scope of our analysis.
3 CHALLENGES
There are a few key challenges when creating a computational audi-
tor for legal affairs. Our research suggests that the use of non-legal,
authoritative, guidance documents may address these challenges.
This is illustrated in Figure 1.
that applies to all applications. Applications face different risks
due to their different operating requirements; it may be benefi-
cial to allow individual product developers to provide their own
application-specific security measures. However, a general standard
may be easier to enforce from a regulatory standpoint. The publica-
tion of non-legal, more-specific, regulatory guidelines allows the
best of both worlds: these recommendations are specific-enough to
guide inexperienced developers, yet do not constrain the security
solutions developed by more experienced teams.
Extensive dependencies vs. relevant regulations: Another
challenge developers face is navigating the large collection of docu-
ments that define our complicated regulatory environment. While
scholars are unsure about how to study legal complexity, one pro-
posed method is to measure how many other documents each legal
unit cites [3, 4]. We adopt this method to study the out-bound ci-
tation network for key mHealth FDA guidance documents. These
citation networks are critical. FDA guidance documents, laws, and
other policies do not exist in a vacuum. Oftentimes, these docu-
ments rely upon principles and regulations from other documents.
Therefore, to understand a document, one may need to be familiar
with its citations.
Figure 2 maps the out-bound citations for eleven key FDA mHealth
guidance documents [6–14, 16, 17]. These eleven original docu-
ments ultimately reference 133 other documents a total of 239 times.
On average, each of the original FDA guidance documents cites
21.72 other documents. Furthermore, these other documents have
their own dependency networks. The large number of regulations
that apply to mHealth apps may weaken the explanatory purpose
