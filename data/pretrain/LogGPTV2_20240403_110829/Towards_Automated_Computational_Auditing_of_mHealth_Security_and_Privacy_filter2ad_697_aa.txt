### Abstract
The increasing complexity of the regulatory environment presents a significant challenge: how can we ensure compliance with an ever-growing body of regulations? Computational legal auditing may offer a solution, as computational tools excel at processing large volumes of data. In this research, we explore the feasibility of developing a computational auditor to check if mobile health (mHealth) applications comply with federal security and privacy regulations. Our findings indicate that while it is challenging to translate open-ended, generally applicable, and complex laws into computational principles, the use of non-legal, authoritative, explanatory documents can facilitate this process while preserving the flexibility of the law. We tested our auditor on 182 FDA/CE-approved mHealth apps. Our research suggests that non-legal, authoritative guidance documents are a promising tool for creating computational auditors, which can help manage our growing regulatory responsibilities.

## 1. Introduction
As the world has grown more complex, so have our laws. The United States Code has expanded over 30 times since 1935, and the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations has grown almost 10 times in length since 1938 [2, 5, 21]. This expanding legal system is too intricate for individuals to fully comprehend, yet ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. This underscores the need for computational legal analysis. Can computational tools assist us in complying with an ever-increasing body of regulations?

To address this question, we investigate whether it is possible to automatically audit security and privacy compliance in a highly regulated industry—mobile health (mHealth). mHealth apps have been praised for their potential to provide affordable, effective, and personalized healthcare to large populations [20]. Over the past decade, these apps have gained immense popularity and played a crucial role in the global response to COVID-19 [1, 23]. However, this rapid growth has made the industry difficult to regulate, and security concerns are prevalent [19, 22]. Automated auditing offers a scalable solution, allowing regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to verify if mHealth apps meet security and privacy standards.

In this poster, we review existing mHealth regulations and highlight key challenges in creating computational auditors from legal requirements. We observe that these challenges can be overcome by using non-legal, authoritative, explanatory documents instead of the legal text. These documents, which may already exist, can be used to create an auditor. We test our auditor on 182 FDA/CE-approved apps and find that the use of such documents is a promising approach for computational auditing.

## 2. Federal mHealth Regulations
mHealth apps were integrated into the existing regulatory framework, inheriting the security and privacy regulations that apply to traditional healthcare devices. The FDA plans to regulate only those mHealth apps that meet the legal definition of a medical device, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 321(h) [15]. The FDA often references the United States Code (U.S.C.), the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), and FDA guidance documents when addressing mHealth regulations.

- **United States Code (U.S.C.)**: A codification of current laws passed by the U.S. legislative branch, organized by subject. For example, Title 21 of the U.S.C. covers laws related to food and drugs. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), which grants many of the FDA's powers, is found in Chapter 9 of 21 U.S.C.
- **Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.)**: The official codification of rules and regulations issued by U.S. executive branch departments and agencies. While the U.S.C. provides the powers, the C.F.R. describes how these powers are exercised. An example is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), whose rules are detailed in Title 45 of the C.F.R. (Parts 160, 162, and 164).
- **FDA Guidance Documents**: These documents explain, elaborate, or complement parts of the C.F.R., offering the FDA's current thinking on various topics, including mHealth app regulation. Although they are primarily recommendations, they provide valuable advice for premarket submissions and other regulatory processes. All 2,500+ guidance documents are searchable online [18].

Our analysis focuses on federal mHealth security and privacy regulations, excluding state regulations and case law due to the vast number of regulations.

## 3. Challenges
Creating a computational auditor for legal affairs presents several key challenges. Our research suggests that using non-legal, authoritative, explanatory documents can address these challenges, as illustrated in Figure 1.

- **General Standards vs. Application-Specific Measures**: General standards may be easier to enforce but may not account for the unique risks faced by different applications. Allowing developers to implement application-specific security measures can be beneficial, but a general standard is often easier to enforce. Non-legal, specific regulatory guidelines can bridge this gap by providing detailed recommendations without constraining experienced developers.
- **Extensive Dependencies vs. Relevant Regulations**: Developers must navigate a large collection of documents defining the regulatory environment. One method to study legal complexity is to measure the number of citations each document makes [3, 4]. We use this method to analyze the citation network for key mHealth FDA guidance documents. These networks are critical because understanding a document often requires familiarity with its citations.

Figure 2 maps the outbound citations for eleven key FDA mHealth guidance documents [6–14, 16, 17]. These documents reference 133 other documents a total of 239 times, with an average of 21.72 citations per document. The extensive dependencies in these documents can complicate the explanatory purpose, making it difficult to understand and apply the regulations.

### Conclusion
Our research demonstrates that non-legal, authoritative, explanatory documents can be effectively used to create computational auditors for mHealth security and privacy regulations. This approach helps manage the complexities of the regulatory environment and ensures better compliance. Future work will focus on refining these methods and expanding their application to other regulated industries.
