## Abstract
In recent years, several proposals have been made to introduce different levels of service in the Internet. One such proposal is the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture. This paper explores how policing actions and rate guarantees provided by the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB) translate into perceived benefits for video streaming applications, which have strong quality requirements. Our goal is to better understand the relationship between application-level quality measures and the network-level parameters that govern the delivery of EF-based service guarantees. 

We conducted an experimental investigation using modified and instrumented standard streaming video servers and clients to quantify the perceived quality of received video streams. Quality assessments were performed using a Video Quality Measurement tool based on the ANSI objective quality standard. Measurements were taken over both a local Diff-Serv testbed and the QBone, a QoS-enabled segment of the Internet2 infrastructure. The paper reports and analyzes the results of these measurements.

## 1. Introduction
As IP networks are increasingly used to carry a wide range of traffic types, there is a growing need for service differentiation to meet diverse service requirements. The Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture [1] supports this by specifying a small number of different "behaviors" for the network when forwarding packets. Our general goal is to understand how the better network guarantees provided by new capabilities like DiffServ translate into actual benefits for applications, particularly for video streaming.

Video streaming applications have become popular but are often hampered by the unpredictability of network quality, especially for high-bit-rate video. While early video transmissions over IP networks involved downloading compressed videos for local playback, progressive download technologies now allow clients to watch videos as they are being downloaded. However, these technologies face challenges in adapting to the uncertainty of network resource availability.

Our focus is not to argue for or against the use of DiffServ for video streaming, but rather to understand how the network-level mechanisms and their configuration translate into better video quality for users. Specifically, we aim to map the evolution of video quality as a function of various network-level parameters, such as token rate and burst size. We take the perspective of a typical user who relies on existing client and server technology and wants to determine the best way to connect across a DiffServ-enabled network.

Despite the simplicity of our formulation, achieving the goal of accurately evaluating the relationship between network parameters and user-level quality is challenging. We address this by considering a broad range of configurations and scenarios, including multiple types of video servers and clients, different video clips and encoding schemes, and various network configurations. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information, Section 3 describes the experimental setup, Section 4 presents the results and analysis, and Section 5 summarizes our findings and concludes the paper.

## 2. Background Material

### 2.1 The Differentiated Services Architecture
The DiffServ working group has specified the general architecture and the fields in the IP header to support it [1]. Two initial Per Hop Behaviors (PHBs) are defined to provide differentiated forwarding treatments in DiffServ-enabled networks. The key components of the DiffServ architecture are flow classifiers and policers at the edges, and scheduling and buffer management mechanisms in the core.

Policing actions at the network edge, enforced through a token bucket, control the rate and burstiness of traffic. The token bucket parameters (token rate and bucket depth) and the actions applied to non-conformant packets (dropping or shaping) play a major role in determining the level of service provided. The Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB [16] requires a small burst size and a policer that either drops or shapes non-conformant packets. Our focus is on the EF PHB, with the main variables being the token rate, token bucket depth, and whether the policer shapes or drops non-conformant packets.

### 2.2 Streaming Video Technologies
New streaming technologies use special servers to deliver video content intelligently and adaptively to clients. These servers continuously monitor the available resources (e.g., bandwidth) and adjust the data rate accordingly. Existing servers rely on either standard formats (e.g., MPEG) or proprietary formats (e.g., Windows Media Technology).

Standard servers, such as MPEG streaming servers, support MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 encoded video with different rates and frame sizes. These servers are designed for broadband environments and can generate bursty traffic. In contrast, the Video Charger™ server allows smaller message sizes, resulting in lower burstiness. We also experimented with a Windows Media Technologies™ server, which uses Microsoft Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) or Windows Media Video (WMV). These formats integrate and synchronize different media types and support multiple bandwidths within a single file.

### 2.3 Video Quality Assessments
Rating the quality of video streamed over IP networks is challenging, and there are no standard procedures. We adapted methods developed for traditional environments (e.g., television and video conferencing) to our setting. Standardized objective video quality assessment methods for digital video systems are still evolving, and we used a Video Quality Measurement tool based on the ANSI objective quality standard.

## 3. Experimental Setup
Our experimental setup consists of three main components: the video quality measurement tool, the setup to capture video information, and the different network testbed configurations. We used a variety of video servers and clients, different video clips and encoding schemes, and various network configurations, including a local Diff-Serv testbed and the QBone.

## 4. Results and Analysis
We present the results of our experiments and analyze the relationship and differences between network-level and user-level quality measures. The results show how different network parameters, such as token rate and burst size, affect the perceived video quality.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper provides a quantitative evaluation of the relationship between network-level parameters and user-level video quality in a DiffServ-enabled network. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully configuring network parameters to achieve the best possible video quality. Future work will further explore the impact of other network-level mechanisms and more complex scenarios.
