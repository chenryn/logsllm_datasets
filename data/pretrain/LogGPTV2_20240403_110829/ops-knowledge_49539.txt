Question: If an organization is designing a password management system with features similar to iCloud Keychain, what aspects of the iCloud Keychain's security and operational measures should be considered for implementation to ensure secure synchronization and recovery of passwords?
"A": "Passwords are stored on the organization's servers in plain text to facilitate easy recovery in case of user account issues.",
"B": "A syncing circle is created using public and private keys, which is then signed with a key derived from the user's account password for secure syncing between devices.",
"C": "The user's passwords are synced between devices without any form of encryption, relying solely on the security of the user's iCloud account.",
"D": "For two-factor authentication accounts, an additional syncing circle with its own set of asymmetric elliptical keys is created and stored in a secure cloud service."
