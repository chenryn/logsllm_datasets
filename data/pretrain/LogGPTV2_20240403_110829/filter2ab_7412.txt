### Title: Botconf2018 Code Cartographer’s Diary

At the 2017 Botconf, we introduced Malpedia [1], a community-driven initiative aimed at creating a free and independent resource for rapid malware identification and actionable context during investigations. While our previous presentation primarily focused on an overview of PE header characteristics, this talk will delve deeper into the results of over two years of in-depth analysis. Our focus will be on the unpacked representatives of more than 700 families of Windows malware.

**Part 1: Windows API Usage Patterns**
In the first part of this presentation, we will explore the usage patterns of the Windows API as exhibited by malware. To achieve this, we have extended ApiScout [2] with a method to extract API usage fingerprints. We will demonstrate how this information can be used to reliably identify and characterize malware families. Additionally, we will show that these API usage patterns often reflect the habits and preferences of the respective malware authors.

**Part 2: SMDA and Control Flow Graph Recovery**
In the second part, we will introduce SMDA [3], a minimalist recursive disassembler library optimized for accurate Control Flow Graph (CFG) recovery from memory dumps. The output from SMDA allows us to create a function index, which can be used to identify similar code. This similarity information can be leveraged in two ways:
- **Third-Party Library Recognition:** We can recognize and measure the prevalence of third-party libraries used in malware.
- **Unique Code Identification:** We can isolate the unique, characteristic code of each malware family to derive detection signatures.

By combining these approaches, we aim to provide a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the behavior and structure of Windows malware.

This presentation aims to provide valuable insights and tools for the malware analysis community, enhancing our collective ability to detect, analyze, and mitigate the threats posed by Windows malware.
