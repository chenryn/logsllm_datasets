[]{#c12.xhtml#Page_181 .pagebreak title="181" role="doc-pagebreak"}Once
you have built your Clonezilla Live USB, you can boot your target
machine with it. You may have to edit the BIOS of the machine to be able
to boot to USB. Set USB as the first priority when you edit the BIOS.
With Clonezilla Live, you are able to save an image and restore that
image. In Clonezilla Live, []{#c12.xhtml#Page_182 .pagebreak title="182"
role="doc-pagebreak"}two accounts are available. The first account is
"user" with sudo privilege, and the password is "live." A sudo account
will allow users to run programs with the security privileges of a
superuser. Sudo means "superuser do." The second account is an
administration account "root" with no password. You cannot log in as
root. If you need root privilege, you can log in as **user** and run
`sudo ‐i` to become root.
In [Lab 12.6](#c12.xhtml#c12-fea-0006){#c12.xhtml#R_c12-fea-0006},

When in doubt, keep the defaults except at the end of the cloning
configuration. When everything is finished, choose `‐p poweroff` as your
final selection because this will shut off the machine. If you are not
paying very close attention at the end of this cloning process, it could
restart the entire process since you are booting with a USB, and you\'ll
end up right back at step 1 of configuring the clone. (Yes, that has
happened to me many times.) You won\'t forget to properly eject the USB
and accidentally corrupt it.
[]{#c12.xhtml#Page_185 .pagebreak title="185" role="doc-pagebreak"}To
restore the image, follow steps 1 through 5 in [Lab
12.6](#c12.xhtml#c12-fea-0006). At that point in the process, you should
choose `restoredisk` instead of `savedisk`. Choose the image name you
just cloned and then the destination disk where you want to deploy the
image.
With Clonezilla SE, I\'ve been on a team that imaged over 100 new
machines a week. When I was teaching at Fort Carson, we had two
classrooms with 18 computers each and 36 laptops that we recycled the
image on every month. I would harden the OS and then load all the files
that students would need for the CompTIA, ISC2, Microsoft, and Cisco
classes. The certification boot camps we taught were either 5 days or 10
days, or for CISSP, 15‐day classes. Class ended Friday at 5 p.m., and
the next class started Monday at 8 a.m. We needed to be fast and as
efficient as possible. Remember, my job is to make your life easier, and
these are tools that will help.

Most people think that cyberattackers are going to use high‐tech, very
advanced techniques to hack into their accounts and infect their
systems. The simple truth is that the easiest way to hack a system is
through human hacking or social engineering. Kevin Mitnick,
world‐renowned social engineer says, "Companies spend millions of
dollars on firewalls and secure access devices, and it\'s money wasted
because none of these measures address the weakest link in the security
chain: the people who use, administer, and operate computer systems." It
takes only one person clicking one link and downloading one malicious
exploit.[]{#c13.xhtml#Page_188 .pagebreak title="188"

## Human Nature {#c13.xhtml#head-2-97}
We are funny creatures, we humans. We have put men on the moon and
nearly wiped out polio on the face of the earth, but when faced with the
elevator not coming as fast as we like, we press the button over and
over thinking it might speed things up a bit. If I am waiting at the
elevator with you, I have already made several assumptions about you and
your need to get where you\'re going as quickly as possible. First
impressions are very important in social engineering. You have
approximately 8 seconds before people will have a solid impression of
who you are, and it is difficult to overcome a first impression.
Social engineering is practiced every day by everyone in every walk of
life. If you have ever had a job interview, you attempted to social
engineer the interviewer into giving you the job. If you have ever had a
first date, you were attempting to make someone like you enough to go on
a second one. Social engineering is when person A attempts to manipulate
person B into doing what person A wants person B to do. It doesn\'t have
to be malicious or evil. It could simply be a marketing company trying
to sell you a car you don\'t really need. It could be a political
candidate campaigning for your vote or a magazine telling you what you
should wear. Social engineering is using influence by whatever means
necessary to get what you want. It could be a vote, a sale, a vacation,
or your administrative credentials.
In cybersecurity, this is done through any type of social interaction
whether in person, over the phone, or over the Internet. The absolute
best defense is training and education. If you can recognize that
someone is attempting to influence you, you become hyperaware to the
attempt. If you look at the results of the DEFCON Social Engineering
Capture the Flag (CTF), it is obvious that the winners employ the "6
Principles of Persuasion" laid out by Professor Robert Caildini. In his
research and what he believes to be the science behind getting people to
say "yes" are six fundamentals that guide human behavior:
-   [Reciprocity]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0005}
-   [Scarcity]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0006}
-   [Authority]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0007}
-   [Consistency]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0008}
-   [Liking]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0009}
-   [Consensus]{#c13.xhtml#c13-li-0010}
Reciprocity is defined as being an exchange for mutual benefit. You
scratch my back, and I will scratch yours. You may have heard this in
Latin as *quid pro quo*. In IT social engineering, I have seen this as a
simple, "Please click this link and fill out this survey for a \$5 gift
card." As a pen testing campaign against []{#c13.xhtml#Page_189
.pagebreak title="189" role="doc-pagebreak"}an organization, it works
extremely well unless your end users are aware of attacks like these. If
you are the one creating the attack, be the first to make an offer and
make sure it is meaningful.
A used car lot is the epitome of social engineering. "Someone was here
an hour ago, and they really want this car." Scarcity creates a sense of
urgency. People want more of the things they cannot have. With any type
of social engineering, the timing is key, but especially with scarcity.
I have seen this used in password reset emails. What do people stand to
lose if they do not do as you ask? They lose access to their files, they
can\'t do their job; now they can\'t pay the rent, and they\'re
homeless. A little extreme, but it does create a sense of urgency.
A few years ago, I was an adjunct instructor teaching a computer class
for a nursing school. The chancellor had asked all the professors to
wear a white doctor\'s coat, even if we were not teaching medical
classes. At the time, I thought it was a little odd until I went to pick
up a prescription for my daughter. Even the pharmacist assumed I was in
a position of authority and had me come to the head of the line. Then it
clicked. The students had been conditioned to recognize the doctor\'s
coat to be the authority figure. If someone wears a uniform, people will
naturally follow the lead of that person. It is important to signal to
others what makes you a credible, knowledgeable authority before you try
to influence them.
Greg Foss, senior researcher at Carbon Black, told me of a time that he
was conducting a penetration test and consistency was the theme of his
experiment. He had created a Google phone number, created a voicemail
mailbox message, and called his target at a time when he knew the target
was not going to be around. He left a message to have that person call
him back because he needed to help the individual with a problem that
person was having. They played telephone tag a few times, which built a
foundation of trust and consistency with the target.
There are three major components to the principle of liking. We like
people who are like us---we naturally gravitate to them. We like people
who pay us compliments, and we like people who have the same goals as we
do. We like them even more if they are willing to help us get us to our
goal. One of the fun things to try to do with social engineering is to
have someone form a goal of his or her own volition that we have
actually orchestrated. The very first thing you should do in a job
interview is find some commonality with the interviewer, and in your
mind‐set, the interviewer is a friend, not an adversary. Now the goal
for that person is to woo you to the organization, and you are now
