Patterns of SCADA logs
SCADA logs present obvious three kinds of patterns, which
correspond to the 3 deﬁned node sets:
• Setpoint set S. Setpoint variables are of constant values,
shown in Figs. 20(a)-20(c);
• Sensor set Y. Sensor readings are of consistent and small
vibrations, shown in Figs. 20(d)-20(n).
• Command set U. Control commands are of continu-
ous/smooth values, as shown in Figs. 20(o)-20(q).
Evaluating PLC-Sleuth on TE
Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, as shown in Fig. 21, is
widely used for evaluating threats and protection methods
designed for cyber physical systems.
We deploy the command injection attack and the cooper-
ative stealthy attack on the 17 control loops of TE. Fig. 22
shows the impacts of four example attacks.
As a typical control system, the control commands in TE
have strong correlations with the concomitant sensor readings,
shown as the black line in Fig. 23. This correlations can
be quantiﬁed as command weights wukyj s. However, the two
scenarios of attacks both damage the correlations and cause
command weights’ variation, shown as the red and purple line
in Fig. 23.
By utilizing the variation of command weights,
PLC-Sleuth detects attacks with {100%/0%} true/false
positives, and localizes the compromised control loops with
96.76% accuracy. Details of the detection/localization results
are listed in Table 3.
