Table 4: A summary of our identiﬁed mining pool activity, in
terms of the number of associated addresses used in coingen
transactions, and the numbers of each type of transaction inter-
acting with the pool.
Figure 10: Over time, the value of deposits made by known
mining pools into the shielded pool.
6.2.1 Deposits
As discussed earlier and seen in Figure 6, it is easy to
identify miner deposits into the pool due to the fact that
they immediately follow a coin generation. Before go-
ing further, we split the category of miners into indi-
vidual miners, who operate on their own, and mining
pools, which represent collectives of potentially many
individuals. In total, we gathered 19 t-addresses associ-
ated with Zcash mining pools, using the scraping meth-
ods described in Section 5.2. Table 4 lists these mining
pools, as well as the number of addresses they control
and the number of t-to-z transactions we associated with
them. Figure 10 plots the value of their deposits into the
shielded pool over time.
In this ﬁgure, we can clearly see that the two domi-
nant mining pools are Flypool and F2Pool. Flypool con-
sistently deposits the same (or similar) amounts, which
we can see in their linear representation. F2Pool, on the
other hand, has bursts of large deposits mixed with pe-
riods during which it is not very active, which we can
also see reﬂected in the graph. Despite their different be-
haviors, the amount deposited between the two pools is
similar.
6.2.2 Withdrawals
While the withdrawals from the pool do not solely re-use
the small number of mining addresses identiﬁed using
deposits (as we saw in our na¨ıve attempt to link miner
z-to-t transactions in Figure 8a), they do typically re-use
some of them, so can frequently be identiﬁed anyway.
In particular, mining pool payouts in Zcash are sim-
ilar to how many of them are in Bitcoin [27, 18]. The
block reward is often paid into a single address, con-
trolled by the operator of the pool, and the pool operator
then deposits some set of aggregated block rewards into
the shielded pool. They then pay the individual reward
to each of the individual miners as a way of “sharing the
pie,” which results in z-to-t transactions with many out-
puts. (In Bitcoin, some pools opt for this approach while
some form a “peeling chain” in which they pay each
individual miner in a separate transaction, sending the
change back to themselves each time.) In the payouts for
some of the mining pools, the list of output t-addresses
sometimes includes one of the t-addresses known to be
associated with the mining pool already. We thus tag
these types of payouts as belonging to the mining pool,
according to the following heuristic:
Heuristic 4. If a z-to-t transaction has over 100 output t-
addresses, one of which belongs to a known mining pool,
then we label the transaction as a mining withdrawal (as-
sociated with that pool), and label all non-pool output
t-addresses as belonging to miners.
As with Heuristic 3, short of asking the mining pool
operators directly it is impossible to validate this heuris-
tic. Nevertheless, given the known operating structure
of Bitcoin mining pools and the way this closely mirrors
that structure, we again believe it to be relatively safe.
As a result of running this heuristic, we tagged
110,918 addresses as belonging to miners, and linked a
much more signiﬁcant portion of the z-to-t transactions,
as seen in Figure 8c. As the last column in Table 4
shows, however, this heuristic captured the activity of
only a small number of the mining pools, and the large
jump in linked activity is mostly due to the high cov-
erage with F2Pool (one of the two richest pools). This
implies that further heuristics developed speciﬁcally for
other pools, such as Flypool, would increase the linka-
bility even more. Furthermore, a more active strategy in
which we mined with the pools to receive payouts would
reveal their structure, at which point (according to the

remaining value of 1.2M attributed to the ‘other’ cate-
gory shown in Figure 8c) we would shrink the anonymity
set even further.4
6.3 Other Entities
Once the miners and founders have been identiﬁed, we
can assume the remaining transactions belong to more
general entities.
In this section we look into different
means of categorizing these entities in order to identify
how the shielded pool is being used.
In particular, we ran the heuristic due to Ques-
nelle [36], which said that if a unique value (i.e., a value
never seen in the blockchain before or since) is deposited
into the pool and then, after some short period of time,
the exact same value is withdrawn from the pool, the de-
posit and the withdrawal are linked in what he calls a
round-trip transaction.
Heuristic 5. [36] For a value v, if there exists exactly one
t-to-z transaction carrying value v and one z-to-t transac-
tion carrying value v, where the z-to-t transaction hap-
pened after the t-to-z one and within some small number
of blocks, then these transactions are linked.
In terms of false positives, the fact that the value is
unique in the blockchain means that the only possibil-
ity of a false positive is if some of the z-to-z transac-
tions split or aggregated coins in such a way that another
deposit (or several other deposits) of a different amount
were altered within the pool to yield an amount identical
to the initial deposit. While this is possible in theory, we
observe that of the 12,841 unique values we identiﬁed,
9,487 of them had eight decimal places (the maximum
number in Zcash), and 98.9% of them had more than
three decimal places. We thus view it as highly unlikely
that these exact values were achieved via manipulations
in z-to-z transactions.
By running this heuristic, we identiﬁed 12,841 unique
values, which means we linked 12,841 transactions. The
values total 1,094,513.23684 ZEC and represent 28.5%
of all coins ever deposited in the pool. Interestingly, most
(87%) of the linked coins were in transactions attributed
to the founders and miners, so had already been linked
by our previous heuristics. We believe this lends further
credence to their soundness. In terms of the block inter-
val, we ran Heuristic 5 for every interval between 1 and
100 blocks; the results are in Figure 11.
As this ﬁgure shows, even if we assume a conservative
block interval of 10 (meaning the withdrawal took place
4It is possible that we have already captured some of the Flypool
activity, as many of the miners receive payouts from multiple pools.
We thus are not claiming that all remaining activity could be attributed
to Flypool, but potentially some substantial portion.

the block interval required between the deposit and withdrawal
transactions.
25 minutes after the deposit), we still capture 70% of the
total value, or over 700K ZEC. If we require the with-
drawal to have taken place within an hour of the deposit,
we get 83%.

Interactions within the Shielded Pool
In this section we consider private transactions; i.e., z-to-
z transactions that interact solely with the shielded pool.
As seen in Section 4.1, these transactions form a small
percentage of the overall transactions. However, z-to-z
transactions form a crucial part of the anonymity core of
Zcash. In particular, they make it difﬁcult to identify the
round-trip transactions from Heuristic 5.
Our analysis identiﬁed 6,934 z-to-z transactions, with
8,444 vJoinSplits. As discussed in Section 3.1, the only
information revealed by z-to-z transactions is the miner’s
fee, the time of the transaction, and the number of vJoin-
Splits used as input. Of these, we looked at the time of
transactions and the number of vJoinSplits in order to
gain some insight as to the use of these operations.
We found that 93% of z-to-z transactions took just one
vJoinSplit as input. Since each vJoinSplit can have at
most two shielded outputs as its input, the majority of
z-to-z transactions thus take no more than two shielded
outputs as their input. This increases the difﬁculty of cat-
egorizing z-to-z transactions, because we cannot know if
a small number of users are making many transactions,
or many users are making one transaction.
In looking at the timing of z-to-z transactions, how-
ever, we conclude that it is likely that a small number of
users were making many transactions. Figure 12 plots
the cumulative number of vJoinSplits over time. The
occurrences of vJoinSplits are somewhat irregular, with
17% of all vJoinSplits occurring in January 2017. There
are four other occasions when a sufﬁcient number of
vJoinSplits occur within a sufﬁciently short period of
time as to be visibly noticeable. It seems likely that these

which exploits were being purchased.
each of these months. The last blog post was made in Oc-
tober 2017, when they stated that all subsequent dumps
would cost 500 ZEC.
To identify potential TSB transactions, we thus looked
at all t-to-z transactions not associated with miners or
founders that deposited either 100, 200, 400, or 500 ZEC
± 5 ZEC. Our assumption was that users paying TSB
were not likely to be regular Zcash users, but rather were
using it with the main purpose of making the payment.
On this basis, addresses making t-to-z transactions of the
above values were ﬂagged as a potential TSB customer
if the following conditions held:
1. They did not get their funds from the pool; i.e., there
were no z-to-t transactions with this address as an
output. Again, if this were a user mainly engaging
with Zcash as a way to pay TSB, they would need to
to buy their funds from an exchange, which engage
only with t-addresses.
2. They were not a frequent user, in the sense that they
had not made or received more than 250 transac-
tions (ever).
3. In the larger cluster in which this address belonged,
the total amount deposited by the entire cluster into
the pool within one month was within 1 ZEC of
the amounts requested by TSB. Here, because the
resulting clusters were small enough to treat man-
ually, we applied not only Heuristic 1 but also
Heuristic 2 (clustering by change), making sure to
weed out false positives. Again, the idea was that
suspected TSB customers would not be frequent
users of the pool.

occurrences belong to the same group of users, or at least
by users interacting with the same service.
Finally, looking back at the number of t-to-z and z-
to-t transactions identiﬁed with mining pools in Table 4,
it is possible that BitClub Pool is responsible for up to
1,300 of the z-to-z transactions, as it had 196 deposits
into the pool and 1,516 withdrawals. This can happen
only because either (1) the pool made extra z-to-z trans-
actions, or (2) it sent change from its z-to-t transactions
back into the shielded pool. As most of BitClub Pool’s
z-to-t transactions had over 200 output t-addresses, how-
ever, we conclude that the former explanation is more
likely.
8 Case Study: The Shadow Brokers
The Shadow Brokers (TSB) are a hacker collective that
has been active since the summer of 2016, and that leaks
tools supposedly created by the NSA. Some of these
leaks are released as free samples, but many are sold via
auctions and as monthly bundles. Initially, TSB accepted
payment only using Bitcoin. Later, however, they be-
gan to accept Zcash for their monthly dump service. In
this section we discuss how we identiﬁed t-to-z transac-
tions that could represent payments to TSB. We identi-
ﬁed twenty-four clusters (created using our analysis in
Section 5) matching our criteria for potential TSB cus-
tomers, one of which could be a regular customer.
8.1 Techniques
In order to identify the transactions that are most likely
to be associated with TSB, we started by looking at
their blog [5]. In May 2017, TSB announced that they
would be accepting Zcash for their monthly dump ser-
vice. Throughout the summer (June through August)
they accepted both Zcash and Monero, but in Septem-
ber they announced that they would accept only Zcash.
Table 5 summarizes the amount they were requesting in
As with our previous heuristics, there is no way to
quantify the false-positive risks associated with this set
of criteria, although we see below that many of the trans-
actions matching it did occur in the time period associ-
ated with TSB acceptance of Zcash. Regardless, given
this limitation we are not claiming that our results are
deﬁnitive, but do believe this to be a realistic set of crite-
ria that might be applied in the context of a law enforce-
ment investigation attempting to narrow down potential
suspects.
