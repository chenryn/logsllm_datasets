tial unforgeability of the underlying signature scheme under
chosen-message attack (i.e. being euf-cma [20]). This is
true because if the signature is not euf-cma, the adversary
will be able to forge a new message-signature pair (i.e. a
new credential) by properly querying the signing oracle in
the ﬁrst phase of the cop-imp-ca attack, and successfully
prove ownership of the credential in the second phase.
It is easy to see that a ZK proof of knowledge of a mem-
ber of the NP language L(pk,m) = {σ : Verify (pk, m, σ)} is
a cop-imp-ca-secure COP given that the underlying signa-
ture is euf-cma. To prove this, one can construct a signa-
ture forger out of a COP impersonator as follows. Honest
credential-holders can be simulated without knowing a sig-
nature in the ﬁrst phase since the protocol is zero knowledge.
In the second phase, a valid signature can be extracted from
the cheating prover since the protocol is a proof of knowl-
edge. The obtained signature constitutes a forgery for the
signature scheme. In the following sections though, we seek
more eﬃcient ways to realize cop-imp-ca-secure COPs.
4. GENERIC CONSTRUCTION FROM IBE
As stated before, it is known that a secure signature scheme
can be constructed based on a secure identity-based encryp-
tion (IBE). In this section, we give a generic construction of
a COP associated to the mentioned signature scheme based
on any IBE scheme and prove it cop-imp-ca-secure assum-
ing one-wayness of the IBE under chosen ciphertext attacks
(denoted by owe-id-cca). owe-id-cca is a new security
notion for IBE schemes which is weaker than indistinguisha-
ind-id-cca), a
bility under chosen ciphertext attacks (i.e.
widely-accepted security notion for IBE schemes formalized
in [7, 8]. Our results in this section provides constructions
165
that if the underlying standard identiﬁcation and signature
schemes are secure, then the resulted certiﬁcate-based IBI
is also secure. Hence, IBIs achieving high levels of security
such as security against impersonation under concurrent at-
tacks (which we denote by id-imp-ca) can be constructed.
In an independent work, Kurosawa and Heng [22] intro-
duced a new general construction of IBI using signature
schemes with honest-veriﬁer zero-knowledge protocols for
proof of knowledge of a signature on a mutually-known mes-
sage. However, their IBI only achieves security against im-
personation under passive attacks assuming that the under-
lying signature scheme is secure and the protocol is HVZK-
PoK. Interestingly, in this section we show that security
against impersonation under concurrent attacks (id-imp-ca)
can be achieved if their construction is applied to a signature
with an associated credential ownership proof (henceforth
SS+COP), instead of a signature with their requirements!
Furthermore, we show that SS+COPs and IBIs are actually
equivalent, i.e. each of them can be employed instead of the
other only by renaming the entities, algorithms and param-
eters in use. Such equivalence implies yet another generic
construction for secure COPs.
The Equivalence between Schemes. A SS+COP is
a scheme through which a credential-issuer generates signa-
tures on messages and later on, a credential-holder proves to
a veriﬁer, who only knows the credential-issuer’s public key,
that she is in possession of a signature on a mutually-known
message. Similarly, an IBI is a scheme through which an
authority generates user secret keys for user identities and
later on, a user proves to a veriﬁer, who only knows the au-
thority’s master public key, that she is in possession of a user
secret key of a mutually-known identity. From this simple
comparison, the equivalence shown in Table 2 between the
entities, algorithms and parameters in the two schemes, i.e.
SS+COP scheme SS. (KeyGen, Sign, Verify) + SS-COP. (P, V)
and IBI scheme IBI.(cid:0)MKeyGen, UKeyGen, (P, V)(cid:1) becomes ap-
parent. Note that, similar to signatures, a user secret key
is also publicly veriﬁable (at least by simulating the identi-
ﬁcation protocol).
We call the transform which uses Table 2 to rename en-
tities, algorithms and parameters in a given SS+COP to
convert it to an IBI scheme, COP-2-IBI transform. The cor-
responding reverse transform is likewise denoted IBI-2-COP
transform. In what follows, we show that if these transforms
are applied to secure input schemes, they will yield secure
output schemes. This fact enables us to construct each of
the schemes from an implementation of the other.
Theorem 2. The scheme COP-2-IBI (SS, SS-COP) is an
id-imp-ca-secure identity-based identiﬁcation assuming that
SS-COP is a cop-imp-ca-secure credential ownership proof,
the construction IBI-2-COP (IBI) is a
and vice versa, i.e.
euf-cma signature with an associated cop-imp-ca-secure
credential ownership proof assuming that IBI is an id-imp-ca-
secure identity-based encryption.
Proof. (Sketch) Security in a SS+COP scheme trans-
lates into a guarantee that no poly-time adversary is able to
impersonate a credential-holder, even if it can have a signa-
ture on any message it wishes (i.e. corrupt any credential
holder it wants) and can interact concurrently with clones
of credential-holders on messages of its choice. Likewise, se-
curity in an IBI scheme translates into a guarantee that no
poly-time adversary is able to impersonate a user, even if it
and the randomized veriﬁcation algorithm is as follows:
IBESig.Verify (pk, m, σ)
P $← {0, 1}∗
C ← IBE.Enc (pk, m, P )
R ← IBE.Dec (par, σ, C)
b ← (P = R)
b ←|
As one may notice, the veriﬁcation algorithm in IBESig in-
herently has a challenge-response structure. We use this
structure to deﬁne the IBE-based credential ownership proof
IBE-COP as follows:
[IBE-COP.P (σ) ↔ IBE-COP.V] (pk, m)
StP ← (σ, pk, m) , StV ← (pk, m)
IBE-COP.P (C, StP)
R ← IBE.Dec (pk, σ, C)
R ←|
C(cid:17)−−−
R−−−(cid:16)
IBE-COP.V (ε, StV)
P $← {0, 1}∗
, StV ← P
C ← IBE.Enc (pk, m, P )
(C, StV) ←|
IBE-COP.V (R, StV)
d ← (P = R)
d ←|
In other words, the veriﬁer sends the prover a challenge ci-
phertext, obtained using encryption of a random plaintext,
and expects the prover to be able to decrypt it using the
signature she knows and reply with a response equal to the
plaintext. We prove that this construction is cop-imp-ca-
secure.
Theorem 1. IBE-COP is a cop-imp-ca-secure credential
ownership proof if IBE is an owe-id-cca identity-based en-
cryption.
The proof is given in Appendix D. We note that this the-
orem is also of theoretical interest. Waters [29], constructed
eﬃcient IBE schemes secure under the standard BDH as-
sumption and without random oracle. Combining this result
with Theorem 1 implies that a secure signature with asso-
ciated COP can be constructed in standard model, without
requiring random oracle or strong assumptions (such as one-
more RSA).
As noted before, cop-imp-ca security implies euf-cma.
Hence, we have the following as a corollary. Note that
this result is stronger than the previous observation, which
claimed euf-cma security for IBESig given that the under-
lying IBE is ind-id-cca.
Corollary 1. IBESig is euf-cma assuming that IBE is
owe-id-cca.
5. EQUIVALENCE WITH IBI
An identity-based identiﬁcation scheme (IBI) is a scheme
through which an entity can identify herself to a veriﬁer
who only knows the claimed identity and a public key of an
authority. The widely-accepted framework of security for
such schemes is security against impersonation under pas-
sive, active, or concurrent attacks formalized in [3]. In the
same paper, Bellare, Namprempre, and Neven show that
there exists a trivial general construction of IBI schemes
with building blocks of standard identiﬁcation and signa-
ture schemes, called certiﬁcate-based IBI. They also prove

veriﬁer such that X = xe mod N holds for some mutually-
known pkGQ = (N, e, X). To identify herself, the prover
ﬁrst sends a commitment Y to the receiver which is then
replied by a challenge c from the veriﬁer. Finally, the prover
answers with a response z. The veriﬁer then makes the
decision d by testing whether or not the equation ze = Y ·X c
mod N holds. The scheme is transcribed in Appendix A.
Bellare and Palacio prove that this identiﬁcation scheme is
secure against concurrent impersonation attacks [5] (called
imp-ca, see Appendix B for deﬁnition) provided that the
challenge length is super-logarithmic and the one-more RSA
inversion problem [4] is hard.
6.2 RSA-FDH Credential Ownership Proof
The RSA-FDH signature scheme is proposed and proved
existentially unforgeable under chosen message attack by
Bellare and Rogaway [6]. Brieﬂy, the scheme uses an RSA
modulus generator GenRSA to generate keys, assigns a sig-
nature of the form [H(m)]d mod N to a message m, and
a veriﬁes a candidate signature σ by checking whether or
not σe = H(m) mod N . The complete transcription of the
scheme comes in Appendix C. We deﬁne the COP protocol
RSA-COP as follows.
[RSA-COP.P (σ) ↔ RSA-COP.V] (pk, m)
pkGQ ←(cid:0)N, e, H(m)(cid:1)
skGQ ← (N, σ)
b ← [GQ.P (skGQ) ↔ GQ.V] (pkGQ)
b ←|
Note that in analogy with GQ, in RSA-COP the prover proves
knowledge of a value σ to the veriﬁer such that H(m) = σe
mod N holds for some mutually-known N , H(m), and e.
Proving completeness of the protocol is straightforward:
Completeness of GQ translates into the equation σe = H(m)
mod N , which holds given the validity of the RSA-FDH
signature. We prove security of the protocol against cop-
imp-ca attacks.
Theorem 3. RSA-COP is cop-imp-ca-secure in the ran-
dom oracle model assuming that GQ is secure against con-
current impersonation attack. Quantitatively speaking, we
have
Insec
cop-imp-ca
RSA-COP
(k) ≤ O (qs) · Insec
imp-ca
GQ
(k) ,
where qs is the number of credentials the issuer signs.
Proof. (Sketch) We present a construction of an imp-
ca adversary AGQ for GQ which uses a successful cop-imp-
ca adversary A for RSA-COP as a subroutine. AGQ, given
pkGQ = (N, e, X) as input, simulates A’s hash and signing
oracle queries following Coron’s method [12], i.e. embeds
X in the hash values of some hash queries (H(mi) = X · re
i
mod N ) and answers others randomly (H(mi) = re
i mod N ).
This way, AGQ is also able to answer signing oracle queries
mi, if X is not embedded in H(mi), as σi = [H(mi)]d =
ri. However, AGQ fails whenever it is asked a signing oracle
can have the user secret key of any identity it wishes (i.e.
corrupt any identity it wants) and can interact concurrently
with clones of users with identities of its choice. A thor-
ough examination of the two security deﬁnitions, i.e. the
deﬁnition of our cop-imp-ca notion in Deﬁnition 3 and the
id-imp-ca notion in [3, p. 275], shows that (barring notation
and some minor details2) they are indeed equivalent if the
entities, algorithms, and parameters are properly renamed
according to Table 2.
Note that the second part of Theorem 2 particularly en-
ables one to construct several cop-imp-ca-secure COP pro-
tocols (plus several euf-cma signatures) out of the many
id-imp-ca-secure IBI schemes proposed to date, based on
a range of diﬀerent computational assumptions. For a col-
lection of provably-secure IBI schemes, please refer to [3].
Another implication of this equivalence is the construction
of secure IBI schemes from secure IBE schemes.
6. EFFICIENT COP FROM GQ
The mentioned two generic constructions result in several
COP protocols based on a range of diﬀerent security assump-
tions. However, the cryptography involved in implementing
IBE and IBI schemes is complex. For instance, a notable
proportion of such schemes requires implementation of bilin-
ear maps. In this section we show that the GQ identiﬁcation
scheme [21] yields a cop-imp-ca-secure credential ownership
proof protocol (that we call RSA-COP) for the popular RSA-
FDH signature [6]. Such a construction only exploits simple
RSA cryptography and can be implemented eﬃciently. Par-
ticularly, RSA-COP can be easily integrated into credential
systems already using the popular RSA-FDH signature to
issue credentials. First we brieﬂy review the GQ scheme and
then prove that it yields a secure COP protocol. Finally, a
simple comparison is shown between RSA-COP and some
ZK solutions to our motivating problem, in terms of compu-
tational and communicational complexity. The comparison
provides clear justiﬁcation why COPs are preferable to ZK
solutions.
6.1 The GQ Identiﬁcation Scheme
This scheme was proposed by Guillou and Quisquater [21],
and proved to have both the honest veriﬁer zero knowledge
(HVZK) and the proof of knowledge (PoK) properties. The
scheme enables the prover to prove knowledge of x to the
2[3] adds an initialization oracle to the two oracles that we
have. The adversary there must ﬁrst initialize each identity,
which causes a secret key to be generated for that identity.
We do not require the adversary to initialize the creden-
tials, i.e. to cause a certain message to be signed. Instead,
the credentials are automatically initialized upon calling the
interaction oracle. The diﬀerence stems from two ways of
formalizing the same concept, and as our goal here is to show
an inherent equivalence, rather than a precisely formal one,
we do not address the diﬀerence.

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper we have introduced the concept of secure cre-
dential ownership proofs and proposed several schemes for
it. We have shown general constructions based on identity-
based encryption and identiﬁcation schemes. Plenty of se-
cure schemes for each of those schemes has been proposed
in the literature, oﬀering a wide range of options to imple-
ment secure credential ownership proofs. Furthermore, the
equality we have shown between credential ownership proofs
and identity-based identiﬁcations introduces new scheme de-
signs for the latter (and hence for identity-based signatures
through the Fiat-Shamir paradigm [18, 3]) as well. Our re-
sult on the security of the GQ protocol for proving ownership
of RSA-FDH credentials enables current credential systems
which use such signatures to integrate GQ easily with guar-
anteed security, while all the previously issued credentials
