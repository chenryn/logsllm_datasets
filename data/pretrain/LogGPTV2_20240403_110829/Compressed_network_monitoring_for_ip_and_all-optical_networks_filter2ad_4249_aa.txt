ABSTRACT
We address the problem of eﬃcient end-to-end network mon-
itoring of path metrics in communication networks. Our goal
is to minimize the number of measurements or monitors re-
quired to maintain an acceptable estimation accuracy. We
present a framework based on diﬀusion wavelets and non-
linear estimation. Our procedure involves the development
of a diﬀusion wavelet basis that is adapted to the moni-
toring problem. This basis exploits spatial and temporal
correlations in the measured phenomena to provide a com-
pressible representation of the path metrics. The framework
employs nonlinear estimation techniques using (cid:2)1 minimiza-
tion to generate estimates for the unmeasured paths. We de-
scribe heuristic approaches for the selection of the paths that
should be monitored, or equivalently, where hardware moni-
tors should be located. We demonstrate how our estimation
framework can improve the eﬃciency of end-to-end delay
estimation in IP networks and reduce the number of hard-
ware monitors required to track bit-error rates in all-optical
networks (networks with no electrical regenerators).

INTRODUCTION
Direct monitoring of a network – either at the path level
or the link level – does not scale in any practical setting. For
the past decade, researchers have been actively investigating
techniques for inferring network characteristics from incom-
plete or indirect measurements [6, 20]. This paper describes
a scheme for estimating performance metrics such as delay
or loss rates on many end-to-end paths in a network using
measurements taken on only a few of these paths. Similar to
related previous work [3, 5], we exploit the notion that the
performance on two overlapping paths should be correlated.
For example, delay statistics of two paths with at least one
link in common are correlated because packets from both
ﬂows are being delayed in a common queue. Similarly, in
all-optical networks, two lightpaths with at least one link in
common are correlated due to crosstalk across wavelengths.
For either of these examples, it is possible to predict the
performance on unmeasured paths using measurements of a
few paths and knowledge of routing and the network topol-
ogy. In this paper we also address the topic of exploiting
temporal correlation for path-level performance monitoring.
Our methodology begins with the identiﬁcation of a ba-
sis, which we design using diﬀusion wavelets, that enables us
to accurately approximate the vector of path metrics using
only a small number of non-zero coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcients
eﬃciently summarize end-to-end performance on all paths.
Diﬀusion wavelets generalize the concept of wavelets by pro-
viding a multi-scale decomposition of functions deﬁned on a
graph [7]. The diﬀusion wavelet framework is applicable to a
wide range of monitoring scenarios and allows us to simulta-
neously take advantage of spatial and temporal correlation
among the monitored paths. Posing the network monitoring
problem as a wavelet coeﬃcient estimation exercise allows us
to make use of recently-developed, powerful tools from the
theory of compressed sensing for estimating a sparse vector
using a relatively small number of measurements.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
formally deﬁnes the monitoring problem and framework in-
troduced in this paper, and provides an overview of diﬀu-
sion wavelets and nonlinear estimators from the theory of
compressed sensing. Section 3 describes how we use diﬀu-
sion wavelets to construct compressible representations of
the path metric functions. Section 4 discusses heuristics
for selecting the paths to monitor and deciding where to
place monitoring devices. Section 5 and Section 6 provide
case studies of the application of our monitoring and esti-
mation framework. The estimation of mean end-to-end In-
ternet queuing delays is explored in Section 5, and Section 6
focuses on monitoring bit-error rate in all-optical networks.
Section 7 provides concluding remarks and indicates avenues
of future research.
2. COMPRESSED NETWORK
MONITORING FRAMEWORK
2.1 Problem Formulation and Notation
Our goal in this paper is to accurately monitor perfor-
mance metrics (e.g., end-to-end delays in an IP network or
bit-error rates in an all-optical network) on a collection of np
end-to-end paths using measurements on a subset of these
paths. The size of the subset, ns  0 if and only if there is a link between
nodes i and j. The magnitude of Di,j models the strength
of the correlation or similarity between the function values
at nodes i and j. Much like traditional wavelets, diﬀusion
wavelets recursively split the space over which the signal
is observed into smaller, orthogonal subspaces. Consider a
function f ∈ R
n deﬁned on a network of n nodes, where fi
corresponds to the value at node i; the function is initially
n. At scale j = 1, . . . , L, for
deﬁned on the space V0 = R
some pre-speciﬁed depth L, the diﬀusion wavelet construc-
tion recursively splits the space Vj into a scaling subspace,
Vj+1, and a wavelet subspace, Wj+1, by analyzing eigen-
vectors of the jth dyadic power of the diﬀusion operator,
D2j . The matrix D2j is, intuitively, related to averaging
or smoothing over neighborhoods of radius 2j hops in the
original graph, and the study of eigenvectors of this matrix
is analogous to Fourier spectral analysis on a regular space.
The ensuing orthonormal wavelet basis, adapted to the rep-
resentation of the data (function values) over the graph, is
obtained by concatenating bases for VL and the wavelet sub-
spaces, {Wj}L
j=1. We refer the reader to [7] for the precise
details of the construction.
Let Bj ∈ R
n, j = 1, . . . , n, denote the ﬁnal collection of
orthonormal wavelet basis vectors. A function on the graph
can be represented as a vector y ∈ R
n, where yi is the value
at the ith node, and the wavelet decomposition of y is given
j=1 βjBj , where βj = yT Bj is the jth wavelet
by y =
coeﬃcient. Stacking the coeﬃcients, βj , into a vector, β,
and concatenating the basis vectors, {Bj} into an n × n
matrix, B, we can write y = Bβ. In the following sections
we propose diﬀusion operators D designed such that the
corresponding wavelet representation of a path performance
vector, y, is highly compressed; i.e., most of the energy in
y can be captured in a few βj. To be more precise, let
us rearrange the wavelet coeﬃcients in order of decreasing
magnitude so that
Pn
Pm
|β(1)| ≥ |β(2)| ≥ ··· ≥ |β(n)|,
by(m) =
when the approximation error (cid:6)y−by(m)(cid:6) decays rapidly as a
and deﬁne the best m-term approximation of y in B to be
j=1 β(j)B(j). We say that y is compressible in B
function of m, meaning that y is eﬃciently represented using
only a few basis vectors, B(1), . . . , B(m). In this case, we only
really need to estimate values of the few large coeﬃcients in
order to obtain a high quality estimate of end-to-end per-
formance on many paths. Moreover, in this setting we can
make use of recent breakthroughs in the area of nonlinear
estimation of compressible functions to quantify the num-
ber of paths that need to be measured to obtain estimates
of performance at a speciﬁed level of accuracy.
2.3 Estimation of Compressible Signals
Now, suppose we have made observations ys of the end-to-
end performance for a subset of the paths we are interested
in, and we wish to estimate y. We have ys = Ay, where A is
the selection matrix, indicating which paths we observe di-
rectly. In the following sections we describe diﬀusion wavelet
bases B which eﬃciently compress the vector of end-to-end
path metrics. We can express y in terms of its wavelet coef-
ﬁcients as y = Bβ, where most of the energy in y is captured
in a few entries of β. Combining this expression with the
expression for ys above leads to ys = ABβ. This begs the
question: can we accurately recover the vector of coeﬃcients,
β, from measurements ys? In particular, we would like to
take advantage of the fact that β only has a few large entries,
and most are very small in magnitude or even zero.
A straightforward approach to obtaining a sparse estimate
of β is to solve an (cid:2)0 optimization of the form:
(cid:6)β(cid:6)0 subject to ys = ABβ,
bβ = arg min
β
where (cid:6)β(cid:6)0 counts the number of non-zero entries of β. It is
well known that this problem is NP-hard, requiring one to
enumerate all possible subsets of non-zero coeﬃcients.
It has recently been shown that the solution to a simpler
(cid:2)1 optimization problem,
bβ = arg min
(cid:6)β(cid:6)1 subject to ys = ABβ,
β
Pn
is equivalent to the (cid:2)0 problem if certain conditions on A, B,
and β are satisﬁed [2, 11, 14]. Here, (cid:6)β(cid:6)1 =
i=1 |βi|. Be-
cause the (cid:2)1 optimization (1) is convex, it is computationally
tractable, and a solution can be obtained using linear pro-
gramming.

3. COMPRESSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS
In order to construct a compressible representation, we
develop a diﬀusion wavelet basis where the diﬀusion oper-
ator is related to the anticipated correlation between path
metrics. We ﬁrst deﬁne the graph of interest G = (V, E ).
We are measuring a performance metric function deﬁned on
the physical paths of the network. Accordingly, the vertex
set V for our diﬀusion wavelet basis has one vertex for each
path at each timestep, V (k) = {v(k)
i=1, over the estimation
interval k = 1, . . . , τ .
3.1 Single Timestep: Spatial Diffusion
i }np
First consider the case where τ = 1, that is, ns routes
are observed during one timestep k and we want to recover
the metrics of the non-observed routes immediately. Let
G(k) = (V (k),E (k)) be the undirected graph over which we
apply the diﬀusion wavelet framework. Notice that, in this
work, the terms “vertex” and “edge” refer exclusively to the
graph G(k) deﬁned in this section, while the terms “node”,
“link”, and “path” refer to the physical nodes (e.g., routers),
links and paths of the network; therefore, we can refer to
“edges” between “paths”. The graph G(k) is deﬁned as fol-
lows. The vertices V (k) of G(k) correspond to the paths of the
network of interest, and there is an edge between the vertices
vi and vj if and only if paths i and j share at least one link.
Therefore, vertices of the graph are neighbors when their
corresponding paths share a link. The function to be stud-
ied over G is the set of metrics associated with the vertices
(paths).
We assign a weight wi,j to the edge between the vertices
vi and vj to model the correlation between path metrics on
routes that share the same links. The choice of these weights
is problem-dependent and is determined by the anticipated
relationship between link and path metrics.
It eﬀectively
forms an a priori model for the correlation structure in the
estimation problem.
For concreteness, we outline a methodology for choosing
weights that is appropriate when there is an approximately
linear relationship between path and link metrics. In this
setting, it is reasonable to choose a weight that is propor-
tional to the fraction of shared links in the two paths. Con-
sider two paths i and j, and denote by Ri the set of links
used by path i. We deﬁne the weight wi,j associated with
the edge between vi and vj as:
wi,j =
|Ri ∩ Rj|
|Ri ∪ Rj| .
(2)
More weight is given to edges between paths that share many
links, thereby emphasizing the spatial correlation intrinsic
to end-to-end performance metrics — these edges are thus
“spatial correlation edges”, as opposed to the “time correla-
tion edges”, deﬁned next.
The diﬀusion wavelet procedure in [7] requires a diﬀu-
sion operator D(k) to generate a wavelet representation over
G(k). To obtain a diﬀusion operator from the construction
described above, we apply Sinkhorn balancing [18] to the
matrix of weights, [w], to form a doubly stochastic matrix,
D.
3.2 Multiple Timesteps: Incorporating Time
Diffusion
When metrics change slowly with time, relative to the
sampling rate, as is the case with mean end-to-end delays
or BERs on lightpaths, time-correlation between the sam-
ples can be exploited to improve estimation accuracy. We
account for time correlation in the diﬀusion operator as fol-
