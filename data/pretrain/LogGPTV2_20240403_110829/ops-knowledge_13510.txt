User: How to use Grafana to display server performance data
Assistant: The following are the general steps for using Grafana to display server performance data: 1. Install and set up data sources: Add data sources in Grafana and configure them as server performance monitoring tools, such as Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite, etc. Configure the connection information (such as API key, domain name, port, etc.) with the server monitoring tool in the data source, and test the connection. 2. Create a monitoring panel: Create a panel in Grafana, set the title, background and data source and other information. Panels have elements such as graphs, tables, text, etc. that can be custom placed and designed. 3. Add Data Source: Select the server metrics to display and add them to the panel data source. After selecting an indicator, you may need to select the format and time range of the indicator, and customize the threshold (for example, the CPU utilization is greater than 80%). 4. Design and edit panels: add graphics, tables and other elements to Grafana, and define their layout and style. Add a data source to the element and set visualization properties such as title, axis, color, etc. In Grafana, you can also add text boxes, comments, and alert rules to better explain and monitor server performance data. 5. Publishing panels: Finally, methods such as Kibana, Prometheus dashboards, URL embedding, etc. can publish panels to internal or external integration systems with secure authentication.
