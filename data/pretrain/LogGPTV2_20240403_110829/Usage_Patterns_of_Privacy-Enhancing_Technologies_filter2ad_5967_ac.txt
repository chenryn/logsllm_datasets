### Identifier and Database Remodeling
Other application building tools offer the capability to remodel existing databases, using arbitrary keys to link different tables of information instead of unique identifiers. Using unique person identification for customers often raises privacy concerns, especially if any transaction data is shared outside the service's scope.

### Anonymizer Products and Services
Providing anonymous access is a core functionality of early privacy-enhancing products and services. Primarily available on the Internet, these services allow individuals to send messages and interact with electronic services without revealing their true identity. The translation between false and true identities is typically managed by a chain of cooperating trusted parties, protected by encryption mechanisms. This ensures that anonymity is maintained even if one of the trusted parties' translation tables is compromised.

### Encryption Tools
Encryption techniques are often central to privacy-enhancing solutions. They ensure the confidentiality of sensitive transaction data as it passes through insecure networks and servers, or they can hide identities from other parties. Multiple encryptions can be combined to protect data even if one or more keys are exposed. Although encryption has been used long before todayâ€™s privacy issues, it is generally considered a privacy-enhancing technology by many.

### Filters and Blockers
This category of tools focuses on mitigating the negative effects of privacy loss. By deleting or blocking (filtering) unwanted messages, such as email, web content, or other targeted electronic media, these tools aim to protect individuals from unsolicited messages (spam). Most people do not consider these tools Privacy Enhancing Technologies because they only address secondary effects.

### Track and Evidence Erasers
When communicating or using services via the Internet, public telephony network, or other electronic media, users leave traces of their activity in various places along the data route. Some traces are necessary for administrative purposes (e.g., billing or traffic planning), while others are for user or network provider convenience. Various utilities are available to erase history logs and traces. While these utilities are not typically considered Privacy Enhancing Technologies, they can be part of a broader framework supporting privacy.

### 4.2 Privacy Management
The second category, Privacy Management, includes tools and technologies that support the administration of privacy rules rather than processing the information itself. This category is divided into two subclasses:

#### Informational Tools
Raising awareness, creating policies, and checking compliance are not active Privacy Enhancing Technologies but are often integral parts of a PET framework. Privacy-protecting initiatives require structured policies and principles during planning, implementation, and operational phases. Regular audits or reviews document compliance. Several tools facilitate the creation and management of privacy policies and verify that services, such as websites, comply with set rules.

#### Administrative Tools
Both general and specific tools support enterprise management of privacy. General tools overlap significantly with other security functions, making privacy management an integral part of enterprise security. Specific tools for managing privacy issues are offered as add-on modules to general system management suites. These modules are considered Privacy Enhancing Technologies by some interviewees.

### 5 Technology Features Overview
Most Privacy Enhancing Technologies aim to achieve one or more of the following three main privacy features:
1. **Unobservability**: Making private information invisible or unavailable to others.
2. **Unlinkability**: Preventing others from linking different pieces of observed information together.
3. **Anonymity**: Preventing others from connecting observed information with a specific person.

In addition to these primary features, some tools focus on eliminating negative effects of privacy loss, such as unsolicited messages (spam), unwanted web content (popup windows), or unauthorized programs (spyware, viruses). Such tools are considered secondary and marked with an "S". Another category of Privacy Tools helps users understand privacy issues and make informed decisions, marked with an "I".

### 5.1 CRM Personalization
Several tools preserve the anonymity of users of internet-based shopping and other services, some integrated into Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions. In its simplest form, CRM personalization tools enable internet transactions between a shop and anonymous customers. More sophisticated solutions support profiling individual customers without knowing or storing their identity, supporting the unlinkability aspect of privacy.

### 5.2 Application Data Management
Many applications use a common, connecting key field, often a unique person identifier (e.g., CPR-number in Denmark). This design can make it difficult to import and export data without compromising privacy. Replacing the common personal identifier with multiple key fields that link tables without referencing personal identity can enable interoperability and data export without revealing personal identifiers, supporting the unlinkability aspect of privacy.

### 5.3 Browsing Pseudonyms
When browsing the Internet, users leave traces at every communication point. No single authority controls these traces, and users cannot "switch off" the traces because the Internet routing mechanisms depend on them. However, some services offer users a false address (pseudonym) to visit sites without revealing their real address, supporting the anonymity aspect of privacy.

### 5.4 Virtual Email Addresses
Similar to browsing, sending an email leaves traces at many active nodes, and copies of the email may be kept. To send anonymous emails, both the sending address and technical transmission data must be fictitious. Some services offer a false email address (pseudonym) with varying degrees of anonymity, allowing users to communicate without revealing their real identity, supporting the anonymity aspect of privacy.

### 5.5 Trusted Third Parties
Using a Trusted Third Party (TTP) for delivering certificates and keys in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) services is widely implemented. Examples include Registration Authorities (RAs), Certification Authorities (CAs), validation or time-stamping authorities, notarization, notification, anonymization, and pseudonymisation. TTPs can support both the unlinkability and anonymity aspects of privacy.

### 5.6 Surrogate Keys
Techniques exist to replace key fields in Data Warehouse input tables with calculated (surrogate) keys. These tools are typically used for customer transaction data to reduce the computing power required to align incoming data with existing databases. They can also prevent data from different Data Warehouse tables from being recombined, supporting the unlinkability aspect of privacy.

### 5.7 Encrypting Email
Emails can be observed by other parties during transport over the Internet, and nodes may keep copies. To protect the content, the email body and attachments can be encrypted using built-in email client functionality or third-party tools. While this does not hide the message's existence, it prevents the exposure of sensitive content, supporting the unobservability aspect of privacy.

### 5.8 Encrypting Transactions
When browsing the Internet, a "secure" protocol like SSL can be used instead of HTTP. SSL encrypts transaction content and can authenticate transaction parties. This technology is often used for transactions involving sensitive personal or financial information, supporting the unobservability aspect of privacy.

### 5.9 Encrypting Documents
Storing or transmitting electronic documents with person-related information requires ensuring their integrity and confidentiality. Document encryption protects against unauthorized exposure, copying, or alteration, especially in infrastructures that cannot guarantee information protection, supporting the unobservability aspect of privacy.

### 5.10 Filtering Email Spam
Numerous utilities and services protect users and organizations from unsolicited email messages (spam). These services use technologies like scanning mail contents and address fields for known spam patterns, consulting central databases for identifying spammers, or allowing only pre-authorized emails to pass. However, since common email protocols do not support reliable sender identification, these methods are not very effective. Filtering email spam addresses only the secondary effects of privacy loss.
