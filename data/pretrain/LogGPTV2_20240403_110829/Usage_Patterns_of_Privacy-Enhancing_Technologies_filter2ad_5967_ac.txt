identifier.  Other  application  building  tools  offer  the  ability  to  remodel  existing  databases, 
using  arbitrary  keys  to  link  different  tables  of  information,  instead  of  unique  identifiers. 
Using unique person identification of customers is often a privacy issue, especially if any of 
the transaction data is shared outside the scope of the service. 
Anonymizer Products and Services 
Providing anonymous access is the original core functionality of the first privacy enhancing 
products and services. Primarily offered on the Internet, the services allow persons to send 
messages  and  interact  with  electronic  services  without  revealing  their  true  identity.  The 
translation  between  the  false  and  true  identities  is  typically  performed  by  a  chain  of 
cooperating trusted parties, and protected with encryption mechanisms, so the anonymity is 
maintained, even if the translation tables of one of the trusted parties is compromised. 
Encryption Tools 
Using encryption techniques to ensure secrecy of selected information is often a central part 
of privacy enhancing solutions. Using encryption technology, sensitive transaction data can 
pass through insecure networks and servers, or identities can be hidden from other parties. As 
mentioned above, multiple encryptions can be combined, so the data is protected even if one 
or  more  of  the  keys  are  exposed.  Although  encryption  techniques  were  invented  and  used 
long  before  today’s  privacy  issues  were  recognized,  encryption  is  generally  considered  a 
privacy enhancing technology by our respondents. 
Filters and Blockers 
This is a category of tools, focused on eliminating the negative effects of the loss of privacy. 
By deleting or blocking (filtering) unwanted messages, arriving as email, web-content or via 
other  targeted  electronic  media,  the  filtering  tools  aim  to  protect  the  targeted  individual 
against  unsolicited  messages  (spam)  of  all  kinds.  Most  people  don’t  consider  these  tools 
Privacy Enhancing Technologies, because they are handling the secondary effects only.

Track and evidence erasers  
When  communicating  or  using  services  offered  through  the  Internet,  the  public  telephony 
network or other electronic media, the user will leave traces of his activity in many places 
along  the  route  of  the  data  traffic.  Some  of  these  traces  are  required  for  administrative 
purposes (e.g. billing or traffic planning) while others are intended for the convenience of the 
user or the network provider. Both for the network and for the user equipment, a number of 
utilities  are  offered  to  erase  history  logs  and  traces.  These  utilities  are  generally  not 
considered Privacy Enhancing technologies, but they can be part of a framework of products 
and services that support privacy. 
4.2  PRIVACY MANAGEMENT 
The second category, Privacy Management, contains tools and technologies that support the 
administration of privacy rules, rather than processing the information itself. This category is 
divided into the following two subclasses: 
Informational tools 
Raising  awareness,  creating  policies  and  checking  compliance  are  not  active  Privacy 
Enhancing  Technologies,  but  they  are  often  considered  natural  parts  of  a  PET  framework: 
Privacy protecting initiatives require structured policies and principles, both in the planning 
and implementation phase, and in the operational phase, where regular audits or reviews will 
document  the  compliance.  A  number  of  tools  are  offered  to  facilitate  creation  and 
management of privacy policies, and to verify that services, such as web sites comply with 
the set rules. 
Administrative Tools 
Both general and specific tools support Enterprise management of privacy. The general tools 
have a considerable functional overlap with other security functions, i.e. the management of 
privacy is an integral part of the enterprise security management. Specific tools for managing 
privacy issues  are offered as add-on modules to  general system management suites. These 
modules are considered Privacy Enhancing Technologies by some interviewees.

5  TECHNOLOGY FEATURES OVERVIEW 
The purpose of most Privacy Enhancing Technologies is to obtain one or more of the three 
main privacy features: 
1.  Unobservability – making private information invisible or unavailable to others 
2.  Unlinkability – preventing others from linking different pieces of observed 
information together  
person 
3.  Anonymity – preventing others from connecting observed information with a specific 
In addition to these primary features, some tools are focused on eliminating various negative 
effects  of  loosing  privacy,  such  as  unsolicited  messages  (spam),  unwanted  web  content 
(popup windows) or even unauthorized programs (spyware, virus). We consider such tools 
secondary, and mark them with an S. 
Another category of Privacy Tools is aimed at helping the user understand privacy issues and 
take privacy decisions on a well-informed basis. Such tools considered informational, they 
are marked with I in the table.

5.1  CRM PERSONALIZATION 
A number of tools are offered to preserve the anonymity of users of Internet based shopping 
and other services, some of these tools constitute an integrated part of Customer Relationship 
Management solutions. In it’s simplest form, the CRM personalization tools enable Internet 
transactions  between  a  shop  and  anonymous  customers  –  more  sophisticated  solutions 
support  profiling  of  individual  customers  without  knowing  or  even  storing  their  identity. 
CRM personalization is supporting the unlinkability aspect of privacy. 
5.2  APPLICATION DATA MANAGEMENT 
Many applications are built on a number of databases with a common, connecting key field, 
consisting  of  a  unique  person  identifier  (in  Denmark:  CPR-number).  This  design  principle 
can  make  it  very  difficult  to  import  and  export  data  without  compromising  the  privacy, 
because the identity of the person must follow the data to ensure consistency. In such cases, 
the common personal identifier can be replaced with several different key fields that link the 
tables  without  referencing  the  personal  identity.  Some  tools  are  offered  to  replace  the  key 
field contents with random identifiers, and thereby enabling interoperability,  and export of 
data, without revealing the personal identifiers. In this way, application data management is 
supporting the unlinkability aspect of privacy. 
5.3  BROWSING PSEUDONYMS 
When browsing the Internet, the user leaves traces in every place, where the traffic crosses 
communication equipment, servers and other active nodes. No single authority is in control of 
these  traces,  and  the  user  cannot  “switch  off”  the  traces,  because  the  Internet  routing 
mechanisms are depending on the trace to deliver responses back to the user. However, some 
services are offering the user a false address (pseudonym), so the user can visit sites without 
revealing  his  own  address.  Browsing  Pseudonyms  is  supporting  the  anonymity  aspect  of 
privacy. 
5.4  VIRTUAL EMAIL ADDRESSES 
Similar to when browsing the internet, the user leaves traffic traces in  many  active nodes, 
when an email is sent, and the possibility exist, that one or more of the nodes can keep a copy 
of  the  email,  after  it  has  been  forwarded.  In  order  to  send  anonymous  email,  not  only  the 
sending email address must be changed, also a number of technical transmission data must be 
fictitious. Some services are offering the use of a false email address (pseudonym) along with 
different degrees of anonymity, so the user can communicate via email without revealing his 
real identity. Virtual email addresses are supporting the anonymity aspect of privacy. 
5.5  TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES 
Using  a  Trusted  Third  Party  (TTP)  for  delivering  certificates  and  keys  in  a  Public  Key 
Infrastructure (PKI) services is already widely implemented. Registration Authorities (RAs), 
Certification  Authorities  (CAs),  validation  or  time-stamping  authorities,  notarization, 
notification, anonymization and pseudonymisation are all examples of TTP services. Trusted 
third  parties  can  be  supporting  both  the  unlinkability  aspect  and  the  anonymity  aspect  of 
privacy.

5.6  SURROGATE KEYS 
Similar  to  the  tools  mentioned  in  section  5.2,  a number  of  techniques  exist  to  replace  key 
fields in Data Warehouse input tables with calculated (surrogate) keys. The tools are typically 
used  on  data  describing  customer  transactions,  and  the  purpose  is  mainly  to  reduce  the 
computing  power  required  to  align  the  incoming  data  with  already  existing  databases. 
However,  the  same  techniques  can  also  prevent  that  data  from  different  Data  Warehouse 
tables  can  be  recombined,  and  hence  be  considered  a  privacy  enhancing  technology.  Used 
this way, a surrogate key is a technology supporting the unlinkability aspect of privacy. 
5.7  ENCRYPTING EMAIL 
As  mentioned  in  section  5.4,  the  possibility  exists,  that  the  contents  of  an  email  can  be 
observed by other parties, while the message is transported over the Internet, and one or more 
of the nodes can keep a copy of the email, after it has been forwarded. To protect the content 
against being exposed, the email body and/or its attachments can be encrypted, using built-in 
functionality in the email client or third party tools. Although this does not hide the existence 
of the message, encryption can prevent the exposure of sensitive email content. Encryption is 
a technology supporting the unobservability aspect of privacy. 
5.8  ENCRYPTING TRANSACTIONS 
When  browsing  the  Internet,  a  “secure”  protocol  can  be  used,  as  an  alternative  to  the 
traditional  hypertext  transfer  protocol,  HTTP.  The  most  common  secure  protocol,  SSL, 
includes encryption of the transaction content, and can also be used for authentication of the 
transaction parties. This technology is often used for transactions involving sensitive personal 
or financial information. Similar protocols are used in ATMs and Point of Sale terminals, to 
protect  the  information  exchanged  with  the  bank  or  clearing  house.  Encryption  is  a 
technology supporting the unobservability aspect of privacy. 
5.9  ENCRYPTING DOCUMENTS 
When  storing  or  transmitting  electronic  documents  with  person-related  information,  an 
important  issue  is  to  assure  the  integrity  and  confidentiality  of  the  document,  or  in  other 
words: How to protect the document against unauthorized exposure, copying or alteration. 
Document encryption is often used to protect privacy, especially when the document is stored 
or  transmitted  in  an  infrastructure  that  cannot  guarantee  the  protection  of  the  information. 
Encryption is a technology supporting the unobservability aspect of privacy. 
5.10  FILTERING EMAIL SPAM 
A large number of utilities and services are offered to protect users and organizations against 
unsolicited  email  messages  (spam).  These  services  are  using  several  technologies,  such  as 
scanning  the  mail  contents  and  address  fields  for  known  spam  patterns,  consulting  central 
databases  for  identifying  known  spammers,  or  allowing  only  emails  from  pre-authorized 
users  to  cross  the  filter.  However,  since  today’s  common  email  protocols  do  not  support 
reliable identification of the sender, such methods are not very effective. Filtering email spam 
is only addressing the secondary effects of loss of privacy.
