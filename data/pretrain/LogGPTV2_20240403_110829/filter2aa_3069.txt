## Introduction to WingOS

### Overview
- **WingOS** is an embedded Linux operating system with proprietary modifications in the kernel.
- Originally created by Motorola, it is now owned by Extreme Networks.
- The architecture is MIPS N32.
- It is primarily used in wireless access points (APs) and controllers.
- There is no publicly available information or prior research on its internal workings.

### User Interfaces
- **Web Interface**
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**

### Devices Using WingOS
- **Extreme Networks Devices:**
  - Motorola devices
  - Zebra devices
- **Kontron Devices for Aircrafts:**
  - Widely used in aircraft by many airlines around the world.

### Applications
- Smart buildings and smart cities
- Healthcare
- Government
- Small and large enterprise networks
- Education
- Retail and stadiums

## Scenarios & Attack Surface

### 1. Aircraft Scenario
- **Focus:** Remote pre-auth vulnerabilities
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - **Ethernet Cable:**
    - Less likely in an aircraft.
    - UDP Services/ Mint Services
  - **Wi-Fi (open Wi-Fi or password-protected Wi-Fi)**
  - **Pivoting from Sat modem to AP (From the ground!)**

### 2. Other Scenarios
- **Focus:** Remote pre-auth vulnerabilities
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - **Connect Ethernet Cable Directly:**
    - More likely with outdoor Access Points but also possible inside buildings.
  - **Wi-Fi (open Wi-Fi or password-protected Wi-Fi)**
  - **Internal Network (you are inside the network)**

## Vulnerabilities

### Hidden Root Shell Backdoor
- **Description:**
  - Allows transition from a restricted CLI to a hidden root shell.
  - From an attacker's perspective, CLI access is good, but a root shell means complete compromise.
  - Not a critical vulnerability but very important for the research process.
- **Details:**
  - Default value in every WingOS.
  - Content of the file is passed to a loop.
  - Emulated with Unicorn, which uses Qemu to emulate assembly code for several architectures.
  - The content of the file consists of hex bytes (in ASCII).
  - Decrypted (RC4) with the key "Hi Sabeena? How’re you doin’? Bye!!" resulting in the string "password".
  - MAC address of the device is manipulated and used as a key for further decryption.
  - Ensures the valid password contains only lowercase letters.
  - Generates a different password each time.

### Remote Pre-Auth Stack Overflow
- **Description:**
  - A UDP service listening on 0.0.0.0 by default.
  - Affects the Radio Interface Module (RIM) process.
- **Details:**
  - Only some old versions are vulnerable to this stack overflow.
  - Kontron devices (aircrafts) firmware should be vulnerable based on their website information.

### Remote Pre-Auth "Global" Denial of Service
- **Description:**
  - Newest firmware version has fixed the stack overflow, but...
  - Executing the same Proof of Concept (PoC) 2-3 times can kill the RIM process multiple times, causing the whole OS to reboot.
  - Watchdog checks if the RIM process is running; if not, the OS reboots.

### Mint Vulnerabilities
- **Description:**
  - L2/L3 proprietary protocol.
  - Proprietary socket address family (AF_MINT).
  - Datagram socket.
- **Attack Scenarios:**
  - Attacker connects to the network or directly to the target device (Wireless or Cable).
  - Attacker remotely compromises a device connected to the network.
  - Attacks services/AP/Controllers over Mint services.
  - Controllers act like Windows Domain Controllers.
- **Creating Mint Client:**
  - Inspecting the library `usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_socket.so` allows importing socket and creating Mint sockets.
- **Vulnerability:**
  - Memcpy’s source and length are user-controlled, and the destination is on the heap.
  - HSD process, Mint port 14.
  - Requires adding a fake MAC to the authenticated list.
  - Crashes and backtraces provided.

### Aeroscout Vulnerability
- **Description:**
  - UDP port 1144.
  - No authentication at all.
  - Once the protocol is reverse-engineered, one can manipulate locations.

## Exploitation & Demo

### Steps:
1. Use your own device (or a compromised one).
2. Add a fake MAC address to the auth list.
3. Overflow the heap with ROP gadgets and shellcode.
4. Cause a stack overflow with the heap data.
5. Execute the exploit.

### Exploit Details:
- **Environment:**
  - No ASLR, NX, or stack canaries.
  - Cache incoherence problem: MIPS CPU I-Cache D-Cache Instructions, Data.
  - Payload likely stored in the D-Cache.
- **Solution:**
  - Fill the D-Cache to flush it.
  - Call a blocking function such as `Sleep()` using ROP.
  - Use ROP and shellcode to achieve the desired effect.

### Shellcode
- **MIPS N32 Shellcode:**
  - Specific shellcode for the MIPS N32 architecture.

## Conclusions

- **Patches Provided by Extreme Networks:**
  - [Vulnerability Notice VN-2018-003](https://gtacknowledge.extremenetworks.com/articles/Vulnerability_Notice/VN-2018-003)
- **Room for Improvement:**
  - There is significant room for improvement in WingOS.
  - More vulnerabilities may exist in the OS.
  - Hopefully, these lessons learned will lead to proactive fixes.
