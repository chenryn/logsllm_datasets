### Describe the issue:
Release notes document MD5 checksums for universal2 wheels. However, I can't
seem to find one.
Any attempt to `python3 -m pip install numpy --target foo
--platform=universal2` results in building from source (asks to add `--no-
deps`), which subsequently fails.
What would be the best way to install universal2 (e.g. arm64+x86_64)
distribution of numpy?
### Reproduce the code example:
    n/a
### Error message:
    : error: no such file or directory: 'build/temp.macosx-10.9-universal2-3.9/numpy/core/src/multiarray/dragon4.o'
