When I put Atom in my Apple Dock and clicked on the icon Atom started
successfully but couldn't find needed programs in my PATH. I've spent sometime
finding a possible solution.
  1. Instead of having a binary in the Atom.app/Contents/MacOS use your script Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh.
  2. The script needs 2 changes: 
    * change for the new location of the binary
    * change the first line of the script from:  
#!/usr/bin/env bash  
to:  
#!/usr/bin/env bash -l
This seems to start Atom from a bash shell that runs the ~/.profile script
first allowing all of the environment variables to get set and made visible to
Atom.
OS X still does not have shared global environment variables. But it does help
establish the login environment variables for atom including PATH.
I've made a new application just for your script as my current work around.
Thanks,
