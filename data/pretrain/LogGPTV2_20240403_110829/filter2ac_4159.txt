### Title: BlackHat EU-18: Malware Buried Deep in SPI Flashâ€”Sednit's First UEFI Rootkit Discovered in the Wild

#### Abstract:
In recent years, BIOS rootkits have been a subject of extensive research and discussion. However, concrete evidence of real-world campaigns targeting this level of system compromise has been limited. Our presentation will unveil a successful campaign executed by the Sednit group, also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, and APT28. This Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group is notorious for high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) email leak.

Earlier this year, a public report revealed that the Sednit group had successfully trojanized a userland LoJack agent and deployed it against their targets. LoJack, an embedded anti-theft application, has been scrutinized by security researchers due to its unique persistence method: a module preinstalled in many computers' UEFI/BIOS software. While several security risks have been identified in LoJack over the years, no significant in-the-wild activity was reported until the discovery of the Sednit group exploiting vulnerabilities in the userland agent.

Our research, however, reveals that the Sednit group did not stop there. They also managed to install a custom UEFI module directly into the target systems' SPI flash memory. In this talk, we will provide a detailed overview of the full infection chain, demonstrating how Sednit was able to deploy their custom UEFI module on key targets' computers. Additionally, we will offer an in-depth analysis of both the UEFI module and the associated trojanized LoJack agent.

#### Key Points:
1. **Introduction to BIOS Rootkits**: Overview of the significance and challenges of BIOS rootkits.
2. **The Sednit Group**: Background and notable attacks, including the 2016 DNC email leak.
3. **Trojanized LoJack Agent**: Detailed explanation of how the Sednit group exploited the LoJack agent.
4. **Custom UEFI Module**: Step-by-step analysis of the infection chain and the installation of the UEFI module in SPI flash memory.
5. **In-Depth Analysis**: Comprehensive examination of the UEFI module and the trojanized LoJack agent, including technical details and implications.

This talk aims to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the Sednit group's sophisticated tactics and the potential threats posed by UEFI rootkits in the wild.
