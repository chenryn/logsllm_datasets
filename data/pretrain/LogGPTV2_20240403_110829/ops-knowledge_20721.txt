Question: A development team is working on a web application. During a security review, they discover that the application only relies on client-side checks to verify if a user is logged in before allowing access to restricted areas. The team is considering several strategies to enhance the security of the application's authentication process. Which of the following strategies would effectively mitigate the risk of improper authentication, according to best practices in secure application design?
"A": "Implement server-side validation of the user's session token to ensure it is valid and has not been tampered with.",
"B": "Use a CAPTCHA on the login page to prevent automated brute force attacks.",
"C": "Restrict the number of login attempts to prevent attackers from guessing passwords.",
"D": "Store user credentials in encrypted cookies to prevent attackers from reading them."
