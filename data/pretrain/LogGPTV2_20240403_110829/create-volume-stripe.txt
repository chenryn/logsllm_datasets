### Create a Striped Volume

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
This command creates a striped volume using two or more specified dynamic disks. After the volume is created, the focus automatically shifts to the new volume.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
create volume stripe [size=<size>] disk=<disk1>,<disk2>,[...<diskN>] [align=<alignment>] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **size=<size>**: Specifies the amount of disk space, in megabytes (MB), that the volume will occupy on each disk. If no size is specified, the new volume will take up the remaining free space on the smallest disk and an equal amount of space on each subsequent disk.
  
- **disk=<disk1>,<disk2>,[...<diskN>]**: Specifies the dynamic disks on which the striped volume will be created. At least two dynamic disks are required to create a striped volume. The specified amount of space (as defined by `size=`) will be allocated on each disk.

- **align=<alignment>**: Aligns all volume extents to the closest alignment boundary. This parameter is typically used with hardware RAID Logical Unit Number (LUN) arrays to improve performance. `<alignment>` is the number of kilobytes (KB) from the beginning of the disk to the closest alignment boundary.

- **noerr**: For scripting purposes only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart will continue to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**

To create a striped volume of 1000 MB in size on disks 1 and 2, use the following command:
```plaintext
create volume stripe size=1000 disk=1,2
```

**Notes:**
- Ensure that the disks you specify are dynamic and have sufficient free space.
- Striped volumes can provide improved read and write performance but do not offer fault tolerance.
