Relating to #875, willing to try a PR if offered guidance.
We're building a ecommerce store from scratch with next and are close to
finishing the initial architecture. The only thing bugging us is the number of
folders we ended up with. The `src` folder would be a major improvement in our
structure and the way we thought it could be done is by adding a property
called `pagesDir` in the `next.config.js` configuration.
With this new options set to something like:
    {
       "pagesDir": './src/pages'
    }
we could keep all the source code in src, including the pages.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Added description at the top of the page
## Current Behavior
Pages cannot be placed within a sub folder.
