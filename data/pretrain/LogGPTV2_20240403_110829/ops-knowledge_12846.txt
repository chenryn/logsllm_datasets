Assistant: In order to set up an automatic backup strategy to protect application data, the following steps can be followed: 1. Choose an appropriate AWS storage solution: AWS provides a variety of storage services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS. 2. Determine the backup frequency and retention period: According to the company's needs and budget, determine the backup frequency and retention period to ensure that data can always be restored to the required point in time. 3. Set an automatic backup policy: Set an automatic backup policy based on the selected AWS storage solution, backup frequency and retention period. For example, if you use an Amazon RDS database, you can set up automatic backups and transaction log backups. 4. Test the backup and recovery process: regularly test the backup and recovery process to ensure that the backup and recovery process is performed correctly. It is possible to create a test environment, restore backup data and verify that the application is working correctly. 5. Monitor backup status and health: Regularly monitor backup status and health to ensure backup strategies are working properly when necessary. Finally, backup strategies should align with AWS best security practices and compliance requirements.
