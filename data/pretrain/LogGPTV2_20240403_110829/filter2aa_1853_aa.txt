## Introduction
**I am a Legend** is a presentation by Celine and Elie Bursztein, delivered at Defcon 2014. The presentation explores the complexities and exploitable biases in the digital collectible card game **Hearthstone**, released by Blizzard in 2014 and based on the World of Warcraft universe.

Sometimes, overly interesting features can lead to unintended consequences. This presentation delves into how the game's complexity generates these biases.

## Outline
1. Finding undervalued cards
2. Predicting opponent deck
3. Predicting the game outcome
4. Incoming alien invasion (or not)

## Game Elements
- **Heroes**: Each player has a hero with health points.
- **Deck**: A collection of 30 cards.
- **Hand**: Cards currently available to play.
- **Mana Pool**: Resource used to play cards.
- **Weapon**: Special items that heroes can equip.
- **Minions**: Characters that can be summoned to the battlefield.
- **Card Attributes**: Mana cost, attack, health, and special abilities.

**Special Abilities**: These make the game complex and interesting.

## Finding Undervalued Cards
### Model Assumptions
1. Mana cost is proportional to card power.
2. The power of cards roughly increases linearly.
3. Card effects have a constant price.
4. A card has an intrinsic value.
5. The value of the card is the sum of its attributes.

### Equation
\[ \text{Value} = \text{Mana} + \text{Attack} + \text{Health} + \text{Intrinsic Value} \]

### Example
- For a card with 4 mana, 4 attack, and 3 health:
  \[ 4 = 4a + 3h + c + i \]
- For a card with 6 mana, 5 attack, and 2 health:
  \[ 6 = 5a + 2h + c + i \]
- For a card with 6 mana, 4 attack, 2 health, and divine shield:
  \[ 6 = 4a + 2h + c + d + i \]
- For a card with 3 mana, 3 attack, and 1 health, and divine shield:
  \[ 3 = 3a + 1h + d + i \]
- For a card with 1 mana, 1 attack, and 1 health, and divine shield:
  \[ 1 = 1a + 1h + d + i \]

### Reversing Attribute Cost
| Mana | Attack | Health | Charge | Divine Shield | Intrinsic Value |
|------|--------|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 4    | 4      | 3      | 1      | 0             | 1               |
| 6    | 5      | 2      | 1      | 0             | 1               |
| 6    | 4      | 2      | 1      | 1             | 1               |
| 3    | 3      | 1      | 0      | 1             | 1               |
| 1    | 1      | 1      | 0      | 1             | 1               |

### Least Square Method
- **Attack (a)**: 1
- **Health (h)**: -1
