APPENDIX A
SCHNORR SIGNATURES
Schnorr signatures are a prime example of the way secure
signatures can be constructed via the Fiat-Shamir transform
from secure identiﬁcation protocols. [21]. They achieve short,
efﬁcient signatures that are provably secure in the random
oracle model, assuming the hardness of the discrete logarithm
problem in the underlying group. The underlying Schnorr
identiﬁcation scheme, as well as the resulting signature scheme
when the Fiat-Shamir transform is applied, are depicted in
Fig. 10. Here, pp = (G, q, g) denote the public parameters of
the scheme where G is a cyclic group of prime order q with
generator g.
KGen(pp):
1 a $←− Fq
2 A ← ga
3 return (A, a)
Sign(a, m):
4 r $←− Fq
5 R ← gr
6 ch ← H(R, m)
7 S ← (R + ch · a) mod q
8 return σ ← (ch, S)
Vfy(A, m, σ = (ch, S)):
(cid:2) ← gS · A

10 ch
(cid:2) = ch(cid:3)

KGen(pp):

2 A ← ga
3 return (A, a)
P1(a):
4 r $←− Fq
5 R ← gr
6 return (R, a)
P2(ch, a):
7 S ← (R + ch · a) mod q
8 return S

APPENDIX B
FULL PROOFS
(cid:3)
A. Proof for Theorem 1
Proof. Assume there exists an adversary A against the (t
(cid:3)
)-
, 
IMP-KOA security of CID. From this we then construct
another adversary B, the reduction, that can solve the (t, ecdlp)-
ECDLP on E(Fq). Since we assume ECDLP to be hard to
break with non-negligible probability ecdlp in any reasonable
amount of time t, this then leads to a contradiction, yielding
IMP-KOA security. B is constructed as follows: B gets as input
the base point B ∈ E(Fq) of order L, as well as a random
