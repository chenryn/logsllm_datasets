does not contribute to increased read availability for the
TP with γ = 0.0. When p = 0.9, the read availability
for the TP with γ = 0.0 is less than 0.99. Figures 5(a)
and (b) indicate that applying γ effectively increases read
availability.
Figure 6 plots the average number of nodes accessed
for the probabilistic TP, as a function of parameter f. Fig-
ure 6(a) plots the results for sl = 2l + 3, h = 8, N = 99,
p = 0.9, and w = 1. Figure 6(b) plots the results for
sl = 2l + 3, h = 8, N = 99, p = 0.99, and w = 1. For
example, consider Fig. 6(a), where the average number of
nodes accessed for γ = 0.0, f = 0.4 is almost 10. Sim-
ilarly, the average number of nodes accessed for γ = 0.3
equals to 6. When p = 0.9, the increase in γ decreases the
average number of accessed node. The growth of f can
decrease the average number of accessed node. However,
the increase in f may concentrate read operations on the
top level.
Figure 7 plots the read availability for the probabilistic
TP, as a function of parameter γ. Figure 7(a) plots the
results for sl = 8l + 4, p = 0.9, and w = 1. Figure
7(b) plots the results for sl = 8l + 4, p = 0.99, and
w = 1. For example, consider Fig. 7(a), where the read
availability for h = 1, γ = 0.3 is about 0.999. The read
availability for h = 4, γ = 0.1, is almost 0.999. LV read
availabilities do not decrease when γ > 0.2. However,
read availabilities greatly increase as γ increases.
Figure 8 plots the average number of nodes accessed
for the probabilistic TP, as a function of parameter γ. Fig-
ure 8(a) plots the results for sl = 2l+3, p = 0.9, f = 0.3,
and w = 1. Figure 8(b) plots the results for sl = 2l + 3,
p = 0.99, f = 0.3, and w = 1. For example, consider
Fig. 8(a), where the average number of nodes accessed
for h = 2, 0 < γ < 0.5, is 5. Similarly, the number for
h = 8, 0.2 < γ < 0.5, is almost 7.5. The larger the h, the
more effective the increase in γ was in reducing load.
In Table 1, we can see the read availability for the prob-
abilistic TP and probabilistic QS. Table 1 lists the results
for probabilistic TP for sl = 2l + 3, h = 8, N = 99,
