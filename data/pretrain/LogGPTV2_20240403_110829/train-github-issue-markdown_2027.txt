Win10 Pro OS:
Ok I'm no rocket scientist but I installed the new "PowerToys.msi" file and
when I opened the program from the taskbar icon using "Settings" the box opens
up to a blank screen. I have only 3 options to choose from the taskbar
icon..."Settings, About and Exit".
Rebooted thinking that would help...NOT  
Removed and re-installed...NOT
Stumped on why it does not work...  
I know it's a beta but I was hoping for a bit more...
