**Windows 10 Pro OS:**

I am not an expert, but I recently installed the new "PowerToys.msi" file. When I open the program from the taskbar icon and select "Settings," a blank screen appears. The taskbar icon only provides three options: "Settings," "About," and "Exit."

I have tried the following troubleshooting steps:
- Rebooting the system
- Uninstalling and reinstalling PowerToys

Unfortunately, none of these actions resolved the issue. I understand that this is a beta version, but I was hoping for a more functional experience. Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.
