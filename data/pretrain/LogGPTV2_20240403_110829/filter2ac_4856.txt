**ATT&CK ID:** T1036.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Invalid Code Signature

Adversaries may attempt to mimic the characteristics of valid code signatures to deceive users, analysts, or security tools. Code signing is a process that provides a level of authenticity and integrity for a binary, ensuring it originates from the claimed developer and has not been tampered with. To exploit this, adversaries can copy the metadata and signature information from a legitimate, signed program and use it as a template for an unsigned, malicious program.

Files with invalid code signatures will fail digital signature validation checks. However, they may still appear more legitimate to users, and some security tools may improperly handle these files, potentially allowing the malicious code to go undetected.
