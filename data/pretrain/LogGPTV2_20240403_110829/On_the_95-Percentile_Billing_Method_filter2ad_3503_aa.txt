Abstract. The 95-percentile method is used widely for billing ISPs and web-
sites. In this work, we characterize important aspects of the 95-percentile method
using a large set of trafﬁc traces. We ﬁrst study how the 95-percentile depends on
the aggregation window size. We observe that the computed value often follows
a noisy decreasing trend along a convex curve as the window size increases. We
provide theoretical justiﬁcation for this dependence using the self-similar model
for Internet trafﬁc and discuss observed more complex dependencies in which the
95-percentile increases with the window size. Secondly, we quantify how varia-
tions on the window size affect the computed 95-percentile. In our experiments,
we ﬁnd that reasonable differences in the window size can account for an in-
crease between 4.1% and 42.5% in the monthly bill of medium and low-volume
sites. In contrast, for sites with average trafﬁc rates above 10Mbps the ﬂuctuation
of the 95-percentile is bellow 2.9%. Next, we focus on the use of ﬂow data in
hosting environments for billing individual sites. We describe the byte-shifting
effect introduced by ﬂow aggregation and quantify how it can affect the com-
puted 95-percentile. We ﬁnd that in our traces it can both decrease and increase
the computed 95-percentile with the largest change being a decrease of 9.3%.
1 Introduction
Transit ISPs and hosting providers monitor the trafﬁc usage of their customers and
typically charge them using the 95-percentile method. A period of a month is split into
ﬁxed size time intervals and each interval yields a sample that denotes the transferred
bytes during the interval. An automated tool polls the SNMP counters of the appropriate
router(s) or switch(es) and ﬁnds the transferred bytes. Then, the 95-percentile of the
distribution of samples is used for billing. Often the 95-percentile is computed both on
the inbound and the outbound directions and the smaller value is ignored.
In a billing cycle of 30 days, the 95-percentile method ﬁlters out 36 hours of spikes,
which may include Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, ﬂash crowds, and back-up traf-
ﬁc. The method essentially realizes a compromise between two objectives. The ﬁrst
objective is billing a customer based on its absolute trafﬁc usage, whereas the second
objective is billing based on the capacity of the provisioned links and the peak rates.
If we consider the trafﬁc rate as a continuous signal, then the ﬁrst objective suggests
using the average of the signal for billing, whereas the second objective suggests using
the maximum. The 95-percentile is typically between the average and the maximum
balancing, in this way, the two objectives.

Nevertheless, the 95-percentile is not the result of a sophisticated optimization. Cer-
tain large ISPs started using it many years ago and, over time, it became more widely-
used and established. The properties and limitations (also due to operational constrains)
of the method have not been systematically studied and are not well understood. For ex-
ample, the window size used for computing the 95-percentile can vary between different
providers. Most commonly a 5-minute interval is used, however used values range to as
low as 30 seconds [1]. The effect of such variations on the 95-percentile has not been
analyzed. In addition, the 95-percentile method is often applied on trafﬁc ﬂow data for
billing, e.g., individual websites. The relationship between ﬂow aggregation and the
95-percentile, as we discuss further in our paper, is a challenging research problem.
In this work, we characterize important aspects of the 95-percentile billing method
using several trafﬁc traces. We ﬁrst analyze how the 95-percentile depends on the win-
dow size and ﬁnd that it typically exhibits a noisy convex decreasing trend, although
more complex inter-dependencies are also possible. Then, we make the assumption that
network trafﬁc is self-similar to provide a mathematical explanation of the observed
decreasing dependence. We quantify ﬂuctuations on the 95-percentile due to different
window sizes and ﬁnd that ﬂuctuations are 1) signiﬁcant, i.e., between 4.1% and 42.5%
for low volume sites with average rates bellow 10 Mbps, and 2) negligible, i.e., bellow
2.9%, for high volume sites with average rates above 10 Mbps. Next, we describe how
the byte-shifting effect of ﬂow aggregation can affect the computed 95-percentile. We
characterize the extent of byte-shifting and ﬁnd that in our traces up to 35.3% of the
total number of bytes can be shifted between neighboring windows causing a decrease
on the 95-percentile by 9.3%.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in the next section we describe
the trafﬁc traces we used for our experiments. In Section 3, we characterize the depen-
dence of the 95-percentile on the size of the aggregation window. Then, in Section 4 we
analyze the effect of ﬂow aggregation on the 95-percentile billing method and provide
supporting measurement results. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 5.
2 Data Traces and Preprocessing
We used trafﬁc traces collected with tcpdump [2] and NetFlow [3] on two distinct net-
works. The ﬁrst network provided web hosting services to 46 websites of varying sizes.
We collected unsampled NetFlow version 9 packets from the border router of the net-
work that transferred more than 6 TBytes a day with average sending and receiving
rates of 550Mbps and 100Mbps, respectively. The NetFlow trace spanned 27 days dur-
ing April 2008. In addition, we used tcpdump to collect packet headers destined to or
originating from an individual medium-volume website. The tcpdump trace spanned 30
days starting on the 17th of July 2007 and the average rate was 615 Kbps.
The second network was a medium-size enterprise campus network that receives
transit services from a commercial and an academic ISP. In particular, we collected
data from the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory campus that hosts approximately 300
employees and at least as many networked computers. For our experiments, we used
a tcpdump trace collected over a period of approximately 63 continuous days, from
the 2nd of March until the 5th of May 2008. The trace includes all the outgoing and
incoming packet headers and the overall average trafﬁc rate was 7.536 Mbps.

We processed the tcpdump and NetFlow traces and created a set of trafﬁc volume
time series for our experiments. We ﬁrst parsed the tcpdump data collected from the
campus network and computed the total (both inbound and outbound) number of bytes
observed in each consecutive second. In this way, we derived a sequence of Byte counts,
which we split into two time series that spanned approximately one month each.
In addition, we derived a time series for each individual website in the hosting en-
vironment. We used the NetFlow trace and associated ﬂows with sites based on the
known IP addresses of the latter. Then, we distributed the size of a ﬂow uniformly over
its time-span and derived how much each ﬂow contributed to each one-second window.
By aggregating the contributions of the ﬂows, we constructed a baseline time series that
indicates the total bytes sent and received from a site during each consecutive second.
In this way, we derived a time series for each individual website. Out of the 46 sites,
we ignored the time series that corresponded to the 12 lowest-volume sites that had on
average a rate smaller than 1 Kbps. These sites appeared virtually unused and, there-
fore, we used the remaining 34 sites for our experiments. In addition, we derived one
last time series from the tcpdump trace for the individual website using the procedure
we outlined above.
Overall, we used 37 time series with an one-second time resolution. We call these
time series baselines. To measure the effect of the aggregation window size, we aggre-
gated the baselines using windows of varying size and computed the 95-percentile of
the aggregated series that we report in our experiments.
3 95-Percentile versus Window Size
3.1 Measurements
Using the different traces, we ﬁrst examine how the 95-percentile depends on the win-
dow size. In Figure 1(a), we illustrate the relationship between the 95-percentile and
the window size for the trafﬁc of the enterprise campus network. The computed 95-
percentile reﬂects what a transit provider would charge the network. As the size of the
aggregation window decreases, we observe that the 95-percentile increases. The 95-
percentiles corresponding to a window size of 30 seconds increases by 5% with respect
to the 95-percentile of a 300-second window.
Secondly, we examine how the 95-percentile depends on the window size in the case
of a web-hosting provider charging a high-volume website. In Figure 1(b), we illustrate
the corresponding plot for the website in our traces that had the highest mean trafﬁc
volume. We observe again that the 95-percentile exhibits a noisy decreasing trend as
the window size increases. In this case the relative ﬂuctuations of the 95-percentile are
smaller than in the campus network. The 95-percentile increases by only 0.7% between
a 300 and a 30-second window. In the set of 95-percentile values that correspond to
window sizes between 30 and 400 seconds, the maximum 95-percentile increase we
observed was 1.3%1.
1 Note that in Figure 1(b) we also illustrate the behavior of the 95-percentile for window sizes
between 2 and 30 seconds, however, we do not use this range of values to ﬁnd the maximum
95-percentile increase, as in practice such low window sizes are unlikely.

Fig. 1. 95-percentile versus aggregation window size
We plotted and examined the dependence of the 95-percentile on the window size
for each individual site. For 23 out of the 34 sites the dependence on the window size
had two characteristics in common with Figures 1(a) and 1(b): 1) the 95-percentile
gradually decreases following approximately a convex curve; and 2) the 95-percentile
curve is noisy often exhibiting signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations between nearby points. Among
the remaining 11 sites that did not follow the identiﬁed trend, 5 exhibited a very low
monthly trafﬁc volume that on average remained bellow 50 Kbps. The last 6 medium-
volume sites had irregularities in their trafﬁc patterns, like lack of time-of-the-day or
day-of-the-week effects, occasionally very high bit-rates, or long down-time periods. In
Figure 1(c), we illustrate the dependence for one of the sites we identiﬁed irregularities.
In this case the 95-percentile increases with the window size, which phenomenon we
traced back to very high periodical trafﬁc spikes. The spikes were close to a maximum
two orders of magnitude larger than the mean trafﬁc rate.
We further study how the ﬂuctuations on the 95-percentile relate to the mean trafﬁc
rates of the sites. We deﬁne the maximum ﬂuctuation of the 95-percentile to be the in-
crease of the largest over the smallest value in a set of 95-percentile values. For each
baseline time series, we computed aggregate time series using window sizes between
30 to 400 seconds. Then, for the aggregate time series we computed the corresponding
95-percentiles and found their maximum ﬂuctuation. Figure 2 plots the maximum ﬂuc-
tuation of the sites versus their mean trafﬁc rate. We observe that as the mean trafﬁc
rate of a site increases, the ﬂuctuation on the computed 95-percentile decreases. For
high-volume sites with mean trafﬁc rate above 10 Mbps, the maximum ﬂuctuation is
bellow 2.9%. On the other hand, for medium and low-volume sites with mean trafﬁc
rate lower than 10 Mbps the maximum ﬂuctuation is larger reaching up to 915% in one
extreme case, but mainly varying between 4.1% and 42.5%. This observation suggests
that changes in the window size can introduce notable variations in the computed 95-
percentile value only on sites and networks with small and medium trafﬁc rates. On the
other hand, high-volume sites or large networks and ISPs are not signiﬁcantly affected
by varying the window size.
3.2 Analysis
We can model the effect of the window size as an aggregation process that takes the
mean of each consecutive m samples of a trafﬁc volume series as to construct an aggre-
gate time series a(m)
. Taking the mean tends to decrease the volume of large samples

and makes the 95-percentile smaller. In theory, however, increasing the window size
may also result in an increase on the 95-percentile. We illustrate this with a simple ex-
ample. Assume that the baseline time series as corresponds to one-second time intervals
and that the maximum number of aggregated samples mu corresponds to one month.
In this extreme case, the aggregated time series a(mu)
has a unique sample that is equal
to the overall mean of as. The 95-percentile of a(mu)
is also equal to the overall mean
trafﬁc volume ¯as. In addition, consider that the 95-percentile of the baseline as can
be smaller than ¯as, which indicates that the aggregation process will tend to increase
the 95-percentile. In practice, however, real-world trafﬁc signals typically have a mean
that is smaller than their 95-percentile. The mean and 95-percentile of the baseline time
series corresponding to the 1st-month trace of the campus network are 7.3 Mbps and
24.1 Mbps, respectively. As a result, increasing the window size tends to decrease the
95-percentile.
Internet trafﬁc is known [4,5] to exhibit scaling effects. Let X(s) and X (m)(s) de-
note the processes that generate as and a(m)
, respectively. If we assume that the two
processes exhibit exact self-similarity [4] with Hurst parameter H, then their distribu-
tions are related:
s
X (m)(s) d= mH−1X(s).
In addition, the (1− γ)-quantiles X1−γ(s) and X (m)
1−γ(s) of the distributions are related:
1−γ(s) = mH−1X1−γ(s).
X (m)
(1)
For Internet trafﬁc, the Hurst parameter H takes values between 0.5 and 1. Fix-
ing X1−γ(s) in the last equation and setting γ to 0.05, we get that the 95-percentile
of the aggregated time series decreases polynomially as the aggregation window m
increases. This behavior is consistent with our observations in Figure 1 and with the
remaining ﬁgures for the 23 other sites.
Besides, Figure 2 indicates that ﬂuctuations on the 95-percentile are larger for low
and medium-volume sites and smaller for high-volume sites. Higher volume sites are
associated with a higher degree of statistical multiplexing. As a result, they exhibit a
lower trafﬁc burstiness than low and medium-volume sites. We speculate that this lower
212
X. Dimitropoulos et al.
burstiness results in smaller ﬂuctuations on the 95-percentile. We can use the relative
standard deviation (RSD) of a distribution, i.e., the standard deviation divided by the
mean, to quantify the burstiness of a trafﬁc signal. The RSD is computed on the baseline
time series before aggregation. In Figure 3 we illustrate the rank correlation between
and RSD and the maximum 95-percentile ﬂuctuation of the websites. We see that the
points are aligned mostly along the line on the 45-degree angle, which indicates a strong
correlation between the RSD and the maximum 95-percentile ﬂuctuation. The Spear-
man correlation coefﬁcient, in particular, is 0.84. This high correlation suggests that a
high (low) degree of trafﬁc burstiness results in more (fewer) 95-percentile ﬂuctuations.
Trafﬁc burstiness can easily be quantiﬁed (using RSD) and, therefore, it can serve as
indicator on how susceptible a site and a network is to 95-percentile ﬂuctuations.
