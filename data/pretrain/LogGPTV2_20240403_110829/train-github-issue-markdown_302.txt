Similar to Fancy Zones be able to define locations for Windows to be
positioned in response to specific scenarios - in this can switching between
single and dual (or more) monitor configurations - either docking/undocking a
laptop, or connecting to a remote desktop session with "use all monitors" or a
single screen.
A specific use-case:  
I usually work with my Windows VM via a remote desktop scenario where I have
two screens. My 'host' in my Macbook with an external monitor, and Windows via
Remote Desktop supports that very well, allowing me to use both screens and
arrange windows where I want/need them... but, if I'm away from that desktop
and connect via my iPad or my laptop without it's external screen then all the
remote desktop windows get 'gathered' back into the single screen (desired
behavior), but when I log back in via the dual screen configuration I have to
waste time moving windows back to my preferred layout.
Would love to be able to set up rules so that (eg) when moving to a single
screen Windows behaves as normal, but when a second screen is available
automatically move (VSCode, Chrome, Powerpoint) to the second screen (ideally
it would remember the positions they were in before they had been 'gathered'
across to the single monitor and so revert to actual positions and sizes
rather than just retain relative sizing/position to where they had been in the
gathered scenario
