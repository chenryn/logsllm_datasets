I need to monitor JBoss to determine whether it is running or not using Icinga. Checking the status via `/etc/init.d/jboss` is not sufficient, as the service might be up, but some JBoss processes could be killed or hung, causing JBoss to malfunction.

To address this, I plan to create a script that monitors all JBoss processes by analyzing the output of `ps`. However, JBoss can run in different modes—standalone, domain (master), and domain (slave)—each with its own set of processes. This adds complexity to the monitoring task.

I am unsure about where to start and would appreciate any guidance or ideas from those who have tackled a similar challenge. 

**Assistant:**
To achieve this, I used the following commands:
- For standalone mode: `ps aux | grep "\-D\[Standalone\]"`
- For domain mode: `ps aux | grep "\-D\[Server\]"`

These commands help identify the relevant JBoss processes based on their mode of operation.
