User: I want to monitor jboss if its running or not through Icinga.
I don't want to check /etc/inid.d/jboss status as sometimes service is up but some of the jboss is killed or hang & jboss doesn't work properly.
I would like to create a script to monitor all of its process from ps output. But few servers are running in standalone mode, domain(master,slave) and processes are different for each case.
I'm not sure from where do I start. Anyone here who did same earlier? Just looking for the idea to do this.
Assistant: I did this by monitored jboss process using ps aux | grep "\-D\[Standalone\]" for standalone mode and ps aux | grep "\-D\[Server" for domain mode.
