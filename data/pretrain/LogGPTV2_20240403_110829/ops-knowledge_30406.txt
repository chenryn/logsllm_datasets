Assistant: To convert a Linux server into an FTP server and provide URLs for uploading and downloading files, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install FTP service software, such as vsftpd, Pure-FTPd, etc. You can use the following commands to install: Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install vsftpd CentOS: sudo yum install vsftpd 2. Configure the FTP server. Find the configuration file of the FTP service software, usually in /etc/vsftpd.conf or /etc/pure-ftpd.conf, and configure it as needed, such as setting the directory of FTP users and allowing anonymous login. 3. Start the FTP service. Use the following commands to start the FTP service: sudo service vsftpd start (vsftpd) sudo service pure-ftpd start (Pure-FTPd) 4. Set the firewall to allow FTP access. If you use a firewall, you need to allow FTP protocol access, such as setting iptables rules: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT 5. Provide URLs for FTP upload and download files. The FTP server uses port 21 by default. You can use ftp://<server IP address> or ftp://<server domain name> to access the FTP server, such as: ftp://192.168.1.100 ftp://example.com In addition, You can also provide customized URLs for uploading and downloading files via FTP by setting up FTP virtual hosts and FTP user accounts.
