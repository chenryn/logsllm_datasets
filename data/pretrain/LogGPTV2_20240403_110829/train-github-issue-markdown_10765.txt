#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
    # Your code here
    import pandas as pd
    tables = pd.read_html('D:\\myhtml.html', header=0)
    print (tables)
#### Problem description
[The html code looks like below. Note simple table scrapping looks good but on
this one exactly it is not working as expected  
The html code
I have a html file locally with multiple tables. Sometimes the content of the
table is exactly the same including headers. While reading it through pandas I
have noticed that when two tables are exactly identical it will drop the
second one as if it is not there. When I change one Value value in the second
table it will read the second table also and display.
How can i stop pandas doing that and read every table. Or is it a feature or
bug  
Attaching the exact HTML file in link. If you see there are 4 tables. Still I
get only 3 tables values. The big 2 two tables have exact same data and it is
publishing only first one

**Note** : Many problems can be resolved by simply upgrading `pandas` to the
latest version. Before submitting, please check  
if that solution works for you. If possible, you may want to check if `master`
addresses this issue, but that is not necessary.
#### Expected Output
Ideally it should show 4 tables. Showing only 3
