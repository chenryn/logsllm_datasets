# Bug report
## Describe the bug
On certain browsers, like Chrome on iOS, there is already a progress bar in
place causing duplicate progress bars when using the with-loading example
repo.
## To Reproduce
  1. Follow instructions on https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-loading to set project up.
  2. Install and run locally
  3. Navigate to the non-existing page using Chrome on iOS
## Expected behavior
NProgress should not be displayed for browsers that have default progress
bars. This is a next.js issue because the example should account for the
behavior of NProgress.
