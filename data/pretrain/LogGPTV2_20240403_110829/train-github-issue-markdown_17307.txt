Subject: Issue with Plugin Installation and Search Functionality

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue I have encountered after installing a plugin in ATOM. Following the installation, I am unable to search for and install additional plugins without restarting the ATOM editor. This disrupts my workflow, as it requires me to close and reopen the application each time I wish to add a new plugin.

For your reference, I have attached a screenshot (taken on June 26, 2015, at 8:31 PM) that illustrates the problem I'm facing. The image can be viewed [here](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5646166/8380330/c6b4c4b6-1c42-11e5-96bb-a2834ed9f024.png).

I would greatly appreciate any assistance or guidance you could provide to resolve this inconvenience.

Best regards,
