User: I have two python scripts running as cronjobs.
ScriptA processes log files and insert records to a table, ScriptB uses the records to generate a report.
I have arranged ScriptA to run one hour before ScriptB, but sometimes ScriptB run before ScriptA finish inserting, thus generating a incorrect report.
How do I make sure ScriptB runs right after ScriptA finishes?
EDIT
ScriptA and ScriptB do very different things, say, one is for saving user data, the other is for internal use. And somewhere else there maybe some ScriptC depending on ScriptA.
So I can't just merge these two jobs.
Assistant: an approach that you could use it! is having some flag of control! somewhere, for example in the DB! 
So ScriptB just runs after that flag is set! and right after it finish it it sets the flag back to default state!
Another way that you could implement that flag approach is using file system! Like @Benjamin suggested!
