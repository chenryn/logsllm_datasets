### Data Collection and Analysis

#### Initial Query Execution
We executed a single query in the format "no prescription [drug name]" for each drug on our list. We collected the first 64 results for each query, totaling 9,000 queries over five days in August 2010. Approximately 2,500 of these queries returned no search results. Among the queries that did return results, we observed at least one redirection in the search results for 4,350 terms.

#### Infected Websites and Webalizer Logs
For the second phase, we examined server logs from 169 infected websites to identify drug-related search terms that redirected to online pharmacies. We obtained this information using The Webalizer, a tool that generates monthly reports based on HTTP logs, detailing visitor statistics, popular pages, and other relevant data. These reports are often left "world-readable" in a standard location on the server, making them accessible to anyone.

In August 2010, we checked 3,806 infected websites for Webalizer, finding it accessible on 169 of them. We recorded all available data, which typically included monthly activity reports up to and including the current month. One of the sub-reports generated by Webalizer lists the search terms used to locate the site. While not all reports include referrer terms, we found 83 websites that listed drug names in the referrer terms for one or more months. Since we identified the infected servers running Webalizer by inspecting the results of 218 queries from our main corpus, it is unsurprising that 98 of these terms appeared in the logs. Additionally, the logs contained 1,179 search queries with drug terms, which we used as an extra queries list for comparison against the main corpus.

#### Additional Queries and Data Collection
We collected the top 64 results for the extra queries list daily between October 20 and 31, 2010. When comparing these results to our main query corpus, we only considered the results obtained during this period, resulting in a significantly smaller number of results than our complete nine-month collection.

#### Comparison of Query Lists
We compared the main list to the additional lists in three ways:
1. **Search Result Classification**: We analyzed the types of results obtained.
2. **TLD and PageRank Distribution**: We compared the distribution of Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and PageRanks for source infections.
3. **Domain Intersection**: We computed the intersection between the domains obtained by both sets of queries for source infections, redirects, and pharmacies.

#### Results and Observations
- **Search Result Classification**:
  - **FDA Drug List**: 25% of URIs were infections, compared to 44% in the main list. 13% of the results pointed to legitimate health resources, compared to 3% in the main sample. Illicit pharmacies appeared slightly less often (6% vs. 8%), while blog and forum spam was more prevalent (25% vs. 19%).
  - **Extra Queries List**: This list showed more blog infections and fewer source infections compared to the main list. The URI breakdown for health resources was closer (4.9% vs. 2.4%).

- **TLD Breakdown**:
  - The TLD distribution was roughly similar, with .com appearing slightly more often in the FDA drugs and extra queries results, while .org and .edu appeared more frequently in the main sample.

- **PageRank Distribution**:
  - The PageRank for the drugs and extra queries list was slightly lower than the main sample, but the difference was minor.

#### Estimating the Number of Affected Sites
To estimate the total number of affected domains, we applied capture-recapture analysis. This method uses repeated sampling to estimate population sizes. Despite the assumptions of homogeneity and closure not entirely holding, we used this method to get a first approximation of the greater population size.

- **Source Infections**:
  - FDA Drugs: 1,516
  - Main: 403
  - Extra Queries: 934
  - Capture-Recapture Estimate: 6,367

- **Redirects**:
  - FDA Drugs: 185
  - Main: 55
  - Extra Queries: 58
  - Capture-Recapture Estimate: 493

- **Pharmacies**:
  - FDA Drugs: 192
  - Main: 9
  - Extra Queries: 104
  - Capture-Recapture Estimate: 2,523 (FDA Drugs) and 795 (Main)

These estimates provide a better understanding of the magnitude of the activity studied in this paper.
