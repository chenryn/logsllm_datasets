### Simulate Restore

**Description:**
This command tests whether the writers will successfully participate in a restore session on the computer, without actually issuing PreRestore or PostRestore events to the writers.

**Note:**
To use the `simulate restore` command, a DiskShadow metadata file must be loaded. Use the `load metadata` command to load the selected writers and components for the restore.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
simulate restore
```

**Explanation:**
- **Simulate Restore:** This command is used to verify the compatibility and readiness of the system for a restore operation by simulating the process.
- **Metadata File:** A DiskShadow metadata file is required to provide the necessary information about the writers and components involved in the restore.
- **Load Metadata Command:** Before running `simulate restore`, you must first load the metadata file using the `load metadata` command. This ensures that the correct writers and components are included in the simulation.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the restore process will proceed smoothly without any issues related to writer involvement.
