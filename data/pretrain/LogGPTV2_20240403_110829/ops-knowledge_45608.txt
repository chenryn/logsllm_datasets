User: I am developing a webpage in django (on my pc with windows 7) and now i need to test some pages in tablet pcs. suddenly the thought came if i can have an access to my localhost in windows from android tablet. is that possible? I am in the same wifi connection in both devices at home. 
i read a lot questions and answers regarding this issue in stackoverflow and other places, but none of them gave me some concrete solutions. 
I have samsung tab 2 10.1 with android 4.0.4.
appreciate any help, thanks
Assistant: need to know the ip address of your machine .. 
Make sure both of your machines (tablet and computer) connected to same network
192.168.0.22 - say your machine address
do this :
192.168.0.22:8000   -- from your tablet
this is it !!!
