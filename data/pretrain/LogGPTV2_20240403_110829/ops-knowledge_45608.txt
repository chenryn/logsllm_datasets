I am developing a webpage using Django on my PC, which runs Windows 7. I now need to test some pages on a tablet. I was wondering if it is possible to access my localhost from an Android tablet. Both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network at home.

I have read numerous questions and answers on Stack Overflow and other forums, but I haven't found a concrete solution yet. My tablet is a Samsung Tab 2 10.1 running Android 4.0.4.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**Response:**

To access your Django development server from your Android tablet, you need to know the IP address of your Windows PC. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Find Your PC's IP Address:**
   - Open Command Prompt on your Windows PC.
   - Type `ipconfig` and press Enter.
   - Look for the IPv4 Address under the section for your Wi-Fi adapter (e.g., `192.168.0.22`).

2. **Ensure Both Devices Are on the Same Network:**
   - Make sure both your PC and your Android tablet are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

3. **Access the Development Server:**
   - On your Android tablet, open a web browser.
   - Enter the IP address of your PC followed by the port number where your Django server is running. For example, if your PC's IP address is `192.168.0.22` and your Django server is running on port `8000`, you would enter:
     ```
     http://192.168.0.22:8000
     ```

That should allow you to access your Django development server from your Android tablet. If you encounter any issues, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further.
