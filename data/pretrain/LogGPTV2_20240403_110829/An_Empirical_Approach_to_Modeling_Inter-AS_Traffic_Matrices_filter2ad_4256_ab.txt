RIPE, and c ≈ −1.1 for APNIC). The steep fall-off of the
curves in the region of low-ranking ASs is likely due to the
limited coverage our keyword-based crawling process has
of their web content.
The key underlying assumption in our empirical method
is that to infer the popularity of content networks, a feasi-
ble alternative to using actual web trafﬁc measurement is to
rely on data that measures the appearance of web content
in search results. Strictly speaking, this alternative method
can only account for trafﬁc from users actively seeking
speciﬁc information, not trafﬁc from users visiting book-
marked pages or links on web pages. However, due to our
decision to use the top 10,000 most popular keywords, we
expect the resulting bias to be small. It is well-known that
Google’s PageRank weighting algorithm carefully consid-
ers web link structures (e.g., links that a page receives) in
calculating link values. As a result, we believe that our
method does implicitly account for some aspects of actual
link trafﬁc.
Ideally, characterizing web service utility should make
use of measured inter-domain web trafﬁc, as is done for
example by Feldman et al. [9]. However, this requires ac-
cess to server logs of widely-deployed private CDNs. Such
data is not publicly available. These data sets are also lim-
ited in their coverage: they capture only web content served
by the CDN, and they do not capture web trafﬁc emanating
from content providers who are not clients of the CDNs.
These difﬁculties illustrate the technical challenges associ-
ated with accurate estimation of inter-domain web trafﬁc.
Viewing our method as one of many viable approaches to
making progress in this area, it exempliﬁes how a combi-
nation of publicly obtainable and publicly available data
sets can be used to infer inter-domain trafﬁc volume. At
the same time, the method is ﬂexible enough to incorpo-
rate web server logs from CDNs should such logs become
publicly available.
3.2 Residential Access
To infer an AS’s utility in providing residential Internet
access, we estimate it by the number of P2P ﬁle sharing
users of the AS. Besides web browsing, P2P ﬁle-sharing
is currently one of the most popular applications on the
Internet (cachelogic.com). To estimate the number
of users per AS, we perform measurement experiments
involving three different ﬁle sharing systems: BitTorrent
(bittorrent.com), eDonkey (edonkey2000.com),
and Gnutella (gnutella.com). At the time of our study,
these were among the most popular ﬁle sharing systems in
use on the Internet [4].2
Most P2P ﬁle sharing systems have built-in mecha-
nisms to discover existing users, which makes estimation
of ﬁle sharing population relatively straight forward. The
Gnutella system employs a decentralized approach to ﬁle

searching: individual Gnutella peers form an overlay net-
work to propagate search messages. The eDonkey systems,
on the other hand, relies on dedicated, centralized servers
which peers must contact to search for a ﬁle. Similarly,
BitTorrent relies on centralized Trackers from which a peer
can obtain a list of other peers serving a particular ﬁle.
To estimate the population of BitTorrent, we down-
loaded about 2,800 torrent ﬁles from a well-known
BitTorrent web site (torrentspy.com). A torrent
ﬁle contains the meta data of a shared ﬁle, among
tracker cog-
which is the address of
nizant of peers
Using BTtools
(bagley.org/˜doug/project/bttools), we ob-
tained from each tracker a list of peers in possession of
complete copies of the ﬁle (seeds in BitTorrent parlance).
Over a period of four days, we collected about 634,000 dis-
tinct IP addresses of BitTorrent peers.
sharing the ﬁle.
the BitTorrent
To estimate the population of eDonkey, we ran a toy
eDonkey server and recorded the IP addresses of all the
peers that contacted our server. eDonkey servers run a gos-
sip protocol among themselves to maintain an up-to-date
list of the server population. Each eDonkey peer maintains
a list of servers and sends them periodic ping messages. In
one day, our eDonkey server collected about 1,014,000 dis-
tinct IP addresses of eDonkey peers from these ping mes-
sages.
Finally, for the purpose of estimating the population of
Gnutella, we ran a Gnutella client application on 20 Plan-
etLab nodes (10 in North America, 5 in Asia-Paciﬁc, and
5 in Europe) and recorded the IP addresses of all Gnutella
peers which exchanged trafﬁc with us. Over a period of one
week, we collected about 542,000 distinct IP addresses of
Gnutella peers.
In total, we collected about 2.19 million distinct P2P
IP addresses, which we subsequently mapped to their cor-
responding AS using BGP routing tables. Denoting by
URA(X) the utility of AS X as a residential Internet ac-
cess provider, we computed this quantity for every AS X
by counting the number of distinct P2P IP addresses as-
sociated with AS X. Of course, some P2P users perform
more active downloads/uploads than others. By aggregat-
ing a sufﬁcient number of IP addresses, we try to mini-
mize any error that may be caused by ignoring such ﬁne-

grained ﬁle sharing activity. We sort ASs by their utility
URA(·) in decreasing order and assign them ranks, denoted
RRA(·). Table 4 lists the top-10 residential access ASs by
region. In the European and Asia-Paciﬁc regions, most of
the high-ranking residential access providers are associated
with telecom companies.
In the North American region,
retail Internet access business is more diversely distributed
among telecom carriers and cable companies. Fig. 2 shows
the entire RRA vs. URA distribution, for all three P2P ﬁle-
sharing applications individually as well as for their aggre-
gate.
In agreement with a recent study based on propri-
etary data set [20], URA(·) associated with the top 100 or
so highest-ranking ASs can be characterized as a Zipf-type
law with parameter -0.9.
One caveat in measuring P2P network usage is that the
user base of different P2P systems is not uniformly dis-
tributed across residential networks [19]. Since several P2P
applications with distinct features and evolving popular-
ity coexist, relying on a single application may introduce
sampling bias in capturing residential population. Our use
of three popular ﬁle-sharing systems provides a reasonable
coverage of the current ﬁle-sharing population. Our utility
measurements can also be extended to not only cover other
emerging P2P systems as they become popular, but also to
include proprietary data such as per-AS statistics on resi-
dential subscriptions (including the amount of trafﬁc gen-
erated by its connected residential customers), should the
latter become publicly available.

3.3 Business Access
Our approach to infer an AS’s utility in providing busi-
ness access relies on publicly available BGP routing ta-
bles to estimate the AS’s bandwidth distribution. From a
BGP routing table, one can infer provider-customer rela-
tionship among different ASs [10], and a naive estimate
of an AS’s bandwidth distribution would be the number of
its customer ASs. However, this lump-sum measure does
not distinguish between customer ASs of different sizes.
A more meaningful measure of an AS’s bandwidth distri-
bution is the number of downstream ASs that are reach-
able from the AS, following the provider-customer rela-
tionship chains. A large transit customer AS with a high
bandwidth requirement will then be properly weighted by
its number of downstream customers. If a customer AS is
multi-homed, i.e., obtaining its Internet access from several
providers, it would typically impose lower bandwidth re-
quirements on each provider than if it were single-homed.
To infer UBA(X), the utility of AS X of providing busi-
ness access, we assume that every AS has a unit bandwidth
requirement. We then percolate each AS’s bandwidth re-
quirement up the provider-customer relationship hierarchy.
When an AS is multi-homed, its per-provider bandwidth re-
quirement gets divided by the number of its providers. We
estimate UBA(X) in terms of the bandwidth distribution of
AS X, computed as shown in Table 5.
Table 5: Computation of UBA(·)
for every AS X,
unmark X.
UBA(X) = 0.
C(X) = # of X’s customer ASs.
P (X) = # of X’s provider ASs.
while (1)
for each unmarked X with C(X) = 0,
mark X.
for each provider Y of X,
UBA(Y ) = UBA(Y ) + UBA(X)+1.0
decrement C(Y ) by one.
P (X)
if no AS has C(·) > 0, exit.
We then sort those ASs with UBA(·) > 0 in decreasing
order and assign them ranks, denoted RBA(·). When dif-
ferent ASs have the same UBA(·) value, we break ties by
the size of the ASs’ BGP-advertised address space. Ta-
ble 6 lists the top-10 bandwidth reseller ASs. Most of
them are associated with well-known tier-1 ISPs that op-
erate continent-wide backbone networks. Note that in the
European and Asia-Paciﬁc regions, many top-ranking ASs
are telecom companies.
We caution that our assumption of unit bandwidth re-
quirement per AS may be too simplistic. For example,
business customers which are not assigned public AS num-
bers are ignored in the computation of the UBA(·) value. A
more precise estimate of such intra-AS business customers
could be obtained by examining intra-AS router-level con-
nectivity, which, unfortunately, is not easy to discover from
passive measurements. We rely here on an AS’s address
space size to partially account for the presence of such
“hidden” customer ASs. Having access to proprietary in-
formation on intra-AS business customers would simplify
this problem considerably.
3.4 Discussion
In the absence of readily available information about AS
business models, our proposed methodology for inferring
an AS’s business model is based on the following assump-
tions: (1) ASs’ web service utilities can be gleaned from the
usage patterns of a popular web search engine, (2) utilizing
widely adopted ﬁle sharing applications, an AS’s residen-
tial access utility can be inferred from the size of its ﬁle
sharing population, and (3) an AS’s business access utility,
as measured by its bandwidth distribution, can be estimated
by counting its downstream AS customers. A careful study
of the robustness of the proposed methodology to viola-
tions of these assumptions (e.g., a more URL-dependent
network usage, non P2P-based residential access, a more
cost-driven approach to providing business access) is nec-
essary, but is left for future work.
Our measurement method identiﬁed about 40% of all
BGP-advertised ASs as providing some form of Web host-
ing service, about 30% as providing residential access, and
about 15% as providing business access.3 The union of
all identiﬁed ASs covers about 56% of all BGP-advertised
ASs. Although close to 50% of all ASs are not categorized
by our method, these are typically small ASs generating
negligible trafﬁc volume. For example, according to Net-
