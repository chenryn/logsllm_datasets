Table 1 summarizes all graph theory notations used in this
paper (following the convention of [25]).
Let n := |L| denote the number of links in G, {li}n
i=1 the
set of links in G, w = (Wl1 , . . . , Wln )T the column vector
of all link metrics, and c = (WP1 , . . . , WPγ )T the column
vector of all available path measurements, where γ is the
number of measurement paths and WPi is the sum of link
metrics along measurement path Pi. We assume that moni-
tors can control the routing of measurement packets as long
as the path starts and ends at distinct monitors and does
not contain repeated nodes. In the language of graph the-
ory, we limit measurements to simple paths (in contrast, a
non-simple path may contain repeated nodes). The path
measurements are expressed in terms of the unknown link
metrics through the following linear system:
Rw = c,
(1)
where R = (Rij) is a γ × n measurement matrix , with each
entry Rij ∈ {0, 1} denoting whether link lj is present on
path Pi. The network tomography problem is to invert this
linear system to solve for w given R and c.
A link is identiﬁable if the associated link metric can be
uniquely determined from path measurements; network G is
identiﬁable if all links in G are identiﬁable. Otherwise, the
link or the network is said to be unidentiﬁable. Given the
above linear system, G is identiﬁable if and only if R in (1)
has full column rank, i.e., rank(R) = n. In other words, to
uniquely determine w, there must be n linearly independent
simple paths between monitors.
2.2 Objective
Given a network topology G, the ﬁrst objective of this pa-
per is to derive necessary and suﬃcient conditions for identi-
fying all link metrics in G (or certain subgraphs of G) under
a given placement of κ (κ ≥ 2) monitors by solving the linear
system (1). Our second objective is to compute a placement
of the minimum number of monitors in G that enables the
identiﬁcation of all link metrics.
2.3 Illustrative Example
Fig. 1 displays a sample network with three monitors (m1–
m3) and eleven links (links l1–l11). To identify all eleven link
metrics, eleven end-to-end paths (one m1 → m2 path, seven
m1 → m3 paths and three m3 → m2 paths) are constructed
to form the measurement matrix R:
m1 → m2 :
l1 l4 l8 l11

where Rij = 1 if and only if link lj is on path Pi. Then we
have Rw = c, where c is the vector of end-to-end measure-
ments taken at the destination monitors. In this example,
R is invertible, and thus w can be uniquely identiﬁed, i.e.,
w = R−1c. In Fig. 1, other simple paths can be measured as
well, although they do not provide further information since
the measurement matrix already reaches full rank. How-
ever, if we remove a monitor, say m3, then it can be veriﬁed
that the remaining paths can no longer form an invertible
measurement matrix. Note that a path such as l2l5l4l3l6l9
cannot be measured because it contains a cycle.
3. MAIN RESULTS
Our main contributions are a set of necessary and suﬃ-
cient conditions for network identiﬁcation that are explic-
itly expressed in terms of network topology and the num-
ber/placement of monitors (proofs of theorems can be found
in Sections 4–6). To begin, we ﬁrst establish a negative re-
sult that no matter where we place the monitors, we cannot
identify all link metrics using only two monitors.
Theorem 3.1. For any given network topology G with
n ≥ 2 (n is the number of links), G is unidentiﬁable with
two monitors, irrespective of their placement.
Second, we examine the two-monitor case in more detail
and discover that the unidentiﬁability issue only applies to
a small subset of links, and that the majority of links can be
identiﬁed under certain conditions. Speciﬁcally, given two
monitors m1 and m2, we can reorganize G into two parts3
as illustrated in Fig. 2.
Definition 1.
1) The interior graph H of G is the sub-graph obtained by re-
moving the monitors and their incident links, i.e., H := (V \
M, L \ LM ) for M = {m1, m2} and LM = L(m1) ∪ L(m2).
2) We refer to links incident to monitors, i.e., L(m1) ∪
L(m2), as exterior links, and the remaining links as inte-
rior links.
We show that the exterior links can never be identiﬁed
using two monitors (see Corollary 4.1), but the interior links
can be identiﬁed under the following conditions.

(nodes/links on the dashed border are also part of the sub-
graph, e.g., {ai}k1
j=1 in Fig. 2 are part of H),
and a solid line denotes a link/path/cycle.

Theorem 3.2. Assume that the interior graph H (with
||H|| ≥ 1) of G under a given placement of two monitors
(m1 and m2) is connected and direct link m1m2 (incident
to m1 and m2) does not exist in L(G). The necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for identifying all link metrics in H are:
1(cid:13) G − l is 2-edge-connected for every interior link l in H;
2(cid:13) G + m1m2 is 3-vertex-connected.
Third, we show that the above conditions can be naturally
extended to a necessary and suﬃcient condition for identify-
ing all link metrics in G using three or more monitors. This
condition is based on an extended graph Gex obtained from
G as follows. As illustrated in Fig. 3, given a graph G with κ
monitors, its extended graph Gex is obtained by adding two
virtual monitors m′
2, and 2κ virtual links between
each pair of virtual-actual monitors. The identiﬁability of G
is characterized by a simple condition on Gex as follows.
1 and m′
Theorem 3.3. Assume that κ (κ ≥ 3) monitors are used
to measure simple paths. The necessary and suﬃcient condi-
tion on the network topology G for identifying all link metrics
in G is that the associated extended graph Gex be 3-vertex-
connected.
Finally, we develop eﬃcient algorithms that can: (i) test
whether a given placement of monitors can identify all link
metrics, and (ii) compute a placement of the minimum num-
ber of monitors needed to identify all link metrics (see Sec-
tion 7). Both algorithms run in linear time w.r.t. network
size (i.e., O(|V (G)|+|L(G)|)) and hence are suitable for large
networks.
4. UNIDENTIFIABILITY WITH TWO
MONITORS
At least two monitors are required to identify link metrics
through monitoring simple paths. In this section, we inves-
tigate if two monitors suﬃce to identify all link metrics in
the network. Suppose that two distinct nodes are selected
to serve as monitors. Each measurement starts at one mon-
itor and terminates at the other via a controllable simple
path. The termination node then reports the end-to-end
metric, which becomes an entry in the measurement vector
c. From the perspective of graph theory, such a network can
be represented as G = ({m1, m2, v0, . . . , vk}, L), where m1
and m2 are the monitors, {v0, . . . , vk} are the non-monitors,
and |L| = n. Let m1m2 be a direct link between m1 and m2
(if it exists). Since m1m2 can be easily identiﬁed through a
one-hop measurement, we assume without loss of generality
that m1m2 /∈ L(G) (i.e., there is no direct link) in Sections
4 and 5, where only two monitors are used.
4.1 Proof of Theorem 3.1
Any G with ||G|| ≥ 2 can be reorganized as in4 Fig. 2.
Let N (v) denote the set of neighboring nodes of node v. We
deﬁne A := {a1, a2, . . . , ak1 } = N (m1) and B := {b1, b2,
. . . , bk2 } = N (m2) to be the sets of neighbors of m1 and
m2, respectively, where k1 := |A|, k2 := |B| and A, B can
overlap (m1, m2 /∈ A ∪ B).
Assuming that H is connected and all link metrics in H
are known, we can reduce any equation associated with a
simple path P between m1 and m2 to the form (see Table 1
for notations):
Wm1ai + Wbj m2 = φij
(2)
ij
for some ai ∈ A and bj ∈ B. This is obtained by rewriting
+ Wbj m2 = WPij (P ′
the original equation Wm1ai + WP ′
ij
is the segment of Pij in H) to place the unknowns on the
left-hand side, and setting φij := WPij − WP ′
. Thus, we
obtain k1 ×k2 equations from all of the simple paths between
m1 and m2, each corresponding to the sum of the metrics
of one link incident to m1 and one link incident to m2. The
corresponding reduced measurement matrix is (each column
corresponding to an unknown link metric):

linear transformations to R. For each q = 1, . . . , k1 − 1 and
i = 2, . . . , k2, replace row(qk2 + i) by row(qk2 + i) − row(i) −
row(qk2 + 1) + row(1); it can be veriﬁed that the result is a
row of zeros. Ignoring rows of zeros, R transforms into
