##### Issue Type: Feature Idea
##### Ansible Version: 1.6.2
##### Environment: Ubuntu 12.04
##### Summary:
I would like the ability to have a dependent role's status re-evaluated each
time it is called. That way, if a dependent role is called multiple times (e.g
by different dependent roles), it won't get skipped.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
When developing a set of roles for apache, I've run into this issue:  
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/Ansible-project/xcjUnfFKK6A
The basic setup of these roles is 4 different roles for apache:  
apache2 - this is the base role that contains the apache2 config, installs and
configures apache  
apache2-php - this role adds mod_php, php.ini, etc  
apache2-ssl - this role adds an SSL certificate and forces all traffic to SSL  
apache2-all - includes all of the above
This is nice because some servers only need a subset of this functionality, so
I can just include the appropriate features as needed. I've bundled these
together using role dependencies, e.g apache2-php/meta/main.yml contains the
following:
    dependencies:
      - { role: apache2 }
This is nice because then I need to only maintain the apache template file in
a single location, inside of the apache2 role, and just set variables in the
other roles if I want to add/change content on it.
This works well, except that in order for the variables to be overridden and
included together at the correct point, I have this situation in the
apache2-ssl meta/main.yml files:
    dependencies:
      - { role: apache2-php, when: include_php == True }
      - { role: apache2, when: include_php == False }
I would like to be able to add a variable that allows resetting the dependent
role's status, e.g
    dependencies:
      - { role: apache2-php, when: include_php == True }
      - { role: apache2, reset_dependents: True, when: include_php == False }
##### Expected Results:
The problem is that if include_php == False, then the first role dependency
(apache2-php), is skipped. What seems to be happening is it recursively marks
everything in the apache2 role as skipped as well, including the handler I use
to reload apache after updating the config. Then, when it arrives at the
second role dependency (apache2), it skips executing any of the handlers in
the apache2 role even if they are NOTIFIED because they were marked as skipped
previously.
Would it be possible to add a variable that would reset a role so that whether
or not it should be skipped is evaluated each time it is called (similar to
the existing allow_duplicates variable)?
##### Actual Results:
The apache2 handler that reloads the apache config is skipped (when called via
the apache2 depedent role above), even if there are changes because it was
already marked as skipped by the dependent apache2-php call (which was
skipped).
