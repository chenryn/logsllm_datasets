It would be useful to be able to use validation groups in spring MVC as
specified by JSR-303. With the improvement it should be possible to write
something like:
`@RequestMapping`("/foo", method=RequestMethod.POST)  
public void processFoo(`@Valid`(groups={Default.class,
MyValidationGroup.class}) Foo foo) { ... }

**Affects:** 3.0 RC2
**Issue Links:**
  * #11035 Support for 'groups' in addition to `@Valid` for `@MVC` Controllers ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
  * #11722 Add Group Class support to JSR-303 Validation using `@Valid` ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
  * #12504 ValidationUtils: add support for Validation group interfaces
