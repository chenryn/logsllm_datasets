It would be beneficial to incorporate validation groups in Spring MVC, as specified by JSR-303. This enhancement would enable developers to use a syntax similar to the following:

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/foo", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public void processFoo(@Validated({Default.class, MyValidationGroup.class}) Foo foo) {
    // Method implementation
}
```
