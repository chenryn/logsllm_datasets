## Abstract
Targeted attacks on civil society and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been underreported, despite these organizations being frequent targets. This paper sheds light on targeted malware attacks faced by such organizations by analyzing malicious emails received by 10 civil society organizations over a four-year period. Our study highlights the properties of malware threats and their implications for defense strategies. We find that the technical sophistication of the observed malware is relatively low, with more effort placed on social engineering. Based on this, we develop the Targeted Threat Index (TTI), a metric that incorporates both social engineering and technical sophistication to assess the risk of malware threats. We demonstrate that TTI is more effective than simple technical sophistication in identifying high-risk malware threats. We also discuss how user behavior-focused education can help prevent compromise. For two of the three Tibetan groups in our study, avoiding email attachments could reduce document-based malware threats by up to 95%.

## 1. Introduction
Civil society organizations (CSOs) working on human rights issues face various politically-motivated information security threats, including denial-of-service attacks, website defacements, and targeted malware. These campaigns are persistent, custom-designed, and conducted by highly motivated attackers aiming to extract information and monitor user activity. CSOs are particularly vulnerable due to limited resources and lack of security awareness. While targeted malware is an active research area, focused studies on CSOs are limited.

In this study, we collaborate with 10 CSOs over four years to characterize and track targeted malware campaigns. Eight of these organizations focus on China and Tibet-related human rights issues. We analyze targeted malware delivered via email, focusing on both the technical sophistication of the malware and the social engineering used to deliver it. We combine these metrics to form the Targeted Threat Index (TTI). Our unique methodology, combining qualitative and technical analysis with fieldwork and interviews, allows us to accurately rate the level of targeting and understand the relative technical sophistication of different malware families.

### Key Observations:
1. **Attachments as Primary Vector:** Over 80% of malware delivered to Tibet-related organizations is contained in email attachments. Avoiding attachments could mitigate up to 95% of threats.
2. **Low Technical Sophistication, High Social Engineering:** The technical sophistication of targeted malware is relatively low, with more effort on social engineering. This suggests that education efforts focused on changing user behavior can be effective.
3. **Persistent and Motivated Actors:** Multiple versions of malware appear over time, showing technical improvements and persistent social engineering.

We have translated these findings into a training curriculum for participating organizations, educating them on identifying suspicious email headers and using tools to check for malware.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Targeted Malware Overview
Targeted malware differs from common spam, phishing, and financially motivated malware. It is designed for specific targets, sent in lower volumes, and aimed at stealing sensitive data. The typical stages of a targeted malware attack include reconnaissance, delivery, compromise, command and control, and additional attacker actions.

### 2.2 Targeted Malware and CSOs
Targeted malware is a recognized threat to governments and businesses, but it also significantly impacts CSOs. Despite increased attention, research on targeted malware against CSOs is limited. Ethnic minority groups in China, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs, and religious groups like Falun Gong, have been frequent targets since at least 2002. The "GhostNet" cyber espionage network, uncovered by the Citizen Lab, compromised prominent Tibetan organizations and other entities globally. Other reports show similar patterns, with some including technical details on CSO-specific attacks.

## 3. Data Collection
### 3.1 Study Participants
We recruited participants through an open call on our website, outreach to known organizations, and referrals. Ten organizations participated, primarily focusing on China and Tibet-related human rights issues. Most operate from small offices, with only two having dedicated system administrators. Larger organizations have over 100 employees and enterprise-level computing infrastructures.

### 3.2 Data Sources
Our primary data source is user-submitted suspicious emails, which include full headers, file attachments, and links. Limitations include potential bias in self-reporting and the inability to verify successful compromises. We complement this with Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) alerts, website monitoring, and interviews.

### 3.3 Overview of User-Submitted Emails
The emails span four years, providing a comprehensive view of the malware threats faced by the participating organizations.

## 4. Methodology
### 4.1 Targeting and Technical Sophistication Metrics
We developed metrics to assess the targeting and technical sophistication of malware. The Targeted Threat Index (TTI) combines these metrics to provide a comprehensive threat ranking.

### 4.2 Training and Outreach Implications
Our findings have significant implications for security strategies. We have developed a training curriculum to educate organizations on identifying and mitigating targeted malware threats.

## 5. Related Work
We review related work on targeted malware and its impact on CSOs, highlighting the need for more focused studies in this area.

## 6. Conclusion
This study provides valuable insights into the nature of targeted malware threats faced by CSOs. The Targeted Threat Index (TTI) is an effective tool for assessing these threats, and our findings suggest that education and behavior change can significantly enhance security. Future work will continue to refine TTI and expand its application to other contexts.
