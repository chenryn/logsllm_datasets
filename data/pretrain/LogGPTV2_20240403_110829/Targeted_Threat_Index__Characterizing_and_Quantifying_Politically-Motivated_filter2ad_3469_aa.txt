Abstract
Targeted attacks on civil society and non-governmental
organizations have gone underreported despite the fact
that these organizations have been shown to be frequent
targets of these attacks. In this paper, we shed light on
targeted malware attacks faced by these organizations by
studying malicious e-mails received by 10 civil society
organizations (the majority of which are from groups re-
lated to China and Tibet issues) over a period of 4 years.
Our study highlights important properties of malware
threats faced by these organizations with implications on
how these organizations defend themselves and how we
quantify these threats. We ﬁnd that the technical sophis-
tication of malware we observe is fairly low, with more
effort placed on socially engineering the e-mail con-
tent. Based on this observation, we develop the Targeted
Threat Index (TTI), a metric which incorporates both so-
cial engineering and technical sophistication when as-
sessing the risk of malware threats. We demonstrate that
this metric is more effective than simple technical sophis-
tication for identifying malware threats with the high-
est potential to successfully compromise victims. We
also discuss how education efforts focused on changing
user behaviour can help prevent compromise. For two
of the three Tibetan groups in our study simple steps
such as avoiding the use of email attachments could
cut document-based malware threats delivered through
e-mail that we observed by up to 95%.

Introduction
Civil society organizations (CSOs), working on hu-
man rights issues around the globe, face a spectrum
of politically-motivated information security threats that
seek to deny (e.g. Internet ﬁltering, denial-of-service at-
tacks), manipulate (e.g. website defacements) or moni-
tor (e.g.
targeted malware) information related to their
work. Targeted malware attacks in particular are an in-
creasing problem for CSOs. These attacks are not iso-
lated incidents, but waves of attacks organized in cam-
paigns that persistently attempt to compromise systems
and gain access to networks over long periods of time
while remaining undetected. These campaigns are cus-
tom designed for speciﬁc targets and are conducted by
highly motivated attackers. The objective of these cam-
paigns is to extract information from compromised sys-
tems and monitor user activity and is best understood as
a form of espionage. CSOs can be particularly suscep-
tible to these threats due to limited resources and lack
of security awareness. Targeted malware is an active re-
search area, particularly in private industry. However,
focused studies on targeted attacks against CSOs are rel-
atively limited despite the persistent threats they face and
the vulnerability of these groups.
In this study, we work with 10 CSOs for a period of
4 years to characterize and track targeted malware cam-
paigns against these groups. With the exception of two
groups that work on human rights in multiple countries,
the remaining eight groups focus on China and Tibet-
related human rights issues. We focus on targeted mal-
ware typically delivered via e-mail that is speciﬁcally tai-
lored to these groups as opposed to conventional spam
which has been well characterized in numerous previous
works [27, 42, 45, 52, 70, 71]. We consider the threats to
these groups along two axes:
the technical sophistica-
tion of the malware as well as sophistication of the so-
cial engineering used to deliver the malicious payload.
We combine these two metrics to form an overall threat
ranking that we call the Targeted Threat Index (TTI).
While other scoring systems exist for characterizing the
level of severity and danger of a technical vulnerabil-
ity [7, 17, 41, 50], no common system exists for ranking
the sophistication of targeted e-mail attacks. TTI allows
us to gain insights into the relative sophistication of so-
cial engineering and malware leveraged against CSOs.
A key to the success of our study is a unique method-
ology, combining qualitative and technical analysis of
USENIX Association  
23rd USENIX Security Symposium  527
e-mails and their attachments with ﬁeldwork (e.g. site
visits) and interviews with affected CSOs. This method-
ology, which we describe in more detail in Section 3, al-
lows us to both accurately rate the level of targeting of e-
mail messages by interfacing with CSOs participating in
our study (Section 4.2), and understand the relative tech-
nical sophistication of different malware families used in
the attacks (Section 4.3). By combining the strengths of
our qualitative and quantitative analysis, we are able to
accurately understand trends in terms of social engineer-
ing and technical sophistication of politically-motivated
targeted malware threats faced by CSOs.
Our study makes the following observations, which
have implications for security strategies that CSOs can
employ to protect themselves from targeted malware:
Attachments are the primary vector for email based
targeted malware. More than 80% of malware deliv-
ered to Tibet-related organizations in our study and sub-
mitted to us is contained in an e-mail attachment. Fur-
ther, for 2 of the 3 Tibetan organizations in our study
(with at least 40 submitted e-mails), simply not opening
attachments would mitigate more than 95% of targeted
malware threats that use email as a vector.
Targeted malware technical sophistication is low. So-
cial engineering sophistication is high We ﬁnd that
the technical sophistication of targeted malware deliv-
ered to CSOs in our study is relatively low (e.g., rela-
tive to commercial malware that has been found targeting
CSOs and journalists [35,36,38] and conventional ﬁnan-
cially motivated malware), with much more effort given
to socially engineering messages to mislead users. This
ﬁnding highlights the potential for education efforts fo-
cused on changing user behaviours rather than high-cost
technical security solutions to help protect CSOs.
CSOs face persistent and highly motivated actors.
For numerous malware samples in our study we ob-
serve several versions of the software appearing over
the course of our four year study. These multiple ver-
sions show evidence of technical improvements to com-
plement existing social engineering techniques.
Since the start of our study we have participated in
a series of workshops with the participating Tibetan or-
ganizations to translate these results into a training cur-
riculum. Speciﬁcally, we have educated them about how
to identify suspicious e-mail headers to identify spoofed
senders and demonstrated tools that can be used to check
e-mailed links for malware and drive-by-downloads.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents relevant background on targeted malware
and attacks on CSOs. Our data collection methodology
is described in Section 3. We describe our targeting and
technical sophistication metrics as well as how we com-
bine them to produce the Targeted Threat Index (TTI)
in Section 4. Training and outreach implications of our
work are discussed in Section 5. We present related work
in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.
2 Background
2.1 Targeted Malware Overview
Targeted malware are a category of attacks that are dis-
tinct from common spam, phishing, and ﬁnancially mo-
tivated malware. Spam and mass phishing attacks are
indiscriminate in the selection of targets and are directed
to the largest number of users possible. Similarly, ﬁnan-
cially motivated malware such as banking trojans seek
to compromise as many users as possible to maximize
the potential proﬁts that can be made. The social engi-
neering tactics and themes used by these kinds of attacks
are generic and the attack vectors are sent in high vol-
umes. By contrast targeted malware attacks are designed
for speciﬁc targets, sent in lower volumes, and are moti-
vated by the objective of stealing speciﬁc sensitive data
from a target.
Targeted malware attacks typically involve the follow-
ing stages [24, 66]:
Reconnaissance: During this stage attackers conduct
research on targets including proﬁling systems, software,
and information security defenses used to identify possi-
ble vulnerabilities and contextual information on person-
nel and activities to aid social engineering.
Delivery:
During this stage a vector for delivering
the attack is selected. Common vectors include e-mails
with malicious documents or links, or contacting targets
through instant messaging services and using social en-
gineering to send malware to them. Typically, a target of
such an attack receives an e-mail, possibly appearing to
be from someone they know, containing text that urges
the user to open an attached document (or visit a web-
site).
Compromise: During this stage malicious code is exe-
cuted on a target machine typically after a user initiated
action such as opening a malicious document or link.
Command and Control: During this stage the infected
host system establishes a communications channel to a
command and control (C&C) server operated by the at-
tackers. Once this channel has been established the at-
tackers can issue commands and download further mal-
ware on to the system
Additional attacker actions: After a successful com-
promise is established, attackers can conduct a number of
actions including ex-ﬁltrating data from the infected host
and transmitting it back to attackers through a process
of encrypting, compressing, and transferring to a server

operated by the attackers. Attackers may also use pe-
ripherals such as webcams and microphones to monitor
users in real time. The infected host may also serve as
a starting point to infect other machines on the network
and seek out speciﬁc information or credentials.
2.2 Targeted Malware and CSOs
Targeted malware has become recognized by govern-
ments and businesses around the world as a serious po-
litical and corporate espionage threat. The United States
government has been particularly vocal on the threat tar-
geted malware enabled espionage poses. General Keith
Alexander, current Director of the National Security
Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Com-
mand has stated that the theft of US intellectual property
through cyber espionage constitutes the “greatest transfer
of wealth in history” [47]. Recent widely publicized tar-
geted malware intrusions against Google, RSA, the New
York Times and other high proﬁle targets have raised
public awareness around these attacks [20, 44, 48]
Despite this increased attention, targeted malware is
not a new problem, with over a decade of public reports
on these kinds of attacks [66]. However, the majority
of research on targeted malware is conducted by private
security companies who typically focus on campaigns
against industry and government entities. As a result, tar-
geted attacks on civil society and non-governmental or-
ganizations have gone underreported despite the fact that
these organizations have been shown to be frequently
targeted by cyber espionage campaigns.
In particular,
communities related to ethnic minority groups in China
including Tibetans, Uyghurs, and religious groups such
as Falun Gong have been frequent targets of cyber es-
pionage campaigns with reports dating back to at least
2002 [61].
In some cases, the same actors have been revealed to
be targeting civil society groups, government and indus-
try entities. A notable example of this was the 2009 re-
port by the Citizen Lab, a research group at the Univer-
sity of Toronto, which uncovered the “GhostNet” cyber
espionage network. GhostNet successfully compromised
prominent organizations in the Tibetan community in ad-
dition to 1,295 hosts in 103 countries, including min-
istries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organi-
zations, and news media [25]. The GhostNet case is not
an isolated example, as other reports have shown CSOs
(commonly Tibetan organizations) included as targets in
campaigns that are also directed to a range of govern-
ment and industry entities [8, 26, 28, 29, 54–56] Some of
these reports include technical details on the CSO spe-
ciﬁc attacks [26, 28, 54, 55] while others note them as a
target but do not address in detail [8, 29, 56].
While the majority of documented targeted malware
campaigns against CSOs involve China and Tibet-related
groups and potentially China-related attack operators
[9–11, 23, 25, 26, 32, 61–65, 67, 68] , these kinds of at-
tacks go beyond China. Recent research and news media
have reported attacks against large human rights groups
focused on multiple issues and countries [31, 46], and
communities related to Syria [18] and Iran [37]. Re-
searchers have also uncovered the use of commercial
network intrusion products used to target activists from
Bahrain [38], the United Arab Emirates [36], and jour-
nalists from Ethiopia [35].
3 Data collection
Since our study involves dealing with e-mail messages
which may contain personally identiﬁable information
(PII) and collection of information from CSOs who need
to maintain privacy of their data, we consulted with our
institutional research ethics board during the design of
our study. The methods described below have been sub-
mitted to and approved by this board.
3.1 Study Participants
We recruited participants via three main channels: (1)
an open call on our Web site, (2) outreach to organi-
zations we had prior relationship with and (3) referrals
from participating groups. As part of the study these
groups agreed to share technical data (e.g., e-mails with
suspicious attachments) and participate in interviews at
the onset and end of the study. Their identity and any PII
shared with us were kept strictly conﬁdential.
For the purposes of our study, we focused on organiza-
tions with missions concerning the promotion or protec-
tion of human rights. For purposes of this study, ”human
rights” means any or all of the rights enumerated under
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [60], the In-
ternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [58],
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights [59]. We also considered organizations
on a case by case basis that have a mission that does not
directly implicate human rights, but who may nonethe-
less be targeted by politically motivated digital attacks
because of work related to human rights issues (e.g., me-
dia organizations that report on human rights violations).
In total, 10 organizations participated in the study
(summarized in Table 1). The majority of these groups
work on China-related rights issues and ﬁve of these or-
ganizations focus speciﬁcally on Tibetan rights. The high
rate of participation from China and Tibet-related human
rights issues is due in part to our previous relationships
with these communities and a signiﬁcant interest and en-
thusiasm expressed by the groups.
In addition to the
China and Tibet-related groups, our study also includes

two groups, Rights Group 1 and 2 that work on multiple
human rights related issues in various countries.
The majority of organizations operate from small of-
ﬁces with less than 20 employees. Some organizations
(China Group 2, Tibet Group 2) have no physical ofﬁce
and consist of small virtual teams collaborating remotely,
often from home ofﬁces. Of these groups only two
(China Group 1, China Group 3) have a dedicated system
administrator on staff. Other groups (Tibet Groups 1-5;
China Group 2) rely on volunteers or staff with related
technical skills (e.g. Web development) to provide tech-
nical support. Rights Group 1 and Rights Group 2 are
much larger organizations relative to the others in our
sample. Both organizations have over 100 employees,
multiple ofﬁces, dedicated IT teams, and enterprise level
computing infrastructures.
3.2 Data Sources
We collect the following pieces of information from the
participant groups in order to understand the malware
threats they face:
User-submitted e-mail messages. Our primary data
source is a collection of e-mails identiﬁed by participants
as suspicious which were forwarded to a dedicated e-
mail server administered by our research team. When
available these submissions included full headers, ﬁle
attachments and / or links. There are three key limita-
tions to relying on user-submitted e-mails for our anal-
ysis. First, we are only able to study e-mails identiﬁed
by participants as suspicious, which may bias our re-
sults to only reporting threats that have been ﬂagged by
users. Further, individuals may forget to forward e-mails
in some cases. Relying on self-reporting also creates bias
between groups as individuals at different organizations
may have different thresholds for reporting, which cre-
ates difﬁculties in accurately comparing submission rates
between groups. Thus the amount of threat behaviour
we see should be considered a lower bound on what oc-
curs in practice. Second, having participants forward us
e-mails does not allow us to verify if the targeted organi-
zation was successfully compromised by the attack (e.g.,
if another member of the organization open and executed
malware on their machine) and what the scope of the at-
tack was. Finally, e-mail is only one vector that may be
used to target organizations. Other vectors include water-
hole attacks [21], denial of service attacks, or any other
vectors (e.g., physical threats like infected USB sticks).
These limitations mean that it is possible that we did not
comprehensively observe all attacks experienced by our
study groups and some more advanced attacks may have
gone unreported.
Recognizing the limitations of e-mail submissions, we
complement user submitted emails with data from Net-

work Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) alerts, web-
site monitoring, and interviews. Also, upon request of
study groups who were concerned of possible infection
we analyzed packet capture data from suspect machines.
Through the course of this supplementary analysis we
did not ﬁnd indications of malware compromise that
used samples that were not included in our pool of user-
submitted emails.
In this paper we focus on reporting
results from analyzing the user submitted emails through
the TTI. The NIDS and website monitoring components
were added later in our study and do not signiﬁcantly
contribute to TTI analysis. 1
3.3 Overview of User-Submitted E-mails
The e-mails examined in this study span over four years,
