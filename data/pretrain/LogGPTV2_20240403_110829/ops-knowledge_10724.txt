User:  Why is it said that container technology can improve the flexibility and portability of application deployment?
Assistant: Container technology can improve the flexibility and portability of application deployment because: 1. Containerization can package applications, dependencies, and configurations together, and can quickly deploy and run in different environments, avoiding code Version differences and bugs in different environments. 2. The construction and operation of the container are isolated and will not conflict with other applications or software in the host system, so multiple different applications and versions can be deployed on the same machine. 3. Container technology provides a unified management and deployment method, which facilitates managers to manage and monitor applications, and developers to test and iterate, avoiding errors and development pressure caused by environmental differences. 4. Container technology is standardized, follows open standards and common technologies, can run on various development languages and platforms, and supports cross-cloud and cross-platform operation, which improves the portability and maintainability of applications.
