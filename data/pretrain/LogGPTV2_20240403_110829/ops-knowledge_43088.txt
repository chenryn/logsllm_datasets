User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: Even after following the instructions from the valuable answers above, calling python from the command line would open the Microsoft Store and redirect me to a page to download the software. 
I discovered this was caused by a 0 Ko python.exe file in AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps which was taking precedence over my python executable in my PATH. 
Removing this folder from my PATH solved it.
