Repro:
  * Use "View/Toggle Menu Bar" to hide the menu bar
  * Press and release "alt", the menu bar appears
  * Try using the arrow keys or mnemonic keys ('F' for 'File' menu)
Actual: there is no way to interact with the menu bar from the keyboard  
Expected: same as the Hide Menu Bar extension for VS, where pressing alt gives
keyboard focus to the "file menu", which allows navigating with the keyboard
arrows or mnemonic keys.
