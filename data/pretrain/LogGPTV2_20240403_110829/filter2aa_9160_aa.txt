# dkdos
Reversing, 45 points
## Description
> I've sent my KIPODIM shop to a friend of mine, and he told me he was able to access it with just a random password. Can you please check it?
A binary file was attached.
## Solution
Let's check the file:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/kaf/dkdos# file dkdos.exe
dkdos.exe: MS-DOS executable
```
It's a DOS executable, we can run it with DOSBox-X (which is a DOSBox port with a better debugger):

We need to provide the correct password. Let's open the file with Radare2 and start disassembling. We'll go into a little more details than usual since DOS reversing isn't so common these days.
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/kaf/dkdos# r2 dkdos.exe

[0000:0050]> afl
0x00000050   53 425  -> 459  entry0
0x00000021    1 8            fcn.00000021
0x00000029    1 15           fcn.00000029
0x00000038    4 24           fcn.00000038
```
We start from the main function:
```
[0000:0050]> s entry0
[0000:0050]> e asm.comments = false
[0000:0050]> e graph.comments = false
[0000:0050]> afu 0000:00b6
```
(The `afu` command is needed since Radare2 doesn't correctly understand that the main function ends at `0000:00b4`, and comments are disabled since Radare2 gets them wrong for this binary, incorrectly referencing strings). 
Let's take a look at it:
```
