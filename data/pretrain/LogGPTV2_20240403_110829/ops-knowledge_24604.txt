User: I want to access files in my local machine by using urls. For example "file:///usr/local/home/thapaliya/constants.py". What would be the best way to achieve this?
Assistant: keep the files in a some folder which you want to access from a localhost

In command prompt go to that location and type
python -m http.server 8080

now type localhost :8080 in browser you will able to access files in that folder

if u want to use some js files for paticular html files then
<script src="http://localhost:8080/main.js"</script>
make sure you run this program on another port
