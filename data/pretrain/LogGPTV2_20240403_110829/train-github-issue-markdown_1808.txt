While doing tests sometimes I felt some test are too easy and others quite
hard to solve. For some of them I could imagine, they are better split up into
more tests to need better explanation. The goal might be to develop a more
_even_ learning curve or possibly add better links to external resources.
How about adding a small optional survey after each test like:
**Was it easy or difficult to solve this test?**
  * Too Easy
  * Ok
  * Too Difficult
This way you could determine which exercises may need more explanation or
might be _boring_?
