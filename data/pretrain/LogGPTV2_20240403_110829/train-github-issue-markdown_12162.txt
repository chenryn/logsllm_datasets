On Windows, the menu's behavior does not align well with native expectations. Specifically, when pressing the Alt key, the first menu item ("File") should be selected, but this is not occurring. Additionally, navigation between menu items using the Left or Right Arrow keys is not functional. However, the Up and Down Arrow keys do work for navigating within a single menu.
