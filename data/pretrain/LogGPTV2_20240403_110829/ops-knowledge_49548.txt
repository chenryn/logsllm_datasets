User: Please briefly describe token passing technology and how to configure it in windows domain
Assistant: Token passing technology is a technology used to realize cross-server authentication in Windows domain environment. It allows a user to obtain a token (or license) through a domain controller after logging in to the domain controller, and then use the token for authentication across domain controllers and servers. These servers can be in the same domain or in different domains. To configure token passing in a Windows domain, the following steps are required: 1. On the domain controller, open Group Policy Manager and create a new Group Policy Object (GPO). 2. In GPO, navigate to Computer Configuration→Windows Settings→Security Settings→Local Policies→Security Options. 3. Locate the "Enable Delegation" policy option and set it to "Enabled". 4. After enabling delegation, you need to add the correct delegation permissions for the servers that need to pass tokens. In Active Directory Users and Computers Administrator Console (ADUC), right-click the desired computer, select Properties, and go to the Delegation tab. 5. On the Delegation tab, select Custom and select Delegate authentication on this computer, and then add the desired service to the Services you can trust for delegation list. 6. Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect. The above are the basic steps to configure token passing technology in Windows domain. It should be noted that token passing technology needs to be carefully configured to ensure security. Before configuring, please make sure to read the relevant documentation carefully and follow best practices.
