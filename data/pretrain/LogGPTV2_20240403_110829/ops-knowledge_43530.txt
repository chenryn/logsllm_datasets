Question: "In an Android device with a TrustZone-based Keymaster implementation that does not support key expiration, how does the Keystore system handle an attempt to use a key after its expiration date?"
 "A": "The secure hardware enforces the expiration and any cryptographic operation fails."
 "B": "The TrustZone-based implementation ignores the expiration date and allows the key usage."
 "C": "Keystore implements software-based enforcement, rejecting attempts to use the key after expiration."
 "D": "The key expiration is not enforced at all, and the key can be used without restrictions."
Answer: C
