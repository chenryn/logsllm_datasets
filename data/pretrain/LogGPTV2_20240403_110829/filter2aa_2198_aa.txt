**THE GRAND JURY CHARGES THAT:**

**GENERAL ALLEGATIONS**

At all times relevant to this Superseding Indictment:

1. **KIM DOTCOM, MEGAUPLOAD LIMITED, VESTOR LIMITED, FINN BATATO, JULIUS BENCKO, SVEN ECHTERNACH, MATHIAS ORTMANN, ANDRUS NOMM, and BRAM VAN DER KOLK, the defendants, and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, were members of the "Mega Conspiracy," a worldwide criminal organization. The Mega Conspiracy engaged in extensive criminal copyright infringement and money laundering, causing an estimated harm to copyright holders exceeding $500,000,000 and generating reported income in excess of $175,000,000.**

2. **Megaupload.com is a commercial website and service operated by the Mega Conspiracy, which reproduces and distributes unauthorized copies of popular copyrighted content over the Internet. Since at least September 2005, Megaupload.com has been used by the defendants and other members and associates of the Mega Conspiracy to willfully reproduce and distribute millions of infringing copies of copyrighted works, including motion pictures, television programs, musical recordings, electronic books, images, video games, and other computer software. Over more than five years, the Mega Conspiracy expanded its operations into numerous related Internet businesses, which are directly connected or financially dependent on the criminal activities associated with Megaupload.com.**

3. **Megaupload.com was once estimated to be the 13th most frequently visited website on the Internet. The site claims to have had over one billion visitors, more than 180,000,000 registered users, an average of 50 million daily visits, and to account for approximately four percent of total Internet traffic. As of January 19, 2012, there were approximately 66.6 million users registered in the Mega Conspiracy's internal database records, of which only 5.86 million users had ever uploaded a single file to either Megaupload.com or Megavideo.com.**

4. **Megaupload.com's primary sources of income are premium subscriptions and online advertising. Premium subscriptions, available for as little as a few dollars per day or up to approximately $260 for a lifetime, provide fast reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted works from servers located around the world. Premium users, who represent a small percentage of the overall user base, can download and upload files with minimal limitations. Subscription fees collected from premium users during the existence of the Mega Conspiracy are estimated to exceed $150 million. Online advertising, heavily dependent on the popularity of infringing content, has generated more than $25 million for the Mega Conspiracy.**

5. **The financial proceeds from Megaupload.com were primarily directed to four areas. First, the bulk of the revenues went to the defendants, corporate entities they control, other co-conspirators, and employees for their commercial advantage and private financial gain. Second, the Mega Conspiracy spent millions developing and promoting Megaupload.com and complementary sites such as Megavideo.com, Megaclick.com, Megaporn.com, and others (collectively, the "Mega Sites"). Third, the Mega Conspiracy offered an "Uploader Rewards" Program, which promised cash and other financial incentives to premium subscribers who uploaded popular works, including copyrighted works, to servers under the Mega Conspiracy's control. This program aimed to increase the number of visitors and premium users, thereby increasing revenue. In total, the Mega Conspiracy paid millions of dollars directly to uploaders through online payments. Fourth, the Mega Conspiracy spends millions of dollars per month on infrastructure support, including leasing computers, hosting charges, and Internet bandwidth. Unlike legitimate distributors, Megaupload.com does not make significant payments to the copyright owners of the many thousands of works reproduced and distributed on the Mega Sites.**

6. **Any Internet user can upload a file to Megaupload.com. Once a user selects a file and clicks the "upload" button, Megaupload.com reproduces the file on at least one server it controls and provides the user with a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL) link. For example, a link distributed on December 3, 2006, by defendant DOTCOM (www.megaupload.com/?d=BYl5XE3V) links to a musical recording by U.S. recording artist "50 Cent." Clicking the link accesses a Megaupload.com download page, allowing any Internet user to download the file from a server controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.**

7. **Megaupload.com advertises itself as a "cyberlocker," a private data storage provider. However, the design of the service limits long-term private storage. Unregistered anonymous users (referred to as "Non-Members") can upload and download content, but any Non-Member-uploaded content that is not downloaded within 21 days is permanently deleted. Registered free users (or "Members") can also upload and download content, but each uploaded file must be downloaded every 90 days to remain on the system. Only premium users have a realistic chance of long-term private storage, as their files are not regularly deleted due to non-use. In contrast, when any type of user uploads a popular file that is repeatedly downloaded, including infringing copies of copyrighted works, that file remains on Mega Conspiracy-controlled servers and is available for distribution by anyone with an active link.**

8. **To facilitate the mass distribution of content, the Mega Conspiracy created a computer system architecture that keeps the most frequently downloaded files in memory on high-end servers located at two facilities belonging to a leading broadband provider. The vast majority of these files are infringing copies of copyrighted works, and the Mega Conspiracy has prioritized their rapid and repeated distribution.**

9. **When a user clicks on a Megaupload.com download link, they are typically brought to a download page containing online advertisements provided by the Conspiracy. Each download generates financial gain for the Conspiracy, tied directly to the download. The more popular the content, such as well-known copyrighted works, the more users visit the download page, increasing the Mega Conspiracy's revenue. Since only about one percent of Megaupload.com users pay for premium access, the Conspiracy's business strategy focuses on maximizing the number of downloads, which is inconsistent with the concept of private storage.**

10. **In addition to displaying advertisements, Megaupload.com's download pages are designed to increase premium subscriptions. Non-premium users are encouraged to buy a premium subscription to reduce wait and download times, which can be at least an hour for popular content. Users are also prompted to view videos uploaded to Megaupload.com using a proprietary player on Megavideo.com and to generate new links to import into their own Megaupload.com accounts, facilitating further distribution.**

11. **Content on Megaupload.com is not searchable on the website, concealing the scope of its infringement. Instead, the Mega Conspiracy relies on third-party "linking" sites, which contain user-generated postings of links created by Megaupload.com and other Mega Sites. While the Conspiracy may not operate these sites, it provided financial incentives for premium users to post links through the "Uploader Rewards" program, ensuring widespread distribution of Megaupload.com links and an inventory of popular content on the Mega Conspiracy's servers. These linking sites, which are well-organized and easy to use, promote and direct users to Mega Conspiracy download pages, enabling the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted works.**

12. **Popular linking sites that contained Mega Conspiracy-generated links include: niniavideo.net, megaupload.net, megarelease.net, kino.to, alluc.org, peliculasvonkis.com, seriesvonkis.com, surfthechannel.com, taringa.net, thepiratecity.org, and mulinks.com. While some of these websites exclusively offer Megaupload.com links, all maintain an index of URL links to identified copies of copyrighted content stored on servers controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.**

13. **The Mega Conspiracy closely monitors traffic from linking sites to the Mega Sites, aware that these sites generate a significant portion of the millions of weekly visits to its websites and services, providing direct financial benefits through advertising revenue and opportunities for new premium subscriptions.**

14. **Members of the Mega Conspiracy have knowingly interacted with users of linking sites and visited these sites themselves. Some defendants have instructed individual users on how to locate links to infringing content on the Mega Sites, recommending specific linking websites. Several defendants have also shared comments from Mega Site users demonstrating their use or attempted use of the sites to obtain infringing copies of copyrighted content.**

15. **Unlike the public, who must rely on third-party indexes, members of the Conspiracy have full access to the listings of actual files stored on their servers and the generated links to those files. Conspirators have searched the internal database for themselves and their associates to directly access copyright-infringing content on servers controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.**

16. **While the public-facing Megaupload.com website does not allow searches, it lists its "Top 100 files," which includes freely available motion picture trailers and software trials. This list, however, does not accurately reflect the most popular downloads on Megaupload.com, making the website appear more legitimate and hiding the popular copyright-infringing content that drives its revenue.**

17. **If a user uploads a video file to Megaupload.com, they can use the provided URL link to redirect others to Megavideo.com, where the file can be viewed using a "Flash" video player. Alternatively, a user can embed the Megavideo.com player into their own website to display the video file and provide advertising content from the Mega Conspiracy. Megavideo.com has been estimated to be as popular as the 52nd most frequently visited website on the Internet.**

18. **A non-premium user is limited to watching 72 minutes of any given video on Megavideo.com, providing a significant incentive for users seeking infringing copies of motion pictures to pay the Mega Conspiracy for premium access. Some premium users, therefore, pay the Mega Conspiracy directly for access to infringing copies of copyrighted works.**

19. **Before any video can be viewed on Megavideo.com, the user must view an advertisement. Initially, the Mega Conspiracy contracted with companies such as adBrite, Inc., Google AdSense, and PartyGaming plc for advertising. Currently, the Conspiracy's own advertising website, Megaclick.com, is used to set up advertising campaigns on all the Mega Sites. The high traffic volume allows the Conspiracy to charge advertisers upfront and at a higher rate than other popular Internet advertising companies. The popularity of infringing content on the Mega Sites has generated more than $25 million in online advertising revenues for the Conspiracy.**

20. **Like Megaupload.com, Megavideo.com conceals many of the infringing copies of popular copyrighted videos available on and distributed by the site. Megavideo.com purports to provide both browse and search functions, but searching for a full-length copyrighted video will not produce results. Browsing the front page of Megavideo.com does not show any obviously infringing copies; instead, it contains news stories, user-generated videos, and general Internet videos similar to YouTube. However, browsing the most-viewed videos in the Entertainment category has sometimes revealed a number of infringing copies of copyrighted works available from Mega Conspiracy-controlled servers.**

21. **Members of the Conspiracy have publicly stated that they operate the Mega Sites in compliance with the notice and takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), codified at Title 17, United States Code, Section 512. However, they do not meet the criteria for safe harbor under the DMCA because they willfully infringe copyrights, have actual knowledge of infringing materials, receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity, and fail to remove or disable access to known infringing material from servers they control.**

22. **Members of the Mega Conspiracy negotiated the use of an "Abuse Tool" with some major U.S. copyright holders to purportedly remove infringing material from Mega Conspiracy-controlled servers. The Abuse Tool allowed copyright holders to enter specific URL links to infringing content, and the Mega Conspiracy would then remove or disable access to those links.**
