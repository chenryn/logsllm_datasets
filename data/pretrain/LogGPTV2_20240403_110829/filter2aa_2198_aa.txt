THE GRAND JURY CHARGES THAT:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
At all times relevant to this Superseding Indictment:
1.
KIM DOTCOM, MEGAUPLOAD LIMITED, VESTOR LIMITED, FINN
BATATO, JULIUS BENCKO, SVEN ECHTERNACH, MATHIAS ORTMANN, ANDRUS
NOMM, and BRAM VAN DER KOLK, the defendants, and others known and unknown to the
Grand Jury, were members ofthe "Mega Conspiracy," a worldwide criminal organization whose
members engaged in criminal copyright infringement and money laundering on a massive scale
with estimatedharm to copyrightholders well in excessof$500,000,000 and reportedincome in
excess of $175,000,000.
2.
Megaupload.comis a commercialwebsite and service operated by the Mega
Conspiracy that reproduces and distributes copies of popular copyrighted content over the
Internet without authorization. Since at least September 2005, Megaupload.com has been used
by the defendants and other members and associates ofthe Mega Conspiracyto willfully
reproduceand distributemany millions of infringing copies of copyrightedworks, including
motion pictures, television programs, musical recordings, electronic books, images, video games,
and other computer software. Over the more than five years ofits existence, the Mega
Conspiracy has aggressively expanded its operations into a large number ofrelated Internet
businesses, which are connected directly to, or at least financially dependent upon, the criminal
conduct associated with Megaupload.com.
3.
Megaupload.com was at one point in its history estimated to be the 13th most
frequently visited website on the entire Internet. The site claims to have had more than one
billion visitors in its history, more than 180,000,000 registered users to date, an average of
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 2 of 90 PageID# 247
50 million daily visits, and to account for approximately four percent ofthe total traffic on
the Internet. As ofJanuary 19, 2012, there were actually approximately 66.6 million users
registered in the Mega Conspiracy's internal database records; ofthese registered users, the
records furthershow that, at most, only 5.86 million users had ever uploaded a single file to
either Megaupload.com or Megavideo.com.
4.
Megaupload.com's income comes primarily from two sources: premium
subscriptions and onlineadvertising. Premium subscriptions for Megaupload.com have been
availablefor onlinepurchasefor as little as a few dollarsper day or as much as approximately
$260 for a lifetime. In exchange for payment, the Mega Conspiracy provides the fast
reproductionand distributionof infringingcopies of copyrightedworks from its computer
servers located around the world. Premium users ofthe site, a small percentage ofthe overall
user base, are able to download and upload files with few, ifany, limitations. Subscription fees
collected during the existence ofthe Mega Conspiracy from premium users are estimated to be
more than $150 million. Online advertising on Megaupload.com and its associated websites,
which is heavily dependent on the popularity ofcopyright infringing content to attract website
visits, has further obtainedmore than $25 million for the Mega Conspiracy.
5.
The financial proceeds ofMegaupload.com have been primarily directed to four
sources. First, the Conspiracy has directed the bulkof its revenues to the defendants, corporate
entitiesthey control, otherco-conspirators, and employees for their commercial advantage and
privatefinancial gain. Second, the Mega Conspiracy has spent millionsof dollars developing
and promoting Megaupload.com and complementary Internet sites and services, such as
Megavideo.com, Megaclick.com, Megaporn.com, and a host of others (collectively the "Mega
Sites"). Third, for much ofits operation, the Mega Conspiracy has offered an "Uploader
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 3 of 90 PageID# 248
Rewards" Program, which promised premium subscribers transfers of cash and other financial
incentives to upload popular works, including copyrighted works, to computer servers under the
Mega Conspiracy's direct control and for the Conspiracy's ultimate financial benefit. The more
popular content that was present on Mega Conspiracy servers would increase the number of
visitors and premiumusersthat the Conspiracy could monetize. In total, the MegaConspiracy
directlypaid uploadersmillionsof dollarsthroughonline payments. Fourth, the Mega
Conspiracyspendsmillionsofdollarsper month on the infrastructuresupportingtheir
businesses, including the leasing ofcomputers, hosting charges, and Internet bandwidth. In
contrast to legitimate Internet distributors ofcopyrighted content, Megaupload.com does not
make any significant payments to the copyright owners ofthe many thousands ofworks that are
willfully reproduced and distributed on the Mega Sites each and every day.
6.
Any Internetuser who goes to the Megaupload.comwebsite can upload a
computerfile. Oncethat user has selecteda file on their computer and clicks the "upload"
button, Megaupload.com reproduces the file on at least one computer server it controls and
provides the uploading user with a unique Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") link that allows
anyone with the link to download the file. For example, a link distributed on December 3,2006
by defendant DOTCOM (www.megaupload.com/?d=BYl5XE3V) linksto a musical recording
by U.S.recording artist"50 Cent." A singleclick on the link accessesa Megaupload.com
downloadpage that allowsany Internetuser to downloada copy ofthe file from a computer
server that is controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.
7.
Megaupload.com advertises itselfas a "cyberlocker," which is a private data
storage provider. However, as part ofthe design ofthe service, the vast majority of
Megaupload.com users do not have significant capabilities to store private content long-term.
4
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 4 of 90 PageID# 249
Unregistered anonymous users (referred to as "Non-Members" by the Conspiracy) are allowed to
upload and download content files, but any Non-Member-uploaded content that is not
downloaded within 21 days is permanently deleted. Similarly, registered free users (or
"Members") are allowed to upload and download content files, but each uploaded file must be
downloaded every 90 days in order to remain on the system. Only premium users have a
realistic chance ofhaving any private long-term storage, since their files are not regularly deleted
due to non-use. In contrast, when any type ofuser on Megaupload.com uploads a copy ofa
popular file that is repeatedly downloaded, includinginfringingcopies ofcopyrighted works
available for download,that file remains on Mega Conspiracy-controlledcomputers and is
available for distribution by anyone who can locate an active link to the file.
8.
Furthermore, in order to mass distribute copies ofthe works on the systems it
controls,the Mega Conspiracy has createda computer systemarchitecturethat keeps its most
frequently downloadedfiles in memory(rather than in storage)on a number ofdedicatedhigh-
end computer servers that are located at two facilities that belong to one ofthe leading broadband
providers in the world. The vastmajority of the files on these computers are infringing copies of
copyrightedworks, and the Mega Conspiracy has purposefullymade their rapid andrepeated
distribution a primary focus oftheir infrastructure.
9.
Once a user clicks on a Megaupload.comdownload link, the user is generally
brought to a download page for the file. The download page contains online advertisements
providedby the Conspiracy, which meansthat everydownloadon Megaupload.com provides a
financial gain to the Conspiracy that is directly tied to the download. The more popular the
content, such as copiesofwell-knowncopyrightedworks, the more users that find their way to a
Megaupload.comdownloadpage; the access ofthese additional users, in turn, makesthe Mega
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 5 of 90 PageID# 250
Conspiracymore money. Becauseapproximately one percent ofMegaupload.com users pay for
their use of the systems,Mega Conspiracy's businessstrategy for advertisingrequires
maximizingthe number ofonline downloads(i.e., distributions ofcontent), which is also
inconsistent with the concept ofprivate storage.
10.
In additionto displaying online advertisements, the downloadpages on
Megaupload.com are designedto increase premiumsubscriptions. All non-premium usersare
encouraged to buy a premium subscription to decrease wait and download times, which can be at
least an hourfor popularcontent(and,for someperiodsoftime, theseusers havebeen ineligible
to download filesovera certain size). As a result, non-premium usersare repeatedly asked by
the Conspiracy to pay for more and faster access to content on Megaupload.com. Users are also
promptedto viewvideosuploaded to Megaupload.com directlyon a proprietary playerdesigned
by the Conspiracy and offered through the Megavideo.com website and service. Users have also
been askedif they want to generate a new link to the downloading file and importit to theirown
Megaupload.comaccounts, which facilitates distribution that is again inconsistent with
private storage.
11.
The content availablefrom Megaupload.com is not searchableon the website,
which allows theMega Conspiracy to conceal the scope of its infringement. Instead of hosting a
searchfunction on its own site,theMegaConspiracy business modelpurposefully relieson
thousands ofthird party "linking" sites, which contain user-generated postings oflinks created
by Megaupload.com (as well as those createdby other Mega Sites, includingMegavideo.com
and Megaporn.com). Whilethe Conspiracy may not operatethese third partysites,the Mega
Conspiracy didprovide financial incentives forpremium usersto post linkson linking sites
through the "Uploader Rewards" program, which ensured widespread distribution of
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 6 of 90 PageID# 251
Megaupload.com links throughout the Internetand an inventory ofpopular content on the Mega
Conspiracy's computer servers. These linkingsites, which are usually well organizedand easy
to use, promoteand direct users to Mega Conspiracydownload pages that allow the reproduction
and distribution ofinfringing copies ofcopyrighted works.
12.
Popular linking sites that contained Mega Conspiracy-generated links include:
niniavideo.net, megaupload.net, megarelease.net, kino.to, alluc.org, peliculasvonkis.com.
seriesvonkis.com, surfthechannel.com, taringa.net, thepiratecitv.org, and mulinks.com. While
several ofthese websites exclusively offer Megaupload.com links, all maintained an index of
URL links to identified copies ofcopyrighted contentthat were stored on serversdirectly
controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.
13.
TheMegaConspiracy closely monitors the traffic from linkingsitesto the Mega
Sitesand services. The Conspiracy is awarethat linkingsites generatea very highpercentage of
the millions ofvisits to its websites and services each week and provide the Conspiracy direct
financial benefits throughadvertising revenue and opportunities for new premiumsubscriptions.
14.
Members ofthe Mega Conspiracy have knowingly interacted with users of
linking sitesandvisitedthe sites (and associated online forums) themselves. Specifically, some
ofthe defendants have instructed individual users how to locate links to infringing content on the
Mega Sites (including recommending specific linking websites). Several ofthe defendants have
also shared witheach other commentsfrom Mega Site users demonstratingthat they have used
or are attempting to use the Mega Sites to get infringing copies ofcopyrighted content.
15.
In contrast to the public who is required to significantly rely on third party
indexes, members ofthe Conspiracy have full access to the listings ofactual files that are stored
on their servers (as well as the Megaupload.com- and Megavideo.com- and Megaporn.com-
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 7 of 90 PageID# 252
generated links to those files). Conspirators have searched the internal database for their
associates and themselves so that they may directly access copyright-infringing content on
servers controlled by the Mega Conspiracy.
16.
Though the public-facing Megaupload.com website itselfdoes not allow searches,
it does list its "Top 100 files", which includes motion picture trailers and software trials that are
freely available on the Internet. The Top 100 list, however, does not actually portray the most
popular downloads on Megaupload.com, which makes the website appear more legitimate and
hides the popular copyright-infringing content that drives its revenue.
17.
If a user uploadsa video file to Megaupload.com. the user can utilize the provided
URL link to redirect others to another Mega Conspiracy-controlled website, Megavideo.com.
where they can view the file using a "Flash" video player. Alternatively, a user who hosts a
personal or commercial website can embed the Megavideo.com player into their own website to
displaythe video file (and provide advertising content from the Mega Conspiracy).
Megavideo.com has been estimated to be as popular as the 52nd most frequently visited website
on the entire Internet.
18.
A non-premiumuser is limitedto watching 72 minutes ofany given video on
Megavideo.com at a time, which, since nearly all commercial motionpictures exceed that length,
provides a significant incentive for users who are seeking infringing copies ofmotion pictures to
paythe MegaConspiracy a feefor premium access.
Somepremium usersare,therefore, paying
the Mega Conspiracy directly for access to infringing copies ofcopyrighted works.
19.
Before any video can be viewed on Megavideo.com. the user must view an
advertisement. Originally, the Mega Conspiracy had contracted with companies such as
adBrite, Inc., Google AdSense, and PartyGaming pic for advertising. Currently, the
8
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 8 of 90 PageID# 253
Conspiracy's own advertising website, Megaclick.com. is used to set up advertising
campaigns on all the Mega Sites. The high traffic volume on the Conspiracy websites allows
the Conspiracy to chargeadvertisersup-frontand at a higher rate than would be achievedby
the percentage-per-click methodologyused by other popular Internet advertisingcompanies.
The popularity ofthe infringing content on the Mega Sites has generated more than $25 million
in online advertising revenues for the Conspiracy.
20.
Like Megaupload.com,Megavideo.comconceals many ofthe infringing copies of
popular copyrighted videos that are available on and distributed by the site and the associated
service. Megavideo.com does purport to provide both browse and search functions, but any
user's search on Megavideo.com for a full length copyrighted video (which can be downloaded
from a Mega Conspiracy-controlled server somewhere in the world) will not produce any results.
Similarly, browsing the front page ofMegavideo.com does not show any obviously infringing
copies ofany copyrighted works; instead, the page contains videos ofnews stories, user-
generated videos, and general Internet videos in a manner substantially similar to Youtube.com.
Browsing the most-viewed videos in the Entertainment category on Megavideo.com.
however, has at times revealed a number ofinfringing copies of copyrighted works that are
available from Mega Conspiracy-controlled servers and are amongst the most viewed materials
being offered.
21.
Members of the Conspiracyhave publicly stated that they operate the Mega Sites
in compliance with the notice and takedown provisions ofthe Digital Millennium Copyright
Act ("DMCA"), codified at Title 17, United States Code, Section 512, despite the fact that they
are violating its provisions. Internet providers gain a safe harbor under the DMCA from civil
copyright infringement suits in the United States ifthey meet certain criteria. The members of
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 9 of 90 PageID# 254
Mega Conspiracy do not meet these criteria1 because they are willfully infringing copyrights
themselves on these systems; haveactualknowledge thatthe materials on theirsystems are
infringing (oralternatively knowfacts or circumstances thatwouldmake infringing material
apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to copyright-infringing activity where
the provider can control that activity; and have not removed, or disabled access to, known
copyright infringing material from servers they control.
22.
Members ofthe Mega Conspiracy negotiated the use ofan "Abuse Tool" with
somemajorU.S.copyright holders to purportedly remove copyright-infringing material from
Mega Conspiracy-controlled servers. The Abuse Tool allowed copyrightholders to enter
specific URL links to copyright infringing content of which theywere aware, andtheywere
