MAC addresses are synchronously changing (assuming sufﬁ-
cient group membership), tracking can be achieved. This attack
requires collusion of multiple APs and Wi-Fi or equivalent
communications mechanisms. This may be impractical to set
up exclusive of the most sophisticated attackers.
B. Hybrid Attacks
There are a number of works [20–26] that combine WLSS
data with motion/inertial sensors to infer user location, mode
of transit, orientation and behavior. Of those surveyed, we ﬁnd
best case accuracies near 80%. Although positional accuracy
beneﬁts offered by these mechanisms are interesting, these
attacks generally require obtaining a ’ﬁx’ via WLSS function-
ality prior to leveraging sensor data. This exposes the attacker
to WLSS discovery mechanisms.
Zhang et al. [27] developed the SensTrack system which
identiﬁes turning points using a smartphone’s accelerometer
to determine speed, distance, and orientation. Additionally,
they use sensors with adaptive Wi-Fi and GPS switching to
address location contexts where GPS is less effective (i.e.
indoor locations). Their system achieved prediction errors of
nominally 3.128 meters versus 5 for good GPS signal strength.
This approach assumes some location predetermination using
GPS for initial reference position. Furthermore,
the short
distances within a building do not offer the challenges one
realizes in the spatial-temporal context of driving a vehicle.
C. Sensor Only Attacks
The following attacks are most representative of our ap-
proach as they rely entirely on zero-permission sensor sources.
Han et al. [28] suggested a method of location inference
using the accelerometer and magnetometer. Leveraging a prob-
abilistic dead reckoning method called Probabilistic Inertial
Navigation (ProbIN), they mapped probability of displacement
to probability of motion. Training data associates sensor data
with map truth. Resolution is observed approaching 200 me-
ters, the length of a typical city block. Their small sample

size limited the experimental path length range to between
1 km and 9.7 km. Although claiming better accuracy than
achievable using Wi-Fi or cellular techniques, their approach
greatly depends on acquiring training data which may present a
resource challenge (i.e. time and labor) in large scale scenarios.
In Nawaz et al. [29], the authors demonstrate that a smart-
phone’s accelerometer and gyroscope can be used to identify
‘signiﬁcant’ journeys independent of phone orientation and
trafﬁc. This is because gyroscope signatures obtained from
multiple journeys of the same route exhibit similar patterns
that differ only in amplitude and time compression or ex-
pansion. They apply Dynamic Time Warping to calculate
the distance between various journeys and use a k-medoids
clustering approach to cluster similar routes together. A route
is labeled as signiﬁcant if it is traveled more times than a
predeﬁned threshold. They test this technique for two cities
using 43 real driving experiments and showed that the routes
were accurately clustered in 8 clusters deﬁned for the two
cities. Grid road networks are addressed in a different manner.
Here, they depend on turn count as a uniqueness metric and
suggest that their technique is effective for reasonably long
routes because such routes exhibit a unique sequence of turns
even when individual turns are similar.
In Zhou et al. [30], the authors describe a novel technique
that analyzes verbal directions provided by a GPS based
navigation app. Using a second zero-permissions app, they
measure speaker on/off times controlled by the navigation app.
The attacker can infer which course a driver took due to the
duration of these audible driving instructions. Permission for
speaker usage is not required as of this writing. Associating
talk time to an off-board synthesized instruction driving set
yields a 30% false positive rate over a small sample size (7
out of 10 correct). This approach requires the use of a voice
enabled navigation system. Furthermore, it assumes that the
navigation app is trustworthy.
Michalevsky et al. [10] introduce a power based scheme
that distinguishes a user route from a set of possible routes
in real-time. Furthermore, they attempt to infer new routes by
constructing projected route power proﬁles that are aggregated
from shorter, known segment power proﬁles, all using 3G
networks. With a ’modest’ number of applications running,
they achieve accurate results in 2/3 of the scenarios while the
results degrade to an accuracy of 1/5 with additional active
applications such as Facebook and Skype. In addition, they are
limited by the need to provide data to the learning machine
which itself limits scalability in obtaining training data.
D. Behavior Analysis
This research area involves determining user modality from
smartphone sensors. For example, ergonomic/activity identi-
ﬁcation is discussed in [31]. The authors use learned data
from walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing to
ascertain user activity. They identiﬁed and collected data for 43
features from a 29 person sample set. Raw data was evaluated
using the WEKA data mining tool suite to develop decision
tree, logistic and regression and multilayer neural network
models. Excluding motions associated with moving up and
down stairs, the method can identify activity nearly 90% of
the time. Although of a single modality and reasonably well
suited for human activity identiﬁcation, is has limited ability
to ascertain paths with much less start and stop points.
Lee and Mase [32] studied the feasibility of detecting user
behavior such as sitting, standing, walking on level ground,
going up or down a stairway as well as determining the number
of steps taken to infer a person’s location in an indoor envi-
ronment. They developed a system using the accelerometer
and gyroscope sensors to measure the forward and upward
acceleration and angle of the user’s legs. In addition, the
compass is used to determine the direction of movement. The
phone is mounted on different body locations and a dead-
reckoning method is applied to estimate the user’s physical
location. The authors show that their system efﬁciently calcu-
lated the number of steps and location for eight individuals,
using a predeﬁned database of selected locations in an ofﬁce
environment. They claim a high recognition ratio of 91.8% for
ten unique location transitions.
E. Other Works of Interest
Two additional works are noteworthy. They include a pattern
matching/machine vision approach to path traversal tracking
and a framework to measure the effectiveness of the attack.
In terms of matching shapes, patterns and contours, there are
numerous examples in the literature. We identify one here for
this discussion. Kupeev et al. [33] decomposed shape contours
in terms of segments for purposes of determining similarity
of contours. They were able to analyze 24 shape distances
with 32 unique quantized rotation angles against one another.
The error rate appeared to be less than 10%. Of importance
is the limited use of this technique observed in the location
privacy space. This approach’s weaknesses are similar to other
contour matching solutions in that the subtle differences in
road contours may not be distinguishable between similar yet
geographically separate roads.
In Shokri et al. [34], the authors suggest a framework for
scoring location privacy protection mechanisms. Here, they
deﬁne a triad taxonomy of accuracy, certainty and correctness
where the later represents the metric that determines the
privacy of user. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
attempt at establishing an evaluation framework. Although not
utilized in this work, it provides a foundation for evaluating
in the future, our results when compared with truth.
VIII. CONCLUSION
We modeled the problem of tracking vehicular users as the
problem of identifying the most likely route on a graph derived
from the city’s roads public database. The performance results
of our algorithms, both simulations and experimental, indicate
that in most cities a signiﬁcant number of users are vulnerable
to tracking by seemingly innocuous applications that do not
request permissions to any sensitive information. We believe
that this calls for rigorous methods and tools to mitigate side-
channel attacks making use of mobile phones sensors.
