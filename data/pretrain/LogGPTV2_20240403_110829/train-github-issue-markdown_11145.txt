When I use `LocalDateTime` in Java and map it to an SQL `TIMESTAMP`, the `ResultSet` fails to correctly invoke the `LocalDateTimeTypeHandler` for conversion. Instead, the framework throws a `java.sql.SQLFeatureNotSupportedException: getObject with type` exception. Could you explain why this is happening?
