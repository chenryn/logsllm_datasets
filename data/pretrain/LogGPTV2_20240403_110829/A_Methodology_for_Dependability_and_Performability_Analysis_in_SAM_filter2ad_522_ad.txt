## Reliability Analysis
Figure 7 shows the numerical results of reliability with respect to the failure rate \( \lambda_f \) of banks based on the rates assignment in Table 3. The reliability requirement is satisfied when \( \lambda_f = 0.001 \).

### Reliability of Specific Request Types
To obtain the reliability of specific types of requests, assign a higher priority to the corresponding immediate transition. For example, to get the reliability of requests from Bank A to Bank C, assign \( t1 \) a higher priority than \( t2 \) through \( t6 \).

## Latency Analysis
Latency measures the expected time for a service request to complete successfully. To analyze latency, revise the SRN model by:
1. Removing all transitions leading to the failure state (PF).
2. Making the success state (PS) an absorbing state, where no outgoing transitions can exit the state.

The expected time for a check to clear is the accumulated time until absorption. This can be calculated using SPNP by assigning a constant reward rate of 1 to each transient state and computing the accumulated reward until absorption.

### Latency Distribution
Figure 8 shows the distribution of overall latency based on the rates assignment in Table 3 and \( \lambda_r = 0.001 \). The results indicate that there is at least a 90% probability that a request is served within 5 time units, satisfying the latency requirement. The expected latency for the payment system is 2.65 time units.

## Conclusion
This methodology for dependability and performability analysis uses the SAM framework. By incorporating stochastic information into a SAM model, an SRN model can be derived and solved using SPNP to evaluate performance, dependability, and performability. This approach allows the SAM framework to analyze both functional and non-functional properties. 

### Future Work
- Validate numerical results through simulation.
- Investigate and extend the SAM framework to include other non-functional properties, such as security.
- Perform trade-off analysis of conflicting non-functional properties.
