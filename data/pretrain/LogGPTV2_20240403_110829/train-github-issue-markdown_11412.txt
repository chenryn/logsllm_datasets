# ðŸš€ Feature request
Hello!  
I am using the translation pipeline, and I noticed that even though I have to
specify the language when I create the pipeline, the passed model overwrites
that. So pipeline created as  
`nlp = pipeline('translation_en_to_de', 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-jap')`  
would translate english to japanese, in contrary to the task name. Is this the
intended way of translating other languages, will it change in the future?
Would it be possible to just add a single 'translation' task for pipelines,
which would then resolve the languages based on the model (which it seems to
do anyway now) ?
## Motivation
It would clear up the current confusion, and make the `pipeline` function
singature less prone to change.  
It could also possibly reduce code duplication in

## My contribution
I'd love to help with a PR, though I'm confused: The `SUPPORTED_TASKS`
dictionary in pipelines.py contains exactly the same entries for each
translation pipeline, even the default model is the same, yet the specific
pipelines actually translate to different languages ðŸ¤”
