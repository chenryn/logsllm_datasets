prover shows the secrecy for the corrected version [39].
Denning-Sacco public-key [23]: Our prover cannot
show the one-session secrecy of the exchanged key, since
there is an attack against this protocol [2]. One-session se-
crecy of the exchanged key is proved for the corrected ver-
sion [2]. Secrecy is not proved since the adversary can force
several sessions of the protocol to use the same key. (We
do not model timestamps in this protocol.) In contrast to
the previous examples, we give the main proof steps to the
prover manually, as follows:
SArename Rkey
crypto enc rkB
crypto sign rkS
crypto sign rkA
success
The variable Rkey deﬁnes a table of public keys, and is
assigned at three places, corresponding to principals A and
B, and to other principals deﬁned by the adversary. The in-
struction SArename Rkey allows us to distinguish these
three cases. The instruction crypto enc rkB means
that the prover should apply the deﬁnition of security of
encryption (primitive enc), for the key generated from ran-
dom number rkB. The instruction success means that
prover should check whether the desired security properties
are proved.
Needham-Schroeder public-key [38]: This protocol is
an authentication protocol. Since our prover cannot check
authentication yet, we transform it into a key exchange pro-
tocol in several ways, by choosing for the key either one
of the nonces NA and NB shared between A and B, or
H(NA, NB) where H is a hash function (in the random or-
acle model). When the key is H(NA, NB), one-session se-
crecy of the key cannot be proved for the original protocol,
due to the well-known attack [33]. For the corrected ver-
sion [33], our prover shows secrecy of the key. For both ver-
sions, the prover cannot prove one-session secrecy of NA or
NB. For NB, the failure of the proof corresponds to an at-
tack: the adversary can check whether it is given NB or a
random number by sending {N (cid:2)
B}pkB to B as the last mes-
sage of the protocol: B accepts if and only if N (cid:2)
B = NB.
For NA, the failure of the proof comes from limitations of
our prover: The prover cannot take into account that NA is
accepted only after all messages that contain NA have been
sent, which prevents the previous attack. (This is the only
case in our examples where the failure of the proof comes
from limitations of the prover. This problem could proba-
bly be solved by improving the transformation Simplify.)
Like for the Denning-Sacco protocol, we provided the main
proof steps to the prover manually, as follows when the dis-
tributed key is NA or NB:
SArename Rkey
crypto sign rkS
crypto enc rkA
crypto enc rkB
success
When the distributed key is H(NA, NB), the proof is as
follows:
SArename Rkey
crypto sign rkS
crypto enc rkA
crypto enc rkB
crypto hash
SArename Na_39
simplify
success
The total runtime for all these tests is 60 s on a Pentium
M 1.8 GHz, for version 1.01 of our prover CryptoVerif.
7 Conclusion
This paper presents a prover for cryptographic protocols
sound in the computational model. This prover works with
no or very little help from the user, can handle a wide va-
riety of cryptographic primitives in a generic way, and pro-
duces proofs valid for a polynomial number of sessions in

the presence of an active adversary. Thus, it represents im-
portant progress with respect to previous work in this area.
We have recently extended our prover to provide exact
security proofs (that is, proofs with an explicit probability
of an attack, instead of the asymptotic result that this proba-
bility is negligible) and to prove correspondence assertions.
We leave these extensions for a future paper. In the future, it
would also be interesting to handle even more cryptographic
primitives, such as Difﬁe-Hellman key agreements. (In or-
der to handle them, the language of equivalences that we
use to specify the security properties of primitives will need
to be extended.)
