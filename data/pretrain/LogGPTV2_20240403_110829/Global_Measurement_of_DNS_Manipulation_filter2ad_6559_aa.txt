Abstract
Despite the pervasive nature of Internet censorship and
the continuous evolution of how and where censorship is
applied, measurements of censorship remain compara-
tively sparse. Understanding the scope, scale, and evo-
lution of Internet censorship requires global measure-
ments, performed at regular intervals. Unfortunately, the
state of the art relies on techniques that, by and large,
require users to directly participate in gathering these
measurements, drastically limiting their coverage and in-
hibiting regular data collection. To facilitate large-scale
measurements that can ﬁll this gap in understanding, we
develop Iris, a scalable, accurate, and ethical method to
measure global manipulation of DNS resolutions.
Iris
reveals widespread DNS manipulation of many domain
names; our ﬁndings both conﬁrm anecdotal or limited re-
sults from previous work and reveal new patterns in DNS
manipulation.
Introduction
1
Anecdotes and reports indicate that Internet censorship
is widespread, affecting at least 60 countries [29, 39].
Despite its pervasive nature, empirical Internet measure-
ments revealing the scope and evolution of Internet cen-
sorship remain relatively sparse. A more complete un-
derstanding of Internet censorship around the world re-
quires diverse measurements from a wide range of geo-
graphic regions and ISPs, not only across countries but
also within regions of a single country. Diversity is im-
portant even within countries, because political dynam-
ics can vary internally, and because different ISPs may
implement ﬁltering policies differently.
Unfortunately, most mechanisms for measuring In-
ternet censorship currently rely on volunteers who run
measurement software deployed on their own Internet-
connected devices (e.g., laptops, phones, tablets) [43,
49]. Because these tools rely on people to install soft-
ware and perform measurements, it is unlikely that they
can ever achieve the scale required to gather continu-
ous and diverse measurements about Internet censorship.
Performing measurements of the scale and frequency
necessary to understand the scope and evolution of In-
ternet censorship calls for fundamentally new techniques
that do not require human involvement or intervention.
We aim to develop techniques that can perform
widespread, longitudinal measurements of global Inter-
net manipulation without requiring the participation of
individual users in the countries of interest. Organiza-
tions may implement censorship at many layers of the In-
ternet protocol stack; they might, for example, block traf-
ﬁc based on IP address, or they might block individual
web requests based on keywords. Recent work has de-
veloped techniques to continuously measure widespread
manipulation at the transport [23,42] and HTTP [45] lay-
ers, yet a signiﬁcant gap remains in our understanding of
global information control concerning the manipulation
of the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS). Towards
this goal, we develop and deploy a method and system
to detect, measure, and characterize the manipulation of
DNS responses in countries across the entire world.
Developing a technique to accurately detect DNS ma-
nipulation poses major challenges. Although previous
work has studied inconsistent or otherwise anomalous
DNS responses [32, 34], these methods have focused
mainly on identifying DNS responses that could reﬂect
a variety of underlying causes, including misconﬁgura-
tions.
In contrast, our work aims to develop methods
for accurately identifying DNS manipulation indicative
of an intent to restrict user access to content. To achieve
high detection accuracy, we rely on a collection of met-
rics that we base on the underlying properties of DNS
domains, resolutions, and infrastructure.
One set of detection metrics focuses on consistency—
intuitively, when we query a domain from different lo-
cations, the IP addresses contained in DNS responses
should reﬂect hosting from either a common server (i.e.,
the same IP address) or the same autonomous system.

Another set of detection metrics focuses on independent
veriﬁability, by comparison to independent information
such as the identity in the TLS certiﬁcate for the web-
site corresponding to the domain. Each of these metrics
naturally lends itself to exceptions: for example, queries
from different locations utilizing a content distribution
network (CDN) will often receive different IP addresses
(and sometimes even different CDNs). However, we can
use violations of all of the metrics as a strong indicator
of DNS manipulation.
In addition to achieving accurate results, another sig-
niﬁcant design challenge concerns ethics. In contrast to
systems that explicitly involve volunteers in collecting
measurements, methods that send DNS queries through
open DNS resolvers deployed across the Internet raise
the issue of potentially implicating third parties who did
not in fact agree to participate in the measurement. Using
“open resolvers” is potentially problematic, as most of
these are not actual resolvers but instead DNS forwarders
in home routers and other devices [46]. A censor may
misattribute requests from these resources as individual
citizens attempting to access censored resources.
Reasoning about the risks of implicating individual
citizens requires detailed knowledge of how censors in
different countries monitor access to censored material
and how they penalize such actions. These policies and
behaviors may be complex, varying across time, region,
individuals involved, and the nature of the censored con-
tent; such risks are likely intractable to accurately de-
duce. To this end, our design takes steps to ensure that,
to the extent possible, we only query open DNS resolvers
hosted in Internet infrastructure (e.g., within Internet ser-
vice providers or cloud hosting providers), in an attempt
to eliminate any use of resolvers or forwarders in the
home networks of individual users. This step reduces
the set of DNS resolvers that we can use for our mea-
surements from tens of millions to only a few thousand.
However, we ﬁnd that the resulting coverage still sufﬁces
to achieve a global view of DNS manipulation, and—
importantly—in a safer way than previous studies that
exploit open DNS resolvers.
Our work makes the following contributions. First,
we design, implement, and deploy Iris, a scalable, eth-
ical system for measuring DNS manipulation. Second,
we develop analysis metrics for disambiguating natural
variation in DNS responses for a domain from nefarious
manipulation. Third, we perform a global measurement
study that highlights the heterogeneity of DNS manip-
ulation, across countries, resolvers, and domains. We
ﬁnd that manipulation varies across DNS resolvers even
within a single country.
2 Related Work
Country-speciﬁc censorship studies.
In recent years
many researchers have investigated the whats, hows, and
whys of censorship in particular countries. These stud-
ies often span a short period of time and reﬂect a single
vantage point within a target country, such as by renting
virtual private servers. For example, studies have specif-
ically focused on censorship practices in China [55],
Iran [7], Pakistan [38], Syria [12], and Egypt [8]. Stud-
ies have also explored the employment of various censor-
ship methods, e.g., injection of fake DNS replies [5, 36],
blocking of TCP/IP connections [54], and application-
level blocking [19, 33, 41]. A number of studies suggest
that countries sometimes change their blocking policies
and methods in times surrounding political events. For
example, Freedom House reports 15 instances of Inter-
net shutdowns—where the government cut off access to
Internet entirely—in 2016 alone [29]. Most of these were
apparently intended to prevent citizens from reaching so-
cial media to spread unwanted information.
Other studies have demonstrated that government cen-
sorship covers a broad variety of services and top-
ics, including video portals (e.g.,youtube.com) [51],
blogs (e.g., livejournal.com) [3], and news sites
(e.g., bbc.com) [9]. Censors also target circumvention
and anonymity tools; most famously, the Great Firewall
of China has engaged in a decade-long cat-and-mouse
game with Tor [24, 53]. Although these studies provide
important data points, each reﬂects a snapshot at a single
point in time and thus cannot capture ongoing trends and
variations in censorship practices.
Global censorship measurement tools. Several re-
search efforts developed platforms to measure censorship
by running experiments from diverse vantage points. For
instance, CensMon [48] used PlanetLab nodes in differ-
ent countries, and UBICA [1] aimed to increase vantage
points by running censorship measurement software on
home gateway devices and user desktops. In practice, as
far as we know, neither of these frameworks are still de-
ployed and collecting data. The OpenNet Initiative [39]
has used its public proﬁle to recruit volunteers around
the world who have performed one-off measurements
from home networks each year for the past ten years.
OONI [49] and ICLab [30], two ongoing data collection
projects, use volunteers to run both custom software and
custom embedded devices (such as Raspberry Pis [26]).
Although each of these frameworks can perform a ex-
tensive set of tests, they rely on volunteers who run mea-
surement software on their Internet-connected devices.
These human involvements make it more challenging—
if not impossible—to gather continuous and diverse mea-
surements.

Pearce et al. recently developed Augur, a method to
perform longitudinal global measurement using TCP/IP
side channels [42]. Although Augur examines a similar
set of domains and countries as Iris, it focuses on identi-
fying IP-based disruption rather than DNS-based manip-
ulation.
Measuring DNS manipulation. The DNS protocol’s
lack of authentication and integrity checking makes it
a prime target for attacks. Jones et al. presented tech-
niques for detecting unauthorized DNS root servers,
though found little such manipulation in practice [32].
Jiang et al. identiﬁed a vulnerability in DNS cache up-
date policies that allows malicious domains to stay in the
cache even if removed from the zone ﬁle [31].
Several projects have explored DNS manipulation us-
ing a limited number of vantage points. Weaver et al. ex-
plored DNS manipulation with respect to DNS redirec-
tion for advertisement purposes [52]. The authors also
observed incidents in which DNS resolvers redirected
end hosts to malware download pages. There are many
country-speciﬁc studies that show how different coun-
tries use a variety of DNS manipulation techniques to ex-
ercise Internet censorship. For example, in Iran the gov-
ernment expects ISPs to conﬁgure their DNS resolvers to
redirect contentious domains to a censorship page [7]. In
Pakistan, ISPs return NXDOMAIN responses [38].
In
China, the Great Firewall injects forged DNS packets
with seemingly arbitrary IP addresses [5]. These studies
however all drew upon a small or geographically limited
set of vantage points, and for short periods of time.
Using open resolvers. A number of studies have ex-
plored DNS manipulation at a larger scale by prob-
ing the IPv4 address space to ﬁnd open resolvers.
In
2008, Dagon et al. found corrupt DNS resolvers by run-
ning measurements using 200,000 open resolvers [18];
they do not analyze the results for potential censor-
ship. A similar scan by anonymous authors [4] in 2012
showed evidence of Chinese DNS censorship affecting
non-Chinese systems.
Follow-on work in 2015 by K¨uhrer et al.
tackled a
much larger scope: billions of lookups for 155 domain
names by millions of open resolvers [34]. The study
examined a broad range of potentially tampered results,
which in addition to censorship included malware, phish-
ing, domain parking, ad injection, captive portals, search
redirection, and email delivery. They detected DNS ma-
nipulation by comparing DNS responses from open re-
solvers with ground truth resolutions gathered by query-
ing control resolvers. They then identiﬁed legitimate un-
manipulated answers using a number of heuristic ﬁlter-
ing stages, such as treating a differing response as legit-
imate if its returned IP address lies within the same AS
the ground truth IP address.
We tried to use their method for conducting global
measurements speciﬁcally for detecting censorship.
However, censorship detection was not a focus of their
work, and the paper does not explicitly describe the de-
tails of its detection process.
In particular, other than
examining HTTP pages for “blocked by the order of
. . . ” phrasing, the paper does not present a decision pro-
cess for determining whether a given instance of appar-
ent manipulation reﬂects censorship or some other phe-
nomenon. In addition, their measurements leverage open
resolvers en masse, which raises ethical concerns for end
users who may be wrongly implicated for attempting to
access banned content. In contrast, we frame an explicit,
reproducible method for globally measuring DNS-based
manipulation in an ethically responsible manner.
In 2016, Scott et al. introduced Satellite [47], a sys-
tem which leverages open resolvers to identify CDN
deployments and network interference using collected
resolutions. Given a bipartite graph linking domains
queried with IP address answers collected from the open
resolvers, Satellite identiﬁes strongly connected com-
ponents, which represent domains hosted by the same
servers. Using metrics for domain similarity based on
the overlap in IP addresses observed for two domains,
Satellite distinguishes CDNs from network interference
as components with highly similar domains (addition-
ally, other heuristics help reﬁne this classiﬁcation).
3 Method
In this section we describe Iris, a scalable, lightweight
system to detect DNS manipulation. We begin by scop-
ing the problem space, identifying the capabilities and
limitations of various measurement building blocks, and
stating our assumptions about the threat model. We ex-
plain the process by which we select (1) which domain
names to measure, and (2) the vantage points to measure
them from, taking into consideration questions of ethics
and scalability. We then describe, given a set of mea-
surement vantage points and DNS domain names, how
we characterize the results of our measurements and use
them to draw conclusions about whether DNS manipu-
lation is taking place, based on either the consistency or
the independent veriﬁability of the responses that we re-
ceive. Next, we consider our technical approach in light
of existing ethical norms and guidelines, and explain how
various design decisions help us adhere to those princi-
ples as much as possible. Finally, we discuss the implicit
and technical limitations of Iris.
3.1 Overview
We aim to identify DNS manipulation, which we deﬁne
as the instance of a DNS response both (1) having at-
tributes (e.g., IP addresses, autonomous systems, web
USENIX Association
26th USENIX Security Symposium    309
content) that are not consistent with respect to a well-
deﬁned control set; and (2) returning information that is
demonstrably incorrect when compared against indepen-
dent information sources (e.g., TLS certiﬁcates).
Approach. Detecting DNS manipulation is conceptu-
ally simple: At a high-level, the idea entails performing
DNS queries through geographically distributed DNS re-
solvers and analyzing the responses for activity that sug-
gests that the responses for a DNS domain might be ma-
nipulated. Despite its apparent simplicity, however, real-
izing a system to scalably collect DNS data and analyze
it for manipulation poses both ethical and technical chal-
lenges. The ethical challenges concern selecting DNS
resolvers that do not implicate innocent citizens, as well
as ensuring that Iris does not induce undue load on the
DNS resolution infrastructure; §3.2 explains the ethical
guidelines we use to reason about design choices. §3.3
describes how Iris selects a “safe” set of open DNS re-
solvers; The technical challenges center around develop-
ing sound methods for detecting manipulation, which we
describe in §3.4 and §3.5.
Identifying DNS names to query. Iris queries a list of
sensitive URLs compiled by Citizen Lab [14]. We call
this list the Citizen Lab Block List (CLBL). This list of
URLs is compiled by experts based on known censor-
ship around the world, divided by category. We distill
the URLs down to domain names and use this list as
the basis of our dataset. We then supplement this list
by adding additional domain names selected at random
from the Alexa Top 10,000 [2]. These additional domain
names help address geographic or content biases in the
the CLBL while not drastically increasing the total num-
ber of queries.
Assumptions and focus. First, Iris aims to identify
widespread manipulation at the scale of Internet service
providers and countries. We cannot identify manipu-
lation that is targeted at speciﬁc individuals or popula-
tions or manipulation activities that exploit high-value
resources such as valid but stolen certiﬁcates. Second,
we focus on manipulation tactics that do not rely on
stealth; we assume that adversaries will use DNS re-
solvers to manipulate the responses to DNS queries. We
assume that adversaries do not return IP addresses that
are incorrect but within the same IP preﬁx as a correct
answer [5, 7, 38]. Finally, when attributing DNS ma-
nipulation to a particular country or dependent territory,
we rely on the country information available from Cen-
sys [21] supplemented with MaxMind’s [37] dataset to
map a resolver to a speciﬁc country (or dependent terri-
tory).
3.2 Ethics
The design of Iris incorporates many considerations re-
garding ethics. Our primary ethical concern is the risks
associated with the measurements that Iris conducts, as
issuing DNS queries for potentially censored or manipu-
lated DNS domains through resolvers that we do not own
could potentially implicate otherwise innocent users. A
second concern is whether the DNS queries that we gen-
erate introduce undue query load on authoritative DNS
nameservers for domains that we do not own. With these
concerns in mind, we consider the ethics of performing
measurements with Iris, using the ethical guidelines of
the Belmont Report [10] and Menlo Report [20] to frame
