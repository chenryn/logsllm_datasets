ABSTRACT 
The objective of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing 
and Collaborative Security is to advance the scientific foundations 
for  sharing  security-related  data.  Improving  information  sharing 
remains an important theme in the computer security community.  
A number of new sharing communities have been formed. Also, 
so called “threat intelligence” originating from open, commercial 
or  governmental  sources  has  by  now  become  an  important, 
commonly  used  tool  for  detecting  and  mitigating  attacks  in 
organizations.  Security  vendors  are  offering  novel  technologies 
for  sharing,  managing  and  consuming  such  data.  The  OASIS 
Technical  Committee  for  Cyber  Threat  Intelligence  (CTI)  is 
creating a standard for structured sharing of information. This is 
the largest TC within OASIS attesting to the broad interest in the 
topic.   
As progress in real-life deployment of information sharing makes 
clear, the creation, analysis, sharing, and effective use of security 
data continues to raise intriguing technical problems.  Addressing 
these problems will be critical for the ultimate success of sharing 
efforts  and  will  benefit  greatly  from  the  diverse  knowledge  and 
techniques the scientific community brings.       
The  3rd  ACM  Workshop  on 
Information  Sharing  and 
Collaborative  Security  (WISCS’16)  brings  together  experts  and 
practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present 
innovative  research,  case  studies,  and  legal  and  policy  issues. 
WISCS’16  is  held  in  Vienna,  Austria  on  October  24,  2016  in 
conjunction  with  the  23rd  ACM  Conference  on  Computer  and 
Communications Security (ACM CCS 2016).

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Security  technologists  have  asked  for  a  number  of  years  to 
increase  sharing  of  security  and  threat  related  data,  yet  the 
perceived risks and implications to reputation have been a major 
hurdle for organizations.  The last few years saw major progress 
in  overcoming  these  obstacles.  As  a  recent  example  from 
December  2015,  the  Cybersecurity  Act  in  the  US  and  the  NIS 
(Network  and  Information  Security)  Directive  in  the  EU  now 
provide  better  legal  foundations  for  information  sharing.  Highly 
publicized, sophisticated attacks have also driven the point home 
to many organizations that they need to share more effectively in 
order to stand a chance against their adversaries. A number of new 
sharing groups, e.g., by retailers or the healthcare industry, have 
been formed as a result. Existing sharing communities such as the 
Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-
ISAC)  and  the  IT  ISAC  have  started  to  routinely  use  new 
technologies  for  automated  sharing  of  security  indicators  and 
other information with and between their members. Some of the 
technologies  this  workshop  aims  to  advance  have  applications 
beyond  traditional  cyber-security,  e.g.,  for  sharing  information 
about  cyber-physical  systems  and  incidents  (such  as  SCADA 
systems) or secure sharing of information on suspects (as the EU 
is trying to establish after the recent terror attacks). 
The  practical  benefits  of  information  sharing  are  by  now 
undisputed. Yet, the scientific basis of information sharing is less 
clear.  The fundamental problems of information sharing arise in a 
number  of  different  scientific  contexts  and 
require  an 
interdisciplinary  approach.  Some  scientific  fields  that  contribute 
to a science of information sharing are:  
economics of security (why share information?) 
intrusion detection (what information to share and 
what to do with it?) 
privacy (how can we protect intangible assets such 
as privacy or reputation?) 
The  increased  adoption  of  information  sharing  also  shows 
that  important  challenges  remain.  For  example,  just  sharing  low 
level  indicators  without  any  clear  contextual  information  is 
increasingly viewed as offering little value. We need better ways 
to add context to indicators.  Quality control and false positives 
rates  are  another  common  concern  for  practitioners.    Another 
observation is that in many sharing communities sharing behavior 
is heavily skewed: a small number of participants contributes the 
vast  majority  of 
their 
effectiveness.  
We  are  hopeful  that  the  science  of  information  sharing  as 
advanced in the WISCS workshop series will address these (and 
other) challenges, so that sharing broadly improves  the level of 
protection from cyber intrusions.

3.  PROGRAM FORMAT  
WISCS’16  is  a  one-day  workshop  held  in  Vienna,  Austria  on 
October 24, 2015. It is pre-conference workshop to the 23rd ACM 
Conference  on  Computer  and  Communications  Security  (ACM 
CCS  2016).  The  workshop  opens  with  a  one  hour  keynote.  The 
keynote is followed by paper presentations.   
All  submissions  were  peer-reviewed  by  at  least  3  PC  members. 
The  workshop  received  26  submissions  of  which  we  expect  to 
accept around 9 papers as full papers. The number of submissions 
increased by more than 50% from WISCS’15.    
4.  CONCLUSION 
WISCS  is  the  first  workshop  devoted  solely  to  the  scientific 
aspects  of  sharing  threat  and  security  related  data.  The  practical 
benefits of information sharing are undisputed, and a wide variety 
of national and international industry initiatives are on-going. Yet, 
the scientific basis of information sharing is less clear.  We expect 
a number of new insights and impulses towards a scientific basis 
and new technologies for information sharing to emerge from the 
WISCS workshop series.
