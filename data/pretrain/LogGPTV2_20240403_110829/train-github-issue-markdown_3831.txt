I've reproduced this on the DEB package (might likely applies to the RPM
package also).
I ran across a scenario wherein user was using the DEB package. Then they
opened the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file and changed
`path.plugins` to point to a different folder (anything really)
After this, they installed Marvel (or any plugin for that matter).
Unfortunately, the plugin was installed into
`/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins` instead of picking up the `path.plugins`
override in the elasticsearch.yml file. Thus when starting ES, the plugin does
not load correctly.
This can be potentially fixed by changing the plugin script line to:
    exec $JAVA $JAVA_OPTS -Xmx64m -Xms16m -Delasticsearch -Des.path.home="$ES_HOME" -Des.config="/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml" $properties -cp "$ES_HOME/lib/*" org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginManager $args
I'm not 100% sure if this has other implications or is the right approach
here.
