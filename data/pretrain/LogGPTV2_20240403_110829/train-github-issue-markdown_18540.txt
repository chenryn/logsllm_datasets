I have simple dropdown buttons we built with 2.04
links are A tags, proper quotes, href='#'
Used to work fine.
Upgraded today to 2.1 and the links in any dropdown button don't work. The
dropdown menu opens, but clicking on a link closes the menu without any
action. tested on Android 2.3 and iOS 5
Rolledback to 2.04 and everything works again. Anyone else has this issue?
