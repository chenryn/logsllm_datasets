**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a system designed to differentiate between legitimate and malicious database transactions initiated by application programs. The system is particularly effective in defending against code-modification attacks carried out by insiders who have the authority to alter the source code of these programs, enabling them to execute unauthorized queries. Our solution is compatible with any type of DBMS and requires minimal changes to the application programs.

**1. Introduction**
Organizations across various sectors, including government agencies, commercial enterprises, and research institutions, are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated insider threats. These threats can be perpetrated by disgruntled employees or those engaged in espionage, with a primary objective being the exfiltration of sensitive data. Traditional security measures often fall short in mitigating such risks.

One key strategy for protecting against data exfiltration is the use of anomaly detection tools, which create profiles of normal transaction patterns and monitor database accesses for deviations [1]. For example, if a clerk typically accesses only 10% of the records in a table, an attempt to retrieve all records would be flagged as suspicious. However, existing anomaly detection methods often assume that queries are issued directly by users, overlooking the fact that many queries are generated by application programs.

A malicious insider, such as a software engineer with the ability to modify application source code, can exploit this oversight to exfiltrate data. To address this, one approach is to profile the queries issued by application programs and compare actual accesses against these profiles. This is challenging due to the variability in queries based on input parameters and context, making it impractical to record and store all possible legitimate query sequences.

**2. Preliminaries**
- **Symbolic Execution**: A program analysis technique that uses symbolic values as inputs and expressions to represent variable values. It generates a symbolic execution tree, where each node represents a path through the program, along with the corresponding path constraints [3].
- **Software Instrumentation**: The process of adding code to a program to monitor its behavior, which can be done statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at runtime).
- **Backward Data Slice**: The sub-program that affects the value of a specific variable at a given point in the program.

**3. Proposed System**

**3.1 Architecture**
Our system comprises four main components:
- **Target DBMS (T-DBMS)**: The database management system under protection.
- **Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE)**: Analyzes and compares expected and actual query sequences.
- **Query Interceptor**: Captures and forwards queries from the application to the ADE.
- **Response Router**: Routes responses from the T-DBMS back to the application.

These components work together to ensure that the sequence of queries sent by an application program is consistent with the expected behavior.

**3.2 Profile Creation Phase**
During the profile creation phase, our system employs software testing techniques to build a detailed profile of the application program. This profile includes the control structure and the locations in the code where SQL queries are generated. The symbolic execution tree is used to capture all possible paths and the corresponding path constraints.

**3.3 Detection Phase**
In the detection phase, the system uses the created profile and the input values to predict the expected queries. These predictions are then compared with the actual queries sent to the T-DBMS. Any discrepancies are flagged as potential anomalies, indicating a possible insider attack.

**4. Conclusion**
This paper presents a novel approach to detecting and preventing data exfiltration insider attacks through application programs. By leveraging symbolic execution and software instrumentation, our system can effectively identify and mitigate the risk of unauthorized data access. Future work will focus on enhancing the scalability and accuracy of the system in real-world scenarios.
