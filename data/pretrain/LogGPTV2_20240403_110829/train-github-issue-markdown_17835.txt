If you look at the `iter` branch in the `nikomatsakis/rust` repo, you will
find that it fails in stage0. I debugged this a bit by building a vanilla
compiler in another repoistory and managed to trace it as far as a failure in
`make_mono_id()` because the call to `map2()` that is processing bounds and
substs receives a bounds vec of length 1 and a substs vec of length 2. This
seems to occur with the call to `vec::flatmap()` that occurs in librustsyntax
processing the attributes. I tried to narrow down the test to a smaller test
file but was unable to find anything that reproduced the error other than the
full rustc.
@marijnh if you wouldn't mind taking a look and let me know if something jumps
out at you, I would appreciate it.
