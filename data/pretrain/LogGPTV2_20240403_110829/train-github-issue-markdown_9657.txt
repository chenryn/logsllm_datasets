### To Reproduce
See electron fiddle at:
https://gist.github.com/Niquolas/81cc70179578975651e7efd94d6f9748
Ensure any adblockers e.g. Pi-hole are disabled.
  1. Launch the application
  2. Wait for the page to fully load
  3. Interact with the page (clicking on an ad yields the most consistent results)
### Additional Information
There seems to be a script on the page (probably an advert, as enabling Pi-
hole negates the issue for me) that is causing the native crash.
Not sure if this is an Electron bug or something further upstream, so I
thought it best to check here. Apologies if this is out of scope.
