are  especially  important  in  this  process  phase  as  they  are  the  individuals 
interacting with employees most frequently. The activities within Leadership 
Support during this process phase serve to identify, assess, and coach mid-level 
managers and supervisors. 
Figure  2-6  shows  the  inputs,  roles,  skills,  activities,  tools,  and  outputs  of 
Leadership Support within the Executing Process Phase.

2.3.1 Inputs 
In order to complete the Executing Process Phase Leadership Support activities 
within Executing, the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of 
the following inputs: 
Stakeholder  Register:  The  Stakeholder  Register,  developed  in  the  Initiating 
Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, identifies the organizations, groups, 
and individuals with a role in the project. 
Stakeholder  Management  Plan:  The  Stakeholder  Management  Plan, 
developed  in  the  Planning  Process  Phase  as  prescribed  by  the  CA-PMF, 
describes the processes, procedures, tools, and techniques to efectively engage 
Stakeholders in project decisions based on Stakeholder needs, interests, and 
requirements.

As the project continues through the PMLC, it becomes necessary/important for 
the project to involve leadership at throughout all levels of the organization. In 
addition to continuing previous process phase activities to support the Project 
Sponsor and executive leaders as needed, the OCM Practitioner should focus 
on  supporting  mid-level  management  and  supervisors  during  the  Executing 
Process Phase. 
Support Managers and Supervisors 
In the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner worked to build leadership 
support  for  the  change  initiative  by  meeting  with  all  executive  leaders 
to  understand  their  engagement  in  and  support  of  the  project.  The  OCM 
Practitioner should continue these eforts in the Executing Process Phase with 
a focus on mid-level managers and supervisors, identified in the Stakeholder 
Register and Stakeholder Management Plan. These leaders ofen serve as the 
bridge between employees and executive leadership. Managers and supervisors 
can communicate directly with employees, gauge their support, and identify 
and  mitigate  resistance.  As  such,  it  is  important  for  the  OCM  Practitioner  to 
meet with managers and supervisors, individually or in small focus groups, to: 
•   Foster in-depth connections between the OCM Practitioner and the 
managers and supervisors. 
•   Encourage thought among managers and supervisors about what is 
required for a successful change initiative, and what their role should be. 
•   Build the OCM Practitioner’s understanding of the organizational change at 
the manager/supervisor level to help the project team navigate the political 
issues and struggles that are inevitable parts of change. 
The  OCM  Practitioner  can  utilize  the  Executive  Interview  Guide,  also  used  in 
the Planning Process Phase, when meeting with executive leaders. The OCM 
Practitioner can repurpose this tool to guide discussions with managers and 
supervisors.  The  Executive  Interview  Guide  addresses  general  background 
information  about  the  manager/supervisor,  prior  experience  with  change, 
the  organization’s  vision  and  strategy,  and  political  environment  and  team 
dynamics.  It  is  meant  to  be  an  informal  working  document,  which  the  OCM 
Practitioner should keep confidential due to the sensitive nature of some of the 
information collected.

Executing | Page 26 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingLeadership SupportOnce the OCM Practitioner has conducted these interviews or focus groups, the 
data should be compiled to identify the main strengths (as a foundation for a 
successful change initiative), main questions (or things to be looked into), and 
possible concerns (or things that could impede success). The OCM Practitioner 
should assess these aspects on an individual level as well as for the manager/ 
supervisor group as a whole. In this manner, the OCM Practitioner may build on 
identified strengths, research questions, and identify actions to address possible 
problems. One such mitigating action includes requesting the assistance of the 
Project  Sponsor  or  other  executive  leaders  to  address  concerns  by  meeting 
personally with managers and supervisors or having a broader discussion with 
the manager/supervisor group. 
The OCM Practitioner should utilize the Leadership Support Action Log to record 
all Leadership Support actions. This working document, initially developed in 
the Initiating Process Phase, serves to track all Leadership Support activities 
and tasks.

Figure 2-7 
In the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner focuses on monitoring 
team dynamics while the project team expands to include additional resources, 
as shown in Figure 2-7. It is important to introduce, review, and discuss team 
behavior guidelines as new team members are added to maintain a cohesive 
team and positive working environment. Team Dynamics activities, including 
surveys  and  sessions,  build  on  the  initial  team  behavior  guidelines  session 
conducted in the Planning Process Phase to keep the behavior guidelines at the 
forefront of the team’s consciousness. This cycle of assessment and discussion 
creates and maintains a constructive environment.

2.4.1 Inputs 
In order to complete the Executing Process Phase Team Dynamics activities, the  
OCM Practitioner will need a thorough knowledge of the following inputs: 
Team Guidelines: The Team Guidelines, developed in the Initiating Process Phase  
by the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager, define the behaviors expected of  
all  project  team  members.  These  guidelines  form  the  foundation  for  all  team  
interactions, both within the team and with outside resources. 
Team  Dynamics  Action  Log:  The  Team  Dynamics  Action  Log,  created  in  the  
Planning Process Phase by the OCM Practitioner, provides an account of all Team  
Dynamics activities, responsible resources, and timelines that have occurred in  
Initiating and Planning. This informal working document keeps an ongoing record  
of all knowledge area activities and should be updated throughout the Executing  
Process Phase as needed.

Conduct  Team  Guidelines  and  Team  Efectiveness 
Surveys and Follow-up Sessions 
In the Planning Process Phase, the Project Manager introduced and reinforced 
the  need  for  team  guidelines.  During  the  Executing  Process  Phase,  the  OCM 
Practitioner  will  continue  to  work  with  the  Project  Manager  to  assess  the 
project team’s adoption of all guidelines. The OCM Practitioner may utilize the 
Team Guidelines Survey, which asks team members’ opinions on how the entire 
team is performing the guidelines. The survey consists of a statement for each 
team guideline that project team members can rank on a scale from 1 (strongly 
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). 
The  OCM  Practitioner  should  have  all  team  members  complete  the  survey 
in order to gather as much data as possible. An additional resource the OCM 
Practitioner  may  leverage  is  the  Team  Efectiveness  Survey.  This  tool  allows 
project  team  members  to  rate  the  efectiveness  of  the  project  team  in  eight 
categories: goals, participation, feelings, problem solving, leadership, decision 
making,  trust,  and  creativity  and  growth.  Both  the  Team  Guidelines  Survey 
and the Team Efectiveness Survey will provide input into addressing any team 
dynamics concerns. While the Team Guidelines Survey and Team Efectiveness 
Survey were developed as two separate templates, the OCM Practitioner may 
find it beneficial, in practice, to combine the surveys in order to gain a complete 
picture without overloading the project team with surveys. 
Once the OCM Practitioner compiles the data from the surveys, he/she should 
assess  the  results,  looking  for  team  guidelines  or  categories  that  scored 
the  lowest  and  thus  need  the  highest  amount  of  efort  to  correct.  The  OCM 
Practitioner  should  share  the  overall  results  with  the  Project  Manager  and 
project team in order to facilitate a follow-up session to discuss team guidelines 
and next steps. The OCM Practitioner, Project Manager, and project team should 
consider the following questions during the follow up sessions: 
•  How do the team guidelines impact the team’s efectiveness? 
•  If a team guideline is performed well, what does it look like? 
•  Which guidelines need improvement? 
•  What are the consequences for not performing a team guideline well? 
•  What steps can the team take to improve a specific team guideline?

•  How will team members communicate to each other if a guideline is not 
being practiced? 
•  Why should team members make an efort to change their behavior? 
•  How will the team know when they are successfully practicing a guideline? 
The  OCM  Practitioner  and  Project  Manager  may  utilize  the  Team  Guidelines  
Survey, Team Efectiveness Survey, and subsequent follow up sessions multiple  
times  throughout  the  Executing  Process  Phase  as  checkpoints  and  course  
corrections. These assessments provide a useful tool for new and existing team  
members to review the team guidelines and to identify any areas that may need  
improvement. 
Throughout the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner should utilize 
the Team Dynamics Action Log, initially developed during the Planning Process 
Phase, to record and track all Team Dynamics activities. The log, initially created 
in the Initiating Process Phase, provides a record of all Team Dynamics activities 
for  the  Project  Manager  to  review.  It  also  allows  for  a  smooth  transition  of 
responsibilities if there is a change in resource filling the OCM Practitioner or 
Project Manager role. 
2.4.4 Tools
