Before the recent update, I had successfully completed all waypoints, bonfires, and ziplines up to the TicTacToe section. However, after completing the challenges in section 4, "Gear Up For Success," I noticed that a significant number of previously completed waypoints and bonfires were marked as "incomplete." 

To illustrate this issue, I have attached a screenshot below:

Additionally, the solutions for these challenges no longer appear on my profile. Despite this, I still retain the points from those challenges (I currently have 305 points after re-completing one of the affected challenges in an attempt to reproduce the bug).

I have not been able to consistently reproduce the bug, but I suspect it may be related to the new challenges overwriting the completion status of the previously completed ones.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
