Prior to the update I had completed all waypoints, bonfires and ziplines up
until TicTacToe.  
After completing challenges in section 4. "Gear Up For Success" I noticed that
a large amount of waypoints and bonfires had become "incomplete"(I've attached
a screenshot below to show what I mean. ) and the solutions did not show up on
my profile however I still had the points from those challenges (I'm currently
at 305 after re-doing a challenge that became incomplete to try and re-create
the bug).
I haven't been able to recreate the bug however I believe it's related to the
new challenges being completed and overwriting previously completed challenges
somehow.
