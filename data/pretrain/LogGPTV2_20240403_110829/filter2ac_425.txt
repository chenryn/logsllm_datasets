Adversaries may leverage existing, legitimate external web services as a means to relay data to and from a compromised system. Popular websites and social media platforms, when used as command and control (C2) mechanisms, can provide significant cover for malicious activities. This is because hosts within a network are likely already communicating with these services prior to a compromise. By using common services such as those offered by Google or Twitter, adversaries can blend their traffic with the expected noise, making it more difficult to detect. Additionally, many web service providers use SSL/TLS encryption, which adds an extra layer of protection for the adversaries, further complicating detection efforts.
