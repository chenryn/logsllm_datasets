To install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI) on Ubuntu 14.04, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Extract the EB CLI:**
   - You have already downloaded the `.zip` file and extracted it to a folder, for example, `/home/roberto/app/AWS-ElasticBeanstalk-CLI-2.6.1`.

2. **Navigate to the Extracted Folder:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `eb` command is located:
     ```sh
     cd /home/roberto/app/AWS-ElasticBeanstalk-CLI-2.6.1/eb/linux/python2.7
     ```

3. **Install the EB CLI:**
   - Run the installation script:
     ```sh
     sudo ./install
     ```

4. **Add the EB CLI to Your PATH:**
   - The `eb` command needs to be in your system's `PATH` environment variable. Add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`):
     ```sh
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
     ```
   - Reload the shell configuration:
     ```sh
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

5. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Check if the `eb` command is now available:
     ```sh
     eb --version
     ```

If you encounter the "eb: command not found" error, ensure that the `eb` executable is correctly installed and that the `PATH` environment variable includes the correct directory.

### Additional Notes:
- If you are using Python 3, the path might be different. For Python 3, you can try:
  ```sh
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.x/site-packages/
  ```
  Replace `x` with the minor version number of your Python 3 installation.

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to install the EB CLI. Using `sudo` may be required for some steps.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install and use the AWS EB CLI on your Ubuntu 14.04 system.
