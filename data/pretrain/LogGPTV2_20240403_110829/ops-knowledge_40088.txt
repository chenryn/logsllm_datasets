User: Im trying to install AWS eb command line interface in Ubuntu 14.04. I just donwloaded the .zip file. Extracted in a folder. if I go to folder where eb is (/home/roberto/app/AWS-ElasticBeanstalk-CLI-2.6.1/eb/linux/python2.7) and run it, I get: eb: command not found
Same if I do it with python3 path.
Assistant: In ubuntu we write like :
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
It worked for me after writing this because eb folder will be present inside mentioned folder.
