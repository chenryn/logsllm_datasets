The profits generated from cryptojacking are transferred to the same wallet. These findings did not lead to the discovery of new campaigns but confirmed previous observations. For example, the proxy `wss://delagrossemerde.com:8181/` (used by 15 sites) exclusively receives traffic from domains using the same wallet.

The various methods employed in this section enabled us to identify 204 cryptojacking campaigns. We can conclude that the largest campaigns utilize third-party services such as WordPress, Drupal, or Magento for their propagation. Only one campaign was identified that used advertisements with injected cryptojacking scripts, which contrasts with previous studies by [22, 39], who reported malicious advertisements as a significant attack vector. Compromised websites or campaigns initiated by website owners are generally smaller in scale. The obfuscation level in most campaigns is relatively low, with heavily obfuscated code being rare. In more than half of the identified campaigns, the miner was added in plain text.

### 6.2 In-Depth Campaign Search

The sizes of the campaigns identified in Section 6.1 depend on the dataset we crawled, so they could have been incomplete. To find more websites belonging to the identified campaigns, we used the indicators of compromise for a large number of campaigns and queried PublicWWW for matching domains. This resulted in a dataset of 7,892 websites. Combined with the 21,022 potentially cryptojacking websites from the initial crawl, a total of 25,121 URLs were crawled on February 12, 2019, more than a month after the initial crawl. We successfully obtained 24,187 (96%) of them.

Most of the campaigns remained of similar size in this crawl, except for a campaign involving three keys: `ef937f99557277ff62a6fc0e5b3da90ea9550ebcdfac`, `06d93b846706f4dca9996baa15d4d207e82d1e86676c`, and `dd27d0676efdecb12703623d6864bbe9f4e7b3f69f2e`. This advanced campaign targets domains using Bitrix24, a CRM platform used by various organizations. The most notable website it was found on is the Ministry of Education of Belarus (https://edu.gov.by/). The malicious code is hidden as the core loader of Bitrix24 and uses both Nerohut and Cryptoloot for mining. It includes an anti-detection method, stopping mining once a developer tools window is opened. In our initial crawl, we identified only 68 domains belonging to this campaign, which increased to 855 in our in-depth search, making it the second-largest campaign identified so far. Another campaign, involving key `vPfPDHk89TxmH1arysiJDrutpYGntofP`, displays fake loading screens on 86 websites, whereas only 47 of these were identified in our initial crawl.

All other campaigns remained similar or slightly smaller in size. Except for the two aforementioned campaigns, we conclude that our initial crawl likely identified the correct size of the campaigns, given the database of PublicWWW. Their database contains source code snapshots of over 544 million websites, providing a robust approximation.

### 6.3 Evolution of Cryptojacking

To study the evolution of cryptojacking on the Internet, data from different time points is needed. Fortunately, Konoth et al. [22] shared their crawling results, and Hong et al. [19] shared their list of identified cryptojacking domains, allowing us to crawl the same sets of URLs and analyze whether these domains were still mining. Additionally, we followed the domains identified in our crawls over a period of three months and analyzed WebSocket proxy traffic over time using operator NetFlows.

#### Comparison with Previous Crawls

Konoth et al. [22] crawled from March 12 to 19, 2018, and identified 1,735 potential cryptojacking domains. We crawled their list on January 21, 2019, and obtained 1,725 of them. 85% of the websites are no longer cryptomining, and only 10% are still using the same application. On 136 websites (7%), the same key was found in both crawls. As Figure 5 shows, a large number of websites using a Coinhive miner removed the miner application. Some continued using Coinhive, but a small shift towards less popular mining applications can be observed. Websites already using these miners tend to stick to their choice and are still using the same miner almost a year later. We also observed several mining applications becoming extinct, such as Deepminer and NF Webminer.

Hong et al. [19] published the list of identified cryptojacking domains from their crawl in February 2018. A year later, on February 12, 2019, we crawled this list of 2,770 domains. We obtained 2,435 (88%) of them, and only 340 (14%) domains are still actively cryptojacking. Both crawls show that a large number of websites stopped cryptojacking themselves or removed the miner infection. After one year, approximately 85% of the domains are no longer actively cryptojacking. We also observed a small portion of domains switching to less popular applications. The low number of 7% of websites that are still mining with the same siteKey indicates the rapid changes in the cryptojacking threat landscape.

#### Evolution of Identified Domains

We followed all previously identified cryptojacking domains for a period of three months (until May 5, 2019) and crawled them initially occasionally, but then every other day. Within this time period, Coinhive announced the end of its mining application due to decreased Monero prices and hash rate [7]. The announcement was made on February 26, 2019, stating that mining would cease after March 8, 2019, and the service would be discontinued by the end of April 2019. This led to a drastic change in the cryptojacking landscape, as Coinhive's dominance in active mining installations collapsed when their mining service became non-operational. Mining applications were not massively replaced, confirming our finding that a large portion of browser-based cryptomining is not initiated by the website owner. Only when the Coinhive mining service was actually discontinued and errors were shown while requesting the offline Coinhive mining resources, we observed a small increase in Cryptoloot and CoinImp installations.

#### WebSocket Proxy Traffic Over Time

As discussed in Section 2, most miner applications use a WebSocket proxy server to forward traffic from their miners to the mining pool. Using the NetFlow data mentioned earlier, we analyzed traffic towards popular WebSocket proxies from September 2017 to December 2018, providing insight into the evolution of cryptomining applications usage, as shown in Figure 7. We used the set of WebSocket proxy IPs the miners connect to as a basis, extending it with passive DNS data to discover other WebSocket proxy server IPs used by these applications but hosted on different servers not encountered during our crawls. The same passive DNS data was used to verify that these IP addresses were solely used as WebSocket proxy servers. To prevent other traffic to these servers from being included in our dataset, we set the maximum packet size to 550 kB and verified that only WebSocket traffic was counted towards these servers. For most proxies, this is traffic towards port 80 or 443, and for a few servers using specific ports, this could differ. An example is the WebSocket proxy server of the WP-monero-miner, which uses port 8020.

The blue line from September 2017 shows how the web-mining ecosystem was initially monopolized by innovator Coinhive, with copycats like Cryptoloot and Webmine emerging in October. We see that CoinImp essentially started to eclipse all other miner applications from mid-April 2018 onwards in terms of mining traffic to the proxies, which is unexpected given the distribution of installations on websites and previous studies. Some mining proxies only had transient success: a notable example is the WP-monero-miner, released shortly after Coinhive in 2017. The application

| Type | Percentage | # of Websites |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Coinhive | 48.767% | 2,531 |

| Browsermine | 1.407% | 73 |
| Webminepool | 1.195% | 62 |
| WP-Monero-Miner | 1.156% | 60 |
| Omine | 1.079% | 56 |
| Monero-mining | 1.060% | 55 |
| Cryptonoter | 0.963% | 50 |
| Cryptominer | 0.501% | 26 |
| Minero | 0.462% | 24 |
| Nebula | 0.443% | 23 |
| Webmine | 0.366% | 19 |
| Coincube | 0.366% | 19 |

| Adless | 0.019% | 1 |

This means that one in every 9,090 websites is cryptojacking. Comparing this number to the statistics of the top lists used in our initial crawl, we conclude that cryptojacking activity is mainly focused on the popular parts of the Internet. In the Alexa Top 1M, 0.065% of the websites were actively cryptojacking, while in this random sample, only 0.011% of the websites, which is almost six times lower. This can be explained by the profitability of cryptojacking, where higher popularity means more visitors, yielding more potential miners and thus higher potential profits. Additionally, it shows that researching the prevalence of cryptojacking by crawling the Alexa Top 1M overestimates the problem size. However, the distribution of used applications in our random sample is fairly similar to the distribution in the Alexa Top 1M. The distribution of mining applications in this crawl is listed in Table 7.

The categories of domains identified in this crawl are very similar to the initial crawl. As depicted in Figure 8, adult content remains the most prevalent category, followed by technology and under-construction sites.
