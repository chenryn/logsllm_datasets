its made by cryptojacking are transferred to the exact same
wallet. These ﬁndings did not lead to the discovery of any
new campaigns, but did conﬁrm previous ﬁndings. E.g., proxy
wss://delagrossemerde.com:8181/ (used by 15 sites) is
solely receiving trafﬁc from domains using the same wallet.
The different methods used in this section enabled us to
ﬁnd 204 cryptojacking campaigns. We can conclude that the
largest campaigns are using third-party services like Word-
Press, Drupal or Magento as their method of spreading. Only
one campaign using advertisements with injected cryptojack-
ing scripts has been identiﬁed, this in contrast to previous
work by [22, 39], who reported malicious advertisements as a
signiﬁcant attack vector. Compromised websites or website
owner initiated campaigns are generally smaller in size. The
obfuscation level used in most campaigns is rather low, hea-
vily obfuscated code is encountered rarely and in more than
half of the identiﬁed campaigns a miner added in plain text.

6.2 A in-depth campaign search
The sizes of the campaigns identiﬁed in Section 6.1 depend
on the dataset we crawled, so they could have been incom-
plete. To ﬁnd more websites belonging to the identiﬁed cam-
paigns, we have taken the indicators of compromise for a large
number of campaigns and queried PublicWWW for domains
matching these IoCs. This resulted in a dataset of 7,892 web-
sites. Combined with the 21,022 potentially cryptojacking
websites from the initial crawl, a total of 25,121 URLs was
crawled on February 12, 2019, more than a month after the
initial crawl. We successfully obtained 24,187 (96%) of them.
Most of the campaigns remained of similar size in
this crawl, except for a campaign involving three keys,
ef937f99557277ff62a6fc0e5b3da90ea9550ebcdfac,
06d93b846706f4dca9996baa15d4d207e82d1e86676c and
dd27d0676efdecb12703623d6864bbe9f4e7b3f69f2e.
This advanced campaign is targeting domains using Bitrix24,
a CRM platform used by a variety of organizations. The most
remarkable website it has been found on is the website of the
Ministry of Education of Belarus (https://edu.gov.by/).
The malicious code is hidden as the core loader of Bitrix24
and uses both Nerohut and Cryptoloot to mine with. It
has a built-in anti-detection method, since it stops mining
once a developer tools window is opened. In our initial
crawl, we have identiﬁed only 68 domains belonging to
this campaign, which turned out to be 855 in our in-depth
search, making this campaign the second largest campaign
we have identiﬁed so far. Another campaign, involving key
vPfPDHk89TxmH1arysiJDrutpYGntofP, is displaying fake
loading screens on 86 websites, whereas only 47 of these
have been identiﬁed in our initial crawl.
All other campaigns remained similar or slightly smaller
in size. Except for the two aforementioned campaigns, we
conclude that our initial crawl likely identiﬁed the correct
size of campaigns, given the database of PublicWWW. Their
database contains source code snapshots of over 544M web-
sites, which should provide a proper approximation.
6.3 Evolution of cryptojacking
To study the evolution of cryptojacking on the Internet, data is
needed from different moments in time. Fortunately, Konoth
et al. [22] shared their crawling results and Hong et al. [19]
shared their list of identiﬁed cryptojacking domains, which
made it possible for us to crawl these exact same sets of
URLs and to analyze whether these domains were still mining.
Additionally, we have followed the domains identiﬁed in our
crawls over a period of 3 months, and analyzed WebSocket
proxy trafﬁc over time using operator NetFlows.
Comparison with previous crawls Konoth et al. [22]
crawled from March 12 until 19, 2018 and identiﬁed 1,735
potential cryptojacking domains. We crawled their list on
January 21, 2019 and obtained 1,725 of them. 85% of the

Figure 5: Usage evolution between March 2018 and January
2019 in the list of identiﬁed domains by [22]
websites are not cryptomining anymore, and only 10% is
still using the same application. On 136 websites (7%), the
same key was found in both crawls. As Figure 5 shows, a
large number of websites using a Coinhive miner removed
the miner application. Some continued using Coinhive, but
also a small shift into less popular mining applications can be
observed. Websites already using these miners tend to stick
to their choice and are still using the same miner almost a
year later. We have also seen a number of mining applications
become extinct, such as Deepminer and NF Webminer. Hong
et al. [19] also published the list of identiﬁed cryptojacking
domains from their crawl in February 2018. A year later, on
February 12, 2019, we have crawled this list of 2,770 domains.
We obtained 2,435 (88%) of them and only 340 (14%) do-
mains are still actively cryptojacking. Both crawls show that
a large number of websites stopped cryptojacking themselves
or removed the miner infection. After one year, approximately
85% of the domains are not actively cryptojacking anymore.
We have also observed a small portion of domains switching
to less popular applications. The low number of 7% of web-
sites that are still mining with the same siteKey indicates the
fast changes in the cryptojacking threat landscape.
Evolution of identiﬁed domains We have followed all pre-
viously identiﬁed cryptojacking domains for a period of 3
months (until May 5, 2019) and crawled them initially oc-
casionally, but afterwards every other day. Within this time
period, Coinhive announced to end its mining application, due
to decreased Monero prices and hash rate [7]. The announce-
ment was made on February 26, 2019 and stated that mining
would not be operating anymore after March 8, 2019, and that
the service would be discontinued by the end of April 2019.
This lead to a drastic change in the cryptojacking landscape,
as Coinhive’s dominance in actively mining installations col-
Figure 6: Evolution of the cryptojacking domains per type
lapsed when their mining service was set non-operationally.
Mining applications were however not massively replaced,
which conﬁrms our ﬁnding that a large portion of browser-
based cryptomining is not initiated by the website owner. Only
when the Coinhive mining service was actually discontinued
and errors were shown while requesting the ofﬂine Coinhive
mining resources, we observe a small increase in Cryptoloot
and CoinImp installations.
WebSocket proxy trafﬁc over time As discussed in Sec-
tion 2, most miner applications use a WebSocket proxy server
to forward trafﬁc from their miners to the mining pool. Using
NetFlow data mentioned earlier, we have analyzed trafﬁc to-
wards popular WebSocket proxies from September 2017 till
December 2018, which gives an insight into the evolution of
cryptomining applications usage, as shown in Figure 7. We
have taken the set of WebSocket proxy IPs the miners connect
to as a basis, which we extended by using passive DNS data
to discover other WebSocket proxy server IPs used by these
applications, but hosted on different servers, not encountered
during our crawls. The same passive DNS data was used to
verify whether these IP addresses were solely used as Web-
Socket proxy servers. To prevent other trafﬁc to these servers
from being in our dataset, we have both set the maximum
packet size to 550 kB and veriﬁed that only WebSocket trafﬁc
was counted towards these servers. For most proxies, this is
trafﬁc towards port 80 or 443, and for a few servers using
speciﬁc ports, this could be different. An example is the Web-
Socket proxy server of the WP-monero-miner which uses port
8020.
The blue line from September 2017 on shows how the web-
mining ecosystem is monopolized by innovator Coinhive at
the start, where after copycats like Cryptoloot and Webmine
start to emerge in October. We see that CoinImp essentially
starts to eclipse all other miner applications from mid April
2018 onwards in terms of mining trafﬁc to the proxies, which
is unexpected given the distribution of installations on web-
sites and previous studies. Some mining proxies only have
transient success: a remarkable example is the WP-monero-
miner, released shortly after Coinhive in 2017. The applica-

meaning that one in every 9,090 websites is cryptojacking.
Comparing this number to the statistics of the top lists used
in our initial crawl, we conclude that cryptojacking activity
is mainly focused on the popular parts of the Internet. In the
Alexa Top 1M, 0.065% of the websites was actively crypto-
jacking, in this random sample only 0.011% of the websites,
which is almost 6 times lower. This can be explained by the
lucrativeness of cryptojacking, in which a higher popularity
means more visitors, yielding more potential miners and thus
higher potential proﬁts. Additionally, it shows that research-
ing the prevalence of cryptojacking by crawling the Alexa Top
1M overestimates the problem size. However, the distribution
of used applications in our random sample is fairly similar
to the distribution in the Alexa Top 1M. The distribution of
mining applications in this crawl is listed in Table 7.
The categories of domains identiﬁed in this crawl are very
similar to the initial crawl. As depicted in Figure 8, Adult
content remains the most prevailing category, while other
large categories are Technology and Under Construction, the
