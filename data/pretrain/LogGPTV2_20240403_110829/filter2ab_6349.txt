### Title: BlackHat US-20: Demigod - The Art of Emulating Kernel Rootkits

**Abstract:**

Kernel rootkits are among the most dangerous forms of malware, operating at the highest privilege level (ring 0) in a system. This grants them unrestricted control over the entire machine, allowing them to bypass all defensive and monitoring mechanisms. Unfortunately, dynamic analysis tools for kernel rootkits are severely limited; most existing solutions are designed for user-space code (ring 3) rather than the operating system (OS) level. This limitation often forces security researchers to rely on static analysis, which is both complex and time-consuming.

This research introduces **Demigod**, a novel framework that emulates OS environments, enabling the execution of kernel rootkits within software emulators at the user-space level (ring 3). From this sandboxed environment, security analysts can safely monitor, trace, debug, and perform various types of dynamic analysis on advanced malware.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

Emulating complex OS environments such as Windows, macOS, and Linux is a significant challenge. We will discuss the technical issues we addressed, including:

- **Custom Loader and Dynamic Linker:** How we developed our own loader and dynamic linker to support the emulation.
- **OS Environment Emulation:** Techniques for emulating essential kernel components and system APIs to ensure that rootkits function correctly.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Designing and implementing Demigod as a cross-platform architecture engine capable of emulating Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD on x86, ARM, AArch64, and MIPS architectures.

**Advanced Tools and Automated Solutions:**

Built on top of Demigod, we have developed a suite of advanced tools for analyzing kernel rootkits, including automated solutions. These tools provide malware analysts with powerful new capabilities to streamline their work.

**Live Demonstrations:**

Our presentation will include a series of live demos showcasing how Demigod can be used to dissect well-known kernel rootkits on Windows, macOS, and Linux. We will also discuss how to extend Demigod to handle more sophisticated malware in the future.

**Open Source Release:**

Following our presentation, Demigod will be released as an open-source project, complete with full source code. This will enable the broader security community to benefit from and contribute to this innovative tool.

**Conclusion:**

Demigod represents a significant advancement in the field of kernel rootkit analysis, providing a robust and flexible solution for dynamic analysis. By emulating OS environments, it offers a safe and effective way to study and understand the behavior of these highly dangerous malware.
