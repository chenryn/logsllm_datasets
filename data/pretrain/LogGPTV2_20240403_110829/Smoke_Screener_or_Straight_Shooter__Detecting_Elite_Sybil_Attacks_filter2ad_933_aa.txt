## Abstract
Popular User-Review Social Networks (URSNs) such as Dianping, Yelp, and Amazon are frequent targets of reputation attacks where fake reviews are posted to manipulate the ratings of products and services. These attacks often originate from a group of accounts, called Sybils, managed by a small number of real users. A new, advanced scheme, termed "elite Sybil attacks," recruits highly-rated, organic accounts to generate seemingly trustworthy and realistic reviews. These elite Sybil accounts form a large, sparsely-knit network, making them difficult to detect with existing defense systems.

In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study to define, characterize, and detect elite Sybil attacks. We show that contemporary elite Sybil attacks have a hybrid architecture, with a first tier recruiting elite Sybil workers and distributing tasks, and a second tier posting fake reviews for profit. We design ELSIEDET, a three-stage detection scheme, which first identifies suspicious groups of users, then determines the campaign windows, and finally identifies elite Sybil users participating in the campaigns. Our large-scale empirical study on ten million reviews from Dianping, the most popular URSN in China, reveals that reviews from elite Sybil users are more temporally spread out, more convincing, and have higher filter bypass rates. We also measure the impact of Sybil campaigns on various industries and chain stores, demonstrating that monitoring elite Sybil users over time can provide valuable early alerts against such campaigns.

## 1. Introduction
User-Review Social Networks (URSNs), such as Dianping, Yelp, and Amazon, are often targeted by Sybil attacks, where multiple fake accounts, called Sybils, are used to generate fake reviews masquerading as testimonials from ordinary users. The goal is to deceive other users into making decisions favorable to the attackers. A recent trend is the emergence of elite Sybil attacks, which recruit highly-rated users (e.g., "Elite" members on Yelp or "5-star" members on Dianping) who normally post genuine, unbiased reviews. Directed by organizational leaders, these elite Sybil attackers mimic the behavior of real users, posting topically coherent content with temporal patterns consistent with genuine users. This makes elite Sybil attacks extremely difficult to detect, necessitating new approaches.

### Challenges
Previous work on defending against Sybil attacks in Online Social Networks (OSNs) has focused on two main methods: (i) investigating an account's social network connectivity, relying on established trust between users; and (ii) building machine learning classifiers based on identified features. However, these approaches are less effective in URSNs due to the following challenges:
1. **Loose Connectivity**: Nodes in URSNs do not exhibit the tight connectivity seen in general OSNs, making graph-connectivity-based approaches less effective.
2. **Professionalism**: Elite Sybil attacks in URSNs are more professional, with elaborate reviews and related pictures, making them harder to detect.
3. **Small Contribution**: Elite Sybil attackers contribute only a small fraction of overall reviews, rendering aggregate behavior-based detection ineffective.

### ELSIEDET
We design ELSIEDET, a novel Elite Sybil Detection system, to identify URSN Sybil users with elaborate camouflage. ELSIEDET focuses on Sybil campaigns involving multiple Sybil workers coordinated by a Sybil leader. These campaigns have an active period during which any user posting a review is considered suspicious. ELSIEDET is based on the observation that benign users post honest reviews based on real experiences, while Sybil users post fake reviews during the active campaign period. Over time, the more campaigns a user participates in, the more likely they are a Sybil user.

ELSIEDET consists of three stages:
1. **Detecting Sybil Communities (Phase I)**: Clustering users to identify Sybil communities.
2. **Determining Campaign Time Windows (Phase II)**: Automatically determining the start and end points of a Sybil campaign.
3. **Classifying Elite Sybil Users (Phase III)**: Using a new metric, "Sybilness," to score the extent of a user's participation in Sybil campaigns.

### Implementation and Evaluation
We implement ELSIEDET and evaluate its performance on a large-scale dataset from Dianping, the most popular URSN in China. Our dataset, crawled from January 1, 2014, to June 15, 2015, includes 10,541,931 reviews, 32,940 stores, and 3,555,154 users. We find that over 108,100 reviews are fake, generated by 21,871 regular Sybil users and 12,292 elite Sybil users. These Sybil users belong to 566 Sybil communities, which launched 2,164 Sybil campaigns. Our research shows that Dianping's current filtering system is ineffective, as less than 33.7% of fake reviews have been filtered. Manual inspection confirms that 90.7% of randomly sampled suspicious users are elite Sybil users, and 93.8% of the 1,000 most suspicious users are elite Sybil users. We have reported our findings to Dianping, which acknowledged our results.

### Key Findings
- **Economic Motivation**: Elite Sybil users, motivated by higher economic rewards, employ sophisticated techniques to evade detection, including coordinating posting times and crafting polished reviews.
- **Industry Impact**: Cinemas, hotels, and restaurants are the most active in hiring Sybil users for promotions. Specifically, 30.2% of cinemas, 7.7% of hotels, and 5.5% of restaurants are involved in Sybil campaigns.
- **Chain Stores**: 12.4% of Sybil communities post fake reviews for chain stores, with overhyped chain stores often using the same Sybil communities.
- **Early Detection**: More than 50% of Sybil campaigns can be detected within the first two weeks by monitoring elite Sybil users, allowing for timely defense.

### Contributions
- **Hybrid Architecture**: We show that Dianping's Sybil organization has evolved to a hybrid architecture.
- **New Type of Sybil Users**: We identify and characterize elite Sybil users, who employ sophisticated evasion strategies.
- **Early-Warning System**: We propose an early-warning system to detect online Sybil campaigns.
- **Complementary System**: ELSIEDET complements Dianping's current filtering system, as verified by manual inspection and feedback from Dianping.

### Ethical Considerations
We collected only publicly available review information and did not process users' private data. We did not craft fake reviews and have alerted Dianping about our findings. We are currently discussing the potential deployment of our system at Dianping.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Dianping: A User-Review Social Network
Dianping is the most popular URSN in China, where users can review local businesses such as restaurants, hotels, and stores. Reviews are rated from 1 to 5 stars, and users are assigned star-ratings from 0 (rookie) to 6 (expert). High-starred users, similar to "Elite Users" on Yelp, are considered experts and have a significant impact on their local community. Dianping classifies reviews into "normal reviews" and "filtered reviews," but the details of the filtering algorithm are not public.

### 2.2 Sybil Attacks
Social media platforms, populated by millions of users, present economic and political incentives for malicious entities to emulate and alter human behavior. Earlier Sybil attacks were designed to harm through rumors, spam, malware, and misinformation. As detection systems improve, the arms race continues, with increasingly sophisticated Sybils on platforms like Twitter. For example, Sybils can post material at predetermined times, emulating human temporal patterns. This evolutionary chain of Sybil attacks imposes a new challenge for detection systems.
