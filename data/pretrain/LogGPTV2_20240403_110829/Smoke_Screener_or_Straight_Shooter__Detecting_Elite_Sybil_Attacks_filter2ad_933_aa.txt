Abstract—Popular User-Review Social Networks (URSNs)—
such as Dianping, Yelp, and Amazon—are often the targets of
reputation attacks in which fake reviews are posted in order to
boost or diminish the ratings of listed products and services.
These attacks often emanate from a collection of accounts,
called Sybils, which are collectively managed by a group of
real users. A new advanced scheme, which we term elite Sybil
attacks, recruits organically highly-rated accounts to generate
seemingly-trustworthy and realistic-looking reviews. These elite
Sybil accounts taken together form a large-scale sparsely-knit
Sybil network for which existing Sybil
fake-review defense
systems are unlikely to succeed.
In this paper, we conduct the ﬁrst study to deﬁne, characterize,
and detect elite Sybil attacks. We show that contemporary elite
Sybil attacks have a hybrid architecture, with the ﬁrst tier
recruiting elite Sybil workers and distributing tasks by Sybil
organizers, and with the second tier posting fake reviews for
proﬁt by elite Sybil workers. We design ELSIEDET, a three-
stage Sybil detection scheme, which ﬁrst separates out suspicious
groups of users, then identiﬁes the campaign windows, and ﬁnally
identiﬁes elite Sybil users participating in the campaigns. We
perform a large-scale empirical study on ten million reviews
from Dianping, by far the most popular URSN service in
China. Our results show that reviews from elite Sybil users are
more spread out temporally, craft more convincing reviews, and
have higher ﬁlter bypass rates. We also measure the impact
of Sybil campaigns on various industries (such as cinemas,
hotels, restaurants) as well as chain stores, and demonstrate that
monitoring elite Sybil users over time can provide valuable early
alerts against Sybil campaigns.

generate fake reviews that masquerade as testimonials from
ordinary people. The goal of the attack is to deceive ordinary
users into making decisions favorable to the attackers. A
recent evolutionary trend is a new type of Sybil attack in
contemporary URSNs, which we call elite Sybil attacks. Elite
Sybil attacks recruit highly-rated users (e.g., “Elite” member
on Yelp or “5-star” member on Dianping) who normally post
genuine reviews, unbiased by ﬁnancial incentives. Directed
by organizational
leaders, elite Sybil attackers mimic the
behavior of real users by posting topically coherent content
with temporal patterns consistent with real users. Because
elite Sybil users’ review behavior greatly resembles that of
genuine users, elite Sybil attacks are extremely difﬁcult to
algorithmically or manually detect. Therefore, new approaches
are needed to detect elite Sybil accounts rapidly and accurately.
Challenges. Previous work on defending against Sybil attacks
in Online Social Networks (OSNs) aims to identify fake or
compromised accounts mainly by two means: (i) investigating
an account’s social network connectivity [10, 21, 41, 49, 50]
relying on the trust
is established in existing social
connections between users; (ii) building machine learning
classiﬁers with a set of identiﬁed features [13, 35, 52]. The
literature on Sybil defense schemes mostly targets general
OSNs, and almost no reasons are tailored toward a situational
logic behind that attack, much less pay attention to Sybil
defenses in URSNs, such as Yelp and Dianping. URSNs
pose the following three unique challenges. (i) The nodes
in URSNs do not exhibit
tight connectivity as in general
OSNs, rendering graph-connectivity based approaches less
effective in URSNs. (ii) Elite Sybil attacks in URSNs are more
professional, writing elaborate reviews and posting related
pictures to imitate real reviews. Thus, Sybil attacks in URSNs
are more difﬁcult to detect than those in traditional OSNs. (iii)
Since elite Sybil attackers only contribute to a small fraction of
overall reviews, the existing Sybil detection approaches based
on the similarity of aggregate behavior do not work well. To
address all these challenges and deﬁciencies, a novel Sybil
detection technique for elite Sybil users is highly desired.

ELSIEDET. In this work, we design a novel Elite Sybil
Detection system, ELSIEDET, which can identify URSN Sybil
users with elaborate camouﬂage. Different from previous
studies, we focus our design on Sybil campaigns that have
multiple Sybil workers colluding to perform a task (e.g., post-
ing positive reviews and high ratings for a speciﬁc restaurant)
under the coordination of a Sybil leader. These campaigns have
an active time period. Any user who posts during the active
time period is suspicious to be part of the campaign. This user
could either be a benign user who happens to visit the store
and post her review in the campaign period, or a Sybil user
who posts fake reviews speciﬁcally for the campaign. We build
ELSIEDET based on the following empirical observations: A
benign user posts honest reviews based on her real experience
while a Sybil user always posts fake reviews during the active
time period of the Sybil campaigns. Therefore, in the long run,
the more campaigns a user gets involved in, the more likely
she is a Sybil user.
ELSIEDET is designed with three stages: detecting a Sybil
community (Phase I), determining the Sybil campaign time
window (Phase II), and ﬁnally classifying elite Sybil users
(Phase III). In Phase I, since Sybil users collaborate to post
fake reviews in a Sybil campaign, ELSIEDET exploits this
group behavior to cluster users and identify Sybil communi-
ties. In Phase II, ELSIEDET uses a novel campaign detection
algorithm to automatically determine the start and end points
of a Sybil campaign, while ruling out reviews not belonging
to a Sybil task. Lastly, in Phase III, we propose a novel
elite Sybil detection algorithm to separate out elite Sybil
users from undetected users based on a new deﬁned metric,
Sybilness, which scores the extent a user participates in the
Sybil campaign.
We implement ELSIEDET and evaluate its performance on
a large-scale dataset from Dianping, by far the most popular
URSN in China. Our dataset was crawled from January 1,
2014 to June 15, 2015 and includes 10, 541, 931 reviews,
32, 940 stores, and 3, 555, 154 users. We show that, of all
the reviews, more than 108, 100 reviews are fake reviews,
which were generated by 21, 871 regular Sybil users and
12, 292 elite Sybil users. These Sybil users belong to 566 Sybil
communities, which launched 2, 164 Sybil campaigns. Our
research shows that the current ﬁltering system of Dianping
is ineffective at detecting fake reviews generated by the elite
Sybil users since less than 33.7% of the fake reviews have
been ﬁltered by Dianping. Finally, through manual inspection,
we conclude that 90.7% of randomly sampled suspicious users
are elite Sybil users, and 93.8% of the 1, 000 most suspicious
users are elite Sybil users. We have reported all of our ﬁndings
to Dianping, which acknowledged our detection results.
Findings. Our study reveals the following main ﬁndings about
the operation logistics of elite Sybil attacks.
• Motivated by economic revenue on black markets (e.g.,
an elite Sybil user can receive up to 20 times more
income than a regular Sybil user for the same task),
elite Sybil users have developed a series of techniques to
evade the Sybil detection systems, including coordinating
the posting time and crafting carefully-polished review
contents and pictures.
• We evaluate the impact of Sybil attacks on different
categories of industry. Surprisingly, cinemas, hotels, and
restaurants are the most active in hiring Sybil users for
promotions. In particular, 30.2% of cinemas, 7.7% of
hotels, and 5.5% of restaurants are actively involved in
Sybil campaigns.
• We observe that 12.4% of Sybil communities post fake
reviews for chain stores, which is different from recent re-
search performed on Yelp [27]. What is more interesting
is that that overhyped chain stores with the same brand
recruit the same Sybil communities for Sybil campaigns.
• We ﬁnd that more than 50% of Sybil campaigns can be
determined within the ﬁrst two weeks by only observing
activities of elite Sybil users, thereby allowing the URSN
to defend against the attack while in progress.
Contributions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the
ﬁrst to study elite Sybil detection in URSNs. In summary, we
make the following key contributions:
1) We show that the Sybil organization of Dianping has
evolved to a hybrid architecture, rather than a prevalent
centralized or a simple distributed system [34, 45].
2) We identify a new type of Sybil users, elite Sybil
users, which employ a sophisticated strategy for evading
detection and have never been studied before.
3) We characterize the behaviors of elite Sybil users and
propose an early-warning system to detect online Sybil
campaigns.
4) We show that ELSIEDET complements the Dianping’s
current ﬁltering system, which has been veriﬁed by both
our own manual inspection and the feedback received
from Dianping.
Roadmap. The remainder of this paper is structured as
follows: Section II introduces the necessary background on
Dianping and Sybil attacks while Section III deﬁnes elite Sybil
attacks. In Section IV, we propose our Sybil detection system.
Section V evaluates the experimental performance, whereas
Section VI provides detailed measurements of elite Sybil users
and Sybil communities. Section VII discusses applications and
limitations of the study. Section VIII surveys the related work.
Finally, Section IX concludes the paper.
A. Ethical Considerations
In this paper, we only collected publicly available review
information and its relation with stores on Dianping. We do not
crawl, store, or process users’ privacy information including
usernames, gender, small proﬁle pictures, or tags that often
accompany the user proﬁles. Furthermore, we did not craft
fake reviews in order to ensure that our experiments do not
have a negative impact on Dianping’s services. Finally, we
have alerted Dianping about the discoveries and results made
in this paper. We are currently discussing possibilities of our
system deployment at Dianping.

II. BACKGROUND
III. DISSECTING ELITE SYBIL ATTACKS
In this section, we ﬁrst brieﬂy describe Dianping. We then
summarize traditional Sybil attacks and the recent trend on
User-Review Social Networks (URSNs).
A. Dianping: A User-Review Social Network
Dianping is by far the most popular URSN in China, where
users can review local businesses such as restaurants, hotels,
and stores. When a user uses Dianping, Dianping will return
to the user with a list of choices in order of overall quality-
rating. The quality-rating of a restaurant review is typically
scaled from 1 star (worst) to 5 star (best), mainly depending
on the restaurant service. Users are also assigned star-ratings.
These star-ratings vary from 0 stars (rookie) to 6 stars (expert),
depending on the longevity of the user account, the number
of reviews posted, etc. A higher star-rating indicates that the
user is more experienced and more likely to be perceived as
an expert reviewer. Similar to “Elite User” on Yelp, a senior
level user (e.g., 4-star, 5-star, or 6-star user) is supposed to
be a small group of in-the-know users who have a large
impact on their local community. Dianping has established
its user reputation system that classiﬁes user reviews into
“normal reviews” and “ﬁltered reviews.” The latter includes
the uninformative reviews or the suspicious reviews that are
potentially manipulated by the Sybil attackers, but the details
of the algorithm remain unknown to the public.
B. Sybil Attacks
Social media platforms populated by millions of users
present either economic or political incentives to develop algo-
rithms to emulate and possibly alter human behavior. Earlier
Sybil attacks include malicious entities designed particularly
with the purpose to harm. These Sybil users mislead, exploit,
and manipulate social media discourse with rumors, spam,
malware, misinformation, slander, or even just noise [19, 20].
This type of abuse has also been observed during the 2016
US presidential election [2]. As better detection systems are
built, we witness an arms race similar to what we observed
for spam alike in the past. In recent years, Twitter Sybils
have become increasingly sophisticated, making their detec-
tion more difﬁcult. For example, Sybils can post collected
material searched from websites at predetermined times, emu-
lating the human temporal signature of content production and
consumption [17]. In the meantime, the arms race has also
driven the corresponding countermeasures [7, 11, 13, 40].
The evolutionary chain of Sybil attacks imposes a novel
