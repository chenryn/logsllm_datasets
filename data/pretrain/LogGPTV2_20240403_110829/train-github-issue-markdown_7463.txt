Challenge escaping-literal-quotes-in-strings has an issue.

In this challenge there is a single quote given in a single string that they
used the escape method for. The challenge states to do it with two quotes
within a single string. The lay out of my code is the same as the one in the
example. There is no output appearing to even tell me what the error is it is
just telling me to keep trying. There is no error icons where my code window
is either so I don't even know what I'm doing wrong so I feel very strongly
this is a bug issue rather than input issue.
    var myStr=" I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
