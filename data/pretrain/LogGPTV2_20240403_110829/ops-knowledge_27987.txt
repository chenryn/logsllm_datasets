User: Simply moving the file to ~/.Trash/ will not work, as if the file os on an external drive, it will move the file to the main system drive..
Also, there are other conditions, like files on external drives get moved to /Volumes/.Trash/501/ (or whatever the current user's ID is)
Given a file or folder path, what is the correct way to determine the trash folder? I imagine the language is pretty irrelevant, but I intend to use Python
Assistant: The File Manager API has a pair of functions called FSMoveObjectToTrashAsync and FSPathMoveObjectToTrashSync.
Not sure if that is exposed to Python or not.
