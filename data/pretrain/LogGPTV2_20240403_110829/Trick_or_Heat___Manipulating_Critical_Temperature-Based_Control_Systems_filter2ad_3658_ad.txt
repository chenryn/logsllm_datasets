5.2 Laboratory Applications
5.2.1 Biological Laboratory Equipment. Temperature-based sys-
tems are widely used in biological laboratory equipment to preserve
biological samples or control the temperature during critical experi-
ments. These equipment are usually well-designed and are expected
to control the temperature accurately because an unstable temper-
ature environment can devastate valuable biological samples or
bias the outcomes of experiments. However, in our experiments,
we demonstrate how they can be maliciously compromised by ad-
versaries.
We investigate our attacks on a hybridization oven and an in-
cufridge. The UVP HB-500 hybridization oven accurately controls
the temperature of samples in the hybridization process, enabling
consistent saturation of sample solutions. It has an internal temper-
ature sensor and is shielded with metal panels, but the gaps between
these panels could allow EMI signals to pass through and affect
internal circuit components. With an attack distance of 1 m, an
adversary can maliciously increase the temperature measurement
by 5.6◦C and trick the hybridization oven to cool down.
The Revolutionary Science RS-IF-202 incufridge can be used
to refrigerate or incubate specimens and biological products [4].
The incufridge has an internal temperature sensor and is well-
shielded with metal panels. However, we find that EMI signals
could enter through the control panel of the device, which can
be exploited to spoof its temperature sensor measurement. In the
experiments, we use a transmitting power of 4 W, and we summarize
the experimental results in Fig. 12.
5.2.2 Thermal Chambers. Thermal chambers can provide an accur-
ately controlled thermal environment for automatic environmental
tests of critical components such as aircraft electronics, satellite
antennas, and implantable stents [26]. Adversarial control or dis-
ruptions of these systems could damage expensive components or
make the results of environmental tests unreliable.
We investigate our attacks on a Sun Electronic Systems EC12
thermal chamber that is intended for automated test systems and
laboratory applications [5]. This well-shielded metal chamber is
equipped with two K-type thermocouples: The first one (thermal
chamber sensor) is hidden behind the control panel and it measures

chamber with different attack distances using a transmit-
ting power of 3.2 W. Note that the injection affect both the
sensors in similar way despite the chamber shield.
the internal temperature of the chamber; The second one (the user
probe) can be used to directly monitor the temperature of the device
under test. We set and maintain the temperature of the chamber
at 30◦C, then we turn off the heater circuit breaker to ensure that
only the temperature offset caused by the attack is measured. In
our experiments, we point the antenna towards the double-paned
glass window of the chamber and sweep a frequency range of 550
MHz to 1.6 GHz using a transmitting power of 35 dBm, which
is equivalent to 3.2 W. We monitor the temperature variations in
both the thermal chamber probe and the user probe. Although the
sensors are placed in different locations of the chamber and the
thermal chamber sensor is protected by a metal internal panel, our
attack induces similar effects on both of the sensors simultaneously
(Fig. 13). We also measure the maximum increases or decreases that
can be induced in the temperature measurements with different
attack distances.
3D Printers. In 3D printers, extruders are crucial components
5.2.3
that are responsible for heating and expelling the building mater-
ial (filament). The temperature control system of an extruder con-
stantly monitors and adjusts the temperature of its heating chamber.
During the building process, the temperature of the heating cham-
ber must be kept within a certain tolerance range to ensure the
quality of the build and prevent buildups of the filament [38]. Com-
promising the temperature sensor reliability in this fundamental
phase could disrupt the printing process or damage the product
quality. We investigate our attacks on two different extruder models:
the MakerBot Smart Extruder and the MakerBot Smart Extruder
+ (Plus). We install these extruders onto two identical MakerBot
Replicators 3D printers. Both of the two models use K-type shielded
thermocouple sensors. Note that we do not turn on the extruder
heating/cooling cycle to prevent damage to the heating chamber.
We wait until the temperature of the extruder naturally reaches the
equilibrium at room temperature (23◦C) before starting the attack.
We test the frequency range of 400 MHz to 1 GHz, observing
the temperature change of the extruder on the 3D printer’s display.
During the test, we observe two main effects: 1) With an attack
frequency of 400 MHz, the user panels of both of extruder models
show that the extruder temperature is zero. Even after reloading
the extruder monitoring system, the displayed temperature remains

With a frequency of 400 MHz, the attack causes the discon-
nection of the extruder (left, middle). With an attack fre-
quency of 1 GHz, the temperature perceived is 10◦C higher
than the actual temperature of 23◦C (right).
zero (Fig. 14 left). When we start the “preheat" functionality, the
device displays an extruder disconnection error message (Fig. 14
middle). 2) With an attack frequency of 1 GHz, we can increase the
temperature measurement of the Smart Extruder Plus by a max-
imum of 10 ◦C compared to the baseline temperature (Fig. 14 right).
In this case, the system does not give any error messages or special
indications in the user panel when the measured extruder temper-
ature is changed. Therefore, adversaries can spoof the temperature
measurement to manipulate the temperature control system in the
extruder without being detected by the system. In the experiments,
we use a transmitting power of 3.2 W and we are able to induce a
temperature change of 0.5◦C at a maximum attack distance of 25
cm.
5.3 Consumer PID Controllers
We study the effect of our attacks on three consumer PID control
modules: the Inkbird ITC-100VH, ITC-1000F, ITC-100RH. Although
the modules we test are mainly used in IoT applications, devices
with similar functions can be found in critical industrial and man-
ufacturing applications [20–22]. The three modules are equipped
with different types of temperature sensors. These devices can be
used to limit or maintain the temperature of a target environment in
a specific range. When the device detects a temperature that is out
of the predefined range, it can raise the alarm to alert users or switch
on/off the circuit of a heating or cooling element. Manipulation of
temperature measurements can undermine the alarm function even
when the actual temperature is out of the predefined range. Our
experiments show that these modules are not well-shielded and can
be susceptible to adversarial control with a relatively long attack
distance. For instance, from a distance of 2 m, the attack can mali-
ciously increase the temperature measurement of the ITC-100RH
controller by a maximum of 32.9◦C with an attack frequency of 453
MHz and a transmitting power of 4 W.
6 COUNTERMEASURES
Usually manufacturers implement filters to reduce external and
internal electromagnetic interference, such as common-mode or
differential-mode filters on the amplifier input [67]. However, as we
demonstrate in our work, out-of-band EMI can induce AC signals
that bypass generic filtering and be internally rectified through
the amplifier input, output, or power supply pins. Although EMI
defenses are known and some are already applied to certain critical
applications [83], consumer electronics are less protected against
malicious attacks that affect temperature sensors. In this section, we
discuss and simulate several passive and active methods to detect
or prevent EMI effects on temperature sensors.
6.1 Hardware Defenses
Traditional hardware defenses can take various forms according to
the level of mitigation adopted and cost/performance limitations.
Shielding. Designing short shielded wires between the temperat-
ure sensors and amplifier inputs is a good practice to avoid long
leads acting as antennas and picking up interference. However, the
common-mode noise induced by the antenna can become normal
mode at the point where the cables are connected to the circuit. This
happens because of the difference between the terminal impedance
of the cable and the terminal impedance of receiver circuit [79]. In
this case, a mitigation of the attack consists in adding terminating
resistors to the contact points. EMI enclosures can also be used
to block interference. However, openings in the shield are often
required to accommodate switches, connectors, indicators, or to
provide ventilation. These openings may compromise shielding
effectiveness by providing paths for high-frequency interference to
enter the circuit board [63]. Moreover, it requires a careful thermal
modeling of the system [58]. Another approach consists of sensor
shielding when the temperature sensor needs to be externally ex-
posed. In this case, shielding is only effective against interference
if it provides a low impedance path to ground. However, some data
acquisition systems require the temperature sensor to be grounded,
such as thermocouple or RTD probes used in industrial processes
[69]. When both the shield and temperature sensors are grounded,
a ground-loop current can appear to the amplifier input terminals
due to the difference of potential developed between the sensor
ground and the amplifier ground connection [31]. When the EMI
induces common mode noise, the interference can pass through
the ground of the shield, creating a ground-loop current that can
potentially generate the rectification effect. Some techniques can re-
duce but not eliminate the phenomenon, such as making the shield
connection to ground as close as possible to the sensor connection
to ground, or using only the ground terminal of the amplifier to
connect to the shield without connecting the shield to the amplifier
end.
Active and Passive Filters. In the case of op-amps and in-amps,
manufacturers apply low-pass filters at the amplifier input pins
to reduce the EMI signal energy from the input lines. In IC tem-
perature sensors that use an inverting op-amp (e.g., LM35), a filter
capacitor is placed between equal value resistors, while in IC tem-
perature sensors (e.g., LM335) that use non-inverting op-amp, the
filter capacitor is directly connected to the op-amp input. Precision
in-amps in RTD and thermocouples sensors use two low-pass fil-
ters to suppress common-mode signals in each input lane and one
capacitor to suppress differential-mode signals between the two
amplifiers input terminals [3]. These filters are not sufficient for
a complete attack mitigation due to the lines asymmetry and fre-
quency range with respect to our injected interference. For example,
in thermocouples, the asymmetry between the lines is exacerbated
due to the two different conductors tied together. For these reasons,
high precision temperature instruments contain additional isolation
circuits and active low-pass filters connected to the amplifier input
terminals to isolate the field-side and system-side circuitry [15].
Session 10A: Cyberphysical SecurityCCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom2310Choke-based filters can be also used as alternative for in-amp
input filtering [54]. Despite the good noise suppression, the ma-
terials used for the inductance cores can heavily affect the filter
performance for high frequency EMI, making the system vulnerable
to injection attacks [81].
Amplifier outputs also need to be protected from EMI, since
the interference injected on an output line couples back into the
amplifier input where they are rectified and appear again on the
output as a DC offset. An RC filter and/or a ferrite bead in series with
the amplifier output are the simplest and inexpensive solutions to
reduce the DC offset. However, for temperature systems, the output
filtering is often limited to the line frequency and its harmonics (50
Hz/60 Hz) due to the interference noise generated when systems
operate from the main power supply [36, 60].
6.2 Software Defenses
Many current temperature control systems use multiple sensors
to continuously monitor the thermal state of different measure-
ment points, or as multiple temperature reference values [3, 42].
In critical infrastructure sectors such as energy and healthcare, re-
dundant sensors are used to generate time-dependent estimates of
the critical points [47, 68]. Similar to sensor redundancy, sensor
fusion techniques might be used to combine data from different
sensors in order to produce the best estimation of the true state
of a system and decrease the system’s dependence on a single
sensor [46]. In systems that rely on temperature sensors, literature
provides various software countermeasures based on sensor fusion
[55, 57]. However, in our experiments we demonstrate how phys-
ical proximity causes similar temperature sensors to be affected
by similar attack effects (see Fig. 13). In turn, this increases the
difficulty for a sensor fusion algorithm to detect the anomalies
in small and self-contained systems, such as thermal chambers,
or incubators. In addition, complex sensor fusion techniques re-
quire building models of the attacks effects on different sensors,
using machine learning-based or statistical techniques to recognize
the anomalies [53]. Therefore, to cover all the possible attack ef-
fects, these approaches require accurate parameter tuning and an
exhaustive training phase. This might not be feasible to achieve.
Furthermore, if the attack gradually changes the sensor data, or
the operating conditions of the system change overtime, the sensor
fusion algorithms might not be able to recognize the attack from
the normal system behavior.
Another protection method uses a composition of instrumentation
amplifiers: three in-amps, two of these correlated to one another
and connected in antiphase [54].
Other techniques focus on detecting injection attacks at the
process level. A process-level intrusion detection system monitors
sensors to determine if the physical process drifts from the normal
or expected behavior. Common approaches include building Lin-
ear Dynamical State-Space (LDS) models of the physical process,
or use machine learning and data mining to detect anomalies in
the system behavior [29]. Although such approaches might detect
anomalous events, models are difficult to build, as they require
high effort in simulating and testing all possible attack vectors,
and building a complete and highly detailed model of the physical
process and interaction is not always feasible. Furthermore, ma-
chine learning methods that do not require a model of the physical
process involve critical feature extraction and parameter-tuning
phases that are often hard to automate and update on the discovery
of a new attack vector. In addition, the systems that implement
these kind of techniques need to continuously check if each sensor
measurement drifts from the normal behavior captured during
the training phase, drastically augmenting the computational and
power resource costs.
Sensor redundancy, process-based techniques, and sensor fusion
may significantly increase the effort an adversary must make to
conduct an attack. However, implementing sophisticated software-
based defenses remains arduous in large-scale consumer electronic
devices.
6.3 Hardware Anomaly Detection System
For critical applications where it is not possible to implement com-
plete shielding, or an effective mitigation filtering of the system and
the sensor(s) - such as incubators - detecting the presence of attack
attempts becomes crucial for verifying and maintaining temperat-
ure data reliability. A detection circuit can be used as a trigger for
emergency measures - such as activating a safe mode where the sys-
tem restricts its reliance on sensor data. To defend against EMI on
cardiac implantable medical devices, Foo Kune et al. [56] proposed
a cardiac probe to cross-check whether readings from a cardiac
signal coincides with the expected values. Wang et al. [80] proposed
an additional microphone to detect resonating sound that can affect
MEMS gyroscopes. Based on our results, an effective defense for
temperature-sensor-based systems that maintains the reliability of
the temperature data should account for the frequencies that can
induce a rectification effect in the amplifier output signal. Based on
this frequency analysis, manufacturers can modify the design of
their system to detect and react to attacks in the frequency bands of
EMI signals. We propose a hardware anomaly detector to identify
malicious signal and provide feedback about the reliability of the
measurement data.
Design of the Anomaly Detector. The EMI signal induced by our
attack can appear in many different points close to the amplifier
where isolation circuitry and filters don’t properly block the high
frequency signals. A detector that can measure these signals can
be implemented by connecting a low noise amplifier (LNA) and
a band-pass filter to the points (such as a trace or wire) sensitive
to the malicious signal (Fig. 15). By adopting the superheterodyne
technique typical of AM receivers [74], the EMI frequency bands
that cause significant DC offset variations can be down-converted to
an intermediate frequency (IF). Down-conversion can be achieved
by using a mixer and local oscillator. As a result, the use of this
