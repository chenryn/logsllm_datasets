## Abstract
The abundance of highly sensitive personal information in Health Information Systems (HIS) makes them prime targets for data breach attacks. However, securing these systems with existing Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) solutions is challenging due to the lack of a well-defined security perimeter and the diverse composition of software components. We propose using hypervisor-based memory introspection to detect data leakage in such environments. This approach searches for sensitive raw data in the memory of both client and server machines, transcending the limitations of pre-existing security perimeters. It is inherently compatible with different types of application software and robust against transport or at-rest data encryption. A prototype has been built on the Bareflank hypervisor and the OpenEMR platform. Evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

## 1. Introduction
The healthcare industry relies heavily on data from laboratory tests, medical imaging, and various measurement devices for diagnosis. Hospitals maintain medical records to track patient histories and exchange prescription data with pharmacies. Insurance companies also require access to medical records for claims processing. Most of this data is private, making it a lucrative target for both external and insider attacks. Deploying data loss prevention systems in such environments is challenging due to the lack of well-defined security perimeters and the diverse composition of custom software.

To address this, we propose a novel data leakage detection system based on memory introspection and pattern recognition. Unlike traditional DLP systems that monitor system-level access events and network traffic, our system is robust against transport layer encryption (e.g., TLS) and at-rest data encryption (e.g., disk encryption). By directly examining the raw contents in memory, our system is largely message format-agnostic and compatible with different types of custom software. In the following sections, we introduce the design of the system, the implementation of the prototype, and present preliminary evaluation results.

## 2. Data Leakage Detection for Health Information System
### 2.1 Hypervisor-based Memory Introspection
We use the Bareflank lightweight hypervisor to map the physical memory space to the data leakage detection daemon for memory introspection. The hypervisor ensures the integrity of the detection mechanism by preventing user-level or kernel-level malware from compromising it. Memory introspection can reveal sensitive information that is encrypted at rest or during transport. We map the target memory content to the address space of the data leakage detection daemon by modifying the Extended Page Tables (EPT) entries, as shown in Figure 1(b).

### 2.2 Structured Data Extraction
After mapping the physical memory space to the address space of the data leakage detection daemon, the daemon reconstructs the process memory structure from the memory frames using Volatility's `linux_pslist`. It then identifies processes of interest (e.g., OpenEMR or web browsers) and acquires access to their virtual address space via `linux_proc_maps` and `mm_struct`. The daemon uses heuristics to find images and texts in the application’s memory space. Algorithm 1 illustrates the heuristics for finding .jpg images.

**Algorithm 1: Heuristics for Finding .jpg Images**
```python
def heuristics(image):
    array = process_memory
    for i in range(len(array)):
        # Check the header format
        if start_marker == jpg_start_marker_format:
            start_marker[4] = array[i:i+4]
            length = (array[i+4] * 256) + array[i+5]
            next_marker[4] = array[i+length+4:i+length+8]
            if next_marker == jpg_next_marker:
                length2 = (array[i+length+6] * 256) + array[i+length+7]
                next_marker2[1] = array[i+length+length2+6]
                if next_marker2 == jpg_next_marker2:
                    possible_jpg.append(array[i])
                else:
                    continue
            else:
                continue
        else:
            continue
    for i in range(len(possible_jpg)):
        build_possible_jpg()
        # Reach end marker 0xFFD9
        output_possible_jpg_files()
```

## 3. Sensitive Data Identification
Images obtained from structured data extraction are fed into a Mask Regional-Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) model, as shown in Figure 2. The model scans the medical image and generates proposals with a high probability of containing objects. It uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate these proposals. Mask R-CNN then identifies and classifies the generated proposals to detect sensitive data in medical images [8].
