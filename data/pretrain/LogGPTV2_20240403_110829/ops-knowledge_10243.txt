User: I'm working on a variscite board with a yocto distribution and python 2.7.3.  
I get sometimes a Bus error message from the python interpreter.
My program runs normally at least some hours or days before the error ocours.
But when I get it once, I get it directly when I try to restart my program.
I have to reboot before the system works again.  
My program uses only a serial port, a bit usb communication and some tcp sockets.  
I can switch to another hardware and get the same problems.  
I also used the python selftest with
python -c "from test import testall"
And I get errors for these two tests

test_getattr (test.test_builtin.BuiltinTest) ... ERROR test_nameprep
  (test.test_codecs.NameprepTest) ... ERROR

And the selftest stops always at 

test_callback_register_double (ctypes.test.test_callbacks.SampleCallbacksTestCase) ... Segmentation
  fault

But when the systems runs some hours the selftests stops earlier at

ctypes.macholib.dyld
  Bus error

I checked the RAM with memtester, it seems to be okay.
How I can find the cause for the problems?
Assistant: Bus errors are generally caused by applications trying to access memory that hardware cannot physically address. In your case there is a segmentation fault which may cause dereferencing a bad pointer or something similar which leads to accessing a memory address which physically is not addressable. I'd start by root causing the segmentation fault first as the bus error is the secondary symptom.
