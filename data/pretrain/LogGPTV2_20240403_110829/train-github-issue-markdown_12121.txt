# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
Using webpack in the electron js app I can't import native module libraries
like `ffi-napi`, `ref-napi`, etc in my application. Libraries like those
generally expects node's `__dirname` to set as global. Thus, setting `node:
{__dirname: true}` would work in my app but in the `production` built it
throws a runtime error:
    Error: No native build was found for platform=darwin arch=x64 runtime=electron abi=87 uv=1 libc=glibc node=14.16.0 electron=12.0.6 webpack=true
The same above error would throws if I change/remove `node:{__dirname: false}`
or `node` property itself from the webpack config.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
I'm not sure on this whether its a bug or not. But to reproduce the scenario
here's my example repo which can show the issue in more details. Basically,
##### to reproduce an error
  * start the app by `npm start`
  * then an error would shown up
##### to get working
  * change the `__dirname` to `true` in the `webpack.config.js` and again
  * start the app by `npm start`
  * now it runs OK. To confirm if native module `ffi-napi`, `ref-napi` are working properly - goto View > Toggle Developer Tools and in the console tab = `Add: 8`
**What is the expected behavior?**  
If I need to set `node:{__dirname: true}` in this case (which works in the
`development` mode) then the same behavior is expected to be working in the
`production` mode (in the installer). Otherwise, if there is/are other work
around to fix then still the expectation is same as to the `development` mode
at the moment.
