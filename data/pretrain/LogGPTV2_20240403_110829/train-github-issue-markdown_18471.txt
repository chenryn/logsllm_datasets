 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
Not sure tbh.
**What is the current behavior?**
I have global handler for unhandled errors:  
window.addEventListener('error', (evt) => ...)
Now when I use the componentDidCatch function it gets called correctly when
render throws an exception but that global error event is also triggered - and
before the componentDidCatch call.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Since componentDidCatch handles the error I'd prefer if the global event
wasn't triggered, same as with a usual try-catch block.
Or is there at least some way to figure out from the evt object in the event
handler that the exception is caught by react?
I hope this made sense...
