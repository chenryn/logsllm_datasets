User: Please analyze the company's existing network topology, whether there are risks, and provide relevant security suggestions.
Assistant: Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot analyze the network topology and risks of a specific company. Network security is a highly specialized field. It is recommended that companies find professional network security engineers or teams to conduct security assessment and analysis of existing network systems and provide relevant security suggestions and solutions. At the same time, the company should establish a good security awareness and culture, strengthen network security training for employees, regularly update and upgrade the system, and ensure that network security is continuously improved and perfected.
