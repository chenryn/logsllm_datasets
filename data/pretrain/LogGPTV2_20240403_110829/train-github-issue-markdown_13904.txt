I often find myself doing some quick-and-dirty plotting, and wishing there was
a simple, one-step, easy-to-remember way to set the default figsize for all
matplotlib plots.
I imagine something very light-weight like `sns.set(figsize=(2, 4))` or
`sns.set_figsize(2, 4)`.
iPython actually has this already as `IPython.core.pylabtools.figsize(sizex,
sizey)`.
I can submit a pull request pretty easily, but I wanted to ask you opinion
first.
