GUESSING STATISTICS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS OF YAHOO! USERS.
Table IV
actively used different Yahoo! services. Users who have
used Yahoo!’s online retail platform (which means they have
stored a payment card) do choose very weak passwords
with lower frequency, with ˜λ10 increasing by about 2 bits.
However, the distribution is indistinguishable from average
users against ofﬂine attack. A similar phenomenon occurs
for users of some other features, such as media sharing
or dedicated smartphone clients for Android, Blackberry,
or iOS, which see slightly better security against online
attacks but are indistinguishable otherwise. Other popular
features, such as webmail, chat, and social networking, saw
slightly fewer weak passwords than normal, but again were
indistinguishable against ofﬂine attacks.
One other interesting categorization is the amount of data
that users have stored with Yahoo!. While this is a very
rough proxy for how active user accounts have been, there
is a clear trend that users with a large amount of stored data
choose better passwords.
C. Effects of dictionary speciﬁcity
While we have focused so far only on comparing the
shape of distributions, it is also interesting to compare their
content to examine the extent to which an inappropriate
cracking dictionary might slow down attackers (or skew
the conclusions of academic studies). To do this, we can
simulate a guessing attack on one distribution by guessing
passwords in the order they appear in another distribution,
instead of an optimal attack. We tested the top 1,000
passwords in each subpopulation, comparing ˆλ1000 for an
attack with the optimal dictionary to a sub-optimal one.
A simple example is to compare male and female-chosen
passwords:
dictionary
t ♀
e
g
r
a
t
♂
♀
7.8% 6.8%
♂ 6.3% 7.1%
There is a 10–15% loss in efﬁciency if an attacker uses the
optimal male dictionary against female-chosen passwords, or
vice-versa. This is small enough that we may conclude real-
world attackers are unlikely to tailor their guessing approach
based on the gender distribution of their target users. In
general, using an inappropriate dictionary has surprisingly
little impact on guessing efﬁciency, at least for an attacker
with a desired success rate α < 10%, which we tested to stay
in the well-approximated region given our data. In Table V
we compare the efﬁciency loss when using a password
dictionary from users of different languages, perhaps the
most inappropriate dictionaries possible. Surprisingly, the
worst efﬁciency loss observed is only a factor of 4.8, when
using an optimal Vietnamese-language password dictionary
against French speakers’ passwords.
We also observe in Table V that simply using the global
list of most popular passwords performs very well against

most subsets. The greatest efﬁciency loss for any subset
when using the global
is only 2.2, for Portuguese
language passwords. We can improve this slightly further
by constructing a special dictionary to be effective against
all subsets. We do this by repeatedly choosing the password
for which the lowest popularity in any subset is maximal and
call it the “minimax” dictionary, also seen in Table V. This
dictionary performs very similarly to the global dictionary,
reducing the maximum efﬁciency loss to a factor 2.1, also
for Portuguese language passwords.
