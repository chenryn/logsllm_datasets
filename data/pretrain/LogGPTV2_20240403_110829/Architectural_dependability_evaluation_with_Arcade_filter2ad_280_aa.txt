Abstract
This paper proposes a formally well-rooted and ex(cid:173)
tensible framework for dependability evaluation: Arcade
(architecturgJ d.ependability ~valuation).
It has been de(cid:173)
signed to combine the strengths ofprevious approaches to
the evaluation of dependability. A key feature is its for(cid:173)
mal semantics in terms ofInput/Output-Interactive Marlwv
Chains, which enables both compositional modeling and
compositional state space generation and reduction. The
latter enables great computational reductions for many
models. The Arcade approach is extensible, hence adapt(cid:173)
able to new circumstances or application areas. The paper
introduces the new modeling approach, discusses its formal
semantics and illustrates its use with two case studies.
1 Introduction
Now that computers and communication systems are
proliferating in all kinds of devices and home appliances,
high-dependability is no longer restricted to systems that are
being used in traditional safety- or mission-critical applica(cid:173)
tions, such as space and aircraft or (nuclear) power control
systems. An important difference with these traditional sys(cid:173)
tems, however, is that although high dependability is a key
concern, achieving it should be affordable in terms of costs.
Hence, high dependability must be achieved as a "by prod(cid:173)
uct" of a sound design and implementation trajectory, at al(cid:173)
most no additional costs. Therefore, dependability evalua(cid:173)
tion techniques are being integrated in design frameworks,
to enable a cost-efficient comparison of design alternatives
with respect to the dependability requirements.
Although the standard theory of reliability engineering
has been around for many years now [20], the actual use

of these methods during the design of computer and com(cid:173)
munication systems is far less common. Nevertheless,
a wide variety of modeling approaches has been devel(cid:173)
oped for evaluating system dependability. We categorize
them in three classes:
(1) General purpose models, such
as CTMCs, stochastic Petri nets (SPNs) [3] and their ex(cid:173)
tensions; stochastic process algebras (SPAs) [14, 15]; in(cid:173)
teractive Markov chains (IMCs) [13], Input/Output IMCs
(I/O-IMCs) [5], and stochastic activity networks (SAN) as
used in UltraSAN and Mobius [19]. These approaches are
general-purpose, serving the specification and validation of
a wide variety of quantitative properties of computer and
communication systems, and certainly not of dependabil(cid:173)
ity properties only.
(2) In contrast, several dependability(cid:173)
specific approaches have also been developed, such as relia(cid:173)
bility block diagrams (RBDs), the System Availability Esti(cid:173)
mator (SAVE) language [12], dynamic RBDs (DRBDs) [9];
dynamic fault trees (DFTs) [10] and extended fault trees
(eFTs) [7]; OpenSESAME [21], and TANGRAM [8]. (3)
Finally, for some architectural (design) languages specific
extensions have been developed to allow for dependability
analysis, most notably, the error annex of the architectural
description language AADL [2], and the UML dependabil(cid:173)
ity profile [1 7].
We have identified five criteria, a good dependability for(cid:173)
malism in our opinion should satisfy: (1) Modeling effort:
how easy is it to model a system and its dependability as(cid:173)
pects? (2) Expressiveness: what features (repair, spare man(cid:173)
agement, different failure modes, etc.) can be modeled and
can new ones easily be added? (3) Formal semantics:
is
the meaning of the models unambiguously clear? (4) Com(cid:173)
positionality: we distinguish between (4a) Compositional
modeling, meaning that a model can be created by compos(cid:173)
ing smaller submodels and (4b) Compositional state space
generation and reduction. Compositional state space gener(cid:173)
ation means that the state space of the entire model is con(cid:173)
structed out ofthe state spaces of its constituent subcompo(cid:173)
nents. Compositional state space reduction means that the
global state space of a multi-component system is obtained
by repeated composition and reduction (e.g., by bisimula-

automatic analysis?
(5) Tool support: are tools available for
The general-purpose formalisms,
specifying system
models in terms ofstates and transitions, have the advantage
of being very flexible (hence, expressive) and precise. But,
with these formalisms, it is often difficult to specify depend(cid:173)
ability models, since they do not provide any dependability(cid:173)
specific constructs, which in tum may lead to specifications
that are hard to understand and thus are potentially sub(cid:173)
ject to modelling errors. We also found that dependability
specific approaches score relatively low on expressiveness;
although each of them incorporates certain dependability
constructs, none of them includes them all. Although we
agree that it is impossible to include all possible features,
we do think that a modeling approach should be extensi(cid:173)
ble (cf. Section 3.6), so as to be able to accommodate any,
also future, needs. Architectural languages require limited
modeling effort, since they annotate architectural models
(which play an important role throughout the design). How(cid:173)
ever, these languages, as we know them, lack a formal and
compositional semantics and tool support for automatic de(cid:173)
pendability evaluation, although recently some work in this
direction has been done [18].
In this paper, we therefore propose a new, formally well(cid:173)
rooted and extensible framework for dependability evalua(cid:173)
tion that satisfies the five criteria we have discussed above:
Arcade (for architectur~l gependability ~valuation). In ad(cid:173)
dition, we define our framework in an architectural style,
i.e., we define a system model in terms of components or
entities that (directly) map to actual physical/logical sys(cid:173)
tem components. In fact, our framework is ultimately in(cid:173)
tended to be incorporated into an architectural design lan(cid:173)
guage. Arcade defines a system as a set of interacting com(cid:173)
ponents, where each component is provided with a set ofop(cid:173)
erational/failure modes, time-to-failure/repair distributions,
and failure/repair dependencies. Arcade models have a se(cid:173)
mantics in terms of 1/0-IMCs, thus pinning down their in(cid:173)
terpretation in an unambiguous way. Moreover, the compo(cid:173)
sitional state space generation and reduction technique for
I/O-IMCs also enables an efficient analysis of very large
Arcade models.
The paper is further structured as follows. In Section 2
we provide background on IMCs and 1/0-IMCs, the under(cid:173)
lying semantical models used in the remainder ofthis paper.
Section 3 introduces the Arcade modeling approach. Sec(cid:173)
tion 4 describes the currently employed tool-chain to evalu(cid:173)
ate Arcade models, whereas Section 5 reports on two cases
studies. Section 6 concludes the paper.

1/0-IMCs distinguish two types of transitions: (1) Int

M k v n tn t n labeled with rates A, indicating that
the transition can only be taken after a delay that is governed
by an exponential distribution with parameter A. Inspired by
I/O-automata, actions can be further partitioned into:

States are depicted by circles, initial states by an incoming

two Markovian transitions: one from 81 to 82 with rate A
and another from 83 to 84 with rate /1. The I/O-IMC has
one input action a? To ensure input-enabling, we specify
a?-self-Ioops in states 83, 84, and 85 1• Note that state 81

by an exponential distribution with parameter A, and moves
to state 82. If however, before that delay ends, an input a?
arrives, then the 1/0-IMC moves to 83. The only output
