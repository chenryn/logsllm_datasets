I have an enhancement request to shared_preferences plugin. On occasion the
native side of a Flutter app (e.g. Java side on Android) needs to access
shared preferences set in Flutter, or maybe set them for Flutter side as well.
It is necessary for example when communicating with other native apps on a
platform.
Currently what I have to do in Java to accomplish this is:
    SharedPreferences prefs = getSharedPreferences("FlutterSharedPreferences", MODE_PRIVATE);
and later when I want to read e.g. "myValue" key, I have to add "flutter."
prefix:
    String value = prefs.getString("flutter."+key, null);
This does not feel right though, spying on package private values and using
them elsewhere. A better way should be provided by the SharedPreferencesPlugin
instead.
