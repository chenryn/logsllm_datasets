User: Currently, I am doing a project about Nao Robot. I am having problem with importing the python class file into choregraphe. So anyone knows how to do this? 
Error message

[ERROR] behavior.box :init:8 _Behavior__lastUploadedChoregrapheBehaviorbehavior_127183361‌​6__root__RecordSound‌​_3__RecSoundFile_4: ALProxy::ALProxy Can't find service:
Assistant: You can add any path to the PYTHONPATH environment variable from within your behavior. However, this has bad side effects, like:

If you forget to remove the path from the environment right after importing your module, you won't know anymore where you are importing modules from, since there is only one Python context for the whole NAOqi and all the behaviors.
For the same reason (a single Python context), you'll need to restart NAOqi if you change the module you are trying to import.
