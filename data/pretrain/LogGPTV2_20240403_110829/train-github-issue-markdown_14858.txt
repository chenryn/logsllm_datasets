### Issue Report: Missing and Inconsistent Links in Scipy Tutorial Documentation

**Disclaimer:** I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to report this, but I hope it reaches the appropriate team.

**Description:**
The example code links in the Scipy tutorial documentation are missing or broken. Specifically, on the following page:
- [Interpolation (tutorial)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/interpolate.html)

When you click on "Source Code" for any of the examples, you are directed to a 404 error page. For example:
- [Broken Source Code Link](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/interpolate.html#source-code)

**Suggested Solutions:**
1. **Fix the Broken Links:** Ensure that all "Source Code" links point to the correct and existing example code.
2. **Enable Prompt Folding:** Implement prompt folding site-wide to improve the readability of the examples.
3. **Rename Links:** Change all "Source Code" links to "Example Code" to avoid confusion. "Source Code" should refer to the actual module code, not the example code.

**Additional Observations:**
- I reviewed other tutorial pages and found similar issues. Some pages have no links at all, while others lack prompt folding. There needs to be uniformity in the formatting across the documentation.
- All tutorial pages should either include "Example Code" links or none at all. Prompt folding should be enabled site-wide to enhance user experience.

**Potential Concerns:**
- Prompt folding may be an issue on some browsers or if JavaScript is restricted by security policies. In such cases, having functional example code links becomes even more critical.
