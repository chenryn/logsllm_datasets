Obligatory "not sure if this is the right place" disclaimer.
The example code links in the tutorial documentation are missing here:  
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/interpolate.html  
If you click Source Code:  
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/interpolate.html  
you get a 404 error  
Suggested solutions: Fix the links or enable prompt folding, or both.
Also suggest changing all "Source Code" links to "Example Code". Source code
should refer to the actual module code.
I looked at some other Tutorial pages, and they have similar issues. Some with
no links at all, most with no prompt folding. I think there needs to be
uniformity on the formatting. Either all with Source Code links, all without
links (not my favorite idea), prompt folding should be enabled site wide.
I wonder if prompt folding would be an issue on some browsers or if javascript
is restricted by security policies. In that case having example code links
