User: I have recently get hold of a RackSpace Ubuntu server and it has pythons all over the place: 
iPython in 3.5, Pandas in 3.4 &2.7, modules I need like pyodbc etc. are only in 2,7
Therefore, I am keen to clean up the box and, as a 2.7 users, keep everything in 2.7. 
So the key question is, is there a way to remove both 3.4 and 3.5 efficiently at the same time while keeping Python 2.7?
Assistant: Its simple
just try:
sudo apt-get remove python3.7 or the versions that you want to remove
