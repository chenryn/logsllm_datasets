User: I have downloaded a python program from git.
This program is python 3. 
On my laptop i have both python 2.7 and python 3.4. Python 2.7 is default version.
when i want run this program in terminal it gives some module errors because of it used the wrong version.
how can i force an name.py file to open in an (non) default version of python.
I have tried so search on google but this without any result because of lack of search tags.
also just trying things like ./name.py python3 but with same result(error)
Assistant: The Method of @Tom Dalton and @n1c9 work for me!
python3 name.py
