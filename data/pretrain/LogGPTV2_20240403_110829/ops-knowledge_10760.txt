To effectively implement CIS Control 16.9, which focuses on training developers in application security concepts and secure coding, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Comprehensive Training Programs:**
   - Ensure that all software development personnel receive regular and comprehensive training in writing secure code. This training should be tailored to their specific development environment and responsibilities.
   - The training should cover both general security principles and best practices for application security.

2. **Regular Training Sessions:**
   - Conduct training sessions at least annually to keep developers up-to-date with the latest security threats and mitigation techniques.
   - Consider additional, more frequent training (e.g., quarterly or bi-annually) to reinforce key concepts and address new vulnerabilities as they emerge.

3. **Interactive and Engaging Content:**
   - Design the training programs to be interactive and engaging, using a variety of methods such as hands-on exercises, case studies, and real-world examples.
   - Encourage active participation and discussion to ensure that developers fully understand and can apply the concepts.

4. **Promote a Security Culture:**
   - Foster a culture of security within the development team by integrating security into the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
   - Encourage developers to think about security from the beginning of a project and to consider it at every stage of development, testing, and deployment.

5. **Monitor and Evaluate:**
   - Regularly assess the effectiveness of the training programs through quizzes, assessments, and feedback from participants.
   - Use the results to continuously improve the training content and delivery methods.

6. **Integration with Other Controls:**
   - Ensure that the training aligns with other CIS controls and organizational security policies to create a cohesive and robust security framework.
   - Emphasize the importance of CIS Control 16.9, which is categorized under the asset type "Applications" and the security function "Protect."

By following these procedures, organizations can significantly enhance the security awareness and capabilities of their development teams, leading to more secure and resilient applications.
