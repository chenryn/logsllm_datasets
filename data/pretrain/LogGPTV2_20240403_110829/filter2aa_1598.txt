### Pen-Testing the Backbone

#### White Box vs. Black Box Testing
- **Black Box Testing**: Ideal for external reconnaissance and data gathering. However, it is more challenging and potentially destructive.
- **White Box Testing**: Preferred for backbone testing, as it minimizes the risk of causing service disruptions, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction.

#### Initial Reconnaissance
1. **Target Selection**: Identify the target's address blocks, autonomous systems, and other relevant data by searching registrars.
2. **Peering Analysis**: Use route servers and Internet maps to determine peering relationships.
3. **Profile Building**: Compile a comprehensive network profile using Google searches and mailing list archives for configuration details and public peering points.

#### Vendor-Specific Details
- Familiarize yourself with each vendor's advisory and vulnerability disclosure practices.
- Obtain necessary logins (e.g., CCO, Juniper) to access additional vulnerability information.
- Ensure that all network gear, including switches, is thoroughly reviewed.

#### Code Train Vulnerabilities
- Examine vulnerabilities specific to each code train in your network.
- Check for vulnerabilities in underlying stacks or implementations (e.g., BSD stack for Cisco IOS and JunOS).
- Utilize scanners for automated checks, but be cautious of potential DoS during scanning.

#### Failure Paths and Trust Relationships
- **Architectural Review**: Evaluate redundancy, robustness, and security.
- **Authentication Redundancy**: Assess fallback options and identify the weakest form of authentication.
- **Trust Transitivity**: Determine if trust is transitive and if source IP addresses are restricted.
- **Single Point of Failure**: Identify and mitigate single points of transit or authentication failure.

#### Centralized Authentication
- **Server Hardening**: Ensure that multiple, hardened authentication servers are in place.
- **Cleartext Credentials**: Verify that authentication credentials are not sent in cleartext.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to the authentication server and ensure it is whitelisted in ACLs.
- **MitM Attacks**: Prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks against the authentication server.

#### Physical Security
- **Data Centers and Peering Points**: Ensure robust physical security measures.
- **Regular Testing**: Conduct frequent and thorough physical security tests.
- **Local Access**: Prevent local injection or access to critical infrastructure.

#### Data Leaks
- **Network Border Monitoring**: Use sniffers to detect data leaks at network borders, especially at exchange points with promiscuous mode ports.
- **Sensitive Information**: Monitor for Cisco Discovery Protocol, routing protocol information, and leaked switching data.

#### Protocol Injection
- **Data Spoofing**: If you can see the data, you can spoof it.
- **Routing Announcements**: Inject fake routing announcements to test their acceptance.
- **DoS Attacks**: Be cautious with cheap DoS methods, as they are often undesirable.
- **Unauthenticated Protocols**: Many routing protocols lack authentication, making them vulnerable.

#### Rogue Router
- **Easy Access**: Connecting a new router to many data centers is surprisingly simple.
- **Routing Configuration**: Mimic the target's routing protocols to inject false data.
- **Client Agreements**: Depending on the contract, you may even replace the client's router with one of your own.

#### Pwn3d Router
- **Credential Acquisition**: With valid authentication credentials, router hijacking becomes possible.
- **Traffic Redirection**: Redirect traffic through tunnels of your choice.
- **Unauthorized Netblock Announcements**: Advertise unauthorized netblocks to affect overall network routing.

#### Netblock Hijack
- **Unauthorized Announcements**: Announce and route others' netblocks without authorization.
- **Real-World Example**: Spammers have stolen large netblocks, causing significant disruptions and blacklisting for the original owners.

#### Configuration Review
- **Secure Templates**: Compare your client's configurations against secure templates:
  - **BGP Template**: [Secure BGP Template](http://www.cymru.com/Documents/secure-bgp-template.html)
  - **IOS Template**: [Secure IOS Template](http://www.cymru.com/Documents/secure-ios-template.html)
  - **JunOS Template**: [Secure JunOS Template](http://www.cymru.com/gillsr/documents/junos-template.pdf)
  - **JunOS BGP Template**: [Secure JunOS BGP Template](http://www.cymru.com/gillsr/documents/junos-bgp-template.pdf)

#### Peering Security
- **Configuration Audit**: Review the peering configuration of the target network.
- **Route Server Data**: Ensure that data advertised from route servers is secure.
- **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication for peering changes.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Secure machines used for network policy enforcement.
