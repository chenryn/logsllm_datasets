User: Hey, I got a ReconnectingClientFactory and I wonder if I can somehow define protocol-instance-based connectionMade/connectionLost callbacks so that i can use the factory to connect to different hosts ans distinguish between each connection.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: No. Write a class that does the interaction with one user. In connectionMade you check if a instance of this class already exists, if not you make a new one and store it on the factory, ie in a { addr : handler } dict. If the connection exists alreay you get the old handler from the factory.
