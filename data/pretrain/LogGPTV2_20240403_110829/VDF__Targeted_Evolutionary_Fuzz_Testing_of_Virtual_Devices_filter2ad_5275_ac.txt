### 4. Evaluation

#### 4.1. Configuration
All evaluations were conducted on cloud-based instances, each equipped with an 8-core 2.0 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2650 CPU and 8 GB of RAM. Each instance ran a minimal server installation of Ubuntu 14.04 Linux as the operating system. A total of eight cloud instances were used in parallel. For each device, one master fuzzer process and five slave fuzzer processes were employed for testing. The same configuration was used for test case minimization, with each cloud instance running six minimizer processes in parallel to reduce crash and hang test cases.

#### 4.2. Virtual Devices
We selected a set of eighteen virtual devices for our evaluation of VDF, as shown in Table 2. These devices cover a wide range of hardware features, including timers, interrupts, and DMA. Each device provides one or more MMIO interfaces to their control registers, which VDF's fuzzing accelerator interacts with. All devices were evaluated using QEMU v2.5.05, except for the TPM device, which was evaluated using QEMU v2.2.50 with an applied patchset that provides libtpms emulation [20]. The versions of QEMU identified for this study were selected at the start of the US government approval process, which took approximately one year.

#### 4.3. Implementation
Fewer than 1000 lines of code were added to the QEMU codebase to implement both the fuzzer accelerator and any necessary recording instrumentation within each tested virtual device.

#### 4.4. Bug Discovery
VDF discovered significant bugs in six of the virtual devices, including a known denial-of-service CVE [7] and a new, previously undiscovered denial-of-service CVE [8]. Additional bugs related to memory management and thread-race conditions were also found, demonstrating VDF's capability to identify a variety of issues using the same techniques and principles.

#### 4.5. Metrics and Analysis
During our testing with VDF, we collected four key metrics to assess the speed and extent of coverage:
1. Number of branches covered by the initial seed test case.
2. Total number of branches in the virtual device.
3. Current total number of branches covered (updated every minute).
4. Percentage of total bugs discovered during each cumulative day of testing.

These metrics provide insight into the total coverage provided by VDF, the rate at which coverage improves through fuzzing, and the speed at which crashes and hangs are discovered.

**Figure 6: Average Percentage of Covered Branches Over Cumulative Testing Time**

- **Initial Coverage**: 30.15% of the total branches were covered by the initial seed test cases.
- **After Nine Cumulative Days**: 62.32% of the total branches were covered.
- **First Six Hours**: The largest increase in average coverage, from 30.15% to 52.84%.
- **After 2.25 Days**: The rate of coverage improvement slowed, with only 0.43% more branches discovered over the next 6.75 days.
- **Device-Specific Performance**: Eleven out of eighteen devices stopped discovering new branches after one day, while six continued to discover additional branches until 6.5 cumulative days. Only the serial device discovered additional branches after nine cumulative days.
