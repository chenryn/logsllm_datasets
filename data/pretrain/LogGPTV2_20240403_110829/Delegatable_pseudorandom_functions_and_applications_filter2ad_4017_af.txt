### Summary of DPRFs in Authentication and Access Control

DPRFs (Delegatable Pseudorandom Functions) find excellent applications in authentication and access control within RFID systems. They enable efficient tag key delegation from the Tag Controller (TC) to the reader, optimizing bandwidth usage. Additionally, policy-private DPRFs provide enhanced protection for tag IDs against potential eavesdropping by readers.

### Batch Queries in Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)

**Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)**, as described in [11, 24], allows for direct processing of queries on ciphertexts generated using symmetric encryption. While SSE is a general paradigm, it primarily supports keyword queries. We focus on the definitions and schemes in [11] that offer a provably secure level of protection.

#### General Framework
1. **Offline Stage**: 
   - The client encrypts their data with a secret key \( k \).
   - The encrypted data \( c \) is uploaded to an untrusted server.
   - A secure index \( I \), essentially an encrypted lookup table or inverted index, is created and sent to the server for efficient keyword search.

2. **Query Generation**:
   - For a keyword \( w \), the client generates a query token \( \tau_w \) using \( k \) and sends it to the server.
   - The token \( \tau_w \) is a PRF value computed on \( w \) with \( k \).

3. **Server Processing**:
   - The server uses \( \tau_w \) to search the index \( I \) and retrieves the IDs of the ciphertexts associated with \( w \).
   - The results \( c_1, \ldots, c_m \) are transmitted back to the client for decryption.

#### Security Goal
- Protect both the data and the keyword from the server.

### Batch Keyword Queries in SSE

Suppose the client wants to search for a batch of \( N \) keywords \( w_1, \ldots, w_N \). For example, the client may need documents containing multiple specific keywords. Another scenario involves employee records where each record has a salary attribute in intervals like \([iK, (i+1)K]\). To retrieve records within a range, such as \([1K, 10K]\), the client can issue 9 distinct queries for each interval, e.g., \([1K, 2K]\), \([2K, 3K]\), ..., \([9K, 10K]\).

**Traditional SSE**:
- The client generates \( N \) trapdoors \( \tau_{w_1}, \ldots, \tau_{w_N} \) and sends them to the server.
- The server searches the index \( I \) with each \( \tau_{w_i} \).

**Enhanced SSE with DPRFs**:
- Instead of computing a PRF value for each \( w_i \), the client delegates this computation to the server using a DPRF scheme \((F, T, C)\).
- Given a predicate \( P \) and key \( k \), the client runs \( T \) to generate a single trapdoor \( \tau \) and sends it to the server.
- The server executes \( C \) on \( \tau \) to produce \( \tau_{w_1}, \ldots, \tau_{w_N} \).

For range queries, if URC (a type of DPRF) is used, the computational and communication cost at the client decreases from \( O(N) \) to \( O(\log N) \). This transformation works seamlessly with any SSE scheme that uses a PRF for creating tokens.

### Security and Privacy

The enhanced framework can be proven secure against adaptive adversaries, similar to [11]. The security game and proof must account for the information leakage of the \( C \) algorithm in the DPRF. The level of keyword privacy provided by the construction depends on the policy privacy of the underlying DPRF. Multi-instance policy privacy ensures the same level of keyword privacy as [11], while weaker policy privacy (e.g., single-instance or union) results in correspondingly weaker keyword privacy.

### Broadcast Encryption

In broadcast encryption, a sender transmits data to a set of receivers, excluding certain users on the fly. The sender makes an initial key assignment and then uses the key material to ensure only the chosen set of users can decrypt the message.

**Key Assignment**:
- The key assignment step can be seen as a PRF over the set \( \Phi \) of all distinct subsets assigned distinct keys.
- Each user \( u \) stores the keys corresponding to subsets \( S \in \Phi \) where \( u \in S \).

**DPRF in Broadcast Encryption**:
- Any DPRF can serve as a key assignment mechanism, saving space on receiver storage.
- For example, our range-based DPRF constructions can be used to efficiently enable any range of receivers within a distance \( t \) from a fixed location \( v \) with a single ciphertext.

### Conclusion

We introduced delegatable pseudorandom functions (DPRFs), a new cryptographic primitive allowing policy-based computation of PRF values by an untrusted proxy without knowledge of the secret or input values. We provided formal definitions for correctness, security, and policy privacy, and presented two DPRF constructions for range-based policies. Our DPRFs have practical applications in key-delegation and key-derivation settings, offering new and interesting results.

Further research directions include designing DPRFs for other predicates, establishing bounds on efficiency and policy privacy, and exploring applications in other settings.
