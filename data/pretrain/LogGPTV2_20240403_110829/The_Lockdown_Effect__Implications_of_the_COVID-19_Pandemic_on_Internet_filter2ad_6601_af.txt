A TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION
To the best of our knowledge, there is no established and compre-
hensive classification of flow data into traffic classes. Even if such
a classification existed, it would be a constantly moving target and
highly dependent on the vantage point. Thus, we have compiled
classifications based on scientific-related work such as [6, 60], prod-
uct and service documentations [15, 28, 44, 45], and public databases
[47, 51] for the different vantage points. These classifications have
the largest possible overlap, but may differ between vantage points
for one or more of the following reasons.
Local differences. We are investigating vantage points from a
total of three countries on two continents. There exist local content
providers and ISPs in each country that play a dominant role in their
respective home market (e.g., digital offers of local broadcasting
networks, national ISPs). Likewise, for IXPs, not every network is
present at every IXP, which makes defining a common classification
across different IXPs difficult.
Different types of Networks. We investigate different types of
networks attracting different traffic mixes. For instance, cloud gam-
ing does not play a major role in academic networks (see Section 7),
and Video on Demand is usually not consumed via mobile providers.
Consequently, different traffic classes are relevant for different net-
works leading to a different classification.
Ease of Classification. Not all traffic classes can be classified
easily and they are not mutually exclusive. An example is the VPN
classification in section 6 requiring the additional use of DNS infor-
mation. Moreover, the number and size of the datasets used in this
work is exceptional, so certain classifications cannot be performed
on all data in reasonable time.

Table 3: Overview of filters for the EDU traffic application
classification analysis (Section 7). We note that these cate-
gories are not mutually exclusive (e.g., QUIC is a subset of
Web) to enable the analysis of different phenomena.
Notably, the goal of the classifications defined in this work is
not to catch all traffic for a certain traffic class, but rather a repre-
sentative subset of traffic allowing to reason about trends during
the pandemic. In the following we disclose as many details of the
classifications used in this work as possible. However, due to the
sensitive nature of flow data, some of the information is covered
by non-disclosure agreements and can therefore not be published.
A.1 Hypergiants Classification
A classification of hypergiant ASes is provided by Böttger et al. [6].
As this classification is established in the scientific community, we
leverage it in this work. For more details on this classification and
how the 15 ASes are selected, see [6]. Table 2 reports the full list of
ASes considered for this category. Nevertheless, the classification
is limited to a few very large networks and cannot provide insights
beyond these hypergiants.
A.2 Application Classification Academic
Network
For the academic network, we focus on applications we expect to be
used by academic staff and students, e.g., VPN, SSH, remote desktop
applications and entertainment (e.g., Spotify), see Table 3.

or separately. Used to classify data in Figures 9, 10.

utilization at IXP-CE, February week vs. April week.
Figure 15: ECDF of minimum, average and maximum link
utilization at IXP-CE, February week to June week.
A.3 Application Classification ISP/IXPs
As ISP and IXP networks have a comparable traffic mix, we compiled
a joint classification for the ISP/IXP vantage points allowing for a
high comparability. The classification is based on combinations of
ASes (at IXPs by port, at ISP by IP ranges) and transport protocol
ports if characteristic protocols exist. While the transport protocols
are disclosed in Table 4, the measured ASes cannot be disclosed
due to non-disclosure agreements.
B ADDITIONAL PLOTS FOR LINK
UTILIZATION
The hereby presented plots serve as an addition to statements made
in Section 3.3. Figures 14 and 15 show the relative link utilization at
IXP-CE for weeks in April and June, respectively. We also plot the
link utilization from the reference week in February for comparison.
These plots show, in contrast to Figure 5, an increased overall link
utilization at IXP-CE.
C ADDITIONAL PLOTS FOR APPLICATIONS
BY PORT CLASSIFICATION
In the following we present additional plots for the applications by
port classification.
Figures 16 and 17 show the differences by top application ports
compared directly with the base week of February, for the IXP-
CE and ISP-CE respectively. This is different from Figures 7 and
8 shown in Section 4 which show the difference for weeks of two
consecutive month, i.e., emphasizing on the differences between
the selected weeks. On the other hand, Figures 16 and 17 emphasize
the result of the lockdown and its lifting compared to the regular
February 2020 week, i.e., what changes do we observe in each month
compared to the base week.
All previously shown figures focusing on the applications by
port classification, are limited to the changes for workdays within
the selected weeks. To complement the changes seen on workdays,
Figures 18 and 19 show the traffic changes based on application
port and hour of weekend days only.
