## Traffic Classification

To the best of our knowledge, there is no established and comprehensive classification of flow data into traffic classes. Even if such a classification existed, it would be a constantly moving target and highly dependent on the vantage point. Therefore, we have compiled classifications based on scientific work [6, 60], product and service documentations [15, 28, 44, 45], and public databases [47, 51] for different vantage points. These classifications aim to have the largest possible overlap but may differ between vantage points for the following reasons:

1. **Local Differences:** We investigate vantage points from three countries on two continents. Local content providers and ISPs play dominant roles in their respective home markets. For example, local broadcasting networks and national ISPs are significant. Similarly, not every network is present at every Internet Exchange Point (IXP), making a common classification across different IXPs challenging.

2. **Different Types of Networks:** We examine different types of networks that attract different traffic mixes. For instance, cloud gaming is not a major component of academic networks, and Video on Demand (VoD) is typically not consumed via mobile providers. Consequently, different traffic classes are relevant for different networks, leading to varying classifications.

3. **Ease of Classification:** Not all traffic classes can be classified easily, and they are not mutually exclusive. For example, classifying Virtual Private Network (VPN) traffic requires additional DNS information. Additionally, the size and number of datasets used in this work are exceptional, making certain classifications impractical to perform on all data in a reasonable time.

### Hypergiant ASes Classification
A classification of hypergiant Autonomous Systems (ASes) is provided by BÃ¶ttger et al. [6]. This classification is well-established in the scientific community, and we leverage it in this work. Table 2 lists the full set of ASes considered for this category. However, this classification is limited to a few very large networks and cannot provide insights beyond these hypergiants.

| Org. Name | ASN |
|-----------|-----|
| Apple Inc | 714 |
| Amazon.com | 16509 |
| Facebook | 32934 |
| Google Inc. | 15169 |
| Akamai Technologies | 20940 |
| Yahoo! | 10310 |
| Netflix | 2906 |
| OVH | 6939 |
| Hurricane Electric | 16276 |
| Limelight Networks Global | 22822 |
| Microsoft | 8075 |
| Twitter, Inc. | 13414 |
| Twitch | 46489 |
| Cloudflare | 13335 |
| Verizon Digital Media Services | 15133 |

### Application Classification for Academic Networks
For academic networks, we focus on applications used by academic staff and students, such as VPN, SSH, remote desktop applications, and entertainment (e.g., Spotify). Table 3 provides an overview of the filters used for this classification.

| Application Class | Filter |
|-------------------|--------|
| Web | TCP:80, TCP:443, UDP:443 (QUIC), TCP:8000, TCP:8080 |
| QUIC | UDP:443 |
| Push notifications | TCP:5223, TCP:5228 |
| Email | TCP:25, TCP:110, TCP:143, TCP:465, TCP:587, TCP:993, TCP:995 |
| VPN | UDP:500, ESP, GRE, TCP:1194, UDP:1194, UDP:4500 (Fortigate) |
| SSH | TCP:22 |
| Remote Desktop | TCP:1494 and UDP:1494 (Citrix remote desktop), TCP:3389 (Windows remote desktop), TCP:5938, UDP:5938 (Team Viewer) |
| Spotify | TCP:4070 or ASN8403 |

### Application Classification for ISP/IXPs
ISP and IXP networks have a comparable traffic mix, so we compiled a joint classification for these vantage points. The classification is based on combinations of ASes (at IXPs by port, at ISP by IP ranges) and transport protocol ports if characteristic protocols exist. While the transport protocols are disclosed in Table 4, the measured ASes cannot be disclosed due to non-disclosure agreements.

| Application Class | Notes |
|-------------------|-------|
| Web conferencing and telephony (Web conf) | 6 Conferencing audio/video ports, AS-based for pure conferencing provider (TCP:444, UDP:3478-3481, UDP:8200, UDP:5005, UDP:1089, UDP:10000) |
| Video on Demand (VoD) | Large to medium VoD provider ASes |
| Gaming | 57 Transport ports of popular games, AS-based for large gaming providers (e.g., TCP:1716, TCP:4001, TCP:3074, ...), includes cloud gaming services |
| Social media | Social networks including their respective CDNs (HTTPs+respective AS) |
| Email | 10 Typical mail transport ports (TCP:25, TCP:587, TCP:109, TCP:110, TCP:143, TCP:220, TCP:645, TCP:585, TCP:993, TCP:995) |
| Educational | ASes of universities close to respective vantage points |
| Collaborative working | 9 Collaborative editing, file sharing, versioning, VPN, remote administration (e.g., TCP:1194, UDP:1194, UDP:1197, UDP:1198, ...) |
| Content Delivery Network (CDN) | Dominant CDN providers (excluding social network CDNs) by AS |

### Additional Plots for Link Utilization
The plots presented here serve as an addition to statements made in Section 3.3. Figures 14 and 15 show the relative link utilization at IXP-CE for weeks in April and June, respectively, compared to the reference week in February. These plots demonstrate an increased overall link utilization at IXP-CE, contrasting with Figure 5.

### Additional Plots for Applications by Port Classification
Figures 16 and 17 show the differences by top application ports compared directly with the base week of February for IXP-CE and ISP-CE, respectively. These figures emphasize the changes observed during the lockdown and its lifting compared to the regular February 2020 week.

Figures 18 and 19 show the traffic changes based on application port and hour of weekend days only, complementing the changes seen on workdays.
