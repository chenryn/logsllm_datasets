I am experiencing an issue with Firefox (version 19.0.2, Windows 7 64-bit) where clicking a link with the mouse wheel to open it in a new background tab does not work. This function works correctly in Chrome. I suspect that the problem may be related to bootstrap.js.

To reproduce the issue:
1. Visit the following example page: <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>
2. Attempt to click on a link using the mouse wheel.

Could you please help me identify and resolve this issue?
