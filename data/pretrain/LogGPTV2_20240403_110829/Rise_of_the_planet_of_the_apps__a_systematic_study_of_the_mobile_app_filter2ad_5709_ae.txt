### Chapter 3: The Rise

#### 3.1 Marketplace Growth Rates

Table 3.3 presents the mean download growth rates for various marketplaces over different time periods. The table includes the total, monthly, and daily growth rates for SlideMe, 1Mobile, AppChina, and Anzhi.

| Marketplace | Total Mean Downloads' Growth Rate | Monthly Mean Downloads' Growth Rate | Daily Mean Downloads' Growth Rate |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| SlideMe     | 17.4% (154 days)                  | 3.4%                                | 0.1%                               |
| 1Mobile     | 65.9% (78 days)                   | 16.9%                               | 0.5%                               |
| AppChina    | 48.3% (62 days)                   | 23.4%                               | 0.7%                               |
| Anzhi       | 89.4% (61 days)                   | 43.9%                               | 1.4%                               |

**Table 3.3: Mean Downloads Growth Rate**

The data in Table 3.3 indicate that the monthly growth rate of mean downloads for AppChina and Anzhi is higher than that for SlideMe and 1Mobile. This suggests that Chinese marketplaces can offer app developers a faster increase in app popularity. Notably, Anzhi has the highest monthly growth rate at 44%, which aligns with the observations from Trilena Games, who reported a significant rise in their app downloads on Anzhi within a few days.

#### 3.2 Growth Distribution Among Different Apps

While Figure 3.2 shows a linear increase in the total number of downloads over time, it is important to understand how this growth is distributed among different apps. Are there specific applications that experience rapid growth, or are there apps that receive no downloads at all?

Figure 3.4 plots the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the growth rate of different apps in the four appstores over a two-month period. The growth rate of an app is defined as the ratio of the number of times the app was downloaded within the measurement interval to the number of downloads at the beginning of the interval. For example, if an app had 100 downloads at the start and 130 downloads at the end, its growth rate would be (130-100)/100 = 30%.

**Figure 3.4: CDF of Growth Rate of Apps**

- **AppChina and Anzhi:**
  - Median app growth rate: 27% and 30%, respectively.
  - Upper 10% of apps: Growth rate > 80%.
  - Upper 5% of apps: Growth rate > 130% for AppChina and > 250% for Anzhi.
  - All apps in these marketplaces had a positive growth rate, indicating at least one download.

- **SlideMe and 1Mobile:**
  - Median app growth rate: 18% for SlideMe and 7.5% for 1Mobile.
  - Upper 10% of apps: Growth rate > 47% for SlideMe and > 220% for 1Mobile.
  - A significant percentage of apps (23% for SlideMe and 31% for 1Mobile) received no downloads during the measurement interval.

These findings suggest that Chinese marketplaces are more favorable for app developers, as they ensure a higher likelihood of app downloads. Additionally, the placement strategy in AppChina, where popular and less popular apps are displayed together, appears to boost the visibility and downloads of less popular apps.

#### 3.3 The "Forgotten" Apps

Figure 3.4 highlights that a large percentage of apps in SlideMe and 1Mobile did not receive any downloads during the measurement interval. It is interesting to explore the size of this set of "forgotten" apps and how it changes with the length of the measurement interval.

**Figure 3.5: Percentage of Apps with Zero Downloads Over Time**

- **Chinese Marketplaces (AppChina and Anzhi):**
  - The percentage of apps with zero downloads drops quickly and remains at 0% after 5-10 days.

- **SlideMe:**
  - The percentage of "forgotten" apps reaches a plateau of 24.5% in the first 60 days and decreases to 21% by the end of the 154-day measurement interval.

- **1Mobile:**
  - The plateau is around 26%.

Further analysis revealed that the "forgotten" apps in 1Mobile are mostly very old (more than one year old), while in SlideMe, they are a mix of old and paid apps.

#### 3.4 Summary

This chapter explored the growth of available applications in monitored appstores and the distribution of app downloads over time. Key findings include:

- High monthly growth rates ranging from 1% (Anzhi) to 36% (AppChina).
- Chinese marketplaces (AppChina and Anzhi) exhibit significantly higher growth rates, making them more attractive for developers seeking rapid app popularity.
- All apps in Chinese marketplaces had positive growth rates, while a significant proportion of apps in SlideMe and 1Mobile received no downloads.
- The "forgotten" apps in 1Mobile were primarily very old, and in SlideMe, they were a mix of old and paid apps.
- Chinese marketplaces employ a strategy of placing unpopular apps alongside popular ones, enhancing the visibility and downloads of the former.

### Chapter 4: App Popularity

#### 4.1 Pareto Effect

Previous studies have shown that web content and file downloads often follow the "Pareto Principle," where 20% of the documents account for 80% of the downloads. Figure 4.1 illustrates the CDF of the percentage of app downloads as a function of app ranking for the different appstores.

**Figure 4.1: CDF of App Downloads by Rank**

- **AppChina and Anzhi:**
  - Approximately 10% of the apps account for close to 90% of all downloads.

- **1Mobile:**
  - 10% of the apps account for more than 85% of the downloads.

- **SlideMe:**
  - 10% of the apps account for more than 70% of the downloads.

**Figure 4.2: Zoomed CDF of App Downloads by Rank**

- **AppChina:**
  - 1% of the apps account for more than 60% of the downloads.

- **Anzhi:**
  - 1% of the apps account for more than 70% of the downloads.

- **1Mobile:**
  - 1% of the apps account for more than 55% of the downloads.

- **SlideMe:**
  - 1% of the apps account for more than 30% of the downloads.

#### 4.2 Power-Law Behavior

While it is clear that app downloads follow the Pareto principle, we further investigate whether they also follow a power-law distribution, similar to web downloads.

**Figure 4.3: Cumulative Distribution of Total Downloads per App**

- **AppChina, SlideMe, 1Mobile, and Anzhi:**
  - The CDF shows a linear slope, indicating a Zipf distribution, truncated at both ends (for small and large x values).

**Figure 4.4: Total Downloads per App by Rank**

- **AppChina and Anzhi:**
  - The number of downloads for very popular apps (small x values) is almost horizontal, suggesting the "fetch-at-most-once" principle, where users typically download each app only once unless it is updated.

- **SlideMe and 1Mobile:**
  - Similar patterns, but with fewer updates.

**Figure 4.5: CDF of the Number of Updates per App**

- **AppChina:**
  - 34% of the apps were updated.

- **SlideMe and 1Mobile:**
  - 20% of the apps were updated.

- **Anzhi:**
  - 15% of the apps were updated.

The "fetch-at-most-once" property is a general characteristic of marketplaces, limiting the number of times a user will download the same app, as apps do not change frequently.

#### 4.3 Effect of User Ratings

We explore how user ratings affect app popularity. SlideMe, 1Mobile, and Anzhi provided information about user ratings and the number of votes during our measurement period.

**Figure 4.6: Relationship Between User Ratings and App Downloads**

- **Analysis:**
  - We calculated the average app downloads for different vote bins to examine the relationship between user ratings and app popularity.
