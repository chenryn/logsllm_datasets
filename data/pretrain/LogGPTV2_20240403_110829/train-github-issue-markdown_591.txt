## Feature request
**What is the expected behavior?**  
If you do "webpack --watch" it's currently only detecting and recompiling when
existing files are changed.
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**  
I want to be able to drop new jsx files into the source directory tree, and
have them automatically be compiled into the output tree.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**  
Every directory and subdirectory would have to be watched for new files (in
addition to current behavior). The new feature doesn't necessarily need to
support files in new directories that are created after webpack is launched,
if that's harder (it probably is).
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**  
yes
