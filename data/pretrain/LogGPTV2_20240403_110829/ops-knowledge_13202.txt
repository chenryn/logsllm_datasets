User: Please explain what is a container (Container) and what is the difference between it and a virtual machine? And introduce the basic concepts and usage of Docker.
Assistant: Container (Container) is a lightweight virtualization technology that can create an independent, runnable software application and all its dependencies, isolated from other containers, but sharing the same operating system kernel. Containers can be quickly and easily deployed, moved, and copied, and have the advantages of high efficiency, portability, scalability, and manageability. Compared with the traditional virtual machine technology, the container uses the operating system kernel of the host machine instead of installing an operating system for each virtual machine, so it has higher advantages in resource utilization, startup speed and operating performance. Docker is an open source container technology platform that provides a series of tools and services that can package an application and all its dependencies into an image (Image), and publish the image to a warehouse such as Docker Hub, and then use the image to create and run the container. The basic concepts of Docker include the following aspects: 1. Image: An image is a read-only template that contains the necessary files and dependencies for creating a container. You can define the image building process through Dockerfile, or obtain ready-made images through warehouses such as Docker Hub. 2. Container: A container is a runnable instance started by an image, which can create, start, stop, and delete a container, and can directly interact with the container. 3. Repository: Repository is a place to store and manage images, which can be divided into public warehouses and private warehouses. The basic process of using Docker is as follows: 1. Define the Dockerfile file and build the image; 2. Publish the image to Docker Hub or other warehouses through the Docker command; 3. Pull the image on the target machine, create and run the container. Docker has a wealth of command line operations, and you can control various operations of Docker through the command line. For example: - docker build: build a new image based on Dockerfile; - docker run: create and run a container; - docker stop: stop a container; - docker ps: list all currently running containers; - docker image: list all local mirror; - docker push: publish the local mirror to the warehouse.
