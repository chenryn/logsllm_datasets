outcome.
Another concern is when some forms of hidden public information are collected 
and publicized widely as part of a scandal. As you are going to see in this book, a lot of 
public information cannot be viewed by the regular Internet user and needs specific 
techniques/methods to acquire. What is the consequence for such things? What will be 
the effects on some groups or individuals when revealing such information about them? 
What are the moral consequences?
Over the past five years, many whistleblowers have stolen classified information from 
well-guarded agencies and institutions and published it online (Edward Snowden is a 
clear example). Should we consider this information belonging to the public source? Of 
course, military departments around the world will be thirsty for such information, but 
should we use it—as individuals or companies—as a public source for our intelligence?

Many corporations (Facebook and Google are examples) harvest a large volume 
of online user data for commercial intelligence; most of this data belongs to the user’s 
actions and behavior online and cannot be used to recognize the user’s real identity. For 
instance, there are two types of data that can be collected online:
• 
Sensitive personal information (SPI) such as name, Social Security 
number, place of birth, parents’ names, passport or ID number
• 
Anonymous information such as technical information like your 
OS type and version, browser version, IP address, connected device 
location, and anything that is shared between more than one 
connected user
To justify the collection, these corporations say they acquire only anonymous data, 
but what if this anonymous information has been combined with other sources to 
become SPI? How should such information be handled by the OSINT analyst?
The final legal concern that we are going to cover is the reliance on automated 
machines to collect and analyze OSINT information. Can we trust the outcome of 
automated machines and treat it just like the data collected by humans? What if there 
is a software flaw in the tool that produces inaccurate output that leads to harmful 
consequences? How we can find a balance between using automated machines, which 
are necessary in the OSINT-gathering process, and remaining ethical?
The limitations of OSINT in addition to its legal constraints should encourage its 
adopters to follow an individualized and tailored approach when using it.
 Summary
In this chapter, you discovered the essence of OSINT, its types and users, and how it can 
be used in different contexts by different parties to gain intelligence. We distinguished 
between different ways to gather information online (mainly technical footprinting) and 
talked briefly about what things each method cares about.
We concluded by talking about the advantages and limitations of OSINT gathering. 
No information-gathering methodology is considered 100 percent complete; however, 
with the right planning and sufficient resources and expertise, exploiting OSINT will 
produce accurate results on a great scale.

OSINT is a great place to get intelligence about future events, but acquiring OSINT 
alone is not enough to produce accurate results. For instance, to achieve the best results 
from OSINT sources, some value-added tasks must be considered during the analysis 
phase, such as using an expert analyst, merging OSINT information with classified 
information when handling military information, and adopting the right techniques to 
acquire nonbiased OSINT intelligence.
This chapter was an introduction to the subject. In the following chapters, we will 
thoroughly cover a plethora of techniques and tools to harvest and analyze OSINT 
information. Before we begin diving into the world of OSINT, though, it is essential 
to learn how to maintain our digital privacy and obscure our online activities when 
conducting OSINT gathering, and this will be the subject of the next chapter.

CHAPTER 2
Introduction To 
Online Threats and 
Countermeasures
As you do your research for OSINT, you will certainly leave digital traces behind that 
can be used to track you. For example, consider an investigator performing an online 
search for drug dealers in Mexico. What if the people the investigator was searching for 
discovers his search? What if they could learn the source of the search (the organization 
or the person behind the search) and the searcher’s location? If you think that criminal 
organizations are not technically savvy, we’re afraid you are wrong. Terrorists and 
criminal organizations have specialized teams working in IT to gather intelligence 
online, and even small criminal organizations with limited budgets outsource such tasks 
to specialized organizations for a fee.
As you saw in Chapter 1, OSINT is beneficial to many user groups. We already gave 
an example for an investigator searching for drug dealers; however, the same thing 
applies to anyone conducting OSINT searches such as individuals, government entities, 
business corporations, and even NGOs and global organizations like NATO. Revealing 
the searcher’s identity when conducting OSINT searches can have dangerous—and even 
legal—consequences on some user segments.
In this chapter, we will teach you how to conceal your digital identity and become 
anonymous online. You will learn how to exchange data secretly across hostile 
environments like the Internet and how to communicate with your peers privately and 
anonymously. You will also learn how to check your digital footprint and discover what 
kind of digital traces you are leaving behind. But before we begin, we will cover online 
22
threats and how outside adversaries can exploit computing devices and networks to steal 
confidential information. Countermeasures and best practices to maintain your online 
security and privacy will be thoroughly covered.
This is the longest chapter in this book; you can consider it as a mini book that 
teaches you how to work online privately. This knowledge is mandatory, as you cannot 
conduct OSINT searches with your real identity.
Note! We cannot teach you how to become 100 percent anonymous in one 
chapter. However, to begin conducting your OSINT search, this chapter is enough to 
help you avoid attracting outside observers to your OSINT-gathering activities.
To understand all concepts in depth and learn how different actors can invade 
your privacy, you should read our book Digital Privacy and Security Using 
Windows (https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484227985), which is 
considered the perfect companion to this book. If you already have this book, you 
can skip this chapter.
 Online Threats
Despite its great benefits to humanity, the Internet is still a hostile environment. 
Bad guys are always out there to disrupt your life. In this section, we will list the 
main risks that Internet users face when going online, and we will give brief advice/
countermeasures for each one.
 Malware
Malware is short for “malicious software.” It is the term used for any malicious software/
code that can damage to your computing device or steal your confidential information 
without your consent. There are different kinds of malware such as viruses, spyware, 
rootkits, worms, ransomware, scareware, and adware.

Note! There are many websites that offer free samples of live malicious code 
(malware) for security researchers, incident responders, forensic analysts, and any 
interested party. Some of these sites are the following:
https://virusshare.com
https://www.virustotal.com
http://malc0de.com/database
https://virusscan.jotti.org
 Black Hat Hackers
Black hat hackers are people with sophisticated computing skills. They aim to invade 
private networks and break into other people computing devices to steal personal 
information or to conduct other malicious acts. They usually exploit vulnerabilities in 
the OS, in application programs, or in networking devices to gain unauthorized access. 
After gaining access, they may install a keylogger or a Trojan horse to maintain their 
access, steal information, or spy on user activities.
 Pharming
Pharming is a cyberattack intended to redirect users from a legitimate website to a 
fraudulent site without their knowledge. Pharming can be conducted either by changing 
the hosts file on a victim’s computer or by poisoning the Domain Name System (DNS) 
server records with false information to lead users to unwanted destinations.
Windows users can prevent this type of attack on their local machines by preventing 
hosts file modifications through the following steps:
 1. Navigate to the %SYSTEMDRIVE%\Windows\Ssystem32\drivers\etc 
folder (SYSTEMDRIVE is where you installed Windows, usually at 
C:\).
 2. Right-click the hosts file, select Properties, and select the Read-
only attribute; finally, click OK (see Figure 2-1).

Note! You can edit the Windows hosts file using a feature-rich tool. Such tools allow 
you to add entries to block malware sites and enable or disable the hosts file. Check 
out Hostsman (www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman) and Sysmate - Hosts File  
Walker (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sysmate-hosts- file-walker/).
 Phishing
Phishing is a kind of social engineering attack where an attacker uses psychological 
tricks (social tricks) over the phone or uses a computing device (emails, IM chat) to 
convince people to hand over sensitive information about themselves or an organization 
and its computer systems.
Phishing emails appear as if they were sent by a legitimate company or someone 
you know (such as an individual on your contact list). These emails usually contain a 
link that the user must click to access/update an online account (for example, a bank or 
social site account). Upon clicking such links, the user will be directed to a fraudulent 
website that appears legitimate. When the user provides their credentials, the attacker 
will store them for later use and direct the user to the original website.

attacks on Windows machines

Phishing emails have some characteristics that anyone can spot. Here is a list of the 
main ones:
• 
They use threatening or urgent words in the subject line to encourage 
the user to act promptly. They usually ask you to update your online 
account or to send your personal details by replying to the email.
• 
Some phishing emails offer prizes, work-from-home vacancies 
with large salaries and no qualifications necessary, or business 
investments with high profits. Then they ask for your contact details 
for further negotiations.
• 
Phishing emails look unprofessional and contain many grammatical 
errors; they also originate from a different domain than the company 
they pretend to represent. For example, an email from PayPal should 
come from the PayPal.com domain and not from xyz.PayPal.com.
Whenever you suspect an email to be a phishing email, do not reply to it. To check 
whether it is a phishing email, rest your mouse (but don’t click) over the links in the 
email to see whether the address matches the link that was typed in the message or the 
sender domain name. In addition, do not supply any personal information if a phishing 
email asks you to fill any forms (see Figure 2-2).

Some attackers use URL-shortening services to mask the real phishing URL sent to 
the user. If you suspect that a short URL could be a scam, you can expand it using these 
free online services to see its destination:

If you suspect that you are a victim of a phishing attack, contact the Federal Trade 
Commission at https://www.ftc.gov/complaint and raise a complaint. You can report 
an identity theft on the same page if you suspect that someone or a company is misusing 
your private data. You can also file a complaint on the FBI website at https://www.ic3.
gov/complaint/default.aspx.
 Ransomware
Ransomware is malware that installs silently on the user’s computer or mobile device; it 
works by locking the user’s access to his files—or screen—by encrypting all user data on 
the device in addition to all the data on the attached storage devices (USB flash, external 
HDD, or SSD) and then requesting a ransom to remove the restriction. Some types of 
ransomware threaten victims to publish their data publicly if they refuse to pay the 
ransom. The ransom is usually paid through anonymous online payment methods like 
Bitcoin—which is a kind of digital currency—to get the decryption key.
Ransomware infection comes through a variety of methods. For example, a ransom 
could be attached to spam emails, installed upon visiting malicious websites, or installed 
as part of a legitimate program that has been modified by an attacker to conceal the 
ransomware within it. It can also get dropped by other malware such as a Trojan horse or 
exploit kits.
There are two main types of ransomware.
• 
The first type—also known as locker-ransomware locks the system 
screen in a way that is easy for an experienced computer user to 
unlock the restriction.
• 
The second type—also known as crypto-ransomware—encrypts 
whole disk drive or some files types, including all attached removable 
storage, and requests a ransom to remove the restriction.
A special variant of ransomware attacks the master boot record (MBR) of the 
vulnerable system, thus preventing the OS from booting unless the victim pays the ransom.
To counteract ransomware attacks, follow these steps:
 1. Back up all necessary files regularly. All operating system types 
have special backup functionality. In Windows 10, you can access 
the backup functionality through Windows Settings (Windows + I) 
➤ Update & Security ➤ Backup.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
28
 2. Regularly install all security patches for the operating system and 
all installed applications and keep them all up-to-date.
 3. Install antivirus and anti-malware solutions if possible and keep 
them up-to-date.
 4. Do not run macros in Microsoft Office files when receiving such 
files from an unknown user or when downloading them from the 
Internet.
If a ransom attack successfully compromises your system, follow these steps:
 1. Disconnect your computer from the network/Internet.
 2. Perform a full scan of all connected devices/storage media.
 3. Seek advice from a specialist to find out the ransomware type as 
there are removal tools available for specific ransomware families.
 4. Format affected devices if necessary and perform an OS reinstall.
 5. Restore your data from a previous clean backup.
 6. Inform law enforcement about the case and do not pay the ransom.
Tip Crypto Sheriff (https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.
php?lang=en) helps users recover from ransomware attacks by offering a free 
service to check the type of ransomware affecting your device and then helping 
you to download the decryption solution if available.
 Adware and Spyware
Adware is a kind of advertisement software that tracks users’ online activities to display 
corresponding ads, thus generating revenue for its author. It is usually installed as part of 
free Internet programs such as system utilities, games, or browser toolbars. You cannot 
consider all adware software as being malicious because many of them are installed 
as part of legitimate software that declares the existence of adware as part of its end- 
user license agreement (EULA). However, most users simply click the “I agree” button 
without knowing that they are installing adware on their machine.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
29
Spyware is another kind of tracking software; however, it is for malicious purposes 
only. Spyware monitors everything you type on your keyboard and sends it to its 
operator. Some types install other malware (like ransomware) on your machine to 
facilitate performing other malicious actions.
 Trojan
This is a kind of malicious computer program that installs silently on the victim machine. 
It enables its operator to have full control over the victim machine including the camera 
and microphone. Most of the popular banking threats come from a Trojan family like 
Zeus and SpyEye.
 Virus
This is what most non-computer-savvy users mean when talking about malicious 
computer programs. Viruses are considered one of the oldest traditional risks since the 
early days of personal computers. The main intent of a virus is to make the victim operating 
system inoperable, thus forcing the user to format it to return to its original state.
 Worms
The Morris worm, or Internet worm, was one of the first to be seen in the wild. In 
November 1988, it was distributed via the Internet and caused significant damage to the 
infected systems. This is now another type of old-school attack that is still widely used. The 
main intent of a worm is to spread from one machine to another through internal networks 
or the Internet to spread malicious code. By replicating itself, worms consume a great 
amount of network bandwidth—for example, sending files via emails—thus causing great 
damage to corporate networks. Worms can also install backdoors on computers.
 Scareware
Scareware is a kind of malicious software—also known as deception software, rogue 
scanner software, or fraudware—that tricks the victim into purchasing security software 
(such as antivirus and anti-malware) to remove the infection from their PC. For example, 
a user can see a pop-up message on their PC stating that it is infected with malware and 
should act promptly by purchasing a special anti-malware solution—which is fake!—to 
clean the PC. The idea here is to trick the user into purchasing something unnecessarily 
to take the user’s money.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
30
Worm infections can be mitigated through installing security software and keeping 
your OS and antivirus solution up-to-date.
 Distributed Denial of Service
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack happens when many compromised 
computing devices flood a target computer—for example, a server—with many fake 
requests simultaneously, making it unresponsive to serve legitimate users. This attack 
targets a large number of entities such as banks, shopping websites, and news agencies. 
Unlike other attacks that aim to steal confidential data, the main aim of a DDoS attack is 
to make your website and servers unavailable to legitimate users.
 Rootkits
A rootkit is a dangerous type of malware; it can potentially gain administrative access 
over the system and can prevent normal detection programs (antivirus and anti-rootkit 
programs) from noticing its presence. Some dangerous rootkits attack at the hardware 
level (firmware rootkit), and removal may require hardware replacement or specialized 
intervention.
Rootkit detection is difficult because there is no single security solution that can 
remove all known and unknown rootkits. However, there are many valuable programs 
that can remove a large number of rootkit types, as you’ll see later in the chapter. 
 Juice Jacking
This is a type of cyberattack where an attacker copies data or installs malware onto a 
victim’s smartphone/tablet when the victim connects a device—through USB cable—to 
a public charging station that has been modified to play a malicious role. Public charging 
stations can be found at airports, hotels, shopping centers, and conferences.
