Abstract. In this paper we make use of a large set of measurements
from a production wireless network in rural New Zealand to analyze the
performance of 28 path loss prediction models, published over the course
of 60 years. We propose ﬁve metrics to determine the performance of
each model. We show that the state of the art, even for the “simple”
case of rural environments, is surprisingly ill-equipped to make accurate
predictions. After combining the best elements of the best models and
hand-tuning their parameters, we are unable to achieve an accuracy of
better than 12 dB root mean squared error (RMSE)—four orders of
magnitude away from ground truth.
1 Introduction
Modeling the propagation of a wireless transmitter in a complex environment
has entertained scientists for at least sixty years. The result is a staggering num-
ber of proposals of just about every shape, size, and approach imaginable. The
basis for this level of interest is solid—predicting the attenuation of transmit-
ted signals with high precision has very important applications in the design,
trouble-shooting, and simulation of wireless systems.
Despite the large quantity of work done, we recognize an important shortcom-
ing: there have been relatively few comparative evaluations of path loss predic-
tion models using a suﬃciently representative dataset as a basis for evaluation.
Those studies that do exist make comparisons between a small number of similar
models. And, where there has been substantial work of serious rigor done, for in-
stance in the VHF bands where solid work in the 1960’s produced well validated
results for analog television (TV) propagation, it is not clear how well these
models work for making predictions outside their intended coverage (i.e., fre-
quency, distance, environment type, etc.). The result is that wireless researchers
are left without proper guidance in picking among dozens of propagation models
from which it is not clear which is best or what the penalty is of using a model
outside of its intended coverage. This work provides a ﬁrst step towards solving
that problem.

On The Eﬃcacy of Path Loss Models
43
In this paper, we describe, implement, and analyze 28 propagation models
spanning 60 years of publications using ﬁve metrics to gauge performance. Al-
though many of these models are massively diﬀerent from one another, they all
make use of the same basic variables on which to base their predictions: posi-
tion (including height and orientation) of the transmitter and receiver, carrier
frequency, and digital elevation model and land cover classiﬁcation along the
main line-of-sight (LOS) transmit path. These models are a mix of approaches:
empirical, (purely) analytical, stochastic or some combination thereof. In the
present study, we are not including ray-tracing models (e.g., [11]) or partition
based models (e.g., [5]) which require substantial knowledge of the environment
which is seldom available at all, and rarely at the precision required to make
useful predictions. We are also not considering active-measurement models (e.g.,
[8]) which make use of in-situ measurements to correct their predictions. We
expect to analyze these more complex models in later work.
To perform our evaluation we use a large set of active measurements collected
from a production wireless network on the northern isle of New Zealand. This
network spans approximately 8300 square kilometers, containing more than 368
transceivers (with 1328 possible links, 1246 of which are under measurement),
and provides Internet connectivity to more than 740 clients. The network is built
using commercial oﬀ-the-shelf equipment (COTSE) and operates in the popular
bands of unlicensed spectrum at 2.4 and 5.8 GHz. All of the measurements we
use will be released to the community to enable comparative evaluations.
2 Related Work
The vast majority of existing work analyzing the eﬃcacy of path loss models
has been carried out by those authors who are proposing their own improved
algorithm. In such cases, the authors collect data in an environment of inter-
est and show that their model is better able to describe this data than one
or two competing models. Unfortunately, this data is rarely published to the
community, which makes comparative evaluations impossible. One noteworthy
exception is the work of the COST-231 group in the early 1990’s, which pub-
lished a benchmark dataset (900 MHz measurements taken in European cities)
[3]. This eﬀort produced a number of well-validated models which are tuned for
900 MHz transmitters in urban environments. We consider all of the proposed
COST-231 models in our analysis here. The COST-231 data, being collected in
an urban environment, is inappropriate for our present work, but we expect to
use it in future work.
There are several studies similar to our own that compare a number of models
with respect to some data. In [4], the authors compare ﬁve models with respect to
data collected in rural and suburban environments with a mobile receiver at 910
MHz. They discuss the abilities of each model, but abstain from picking a winner.
In [1], the authors compare three popular models to measurements collected at
3.5 GHz. The authors highlight the best of the three, which turns out to be the
ECC-33 model proposed in [6]. In [9], Sharma et al. do a very similar analysis,
44

but instead focus on measurements made in India at 900 and 1800 MHz. In
contrast to [1], they ﬁnd that the SUI and COST-231 models perform best. We
believe our work here is the ﬁrst to do an in-depth and rigorous analysis of a
large number of diverse propagation models using a large and realistic dataset
from a production network. And, it is the ﬁrst such comparative study looking
at results for the widely used 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands.
3 Measurement
The network used in our
study is a large commercial
network that provides Inter-
net access to primarily ru-
ral segments of the Waikato
region in New Zealand. Ev-
ery two minutes, each device
on the network transmits a
measurement frame at each
supported bit-rate. For this
study we only use measure-
ments from the lowest bit-
rate for each protocol (1 Mbps
for 802.11b/g and 6 Mbps
for 802.11a). Meanwhile, each
device uses a monitor mode
interface to log these mea-
surement frames.
The back-haul network is
composed of
long distance
802.11a links operating at
5.8 GHz1. These are com-
monly point-to-point
links
that use
carefully steered
highly directional antennas.
The local access network is
composed of predominantly
802.11b/g links which provide
connectivity to client premise
equipment (CPEs). Often, an
802.11g access point with an
omnidirectional or sector an-
tenna will provide access to a dozen or more CPE devices which have directional
(patch panel) antennas pointing back to the access point. With few exceptions,
each node in the network is an embedded computer running the Linux operating
system which allows the use if standard open-source tools to perform measure-
ment and monitoring. All nodes under measurement use an Atheros-brand radio
Fig. 1. The largest of three disconnected sections
of the network (80x100km). Link width indicates
strength. Back-haul nodes (mainly 5.8 GHz) are
dark/black and CPEs are light/white.

and the MadWiﬁ driver is used to collect frames in monitor mode and record
received signal strengths. In [2], we showed that this hardware is able to measure
signal strength at a suﬃcient accuracy for path loss modeling.
After collection, the data requires fairly substantial scrubbing. We discard
any frame that arrives with its checksum in error or those from a source that
produces less than 100 packets. The remaining packets are used as an oracle to
analyze the performance of the propagation models. For this particular analysis
we use one week of data collected between July 25th, 2010 and August 2nd,
2010. Because detailed documentation about each node simply did not exist
prior to our study, some assumptions were made for analysis. The locations of
nodes for which there is no speciﬁc GPS reading are either hand-coded, or in
the case of some CPEs, geo-coded using a street address. Antenna orientations
for directional antennas are assumed to be ideal—pointing in the exact bearing
of their mate. All nodes are assumed to be positioned 3m oﬀ the ground, which
is roughly correct for the vast majority of nodes. While these assumptions are
not perfect, and are clearly a source of error, we feel that they are as accurate
as is feasible for a network of this size and complexity. Certainly, any errors in
antenna heights, locations, or orientations are on the same scale as those errors
would be for anyone using one of the propagation models we analyze to make
predictions about their own network.
In the end, our scrubbed data for a single week constitutes 19,235,611 measure-
ments taken on 1328 links (1262 802.11b/g links at 2.4 GHz and 464 802.11a links
at 5.8 GHz) from 368 participating nodes. Of these nodes, the vast majority are
clients and hence many of the antennas are of the patch panel variety (70%). Of
the remaining 30%, 21% are highly-directional point-to-point parabolic dishes,
4.5% are omnidirectional, and 4.5% are sector antennas. We believe this dataset
is of suﬃcient scope and diversity to justify the claim that it is representative of a
large class of wireless networks which have similar characteristics and operating
frequency.
4 Models
Table 1 provides details of the models evaluated in this study. We subdivide
models into ﬁve categories: Foundational models, which are purely theoretical
and (often) form the core of more advanced models, Basic models, which are
the majority and typically include empirical corrections from measurements and
often require special tuning parameters for the environment type, Terrain mod-
els, which expand on the basic models by including terrain features into their
calculations, and Supplementary models, which are not able to stand on their
own but instead are used to make corrections to existing models.
At a high level, a model’s task is to predict the value of Lt + Ls in this
log-domain equation:
1 Atypically liberal power regulations in New Zealand and Australia around 5.8 GHz
allow for much longer links than can be seen in most other places in the world.

Pr = Pt − (Lt + Ls + Lf (t))
(1)
Where Pr and Pt are the received and transmitted power and the total path loss
is the sum of Lt, the trivial free-space path loss, Ls, the loss due to shadowing/
slow-fading from large unmoving obstacles like mountains and buildings, and
Lf(t), the small-scale/fast fading due to destructive interference from multipath
eﬀects and small scatterers (which varies with time t). Models cannot, without
perfect knowledge of the environment, be expected to predict the quantity Lf(t).
In most applications, this additional error is computed “stochastically” using
a probability distribution. For the protocols used in our study, however, this
quantity tends to be small due to the averaging eﬀect of wide-band modulation
schemes [10].
It is worth noting that among the models we study, only very few were de-
signed with the exactly sort of network we are studying in mind. Indeed, some
are very speciﬁc about the type of environment in which they are to be used.
