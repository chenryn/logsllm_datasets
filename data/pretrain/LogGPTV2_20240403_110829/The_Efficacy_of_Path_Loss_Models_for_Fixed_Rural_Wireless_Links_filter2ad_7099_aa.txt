## Abstract
In this paper, we utilize a large dataset from a production wireless network in rural New Zealand to evaluate the performance of 28 path loss prediction models published over the past 60 years. We introduce five metrics to assess the performance of each model. Our findings indicate that even in the "simple" case of rural environments, the current state-of-the-art models are surprisingly inadequate for making accurate predictions. Despite combining the best elements of the top-performing models and fine-tuning their parameters, we were unable to achieve an accuracy better than 12 dB root mean squared error (RMSE), which is four orders of magnitude away from ground truth.

## 1. Introduction
Modeling the propagation of wireless signals in complex environments has been a subject of scientific interest for at least six decades. This has resulted in a vast array of proposals, varying in shape, size, and approach. The importance of accurately predicting signal attenuation is well-recognized, as it has significant applications in the design, troubleshooting, and simulation of wireless systems.

Despite the extensive work done in this field, a critical shortcoming remains: there have been relatively few comparative evaluations of path loss prediction models using sufficiently representative datasets. Existing studies often compare only a small number of similar models, and while some rigorous work has been done, particularly in the VHF bands for analog television (TV) propagation, it is unclear how well these models perform outside their intended coverage (e.g., frequency, distance, environment type).

This lack of comprehensive evaluation leaves wireless researchers without clear guidance on selecting the most appropriate propagation model. Our work aims to address this gap by providing a detailed and rigorous analysis of 28 diverse propagation models using a large, realistic dataset from a production network operating in the widely used 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands.

## 2. Related Work
Most existing studies on the efficacy of path loss models are conducted by authors proposing their own improved algorithms. These studies typically collect data in specific environments and demonstrate that their model outperforms one or two competing models. Unfortunately, the data used in these studies is rarely made available, making comparative evaluations impossible.

One notable exception is the COST-231 group's work in the early 1990s, which published a benchmark dataset of 900 MHz measurements taken in European cities. This effort produced several well-validated models tuned for 900 MHz transmitters in urban environments. While the COST-231 data is not suitable for our rural study, we include all proposed COST-231 models in our analysis.

Other studies, such as [4], [1], and [9], have compared a few models with respect to data collected in various environments. However, our work is the first to conduct an in-depth and rigorous analysis of a large number of diverse propagation models using a large, realistic dataset from a production network operating in the 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands.

## 3. Measurement
The network used in our study is a large commercial network providing Internet access to primarily rural areas in the Waikato region of New Zealand. Every two minutes, each device on the network transmits a measurement frame at the lowest supported bit-rate (1 Mbps for 802.11b/g and 6 Mbps for 802.11a). These frames are logged using a monitor mode interface.

The back-haul network consists of long-distance 802.11a links operating at 5.8 GHz, commonly point-to-point links with highly directional antennas. The local access network is composed of 802.11b/g links, providing connectivity to client premise equipment (CPEs) using omnidirectional or sector antennas.

All nodes in the network run the Linux operating system, allowing the use of standard open-source tools for measurement and monitoring. The hardware used is Atheros-brand radios with the MadWi-Fi driver, which has been shown to measure signal strength with sufficient accuracy for path loss modeling.

After collection, the data undergoes substantial cleaning. Frames with checksum errors or from sources producing fewer than 100 packets are discarded. The remaining data is used to analyze the performance of the propagation models. For this analysis, we used one week of data collected between July 25th, 2010, and August 2nd, 2010.

Our cleaned dataset includes 19,235,611 measurements from 1328 links (1262 802.11b/g links at 2.4 GHz and 464 802.11a links at 5.8 GHz) from 368 participating nodes. The majority of these nodes are clients, with 70% using patch panel antennas, 21% using highly directional parabolic dishes, 4.5% using omnidirectional antennas, and 4.5% using sector antennas. We believe this dataset is sufficiently representative of a large class of wireless networks with similar characteristics and operating frequencies.

## 4. Models
Table 1 provides details of the 28 models evaluated in this study, categorized into Foundational, Basic, Terrain, and Supplementary models. At a high level, a model's task is to predict the value of \( L_t + L_s \) in the log-domain equation:

\[
P_r = P_t - (L_t + L_s + L_f(t))
\]

Where \( P_r \) and \( P_t \) are the received and transmitted power, respectively. The total path loss is the sum of \( L_t \), the free-space path loss, \( L_s \), the loss due to shadowing/slow-fading from large obstacles, and \( L_f(t) \), the small-scale/fast fading due to multipath effects. Models cannot predict \( L_f(t) \) without perfect knowledge of the environment, so this additional error is often computed stochastically using a probability distribution.

It is worth noting that very few of the models we studied were designed specifically for the type of network we are analyzing. Some models are very specific about the environment in which they should be used.

## 5. Results
### Overall Performance of Models
The overall performance of the models is summarized in Figure 1, which shows the RMSE and spread-corrected RMSE for each model. Despite combining the best elements of the top-performing models and fine-tuning their parameters, the best accuracy achieved was 12 dB RMSE, which is significantly higher than the desired accuracy.

## 6. Conclusion
Our analysis of 28 path loss prediction models using a large, realistic dataset from a production wireless network in rural New Zealand highlights the inadequacy of current models in making accurate predictions. The best models, even after fine-tuning, could not achieve an accuracy better than 12 dB RMSE. This work provides a foundation for future research aimed at improving the accuracy of path loss models in rural environments.
