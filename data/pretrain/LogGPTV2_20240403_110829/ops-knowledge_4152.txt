User: How to realize the diagnosis and troubleshooting of network delay and packet loss, and quickly find and solve the problem when the network fails? Please provide a detailed network troubleshooting process.
Assistant: The diagnosis and troubleshooting process of network delay and packet loss can be divided into the following steps: 1. Confirm the fault phenomenon: When the user finds that the network connection is slow or data loss occurs, the user first needs to confirm whether the fault phenomenon occurs on the local device or other nodes in the network superior. 2. Check the hardware device: Check whether the hardware device of the local device is working normally, such as network card, network cable, router, switch and other devices, and replace the device or port connection if necessary. 3. Check the network connection: use the ping command or the traceroute command to test the current network connection, such as checking whether the base station is connected normally, whether the ISP service provider is normal, etc. 4. Analyze network traffic: Use network monitoring tools or packet capture tools to analyze network traffic to find out whether the network traffic is normal. For example, traffic analysis tools such as Wireshark. 5. Reverse trace: Determine the specific location and cause of network failures. In real-world scenarios, network failures can occur in multiple locations, requiring reverse tracing of network computers and routers. The IP address, gateway and router names should be included in the trace. 6. Troubleshooting: To fix the specific cause of the problem, you can adjust the network or replace the network equipment. If necessary, you can seek help from the ISP service provider. In general, diagnosing and troubleshooting network delay and packet loss through the above steps can help users quickly find the problem and solve network failures.
