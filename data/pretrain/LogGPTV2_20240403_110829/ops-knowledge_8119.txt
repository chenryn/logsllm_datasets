To effectively implement CIS Control 15.4, which ensures that service provider contracts include security requirements, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Define Security Requirements**: Clearly specify the minimum security program requirements in the contract. These may include:
   - Security incident and data breach notification and response protocols.
   - Data encryption standards.
   - Data disposal commitments.

2. **Align with Internal Policies**: Ensure that the security requirements are consistent with the organization's service provider management policy. This alignment is crucial to maintain a cohesive and robust security posture.

3. **Annual Review**: Conduct an annual review of all service provider contracts to ensure they meet the necessary security requirements. This review process helps to identify and address any gaps or outdated provisions.

4. **Documentation and Compliance**: Maintain thorough documentation of all security requirements and compliance measures. This documentation should be readily accessible for internal and external audits.

CIS Control 15.4 falls under the "Protect" security function and does not have a specific asset type associated with it (N/A).

By following these steps, organizations can ensure that their service provider contracts are comprehensive and aligned with their overall security strategy.
