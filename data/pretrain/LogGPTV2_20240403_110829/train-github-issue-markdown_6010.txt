CSG is a very important featureâ€¦ other 3D frameworks have support for CSG
built-in ( Babylon.js ), the only CSG I can find is the 7 years outdated
plugin ( https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG )
I propose that this plug-in gets updated for bufferGeometry and added to the
three.js code base as an official plug-in for CSG support.
I am willing to contribute funds to see this happen.
