User: if i want to script a mini-application (in the Terminal) in mac and windows, which one is preferred: ruby or python?
or is there no major difference just a matter of taste?
cause i know python definetely is a good scripting language.
thanks
Assistant: Both are excelent options, you won't go wrong no  matter which one you chose. You should check out the availability of libraries for the task at hand and also how helpful the community is. The Python community is humongous and seems friendlier to me. Rubists seem to have some anger management issues.
