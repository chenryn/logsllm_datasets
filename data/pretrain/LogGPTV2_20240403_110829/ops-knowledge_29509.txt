User: I am writing an application which uses the Google user API and anyone having a google account can login. I would want to prevent from multiple users using the same google account to login simultaneously. Basically, I would like to allow only 1 user / account to be using my application. As I am running a subscription service, I need to restrict users sharing accounts and simultaneously logging in.
Can I accomplish this somehow in App Engine using Users module? If not, can someone please suggest an alternate mechanism?
I am using Python on App Engine.
Assistant: Yes you can, but you'll have to build the session tracking functionality yourself.
