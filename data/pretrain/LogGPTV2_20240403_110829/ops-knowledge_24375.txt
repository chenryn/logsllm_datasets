User: How to set up Linux server hardware monitoring, and which hardware indicators can be monitored?
Assistant: To set up hardware monitoring for Linux servers, you can use some tools and programs, such as: 1. lm-sensors: It can be used to monitor hardware parameters such as CPU temperature, fan speed, and voltage. 2. htop: This program can be used to view the running status of the entire system, including indicators such as CPU utilization, memory and disk usage. 3. iostat: It can be used to monitor the hard disk I/O activity of the system. 4. top: This program can be used to view the status of the current processes and threads of the system. 5. iftop: It can be used to monitor the network activities of the system, such as indicators such as traffic and number of connections. Which hardware metrics to monitor depends on the specific hardware device and application, but in general, the following metrics can be monitored: 1. CPU temperature and fan speed. 2. Memory and disk usage. 3. Disk I/O activity and network activity. 4. CPU load and process/thread status. 5. Power status and voltage.
