ABSTRACT
Darknet markets are online services behind Tor where cybercrimi-
nals trade illegal goods and stolen datasets. In recent years, secu-
rity analysts and law enforcement start to investigate the darknet
markets to study the cybercriminal networks and predict future
incidents. However, vendors in these markets often create multiple
accounts (i.e., Sybils), making it challenging to infer the relation-
ships between cybercriminals and identify coordinated crimes.
In this paper, we present a novel approach to link the multiple
accounts of the same darknet vendors through photo analytics. The
core idea is that darknet vendors often have to take their own prod-
uct photos to prove the possession of the illegal goods, which can
reveal their distinct photography styles. To fingerprint vendors, we
construct a series deep neural networks to model the photography
styles. We apply transfer learning to the model training, which
allows us to accurately fingerprint vendors with a limited number
of photos. We evaluate the system using real-world datasets from 3
large darknet markets (7,641 vendors and 197,682 product photos).
A ground-truth evaluation shows that the system achieves an accu-
racy of 97.5%, outperforming existing stylometry-based methods
in both accuracy and coverage. In addition, our system identifies
previously unknown Sybil accounts within the same markets (23)
and across different markets (715 pairs). Further case studies re-
veal new insights into the coordinated Sybil activities such as price
manipulation, buyer scam, and product stocking and reselling.

the law enforcement to trace their activities and build proactive de-
fenses [2, 23, 35]. Meanwhile, underground forums, particularly the
darknet markets behind Tor [12], are increasingly popular among
cybercriminals to anonymously trade illegal goods and stolen items
(e.g., credit cards, datasets). These platforms thus become the key
information source for investigating the cybercrime ecosystem and
predicting future incidents [42, 48].
As the key aspect of the investigation, researchers have been
seeking to understand the relationships between cybercriminals
and identify the stakeholders. Prior works have examined the social
networks in underground forums to understand the user interac-
tions [14, 15, 38, 60]. In the darknet markets, however, the key
challenge of such investigation is that darknet vendors often main-
tain multiple accounts (or Sybil accounts) within the same market or
across different markets. Without linking these accounts together,
analysts might miss key opportunities to reveal the true relation-
ships between cybercriminals and identify coordinated activities.
Unfortunately, due to growing scale of the darknet markets, it
is highly labor-intensive to manually investigate and link multi-
ple accounts. To solve this problem, existing approaches rely on
stylometry analysis, which aims to link Sybil accounts based on
their writing styles [1, 22]. Stylometry analysis has shown success
in fingerprinting underground forum users where users post rich
and diverse text, but it faces key challenges to fingerprint vendors
in the darknet markets. First, the only available text in the dark-
net markets are product descriptions, which are short, repetitive,
and often follow certain templates. Second, stylometry analysis is
sensitive to the language of the content, which is a disadvantage
to analyze darknet markets where vendors come from different
countries (validated in §5).
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to link multiple iden-
tities in the darknet markets by analyzing the product photos. Our
goal is to build reliable fingerprints to re-identify the vendors based
on their photos within the same market or even across different mar-
kets. This idea is motivated by the fact that darknet vendors often
have to take photos for their own products (instead of using stock
photos) to prove the possession of the illegal goods or stolen items.
Such photos can reflect a vendor’s personal style of photography.
To build accurate fingerprints, we develop a system where a series
of deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to extract distinct features
from a vendor’s photos automatically. In addition, to fingerprint
vendors with relatively fewer photos, we apply transfer learning to
pre-train the deep neural network with large generic image datasets
and fine-tune the model with vendor-specific photos.
We evaluate the proposed system using real-world datasets from
3 large darknet markets (Agora, Evolution, SilkRoad2), which in-
volves 7,641 vendors and 197,682 product photos. We first conduct
a “ground-truth” evaluation by splitting a vendor’s photos into two
random parts and examining how accurately the system can link the
two parts back. Our best performing model achieves an accuracy of
97.5% or higher for all three markets. In addition, we compare our
approach with existing stylometry methods that model a vendor’s
writing styles based on the product descriptions. We demonstrate
that image-based approach excels in both accuracy of classification
and the coverage of “fingerprint-able” vendors.
To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method, we apply
our system to detect previously unknown Sybil accounts in the wild.
Based on manual examinations and external evidence, we confirm
that our system detected 715 Sybil pairs across different markets
and 23 Sybil account pairs within the same markets. Further case
studies reveal new insights into the coordinated activities of Sybil
accounts, ranging from price manipulation and buyer scam, to
product stocking and reselling, and photo plagiarizing. For example,
we identify vendors on Evolution and SilkRoad2 who creates Sybil
accounts that only sell a handful of products but at a much lower
price. Some of the Sybil vendors are confirmed to have scammed the
buyers based on external evidence. In addition, the detected Sybil
pairs also reveal the relationships between vendors (e.g., suppliers
and retailers) which helps to identify the market stakeholders.
In summary, our contributions are three folds:
• First, we present the first system to fingerprint darknet
vendors by modeling their unique styles of photography.
• Second, we perform ground-truth evaluations on the pro-
posed system. Results show that the photo-based approach
outperforms existing stylometry analysis in both accuracy
and coverage.
• Third, we apply the system to detect previously unknown
Sybil accounts in the wild. Extensive analysis of the detected
Sybil pairs reveals new insights into the cybercriminal activ-
ities within and across darknet markets.
Our study is part of an ongoing effort to develop useful tools
to assist the law enforcement and criminal analysts to investigate
the cybercriminal networks. Our proposed method can contribute
to building profiles of cybercriminals, establishing darknet vendor
networks, understanding of darknet vendor reputation systems, and
the study of the migration of vendors across different marketplaces.
As a future work, we are interested in investigating how Sybils
vendors can evade the detection by hiding their personal styles
(detailed discussion in §8).
2 BACKGROUND AND GOALS
In this section, we introduce the background of darknet market-
places and describe our research goals.
Tor (short for “The Onion Router”)
Tor and Darknet Markets.
is the most widely used tool for anonymous communications on the
Internet [12]. Tor conceals a user’s IP and location by redirecting
her network traffic through a large overlay network consisting
of thousands of relays. Tor not only protects users from network
surveillance and censorship but also helps a large number of darknet
websites to operate anonymously. Users can access darknet websites
through Tor without knowing their actual IP or location. However,
the anonymity also creates a challenge for the law enforcement to
trace the illegal websites in the darknet [17].
Darknet market is a particular type of trading website in the
darknet. Most of the darknet markets are set up by cybercriminals
around the world to trade illegal goods (e.g., drugs, fire weapons),
stolen items (e.g., credit cards, password datasets), software exploits,
and even criminal/hacking services. Researchers have collected em-
pirical datasets from darknet markets to study the products offered,
the revenue and the market dynamics over time [17, 48]. A key dif-
ference between the darknet markets and traditional underground
forums [2, 15, 23, 27, 35, 42] is that darknet markets are hosted
behind Tor, making them difficult to trace and take down.
To study the devel-

opment of darknet markets, a key challenge is to trace and link
user identifies in the markets. Users, particularly the vendors, of-
ten create multiple identities (i.e., Sybil accounts) within the same
markets or across different markets [1, 22]. The Sybil identities are
created either to increase sales or even scam buyers. Due to the
strong anonymity of darknet users, it is difficult to effectively link
user identities based on traditional IPs or device fingerprints. In
addition, given the large number of darknet markets and the user
accounts, manual investigation faces key challenges to scale up.
Recently, researchers have explored to

use stylometry to link a user’s multiple identities. Stylometry anal-
ysis is a standard technique to attribute authorship of anonymous
texts by modeling the writing style. The techniques have shown
success in re-identifying users in online forums [28, 33, 49] and fin-
gerprinting the programmers of software code [6]. A related work
has explored to attribute the authorship based on users’ public and
private messages posted on underground forums [1].
Directly applying stylometry analysis to darknet markets faces
key challenges. First, stylometry analysis requires lengthy text
to model a user’s writing style. Unlike the rich and diverse text
messages available in online forums, the only text on the darknet
markets are the product descriptions posted by the vendors. The
product descriptions are usually short and repetitive (following
certain templates). In addition, the product descriptions are often
written in different languages by vendors from all over the world,
making it difficult to perform stylometry analysis. We have con-
firmed these challenges in §5.
In this paper, we develop novel tools to fingerprint

vendors in the darknet marketplaces. The goal is to help investiga-
tors to identify and link the multiple identities controlled by the
same vendors by analyzing the posted product photos. This idea is
motivated by two key intuitions. First, unlike regular e-commerce
websites (e.g., Amazon), darknet vendors often need to take pic-
tures of their illegal goods by themselves. Second, photographs can
reflect the photographers’ unique personal styles [16, 24, 56].
Our exploration contains three key steps: First, we seek to use
the product photos posted by vendors to build a distinct profile (or
fingerprint) for each vendor. We propose to extract the distinct fea-
tures from their photos using deep neural networks (§4). Second, we
seek to compare (and potentially augment) the photo-based finger-
prints with traditional stylometry analysis on product descriptions
(§5). Finally, we apply our system in the wild to identify previously
unknown Sybils accounts both within the same markets and across
different markets (§6). We perform case studies to understand the

tool (§7).
3 DATASET
To examine the possibility of profiling darknet vendors, we leverage
the public archive of darknet market datasets [5]. The data archive
contains the daily (sometimes weekly) snapshots of the darknet
markets crawled by researchers from 2013 to 2015. Each snapshot
contains the raw product pages of the respective marketplace. In this
paper, we select 3 largest markets: Agora, Evolution, and SilkRoad2.
For each market, we wrote a customized parser to extract struc-
tured data for the product pages. For each product, we obtain the
product ID, product description, product image, vendorID, the ven-
dor’s pseudo name, and the timestamps when the product was
actively listed on the market. Table 1 shows the basic statistics.
Below, we briefly introduce the background of the 3 markets and
validate the data integrity.
SilkRoad2: established in November 2013, SilkRoad2 was the
successor of the well-known market SilkRoad (taken down
by FBI in October 2013) [11]. Due to the brand attraction of
SilkRoad, SilkRoad2 quickly became the largest darknet mar-
ket in 2014. In February 2014, SilkRoad2 was compromised,
losing 2.6 million USD worth bitcoins, which led to a major
damage to its reputation [4]. On November 6, 2014, SilkRoad2
was taken down by authorities and its administrator was
also arrested.
Evolution: established in January 2014, Evolution was the
largest darknet marketplace after the taken down of SilkRoad2.
In March 2015, the administrators of Evolution unexpectedly
shut down the market and took away all the bitcoins that
users deposited to the market, the value of which was esti-
mated to be 11.7 million US dollars [58]. The site then went
offline since this “exit scam”.
Agora: established in 2013, Agora once became the largest
market after the taken down of SilkRoad 2 and the exit scam
of Evolution [48]. The market was taken offline by its admin-
istrators due to security vulnerabilities in August 2015, and
stayed offline since then.
Although all three markets went offline, the dataset provides a
unique opportunity to retrospectively study the vendor behavior
and inform the investigation of the emerging markets. As shown
in Table 1, we extracted in total 211,665 products listed by 8,691
vendors from the three markets. 7,641 of the vendors have posted at
least one product image (88%). In total, we obtained 197,682 product
images. We find that the distribution of the image count per vendor
exhibits a long-tail property as shown in Figure 1. Note that vendors
sometimes use the same image for different products, and thus we
