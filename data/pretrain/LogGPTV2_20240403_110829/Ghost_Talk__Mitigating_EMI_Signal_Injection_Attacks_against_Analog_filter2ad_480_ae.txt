U.S. National Institute for Technology and Standards (NIST)
issued the FIPS 140-2 document [36] that speciﬁes defense
techniques against electromagnetic radiation exﬁltration for
unintentional radiators and digital devices conformant to
requirements from 47 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 15,
Subpart B, Class A and B. We didn’t expect commodity
electronics to be compliant with FIPS 140-2; however we
were surprised at how easy it was to penetrate the device’s
analog sensing system with rogue signals. Given how com-
modity and COTS electronics are on today’s critical path, it
is essential to understand the extent of the vulnerabilities on
the analog sensing circuit.
Electromagnetic compatibility. The ﬁeld of electromag-
netic compatibility (EMC) is largely devoted to avoiding,
minimizing or coping with induced voltages on electronic
circuits but the proposed techniques have not been imple-
mented in most of the devices tested in this work. The
techniques include the removal of random noise, similar to
broadband additive white Gaussian (AWG) noise, or narrow
band interferences. In both of those classes of noise, the
signals are considered benign. We focused on malicious
signal injection using an in-band signal to obscure the actual
signal. Disruption to digital circuits by intentional and high-
intensity radiation have been investigated by Mansson [4],
although signal injection was not directly considered.
Medical devices. Halperin et al. have demonstrated vul-
nerabilities speciﬁcally in IMDs, but this work is funda-
mentally different in its approach [39]. Whereas Halperin
et al. identiﬁed vulnerabilities in the digital control channel
used to communicate with IMDs, this work exploits the
Fault
injection. The use of hardware fault
injection
to cause a security breach has been investigated previ-
ously [16], [37], [38]. Those attacks are focused only on
the digital circuit with the goal of corrupting memory and
forcing execution of arbitrary code. This work does not alter
the logic of the system, but it exploits a vulnerability in the
analog inputs to alter the behavior of the system based on
the current unaltered programming logic.

Cardiac tissue response to pacing pulses. Top: No pacing.
Middle: Pacing pulse during the absolute refractory period. Bottom: Pacing
pulse after the absolute refractory period. Note that
the cardiac wave
happens right after our pacing pulse.
During a cardiac probe test, it is possible for an attacker
to attempt to cheat the test by sending a high-amplitude
pulse during the absolute refractory period, even though
the real cardiac tissue is not reacting. Since the attack is
blind, the attacker doesn’t see the actual cardiac signals;
consequently aiming for the ARP will essentially be a
random hit. Therefore the probability of landing in the
ARP is P r[ARP ] = tarp
, where tarp is the absolute
refractory period, and tinterval is the beat-to-beat interval.
To reduce the attacker’s probability of success, it is possible
to do multiple probes, forcing an attacker to be repeatedly
successful in sending pulses in the ARP to avoid detection.
To inhibit pacing successfully, the forged pulses need to be
sent continuously. The probability of success thus decreases
with the number of probes, but not as fast as having
the pulses be independent events. Thus, the probability of
avoiding detection has a lower bound of P r[ARP ]n, where
n is the number of probes used.

4) Reverting to a Safe Default:
If the previous test
determines that the signal is not trustworthy, the system
has three options: 1. Disconnect the output from the input;
2. Limit the output to a known safe range; or 3. remove
the victim from the environment. In the ﬁrst case, we can
revert to asynchronous pacing – Atrial (AOO), Ventricular
(VOO) or Dual (DOO) – as programmed by the medical
personnel. In the second case, the output can depend on the

This work also adopts an attack approach that is widely
applicable to electronics with analog sensing inputs, not
constrained to any particular protocol or speciﬁc sensor.
CIEDs have been reported to be affected by static mag-
netic ﬁelds [40] but only at very short distances of under
3 cm, and Low Frequency RFID emissions [24] but the
waveforms were not intentionally crafted to force a mis-
sense on the device.
In their work on bounding the distance between the com-
munication device and an implantable medical device [41],
Rassmussen et al. noted that the receiving microphone was
sensitive to electromagnetic interference. Our work goes
deeper in analyzing signal injection using RF waveforms.
We offer an analysis of the root causes of the vulnerability
and develop an attack model using signal injection. We
evaluated our attacks on a number of devices including
commodity electronics and implantable medical devices.
VII. CONCLUSION
Analog sensors intrinsically trust what they measure, and
digital systems trust
the input provided by sensors. As
a result, intentional electromagnetic interference can trick
sensors into providing bogus information to higher-level
applications. Implications range from causing pacemakers to
stop pacing to injecting chosen touch-tone numbers during
phone calls with a Bluetooth headset
to an automated
bank service center. For distances under 5 cm for an 10 W
adversary, our experiments found no clinically relevant risks
for completely implanted medical devices. In free air, our
experiments caused measurable interference at 1-2 m. We
do not believe the current situation reveals an urgent public
health risk. Our proposed defenses include traditional analog
shielding as well as a digital signal contamination metric
based on the root mean square of waveform amplitudes. Our
cardiac defense mechanism detects suspicious sensor input
by checking whether pacing pulses are consistent with the
refractory period of cardiac tissue. Secure websites follow
the principle of not trusting unvalidated user input, and the
analog of this advice should resonate for sensor systems too.
