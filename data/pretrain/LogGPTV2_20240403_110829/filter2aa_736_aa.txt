# VLAN Layer 2 Attacks: Relevance and Mitigation

## Introduction
- **Security is only as strong as the weakest link.**
- Layer 2 attacks, though well-known, remain a significant threat in modern networking environments.
- According to the 2007 CSI/FBI security survey, 9 out of 19 types of attacks can target routers and switches.

## Common Layer 2 Attack Vectors
- **ARP Attacks**
- **MAC Flooding/CAM Table Overflow Attacks**
- **DHCP Starvation Attacks**
- **CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) Attacks**
- **Spanning-Tree Attacks**
- **Multicast Brute Force**
- **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) Attacks**
- **Private VLAN Attacks**
- **VLAN Hopping Attacks**
- **Double-Encapsulated 802.1Q/Nested VLAN Attacks**
- **VLAN Management Policy Server (VMPS)/VLAN Query Protocol (VQP) Attacks**

## Equipment Vulnerable to Layer 2 Attacks
- **Routers:** Cisco 3600, 2600
- **Switches:** Cisco 2900, 3500, 4006
- **Wireless Devices:** Netgear & Cisco-Linksys

## Tools for Conducting Layer 2 Attacks
- **Scapy**
- **Yersinia**
- **Macof**
- **TCPDump**
- **Cain & Abel**
- **EtterCap**
- **Ethereal (now Wireshark)**

## Case Study: ARP Poisoning
- **Example:** Metasploit.com ISP PIMPED!
- **Details:**
  - ARP poisoning was used to redirect traffic.
  - Example log entries:
    - `13:04:39.768055 00:15:f2:4b:cd:3a > 00:15:f2:4b:d0:c9, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 60: arp reply 216.75.15.1 is-at 00:15:f2:4b:cd:3a`
    - `13:04:40.397616 00:15:f2:4b:cd:3a > 00:15:f2:4b:d0:c9, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 60: arp reply 216.75.15.1 is-at 00:05:dc:0c:84:00`
    - `13:04:40.397686 00:15:f2:4b:cd:3a > 00:15:f2:4b:d0:c9, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 60: arp reply 216.75.15.1 is-at 00:15:f2:4b:cd:3a`

## Mitigation Strategies
### ARP Poisoning
- **Port Security:** Non-changing ARP entries.
- **DHCP Snooping:** Maintains a record of MAC addresses connected to ARP ports.
- **Arpwatch:** Listens to ARP replies.
- **ArpON:** Additional tool for ARP monitoring.

### MAC Flooding
- **Impact:** Switch ports act like a hub when overloaded, causing the CAM table to fill and the switch to broadcast frames to all ports.
- **Tools for Attack:**
  - Dsniff
  - Macof
  - Cain & Abel
  - Ettercap
- **Mitigation:**
  - Limit the number of MAC addresses per port.
  - Configure static MAC addresses (not scalable but highly secure).

### DHCP Starvation
- **Attack Methods:**
  - DHCP scope exhaustion (client spoofs other clients).
  - Installation of a rogue DHCP server.
- **Tools:**
  - Yersinia
  - Gobbler
- **Mitigation:**
  - Limit the number of MAC addresses per switch port.
  - Use DHCP Snooping to monitor and restrict DHCP traffic.

### CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) Attacks
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - CDP communicates in clear text and is unauthenticated.
  - CDP Denial of Service (DoS) due to software bugs.
  - CDP cache overflow can reset the switch.
  - Power exhaustion by claiming to be a VoIP phone.
  - CDP cache pollution with false information.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Disable CDP if not needed.
  - Regularly update IOS and CatOS to the latest versions.
  - Example commands:
    - `Router # no cdp enable`
    - `Switch (enable) set cdp disable 1/23`

## Conclusion
- Layer 2 attacks are still relevant and can have severe consequences.
- Proper configuration and regular updates are crucial for mitigating these threats.
- Understanding and implementing the right security measures can significantly reduce the risk of such attacks.
