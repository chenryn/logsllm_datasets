### Experimental Setup
For both Inet and GT-ITM, we generated 2k, 4k, and 16k data sets using the methodology described in Section 2. In all server selection experiments, we assumed that there is only one service available in the network, and all nodes act as both clients and servers. Clients are not allowed to select themselves as their servers. For each data set, we ran five experiments, and the cumulative distributions of server selection penalties are presented in Figure 14.

### Key Findings
1. **Synthesized Data Accuracy**:
   - The synthesized 2k and 4k DS2 data sets yield virtually identical results to the 2k and 3997-node measured data, even though they are synthesized from only 1k and 2k measured data samples, respectively.

2. **Performance Underestimation with Inet**:
   - Using the Inet delay model significantly underestimates the performance of Vivaldi. The results suggest that Vivaldi performs no better than random server selection when evaluated using Inet, but it performs much better than random selection when evaluated using measured or DS2 data. Thus, using Inet as a delay model can lead to false conclusions about Vivaldi's performance.

3. **Absolute Performance Differences**:
   - Although the relative performance rank of the three algorithms is consistent across all four delay models, the absolute performance estimated with Inet and GT-ITM differs dramatically from the results achieved with measured or DS2 data. For example, on the 3997-node measured data, 40.4% of the servers chosen by Meridian are within 1ms of the closest servers, while this number is 17.2% and 50.4% on 4k Inet and 4k GT-ITM data, respectively.

4. **Scaling Performance**:
   - The experiment based on the 16k DS2 synthetic data indicates that Vivaldi's performance should remain nearly constant under scaling. However, this is not the case with Inet and GT-ITM delay models. Similarly, Meridian's performance degrades more rapidly on Inet and GT-ITM than on DS2 data with increasing network size. This highlights the importance of having good delay space models that go beyond our ability to measure, as important performance trends sometimes only show at scale.

### 6.2 Structured Overlay Networks
Structured overlay networks like Chord, Kademlia, and Pastry use proximity neighbor selection (PNS) to choose overlay neighbors. PNS has been shown to effectively reduce routing stretch, query delay, and network load, and to increase overlay robustness to failures and certain security attacks.

#### Importance of Good Delay Space Models
To evaluate the effectiveness of PNS, we assume in our simulations that the overlay chooses neighbors using perfect PNS, i.e., the closest node is chosen among all overlay nodes that satisfy the structural constraints imposed by a routing table entry. Unless otherwise stated, the results in this section have been evaluated on a 4000-node overlay network using FreePastry, where the delay space used was either based on measured data, DS2, Inet, or GT-ITM.

#### Metrics Evaluated
1. **Overlay In-degree**:
   - The number of overlay nodes that have a given node in their routing tables.
2. **Hop Length Distribution**:
   - Determines the latency and network load of overlay lookups.
3. **Route Convergence**:
   - Measures the fraction of shared paths between two nodes located at distance \(d\) from each other. This metric is important for dynamic caching and the efficiency of multicast distribution trees.

#### Results
- **Figure 15** shows that the results agree very well for the measured delay data and DS2 data on all three metrics, while the results with the Inet and GT-ITM models differ significantly.
  - **In-degree**: The Inet model yields different results due to the power-law connectivity, making the closest leaf node of high-degree hubs the nearest neighbor for many nodes.
  - **Hop Length Distribution**: The first hop of overlay routes with the Inet model is significantly larger than the first hop obtained with measured delay data.
  - **Route Convergence**: Route convergence with Inet/GT-ITM is higher than with measured data. These deviations are rooted in the differences in the D(k)/D(N) growth metric and the local clustering in-degree metric among the delay models.

#### Impact on Application Performance
- **Eclipse Attacks**:
  - Singh et al. [37] argue that PNS alone is a weak defense against Eclipse attacks. While earlier work showed that PNS is effective based on simulations with a GT-ITM delay model, Singh et al. demonstrated that the defense breaks down when using measured delay data. We repeated their simulations using DS2 data and confirmed that the results match the simulations with measured data. Moreover, we showed that the effectiveness of PNS against Eclipse attacks continues to diminish as we increase the network size beyond the scale of measured delay data.
  
- **Proactive Replication**:
  - The benefits of proactive replication in structured overlays to reduce overlay lookup hops and latency have been explored by Beehive [28]. We experimented with a simple prototype that does proactive replication based on the number of desired replicas of an object. The placement of replicas is biased towards nodes that share a longer prefix with the object identifier, to intercept a large fraction of the overlay routes towards the home node of the object. We evaluated the query lookup latency as a function of the total number of replicas.

This analysis underscores the importance of using accurate delay models to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions about the performance of overlay networks and their defenses.
