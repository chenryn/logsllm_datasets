Abstract
Much attention has been paid to passwords chosen by
English speaking users, yet only a few studies have
examined how non-English speaking users select pass-
words. In this paper, we perform an extensive, empirical
analysis of 73.1 million real-world Chinese web pass-
words in comparison with 33.2 million English coun-
terparts. We highlight a number of interesting struc-
tural and semantic characteristics in Chinese password-
s. We further evaluate the security of these passwords
by employing two state-of-the-art cracking techniques.
In particular, our cracking results reveal the bifacial-
security nature of Chinese passwords. They are weaker
against online guessing attacks (i.e., when the allowed
guess number is small, 1∼104) than English passwords.
But out of the remaining Chinese passwords, they are
stronger against ofﬂine guessing attacks (i.e., when the
guess number is large, >105) than their English coun-
terparts. This reconciles two conﬂicting claims about
the strength of Chinese passwords made by Bonneau
(IEEE S&P’12) and Li et al. (Usenix Security’14 and
IEEE TIFS’16). At 107 guesses, the success rate of
our improved PCFG-based attack against the Chinese
datasets is 33.2%∼49.8%, indicating that our attack can
crack 92% to 188% more passwords than the state of the
art. We also discuss the implications of our ﬁndings for
password policies, strength meters and cracking.
1 Introduction
Textual passwords are the dominant form of access con-
trol in almost every web service today. Although their
security pitfalls were revealed as early as four decades
ago [39] and various alternative authentication methods
(e.g., graphical passwords and multi-factor authentica-
tion) have been proposed since then, passwords are still
widely used. For one reason, passwords offer many
advantages, such as low deployment cost, easy recovery,
and remarkable simplicity, which cannot always be of-
fered by other authentication methods [6]. For another
reason, there is a lack of effective tools to quantify the
less obvious costs of replacing passwords [8] because
the marginal gains are often insufﬁcient to make up for
the signiﬁcant transition costs. Furthermore, users also
favor passwords. A recent survey on 1,119 US users [49]
showed that 58% of the participants prefer passwords
as their online login credentials, while only 16% prefer
biometrics, and 10% prefer other ways. Thus, passwords
are likely to persist in the foreseeable future.
Despite its ubiquity, password authentication is con-
fronted with a challenge [62]: truly random password-
s are difﬁcult for users to memorize, while easy-to-
remember passwords tend to be highly predictable. To
eliminate this notorious “security-usability” dilemma,
researchers have put a lot of effort [12,17,36,46,47] into
the following two types of studies.
