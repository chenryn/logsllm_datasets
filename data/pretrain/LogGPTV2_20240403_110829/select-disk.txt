Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the number of the disk to receive focus. You can view the numbers for all the disks on the computer by using the list disk command in DiskPart.NOTEWhen configuring systems with multiple disks, don't use select disk=0 to specify the system disk. The computer may reassign disk numbers when you reboot, and different computers with the same disk configuration can have different disk numbers.
Specifies the location of the disk to receive focus, for example, PCIROOT(0)#PCI(0F02)#atA(C00T00L00). To view the location path of a disk, select it and then type detail disk.
system
On BIOS computers, this option specifies that disk 0 receives focus. On EFI computers, the disk containing the EFI system partition (ESP), used for the current boot, receives focus. On EFI computers, the command will fail if there's no ESP, if there's more than one ESP, or if the computer is booted from Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).
next
After a disk is selected, this option iterates over all disks in the disk list. When you run this option, the next disk in the list receives focus.
NOTEWhen configuring systems with multiple disks, don't use select disk=0 to specify the system disk. The computer may reassign disk numbers when you reboot, and different computers with the same disk configuration can have different disk numbers.
PCIROOT(0)#PCI(0F02)#atA(C00T00L00)
