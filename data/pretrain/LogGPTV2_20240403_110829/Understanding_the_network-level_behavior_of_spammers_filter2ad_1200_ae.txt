# Withdrawal and Short-Lived BGP Route Announcements

## Introduction
This section discusses the observation of short-lived BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) route announcements, which are often used for spamming. The text provides detailed insights into the patterns and behaviors of spammers using this technique, known as "spectrum agility."

## Observations
Figure 10 illustrates the observation of a short-lived BGP route announcement for the IP prefix `82.0.0.0/8`, followed by spam arriving from mail relays in that prefix, and the subsequent withdrawal of that prefix.

### Key Patterns Observed
- **AS 21562**: An ISP in Indianapolis, Indiana, originated routing announcements for `66.0.0.0/8`.
- **AS 8717**: An ISP in Sofia, Bulgaria, originated announcements for `82.0.0.0/8`.
- **AS 4678**: An ISP in Japan, Canon Network Communications, originated routing announcements for `61.0.0.0/8`.

These observations were surprising due to the large size of the prefixes involved in short-lived BGP routing announcements. Although some short-lived routing announcements may be due to misconfigurations, the continuous appearance of these announcements, their large address blocks, and their coincidence with spam arrivals raised suspicions about their legitimacy.

## Spectrum Agility
### Definition
Spectrum agility is a technique where spammers:
1. Advertise (hijack) large blocks of IP address space (e.g., `/8`).
2. Send spam from IP addresses scattered throughout that space.
3. Withdraw the route for the IP address space shortly after sending the spam.

### Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Allows spammers to use a wide variety of IP addresses within a large block.
- **Evasion**: Helps evade IP-based filtering techniques like DNSBLs (DNS Blacklists).

### Additional Features
- **IP Address Distribution**: Mail relays sending spam have widely distributed IP addresses.
- **Single Use**: IP addresses typically appear only once.
- **Reachability**: Many hosts were not reachable by traceroute.
- **Unannounced Space**: Many IP addresses were in allocated but unannounced and unused IP address space.
- **Forged AS Paths**: Some AS paths contained reserved (unallocated) AS numbers, suggesting an attempt to hamper traceability.

## Prevalence of BGP Spectrum Agility
### Data Analysis
- **Long-Term Continuity**: Almost 99% of BGP routing announcements were announced continuously for at least a day.
- **Intermittent Use**: During periods of high activity, up to 10% of received spam coincided with routing announcements lasting less than a day.

### Findings
- **Finding 6.1 (Spectrum Agility)**: A small, persistent group of spammers use spectrum agility to send spam.
- **Finding 6.2 (Prevalence: Spam from Short-Lived Routes)**: Only about 1% of spam was from routes that persisted for less than a day, but during peak times, this could rise to 10%.

## How Much Spam from Spectrum Agility?
- **Small Fraction**: A small fraction of spam originates from IP addresses corresponding to short-lived BGP route announcements.
- **Volume Comparison**: No more than 10%, and more likely as little as 1%, of all spam is sent using this technique.
- **Persistent vs. Voluminous Spammers**: The most persistent spammers using this technique are not necessarily the ones sending the most spam.

### Finding
- **Finding 6.3 (Persistence vs. Volume)**: The ASes where spammers most continually use short-lived route announcements are not the same ASes from which the most spam originates via this technique.

## Lessons for Better Spam Mitigation
### Key Lessons
1. **Host Identity**: Better notions of host identity are needed, as current methods are foiled by short-lived bots and spectrum agility.
2. **Aggregate Behavior**: Detection techniques based on aggregate behavior are more effective than single IP address observations.
3. **Routing Infrastructure Security**: Securing the Internet routing infrastructure is crucial to bolster identity and traceability of email senders.
4. **Network-Level Properties**: Incorporating network-level properties into spam filters can be highly effective at detecting spam missed by other techniques.

## Conclusion
The study highlights the need for better spam mitigation techniques that leverage network-level properties. The analysis of BGP spectrum agility and its implications for spam detection and prevention provides valuable insights for future spam filter design.
