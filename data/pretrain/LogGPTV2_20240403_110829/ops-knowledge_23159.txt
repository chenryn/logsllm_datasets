Question: In the context of biometric authentication systems, how does testing across diverse subject demographics impact the system's performance, and why is it crucial to calibrate presentation attacks accordingly?
"A": "It reveals potential performance disparities across different genders, age groups, and races/ethnicities, which is critical for ensuring the system's reliability and inclusivity.",
"B": "It allows the system to focus on a narrower set of biometric data, making it more efficient but less accurate for a global population.",
"C": "It reduces the necessity for machine learning algorithms in authentication, leading to a more deterministic and predictable system behavior.",
"D": "It guarantees that the system will perform uniformly across all demographics, eliminating the need for calibration of presentation attacks."
Answer: A
