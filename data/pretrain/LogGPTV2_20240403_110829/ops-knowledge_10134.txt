User: I used brew to install port audio.
I then tried pip install pyaudio.
I get:
error: $MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET mismatch: now "10.9" but "10.11" during configure
How can I set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET so that I don't get this error?
Assistant: You can try export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET='desired value' in Terminal just before you run the installation process.
