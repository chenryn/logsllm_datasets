Hello -
I have been using the bootstrap customization tool
(getbootstrap.com/customize/) a lot over the past week and it has been an
invaluable timesaver.
It would be great if the tool saved the customization ID in the comments at
the top of the generated CSS file. This way I could load up my build weeks or
months later and quickly make any needed tweaks. Just a thought :)
Thanks for the great development tools!
