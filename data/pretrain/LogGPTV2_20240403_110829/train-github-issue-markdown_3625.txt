Subject: Suggestion for Improvement - Bootstrap Customization Tool

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. Over the past week, I have been extensively using the Bootstrap customization tool available at getbootstrap.com/customize/. It has proven to be an invaluable time-saver in my development process.

To further enhance the usability of this excellent tool, I would like to suggest a minor but potentially very helpful improvement. It would be greatly beneficial if the generated CSS file could include the customization ID in the comment section at the top. This addition would allow me (and other users) to easily reload our specific builds weeks or even months later, facilitating any necessary adjustments without having to go through the entire customization process again.

Thank you for providing such robust and user-friendly development tools. Your continued support and innovation are much appreciated.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
