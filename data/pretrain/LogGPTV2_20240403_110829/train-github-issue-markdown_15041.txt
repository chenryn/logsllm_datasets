**Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
Hello everyone,
this is the first of two tickets I'm going to open regarding the polymorphic
map, which I consider a very neat feature of SA. I haven't found much
documentation on it though, so I'm not sure whether these are features or bugs
- I'd guess the latter.
The polymorphic map, as I understand it, is an alternative to the default
polymorphic_identity system and f.e. suitable for setups where you would
dynamically decide which class to map to.
In that case you shouldn't have to set a polymorphic identity in your
polymorphic classes. This, however, seems to be necessary for inserting
objects into the database, as the discriminator otherwise would be inserted as
NULL.
I have attached a test to demonstrate this.
Best Regards,  
Thomas Wiebe
