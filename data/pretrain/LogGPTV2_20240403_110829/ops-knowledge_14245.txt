User: I currently have a working python application, gui with wxpython. I send this application a folder which then gets processed by a command line application via Popen. Each time I run this application it take about 40 mins+ to process before it finishes. While a single job processes I would like to queue up another job, I don't want to submit multiple jobs at the same time, I want to submit one job, while it's processing I want to submit another job, so when the first one finishes it would then just process the next, and so on, but I am unsure of how to go about this and would appreciate some suggestions.
Assistant: Use subprocess.call()  instead of Popen, or use Popen.wait().
