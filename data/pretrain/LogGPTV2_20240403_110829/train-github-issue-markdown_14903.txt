**Current behavior**  
Having several times an element in the DOM tree with the selector associated
to a component will only bootstrap the first DOM node found in the tree.
**Expected behavior**  
All nodes matching the correct selector should be bootstrapped not only the
first appearance in the tree.
**Reproduction of the problem**

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I need to bootstrap several time the same component on my page.  
(For my special case I am bootstrapping 2 time the same ui-element that are at
2 different places in the DOM tree)
