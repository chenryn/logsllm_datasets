User: I am a new python user. I need to run scripts written by (remote) coworkers.
My first install of Python is 3.5.0.rc1.  It was installed on a Windows 10 machine using the python webinstaller.
On installation, I told the installer to add all Python components, and to add Python to the PATH.  I authorized python for all users.
I can load and access Python through the command line.  It will respond to basic instructions (>>> 1+1   2).
However, I do not get the expected response from some basic commands (eg, >>>import os followed by >>>print os.getcwd() results in a syntax error rather than in a print of the directory containing the python executable). 
Further, I can not get python to execute scripts (eg. >>>python test.py).  This results in a syntax error, which seems to point to various places in the script file name.  I have tried a quick search of previous questions on StackOverfow, and can't seem to find discussion of what seems to be a failure on this basic of level.  
Perhaps I have not loaded all the necessary python modules, or is it something else that I'm missing
Assistant: in python3 print is replaced by print() you can use this
