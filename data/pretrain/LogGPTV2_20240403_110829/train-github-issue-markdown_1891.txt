A checkbox is checked if one clicks on the white space to the right from its
label. We have checkboxes that control billing stuff and people are being
charged by mistake because of this issue.
The issue appears in all browsers.  
Is there a way to fix it in the library? If not - is there a simple workaround
for this?
Thank you.
