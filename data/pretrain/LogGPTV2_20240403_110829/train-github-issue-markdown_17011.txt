Geometries having Face4's with MeshFaceMaterial assigned will throw a "map
error" after merging vertices with Geometry.mergeVertices.
Reason is obvious: mergeVertices triangulates the Face4 to two Face3's but
doesn't copy over Face4.materialIndex.
So after mergeVertices the geometry contains Face3's without
Face3.materialIndex set.  
Then of course MeshFaceMaterial can't find its material.
