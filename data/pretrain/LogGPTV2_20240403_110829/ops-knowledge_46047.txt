User: Please briefly introduce the architectural patterns of web applications, as well as common web frameworks and their characteristics
Assistant: The Web application architecture pattern refers to a software design pattern based on layered thinking, in which applications are divided into different layers, and each layer is responsible for completing specific tasks. Common web application architecture patterns include: 1. MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller): divide the application into three parts, Model is responsible for processing data, View is responsible for displaying data, and Controller is responsible for connecting the two. 2. Lightweight web application framework (Microframework): usually consists of a small number of core components and libraries, including only the most basic web application functions. 3. RESTful API architecture pattern: It is a method of designing web application API, based on HTTP protocol, centered on resources, adopting simple and standard URL structure and HTTP method, easy to develop and maintain. Common web frameworks are: 1. Flask: It is a lightweight Python web framework with simple and flexible functions. 2. Django: It is a heavyweight Python web framework with powerful functions that provides a complete web application framework. 3. Ruby on Rails: It is a Ruby Web framework based on the MVC model, with fast speed and high development efficiency. 4. Express: It is a web application framework based on the Node.js platform, which provides an easy-to-use API and plug-in system, and is easy to expand.
