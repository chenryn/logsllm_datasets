In the subject line function, log probability is calculated as follows (lines
287-88):
    proba[proba <= 0] = 1e-5
    log_proba = np.log(proba)
Oftentimes one encounters probabilities significantly smaller than 1.0e-5 that
are still nonzero. In the current implementation, for example, the log prob of
1.0e-6 will actually evaluate higher than log prob of 0.0. It seems to me that
a better implementation of this would be a floor-like function as follows:
    proba[proba < 1e-9] = 1.e-9
