### Description
`apache-airflow-providers-google` has a lot of dependencies, some pinned to
pretty old versions compared to current release versions. In particular, many
of these older versions requires `protobuf=1.15.0, but you have google-cloud-bigquery 3.7.0 which is incompatible.
    google-ads 18.0.0 requires protobuf!=3.18.*,!=3.19.*,=3.12.0, but you have protobuf 3.20.3 which is incompatible.
