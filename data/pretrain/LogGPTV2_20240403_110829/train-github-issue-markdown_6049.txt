It would be beneficial to include information on using Python 3's `venv` virtual environment in the Flask documentation, specifically in the section found at [http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/mod_wsgi/](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/mod_wsgi/) and its corresponding `.rst` file (`flask/docs/deploying/mod_wsgi.rst`).

For deploying with `venv`, the necessary details can be found here: [https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/virtual-environments.html](https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/virtual-environments.html). Essentially, there is no need to include `activate_this`-related code within the `.wsgi` file. Instead, you should add the following line to your Apache (httpd) configuration:

```apache
WSGIDaemonProcess myapp python-home=/usr/local/venvs/myapp
```

If you agree that this addition would be valuable, I can prepare a draft for merging. Otherwise, please consider this as a reference point.
