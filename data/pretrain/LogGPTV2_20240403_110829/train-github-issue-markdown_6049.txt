It would be nice if http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/mod_wsgi/ and
hence `flask/docs/deploying/mod_wsgi.rst` sported some information on Python
3's venv virtual environment:
The information needed to deploy with `venv`is available here:
https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/virtual-
environments.html
Basically no `activate_this`-code is needed in the .wsgi file, just
`WSGIDaemonProcess myapp python-home=/usr/local/venvs/myapp` in your
httpd/apache config.
I'll draft something to merge if you think it is a good idea, otherwise this
will have to serve as reference.
