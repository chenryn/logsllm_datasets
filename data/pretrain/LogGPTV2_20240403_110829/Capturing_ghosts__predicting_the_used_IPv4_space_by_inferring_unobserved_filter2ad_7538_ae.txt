tion preﬁx sizes. We also investigate growth on a longer time scale
and whether our estimates are sensible given the reported growth
of Internet users.
6.1 Deﬁnitions
In most ﬁgures we plot one or more of the following metrics:
• Routed IPv4 addresses and /24 networks: the total number
of addresses/networks that were publicly routed based on
Figure 4 shows the number of estimated used /24 subnets against
the number of observed and routed /24 subnets both as absolute
numbers and normalised. The dashed line is the actual estimates
and the solid line is the estimates smoothed. The total number of
observed /24 increased from 4.8 million to 5.9 million, but we es-
timate that the number of /24 subnets actually increased from 5.1
million to over 6.2 million (an increase of 0.45 million subnets per
year). The estimate range is narrow, the minimum and maximum
are within ±1% of the point estimates. Whilst the routed space
only increased by 7% in two years, the number of observed and
estimated used /24 subnets increased by 22% over the same time.

Figure 5: Absolute and relative growth of estimated, observed and routed IPv4 addresses
absolute numbers and normalised. The number of observed IPv4
addresses increased from 450 million to 740 million, but we esti-
mate that the number of addresses actually increased from 720 mil-
lion to 1.2 billion (an average increase of about 170 million IPv4
addresses per year). Minimum and maximum of the estimate range
are within ±3% of the point estimate. As for /24 subnets, the ob-
served and estimated number of IPv4 addresses increased faster
than the routed addresses. The diﬀerence between estimated and
observed relative growth may be in part because of earlier under-
counting due to fewer sources and a gap in the GAME data collec-
tion.
The number of estimated /24 networks is only 5–10% above the
number of observed /24 networks, whereas the number of estimated
IPs is 50–60% above the number of observed IPs. Intuitively this
makes sense, since a /24 network is observed if any of its addresses
if observed. The relatively small error for /24s means one could
treat the number of observed /24s as relatively good approximation
of the number of actually used /24s.
6.4 Used IPv4 space by RIR
Figure 6 shows the estimated number of IPv4 addresses over
time depending on the RIR responsible for their allocation both
as absolute numbers and normalised. For brevity we omitted the
broadly similar statistics for /24 subnets. APNIC has the largest
number of used addresses followed by RIPE and ARIN. Looking
at relative growth, AfriNIC is growing at the fastest rate, followed
by LACNIC. Of the three RIRs with the most allocated space, rel-
atively APNIC and ARIN are growing faster than RIPE.
6.5 Used IPv4 space by preﬁx size
Figure 7 shows the average yearly growth rate for addresses for
diﬀerent preﬁx sizes (based on the RIR allocation data). For brevity
we do not show the estimates for /24 networks here, as the trends
are broadly similar. Absolute growth is strongest in the large pre-
ﬁxes /10 to /16 (/8 and /9 have not grown much). However, if
we look at relative growth, growth has been more equally across
many preﬁxes. Exceptions are the old /8 allocations which have
not grown and /9, /21 and /22 allocations which show the strongest
growth (/9 is driven up by a few ISPs since there are less than ten
/9 allocations overall, and /22 is the largest allocation handed out
by APNIC since 15 April, 2011, and by RIPE since 14 Sep, 2012).
6.6 Used IPv4 space by allocation age
Figure 8 shows the average yearly growth rate of IPv4 addresses
for diﬀerent allocation ages (based on RIR allocation data) until the
end of 2013. For brevity we omitted the results for /24 subnets as
the trend is broadly similar. In absolute numbers the more recent
allocations made since 2005 are growing the most, with a clear pos-
itive correlation between recentness and growth. In relative terms
growth is strongest for allocations made in the last three years, but
we can also see 20% or higher growth in some old allocations.

6.7 Used IPv4 space by country
Figure 9 shows the absolute and relative growth for IPv4 ad-
dresses for the countries with the largest number of observed used
IPv4 addresses (at least 1.5 million addresses). Again, we do not
show results for /24 subnets as the trends are broadly similar. Ab-
solute growth is strongest in the two nations with the largest allo-
cations (USA, China) followed by Brazil and South Korea. Rela-
tive growth is between 10% and 30% for many countries, but Ro-
mania and several Asian and South American countries (Brazil,
Columbia, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Argentina, Thailand, Tai-
wan, and China) have grown faster.
6.8 Long-term growth
Figure 10 shows the number of allocated addresses since 2003
(from RIR data), routed and allocated addresses since 2008 (from
RV) and the number of pingable, observed and estimated addresses
over time for our 12-month time windows. The ping data from
2003 to 2011 is from USC/LANDER [3]. The ping data since 2012
is the 12-months windows of IPING. Note that allocated and routed
addresses are plotted on a diﬀerent scale (right y-axis).
Two distinct phases are visible for the number of allocated ad-
dresses: the last boom 2004–2011, and the slowdown due to run-
ning out of unallocated addresses since 2011. The number of allo-
cated addresses increased much faster than the number of pingable
addresses until 2011. Even since 2011 the number of allocated
addresses increased faster than the number of pingable addresses.
On the other hand, the number of estimated used addresses is in-
creasing much faster than the number of pingable addresses with a
growth rate similar to the rate of the allocated and routed addresses
before their slowdown in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
6.9 Comparison with Internet user growth
We think the growth of the number of used IPv4 addresses is pri-
marily driven by an Internet user population increase, irrespective
of the number of devices per user. All home devices are behind
NATs and mobile devices are also largely behind NATs. Similarly,
if we look at increasingly complex commercial networks, these are
also mainly behind NATs (or not even connected to the Internet).
In this section we derive a very rough estimate of the IPv4 address
growth based on the Internet user growth and compare it with the
growth estimated with CR.
According to data from the ITU [27] the number of Internet
users has grown from 16 million in December 1995 to 2.75 bil-
lion (roughly 39% of the world’s population) in December 2013 as
shown in Figure 11. The growth rate of Internet users looks expo-
nential at the beginning of the graph, however since 2006/2007 the
growth appears roughly linear. This is consistent with the roughly
linear trend in our results shown in Section 6.3.
Between 2007 and 2012 the number of Internet users grew by
roughly 250 million per year (c.f. Figure 11). For private use typ-

ically a household shares one public IP address. In industrial na-
tions the household size is 2–3, but in developing countries it can
be higher, for example it is over 5 in India [28]. We assume the
average household size of new Internet users is between 2 and 5.
In addition a fraction of new users will get a public IPv4 address
at work. We assume an average employment ratio of 65% [29].
We could not ﬁnd any data on the number of average public IP
addresses used per employee, so we are assuming a wide possible
range. As upper limit we assume on average one IPv4 address per
two employees, as in reality many employees (especially in devel-
oping countries) have no Internet at work, work at home, or share
computers with other workers. As a lower limit we assume on av-
erage there is one public address per 200 workers.
Let gU be the user growth per year, H the average household
size, pE the employment ratio, and W the average number of em-
ployees sharing an IP at work. Then the IP address growth is
gI = (1/H + pE/W) gU. Based on the above ranges of H and W,
we would expect the IPv4 addresses to grow between 50 million
and 205 million per year (plus additional addresses for service and
infrastructure growth). Our CR growth estimate from Section 6.3 is
170 million IPv4 addresses per year, which ﬁts within this range.
7. UNUSED SPACE PREDICTION
Our CR technique tells us how many unobserved IPv4 ad-
dresses to expect, but says nothing about the distribution of free
blocks/preﬁxes. This is a challenging issue – recipients of newly
assigned IPv4 address blocks typically prefer usably-sized contigu-
ous allocations, and forwarding information base (FIB) tables in
routers are more eﬃciently packed if address blocks are allocated
hierarchically.
Some information is given by the CR estimate of the used but
unobserved /24 networks (in Figure 4). However, this again does
not tell us whether these small blocks are isolated or parts of un-
used larger blocks. In this section, we try to understand how the
unseen addresses are distributed among seemingly empty subnets,
by observing what happens when data sources are combined se-
quentially; each new source brings addresses that were unseen by
the previous sources, and we can model how those addresses ﬁll
the previously empty space.
7.1 Model
Let xi be the number of observed free /i blocks. Let Z00...0 be the
total number of new addresses to allocate (given by CR). Let Ni
be the number of new addresses assumed to be allocated to vacant
/i blocks, assuming sequential allocation. Speciﬁcally, if two ad-

new address is allocated to a free /i block is proportional to xi, the
number of such free blocks. In particular, it assumes that there are

remains approximately constant as more batches of addresses are
discovered.
The model includes subnets larger than /8, even though blocks
larger than /8 have not been allocated. Similarly, we consider all
vacant subnets down to vacant /32s, even though subnets smaller
than a /24 are not routed on the public Internet. However, before
computing the remaining unused preﬁxes we split a few /7 into
/8, and we also exclude all private, multicast, experimental and re-
served preﬁxes, such as 224.0.0.0/3 or 10.0.0.0/8. Note that we do
not exclude non-publicly routed preﬁxes.
To determine how the unobserved addresses predicted by CR
will aﬀect the distribution of free blocks, it remains to determine
fi. To do this, we observe the change in x when a new data set ∆
is added to an existing list S of used IPv4 addresses, and from that
calculate n. Since A in (3) is invertible, (2) gives
nS ,∆ = A−1(xS∪∆ − xS ).
The fi are then found by (4), normalized so that f32 = 1. Since few
large subnets become newly used for each data set, estimates of fi
for i (cid:46) 12 are noisy. This is unfortunate, since these are the blocks
of greatest interest. To reduce this noise, estimates were averaged
over four cases: ∆ = IPING, GAME, WEB, WIKI; in each case, S
is the union of all remaining datasets, except SWIN and CALT.
One concern with this model is that, as the address space ﬁlls
up, the values of fi may vary. To check this, we performed tests
where datasets were added to S one at a time, in both increasing and
decreasing order of the dataset size. The values were reasonably
consistent in each case.
7.2 Results
Figure 12 shows the number of addresses in unused preﬁxes at 30
June 2014, based on all sources except SWIN and CALT. Results
are for both direct observation and CR. The majority of empty pre-
ﬁxes are longer than /20 (fewer than 212 addresses), but the unused
space is roughly uniformly distributed among preﬁxes of lengths /9
to /24 (except /15 and /16). The reason for this is unclear.
If the used but unobserved /8 to /24 subnets estimated by the
model of Section 7.1 were divided into /24s, there would be 0.3

dresses are added to the same vacant /i, then only the ﬁrst of these
contributes to Ni , since the block is no longer vacant when the
second one is added.
Similarly, let xS
i be the number of free /i blocks in a set S of
addresses, ZS ,∆
00...0 be the number of new addresses when a new set
∆ is merged with S , and nS ,∆
be the number of addresses added to
vacant /i blocks in the process. Without the subscript i, the variables
x and n denote vectors.
Note that adding an address to a vacant /i will reduce the number
of vacant /i blocks by 1, but increase by one the number of / j blocks
for each j > i, regardless of where within the /i the address is added.

A natural approach is to estimate the previous fraction of ad-
dresses revealed by each new source that have been allocated to
free blocks of a given size, and assume the new Z0,0,...,0 addresses
will be distributed in the same way. This is not suﬃcient, because
