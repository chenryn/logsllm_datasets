User: Please describe the principle and implementation of virtualization technology
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a technology that divides physical computer resources into multiple virtual environments. Its core principle is to virtualize computer hardware through virtualization software (also called Hypervisor), thereby dividing a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each of which can run different operating systems, applications and services. There are mainly the following ways to implement virtualization technology: 1. Full virtualization: Full virtualization is to virtualize the entire computer hardware resources. , hard disk, network and other resources are allocated to the virtual machine. A virtual machine can be regarded as a completely independent computer system that runs in a virtual environment isolated from a physical computer, and it can have its own operating system, applications and data. In full virtualization, neither the virtual machine's operating system nor the applications require any changes. 2. Paravirtualization: Paravirtualization is to install a special operating system on a physical computer, called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), which can communicate and manage with virtual machines. Unlike full virtualization, paravirtualization requires modifications to the operating system kernel in order to run in a virtualized environment. In paravirtualization, the virtual machine uses the modified kernel of the operating system, which can interact with the VMM to realize resource sharing and management between the virtual machine and the physical computer. Compared with full virtualization, paravirtualization reduces the dependence on the operating system. 3. Container virtualization (lightweight virtualization): Container virtualization isolates applications and their dependent operating environments in one container, and each container shares an operating system. Each container allows the use of a specific version of the operating system, and applications are only deployed in units of containers without modifying the operating system or other settings. Compared with full virtualization, container virtualization is lighter, runs faster and saves resources, but the corresponding security will also be reduced. Virtualization technology can make full use of computer resources and improve computer utilization and system flexibility by running multiple virtualization environments on one physical computer. Virtualization technology has been widely used in server, network, storage, desktop, mobile devices and other fields.
