ABSTRACT
Crypto Phones aim to establish end-to-end secure voice (and text)
communications based on human-centric (usually) short checksum
validation. They require end users to perform: (1) checksum com-
parison to detect traditional data-based man-in-the-middle (data
MITM) attacks, and, optionally, (2) speaker verification to detect
sophisticated voice-based man-in-the-middle (voice MITM) attacks.
However, research shows that both tasks are prone to human er-
rors making Crypto Phones highly vulnerable to MITM attacks,
especially to data MITM given the prominence of these attacks.
Further, human errors under benign settings undermine usability
since legitimate calls would often need to be rejected.
We introduce Closed Captioning Crypto Phones (CCCP), that re-
move the human user from the loop of checksum comparison by
utilizing speech transcription. CCCP simply requires the user to an-
nounce the checksum to the other party—the system automatically
transcribes the spoken checksum and performs the comparison. Au-
tomating checksum comparisons offers many key advantages over
traditional designs: (1) the chances of data MITM due to human er-
rors and “click-through” could be highly reduced (even eliminated);
(2) longer checksums can be utilized, which increases the protocol
security against data MITM; (3) users’ cognitive burden is reduced
due to the need to perform only a single task, thereby lowering the
potential of human errors.
As a main component of CCCP, we first design and implement
an automated checksum comparison tool based on standard Speech
to Text engines. To evaluate the security and usability benefits of
CCCP, we then design and conduct an online user study that mimics
a realistic VoIP scenario, and collect and transcribe a comprehensive
data set spoken by a wide variety of speakers in real-life conditions.
Our study results demonstrate that, by using our automated check-
sum comparison, CCCP can completely resist data MITM, while
significantly reducing human errors in the benign case compared
to the traditional approach. They also show that CCCP may help
reduce the likelihood of voice MITM. Finally, we discuss how CCCP
can be improved by designing specialized transcribers and carefully
selected checksum dictionaries, and how it can be integrated with
existing Crypto Phones to bolster their security and usability.

1 INTRODUCTION
Online voice, video and text communications (VoIP) is one of the
most dominant means of real-time communication deployed today.
This popularity is exemplified by a plethora of VoIP applications,
such as Skype, Viber, WhatsApp or FaceTime, enjoying a burgeon-
ing user base. In contrast to traditional telephony networks, VoIP
communication may be more easily susceptible to various forms
of attacks, including eavesdropping [3, 4] and man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attacks [2, 63]. Governments, intelligence agencies, private
organizations, and cyber criminals, often monitor VoIP calls [15],
for criminal investigation, political or military endeavors [1], and
theft of sensitive information [20]. Considering these vulnerabil-
ities, a fundamental security task is to protect, that is, encrypt as
well as authenticate all VoIP sessions. Ideally, this objective should
be achieved without relying on third-parties (e.g., an online server)
or a centralized infrastructure (e.g., PKI) because such centralized
services may themselves get compromised, be malicious or under
coercion of law enforcement authorities.
Crypto Phones, such as Zfone [33], Silent Circle [28], and Signal
[24] are mobile, PC or web-based VoIP applications that aim to
offer end-to-end VoIP security guarantees based on a decentral-
ized, human-centric mechanism. Crypto Phones seem to be in high
demand in both commercial and personal domains [25]. Promi-
nent mobile apps, WhatsApp and Viber, have also started to offer a
similar end-to-end security feature [36, 37].
In order to secure the voice, video or even text communications,
Crypto Phones require a cryptographic key, which is agreed upon
by the end parties using a specialized key exchange protocol (e.g.,
[40, 62]). This protocol produces a usually short (e.g., 16-bit or
2-word) checksum, called a Short Authenticated String (SAS), per
each communicating party, with the characteristic that if an MITM
attacker attempts to interfere with the protocol, the checksums will
not match.
To ensure that the MITM attacker does not interfere with the
protocol messages and compromise the protocol security (over the
data/voice channel), Crypto Phones rely upon the end users to
perform the following tasks (Figure 1 visualizes the benign setting):
• Checksum Comparison (required): Verbally communicating
and matching checksums displayed on each user’s device. This

task is needed to defeat data MITM, an MITM attack over the
data/IP channel.
• Speaker Verification (optional): Ascertaining that the voice
announcing the checksum is the voice of the legitimate user at
the other end of the call. This task may be needed to defeat voice
MITM, an MITM attack over the human voice communications.
The checksum comparison task is crucial and mandatory given
that data MITM is a prominent and commonly occurring attack
in real-world [19, 30]. The speaker verification task may be op-
tional (like in many traditional designs of Crypto Phones) since
voice MITM is considered a more sophisticated attack (Crypto
Phones attack hierarchy is depicted in Figure 5). Unfortunately, in
practice, the human errors in executing the checksum verification
and/or speaker verification tasks may adversely affect the secu-
rity of Crypto Phones. Specifically, failure to detect mismatching
checksums or imitated voices (different speakers’ or synthesized
voices) would result in a compromise of Crypto Phones session
communications (eavesdropping over voice communications and
MITM over text communications).
Indeed, recent research [58, 59] emphasizes such human errors
demonstrating that current designs of Crypto Phones are highly
vulnerable to both data and voice MITM attacks. Moreover, due
to these dual-task human errors (in case both tasks are required),
the security level provided by Crypto Phones protocol actually
degrades with the use of longer checksums, contrary to the theoret-
ical guarantees provided by the protocol (which limits the MITM
attack success probability to 2−k for a k-bit SAS checksum). These
above tasks may also be susceptible to a “click-through” (or skip-
through), i.e., the user just accepting without paying attention or
duly performing the task, as observed in prior device pairing [49]
and security warnings research [41]. Furthermore, the human er-
rors in the benign case, i.e., rejection of matching checksums or
legitimate users’ voices, adversely affect the usability of the systems
since legitimate calls may often be rejected (and then need to be
re-established).
In this paper, we set out to address some of these fundamental
problems facing traditional Crypto Phones designs, especially fo-
cusing on threat model involving data MITM attacker. We introduce
Closed Captioning Crypto Phones (CCCP), a novel Crypto Phones
design that removes the human user from the loop of the checksum
comparison task by utilizing speech transcription. CCCP requires
the user to simply announce the checksum to the other party, and
the system automatically transcribes the announced checksum and
performs the comparison on behalf of the user (Figure 2). Automat-
ing the checksum comparison task in CCCP provides several key
advantages over the traditional approach:
(1) The success probability of data MITM, due to human errors
or click-through behavior in checksum comparison, could be
highly reduced (or even eliminated).
(2) Longer checksums can be optionally utilized, which increase
the underlying protocol security against data MITM.
(3) The overall checksum validation task becomes more reliable
since the user only needs to perform a single task which reduces
the cognitive burden [46, 47].
Our Contributions: We believe that our work provides the fol-
lowing contributions to the domain of end-to-end secure commu-
nications:
(1) A Novel Crypto Phones Checksum Validation Design: We
propose CCCP, a novel Crypto Phones checksum validation
methodology based on a simple yet effective idea of automated
speech transcription, which can be seamlessly applied to any
Crypto Phones protocol and reduce the chances of MITM at-
tacks (especially data MITM) arising from human errors or
click-through in the mandatory checksum comparison task,
thereby considerably improving the security and usability of
the current Crypto Phones design.
Transcription is now considered a mature technology [22, 31],
used reliably in many real-life domains, and is, therefore, an
excellent candidate to automate the checksum comparison task
in Crypto Phones without much added cost. Although transcrip-
tion may not by itself be fully error-free [18, 27, 38, 55], we show
how it can be carefully used to yield a robust automated check-
sum comparison tool as part of our CCCP system. We design and
implement this tool based on standard transcription engines,
including Google Speech API [17], Apple Mac Dictation [35]
and IBM Watson Speech to Text Service.
