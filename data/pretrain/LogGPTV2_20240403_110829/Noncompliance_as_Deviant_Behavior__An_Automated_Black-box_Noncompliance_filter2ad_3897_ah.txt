## Network Procedures

### NAS Layer Procedures
In Figure 7, the NAS layer procedures are shown in black.

#### Initial Attach
1. **Radio Setup**: After rebooting, the User Equipment (UE) performs a radio setup procedure.
2. **RRC Connection Setup**: The UE establishes communication through the RRC layer following the RRC Connection Setup.
3. **Attach Request**: The UE starts the NAS attach procedure by sending the `attach_request` message.
4. **Authentication**: Successful authentication is performed through `auth_request` and `auth_response` messages.
5. **Security Mode Command**: The MME negotiates ciphering and integrity algorithms with the UE using the `security_mode_command` procedure.
6. **NAS Security Context**: The NAS level security context is established between the UE and MME, and the selected encryption and integrity protection algorithms will be applied to subsequent NAS messages.
7. **Attach Accept**: The MME concludes the attach procedure by sending an `attach_accept` message with a Globally Unique Temporary Identity (GUTI). The UE responds with an `attach_complete` message.
8. **Attach Reject**: If the attach cannot be accepted by the network, the MME sends an `attach_reject` message to the UE, including an appropriate cause value.

#### Other NAS Procedures
- **Identification Procedure**: Used to determine the identity of the device, typically the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI).
- **GUTI Reallocation**: The MME reallocates a new GUTI to the UE by sending a `GUTI_reallocation` message. The UE acknowledges with a `GUTI_reallocation_complete`.
- **Tracking Area Update**: This standalone procedure occurs when the UE detects a new tracking area (TA) or a periodic TA update timer has expired.
- **Downlink NAS Transport**: The network can use this procedure to send an SMS message in the NAS message.

### RRC Layer Procedures
In Figure 7, the RRC layer procedures are shown in blue.

#### RRC Setup
- **Purpose**: Establish an RRC connection and transfer the initial NAS dedicated information message from the UE to the network.

#### RRC Security Activation
- **Procedure**: Established through the `RRC_security_mode_command` message from the eNodeB and completed by the `RRC_security_mode_complete` message from the UE.

#### RRC Release
- **Purpose**: The network releases the established radio bearers and all radio resources to suspend the RRC connection.

#### RRC Connection Reconfiguration
- **Purpose**: Modify an RRC connection, such as establishing, modifying, or releasing radio bearers.
- **Process**: The network sends an `RRC_reconfiguration` message, and the UE replies with `RRC_reconfiguration_complete`.

#### RRC Connection Re-establishment
- **Purpose**: A UE in RRC Connected state, for which security has been activated, may initiate this procedure to continue the RRC connection.
- **Process**: Initiated by the UE with `RRC_connection_reestablishment_request` and completed with `RRC_connection_reestablishment_complete` messages.

## Model Checker Performance in Equivalence Checking

### Analysis
For further analysis on the timing performance of the FSM equivalence checker, we calculate the time required for repeated queries and take the average of each round. The results are shown in Figure 8. After each round of queries, a new invariant is added to the model, reducing the search space. In cases with multiple traces for the same input and output pair, the model checker goes deeper into FSMs, requiring more time.

### Evaluation
To evaluate the timing performance of the FSM equivalence checker, we calculate the time required for all pairwise deviant checking five times and report the average, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation in Table 10. On average, it takes our FSM equivalence checker 42 minutes to find all deviations. The timing cost of repeated querying to the model checker is shown in Figure 8.

## Additional Discussion

### Parallelization
Parallelizing model learning by distributing different membership queries from a learner to different UEs is plausible but necessitates complex coordination for maintaining soundness and efficiency. This becomes challenging when inconsistencies are detected due to observational nondeterminism across different instances. In exceptional cases, such as a majority of the UE instances having their timers fire at the same time, it will take a long time to complete the learning because of the majority voting mechanism, potentially leading to a wrong result. Resolving this requires reverting the learning process, which may nullify the performance gain due to parallelization. These complex cases require further investigation and are left for future work.

### Input and Output Symbols
**Table 9: List of Input Symbols and Possible Output Symbols**

- **Input Symbols (After Irrelevant Message Pruning)**
- **Output Symbols (Λ)**

*Protected implies ¬is_plain_header(m), meaning the message is integrity protected and encrypted.
± Replay messages are only true for protected messages; plain text messages do not have sequence numbers and replay protection.

| Mean   | 35.975|
| Median | 41.84 |
| Standard Deviation | 21.3 |

### Deviant Behavior to Automatic Exploitation
DIKEUE automatically provides traces depicting deviant implementation-specific behavior. This is concrete evidence of either implementation deviating from specifications or the standards being underspecified or containing conflicting specifications. Currently, we manually construct attack strategies from these traces, which we plan to automate in the future.
