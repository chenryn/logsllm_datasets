A SECURE SKETCHES FOR SET DIFFERENCE
FROM [29]
For our multisketch construction, we use the secure sketch con-
struction for set-distance from [29]. We give a new (slightly less
efficient) construction for set-distance using authenticated encryp-
tion scheme (see Section 3). Here we give the original set-distance
construction given in [29] for reference purpose.
Let w and ˜w be two sets of size n. We also assume that there is a
one-to-one mapping between the set elements and Z2k , where 2k
is the size of the universe from where the set elements are chosen.
Set-distance is defined as d(w, ˜w) = w∆ ˜w = |w ∪ ˜w − w ∩ ˜w|. The
sketching function SS∆
t takes as input a set w and outputs a bit-
string s (a.k.a, the sketch of w). The recovery function Rec∆
t on
input s and a new set ˜w, outputs w if at least t out of n points match
between w and ˜w; that is to say | ˜w∆w| ≤ 2(n − t). The algorithms
for sketch and recover are shown in Figure 13.
According to the security analysis in [29], the conditional min-
entropy of the message distributions (uniform messages over Zn
2k )

given the sketch values is nk − 2(n − t)k = (2t − n)k. In our con-
struction, we used t = 7, n = 10, and therefore, the conditional
min-entropy will be at least 4k bits.
B DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF MULTISKETCH
OPERATIONS
A user registers with a user id u and a vector of biometric templates
w = w1 . . . wn. Multisketch uses two databases ℐ and ℱ, where
ℐ contains user id u and the corresponding helper data v, and ℱ
contains the random permutation of the templates registered so
far. Highlighted are the entries corresponding to a user u4 with
templates w4 = w41 . . . w4n.

C WVU DATA
One of the fingerprint dataset we used for evaluating the accuracy
of TenSketch is a subset of the dataset collected through ManTech
Innovations Fingerprint Study Phase I [25]. The fingerprints were
collected at West Virginia University and released at GMU. We call
this dataset WVU dataset. The database contains fingerprints of 500
people acquired using 7 optical sensors like CrossMatch Guardian,
I3 digID mini, CrossMatch Seek II as well as ink-based Tenprint
cards. Among the participants, most of the participant were in the
age group 20-33, accounting for 60.6% percent of people. Among
the ethnicity, Caucasians accounted for 57.2%.
Also, there were nearly equal number of male (51%) and female
(48%) participants. The users provided the two sets of fingerprints in
the sequence of rolled individual fingers on the right and left hands,
left slap, right slap, and thumb slap for the live sensor. In order to

carry out the experiments of this paper, for every subject we used
the fingerprint images of the ten fingers acquired using the I3 digID
Mini sensor. Every subject provided two sets of fingerprints each
of: rolled fingers on right and left hands, left slap, right slap, and
thumb slap. This data has been used in multiple prior work [48, 50].
D INFERENCE FROM FINGERPRINT
TEMPLATES.
We explore what information can be learned from the fingerprints
in xyt format (list of minutiae points). The template might reveal
some non-trivial information about the finger, such as which finger
it is, what is the NCIC class type, or the gender of the user, etc. This
information might lead to improved guessing strategy. For example,
an attacker can split the database of the fingerprint templates based
on the type of the finger.
We tried random forest [46] and multi-layer perceptron [12] to
determine each of the attributes: gender, class, finger position, NCIC
class type, scan type, and first or second scan (FS). We report the
result of our classifier in Figure 15. Notably, finger position and the
class of the fingerprint can be retrieved with significant accuracy
from the fingerprints (in xyt format).
E TRAINING ADVERSARIAL CLASSIFIERS
USING SIAMESE ARCHITECTURE
To construct adversarial classifiers, we tried both deep neural net-
work (DNN) and Siamese networks. In standard DNNs, the order
of input features does not carry any information. Therefore, both
fingerprint templates are concatenated and passed directly to a
DNN model. However, in Siamese networks [56, 58], we can en-
force the knowledge that the model is receiving two separate sets
of features and the goal is to infer some information (identifying if
they are from the same person, in our case) about these two sets.
Siamese architectures are first shown in [56, 58] to be useful for
face recognition and verification.
In Siamese networks, two input feature sets are passed to two sis-
ter networks with identical parameters (weights). (See Figure 8 for
a high-level diagram of the setup.) The job of two sister networks is
to transform the input features into an encoded vector of ne values,
v0 and v1. The two vectors are merged using a specific function, e.g.,
i =2ν
xi
i
Each solution of {xi}’s in the above equation is a valid classifier
combination, where xi denotes the number of times the classifier 𝒞i
is used in the sequence. In the previous example, 𝒞4 is used twice,
therefore x4 = 2 and all other xi = 0. If we assume the classifiers’
performances are independent, the effective FPR of the stitched

classifier would be Πt
Therefore, for any combination of classifiers, the total number of
t-tuples that need to be checked through MRec is N t−b · Πt
=
𝒪(N t−b). A stitched classifier with a long combination of classifiers
— high value of xi — might have lower FPR, for example, x2 = 6.
However, a long combination of classifiers will also degrade the true
positive rate of the stitched classifier; the attacker might not find
the correct tuple at the end due to one of the classifiers misclassified
it. We therefore adjust the classifiers to have a true positive rate
(TPR) of 0.9 or more.
We empirically compute the FPR of the stitched classifiers for
all possible combinations. There are only 11 possible solutions to
the above equation for b = 1 and t = 7. We found x7 = 1 has the
least FPR, 0.1, and x2 = 6 has the second lowest FPR. In Section 7
we give different attacks using 𝒞7 and 𝒞2 and show their efficacy.
Overall, we show that no the attacker gets any better than 3.3-bits
of advantage via different combinations of classifiers.

absolute value, and passed to a fully connected layer (with single
output neuron) that outputs the probability. Two distance functions,
i.e., absolute value |v0 − v1| and the square of differences (v0 − v1)2
have been used in our experiments. Absolute distance function
provided superior performance with ne = 64. We have explored
multiple Siamese architectures with various hyperparameters.
The best performing Siamese based classifier underperforms
single DNN models. The accuracy with and without the quality
values is 66% and 62% respectively.
F GENERALIZED “STITCHING” ATTACK
USING CLASSIFIERS
The trained classifiers {𝒞i} can be used to determine if a message
tuple of size i belongs to a single user. An attacker can use a com-
bination of 𝒞i’s to find a t-tuple of fingerprints belonging to the
same user. For example, the attacker, given b = 1 fingerprint w1,
can use 𝒞4 to find all 4-tuples S1 likely belonging to the same user
and containing w1. For each tuple w1...4 ∈ S1, the attacker then
uses 𝒞4 again to find remaining three fingerprints, by finding all
4-tuples which include, say, w4. Let call the second set, S2. Finally,
the attacker can apply MRec on the tuples in S2, to find a valid
7-tuple. The cost of this attack is C = N 3 ·cc +|S1| · N 3 ·cc +|S2| ·cs.
Let the false positive rate (FPR) of 𝒞4 be ν4, then |S1| = N 3 · ν4, and
4 · cs = 𝒪(N 6).
|S2| = |S1| · N 3 · ν4 = N 6 · ν2
More generally, an attacker can use a sequence of 𝒞i’s to stitch a
t-tuple. We can find all possible such classifier combinations using
the following equation.
