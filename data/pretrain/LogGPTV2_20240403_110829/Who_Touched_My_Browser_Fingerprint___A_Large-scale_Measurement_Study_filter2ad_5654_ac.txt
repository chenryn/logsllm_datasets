because those users visit our deployment website from more than
one browser instance. The bottom bar of Figure 3 shows that
68% of browser instances have only one cookie; to the opposite,
about 32% of browser instances have more than one cookie. As
stated, our manual investigation with controlled testing of Safari
Browser shows that intelligent tracking prevention and private
browsing are the major reasons of clearing cookies.
• Browser instance visits over time. Figure 4 shows the number
of browser instances broken down by first-time and returning
visitors across our measurement period. A browser instance is
marked as a returning visitor, if its browser ID has been seen
in our dataset before. The first thing worth noting is that the
number of total visits by browser instances in the first three
months is higher than the rest. The reason is that our deployment
website in general has more visitors during the holiday season,
which leads to the visit number decline in our dataset during the
remaining months. Second, returning browser instances make
up almost half of all the visitors each day—this fact indicates
that our deployment website has a considerable amount of loyal
users for us to collect enough dynamics data.
• Browser instances broken down by browser and OS types. We also
show the number of browser instances broken down by browser
types in Figure 5 and by OS types in Figure 6. Figure 5 shows
that our visitors are well distributed into different browser types
on both mobile and desktop platforms, i.e., being a good repre-
sentation of the Internet users; Figure 5 shows that Microsoft
Windows is still the mostly used OS in our dataset and the next
comes with iOS, which is used in both iPhones and Apple com-
puters. Figure 6 shows that the percentage of browser instances
using Android OS is on par with iOS. The number of Ubuntu and
Windows Phones is too small to be shown in the graph.
• Fingerprint stability per browser instance. We break down browser
instances (browser IDs) based on the number of visits and the
number of dynamics in Figure 7. When a browser instance visits
our deployment website for three or four times, about half of
browser instances remain stable without fingerprints changed.
The percentage keeps decreasing as the number of visits increases
and then stays at about one third.
3.2.2 Classification of Fingerprint Dynamics. We classify finger-
print changes into three categories based on their causes and show
them in Table 2:
• Browser or OS Updates. Browser or OS updates, taking up to
about 30% of total changes, refer to the client browser or OS
updates to a new version. Such an update may lead to a change

worth noting that IP information, such as city, region, and country,
also provides a considerable amount of information.
3.2 Dynamics Dataset
Our dynamics dataset contains 1,329,927 distinct browser instances:
661,827 of them visit the deployment website for more than one
time, which produces 960,853 pieces of dynamics information. In
the rest of the section, we first present statistics of browser instances
and then statistics of dynamics.
Statistics of Browser Instance. We now show some statistics
3.2.1
of browser instances in the dynamics dataset.
• User ID vs. Browser ID vs. Cookie. The top bar of Figure 3 shows
that approximately 86% user IDs (anonymized usernames) map
to only one browser ID while the rest maps to more than one

of dynamics related to user actions is timezone change, taking
up 40.49% of total browser instances in this category, which is
caused by a user movement from one location to another. The
reason that timezone change happens often is that our deploy-
ment website locates in Europe and many users travel from one
country to another for work.
Figure 7: A breakdown of the number of browser IDs based
on the number of dynamics and the number of visits (For
example, the solid, green bar above 3 on the x-axis indicates
the number of browser IDs satisfying the following two con-
ditions: (i) a browser instance visits our deployment website
for only three times and (ii) the fingerprint of that browser
instance changes only once—i.e., containing only one piece
of dynamics information. )
in the user agent string and other correlated features, such as
canvas rendering and the font list. We first look at OS updates:
iOS updates is the single largest portion, i.e., over 95%, of all the
updates, because all the subversions of iOS are included in the
user agent string. As a comparison, browser updates spread more
evenly across different browsers based on their use percentage. It
is worth noting that the percentage of browser instances with OS
and browser updates is relatively small, i.e., only 8.1% and 13.81%
respectively. That is, many browsers or OSes are not constantly
updated, which may lead to corresponding security issues.
Some user actions may lead to fingerprint dy-
namics, e.g., zooming in/out of the current page changes the
screen resolution provided by the browser. It is interesting that
only 13.4% of total browser instances have user-action-related
dynamics as opposed to 31.07% of total dynamics: Such a big gap
shows that a large portion of users do not perform actions that
can change fingerprint, but if a user does perform an action, it is
very likely that she may do it again in the future. One big portion
• User Actions.
• Environment Updates. When other software co-located with the
browser instance is updated, browser fingerprints may change
as well. First, some software updates, such as Microsoft Office
and Adobe Acrobat Readers, may introduce new fonts to the OS—
about 6.74% of environment updates belong to such category.
Second, one big subcategory of environment updates is due to
the change of emojis—87.6% of canvas rendering result updates
are caused by rendering emojis rather than texts. Lastly, other
environment factors, such as audio card information, system
languages, and color depth may change as well. It is also worth
noting that the percentage of browser instances with environ-
ment updates, i.e., 5.57%, is also the smallest compared with other
causes, although the percentage of dynamics with environment
updates is similar to the one of OS updates. The reason is that
environment updates have to happen when certain environment,
e.g., a specific type of software, co-exist with the browser. Take
Adobe Software for example—if someone does not use Adobe
Acrobat Reader, such environment updates will not exist for that
browser instance.
We also listed composite changes that lead to fingerprint changes.
The percentage of such composite changes aligns with the percent-
age of each single category because all the changes are independent.
For example, user actions and browser updates are two major cate-
gories and therefore the combination of these two is also the largest
category among all the possible combinations. It is worth noting
that the combination of browser and OS updates are not much,
because many browser and OS updates, especially on iOS platform
for Safari, is related and counted as OS updates already.
3.2.3 Breakdown of Dynamics by Features. We break down the
dynamics by different features and also show them in Table 1 under
the dynamics column. In total, we have observed 359,374 pieces
of distinct dynamics information; interesting, 306,554 of them, i.e.,
85%, are unique. Additionally, there are several things worth noting,
especially when comparing with the static values of each feature.
