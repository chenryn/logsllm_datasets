### Analysis of Packet Flows and Burstiness in TCP

#### Histograms for Different Flow Lengths
- The left histogram represents flows with more than 3 packets.
- The middle histogram depicts flows with more than 50 packets.
- The right histogram shows flows with more than 100 packets.

We observe that Long Transmission Flights (LTFs) are more common in flows with a larger number of packets. Specifically, over 75% of flows with more than 50 packets contain LTFs. We identified LTFs up to 16 Inter-Arrival Time Units (IATUs), which translates to an average of 40 or more packets. This confirms Conjecture 3, suggesting that LTFs can be large and may be identified as Constant Rate Flows (CRFs).

In such cases, we observed aggregations of two or three packets being transmitted at a constant rate. Our algorithm provides a straightforward method to identify CRFs. If a flow is considered a CRF when it has over 30 packets in equally spaced aggregations, approximately 12-15% of flows are constant-rate. These flows are not limited by PC clock speed, as noted by Brownlee and Claffy in [8].

#### Relationship with Network Environment
We now examine the relationship between flights and the characteristics of the path a flow traverses, including round-trip time (RTT), bandwidth, and Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP). RTT is defined as the total path delay, including queuing delays, and is measured using the SYN-ACK method, whose validity is well-established in [9].

**Short Transmission Flights (STFs)**
- Most STFs are two packets in size, regardless of the flow size.
- To determine if network characteristics affect STFs larger than two packets, we analyzed their occurrence across different RTT regimes. Figure 10 shows that the probability of observing an STF larger than two packets is about 1%, independent of RTT.

**Bandwidth and BDP**
- The probability of seeing at least one STF larger than two packets is nearly constant at 1% across different bandwidths (Figure 11).
- Similarly, the probability of observing at least one STF with more than two packets in relation to BDP is also about 1%, with a variation of less than 0.5%.

**LTF Sizes and BDP**
- Figure 12 illustrates the variation of LTF sizes as a function of BDP. On average, LTF sizes are higher at higher BDPs.
- The graph peaks at 10 kb, with an average LTF size of 5 (i.e., most flows in this regime had LTFs consisting of 12 or more packets).
- The number of data points decreases sharply after the peak, supporting Conjecture 4: high BDP environments are conducive to larger LTFs, indicating the network's capacity to absorb large windows of packets.

#### Conclusion
We studied deterministic temporal relations between TCP packets using several packet traces from different backbone fibers, representing a large fraction of Autonomous Systems (ASs) and prefixes. These traces provide insights into Internet traffic characteristics, as phenomena at the edges are reflected in temporal relations at the measurement point.

We examined packet aggregations at two time scales (5-10 ms and 50-1000 ms) to verify our hypothesis that two distinct facets of TCP structure give rise to different types of temporal relations. We proposed a simple threshold algorithm for identifying flights. Our TCP model predicted that high BDP environments would be conducive to CRFs, which exist only if the network is over-provisioned in terms of large buffers or bandwidth. Thus, CRFs indicate excess network resources.

Through statistical analysis of flight sizes and frequency, we verified Conjectures 1 and 3: STFs should be short, and LTFs can be long. We also verified Conjectures 2 and 4: STFs should not depend on the network environment, while LTFs benefit from large BDPs. This supports Hypotheses 1 and 2: delayed-acks give rise to STFs, and window dynamics give rise to LTFs. We concluded that about 12-15% of Internet flows in our traces do not operate in a congestion control region.

Future work will focus on how the occurrence of flights changes over the years on both backbone and access links to understand flights as indicators of excess network resources. This will help us determine whether congestion on the Internet has been increasing or decreasing over time.
