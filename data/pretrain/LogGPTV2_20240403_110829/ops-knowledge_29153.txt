User:  How to set SSH access permissions to improve system security?
Assistant: To improve system security, you need to set SSH access permissions through the following steps: 1. Disable SSH access for root user: Disable root user login to prevent attackers from using common password brute force attacks. 2. Modify the SSH port number: modifying the default port of the SSH service can effectively avoid brute force attacks. 3. Set SSH access control: realize whitelist or blacklist control by modifying SSH configuration files, and only allow specific IP addresses or network segments to access SSH. 4. Mandatory use of SSH key authentication: Using SSH key authentication is more secure than password authentication. Mandatory use of SSH key can prevent passwords from being guessed by attackers or attacks such as packet capture. 5. Configure SSH session timeout: Periodically clean up inactive SSH sessions, which can effectively prevent attackers from directly logging in to authenticated SSH sessions. 6. Regularly update the SSH service and system software: Regularly update the SSH service and other system software to avoid attacks from known vulnerabilities. 7. Add an intrusion detection system: Add an intrusion detection system to detect and block unauthorized SSH access in time.
