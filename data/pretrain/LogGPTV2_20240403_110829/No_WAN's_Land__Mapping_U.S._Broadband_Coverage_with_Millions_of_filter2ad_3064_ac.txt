### 4.1 Overstatements of Coverage by ISP

In this section, we examine coverage overstatements for each major Internet Service Provider (ISP). We assess overstatements as a whole, in rural areas, by available speed (according to FCC data), and the distribution of overstatements among census blocks. We illustrate how pronounced overstatements can be with a case study on Wisconsin and demonstrate the viability of our methods for detecting overreporting with a case study on AT&T.

#### Coverage Overstatements

Table 3 presents a comparison of coverage by each ISP according to the FCC’s data and our dataset of Broadband Availability Test (BAT) coverage outcomes. Our methodology is as follows:

1. **Census Block Filtering**: For each ISP, we start with the set of census blocks in our dataset where the ISP provides coverage according to Form 477. We then filter out census blocks where the ISP’s BAT returns "address unrecognized" or "response unknown" for every address. This step excludes census blocks where the BAT responses are entirely ambiguous.

2. **Address Labeling and Counting**: For each remaining address, if the ISP’s BAT returns coverage, we label the address as covered by both the FCC and BAT data. If the ISP’s BAT returns no coverage, we label the address as covered only by the FCC data. If the ISP’s BAT returns "address unrecognized" or an unknown response, we do not label the address as covered. We then compute a count of FCC-covered addresses, a count of BAT-covered addresses, and an address overstatement ratio of the two counts.

3. **Population Estimation**: We estimate the population covered by ISP \( i \) according to the FCC’s data \( P_{FCC}(i) \) and the population covered by \( i \) according to our BAT dataset \( P_{BAT}(i) \) using the following formulas:
   \[
   P_{FCC}(i) = \sum_{c \in C_i} p_c \cdot F_i(c)
   \]
   \[
   P_{BAT}(i) = \sum_{c \in C_i} p_c \cdot B_i(c)
   \]
   where \( C_i \) is the set of census blocks used to generate covered address counts for ISP \( i \), \( p_c \) is the population of each census block \( c \), \( B_i(c) \) is the BAT-covered address count for ISP \( i \) in census block \( c \), and \( F_i(c) \) is the FCC-covered address count for ISP \( i \) in census block \( c \). Finally, we calculate a population overstatement ratio: the BAT-covered population divided by the FCC-covered population.

Our analysis shows that overstatements are a significant problem across ISPs, especially for AT&T and Verizon. In just the nine states we studied, the FCC’s data overstates coverage by specific ISPs for millions of Americans.

#### Overstatements in Rural Areas

Table 3 also presents per-ISP overstatements by urban and rural area classification. The proportional overstatement of each ISP’s coverage is consistently larger in rural areas than in urban areas. Our data suggests that Verizon is a particular outlier for overstated coverage in rural areas—we estimate that Verizon service is not available to over half of the rural population that is covered according to FCC data.

#### Overstatements at Lower Speeds

Table 3 also presents overstatements by connection speed. We add a speed threshold to our criteria for excluding census blocks, where the speed for an ISP in a block is the maximum speed the ISP reports to the FCC in that block. We examine two speed thresholds: any service (≥ 0 Mbps) and service at benchmark speed (≥ 25 Mbps).

We find that the FCC’s data is consistently less accurate for addresses in lower-speed census blocks. This effect is proportionally much larger in rural areas compared to urban areas, and it is particularly significant for rural addresses covered by AT&T and Verizon in the FCC’s data. For example, Verizon is an outlier in rural coverage overstatement when considering all speed tiers, but its overstatement ratio is roughly consistent with other ISPs when considering only blocks with benchmark broadband.

We hypothesize that the disproportionate coverage inaccuracy for lower-speed service in rural areas is attributable, at least in part, to network technology. In areas where Form 477 data indicates that the maximum service speed is below 25 Mbps, AT&T and Verizon report offering ADSL almost exclusively; in areas with higher maximum speeds, the providers offer newer VDSL and fiber connectivity. These ISPs may have more accurate coverage data for the newer network technologies because building the network infrastructure provided an opportunity and incentive to map possible service addresses. For legacy network technologies, by contrast, the ISPs may be investing less in mapping and might rely on simple models for coverage when reporting to the FCC (e.g., distance from central office DSLAMs for DSL connectivity).

#### Distribution of Overstatements

Coverage overstatements are unevenly distributed among census blocks. Figure 3 shows, for each major ISP, the cumulative distribution function for the address overstatement ratio in each block. Our analysis demonstrates that the median coverage within census blocks is 100% for every ISP, and the 25th percentile coverage is also 100% for every ISP except AT&T and Verizon. At lower percentiles, however, the address overstatement ratio drops significantly. Thus, the majority of coverage overstatements are confined to a minority of census blocks.

#### Possible Overreporting

Our results surface census blocks that are covered by an ISP in Form 477 data but in which we do not observe any coverage based on BAT responses. We cannot definitively determine whether these blocks reflect ISP overreporting, as we lack conventional ground truth and the FCC allows reporting coverage where an ISP could soon provide service. Nevertheless, these results raise concerns about whether ISPs have accurately reported coverage and the clarity of FCC reporting guidelines.

For examining possible overreporting, we are especially conservative in our analysis. We do not consider a census block as possible overreporting if our dataset has few addresses in the block (less than 20). We also do not consider a census block as possible overreporting for an ISP if there is even one BAT response for the ISP that is anything other than a "not covered" address.

Table 4 presents the count of census blocks, for each ISP and by speed tier, where we observe no covered address and the block passes the filtering just described. The table also includes, as context, the total number of census blocks that the ISP covers according to the FCC’s data. We find evidence of possible overreporting by every provider, and especially by AT&T and Verizon at lower service speeds. We emphasize again that we cannot definitively determine whether these are instances of overreporting, and while our results call into question reported coverage for thousands of census blocks, that number of census blocks is relatively small in comparison to overall provider coverage.

#### Case Study: Census Blocks in Wisconsin

To clearly visualize the problem of coverage overstatements, Figure 4 maps census blocks with acute overstatement in Wisconsin. We show eight blocks: four covered by AT&T and four by CenturyLink according to Form 477 data. In each block, nearly every address lacks coverage by the relevant ISP according to its BAT. Due to the Form 477 data collection methods, however, these blocks appear to be fully covered in FCC data.

### Additional Datasets

Throughout our analysis, we rely on several additional datasets:
- Census block population estimates (from a 2018 FCC release [61])
- Census block urban and rural classifications (from the 2010 U.S. Census [70])
- Census tract demographic and poverty data (from the 2018 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey with five-year estimates)

These datasets help us to better understand and contextualize the coverage overstatements.
