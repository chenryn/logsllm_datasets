Throughout our analysis, we rely on several additional datasets:
census block population estimates (from a 2018 FCC release [61]),
census block urban and rural classifications (from the 2010 U.S.
Census [70]), and census tract demographic and poverty data (from
the 2018 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey with
five-year estimates).15
4.1 Overstatements of Coverage by ISP
In this section, we examine coverage overstatements for each major
ISP. We assess overstatements as a whole, overstatements in rural
areas, overstatements by available speed (according to FCC data),
and the distribution of overstatements among census blocks. We
illustrate how pronounced overstatements can be with a case study
on Wisconsin, and we also demonstrate the viability of our methods
for detecting overreporting with a case study on AT&T.
Coverage Overstatements. Table 3 presents a comparison of
coverage by each ISP according to the FCC’s data and our dataset
of BAT coverage outcomes. We arrive at these results as follows.
For each ISP, we begin with the set of census blocks in our dataset
where the ISP provides coverage according to Form 477. We then
filter out census blocks where the ISP’s BAT returns address unrec-
ognized or response unknown for every address. This step excludes
census blocks where the BAT responses are entirely ambiguous.
We next generate ISP-specific labels and counts for covered
addresses. For each address in the remaining census blocks, if the
ISP’s BAT returns coverage, we label the address as covered by
the FCC and BAT data. If the ISP’s BAT returns no coverage, we
15Census tracts are larger U.S. Census Bureau units of analysis than census blocks.

label the address as covered only by the FCC data. If the ISP’s
BAT returns address unrecognized or an unknown response, we
do not label the address as covered.16 We then compute a count of
FCC covered addresses, a count of BAT covered addresses, and an
address overstatement ratio of the two counts.
Intuitively, this method provides a conservative address count by
making no assumption (covered or not covered) about an address
when an ISP’s BAT does not provide a clear coverage status. The
left-hand side of Table 3 presents the results of this method.
Next, we estimate the population covered by ISP 𝑖 according to
the FCC’s data 𝑃𝐹𝐶𝐶(𝑖) and the population covered by 𝑖 according
to our BAT dataset 𝑃𝐵𝐴𝑇 (𝑖) by computing:
and 𝑃𝐵𝐴𝑇 (𝑖) =
𝑃𝐹𝐶𝐶(𝑖) =

𝑝𝑐 ∗ 𝐵𝑖(𝑐)
𝐹𝑖(𝑐)

where 𝐶𝑖 is the set of census blocks used to generate covered address
counts for ISP 𝑖, 𝑝𝑐 is the population of each census block 𝑐, 𝐵𝑖(𝑐)
is the BAT covered address count for ISP 𝑖 in census block 𝑐, and
𝐹𝑖(𝑐) is the FCC covered address count for ISP 𝑖 in census block
𝑐. Finally, we calculate a population overstatement ratio: the BAT
covered population divided by the FCC covered population.
Intuitively, our method adjusts the covered population for each
ISP at the census block level by applying the address overstatement
ratio for the block derived from BAT responses. The right-hand
side of Table 3 presents the results of this method.
We find that overstatements are a significant problem across
ISPs, and especially for AT&T and Verizon coverage. Our analysis

suggests that in just the nine states that we study, the FCC’s data
overstates coverage by specific ISPs for millions of Americans.
Overstatements in Rural Areas. We additionally present per-
ISP overstatements by urban and rural area classification in Table 3.
The proportional overstatement of each ISP’s coverage is consis-
tently larger in rural areas than in urban areas. Our data suggests
that Verizon is a particular outlier for overstated coverage in rural
areas—we estimate that Verizon service is not available to over half
of the rural population that is covered according to FCC data.
Overstatements at Lower Speeds. Table 3 also presents over-
statements by connection speed. For this analysis, we add a speed
threshold to our criteria for excluding census blocks, where the
speed for an ISP in a block is the maximum speed the ISP reports
to the FCC in that block. We examine two speed thresholds: any
service (≥ 0 Mbps) and service at benchmark speed (≥ 25 Mbps).
We find that the FCC’s data is consistently less accurate for
addresses in lower-speed census blocks. This effect is proportionally
much larger in rural areas in comparison to urban areas, and the
effect is particularly significant for rural addresses that are covered
by AT&T and Verizon in the FCC’s data. Verizon, for example, is an
outlier in rural coverage overstatement when considering all speed
tiers—but its overstatement ratio is roughly consistent with other
ISPs whe considering only blocks with benchmark broadband.
We hypothesize that the disproportionate coverage inaccuracy
for lower-speed service in rural areas is attributable, at least in part,
to network technology. In areas where Form 477 data indicates that
the maximum service speed is below 25 Mbps, AT&T and Verizon
report offering ADSL almost exclusively; in areas with higher maxi-
mum speeds, the providers offer newer VDSL and fiber connectivity.
These ISPs may have more accurate coverage data for the newer
network technologies because building the network infrastructure
provided an opportunity and incentive to map possible service ad-
dresses. For the legacy network technologies, by contrast, the ISPs
may be investing less in mapping and might rely on simple models
for coverage when reporting to the FCC (e.g., distance from central
office DSLAMs for DSL connectivity).
Distribution of Overstatements. Coverage overstatements
are unevenly distributed among census blocks. Fig. 3 shows, for
each major ISP, the cumulative distribution function for the address
overstatement ratio in each block. Our analysis demonstrates that
the median coverage within census blocks is 100% for every ISP,
and the 25th percentile coverage is also 100% for every ISP except
AT&T and Verizon. At lower percentiles, however, the address over-
statement ratio drops significantly. Thus, the majority of coverage
overstatements are confined to a minority of census blocks.
Possible Overreporting. Our results surface census blocks that
are covered by an ISP in Form 477 data, but in which we do not ob-
serve any coverage based on BAT responses. We cannot definitively
determine whether these blocks reflect ISP overreporting, because
we lack conventional ground truth and the FCC allows reporting
coverage where an ISP could soon provide service [12]. Neverthe-
less, these results raise concerns about whether ISPs have accurately
reported coverage and the clarity of FCC reporting guidelines.
For purposes of examining possible overreporting, we are espe-
cially conservative in our analysis. We do not consider a census
block as possible overreporting if our dataset has few addresses in
the block (less than 20). We also do not consider a census block as

possible overreporting for an ISP if there is even one BAT response
for the ISP that is anything other than a not covered address.
Table 4 presents the count of census blocks, for each ISP and
by speed tier, where we observe no covered address and the block
passes the filtering just described. The table also includes, as context,
the total number of census blocks that the ISP covers according to
the FCC’s data. We find evidence of possible overreporting by every
provider, and especially by AT&T and Verizon at lower service
speeds. We emphasize again that we cannot definitively determine
whether these are instances of overreporting, and while our results
call into question reported coverage for thousands of census blocks,
that number of census blocks is relatively small in comparison to
overall provider coverage.
Case Study: Census Blocks in Wisconsin. In order to clearly
visualize the problem of coverage overstatements, Fig. 4 maps cen-
sus blocks with acute overstatement. We show eight blocks in Wis-
consin: four covered by AT&T and four by CenturyLink according
to Form 477 data. In each block, nearly every address lacks coverage
by the relevant ISP according to its BAT. Because of the Form 477
data collection methods, however, these blocks appear to be fully
covered in FCC data.
