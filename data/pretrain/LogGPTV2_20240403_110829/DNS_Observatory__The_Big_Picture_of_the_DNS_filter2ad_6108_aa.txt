ABSTRACT
The Domain Name System (DNS) is thought of as having the simple-
sounding task of resolving domains into IP addresses. With its
stub resolvers, different layers of recursive resolvers, authoritative
nameservers, a multitude of query types, and DNSSEC, the DNS
ecosystem is actually quite complex.
In this paper, we introduce DNS Observatory: a new stream
analytics platform that provides a bird’s-eye view on the DNS.
As the data source, we leverage a large stream of passive DNS
observations produced by hundreds of globally distributed probes,
acquiring a peak of 200 k DNS queries per second between recursive
resolvers and authoritative nameservers. For each observed DNS
transaction, we extract traffic features, aggregate them, and track
the top-k DNS objects, e.g., the top authoritative nameserver IP
addresses or the top domains.
We analyze 1.6 trillion DNS transactions over a four month pe-
riod. This allows us to characterize DNS deployments and traffic
patterns, evaluate its associated infrastructure and performance,
as well as gain insight into the modern additions to the DNS and
related Internet protocols. We find an alarming concentration of
DNS traffic: roughly half of the observed traffic is handled by only
1 k authoritative nameservers and by 10 AS operators. By evalu-
ating the median delay of DNS queries, we find that the top 10 k
nameservers have indeed a shorter response time than less popular
nameservers, which is correlated with less router hops.
We also study how DNS TTL adjustments can impact query
volumes, anticipate upcoming changes to DNS infrastructure, and
how negative caching TTLs affect the Happy Eyeballs algorithm.
We find some popular domains with a a share of up to 90 % of empty
DNS responses due to short negative caching TTLs. We propose
actionable measures to improve uncovered DNS shortcomings.

1 INTRODUCTION
Although the DNS dates back to 1983, when Mockapetris published
its original specification in RFCs 882 and 883 [45, 46], it still re-
mains one of the key protocols of the Internet. Since then, various
authors have published a staggering number of 3200 pages of RFC
documents (counting Internet Standard, Proposed Standard, and
Informational documents), which demonstrates how deceptive it
is to think that DNS is simple, well understood, or already stud-
ied enough [31–33, 67]. In this context, we see Internet engineers
struggling for a faster, better connected, and more secure Web—
through the adoption of IPv6, HTTP/2, QUIC, and TLS 1.3—all of
which are directly affected by the DNS. We believe that big-scale
measurements of the DNS in the wild are essential to understand
and revise it, so that the DNS stays on par with the improvements
made to other key protocols of the Internet.
Modern, large-scale authoritative DNS servers employ high lev-
els of complexity. First, they employ IP anycast [1], meaning that
the same prefix can be announced from multiple locations around
the globe. Secondly, the contents of a DNS response may depend on
where the user is located: authoritative servers can be configured
to give different DNS answers based on geo-location, latency, and
content filtering policy [6]. As such, any researchers attempting to
evaluate DNS will—depending on their vantage point—have only
a partial view of a DNS zone. Besides, whenever they employ ac-
tive measurements on DNS zones, they have to actively query for
pre-obtained domain lists, which skews the results even more [60].
This paper introduces DNS Observatory, a novel stream analyt-
ics platform that mitigates the issue of vantage point location by
collecting data from hundreds of DNS resolvers distributed around
the world, and which stores only aggregate information extracted
from the traffic between resolvers and authoritative nameservers.
We analyze the data collected in DNS Observatory from January
until April 2019, totaling 1.6 trillion DNS transactions, and report
on our findings. We present the Big Picture of the DNS, which
helps us to better understand DNS traffic distributions, global DNS
performance, impact and dynamics of the TTLs, and the possible
consequences of the Happy Eyeballs algorithm on IPv4-only sites,
due to negative caching misconfigurations. We believe our work
can help in making informed improvements to the DNS, and to
bolster DNS research in general.
Our main contributions include:
DNS Observatory This work presents DNS Observatory (DO),
which is built on hundreds of globally distributed resolver
vantage points (VPs). It aggregates up to 200 k DNS queries
per second in a stream of top-k DNS objects, which can be
used for various analyses. We elaborate on the design and
architecture of DO in section 2.
Big Picture We analyze the big picture of DNS in terms of traffic
distributions, query types, response delays, Autonomous

Systems, and QNAME minimization deployment in section 3.
We find that 50% of observed DNS traffic is likely handled
by just top 1,000 nameservers, and by IP prefixes managed
by just 10 organizations.
Dissecting TTLs We perform an in-depth analysis of TTLs, specif-
ically their correlation with traffic and infrastructure changes
in section 4.
Happy Eyeballs and Negative Caching We evaluate the effect
of low negative caching TTLs and the Happy Eyeballs al-
gorithm used by IPv6 enabled clients in section 5. We find
some domains with more than 90 % of all responses being
empty due to low negative caching TTLs. Finally, we propose
actionable steps to ameliorate the current state.
We begin the paper by introducing terminology, describing raw
DNS traffic data sources, and elaborating on methodology in Section
2. Then, in Sections 3, 4, and 5 we present our findings on the DNS.
In Section 6, we refer the reader to related works and datasets. We
conclude in Section 7, inviting academic researchers to access the
data collected in DNS Observatory.
2 DNS OBSERVATORY
In this section, we present our methodology, i.e., our data process-
ing pipeline, which involves: obtaining raw data, preprocessing,
tracking objects, measuring DNS traffic, and producing time se-
ries data for various time aggregations. The overall design of DNS
Observatory is presented in Figure 1.
Before we describe our system in detail, we make a note on the
terminology used in this paper. We use the terms “resolver” and
“nameserver” to refer to a particular IP address used by a recursive
DNS resolver and authoritative DNS name server, respectively. The
terms “Top-Level Domain” (TLD) and “Second-Level Domain” (SLD)
refer to, respectively, the last 1 and the last 2 labels in Fully-Qualified
Domain Names (FQDNs). The term “effective TLDs” (eTLDs) refer
to the ICANN domains listed in the Public Suffix List [49] (e.g.,
.co.uk), and “effective SLD” (eSLD) is simply a label directly under
an eTLD (e.g., bbc.co.uk).
2.1 Preprocessing raw data
Our data comes from a large stream of passive observations of DNS
traffic between recursive resolvers and authoritative nameservers,
i.e., essentially we analyze the DNS cache-miss query-response
transactions above DNS resolvers. The stream comes from the Se-
curity Information Exchange (SIE), an open platform operated by
Farsight Security, Inc.. SIE resembles an Internet Exchange Point
(IXP) and allows the cooperating parties to exchange Internet secu-
rity information in real-time [22].
DNS Observatory ingests the main passive DNS stream available
on the platform, which peaks at 200 k DNS transactions per second
and comes from hundreds of resolvers. The data is contributed
by many parties spread around the world, including: North and
Central America, Western Europe and UK, Eastern Europe and
Russia, Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Australia. The contrib-
utors include large ISPs, recursive DNS providers, hosting farms,
social media platforms, Internet security companies, universities,
financial institutions, etc. The data is generated by open source
software—usually deployed directly on the resolver machine—that
reconstructs the DNS transactions by capturing raw IP packets
from network interfaces [20].
In more detail, we analyze UDP/53 transactions with either both
the query and the response packets, or the query alone (in case
of no response). Support for TCP/53 is planned as future work,
but note that it constitutes only <3% of Internet traffic [36, 63].
Each transaction includes raw packets, starting at the IP header,
and detailed timestamps. Transactions are serialized using Protocol
Buffers [29] and submitted to the platform. From there, we read the
stream, deserialize the data, parse IP headers and DNS payloads,
and summarize each transaction with a line of text.
We retain only the relevant pieces of information, e.g., resolver
and nameserver IP address, response delay, DNS header contents,
queried name, and select DNS record data. Our goal is to make the
data easier to process in the next steps, given the data volume.
2.2 Tracking Top-k objects
The basic tool we use for DNS Observatory is the Space-Saving
algorithm (SS) [44], which allows us to keep track of the most fre-
quently queried nameservers—or, in more general, to continuously
track the Top-k DNS objects in our data stream—while keeping
memory usage under control.
A DNS object is any entity within the DNS, identified with a
textual key: the value of any transaction detail, or a combination
thereof. For example—although the primary objects we consider
are the nameserver IP addresses—we may study the most popular
FQDNs, returned IP addresses, or combinations of the FQDN and
its IP address. When desirable, we may also filter the input traffic,
e.g., consider only the transactions involving root nameservers, or
the responses with the Authoritative Answer (AA) flag set.
Note that usually the number of DNS objects is too large to keep
track of all of them, e.g., all FQDNs seen in DNS. However, their
distributions are often heavy-tailed, i.e., a relatively small number
of the most frequent objects cover a large fraction of all observed
DNS transactions. Thus, the usage of the SS algorithm allows us to
obtain a big picture of the DNS.
When a new transaction is observed, we extract its key (e.g.,
the nameserver IP address) and check if the corresponding object
exists in the SS cache. If yes, we update its frequency estimate—
an exponentially decaying moving average that tracks the rate of
transactions per second for this object. If no, we evict the least
frequent object, and insert the new object instead, but keeping
(and updating) the frequency estimate of the evicted entry. In the
latter case, we optionally consult a Bloom Filter [7] before doing
the eviction, in order to skip incidental observations of rare keys.
Note that although at this point we already know the estimated
rates of traffic for each object, e.g., hits per second for a nameserver
IP address, we do not use them after this step. We only maintain a
list of the currently most popular objects in the input data stream.
Each live object in the SS cache has a separate state used for traffic
statistics, which we update in the next step.
2.3 Measuring traffic features
Each transaction ends up either being aggregated in statistics of a
particular DNS object from the SS cache, or being dropped in case
the corresponding object is not in the cache.
