if 𝑥 = 1
We say that a label expression 𝑤 is strongly independent if
𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑤) is a set of independent keys and, if 𝑤 = (𝑏, (𝑘0, 𝑘1))
is a single label then 𝑘0 ≠ 𝑘1, and if 𝑤 = (𝑢, 𝑣) where 𝑢
and 𝑣 are label expressions, then 𝑢 and 𝑣 are both strongly
independent and 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑢) ∩ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑣) = ∅.
Let us start with some technical lemmas that are helpful to
derive our main result. The ﬁrst lemma can be easily veriﬁed
by induction on the deﬁnition of 𝙶𝚋.
Lemma 4. For any circuit 𝐶 and label expression 𝑢, if ̃𝐶, 𝑣 =
𝙶𝚋(𝐶, 𝑢) and 𝑘 ∈ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬( ̃𝐶)∩𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬( ̃𝐶), then 𝑘 ∈ 𝐊 is an atomic
key symbol.
Our next lemma shows that 𝙶𝚋 produces strongly inde-
pendent output labels from strongly independent input labels.
Furthermore, any key in the output label expression is yielded
from either a new atomic key introduced in the garbled circuit
or a key in the input labels, and it does not yield any other key
in the garbled circuit. The formal proof is done using structural
induction on circuits, and it is omitted due to space constraint.
Lemma 5. For any circuit 𝐶 and any strongly independent
label expression 𝑢 such that ̃𝐶, 𝑣 = 𝙶𝚋(𝐶, 𝑢), 𝑣 is strongly
independent, and the following hold for all 𝑘 ∈ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑣):
1) 𝖦+(𝑘) ∩ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(( ̃𝐶, 𝑢)) = ∅;
2) ∃𝑘′ ∈ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(( ̃𝐶, 𝑢)) ∩ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬(( ̃𝐶, 𝑢)).𝑘′ ⪯ 𝑘.
A quick observation on 𝙶𝚋 is that, for any circuit 𝐶, if 𝑘 ∈
𝐏𝐚𝐭(𝕂) appears in
̃𝐶, then either 𝑘 is in a plaintext message
and so 𝑘 ∈ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬( ̃𝐶), or 𝑘 is used as an encryption key. The
former case has been considered in Lemma 4. The following
lemma characterizes the latter case, and it can be proved using
structural induction on circuits.
Lemma 6. For any circuit 𝐶 and any label expression 𝑢 such
𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬( ̃𝐶) for some expression 𝑒 and some key 𝑘 ∈ 𝐏𝐚𝐭(𝕂),
then the following hold:
that 𝑢 is strongly independent and ̃𝐶, 𝑣 = 𝙶𝚋(𝐶, 𝑢), if ⦃𝑒⦄𝑘 ∈
1) 𝖦+(𝑘) ∩ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬( ̃𝐶) = ∅;
2) 𝖦∗(𝑘) ∩ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑣) = ∅;
3) ∃𝑘′ ∈ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(( ̃𝐶, 𝑢)) ∩ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬(( ̃𝐶, 𝑢)).𝑘′ ⪯ 𝑘.
For the rest of paper, let us ﬁx a circuit 𝐶 ∈ Circuit(𝑠, 𝑡)
and a boolean vector 𝑥 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛
, where 𝑠 is a shape of 𝑛 wires
and 𝑡 is a shape of 𝑚 wires. Let 𝑒 = ( ̃𝐶, ̃𝑥) = 𝙶𝚊𝚛𝚋𝚕𝚎(𝐶, 𝑥) be
156
the symbolic expression of the garbled circuit and the garbled
input of 𝐶 on input 𝑥. Since 𝑒 is monotone, the greatest ﬁxed
point of 𝑒 exists and it can be computed in polynomially
many steps. Let 𝑆 = Fix(𝑒) and 𝑒′ = 𝐩(𝑒, 𝑆). Then
𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐬(𝑆) ⊆ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑒) and 𝑆 = 𝑒(𝑆) = 𝐫(𝐩(𝑒, 𝑆)) = 𝐫(𝑒′).
For any label (𝑏, (𝑘0, 𝑘1)), we say that it satisﬁes the label
invariant if
(1)
𝑏 ∈ 𝐁, ∃𝑧 ∈ {0, 1} such that 𝑘𝑧 ∈ 𝑆, 𝑘1−𝑧 ∉ 𝑆,
and we call 𝑧 the actual value of the label (𝑏, (𝑘0, 𝑘1)).
Lemma 7. For any sub-circuit 𝐶′ of 𝐶, and for any label
expression 𝑢, if ̃𝐶′, 𝑣 = 𝙶𝚋(𝐶′, 𝑢) and all labels (𝑏, (𝑘0, 𝑘1)) ⋐
𝑢 satisfy the label invariant, then all labels (̄𝑏, (̄𝑘0, ̄𝑘1)) ⋐ 𝑣
satisfy the label invariant.
Proof. We use induction on the structure of circuit 𝐶′. For
the base case, 𝐶′ is an atomic circuit:
̄𝑏 = 𝑏,
𝑣 is also a sub-expression of 𝑢. So the lemma holds.
∙ 𝐶′ = 𝐒𝐰𝐚𝐩, 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐜, or 𝐔𝐧𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐨𝐜: Any label (̄𝑏, (̄𝑘0, ̄𝑘1)) ⋐
∙ 𝐶′ = 𝐃𝐮𝐩: Suppose 𝑢 = (𝑏, (𝑘0, 𝑘1)) satisﬁes the label
invariant with an actual value 𝑧. If (̄𝑏, (̄𝑘0, ̄𝑘1)) ⋐ 𝑣,
̄𝑘1 = 𝖦ℎ(𝑘1) for some
̄𝑘0 = 𝖦ℎ(𝑘0), and
then
̄𝑏 ∈ 𝐁. Let ̄𝑧 = 𝑧. Then
̄𝑘 ̄𝑧 = 𝖦ℎ(𝑘𝑧) ∈ 𝑆.
ℎ ∈ {0, 1}. So
̄𝑘1− ̄𝑧 ∈ 𝑆. Then
Assume towards a contradiction that
𝖦ℎ(𝑘1−𝑧) = ̄𝑘1− ̄𝑧 ∈ 𝖦∗(𝑘′) for some 𝑘′ ∈ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑒′) where
𝑘′ ∈ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬(𝑒′) or ∃𝑘′′ ∈ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬(𝑒′) such that 𝑘′ ≺ 𝑘′′.
Notice that 𝑒′ = 𝐩(( ̃𝐶, ̃𝑥), 𝑆) = (𝐩( ̃𝐶, 𝑆), 𝐩( ̃𝑥, 𝑆)), and ̃𝑥
contains only atomic keys. So 𝑘′′ ∈ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬( ̃𝐶′) ⊆ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬( ̃𝐶).
We have two cases:
– 𝖦ℎ(𝑘1−𝑧) ≠ 𝑘′: 𝑘1−𝑧 ∈ 𝖦∗(𝑘′) ⊆ 𝑆, a contradiction.
– 𝖦ℎ(𝑘1−𝑧) = 𝑘′: Now 𝑘′ ∉ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬(𝑒′), and thus
⦃𝑔′⦄𝑘′ ∈ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬(𝑒′) for some pattern 𝑔′. So⦃𝑔′⦄𝑘′ ∈
𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬(𝐩( ̃𝐶, 𝑆)) and ⦃𝑔⦄𝑘′ ∈ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬( ̃𝐶) for some
expression 𝑔 such that 𝑔′ = 𝐩(𝑔, 𝑆). By Lemma 6,
𝖦+(𝑘′) ∩ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬( ̃𝐶) = ∅ and hence 𝑘′′ ∉ 𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐬( ̃𝐶), a
contradiction.

Therefore (̄𝑏, (̄𝑘0, ̄𝑘1)) satisﬁes the label invariant.

Next, consider composite circuits. Assume the lemma holds
for all sub-circuits of 𝐶′. Then we have these cases:

0 and 𝐶′

are both sub-circuits of 𝐶′, by assumption we see that
Condition 1 holds for all labels in 𝑢 and consequently, for
all labels in 𝑤, and so it holds for all labels in 𝑣.
∙ 𝐶′ = 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭(𝐶′′): Suppose 𝑢 = (𝑢′′, 𝑤) and 𝑣 = (𝑣′′, 𝑤)
̃𝐶, 𝑣′′ = 𝙶𝚋(𝐶′′, 𝑢′′). For any label (̄𝑏, (̄𝑘0, ̄𝑘1)) ⋐
such that
𝑣, it is either a sub-expression of 𝑣′′ or it is a sub-
expression of 𝑤. For the former case, since 𝐶′′
is a
sub-circuit of 𝐶′, Condition 1 holds for (̄𝑏, (̄𝑘0, ̄𝑘1)) by
induction hypothesis. For the latter case, since 𝑤 ⋐ 𝑢,
Condition 1 holds for this label by assumption.
Therefore the lemma holds for any circuit 𝐶.
Let 𝑓 = ( ̂𝐶, ̂𝑥) = 𝚂𝚒𝚖𝚞𝚕𝚊𝚝𝚎(𝐶, 𝐶(𝑥)) be the symbolic
expression of simulated garbled circuit of 𝐶 on output 𝐶(𝑥).
Let 𝑇 = Fix(𝑓 ), which satisﬁes 𝑓 (𝑇 ) = 𝐫(𝐩(𝑓 , 𝑇 )) = 𝑇 .
The following lemma shows that, for each key pair 𝑘0, 𝑘1 in
𝑓 , exactly one of 𝑘0 and 𝑘1 is in 𝑇 .
Lemma 8. For any sub-circuit 𝐶′ of 𝐶 and any label
expression 𝑢 such that ̂𝐶′, 𝑣 = 𝚂𝚒𝚖(𝐶′, 𝑢),
labels
(𝑏, (𝑘0, 𝑘1)) ⋐ 𝑢 satisfy the label invariant with actual value 0,
then all labels (̄𝑏, (̄𝑘0, ̄𝑘1)) ⋐ 𝑣 satisfy the label invariant with
actual value 0.
