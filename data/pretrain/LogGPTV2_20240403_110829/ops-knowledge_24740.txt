User: If we need to upgrade the hardware on a batch of servers, but cannot shut down, provide a feasible solution.
Assistant: A feasible solution is to first install the hardware to be upgraded on a standby server, configure the standby server to be the same as the original server, and then migrate data to the standby server through the network. Once the data migration is complete, upgrade the hardware on the original server. After the upgrade is complete, the data on the standby server will be migrated back to the original server to achieve zero downtime upgrade.
