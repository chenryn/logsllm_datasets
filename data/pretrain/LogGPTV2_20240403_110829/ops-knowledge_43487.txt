User: I installed Python Anaconda on Mac (OS Mavericks). I wanted to revert to the default version of Python on my Mac. What's the best way to do this? Should I delete the ~/anaconda directory? Any other changes required? 
Currently when I run which python I get this path:
/Users/username/anaconda/bin/python
Assistant: The anaconda installer adds a line in your ~/.bash_profile script that prepends the anaconda bin directory to your $PATH environment variable. Deleting the anaconda directory should be all you need to do, but it's good housekeeping to remove this line from your setup script too.
