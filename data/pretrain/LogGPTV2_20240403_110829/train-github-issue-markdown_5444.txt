### Optimized Text

**Get the Best Price**

If you want to hide the text on extra-small screens (xs) while maintaining the inline behavior of the span, using `display: block !important` can cause the text to break. Even with Bootstrap, the same issue occurs at the smallest mobile breakpoints.

### Suggested Solution

To hide the text on extra-small screens without breaking the layout, you can use the following CSS:

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .hidden-xs {
        display: none !important;
    }
}
```

Then, apply the class to your span:

```html
<span class="hidden-xs">Get the Best Price</span>
```

This approach ensures that the text is hidden on xs screens while maintaining the inline behavior of the span on larger screens.
