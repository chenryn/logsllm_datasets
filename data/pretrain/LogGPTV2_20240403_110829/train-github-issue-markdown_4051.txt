Place a macro like `panic!` or `println!` outside of a function body:
    panic!("outside of a function");
    fn main() { }
The error message does not provide the expansion site:
    :2:1: 2:2 error: macro expansion ignores token `{` and any following
    :2 {
                   ^
    error: aborting due to previous error
A similar effect is had in an impl body.
    struct Foo;
    impl Foo{
      panic!("in impl body");
    }
    fn main() {}
    ----------------------
    :2:1: 2:2 error: expected `fn`, found `{`
    :2 {
                   ^
