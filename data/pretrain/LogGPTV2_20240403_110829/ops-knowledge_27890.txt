User: How to deploy a web application using Docker containerization technology? How to manage deployment of multiple containers with Docker Compose?
Assistant: To deploy a web application using Docker containerization technology: 1. Create a Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions for building an image in a Docker container. In the Dockerfile, you need to specify the base image, install dependencies, copy files, set environment variables, and other operations. 2. Build the image: use the docker build command to build the image according to the Dockerfile, such as: docker build -t webapp . 3. Run the container: use the docker run command to create and run the container, such as: docker run -p 8080:80 -d webapp 4. Access the web application: By accessing the host IP and mapped port, you can access the web application running in the container. Use Docker Compose to manage the deployment of multiple containers: 1. Create a docker-compose.yml file: docker-compose.yml is a file in YAML format, which is used to define the configuration of services, networks, volumes, etc. of multiple containers. Define information such as mirrors, ports, and environment variables for each service. 2. Start services: Use the docker-compose up command to start all services, for example: docker-compose up -d 3. Manage services: Use the docker-compose ps command to view the status of all services. Use the docker-compose stop command to stop all service containers. Use the docker-compose rm command to remove all service containers and networks. 4. Update service: After modifying the service configuration in docker-compose.yml, use the docker-compose up -d command to restart the service and apply the latest configuration.
