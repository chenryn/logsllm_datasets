### Debugging the Assertion Error in Flutter

You are encountering the following assertion error during a scheduler callback:

```
The following assertion was thrown during a scheduler callback:
Child with id 73 is invisible and should not be added to the tree.
'package:flutter/src/semantics/semantics.dart': Failed assertion: line 671
pos 16: '!child.isInvisible'
```

This error indicates that an invisible child widget is being added to the widget tree, which is not allowed. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Identify the Widget**: 
   - The error message mentions a specific child with ID 73. You need to identify which widget in your code has this ID. If the IDs are not explicitly set, you may need to use a debugger or add logging statements to track down the problematic widget.

2. **Check Visibility Logic**:
   - Ensure that the widget is not marked as invisible (e.g., using `Visibility` widget with `visible: false` or setting `opacity: 0.0` on an `Opacity` widget) before it is added to the tree.

3. **Review Parent Widgets**:
   - Check the parent widgets that are adding this child. Ensure that they are not inadvertently adding invisible children. This might involve reviewing the logic in custom widgets or any state management logic.

4. **Use Flutter DevTools**:
   - Flutter DevTools can help you inspect the widget tree and visualize the structure of your app. You can use the "Widget Inspector" to see the current state of your widget tree and identify where the invisible child is being added.

5. **Dump the Widget Tree**:
   - To dump the entire widget tree, you can use the `debugDumpApp()` function. Add the following code to your `main` function or a suitable place in your app:

     ```dart
     import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

     void main() {
       debugPrint = print; // Optional: Redirect debugPrint to the console
       runApp(MyApp());
       debugDumpApp();
     }
     ```

     This will print the entire widget tree to the console, which can help you identify the problematic widget.
