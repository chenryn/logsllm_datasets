Sometimes I got this message:
> The following assertion was thrown during a scheduler callback:  
>  Child with id 73 is invisible and should not be added to the tree.  
>  'package:flutter/src/semantics/semantics.dart': Failed assertion: line 671
> pos 16:  
>  '!child.isInvisible'
How can I debug this error? Is there any way to dump all widgets from the
tree?
