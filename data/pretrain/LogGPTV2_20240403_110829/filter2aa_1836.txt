OLYMPIC-SIZED TRUNKING 
The 2002 Winter Olympic Games will begin on February 8, 2002, when 
more than two weeks of athletic events will take place in and around Salt
Lake City, Utah. An estimated one and a half million spectators are
expected to attend the Games. As you might imagine, radio will play a big
part in the rapid, smooth and safe functioning of each event. This month I'll
try to describe the major trunked radio networks that will be operating
during the Olympics.
As they have done many times in the past for such large events, the Federal
Communications Commission has delegated the task of radio frequency management and
coordination for the Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) will be the
coordinator from December 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002, for the areas in and around
Olympic activities. All broadcasters planning to work in one or more of the four radio zones
(Salt Lake City, Park City, Ogden and Provo) are required to coordinate their use of radio
frequencies through SLOC in order to operate any wireless audio and video, data
communication, two-way or other radio equipment.

Olympic Safety
Besides broadcasters, public safety personnel will be very busy as well.
The federal government has allocated about $200 million for security at the Olympic Winter
Games, with the potential for more after the events of September 11. In addition, the State of
Utah has contributed $35 million and the SLOC budget has more than $30 million earmarked for
safety.
The Secret Service is the lead agency for security planning. The FBI is tasked with intelligence
gathering and law enforcement response, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) is responsible for "consequence management," meaning they clean up if anything goes
wrong. At the state level, the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command (UOPSC) is responsible for
coordinating the activities of state and local law enforcement.
All told, there will be on the order of 5,000 to 7,000 law enforcement officers at the Games,
along with several thousand additional security personnel hired through SLOC. Military
personnel will also be on hand to provide assistance, so there should be a great deal of public
safety radio activity.
SLOC, in concert with the State of Utah and the Utah Communications Agency Network
(UCAN) has established a plan for their radio system. More than 7,000 two-way radios are
expected to be in use, operating in either the 150 MHz or 800 MHz bands for both short range
(within an event venue) and more distant communication.
Utah Communications Agency Network (UCAN)

UCAN is a quasi-governmental agency created by the Utah State Legislature in 1997 to
construct and operate a modern radio system on behalf of numerous state, local and private
safety organizations. The idea is to transition these users away from older, incompatible systems
in the 150 MHz and 450 MHz bands to a common 800 MHz trunked radio network.
Funding for the roll-out of the system comes from Federal grants, the state coffers, and monthly
user fees of anywhere from $15 to $30 per radio, depending on whether the user is a state agency
or not. In addition, last year Congress approved $5 million for UCAN to upgrade security and
communications equipment for use by law enforcement during the Olympics. Interestingly, the
funding bill also included money to build and operate field-transportable radio direction finding
equipment.
Phase I of the UCAN master plan provides for coverage in Davis, Morgan, Salt Lake, Summit,
Tooele, Utah, Wasatch, and Weber counties, which amounts to about 80 percent of Utah's
population.
Valley Emergency Communications Center
Southwest of Salt Lake City in West Valley City is the Valley Emergency Communications
Center (VECC), which provides dispatch services for 15 fire departments and 8 law enforcement
agencies. 9-1-1 calls from about 20 different municipalities across a 120-square-mile area are
answered at the VECC, averaging 3,500 calls each day. VECC is also the headquarters for
UCAN.
Besides voice, VECC provides data services to police, fire, and rescue units using Cellular
Digital Packet Data (CDPD) technology. Laptop units in vehicles are connected to CDPD
modems and are able to access public safety databases, letting officers run license checks and
warrant requests without the need to talk with a dispatcher.
Future plans include "voiceless dispatch" in which assignments are done over the CDPD
connection rather than by voice. This would free up officers and dispatchers from having to
handle routine messages and allow more information about the assignment to be delivered to the
officer in less time. Information such as mug shots, fingerprints, and photographs could be
delivered at the time of dispatch, allowing the officer to be better prepared for the assignment.
Rather than requiring new base station equipment, the CDPD service uses the existing cellular
telephone network. A vehicle can be equipped with a laptop and CDPD modem for less than
$1800, and monthly service charges from the cellular provider are about $50.
UCAN SmartZone
The UCAN network is a Motorola Type II SmartZone system with a number of sites. Sites are
grouped together into cells, with transmissions being simulcast from each site in a cell. This is a
rather large and complex system, with a lot of frequencies. What follows is a compilation of the
first eleven cells, which handle the majority of calls.
Weber County (cell 1): 866.950, 867.275, 867.300, 867.5875, 867.6125, 867.900, 867.925,

867.7750, 868.0375, 868.4375 and 868.9375 MHz.
Salt Lake City fire talkgroups include 832, 864 and 896 while County fire uses 928, 960, 972,
976 and 992. Medical rescue talkgroups are 1408 and 1440.
Salt Lake City police use talkgroups 672, 704, 720, 736, 768 and 800. County Sheriff calls
appear on a number of talkgroups, including 240, 272, 304, 336, 432, and 416. SWAT and
Special Operations use 608 and 640.
Salt Lake City, Utah
Salt Lake City operates a Motorola Type I system. TrunkTracker listeners should use Fleetmap
E1 P3. Frequencies are 856.7625, 856.9625, 857.7625, 857.9625, 858.7625, 858.9625, 859.7625,
859.9625, 860.7625 and 860.9625 MHz.
Since UCAN, Salt Lake County and Salt Lake City all use Motorola 800 MHz trunked radio
systems, there is a proposal in the works to use a SmartZone OmniLink switch to tie them all
together. This would also allow Department of Justice and Department of the Treasury wireless
networks to be linked in.
Salt Lake City Airport
The Salt Lake City airport runs a Motorola Type II system using frequencies of 856.4875,
856.9875, 857.4625, 857.4875, 858.4875, 859.2375, 859.4875, 860.2375 and 860.4875 MHz.
Talkgroups 1200 and 1360 are used by the Salt Lake City Fire Department, while 528, 530, and
1136 are assigned to the airport medical rescue units. Airport Police are dispatched on talkgroups
592 and 1232 while Operations uses 848 and 880.
Latter-Day Saints Church
Salt Lake City may be best known as the headquarters of the Latter-Day Saints (LDS) Church,
better known as the Mormons. They operate their own Motorola trunked radio system using the
frequencies 855.2625, 855.3375, 855.5625, 856.8375, 857.8375, 858.8375, 859.8375 and
860.8375 MHz.
Orem, Utah
The city of Orem in Utah County is licensed to operate a Motorola Type II system on the
following frequencies: 866.2250, 866.4250, 866.4500, 866.6250, 866.8375, 866.8875, 867.0875,
867.1375, 867.2375, 867.2875, 867.4875, 867.5750, 867.7250, 867.8875, 867.9375, 868.2875,
868.4250, 868.6125, 868.6250 and 868.9000 MHz. Note that some of these frequencies overlap
with UCAN assignments. Could a Utah reader confirm that the Orem system has been absorbed
by UCAN?
Provo, Utah
The city of Provo, also in Utah County, has the following frequencies assigned for a Motorola
Type II system: 851.8125, 852.3875, 854.8875, 855.2625, 855.3375, 855.5375, 855.5625,
855.8125, 856.3875, 856.8625, 856.9125, 857.9125, 858.2125, 858.8875, 858.9125, 859.9375,

859.8875, 859.9125, 860.8875, 860.9125, 861.1375 and 865.1875 MHz. The system may also be
absorbed by UCAN.
Hill Air Force Base
Hill Air Force Base in Davis county operates their own Motorola Type II system in the 400 MHz
band. The system follows the UHF standard of 25 kHz steps and has a base frequency of 406.000
MHz. Actual frequencies in use are 406.150, 406.750, 407.250, 407.525, 408.025, 408.550,
408.950, 409.150, 409.750 and 406.2500 MHz.
The base fire department has been heard on talkgroup 10720 while flightline operations is on
9760.
Tooele, Utah
Perhaps reduced in size by now, the world's largest single stockpile of chemical weapons is
located 45 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in a town called Tooele (pronounced too-ELL-ah)
at the Army's Desert Chemical Depot. Since 1996 Tooele's mission has been to safely incinerate
the thousands of tons of U.S. chemical weapons.
The depot is reported to operate a five-channel Motorola Type II system on the following UHF
frequencies: 406.350, 407.150, 407.950, 408.750 and 409.550 MHz.
Computerized Talkgroup Logging
While scanning trunked frequencies, it is often a manual chore to write down each talkgroup that
appears on the scanner display. A MT reader just might have the solution for this problem.
Dan,
I am a MT subscriber and I enjoy reading your Tracking the Trunks section. I
have written a program for the Bearcat 245XLT and 780XLT scanners that
may be of interest to your readers. I am a programmer by profession but I
also write my own software as part of my radio hobby.
I originally wrote the program for my own use to collect new IDs for my web
page. I decided to release it as freeware so that others may get some use
from it. The software can be found at:
http://personal.lig.bellsouth.net/lig/k/d/kd5eis/IDTracker/IDTracker.htm
David, K5DMH
Baton Rouge, LA
David's software runs under Microsoft Windows and requires a serial connection to either a
Bearcat 245XLT or a 780XLT. Talkgroup IDs from Motorola or EDACS systems are displayed
and optionally logged to a disk file. His web page has comprehensive explanations of the
program's features and an easy-to-use download section.
That's all for this month. I welcome your electronic mail messages at dan @ 
signalharbor.com, and there is more information on my web site at
www.signalharbor.com. Until next time, happy monitoring!
