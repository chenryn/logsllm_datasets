Device policy using Customer-per-Device (real
traﬃc) metering (CI – Customer-Ingress, CD –
Customer-per-Device).
Summary and implications:
The level at which the
backbone operator meters the traﬃc of the customers has
a large impact on the quantiﬁed costs. Based on the me-
dians, the most and the least accurate policies diverge by
80%. Therefore, the backbone operators should apply so-
phisticated metering strategies (e.g., network-wide deploy-
ment of NetFlow-capable traﬃc monitoring devices) in order
to accurately quantify the costs of the customers. Moreover,
the simple methods are no longer aligned with the real cost
of the customers (i.e., with the Aggregate-Peak-Customer
policy) if the traﬃc is metered on the ingress links. From
an accuracy point of view, this implies that backbone op-
erators should reconsider the pricing of IP transit services,
which they currently price based on simpler policies such as
the 95Percentile one.
5.3 L-discrepancies
Next, we focus on the L-discrepancies. Out of the three
policies described in Section 3.3, one, the Trigger policy,
requires historic information on customer arrival events as
well as customer traﬃc information on long time scales that
relate to network upgrade events. Since we do not have full
historic information on all the links, we approximate the
Trigger policy as follows. We assume for each customer he
was the last one arriving to the network. Then we compute
the marginal cost contribution of the customer as the actual
cost of the device minus the cost of the device without the
traﬃc of the customer. Formally, we quantify the marginal
contribution of customer i as:
ml
i = C#max
t∈T $j∈N
xl
j (t)% − Cmax
t∈T $j∈N\{i}
xl
j (t) (15)
Finally, we allocate the cost of the device to the customers
in proportion to their marginal contributions:
i = cl ·
cl
ml
i&j∈N ml
j
In the following, we refer to this method as Trigger*.

Aggregate-Peak-Device+CI policies with the nominally ac-
curate one, namely, the Aggregate-Peak-Device+CD pol-
icy. The results are summarized in Table 4. The Volume-
Customer policy has the smallest M-discrepancy, that is, the
median ratio of the Customer-Ingress and the Customer-per-
Device costs is 1.5. On the contrary, the Aggregate-Peak-
Device policy yields the largest M-discrepancies. The rea-
son behind this is twofold. First, when metering traﬃc at
the ingress links, traﬃc that results in peaks at individual
links does not result in peaks of the aggregate ingress traf-
ﬁc. Second, under Customer-Ingress, the Aggregate-Peak-
Device policy takes into account only the time interval with
the largest aggregate traﬃc while the peaks of the internal
devices may happen in other time intervals neglected by the
Aggregate-Peak-Device+CI policy. We observe that under
the Aggregate-Peak-Device+CI combination, the costs di-
verge by at least 25% for 76% of the customers. In addition
we note that under the Volume-Customer+CI policy and
metering, the discrepancy can be as high as 32.

Table 5: Device-level L-discrepancies compared to
the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy.
5.3.1 Device-level L-discrepancies
We present the L-discrepancies in Table 5 by computing
the ratio between X∈ [Trigger*,Shapley] and the Aggregate-
Peak-Device policy. L-discrepancies are quite high (ratios up
to 1180) pointing to the fact that liability can bias signiﬁ-
cantly the cost-sharing picture that a telco has. For example,
if we compute costs based on the Trigger* and based on the
Aggregate-Peak-Device policy, the gap between the two is
very large: in more than 85% of the cases the L-discrepancy
is larger than 25%. The Trigger* policy allocates the cost
in a full-liability fashion, while the Aggregate-Peak-Device
policy applies a proportional liability scheme. Our empiri-
cal results conﬁrm that the Shapley policy, which estimates
the customers’ average contribution to the capacity upgrade
considering every possible arriving order,
lies in between
these two extremes. Again, the diﬀerence between the costs
of the Shapley and the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy is sub-
stantial: the median ratio of the costs is 1.5; however, in
some cases the ratio can be larger than 400.
We further examine the L-discrepancy between the
Aggregate-Peak-Device and the Shapley policies. In Fig. 9
we plot the L-discrepancies for all customers and all links as
a function of the traﬃc volumes, which the customers had
on the particular device in the analyzed time period. The
magnitude of the L-discrepancy is inversely proportional
to the traﬃc volumes. Thus, smaller customers tend
to have larger L-discrepancies. Small customers usually
do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the peak utilization of the
devices, i.e., they have some marginal share of the costs.
However, they may trigger a capacity upgrade of the link
and therefore have a larger share of the costs because of
the link’s step-based cost function. The ﬁgure also reveals
that whether the Shapley policy over- or under-estimates
the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy’ costs is not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by the customers’ traﬃc volume or by the
magnitude of their L-discrepancies.
We present in Fig. 10 a part of the time-series of a cus-
tomer with a large L-discrepancy (3.25) along with the ag-
gregate time-series of the other customers who utilize the
same link. The dashed horizontal lines denote the traﬃc vol-
umes where the capacity of the link needs to be upgraded.
The traﬃc of the customer is small enough to be transmit-
ted over a link with lower capacity. However, the traﬃc of
the other customers pushes the link to have larger capac-
ity and thus larger cost. The Shapley policy considers this
fact when it computes the average marginal contribution of
the customer. As a result, the cost of the customer is less
than if we compute it based solely on time of the largest
utilization of the device. On the contrary, the Aggregate-
Peak-Customer focuses only on the time-interval when the
link has its aggregate peak. The particular customer has
signiﬁcant share of the aggregate peak and thus of the cost
of the link according to the Aggregate-Peak-Customer. This
however masks who is responsible for the link’s larger capac-
ity. However, this single time-interval masks the fact that

the speciﬁc customer is not responsible for the link’s needing
a larger capacity.
5.3.2 Network-level L-discrepancies
We show the network-level L-discrepancies in Table 6. At
the network level, the number and the magnitude of the
L-discrepancies is smaller than at the device level. Never-
theless, for more than 50% of the customers the costs are oﬀ
by at least 25%. The median L-discrepancies of the policies
are notable too, e.g., 1.3 under the Shapley policy.
Summary and implications: The liability of network up-
grades plays an important role in the quantiﬁcation of the
costs of customers in backbone networks. The median value
of L-discrepancies is at least 1.3 while the L-discrepancies
impact more than half of the customers with at least 25%.
The implication of the results is that if the backbone network
is not built in one-shot but is rather organically grown and
upgraded then the Aggregate-Peak-Customer policy may in-
duce cross-subsidization problems: customers may be ac-
counted for costs of upgrades for which they are not li-
able (or not in that degree). From a customer point of
view, this cross-subsidization may not be tolerated in a long-
run given the competitive environment of the backbone net-
works. That is the customers may select other backbone
network operator where they are not liable for the costs
of others. From the operator point of view, the large L-
discrepancies dictate that he needs to take them under se-
rious consideration. If it is anticipated that the market for
backbone services will be healthy, the operator should choose
the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy.
If however, he expects
diﬃculties in selling its capacity, our results indicate that
Shapley should be the policy of choice.

costs of the customers based on uniform vs. diverse
link costs
5.4 TCO-discrepancies
In this section we take into account that our dataset con-
tains a geographically distributed set of links with diverse
costs as we introduced in Section 4. We compute the TCO-
discrepancies by computing the ratio between the customers’
costs given links with uniform and diverse costs. In Fig. 11
we illustrate the TCO-discrepancies under the Aggregate-
Peak-Device policy. Each customer is aﬀected by the TCO-
discrepancies. The diﬀerence between the two costs can be
as high as 5% of the cost of the entire network.
We report the quantiﬁed TCO-discrepancies of ﬁve poli-
cies in Table 7. The results show generally extreme TCO-
discrepancies; some customers have TCO-discrepancies as
high as 900. In addition, 80% of the customers are assigned
25% higher or lower cost when the diverse costs of the links
is considered. The Shapley value is aﬀected the least based
on the medians of the TCO-discrepancies.
Summary and implications:
TCO-discrepancies have
a very large impact on the costs of the customers. The
median ratio of the customers’ costs is as high as a factor
of four. Similar to the L-discrepancies, cross-subsidization
problems arise if the impact of TCO diﬀerences is neglected.
Backbone operators are aware of the fact that diﬀerent parts
of their network have diﬀerent TCOs. The implication of our
results is that this diversity should also be reﬂected in the

the tariﬀs too, based on which customers are charged.
5.5 Sensitivity analysis
We investigate the robustness of the cost-sharing policies
from two additional angles. First, we quantify the costs
of the customers for time-series with 5-minute, 30-minute,
and 2-hour intervals. We compare the network-level costs
of the methods to the Aggregate-Peak-Device policy in Ta-
ble 8, where the two policies are compared based on the same
time interval. The results reveal that all the policies are af-
fected equally, i.e., the duration of the time-interval does
not introduce additional discrepancies among the schemes.
For example, the median ratios of the costs based on the
Volume-Customer and the Aggregate-Peak-Device policies
are 1.261, 1.261, and 1.251 in the case of the datasets with
5-minute, 30-minute, and 2-hour intervals, respectively.
Second, backbone operators apply diﬀerent utilization
thresholds at which they upgrade the capacity of their
devices. We compute the costs of the customers in the case
