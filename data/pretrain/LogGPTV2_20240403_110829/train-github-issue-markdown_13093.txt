I am using some type definitions that follow the pattern below and that have
been compiling up until commit `d71af8a`
    declare module MyModule {
      class Foo extends Foo.__Class {}
      module Foo {
        class __Class {
          constructor(x: number, y: number);
        }
      }
    }
After commit `d71af8a` I'm getting errors like  
`error TS2506: 'Foo' is referenced directly or indirectly in its own base
expression.`
