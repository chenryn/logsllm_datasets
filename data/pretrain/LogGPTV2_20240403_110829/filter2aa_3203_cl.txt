### Collection and Distribution Process

When domains are split across multiple routers, each subnet conducts its own browse server elections. Each subnet functions as an independent browsing entity, with its own Master Browse Server (MBS) and Backup Browse Servers (BBS).

#### Responsibilities of the Master Browse Server
Each MBS in a subnet collects the following information:
1. **List of Servers in Its Domain**: By listening for Host Announcement packets from computers within its domain.
2. **List of Other LAN Groups and Their MBSs**: By listening for Domain Announcement or Workgroup Announcement packets from the MBSs of other LAN groups.

If all servers in the domain were on a single subnet, the Domain MBS would also be the MBS for that domain. In configurations like Figure C-3, the Domain MBS is attached to only one subnet. To facilitate the flow of information across the IPv4 router, MBSs on other subnets must communicate with the Domain MBS. This communication occurs in two forms:
1. **Updates from MBSs to the Domain MBS**: MBSs send their collected lists of servers and other LAN groups.
2. **Downloads from the Domain MBS to MBSs**: MBSs download the comprehensive browse list from the Domain MBS, which includes all server names within the domain and all other LAN group names.

The result is that each MBS receives the Domain MBS's browse list. The BBSs on each subnet then download this list from their local MBS.

#### Communication Mechanisms
Communication between MBSs and the Domain MBS occurs periodically through unicast IPv4 traffic. The MBS for each subnet contacts the Domain MBS to exchange information. The MBS resolves the IPv4 address of the Domain MBS using either:
- **WINS**: If the MBS is a WINS client, it queries its WINS servers for the NetBIOS name `Domain[1B]`, which is registered only by the Domain MBS.
- **Lmhosts File**: The MBS can use special entries in the Lmhosts file to locate the Domain MBS. Details of these entries are discussed in the "Configuring the Lmhosts File for a Domain that Spans IPv4 Routers" section.

### Servicing Browse Client Requests

When servicing browse client requests, the client can request:
1. **List of Servers Within Its Domain or a LAN Group on Its Subnet**:
   - The browse client broadcasts a `Get Backup List Request` packet to the NetBIOS name `LANGroup[1D]`.
   - The MBS for the LAN group on the clientâ€™s subnet responds with a list of computer names for BBSs.
   - The client randomly selects one BBS and contacts it directly for the list of servers within the LAN group.

2. **List of Servers Within Another LAN Group on Another Subnet**:
   - This process is described in the "Multiple Domains Across IPv4 Routers" section.

3. **List of Shares on a Server**:
   - The browse client resolves the NetBIOS name for the Server service on the desired computer (`ComputerName[20]`).
   - A TCP session, a NetBIOS session, and an SMB session are created between the browse client and the server.
   - The list of shares is sent over the SMB session.

### Configuring the Lmhosts File for a Domain that Spans IPv4 Routers

To enable direct communication between MBSs on remote subnets and the Domain MBS for computers not using WINS, you must configure the Lmhosts file with the NetBIOS names and IPv4 addresses of the browse server computers.

Each entry in the Lmhosts file should include:
- **IPv4 Address and Computer Name of the Domain Controller**
- **Domain Name Preceded by the #PRE #DOM: Tags**

Example entry:
```
131.107.7.80 DC100 #PRE #DOM:EXAMPLE
```

This entry indicates that the domain controller for the `EXAMPLE` domain is a computer named `DC100` at the IPv4 address `131.107.7.80`.

By adding entries for all domain controllers, the Lmhosts files do not need to be changed if the Domain MBS changes. When multiple Lmhosts entries exist for the same domain, a Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 MBS determines the correct Domain MBS by querying each IPv4 address. Only the Domain MBS responds to the query.

### Multiple Domains Separated by IPv4 Routers

In configurations where multiple domains are separated by an IPv4 router, the following processes are examined:
- **Collection and Distribution Process**
- **Servicing Browse Client Requests**

#### Collection and Distribution Process
Besides collecting servers in its domain, an MBS also collects the names of other LAN groups on its subnet. This information is sent to the Domain MBS and distributed to other MBSs in the domain. Browse clients within the domain see a comprehensive list of all collected LAN groups.

**Enhancement with WINS**:
- A WINS-enabled Domain MBS periodically queries the WINS server to obtain a list of all domains from the WINS database.
- The Domain MBS queries WINS for all NetBIOS names ending with `0x1B` (NetBIOS domain names registered by Domain MBSs).
- The Domain MBS sends a NetBIOS Adapter Status message to each IPv4 address corresponding to the NetBIOS name `Domain[1B]` to complete its list of domain names and their corresponding Domain MBSs.

This process ensures the Domain MBS has a list of all domains, including those on remote subnets not spanned by its domain.

#### Servicing WINS-enabled Client Requests for Remote Domains

When a WINS client requests a list of servers from a different domain:
1. The client broadcasts a `Get Backup List Request` packet to the NetBIOS name `LANGroup[1D]` to get a list of BBSs from a local MBS.
2. If no response is received, the client queries the WINS server for the IPv4 address of the Domain MBS using the NetBIOS name `Domain[1B]`.
3. If the WINS query is successful, the client sends a unicast `Get Backup List Request` packet to the Domain MBS.
4. The Domain MBS responds with a list of BBSs. The client selects one BBS and uses a WINS query to get the IPv4 address of the selected BBS.
5. The client connects to the BBS and requests a list of servers in the domain.
6. The BBS returns the list of servers to the client.

If the WINS query fails, the client follows a similar process but uses the local MBS to get the name of the remote MBS and then resolves the NetBIOS name of the remote MBS to connect and request the list of servers.

### Servicing Non-WINS Client Requests for Remote Domains

For non-WINS clients, the process is:
1. The client broadcasts a `Get Backup List Request` packet to the NetBIOS name `Domain[1D]` and a NetBIOS name query for `Domain[1B]`.
2. If no response is received, the client connects to its local MBS and requests the name of the MBS of the desired domain.
3. The local MBS returns the name of the MBS that advertised the domain.
4. The client resolves the NetBIOS name of the remote MBS and connects to it to request a list of servers in the domain.
5. The remote MBS returns the list of servers to the client.

### Workgroups Spanning an IPv4 Router

A workgroup spanning an IPv4 router creates two separate workgroups. There is no mechanism to propagate the list of servers collected by the MBS on one subnet to the MBS on another subnet. Workgroup MBSs do not register a special NetBIOS name with WINS, and there are no special Lmhosts entries for forwarding unicast workgroup browse list information.

The only way to have browse clients see all servers in the workgroup on both sides of the router is to enable the forwarding of NetBIOS over TCP/IP broadcasts or to upgrade the workgroup to a domain. However, enabling broadcast forwarding is highly discouraged.

### Multiple Workgroups Separated by IPv4 Routers

Workgroup MBSs cannot advertise themselves beyond their own subnet. Domains, however, can advertise themselves beyond their subnet using the `Domain[1B]` NetBIOS name registered by the Domain MBS with WINS. This difference can lead to confusing results.

In a configuration with multiple workgroups and a domain spanning subnets, the browse list for clients in the domain will include:
- The domain and all its servers.
- Other workgroups and their MBSs.

However, for clients in a workgroup, the browse list will only include:
- The workgroup and its servers.
- The domain.

Other workgroups on different subnets will not appear in the browse list due to the lack of mechanisms for propagating workgroup information across subnets.

### Stranded Workgroup Problem

The existence of a workgroup is stranded to its subnet and to domains that span its subnet. Only workgroups on the same subnet and domains that span the subnet will see the workgroup in their browse lists. The solution to the stranded workgroup problem is to enable the forwarding of NetBIOS over TCP/IP broadcasts on IP routers (highly discouraged) or to upgrade the workgroups to domains.

This issue is typically not a concern for large organizations that use domains for logical grouping and security infrastructure.
