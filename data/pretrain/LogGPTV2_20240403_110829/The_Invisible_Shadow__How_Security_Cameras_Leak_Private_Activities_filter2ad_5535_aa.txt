ABSTRACT
This paper presents a new privacy threat, the Invisible Infrared
Shadow Attack (IRSA), which leverages the inconspicuous infrared
(IR) light emitted by indoor security cameras, to reveal in-home
human activities behind opaque curtains. The key observation is
that the in-home IR light source can project invisible shadows on
the window curtains, which can be captured by an attacker out-
side using an IR-capable camera. The major challenge for IRSA
lies in the shadow deformation caused by a variety of environ-
mental factors involving the IR source position and curtain shape,
which distorts the body contour. A two-stage attack scheme is
proposed to circumvent the challenge. Specifically, a DeShaNet
model performs accurate shadow keypoint detection through multi-
dimension feature fusion. Then a scene constructor maps the 2D
shadow keypoints to 3D human skeletons by iteratively reproduc-
ing the on-site shadow projection process in a virtual Unity 3D
environment. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that
the proposed attack scheme can be successfully launched to recover
3D skeleton of the victims, even under severe shadow deformation.
Finally, we propose potential defense mechanisms against the IRSA.

1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past a few years, smart security cameras have been quickly
emerging as a critical element in the smart-home ecosystem. Ac-
cording to market research, around 38% American homes own at
least one security camera [29], more than 40% of which are deployed
indoor. The market size of security camera has reached $3.6 billion
as of 2020, and will surge to $11.6 billion in the next 6 years [29].
The security cameras have been playing a crucial role in monitoring
kids, pets, appliance safety, and in protecting against crimes.
Whereas users may trust such devices’ promise to keep the
video records secure, they may not be aware that these devices
are acting as an infrared (IR) light source, which can create a side
channel to leak user privacy. In this paper, we investigate a novel
attack that makes this possible. Fig. 1 showcases a typical attack
scenario. Most security cameras have a night vision mode [1, 5],
when they illuminate the target scene with a built-in IR LED to
aid low-light video capture. The IR light can easily penetrate thin
opaque materials such as window curtains made of cotton and viole
which are used to block visible light. Thus, when a home resident
stays in between the camera and window, the IR light can project
the resident’s shadow on an opaque curtain. Though invisible to
human eyes, the shadows can be captured by an attacker outside
the home using an IR camera. Now that the IR shadows become
visible video footage, they can reveal private information such as
health/medical conditions, special hobbies, and intimacy between
residents. We refer to such an attack as IR shadow attack (IRSA).
There are two major challenges to carry out the IRSA in reality.
First, the IR shadow may be deformed by multiple unpredictable
environmental factors, which severely disturb the visual features,
making it hard to identify the body contours. These factors in-
clude the IR light source’s projection angle, the distance between
IR source and the curtain, and the irregular curtain surface due to
deformation. We refer to these factors as scene parameters. One
possible solution is to fine-tune and apply existing human body
keypoint detection models [11] on the shadow images. However,
the scene parameters cause huge diversity on the shadow defor-
mation, which will easily fail existing models. To overcome this
challenge, we design a shadow keypoint detection model called
De-Shadow Network (DeShaNet). DeShaNet incorporates a scene
feature fusion module to learn the scene parameters that cause

skeleton from 2D shadow keypoints, in spite of unknown
scene parameters such as distance/angle of the IR source
relative to the (deformed) curtain.
• We implement the DeShaNet and scene constructor schemes
and conduct extensive experiments to validate the feasibility
of IRSA. Our evaluation also reveals limitations of the IRSA
and hints to possible defense mechanisms.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Characteristics of the IR light
The IR light is a kind of electromagnetic wave with a wavelength
of 760nm-1000nm, which is imperceptible by human eyes. But the
modern photosensitive chips used in cameras have a much wider
range of wavelengths, which enables them to capture the IR as well
as visible light. Therefore, the IR light is widely used for auxiliary
lighting on surveillance cameras, which grants night vision for the
cameras without affecting human. However, for normal smartphone
cameras, manufacturers usually insert the IR light filter to reduce
glare from the IR spectrum [38]. Another important property of
the IR light is the penetration ability. Prior work found that the IR
camera can see through cloth, such as T-shirt [45] and clothes[44].
All in all, the invisibility and the penetrability provide necessary
conditions for the IR shadow attack.
2.2 Attack model and assumptions
In IRSA, we assume the victims are located between the IR source
(e.g., the security camera) and a window with curtains. The IR
source casts invisible IR light on the victims and projects their
body contours on the curtains. The projected IR shadows are then
recorded by the IR camera of an attacker outside the victim’s win-
dow. Due to various scene parameters, e.g, curtain deformation and
abnormal IR angle, the recorded shadows are deformed, making it
hard to infer the victim’s activities directly.
Two requirements are necessary for IRSA to succeed. First, the
IR illumination should last long enough, so that the attacker can
observe the victim’s activities continuously through the invisible
shadow and eventually impinge on her privacy. Second, majority
of the shadows should be projected on the window curtain, which
provides opportunities for the attacker outside to capture the shad-
ows and infer private activities. In what follows, we discuss the
likelihood that these requirements are satisfied in practice, and the
corresponding victim population.
2.3 Potential victim population
We now discuss the practical vulnerability factors related to IRSA,
and empirically estimate the victim population.
Global sales volume of smart cameras. According to a re-
search report from Strategy Analytics [33], the global sales volume
of smart cameras was 56 million in 2019, and will increase with an
annual growth rate of around 20%. As of 2021, the sales volume is
around 80 million. Suppose every household consists of 2 users on
average, then around 160 million users will be using smart cameras
in their homes.
IR Angle. We analyze the 10 best-selling smart cameras ranked
by sales volume on two major online retailers [3, 16]. Their average
infrared radiation angle is about 120◦ (both horizontal and vertical).
Figure 1: An example showcase of the invisible IR shadow at-
tack. A smart home camera emits IR light and projects the
contours of a couple’s bodies onto the curtain while they are
kissing inside, which are then captured by another smart
home camera outside the window. Through the leaked IR
shadow, anyone can clearly observe the private activities of
the victim couple.
shadow deformation. With an explicit representation of the scene
parameters, it recovers the 2D shadow keypoints even under severe
deformation. Additionally, it incorporates a conditional attention
module to increase the detection robustness by automatically evalu-
ating the environment factors and fusing multi-dimensional feature
vectors, e.g., the shadow deformation and movement intensity.
Second, the shadow deformation weakens the geometric relation
between the 2D shadow keypoint positions and 3D body skele-
ton in most cases, making it hard to infer the victims’ activities
merely from the shadow. We thus introduce a scene constructor
scheme, which consists of a scene parameter estimator (SCE) and a
shadow simulator, to explicitly model the scene parameters. The
SCE reverse-engineers 4 major scene parameters (the IR source
angle/distance, limb length and curtain deformation) by analyzing
the deformation characteristics of the shadow. Then, the shadow
simulator, which is essentially a 3D scene simulator, tries to iter-
atively reproduce the same deformed shadow by manipulating a
3D dummy in the corresponding virtual 3D environment. During
this process, the accurate 3D skeletons of the victim are derived as
a byproduct.
We have implemented the DeShaNet using Pytorch [27] and
the scene constructor using Unity 3D [37]. We collect a dataset of
24k video frames to train and test the attack scheme. The dataset
covers a variety of realistic situations, including different IR source
angles/distances, human subjects, security camera hardware, cur-
tain materials, dark/bright environment, etc. From the experiments,
we observe that the DeShaNet framework largely decreases the
shadow keypoint detection error compared with existing models.
Most importantly, the attack scheme can accurately restore the
subject’s 3D skeletons with only a few pixels’ error even under
severe shadow deformation.
To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the concept of
IRSA, and reveal the alarming privacy issues of security cameras
due to their invisible shadow effect. Our main contributions can be
summarized as follows:
• We propose the DeShaNet to detect shadow keypoints, even
when the shadows are severely distorted due to curtain de-
formation.

As a result, even if the smart cameras are positioned at arbitrary
horizontal angles within a windowed room, there is still 1/3 chance
of illuminating the window.
IR distance. The median housing area of all countries around
the world is about 1000 sq ft [23]. Considering that the most com-
mon house type is 2B1B with living room, the maximum distance
inside the house (the diagonal distance of a square house) with
an area of 1100 sq ft is less than 5 meters, and 70% of the interior
of the house with an area of 2200 sq ft is less than 5 meters. On
the other hand, the effective distance of the IR light can reach 5
meters, even for the low-profile camera used in our experiments,
and similarly for other commodity security cameras [42, 43]. High
end smart cameras may have an even longer range. Considering
the population distribution and housing area of each country [30],
94.5% of households have a maximum distance of less than 5 meters,
which meets the distance requirement of IRSA.
User habits. The smart cameras are typically used for moni-
toring pets, babies and identifying emergency. So they are usually
installed in the main areas of the house, such as bedrooms and
living rooms. So it is reasonable to assume that smart cameras can
capture a wide range of activities (including privacy sensitive ones),
and there is a non-trivial probability that the camera’s field of view
(FoV) covers a user and part of the window.
Private activity time. People’s private activities usually occur
after they return home at night, when the light intensity is low and
the infrared light tends to be triggered. According to existing tests
of smart cameras [42, 43], the IR light can be automatically triggered
even under the illumination of typical ceiling lights or desktop lamp,
i.e., the ambient environment does not have to be completely dark.
On the other hand, many private activities are performed at low
ambient illumination, such as masturbating, sexual intercourse, etc.
Overall, when the infrared light is triggered, it happens to be the
peak time of private activities.
Ratio of curtains/blinds. According to a survey of the global
window covering market [12], the ratio of curtains among all kinds
of window covers is over 30% in 2018. Therefore, we can assume
over 30% of homes use curtains as their window cover.
Based on the above analysis, we can gauge the number of people
vulnerable to IRSA. At present, at least 160 million users are engaged
with smart cameras at home. Consider the attrition factors, i.e.,
IR distance (94.5%), IR Angle (33%), curtain/blinds ratio (30%), the
potential victim population of IRSA is about 160∗0.945∗0.33∗0.3 =
15 million, which is alarming and will grow over time as the smart
camera market expands.
2.4 Significance of the attack
How would people react when their activities at home are exposed
to others? In principle, the invisible IR shadow can reveal any kinds
of activities, after the 3D keypoints are recovered by the proposed
framework. According to the survey by Choe et al. [9], 1400 types
of in-home activities are considered private, and more than 39%
percent of respondents thought exposure of such activities would
make them feel extremely embarrassed and uncomfortable. We
note that some activities are not so obvious but considered private
by many people, e.g., eating (indicating unhealthy behavior espe-
cially when it lasts long), body twisting (associated with intimate
behavior for some people).
The shadow keypoints and 3D skeleton outputs from DeShaNet
can potentially leak more information than the activity alone. Exist-
ing studies [15, 28, 32, 40] have shown that human shadows reflect
walking gestures, which can be used to distinguish different people.
With sufficient video footage from public figures, the attacker can
train a model to associate the shadow records with the people iden-
tities, which poses a more severe privacy threat. Besides the smart
security cameras, other popular in-home devices such as Kinect
emit IR lights in a similar manner. Many other devices, such as
smart display or video call portal, do not have night-vision yet. But
they may incorporate this function in the near future and become
the vulnerable point for ISRA. Therefore, we believe the ISRA is an
alarming issue that should be investigated immediately.
3 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The proposed IRSA consists of two key steps, as shown in Fig. 2.
First, the attacker captures the IR video and feeds it into DeShaNet,
which extracts the keypoints of the (deformed) shadow for each
video frame. Second, the attacker uses the scene constructor to
map the keypoints to a 3D skeleton. More specifically, the scene
constructor estimates a set of scene parameters (SPEs) based on the
keypoint positions. It then employs a shadow simulator to imitate
the realistic shadow in this virtual scene by optimizing the 3D
skeleton layout. The final output of the system is the optimized 3D
skeleton, which can be used to extract private information such as
activity and identity [28, 40].

4 DESHANET DESIGN
4.1 Shadow Deformation Caused by Scene
Parameters
The shadow deformation can severely distort the IR shadow appear-
ance. We showcase the problem in Fig. 3. We identify 3 major scene
parameters causing the shadow deformation: curtain deformation,
IR angle and IR distance (i.e., angle/distance of the in-home security
camera relative to the curtain surface). In an ideal scenario where
the curtain is flat, the IR angle is 0◦ and distance is short (3m), the
attacker-captured IR shadow (Fig. 3(b)) is almost the same as the
ground-truth captured by an in-home camera (Fig. 3(a)).
Curtain deformation. Fig. 3(c,d) show two deformed shadows
with different curtain deformations: U-shape and vertical. We see
that the shadows are deformed obviously, especially on the small
body parts (hands and arms). If we can extract the features of the
projection surface (i.e., window curtain in this case) by observing
