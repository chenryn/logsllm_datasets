User: How do I find the playback time of media with gstreamer?
Assistant: Why re-invent the wheel?
Use:
    gst-discoverer-1.0 filename
or
    gst-discoverer-0.10 filename    
Depending on the file type you may want to add " | grep Duration" to avoid the tags which can be lengthy.
For the ridding of extraneous tags for video,flac and mp3 files this should do the trick by using grep to exclude them.
gst-discoverer-1.0 filename  | grep -v Tags | grep -v ID3v2 | grep -v image | grep -v attachment
