User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Need help detecting a flaw or vulnerability in a network Let's assume that my public IP address is A.B.C.D and I have a Linux server within my network that has the IP X.Y.Z.T and I have some port open in the X.Y.Z.T server but that same port is closed in my main router so that A.B.C.D:PORT can not be reached from an outside network.

The thing is that I have been attacked by someone that exploited my resource at X.Y.Z.T:PORT by accessing it through (according to my server's logs) A.B.C.D:PORT

Logically A.B.C.D:PORT cold not be accessed from outside my network since the port is closed and the attacker's IP has no NAT address inside my network. So my question is how can something like this happen ?

Please understand that I don't expect a full answer to that, I just need some clues where to start looking (I'm a complete beginner in networks).

Assistant: Simple answer: 
Start sniffing your network and discover what is happening. After this work with what you'd seen. 

Sources, destinations, packets entering, packets leaving and possibly their content. It's all there if you can catch. 

Sniffing your network and understanding how this connection is being stablished without suppositions is the key to solve your problem, so you can start working on what's really happening.

Discover how it's leaving your network and drop it.
