Challenge use-a-google-font has an issue.
Similarly to #13463, there are two versions of this challenge, one in Basic
CSS (the original one) and one in Applied visual design (this one was added
with the new curriculum).
Actually both have a good description, I think the best thing would be to
merge the two challenges to have only one on the subject, rather than just
deleting one.
