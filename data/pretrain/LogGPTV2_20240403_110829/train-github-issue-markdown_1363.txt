There is an issue with the "use-a-google-font" challenge. Similar to issue #13463, there are two versions of this challenge: one in Basic CSS (the original) and another in Applied Visual Design (which was added with the new curriculum).

Both versions have well-written descriptions. Instead of simply deleting one, I recommend merging the two challenges into a single, comprehensive challenge on the topic. This approach would provide a more cohesive and streamlined learning experience.
