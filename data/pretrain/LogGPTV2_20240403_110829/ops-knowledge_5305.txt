User: I am running some calculations in an external machine and at the end I get X, Y pairs. I want to apply linear regression and obtain A, B, and R2. In this machine I can not install anything (it runs Linux) and has basic stuff installed on it, python, bash (of course), etc.
I wonder what would be the best approach to use a script (python, bash, etc) or program (I can compile C and C++) that gives me the linear regression coefficients without the need to add external libraries (numpy, etc)
Assistant: How about extracting the coeffs into a file, import to another machine and then use Excel/Matlab/whatever other program that does this for you?
