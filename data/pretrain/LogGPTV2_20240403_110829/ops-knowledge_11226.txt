It seems like you're trying to create a simple Python script using the `xmpppy` library to send a message over Facebook Chat. Below is an optimized and more professional version of your code, along with some additional advice on how to resolve the issues you are encountering.

### Optimized Code

```python
import xmpp

# Constants
FACEBOOK_ID = "username@chat.facebook.com"
PASSWORD = "password"
SERVER = "chat.facebook.com"
FRIEND_JID = "friend@chat.facebook.com"
MESSAGE = "Hello world"

# Create JID (Jabber ID)
jid = xmpp.protocol.JID(FACEBOOK_ID)

# Initialize the client
client = xmpp.Client(jid.getDomain(), debug=[])

# Connect to the server
if not client.connect((SERVER, 5222)):
    raise IOError('Cannot connect to the server.')

# Authenticate with the server
if not client.auth(jid.getNode(), PASSWORD):
    raise IOError('Cannot authenticate with the server.')

# Send the message
client.send(xmpp.protocol.Message(FRIEND_JID, MESSAGE))
```

### Troubleshooting and Advice

1. **DNS Resolution Error**:
   - The error `An error occurred while looking up _xmpp-client._tcp.chat.facebook.com` suggests that there might be a DNS resolution issue. Ensure that your system's DNS settings are correct and that you have an active internet connection.
   - You can try using a different DNS server, such as Google's public DNS (8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4).

2. **Host Unknown Error**:
   - The `HostUnknown` error typically indicates that the server name in the JID is incorrect. Make sure that the `FACEBOOK_ID` is in the correct format and that the domain (`chat.facebook.com`) is correct.
   - Also, ensure that the username part of the `FACEBOOK_ID` is in lowercase, as Facebook usernames are case-sensitive.

3. **Deprecation Warnings**:
   - The deprecation warnings for `sha` and `md5` modules indicate that these modules are outdated. The `xmpppy` library you are using is quite old and may not be maintained. Consider using a more modern XMPP library, such as `sleekxmpp` or `aioxmpp`.
   - If you still want to use `xmpppy`, you can suppress the deprecation warnings by adding the following lines at the beginning of your script:

     ```python
     import warnings
     warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning)
     ```

4. **Alternative Libraries**:
   - `sleekxmpp` is a more modern and actively maintained XMPP library for Python. Here is an example of how you can achieve the same functionality using `sleekxmpp`:

     ```python
     import sleekxmpp
     from sleekxmpp.exceptions import IqError, IqTimeout

     class SendMsgBot(sleekxmpp.ClientXMPP):
         def __init__(self, jid, password, recipient, message):
             sleekxmpp.ClientXMPP.__init__(self, jid, password)
             self.recipient = recipient
             self.msg = message
             self.add_event_handler("session_start", self.start)

         def start(self, event):
             self.send_presence()
             self.get_roster()
             self.send_message(mto=self.recipient, mbody=self.msg, mtype='chat')
             self.disconnect()

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         FACEBOOK_ID = "username@chat.facebook.com"
         PASSWORD = "password"
         FRIEND_JID = "friend@chat.facebook.com"
         MESSAGE = "Hello world"

         xmpp = SendMsgBot(FACEBOOK_ID, PASSWORD, FRIEND_JID, MESSAGE)
         xmpp.connect()
         xmpp.process(block=True)
     ```

### Conclusion

- Ensure that your `FACEBOOK_ID` is in the correct format and that the username is in lowercase.
- Use a more modern XMPP library like `sleekxmpp` for better support and fewer issues.
- Check your DNS settings and ensure you have an active internet connection.
- Suppress deprecation warnings if you continue to use `xmpppy`.
