### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 9.1.0
  * **Operating System:**
    * macOS 10.14
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * Maybe Electron <= v7, although maybe I wasn't using localStorage at all back then ðŸ¤”
### Expected Behavior
LocalStorage shouldn't be absurdly slow.
### Actual Behavior
LocalStorage is absurdly slow, requiring about 5 seconds on my machine for
this call:
    localStorage.getItem('');
### To Reproduce
This is a weird one, I spent a couple of hours tracking down this one, you
might be able to reproduce it with the files provided but I'm not sure.
  1. Running `npx electron app_dummy_slow.asar` requires about 5 seconds on my machine for a window to show up.
  2. No need really to unpack the asar, it's essentially the quick-start project with only 2 interesting lines, without either of which I can't reproduce the issue: 
    1. `localStorage.getItem('');`
      * Putting this call somewhere in `index.html` takes about 5 seconds to complete, which sounds absurd to me. Without this call I can't experience any issues.
      * The same thing happens when using `sessionStorage`.
    2. `"name": "notable",`
      * This is in the `package.json` file, using a different name I can't reproduce the issue. As "notable" is the name of my Electron app I guess when setting this name its specific local storage and session storage files are getting loaded, which for whatever reason takes forever.
  3. The "Local Storage" and "Session Storage" folders, attached below, found under "~/Library/Application Support/Notable", weigh like less than 50kb each, making this even weirder.
  4. Somewhat surprisingly Notable's appData folder weighs about 20MB on my machine, while the analogous folders for other electron apps on my machine weigh about 500kb each, but its content seems ok to me:
