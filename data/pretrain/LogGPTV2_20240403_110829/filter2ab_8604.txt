**ATT&CK ID:** S1043  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Archive Collected Data (ccf32)

The technique ccf32 has been observed using the following command to archive collected files:

```plaintext
xcopy \\c$\users\public\path.7z c:\users\public\bin\.7z /H /Y
```

This command copies and archives the file `path.7z` from the source directory `\\c$\users\public\` to the destination directory `c:\users\public\bin\`, overwriting the destination file if it already exists.
