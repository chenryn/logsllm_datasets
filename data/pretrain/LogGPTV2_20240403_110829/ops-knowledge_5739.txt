User: write a kql query for LemonDuck competition killer script execution
Assistant: This query looks for instances of the LemonDuck component KR.Bin, which is intended to kill competition prior to making the installation and persistence of the malware concrete. The killer script used is based off historical versions from 2018 and earlier, which has grown over time to include scheduled task and service names of various botnets, malware, and other competing services. The version currently in use by LemonDuck has approximately 40-60 scheduled task names. The upper maximum in this query can be modified and adjusted to include time bounding.
