To ensure that `DeprecationWarning` messages within this package are always displayed, you can add the following code to the `__init__.py` file:

```python
import warnings
import re

warnings.filterwarnings('always', category=DeprecationWarning, module=r'^{0}\.'.format(re.escape(__name__)))
```

However, it is generally not recommended to globally set warning filters in this manner, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to manage warnings in other parts of the codebase. If you feel it is necessary to do so, it is better to use the `append=True` option to add the filter without overwriting existing ones:

```python
warnings.filterwarnings('always', category=DeprecationWarning, module=r'^{0}\.'.format(re.escape(__name__)), append=True)
```

This approach ensures that your custom warning filter is added to the list of existing filters, rather than replacing them.
