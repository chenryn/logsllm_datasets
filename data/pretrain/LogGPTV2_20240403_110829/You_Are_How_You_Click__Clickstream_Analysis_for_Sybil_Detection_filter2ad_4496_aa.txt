Abstract
Fake identities and Sybil accounts are pervasive in to-
day’s online communities. They are responsible for a
growing number of threats, including fake product re-
views, malware and spam on social networks, and as-
troturf political campaigns. Unfortunately, studies show
that existing tools such as CAPTCHAs and graph-based
Sybil detectors have not proven to be effective defenses.
In this paper, we describe our work on building a prac-
tical system for detecting fake identities using server-side
clickstream models. We develop a detection approach
that groups “similar” user clickstreams into behavioral
clusters, by partitioning a similarity graph that cap-
tures distances between clickstream sequences. We vali-
date our clickstream models using ground-truth traces of
16,000 real and Sybil users from Renren, a large Chinese
social network with 220M users. We propose a practical
detection system based on these models, and show that it
provides very high detection accuracy on our clickstream
traces. Finally, we worked with collaborators at Renren
and LinkedIn to test our prototype on their server-side
data. Following positive results, both companies have
expressed strong interest in further experimentation and
possible internal deployment.
1 Introduction
It is easier than ever to create fake identities and user ac-
counts in today’s online communities. Despite increas-
ing efforts from providers, existing services cannot pre-
vent malicious entities from creating large numbers of
fake accounts or Sybils [9]. Current defense mecha-
nisms are largely ineffective. Online Turing tests such as
CAPTCHAs are routinely solved by dedicated workers
for pennies per request [22], and even complex human-
based tasks can be overcome by a growing community
of malicious crowdsourcing services [23, 39]. The result
of this trend is a dramatic rise in forged and malicious
online content such as fake reviews on Yelp [35], mal-
ware and spam on social networks [10, 11, 32], and large,
Sybil-based political lobbying efforts [27].
Recent work has explored a number of potential so-
lutions to this problem. Most proposals focus on de-
tecting Sybils in social networks by leveraging the as-
sumption that Sybils will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to befriend real
users. This forces Sybils to connect to each other and
form strongly connected subgraphs [36] that can be de-
tected using graph theoretic approaches [8, 34, 45, 46].
However, the efﬁcacy of these approaches in practice is
unclear. While some Sybil communities have been lo-
cated in the Spanish Tuenti network [7], another study on
the Chinese Renren network shows the large majority of
Sybils actively and successfully integrating themselves
into real user communities [43].
In this paper, we describe a new approach to Sybil
detection rooted in the fundamental behavioral patterns
that separate real and Sybil users. Speciﬁcally, we pro-
pose the use of clickstream models as a tool to detect
fake identities in online services such as social networks.
Clickstreams are traces of click-throughevents generated
by online users during each web browsing “session,” and
have been used in the past to model web trafﬁc and user
browsing patterns [12, 20, 24, 28]. Intuitively, Sybils and
real users have very different goals in their usage of on-
line services: where real users likely partake of numerous
features in the system, Sybils focus on speciﬁc actions
(i.e. acquiring friends and disseminating spam) while try-
ing to maximize utility per time spent. We hypothesize
that these differences will manifest as signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent (and distinctive) patterns in clickstreams, making
them effective tools for “proﬁling” user behavior. In our
context, we use these proﬁles to distinguish between real
and Sybil users.
Our work focuses on building a practical model for ac-
curate detection of Sybils in social networks. We develop
several models that encode distinct event sequences and
inter-event gaps in clickstreams. We build weighted

graphs of these sequences that capture pairwise “similar-
ity distance” between clickstreams, and apply clustering
to identify groups of user behavior patterns. We validate
our models using ground-truth clickstream traces from
16,000 real and Sybil users from Renren, a large Chinese
social network with 220M users. Using our methodol-
ogy, we build a detection system that requires little or
no knowledge of ground-truth. Finally, we validate the
usability of our system by running initial prototypes on
internal datasets at Renren and LinkedIn.
The key contributions of this paper are as follows:
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to ana-
lyze click patterns of Sybils and real users on social
networks. By analyzing detailed clickstream logs
from a large social network provider, we gain new in-
sights on activity patterns of Sybils and normal users.
• We propose and evaluate several clickstream mod-
els to characterize user clicks patterns. Specially,
we map clickstreams to a similarity graph, where
clickstreams (vertices) are connected using weighted
edges that capture pairwise similarity. We apply
graph partitioning to identify clusters that repre-
sent speciﬁc click patterns. Experiments show that
our model can efﬁciently distinguish between click-
streams of Sybil and normal users.
• We develop a practical Sybil detection system based
on our clickstream model, requiring minimal in-
put from the service provider. Experiments using
ground-truth data show that our system generates
<1% false positives and <4% false negatives.
• Working closely with industrial collaborators, we
have deployed prototypes of our system at Renren
and LinkedIn. Security teams at both companies
have run our system on real user data and received
very positive results. While corporate privacy poli-
cies limit the feedback visible to us, both companies
have expressed strong interest in further experimen-
tation and possible deployment of our system.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to study
clickstream models as a way to detect fake accounts in
online social networks. Moving forward, we believe
clickstream models are a valuable tool that can com-
plement existing techniques, by not only detecting well-
disguised Sybil accounts, but also reducing the activity
level of any remaining Sybils to that of normal users.
Roadmap.
We begin in Section 2 by describing the
problem context and our ground-truth dataset, followed
by preliminaryanalysis results in Section 3. Next, in Sec-
tion 4 we propose our clickstream models to effectively
distinguish Sybil with normal users. Then in Section 5,
we develop an incremental Sybil detector that can scale
with today’s large social networks. We then extend this
detector in Section 6 by proposing an unsupervised Sybil

ground-truthis needed. Finally, in Section 7, we describe
experimental experience of testing our prototype code in
real-world social networks (Renren and LinkedIn). We
then discuss related work in Section 8 and conclude in
Section 9.
2 Background
In this section, we provide background for our study.
First, we brieﬂy introduce the Renren social network
and the malicious Sybils that attack it. Second, we de-
scribe the key concepts of user clickstreams, as well as
the ground-truth dataset we use in our study.
Renren.
Renren is the oldest and largest Online So-
cial Network (OSN) in China, with more than 220 mil-
lion users [17]. Renren offers similar features and func-
tionalities as Facebook: users maintain personal proﬁles
and establish social connections with their friends. Ren-
ren users can update their status, write blogs, upload pho-
tos and video, and share URLs to content on and off Ren-
ren. When a user logs-in to Renren, the ﬁrst page they
see is a “news-feed” of their friends’ recent activities.
Sybils.
Like other popular OSNs, Renren is targeted
by malicious parties looking to distribute spam and steal
personal information. As in prior work, we refer to the
fake accounts involved in these attacks as Sybils [43].
Our goal is to detect and deter these malicious Sybils; our
goal is not to identify benign fakes, e.g. pseudonymous
accounts used by people to preserve their privacy.
Prior studies show that attackers try to friend normal
users using Sybil accounts [43]. On Renren, Sybils usu-
ally have complete, realistic proﬁles and use attractive
proﬁle pictures to entice normal users.
It is challeng-
ing to identify these Sybils using existing techniques be-
cause their proﬁles are well maintained, and they inte-
grate seamlessly into the social graph structure.
Clickstream Data.
In this paper, we investigate the
feasibility of using clickstreams to detect Sybils. A click-
stream is the sequence of HTTP requests made by a user
to a website. Most requests correspond to a user explic-
itly fetching a page by clicking a link, although some
requests may be programmatically generated (e.g. Xml-
HttpRequest). In our work, we assume that a clickstream
can be unambiguously attributed to a speciﬁc user ac-
count, e.g. by examining the HTTP request cookies.
Our study is based on detailed clickstreams for 9994

Sybils and 5998 normal users on Renren. Sybil click-
streams were selected at random from the population of
malicious accounts that were banned by Renren in March
and April 2011. Accounts could be banned for abu-
sive behaviors such as spamming, harvesting user data
or sending massive numbers of friend requests. Nor-
mal user clickstreams were selected uniformly at random
from Renren user population in April 2011, and were
manually veriﬁed by Renren’s security team.
In total,
The dataset summary is shown in Table 1.
our dataset includes 1,008,031 and 5,856,941 clicks for
Sybils and normal users, respectively. Each click is char-
acterized by a timestamp, an anonymized userID, and an
activity. The activity is derived from the request URL,
and describes the action the user is undertaking. For ex-
ample, the “friend request” activity corresponds to a user
sending a friend request to another user. We discuss the
different categories of activities in detail in Section 3.2.
Each user’s clickstream can be divided into sessions,
where a session represents the sequence of a user’s clicks
during a single visit to Renren. Unfortunately, users do
not always explicitly end their session by logging out of
Renren. As in prior work, we assume that a user’s ses-
sion is over if they do not make any requests for 20 min-
utes [6]. Session duration is calculated as the time in-
terval between the ﬁrst and last click within a session.
Overall, our traces contain 113,595 sessions for Sybils
and 467,179 sessions for normal users.
