**Abstract:**
Fake identities and Sybil accounts are pervasive in today's online communities, contributing to a growing number of threats such as fake product reviews, malware, spam, and astroturf political campaigns. Unfortunately, existing tools like CAPTCHAs and graph-based Sybil detectors have proven ineffective. In this paper, we present a practical system for detecting fake identities using server-side clickstream models. Our approach groups similar user clickstreams into behavioral clusters by partitioning a similarity graph that captures distances between clickstream sequences. We validate our models using ground-truth traces from 16,000 real and Sybil users on Renren, a large Chinese social network with 220 million users. We propose a detection system based on these models and demonstrate its high accuracy. Additionally, we collaborated with Renren and LinkedIn to test our prototype, which yielded positive results and strong interest in further experimentation and potential deployment.

## 1. Introduction
Creating fake identities and user accounts in online communities has become increasingly easy. Despite efforts from service providers, existing defenses cannot prevent the creation of large numbers of fake accounts or Sybils. Current mechanisms, such as CAPTCHAs, are often bypassed by dedicated workers and malicious crowdsourcing services, leading to a rise in forged and malicious content, including fake reviews, malware, spam, and large-scale Sybil-based political lobbying.

Recent research has explored various solutions, focusing on the assumption that Sybils will find it difficult to befriend real users, thus forming strongly connected subgraphs detectable through graph-theoretic approaches. However, the effectiveness of these methods in practice is uncertain. For example, while some Sybil communities have been identified in the Spanish Tuenti network, a study on the Chinese Renren network shows that most Sybils successfully integrate into real user communities.

In this paper, we introduce a new approach to Sybil detection based on fundamental behavioral patterns. Specifically, we use clickstream models to detect fake identities in online services. Clickstreams, which are traces of user interactions during web browsing sessions, have been used to model web traffic and user behavior. We hypothesize that the different goals of real and Sybil users—real users engage in various features, while Sybils focus on specific actions like acquiring friends and spreading spam—will result in distinct clickstream patterns, making them effective for profiling user behavior.

Our work focuses on building a practical model for accurate Sybil detection in social networks. We develop several models that encode event sequences and inter-event gaps in clickstreams, and we build weighted graphs to capture pairwise similarities. We apply clustering to identify groups of user behavior patterns. We validate our models using ground-truth clickstream traces from 16,000 real and Sybil users on Renren. Our detection system requires minimal knowledge of ground-truth and has been tested on internal datasets at Renren and LinkedIn, yielding very positive results.

**Key Contributions:**
- We are the first to analyze click patterns of Sybils and real users on social networks, gaining insights into their activity patterns.
- We propose and evaluate several clickstream models to characterize user click patterns, mapping clickstreams to a similarity graph and applying graph partitioning to identify clusters.
- We develop a practical Sybil detection system that generates <1% false positives and <4% false negatives.
- We have deployed prototypes of our system at Renren and LinkedIn, receiving strong interest in further experimentation and possible deployment.

We believe clickstream models can complement existing techniques by not only detecting well-disguised Sybil accounts but also reducing the activity level of remaining Sybils to that of normal users.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Renren Social Network
Renren is the largest Online Social Network (OSN) in China, with over 220 million users. It offers features similar to Facebook, including personal profiles, social connections, status updates, blogs, photo and video uploads, and content sharing. When a user logs in, they see a news feed of their friends' recent activities.

### 2.2 Sybils
Renren, like other popular OSNs, is targeted by malicious parties aiming to distribute spam and steal personal information. These fake accounts, referred to as Sybils, often have complete, realistic profiles and use attractive profile pictures to entice normal users. Identifying Sybils is challenging because their profiles are well-maintained and they integrate seamlessly into the social graph structure.

### 2.3 Clickstream Data
A clickstream is the sequence of HTTP requests made by a user to a website. Most requests correspond to explicit user actions, though some may be programmatically generated. In our study, we assume that a clickstream can be unambiguously attributed to a specific user account, typically via HTTP request cookies.

Our dataset includes detailed clickstreams for 9,994 Sybils and 5,998 normal users on Renren. Sybil clickstreams were selected from the population of malicious accounts banned in March and April 2011 for abusive behaviors such as spamming, data harvesting, and sending massive friend requests. Normal user clickstreams were randomly selected and verified by Renren’s security team. The dataset summary is shown in Table 1.

| **Dataset** | **Sybil** | **Normal** |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Date (2011)** | Feb. 28 - Apr. 30 | Mar. 31 - Apr. 30 |
| **Clicks** | 1,008,031 | 5,856,941 |
| **Users** | 9,994 | 5,998 |
| **Sessions** | 113,595 | 467,179 |

Each click is characterized by a timestamp, an anonymized userID, and an activity derived from the request URL. A session represents the sequence of a user’s clicks during a single visit to Renren, and we assume a session ends if there are no requests for 20 minutes. Our traces contain 113,595 sessions for Sybils and 467,179 sessions for normal users.

## 3. Preliminary Analysis
### 3.1 Activity Patterns
Preliminary analysis of the clickstream data reveals distinct patterns between Sybils and normal users. Figures 1-4 illustrate these differences:

- **Figure 1:** Number of sessions per user.
- **Figure 2:** Sessions throughout the day.
- **Figure 3:** Sessions per day per user.
- **Figure 4:** Average session length per user.

These figures show that Sybils tend to have more frequent and shorter sessions compared to normal users, indicating different usage patterns.

## 4. Clickstream Models
We propose several clickstream models to effectively distinguish Sybils from normal users. These models encode distinct event sequences and inter-event gaps in clickstreams. We build weighted graphs to capture pairwise similarities and apply clustering to identify groups of user behavior patterns.

## 5. Incremental Sybil Detector
We develop an incremental Sybil detector that can scale with large social networks. This detector uses our clickstream models to continuously monitor and update user behavior patterns, ensuring that it remains effective as the network grows.

## 6. Unsupervised Sybil Detector
To further enhance our system, we propose an unsupervised Sybil detector that requires only a minimal amount of ground-truth data. This detector uses clustering and similarity metrics to identify and flag suspicious user behavior without extensive prior knowledge.

## 7. Experimental Results
We tested our prototype code in real-world social networks, specifically Renren and LinkedIn. Security teams at both companies ran our system on real user data and received very positive results. While corporate privacy policies limit the feedback visible to us, both companies have expressed strong interest in further experimentation and potential deployment.

## 8. Related Work
We discuss related work on Sybil detection, including graph-based approaches and other behavioral analysis methods. Our work builds on these foundations by introducing a novel and practical approach using clickstream analysis.

## 9. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed a practical and effective system for detecting Sybil accounts in social networks using clickstream analysis. Our models and detection system have shown high accuracy and have been positively received by industry partners. We believe that clickstream models can complement existing techniques and significantly improve the detection and deterrence of malicious Sybils.

**Future Work:**
- Further refinement of clickstream models to handle more complex and evolving Sybil behaviors.
- Integration of additional data sources and machine learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy.
- Deployment and evaluation in a broader range of social networks and online platforms.
