User:  How does Linux mount a new disk?
Assistant: 1. View the name of the new disk: lsblk 2. Start partitioning: Create a new partition fdisk /dev/sda Enter n to create a new partition, enter p to create a partition, and the rest will be defaulted, then enter w to save and enter lsblk again to view, the picture below is the newly created Partition, after the partition is built, format the partition 3. Format the partition mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 -- use mkfs.ext4 here 4. Mount mkdir /test && mount /dev/sda1 /test 5. Automatically mount when booting vi /etc/fstab /dev/sda1 /test ext4 defaults 0 0 -- add this and save
