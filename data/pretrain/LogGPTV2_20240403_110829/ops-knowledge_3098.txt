**Issue: Unable to Start a New Django Project on macOS**

After installing Django using `pip`, I attempted to initiate a new project with the command:
```bash
django-admin startproject mysite
```
However, I encountered the following error:
```bash
-bash: django-admin: command not found
```
Despite searching for solutions online, I was unable to find a working fix.

**Solution: How to Start a New Django Project Using `django-admin`**

I resolved the issue by following these steps:

1. **Locate the Django Installation Path:**
   Open a Python shell and execute the following commands to determine the installation location of Django:
   ```python
   import django
   print(django.__file__)
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use:
   ```python
   python -m django --version
   ```

2. **Create a Symbolic Link:**
   Once you have the path to the `django-admin.py` file, create a symbolic link to it in `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /path/to/your/django-admin.py /usr/local/bin/django-admin.py
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/django-admin.py` with the actual path obtained from the previous step.

3. **Start a New Django Project:**
   On macOS, use the following command to start a new Django project:
   ```bash
   django-admin.py startproject mysite
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully create a new Django project on macOS.
