User: I started Django in Mac OS and after installing Django using pip, I tried to initiated a new project using the command django-admin startproject mysite. I get the error -bash: django-admin: command not found. I make quick search in Google and haven't get any solution that works. 
How to start a new project using Django using django-admin ?
Assistant: I solved the issue after reading a webpage about the mentioned issue. 

In the Python shell, write the following, 
>> import django
>> django.__file__
>> django  also works

It will provide the installation location of django.  

Change the path to the new path /usr/local/bin/django-admin.py,     
sudo ln -s  the complete path of django-admin.py      /usr/local/bin/django-admin.py

In Mac OS, The call needs to be django-admin.py startproject mysite than django-admin startproject mysite
