## Abstract
Monitoring and maintaining satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) for video streaming services is becoming increasingly challenging for mobile network operators. The growing trend of downloading and watching video content on mobile devices is driving a demand for higher bandwidth and better provisioning throughout the network infrastructure. Simultaneously, the widespread adoption of end-to-end encryption by online streaming services has limited the available indicators for identifying QoE issues.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology for detecting video streaming QoE issues from encrypted traffic. We develop predictive models to detect different levels of QoE degradation caused by three key factors: stalling, average video quality, and quality variations. These models are evaluated on the production network of a large-scale mobile operator, demonstrating that despite encryption, our methodology can accurately detect QoE problems with 72%-92% accuracy. Even higher performance is achieved when dealing with unencrypted traffic.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile video consumption is expected to increase 11-fold by 2020, accounting for 75% of total mobile data traffic [1]. This rapid growth places significant pressure on mobile operators to optimize their networks. To perform such optimizations and capacity planning, operators must deeply understand and monitor the offered Quality of Experience (QoE) for video delivery. Currently, most operators use techniques like caching, transcoding, compression, and radio resource allocation to facilitate the delivery of media-rich content.

However, the increasing trend of encrypting internet traffic, with over 60% of mobile traffic now encrypted [2], poses a significant challenge. Major video providers such as YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu have started encrypting a large portion of their video content, and this trend is expected to continue [3]. While encryption ensures user privacy, it significantly hampers the ability of operators to monitor or optimize their networks [4].

In this paper, we present a framework capable of extracting key QoE metrics, including stall detection, average representation (resolution), and representation fluctuations, from encrypted traffic. Our contributions include:

- Analyzing more than 390,000 unique non-encrypted video sessions collected by a web proxy deployed on a cellular network of a large provider with over 10 million customers to extract insights about video delivery mechanisms and QoE issues.
- Using these insights and ground truth from non-encrypted traffic to build a unified QoE measurement method for both adaptive and traditional video streaming over HTTP.
- Validating our work on encrypted traffic collected from the same network. We compare similarities and differences to non-encrypted traffic and set up controlled experiments to verify the accuracy of the developed model. Our models can identify quality issues from unencrypted data with accuracies between 78% and 93.5%, and from encrypted traffic with accuracies between 76% and 91.8%.
- Providing important insights about the information that can be extracted from encrypted traffic. Our results indicate that passive measurements from a single vantage point are sufficient to accurately detect key factors affecting user experience, and client instrumentation is not required.

## 2. Background and Motivation

### 2.1 Video Streaming Background
HTTP has become the preferred protocol for video delivery in recent years due to its advantages, including firewall pass-through, easy network address translation, and the benefits of TCP, such as congestion control and reliable packet delivery.

#### Traditional HTTP Video Streaming
In traditional HTTP video streaming, the video is downloaded as a single continuous file with a fixed quality setting. Video buffering is used to compensate for jitter and short-term bandwidth variations. Each video session typically includes two buffering phases: the start-up phase and the steady state. During the start-up phase, the player downloads the first part of the video as quickly as possible to minimize initial delay. In the steady state, the download pauses and resumes based on buffer levels, known as pacing.

#### HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS)
HAS splits videos into multiple segments, each encoded in different quality profiles. The player fetches consecutive segments, and the quality profile of the next segment is determined based on the throughput of the previous segment and the available playback time in the buffer. This dynamic adjustment minimizes stalls and adapts to network changes.

### 2.2 Factors Affecting Video QoE
- **Initial Delay**: The time from the user's request until playback begins, including network delay and initial buffering delay. Studies show that users are more tolerant of initial delays compared to other impairments like stalls or quality changes [6, 7].
- **Stalls**: Occur when the network throughput is insufficient, causing the buffer to deplete and playback to pause. Both the frequency and duration of stalls correlate with poor QoE [8, 9]. We measure stalls using the Rebuffering Ratio, which is the time spent stalling over the total duration of the video session.
- **Average Representation Quality**: Applicable only to HAS, this is the average of all individual segment qualities. Higher quality representations are linked to better overall QoE [10].
- **Representation Quality Variation**: The frequency and amplitude of quality changes. Frequent and large changes negatively impact QoE [11].

### 2.3 Problem Statement
Adaptive streaming and encryption are now the default technologies for most popular content providers. This has introduced new challenges for identifying video QoE issues, rendering previous solutions obsolete. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) methods for extracting quality metrics no longer work with encrypted traffic, and adaptive quality switching introduces new factors affecting user experience. There is a high demand for updated tools and methods to detect and quantify quality issues from encrypted traffic.

### 2.4 Challenges
- **Compatibility**: Providing a solution compatible with both current and previous video streaming technologies.
- **Limited Information**: Identifying the right metrics from the limited information provided by encrypted traffic and building models to detect quality impairments.
- **Privacy and Generalizability**: Developing a methodology that can detect problems from network traffic alone without relying on device or player instrumentation, ensuring privacy and ease of deployment.

## 3. Dataset
The dataset used in this study is constructed from unencrypted data containing the ground truth for QoE impairments of each video session. This information is used to create predictive models, which are then validated using a set of encrypted data through controlled experiments.

### 3.1 Weblogs
The data is collected from a web proxy deployed on the cellular network of a large European provider. The proxy logs all unencrypted HTTP traffic, including IP-port tuples, URIs, object sizes, transaction times, request timestamps, and transport layer performance metrics (e.g., BDP, BIF, packet loss, retransmissions, and RTT).

The dataset is created from YouTube traffic weblogs collected over 45 days from February to April 2016. We focus on weblogs corresponding to video and audio segment downloads and signaling exchanged during playback. All data is anonymized by removing private information, preserving only the unique 16-character video session ID generated by YouTube.

YouTube is chosen for this study due to its popularity, diverse content, and adoption of modern technologies like DASH and HTML-based video playback. Although Google has deployed HTTPS for YouTube, a significant amount of video sessions in our dataset are still in cleartext HTTP, attributed to legacy devices and players that do not support TLS encryption.
