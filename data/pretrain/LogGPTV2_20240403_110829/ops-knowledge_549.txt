User: Use Python to write a program to filter out all files whose file names match a specific format from a directory and back them up.
Assistant: The following is a Python program that can filter out all files whose filenames match a specific format from a directory and back them up: ``` python import os import shutil src_dir = input("Please enter the target directory path:") # Enter the target directory path file_ext = input("Please enter the file extension:") # Input the file extension for filename in os.listdir(src_dir): if filename.endswith(file_ext): src_path = os.path.join(src_dir , filename) # Join file path backup_folder = os.path.join(src_dir, "backup") # Backup folder path if not os.path.exists(backup_folder): # If the backup folder does not exist, create it os. mkdir(backup_folder) backup_path = os.path.join(backup_folder, filename) # splice the backup file path shutil.copy(src_path, backup_path) # copy the file to the backup folder``` The above program first requires the user to enter the target directory path and the file extension to be backed up, then use the `os.listdir()` function to traverse all the files in the target directory, filter out the files ending with the entered file extension, and use `os.path.join()` The function concatenates the file path and the backup file path. Then, the program creates a backup folder and uses the `shutil.copy()` function to copy files into the backup folder. For example, suppose the user enters the target directory path as "/home/user/documents", and the extension of the file to be backed up is ".txt", the program will find all files ending with ".txt" in this directory, and They are copied to the "/home/user/documents/backup" folder.
