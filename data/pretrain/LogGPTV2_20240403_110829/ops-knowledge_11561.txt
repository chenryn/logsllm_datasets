User: I downloaded Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 and it installed in
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0\vcvarsall.bat
However, I am getting the error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat error when attempting to install "MySQL-python".
I added C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Common\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0; to my Path.
I am using python 2.7.8
Assistant: Use the command prompt shortcut provided from installing the MSI.
This will launch the prompt with VCVarsall.bat activated for the targeted environment.
Depending on your installation, you can find this in the Start Menu under All Program -> Microsoft Visual C++ For Python -> then pick the command prompt based on x64 or x86.
Otherwise, press Windows Key and search for "Microsoft Visual C++ For Python".
