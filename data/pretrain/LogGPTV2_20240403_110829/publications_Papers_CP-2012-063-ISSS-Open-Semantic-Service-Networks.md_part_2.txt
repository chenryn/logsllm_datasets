approaches, such as e3value and e3service, our aim is not to develop a communication tool for
the manual analysis of well-known and established networks. Instead, we seek the global and
automatic re(construction) of possibly unknown service networks to enable the large scale pro-

5.1 Servicemodeling
Duetothepresenceofmainlyunstructuredinformationaboutbusinessservicespubliclyavailable
atcorporates’Websites,inbusinessreportsoracademicstudies(e.g. [KZC+04]),itisextremely
difficult to identify anything substantial and significant about service models and relationships.
The information available is unstructured (see for example [Fre08]), does not comply to any
common semantics, and is often not easily accessible. Therefore, our work targets to address
theselimitationsandprovidebuildingblocksusingserviceandrelationshipmodelingforremote
accessandretrieval.
In the field of service modeling, we have been working on descriptions for business services.
OurpreviousworkhasproducedUSDL[CBMK10,BO12],theUnifiedServiceDescriptionLan-
guage. In the past, only the quality of physical goods and products was primarily driven by
adherence to manufacturing specifications. With the introduction of USDL there is a paradigm

The initial version of USDL was ready in 2009. It was later renamed to α-USDL (pronounced
alpha-USDL).Basedontheexperiencesgainedfromα-USDL,aW3CIncubatorgroupwascre-
atedandUSDLwasadaptedandextendedbasedonindustryfeedback. Thissecondversionwas
finalized at the end of 2011. In order to make the specification gain a wider global acceptance,
a version called Linked-USDL emerged using semantic Web principles and its development is
stillinprogress. ThetermLinked-USDLshouldnotbeconfusedwiththeideathatthelanguage

WhiletheLinked-USDLhasbeeninitiallyconstructedtodescribebusinessservices,ouranalysis
revealed in a preliminary study that it can be used to model services and service networks by
adding rich, multi-level relationships. Linked-USDL is suitable to support the concept of open
servicesystemsandmakesserviceinformationaccessibletoremoteandheterogeneoussoftware
applications which can retrieve and align service models into service networks for various ex-
ploratoryuses.
At present, work done in the domain of service modeling, such as *-USDL service description
languages, has tackled services as single atomic entities and groups of services (i.e. service
bundles). Without additional research, these languages will lead to the construction of service

5.2 Expressingrichservicerelationships
Ourapproachwillconnectservicemodelshostedinmarketplaces,corporateWebsites,andpro-
curement systems using a computer-understandable format. The existence of tangible relation-
ships between companies has been observed in a range of studies over the past 25 years, but
the phenomena of service systems was discovered only recently [HF02]. Nonetheless, its pro-
found importance for society has already attracted a remarkable attention from academia and
industry. What is needed is to be able to represent and identify richer service relationships be-
tween services, so that the richness of the real world is not crammed inaccurately and inappro-
priately into very limited and inexpressive types of relationships. For example, in the field of
Semantic Web, simple relations provided by RDFS and OWL – such as rdfs:subClassOf,
owl:EquivalentClass, rdf:seeAlso and owl:sameAs – are strict and limited rela-
tionshipswhicharenotsuitabletoconnectalltheworld’sservices.
In order to develop a model for rich service relationships, research from the areas of business
management and supply chain networks is required. For example, Weill and Vitale [WV01]
haveintroducedasetofsimpleschematicsintendedtoprovidetoolsfortheanalysisanddesign
of business initiatives based on participants (firms of interest, customers, suppliers, and allies),
relationships,andflows(e.g. ofmoney,information,products,orservices),whichmayprovidea
baselinefortheworkwhichneedstobedoneonservicenetworks. Inthesamelines,Bovetand
Martha[BM00]havealsoprovidedresearchresultswhichneedtobeconsideredinourapproach.
They propose the concept of value net to define a network of partnerships which is a dynamic,
high-performancenetworkofcustomers/supplierpartnershipsandinformationflows.Thee3value
and e3service approaches have already identified a few relationships such as value exchange,
core/enhancingandoptionalbundling(see[ABG+04]).
Nonetheless,relationshipsshouldbemoreexpressivethansimplyestablishingtheaddedvalueof

We propose to develop a core open semantic service relationships model called OSSR which
