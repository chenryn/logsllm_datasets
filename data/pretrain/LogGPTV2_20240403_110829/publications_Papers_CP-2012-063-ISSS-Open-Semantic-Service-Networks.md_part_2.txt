### 1. Introduction to Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSN)

Open semantic service networks (OSSNs) are complex, domain-dependent structures that aggregate, configure, and manage people, resources, and information to create new value for consumers. These networks are no longer confined to a few organizations; they are open and large-scale, often involving thousands of services worldwide. Unlike traditional process models (e.g., BPEL), OSSNs do not focus on control-flow elements and temporal dependencies but rather on the relationships between services as economic activities. Understanding how these services evolve and the types of relationships they establish can significantly advance our knowledge of digital service-based economies.

### 2. Business Research and Service Networks

The business research field has primarily provided conceptual models for business networks, often described in natural language. These models, such as those by Weiner and Weisbecker [WW11] and Osterwalder et al. [OPC10], are not machine-readable or semantically described, making them unsuitable for large-scale service network analysis. Traditional business modeling approaches, including e3value [ABG+04], tend to focus inward on the company rather than the broader network. In contrast, our goal is to develop a global, automatic re(construction) of potentially unknown service networks, enabling large-scale processing of service information.

Collaborative networks, as studied by [ACM05], have explored how partners can dynamically form networks to support virtual organizations. Key challenges include selecting potential partners in an open universe and acquiring profile information about organizations. Our work aims to address these requirements using semantics, open models, and distributed data. Additionally, we can benefit from the progress made in collaborative networks regarding relationship development, governing rules, and principles for network participation.

### 3. Seven Design Principles of OSSN

Open semantic service networks (OSSNs) are designed to sustain and power the digital representation, modeling, and reasoning about business service networks. The following seven design principles underpin the construction of OSSNs:

- **Service vs. Web Service**: A real-world service aggregates, structures, and configures people, resources, and information to create new value for consumers. A web service, on the other hand, is a computational entity and software artifact that can be invoked remotely to achieve a user goal. OSSNs encompass the former.
- **Social Process**: The (re)construction of OSSNs is a peer-to-peer social process where firms, groups, and individuals (i.e., the community) freely cooperate to provide information on services and their relationships, ultimately creating a unique, global, large-scale service network.
- **Self-Governance**: OSSNs are a common good created by the community through widely distributed decision-making and autonomy. The network is governed by its participants, not by an external central authority or hierarchical management structure.
- **Openness and Free Access**: The OSSNs created are freely accessible on a universal basis, while recognizing individual authorship and contributions.
- **Autonomy and Distribution**: Participants have the autonomy to advertise their know-how, capabilities, and skills in the form of services and establish relationships with other services. Services are distributed over space and time, forming new services as networks.
- **Semantic Networks**: OSSNs are semantic, explicitly describing services and relationships using conceptual or domain models, shared vocabularies, and ideally, Semantic Web standards and techniques.
- **Decoupling**: Decoupling means that OSSNs are made of service descriptions and relationships, but relationships are defined independently of specific service description languages.

As our work advances, we expect to adjust, generalize, or specialize this initial list of design principles.

### 4. Approach to Open Semantic Service Networks

Our long-term goal is to develop rich, open service networks, which involves four main activities:

- **Service Modeling**: Creating an ontology by identifying and modeling business service concepts. Semantic Web ontologies can enrich service descriptions and make the underlying information available to both humans and remote software applications.
- **Expressing Rich Service Relationships**: Developing a model for specifying connections between services. The encoding of relationships needs to be rich, include business information, and be computer-understandable, allowing for automatic extraction and construction of service networks.
- **Populating Service and Relationship Models**: To enable widespread use, there is a need to bootstrap service networks with up-to-date services and relationship instances. Crawling, web mining, and crowdsourcing are viable options to create initial service descriptions, traces about the created service networks, and service relationship inference.
- **Service Network Construction**: Constructing globally distributed service networks requires service models to be accessed, retrieved, stored, and integrated. New research on parallel approaches and scalable storage systems is indispensable.

### 5. Service Modeling

Given the unstructured information about business services available at corporate websites, business reports, and academic studies, it is challenging to identify substantial and significant service models and relationships. The available information is unstructured, does not comply with common semantics, and is often not easily accessible. Our work aims to address these limitations and provide building blocks using service and relationship modeling for remote access and retrieval.

In the field of service modeling, we have developed the Unified Service Description Language (USDL). USDL bridges business, operational, and technical perspectives, modeling service concepts and properties such as service level, pricing, legal aspects, participants, marketing material, distribution channels, bundling, operations, interfaces, and resources. The initial version of USDL was ready in 2009 and was later renamed to Î±-USDL. Based on industry feedback, a W3C Incubator group was created, and USDL was adapted and extended. To gain wider global acceptance, a version called Linked-USDL was developed using Semantic Web principles. Linked-USDL retains necessary simplicity for computation and modeling, reuses existing vocabularies, and provides a simple yet effective means for publishing and interlinking distributed data for automatic computer processing.

While Linked-USDL was initially constructed to describe business services, our analysis revealed that it can be used to model services and service networks by adding rich, multi-level relationships. This makes service information accessible to remote and heterogeneous software applications, which can retrieve and align service models into service networks for various exploratory uses.

### 6. Expressing Rich Service Relationships

Our approach will connect service models hosted in marketplaces, corporate websites, and procurement systems using a computer-understandable format. The existence of tangible relationships between companies has been observed in numerous studies, but the phenomena of service systems were discovered only recently. What is needed is a model to represent and identify richer service relationships, so that the richness of the real world is not inaccurately crammed into limited and inexpressive types of relationships.

To develop a model for rich service relationships, we draw from research in business management and supply chain networks. For example, Weill and Vitale [WV01] introduced simple schematics for analyzing and designing business initiatives based on participants, relationships, and flows. Bovet and Martha [BM00] proposed the concept of value nets to define dynamic, high-performance networks of customer/supplier partnerships and information flows. The e3value and e3service approaches have identified relationships such as value exchange, core/enhancing, and optional bundling.

However, relationships should be more expressive than simply establishing added value when services are bundled. Organizational, strategic, process, activity, social, KPI dependencies, and cause-effect relationships also need to be considered. Spohrer and Maglio [SM10] defined the ISPAR (Initiate-Service-Propose-Agree-Realize) typology of interactions that may occur between service systems. Some interactions are directly value-creating (such as proposing, agreeing, and realizing the service), while others are not (such as disputes).

We propose to develop a core open semantic service relationships model (OSSR) that defines the main concepts and properties required to establish rich, multi-level relationships between service models encoded using Linked-USDL. Our idea behind the formalization of service networks is pragmatic, aiming to create a connected global service network using computer-understandable descriptions. OSSR aims to meet the needs of service stakeholders as service-centric platforms (e.g., marketplaces, procurement systems, corporate websites, service blogs, and forums) become more prevalent on the Internet. Finding relevant relationships among services will become increasingly important for service providers and consumers.

Open and rich relationships are very different from the temporal and control-flow relations found in business process models (e.g., BPEL, BPMN, Petri nets, EPC). Once constructed, they are open and can be freely and individually accessed and retrieved over the Web. They are rich because they relate two services using a multi-layer model, enabling the indication of roles (e.g., provider, consumer, competitor, or complementor), the strength of a relationship (e.g., high or low), dependencies, and comparisons based on the number and types of operations provided.
