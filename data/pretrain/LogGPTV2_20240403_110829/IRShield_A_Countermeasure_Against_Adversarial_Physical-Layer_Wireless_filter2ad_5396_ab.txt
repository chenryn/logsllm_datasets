Our scheme, which we refer to as IRShield, is laid out as
a standalone privacy-preserving extension for plug-and-play
integration with existing wireless infrastructure. Finally, we
present an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed
technique, showing that it successfully prevents adversarial
motion sensing. In particular, IRShield lowered detection rates
to 5 % or less in a state-of-the-art attack on Wi-Fi devices.
Our measurement data is available online in order to support
research reproducibility [1].

Considering a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system
typical for Wi-Fi in which the transmitter or receiver has NT or
NR antennas, Gl(k, t) represents the NR × NT-dimensional
signal propagation matrix of the lth propagation path. This
matrix then involves the complex channel gain and possible
steering or response vectors at a certain time t. N (k, t)
denotes measurement noise.
Building upon such channel estimates from conventional
communication systems, e. g., Wi-Fi [19], wireless sensing
seeks to extract
information on the physical propagation
environment contained in the channel response. Applications
such as human activity and gesture recognition, imaging, or
vital sign monitoring [34], [19] impressively demonstrate the
ability of commodity wireless devices to detect environmental
conditions and provide novel use-cases for the communica-
tion equipment. However, despite its many legitimate uses,
wireless sensing can also be deployed by adversaries: Passive
eavesdroppers can receive packets and gain information about
remote environments, leading to potential privacy violations
of victim parties.
When it comes to the threat of adversarial human motion
sensing, it is, ﬁrst and foremost, important to understand the
mechanisms underlying the attack. First,
the amplitude of
Gl(k, t) depends on whether a path is temporarily blocked
by a person at time t or not. Further, motion can introduce
temporary new propagation paths as the human body also
reﬂects signals. Thus, the impact of human motion on the
wireless channel is expected to vary over time, depending on
the individual’s position and the number of affected prop-
agation paths. Further, due to distance-dependent path loss
of radio wave propagation, shorter propagation paths, e. g.,
LOS or short NLOS paths, contribute most to the channel.
This is an important aspect, since a person moving into the
LOS affects (blocks) the strongest propagation paths, yielding
strong variation of the wireless channel.
B. Smart Radio Environments
The IRS is considered a promising technology for future
wireless networks [18] as it enables smart radio environ-
ments [23]. More precisely, the IRS is a synthetic surface
that has digitally reconﬁgurable reﬂection properties of radio
waves. This rather new concept is rooted in physics research
on metamaterials and metasurfaces [13], which recently saw
drastic simpliﬁcation that led to the IRS. Here, many reﬂecting
elements distributed across a surface are individually and
electronically adjustable, allowing dynamic manipulation of
impinging radio waves. For instance, the IRS may be conﬁg-
ured to reﬂect signals into a particular direction. Thus, the
IRS allows partial reconﬁguration of the radio propagation
environment to alter the wireless channel.

We consider an IRS consisting of M reﬂecting elements
with the mth conﬁgurable reﬂection coefﬁcient rm(t). The
reﬂection coefﬁcient can be selected among a discrete set
of values and is changing the reﬂected signal, such that the
incoming wave is multiplied by this factor. For each element,
additional propagation paths become part of the channel.
Incorporating the IRS contribution, we rewrite Eq. (1) as
(2)
where G(cid:48)
m(k, t) is the signal propagation via the mth IRS
element. Eq. (2) shows how the channel matrices can be
modiﬁed by engineering the values of rm(t). On the other
hand, randomizing the IRS conﬁguration implies partial ran-
domization of the channel.
III. ATTACK SCENARIO
In this section, we introduce the threat model and outline the
adversary’s strategy, as described in the state-of-the-art attack
in [37]. Further, we elaborate on the experimental evaluation.
A. Threat Model
In this work, we consider a number of legitimate Wi-Fi
devices which transmit packets. The devices, which we also
refer to as anchors, are deployed within an ordinary en-
vironment, such as a home or an ofﬁce. The goal of the
passive eavesdropper, Eve, is to infer human motion within the
environment by analyzing eavesdropped packets. We assume
that Eve possesses a wireless receiver that is able to pick
up and demodulate signals originating from the anchors. Eve
does not have access to the environment but can position her
receiver at arbitrary public locations outside the perimeter.
After initial positioning of the receiver, Eve can then proceed
to act remotely. Furthermore, we assume Eve is not able to
break the applied cryptography, i. e., to read secured payload
data. However, since the anchors employ standard-compliant
Wi-Fi communication, Eve can obtain physical-layer channel
estimations from the known packet preambles.
We assume that the owner (i.e. the defender) of the envi-
ronment can position the anchor devices at will. Furthermore,
we assume the defender can place one or multiple IRS within
their space and apply customized conﬁgurations.
B. Eavesdropper Strategy as per [37]
The basic rationale for adversarial wireless sensing is that
the wireless channel is coupled to environmental changes such
as human motion. However, the exact relation between the
observed channel and the environment is non-trivial, i. e., the
channel response cannot be directly used to make elaborate
claims on the physical state of the environment. Instead, sev-
eral preprocessing steps shall be used in order to accomplish
tasks such as motion detection. Here, we follow the attack
strategy outlined in [37]. Similar to [6], [28], the authors

describe an approach based on a sliding-window standard
deviation over a time series of CSI magnitudes. The intuition
behind this approach is rooted in the observation that a static
channel response indicates a steady environment whereas a
dynamic (time-varying) channel response indicates a varying
environment. To illustrate this, we plot a set of Wi-Fi CSI
values with and without movement in Fig. 2a.
By eavesdropping Wi-Fi packets at time t from an anchor,
Eve obtains a time series of complex-valued estimates of
the wireless channel between Eve and the anchor node. At
each time instant, Eve gathers a multitude of parallel channel
estimates due to diversity from (i) the OFDM subcarriers and
(ii) the spatial channels for MIMO transmissions. Therefore,
Eve can leverage the combined measurements
vec (H(1, t))T , . . . , vec (H(K, t))T(cid:17)T
h(t) =
(cid:16)
to obtain insights on the victim’s surroundings. In the follow-
ing, we denote the nth element of such a measurement vector
as hn(t). Due to lacking synchronization, the signal phase
of Wi-Fi channel estimates is subject to severe measurement
imperfections and thus is not reliable. Therefore, we discard
the phase and use the absolute value of hn(t) = |hn(t)|. Then,
Eve uses a windowing technique with window size w = 1 s
to calculate a moving standard deviation
σ(w)
n (t) =
Std
τ∈{t−w+1,...,t} (hn(τ )) .
(4)
To illustrate this step, Fig. 2b depicts a single Wi-Fi subcarrier
over time (top) and its corresponding sliding-window standard
deviation (bottom). It can clearly be seen that
the latter
quantiﬁes motion-induced temporal variations.
Finally, to take advantage of the available diversity do-
mains [6], we average over NRNT spatial channels and K
subcarriers, i. e.,
KNRNT(cid:88)

In the remainder of this paper, we also refer to this averaged
sliding-window standard deviation, ¯σ(w)(t), as adversarial
observation.
To decide whether ¯σ(w)(t) indicates motion, [37] uti-
lizes a threshold-based detection, i. e., motion is detected if

where mediant {·} and MADt {·} denote the median and

the implementation details outlined in [37], we adopt
the
choice of the conservativeness factor C = 11. It should be
noted that alternative threshold deﬁnitions are possible such
as, e. g., based on comparison of long-term and short-term
sliding-window variances [6].
Since our goal
is to develop a countermeasure, we
seek to strengthen the adversarial setup compared to [37]
where a smartphone-based eavesdropper with a single an-
tenna was considered. Therefore, we utilize multi-antenna
Wi-Fi routers (TP-Link N750) for our experimental setup as
both anchor nodes and eavesdroppers. These are equipped
with NR = NT = 3 antennas each and implement
IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi [25]. In our experimental setup,
the
routers run an OpenWrt operating system and provide CSI
data from the ath9k-based Wi-Fi chipset [32] upon reception
of a packet. The anchors transmit packets on a 20 MHz
wide channel at 5,320 MHz (Wi-Fi channel 64). Upon receipt
of each packet, the eavesdropper obtains a complex-valued
CSI vector, containing the channel estimations for each of
the 9 spatial channels and 56 non-zero OFDM subcarriers.
As in [37], out of the 56 subcarriers, we select K = 28
ones with the highest pair-wise correlation coefﬁcient. Fur-
thermore, while the smartphone implementation from [37]
reports 8-11 packets/sec., our implementation is capable of
approx. 70 packets/sec.
As the target environment, we consider an ordinary ofﬁce
within our institute’s building of size approx. 7.5 x 5.5 m. A
ﬂoor plan of the room (target area) is shown in Fig. 3. Here,
at a publicly accessible area on the outside of the target area,
the eavesdropper receives Wi-Fi packets from the anchors.

In a real-world scenario, Eve would initially perform a long-
term reference measurement to determine the motion-detection
threshold u using Eq. (6), assuming that the environment
conditions remain steady over a long period of time [37]. In
our experiments, we grant the eavesdropper a 3 min reference
measurement under optimal conditions, i. e., the target area is
guaranteed to be without motion and completely steady.
Subsequently, we proceed with a measurement where a
person walks along a pre-deﬁned path through the target area.
The exact course is indicated by the numbered arrows in Fig. 3.
The corresponding measurement results are shown in Fig. 4
where we plot the reference measurement and the derived
threshold as well as the eavesdropper’s observation during
human motion.
Fig. 4a and 4b show the respective adversary observations
by eavesdropping anchor 1 from positions A and B as depicted
in Fig. 3. For eavesdropper position A, we can see from the
motion-trigger region (shaded red) that motion is successfully
detected when the person is in proximity to the anchor device
(note the indication of the person’s position at the top of each
ﬁgure). For eavesdropper position B, motion is detected with
greater spatial extent, i. e., not only close to the anchor but
also within the LOS of the anchor and the adversary.
Firstly, this result conﬁrms the attack scenario and the effec-
tiveness of our implementation. Another key observation is the
location-dependent attack performance: The motion detection
works best when the person walking in the target environment
is within or close to the LOS between the anchor and the
eavesdropper. This observation is in accordance with the model
from Section II-A: The strong LOS signal component and very
direct NLOS signal components typically contribute most to
the channel response. Thus, upon disturbance of these paths,
the eavesdropper observes stronger variations in the channel
response. This also lines up with the results in Fig. 4c and 4d,
showing the observations from eavesdropping anchor 2. The
LOS between the anchor and the eavesdropper now covers a
larger area in the target environment and is crossed by the
walking person several times. As depicted by the identical
scaling of the y-axis for each ﬁgure, it can be clearly observed
that the signals from anchor 2 are more sensitive for human
motion. Thus, this time the adversary successfully detects
motion for the entire walk along the path.
