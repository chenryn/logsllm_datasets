the mean comfort-level scores for two different types of con-
tent within images: 1) background objects and 2) people
inadvertently captured in images (i.e., bystanders). Next, we
will discuss the concerns of people with VIPs in relation to
different types of objects and people in the background of
images.9
4.2.1 Concerns with objects in the background
We categorized the background objects in our survey into four
types: (1) Personally Identiﬁable Information or PII (credit
card numbers, bills, mail showing one’s address, and ofﬁcial
documents) [55], (2) objects affecting one’s impression man-
agement (mess, medical prescriptions),10 (3) general objects
(food, books), and (4) laptop screens.
Figure 1 illustrates participants’ comfort levels for various
classes of objects. As expected, we found that participants
are least comfortable sharing their PII and most comfortable
sharing general objects. People also show a higher concern
about the objects that may impact their impression manage-
ment. We conducted an overall Friedman rank-sum test and
detected that at least one statistically signiﬁcant difference ex-
ists between attributes (χ2(1)= 169.2, p0.05) between the two groups.
5 Findings: Qualitative Analysis
We now present the results of our qualitative analysis, which
shed light on the reasons behind our quantitative ﬁndings. Par-
ticipants expressed privacy and security concerns about the
unintended sharing of background information with human-
assistants. One participant summed it up, saying, “I am un-
comfortable sharing what I cannot see” (P102). A majority of
the concerns (56.4%, N=83) related to sharing sensitive and
personally identiﬁable information about the participants and
the people around them. In light of these concerns, a common
defensive strategy was to physically clear the exposed areas
and remove the sensitive contents before using the cameras:
“I would need to keep in mind who I was asking for
assistance, I would also check the area to make sure
it was clear of clutter and other objects.
[P48]”
Thus, it was clear that participants were greatly concerned
about their privacy in the context of background objects and
went as far as to clear the background in some instances.
We highlight interesting cases such as ‘impersonal trust’ and
anonymous interaction in the following sections. We ﬁrst
present ﬁndings of the reasoning for the participants to se-
lectively disclose the background contents present in images.
We then report their reasons for selectively disclosing certain
types of behavior with different audiences.
5.1 Reasons for selective content disclosure
In analyzing the qualitative reasons for privacy concerns, iden-
tity theft emerged as a dominant concern among people with
VIPs. Participants were largely uncomfortable with sharing
their PII with human-assistants. Interestingly, however, par-
ticipants (18.4%, N=27) also expressed strong concerns about

being judged negatively for sharing the messiness of their
surroundings. Participants mentioned feeling embarrassed,
and preferred to avoid sharing a messy area:
“I’m very picky about being messy, I wouldn’t want
people to get the wrong impression of me by watch-
ing other people’s mess!”
[P144]
Prior studies reported that computer screens are one of
lifeloggers’ major privacy concerns as people spend a consid-
erable amount of time in front of devices that display private
information [42, 49]. Our participants reported mixed reac-
tions about laptop screens in the background that varied based
on what might be displayed on the laptop screen. They would
be more uncomfortable if it showed any private information.
“A laptop screen is seldom an issue for me, unless
it provides information that can be used in identity
theft.”
[P114]
We sought to understand the disclosure behavior of the
participants and found that participants considered sharing
the image of bystanders without their consent to be a violation
of their privacy.
“I have no problem having parts of myself visible,
even my face, depending on the app in question. I
would want camera-based technology to be discreet
so I wouldn’t take pictures of people at other tables,
in case they would be uncomfortable.”
[P34]
While participants were comfortable sharing background
objects with family member, they preferred not to compromise
the privacy of bystanders, even with their family.
“I have a close relationship with family, I generally
don’t care what they see. However, I worry about
what would happen if certain data, such as other
people’s whereabouts, is compromised.”
