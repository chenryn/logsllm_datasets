### 4.2 Comfort Levels with Different Types of Content in Images

#### 4.2.1 Concerns with Background Objects
We categorized the background objects in our survey into four types:
1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: This includes credit card numbers, bills, mail showing one’s address, and official documents.
2. **Objects Affecting Impression Management**: These are items that might impact how others perceive the individual, such as mess or medical prescriptions.
3. **General Objects**: Common items like food and books.
4. **Laptop Screens**: The content displayed on laptop screens.

**Figure 1** illustrates participants’ comfort levels for various classes of objects. As expected, participants were least comfortable sharing their PII and most comfortable sharing general objects. They also expressed higher concern about objects that could affect their impression management. An overall Friedman rank-sum test revealed at least one statistically significant difference between the attributes (χ²(1) = 169.2, p < 0.05).

### 5. Findings: Qualitative Analysis

Our qualitative analysis provides deeper insights into the reasons behind the quantitative findings. Participants expressed privacy and security concerns about the unintended sharing of background information with human-assistants. One participant summarized this sentiment: “I am uncomfortable sharing what I cannot see” (P102). A majority of the concerns (56.4%, N=83) related to sharing sensitive and personally identifiable information about the participants and the people around them.

In response to these concerns, a common defensive strategy was to physically clear the exposed areas and remove sensitive contents before using the cameras. For example, one participant stated:
“I would need to keep in mind who I was asking for assistance, and I would also check the area to make sure it was clear of clutter and other objects.”
[P48]

This indicates that participants were highly concerned about their privacy, particularly in the context of background objects, and even went so far as to clear the background in some instances.

#### 5.1 Reasons for Selective Content Disclosure

In analyzing the qualitative reasons for privacy concerns, identity theft emerged as a dominant issue among participants. They were largely uncomfortable with sharing their PII with human-assistants. Interestingly, 18.4% (N=27) of participants also expressed strong concerns about being judged negatively for sharing the messiness of their surroundings. One participant mentioned feeling embarrassed and preferring to avoid sharing a messy area:
“I’m very picky about being messy; I wouldn’t want people to get the wrong impression of me by watching other people’s mess!”
[P144]

Previous studies have reported that computer screens are a major privacy concern for lifeloggers, as they often display private information [42, 49]. Our participants had mixed reactions to laptop screens in the background, depending on the content displayed. They were more uncomfortable if the screen showed any private information:
“A laptop screen is seldom an issue for me, unless it provides information that can be used in identity theft.”
[P114]

We also found that participants considered sharing images of bystanders without their consent to be a violation of their privacy:
“I have no problem having parts of myself visible, even my face, depending on the app in question. I would want camera-based technology to be discreet so I wouldn’t take pictures of people at other tables, in case they would be uncomfortable.”
[P34]

While participants were comfortable sharing background objects with family members, they preferred not to compromise the privacy of bystanders, even with their family:
“I have a close relationship with family, and I generally don’t care what they see. However, I worry about what would happen if certain data, such as other people’s whereabouts, is compromised.”
[P82]
