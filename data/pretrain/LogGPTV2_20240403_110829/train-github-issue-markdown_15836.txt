_Please make sure that this is a feature request. As per ourGitHub Policy, we

**System information**
  * TensorFlow version (you are using): 2.0
  * Are you willing to contribute it (Yes/No): Happy to help as much as I can!
**Describe the feature and the current behavior/state.**  
TensorFlow 1.x support specifying GPU devices to use:
    # Horovod: pin GPU to be used to process local rank (one GPU per process)
    config = tf.ConfigProto()
    config.gpu_options.visible_device_list = str(hvd.local_rank())
There's no comparable API in TensorFlow 2.0. The closest option is to use the
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. Unfortunately,
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` prevents processes from doing `cudaMemcpy` from/to
devices not owned by the process. There's a significant performance
degradation when NCCL is used with P2P communication disabled.
The ask is to add an API to TensorFlow 2.0 to enable device selection.
**Will this change the current api? How?**  
Yes, will introduce an API to select GPU devices to use.
**Who will benefit with this feature?**  
Users of Horovod.
**Any Other info.**
