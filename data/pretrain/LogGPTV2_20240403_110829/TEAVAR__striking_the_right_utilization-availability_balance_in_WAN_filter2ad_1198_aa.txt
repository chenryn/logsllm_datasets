## Abstract
To meet the continuous growth in demand, cloud providers invest millions of dollars in expanding the capacity of their wide-area backbone networks (WANs) and dedicate significant effort to efficiently utilizing this capacity. A key challenge is achieving a good balance between network utilization and availability, as these objectives are inherently at odds; a highly utilized network may not be able to handle unexpected traffic shifts due to link or node failures. We propose a novel approach inspired by financial risk theory: using empirical data to generate a probabilistic model of network failures and maximizing bandwidth allocation to users while meeting an operator-specified availability target. This approach allows network operators to strike the optimal utilization-availability balance based on their specific goals and operational realities.

We introduce TeaVaR (Traffic Engineering Applying Value at Risk), a system that implements this risk management approach to traffic engineering (TE). We compare TeaVaR with state-of-the-art TE solutions through extensive simulations across various network topologies, failure scenarios, and traffic patterns, including benchmarks extrapolated from Microsoft’s WAN. Our results show that with TeaVaR, operators can support up to twice the throughput of existing TE schemes at the same level of availability.

## Introduction
Traffic engineering (TE), the dynamic adjustment of traffic splitting across network paths, is fundamental to networking and has received extensive attention in various contexts [1, 2, 8, 21, 27, 29, 31, 34, 35, 38, 43, 57]. Given the high cost of wide-area backbone networks (WANs), large service providers (e.g., Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft) are heavily investing in optimizing their WAN TE, leveraging Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to globally optimize routing and bandwidth allocation to users [27, 29, 37, 42, 43].

A crucial challenge for WAN operators is striking a good balance between network utilization and availability in the presence of node/link failures [5, 25, 28, 43, 48]. These two objectives are inherently at odds; providing high availability requires keeping network utilization sufficiently low to absorb shifts in traffic when failures occur. To achieve high availability, today’s backbone networks typically operate at fairly low utilization to meet user traffic demands while maintaining high availability (e.g., 99%+ [28]) in the presence of failures.

Figure 1 illustrates the link utilization of two IP links in a North American backbone network with the same source location but different destinations. The utilization of each link is normalized by the maximum achieved link utilization. On August 4, Link1 failed, and its utilization dropped to zero, increasing the utilization of Link2. However, under normal conditions, the normalized utilization of Link2 is only around 20%, making it underutilized most of the time. While network utilization can be increased by sending low-priority background traffic over underutilized links, this does not improve network utilization for high-priority traffic, which is the focus of this paper (§6).

![Link Utilization](path_to_image)

We demonstrate that state-of-the-art TE schemes fail to maximize the traffic load that can be supported by the WAN for the desired level of availability (§5). Under these schemes, the ratio of the bandwidth allocated to users to the available capacity must be kept lower than necessary, resulting in needlessly low network utilization. We argue that to address this, operators should explicitly optimize network utilization subject to target availability thresholds. Current TE schemes do not explicitly consider availability. Instead, the number of concurrent link/node failures the TE configuration can withstand (e.g., by sending traffic on link-disjoint network paths) is sometimes used as a proxy for availability. However, the failure probability of a single link can vary greatly, sometimes by three orders of magnitude [23]. Consequently, some failure scenarios involving two links might be more probable than others involving a single link. Alternatively, some failure scenarios might have negligible probability, and lowering network utilization to accommodate them is wasteful and has no meaningful impact on availability.

Operators have high visibility into failure patterns and dynamics. For example, link failures are more probable during working hours [25] and can be predicted based on sudden drops in optical signal quality, with a 50% chance of an outage within an hour of a drop event and a 70% chance of an outage within one day [23]. We posit that this wealth of timely empirical data on node/link failures in the WAN should be exploited to explicitly reason about the probability of different failure scenarios when optimizing TE. We present TeaVaR (Traffic Engineering Applying Value at Risk), a TE optimization framework that enables operators to harness this information to tune the tradeoff between network utilization and availability, thus striking a balance that best suits their goals. To our knowledge, TeaVaR is the first formal TE framework that enables operators to jointly optimize network utilization and availability. We refer the reader to Section 7 for a discussion of related work on TE, capacity planning, and other risk-aware approaches to networking.

Under TeaVaR, a probabilistic model of failure scenarios is first generated from empirical data. Then, TE optimization that draws on the notion of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) [50] minimization is applied to assign bandwidth shares to network users. TeaVaR enables formulating guarantees such as “user i is guaranteed bi network bandwidth at least β% of the time,” and computing bandwidth assignments that achieve these guarantees for a specified value of β.

To realize this approach to TE, we address the algorithmic challenges of formulating CVaR-based TE, such as how to achieve fairness across network users, and also with various operational challenges, such as ensuring that the running time of our algorithm scales well with the size and complexity of the network. Specifically, we cast the CVaR-based TE as a Linear Program (LP) with a manageable number of constraints for realistic network topologies, enabling the efficient computation of optimal TE solutions.

To evaluate TeaVaR, we conduct extensive simulations, comparing its performance with that of other TE systems across a variety of scenarios, traffic matrices, and topologies. We analyze the failure data collected from the inter-datacenter backbone network of Microsoft, consisting of time-to-failure and failure duration of links over a year at 15-minute granularity. We compute the failure probability for individual links and for Shared Risk Groups (SRGs) [54] corresponding to correlated link failures. We then apply these probability distributions to various network topologies, including ATT, B4, IBM, and Microsoft.

Our results show that with TeaVaR, the operator can support up to twice as much traffic as with state-of-the-art TE schemes, at the same level of availability. Importantly, TeaVaR, which optimizes how user traffic is split across network tunnels, can be coupled with any scheme for WAN tunnel selection, including oblivious routing [38], k-shortest paths, and link-disjoint routes. We also show that our optimization is fairly robust to inaccuracies in failure probability estimations. Indeed, a surprising takeaway from our evaluation results is that as long as the probabilistic failure model used is within 20% of actual failure probabilities, the optimization results in roughly only a 6% error in loss calculation.

To enable the community to explore our ideas and to facilitate the reproducibility of our results, our code is available online.1 This work does not raise any ethical issues.

## Motivating TeaVaR
The number of concurrent node/link failures a TE configuration can withstand is sometimes used as a proxy for availability. This can be manifested, e.g., in sending user traffic on multiple network paths (tunnels) that do not share any, or share only a few, links, or in splitting traffic across paths in a manner resilient to a certain number of concurrent link failures, as advocated in [43]. In this section, we explain why reasoning about availability in terms of the number of concurrent failures that can be tolerated is often not enough. We demonstrate this using the recently proposed Forward Fault Correction (FFC) TE scheme [43].

### FFC as an Illustration
FFC maximizes bandwidth allocation to be robust for up to k concurrent link failures, for a configurable value k. To accomplish this, FFC optimization sets a cap on the maximum bandwidth bi each network flow i (identified by source/destination pair) can utilize and generates routing (and rerouting) rules, such that the network can simultaneously support bi bandwidth for each flow i in any failure scenario that involves at most k failures.

We illustrate FFC in Figure 2, where source node s is connected to destination node d via three links, each of capacity 10Gbps. Suppose the objective is to support the maximum total amount of traffic from s to d in a manner that is resilient to at most two concurrent link failures. Figure 2(b) presents the optimal solution under FFC: rate-limiting the (s, d) flow to send at 10Gbps and always splitting traffic equally between all links that are intact; e.g., when no link failures occur, traffic is sent at 10/3 Gbps on each link, when a single link failure occurs, each of the two surviving links carries 5Gbps, and with two link failures, all traffic is sent on the single surviving link. Thus, this solution guarantees the flow-reserved bandwidth of 10Gbps without exceeding link capacities under any failure scenario that involves at most two failed links. However, this comes at the cost of keeping each link underutilized (one-third utilization) when no failures occur.

### Striking the Right Balance
We ask whether high availability can be achieved without such drastic over-provisioning. Approaches such as FFC are compelling in that they provide strong availability guarantees; in Figure 2(b), the (s, d) flow is guaranteed a total bandwidth of 10Gbps even if two links become permanently unavailable. Suppose, however, that the availability, i.e., the fraction of time a link is up, is consistently 99.9% for each of the three links. In this scenario, the network can easily support 30Gbps throughput (3× improvement over FFC) around 99.9% of the time simply by utilizing the full bandwidth of each link and never rerouting traffic.

This example captures the limitations of failure probability-agnostic approaches to TE, such as FFC; specifically, they ignore the underlying link availability (and the derived probability of failure). As discussed in [23, 25], link availability varies greatly across different links. Consequently, probability-oblivious TE solutions might lead to low network efficiency under prevailing conditions to accommodate potentially highly unlikely failure scenarios (i.e., with little bearing on availability). However, not only might a probability-oblivious approach overemphasize unlikely failure scenarios, it might even disregard likely failure scenarios. Consider a scenario where three links in a large network have low availability (say, 99% each), and all other links have extremely high availability (say, 99.999%). When the operator’s objective is to withstand two concurrent link failures, the scenario where the three less available links might be simultaneously unavailable will not be considered, whereas much less likely scenarios in which two of the highly available links fail simultaneously will be considered.

To motivate our risk-management approach, we revisit the example in Figure 2. Now, suppose the probability of a link being up is as described in the figure, and the link failure probabilities are uncorrelated (we will discuss correlated failures in §4). In this case, the probability of different failure scenarios can be expressed in terms of individual links’ failure probabilities (e.g., the probability of all three links failing simultaneously is 10−7). Under these failure probabilities, the network can support 30Gbps traffic almost 90% of the time simply by utilizing the full bandwidth of each link and not rerouting traffic in the event of failures. FFC’s solution, shown in Figure 2(b), can be regarded as corresponding to the objective of maximizing the throughput for a level of availability in the order of 7 nines (99.99999%), as the scenario of all links failing concurrently occurs with probability 10−7. Observe that the bandwidth assignment in Figure 3(b) guarantees a total throughput of 20Gbps at a 99.8% availability level, which is a more balanced and practical approach.

## Conclusion
TeaVaR provides a novel and effective approach to balancing network utilization and availability in WAN traffic engineering. By leveraging empirical data and probabilistic models, TeaVaR enables operators to optimize network resources while meeting their availability targets. Our simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art TE solutions demonstrate that TeaVaR can significantly enhance network throughput without compromising availability. We believe that TeaVaR represents a significant step forward in the field of traffic engineering and offers a practical solution to the challenges faced by WAN operators.
