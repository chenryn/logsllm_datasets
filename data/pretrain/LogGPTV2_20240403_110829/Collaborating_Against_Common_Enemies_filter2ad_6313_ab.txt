Inter-arrival times of alerts from same source
Figure 2: CDF of inter-arrival times of consecu-
tive alerts from a source in minutes. The CDF is
taken over the inter-arrival times. 95% of consecu-
tive alerts from a source arrive within 10 minutes of
each other, the rest are separated by several hours.
A few limitations are worth mentioning. Except for
the ISP logs, the other IDSs in the logs are largely inde-
pendent. We do not have access to their conﬁgurations,
and hence we do not know the signature sets they em-
ploy, or even the platforms they use. This means that
some of the attack correlation may be hidden because
of diﬀerences between IDS signature sets. Second, we
do not have information about the nature or the busi-
ness of the protected networks, and thus cannot tell
whether these issues play a role in attack correlation.
2.2 Method
Before studying attack correlation, we clean the data
from obvious false positives, and analyze it to ﬁnd a
meaningful deﬁnition of the term “attack correlation”.
2.2.1 Filtering
IDS logs are prone to ﬂooding with alerts, many of
which are innocuous alarms. For example, the ISP
and University data sets contain innocuous alarms trig-
gered by misconﬁgurations, P2P applications like eDon-
key, malformed HTTP packets etc. Many of these were
already ﬂagged as false positives by the security admin-
istrators of the ISP. Since these are not actual attacks,
they do not help in detecting attack correlation among
diﬀerent sites. Hence we ﬁlter out known false positives
from the ISP and universities logs. We consider all the
remaining alerts to be parts of valid attacks. Of course
we cannot do this for the DSHIELD dataset, since we
do not know the nature of the alert.

Figure 3: CDF of the size of the correlation groups
for diﬀerent deﬁnitions of attack correlation for the
ISP and U1 datasets. The CDFs are taken over the
IDSs. They show that the correlation is insensi-
tive to the additional information obtained from the
alert type and port, and can be discovered based
solely on source IP.
CDF of inter-arrival times of consecutive alerts from
the same source at an IDS in Figure 2. The CDF shows
that 90% of the alerts from a source arrive within a
minute of each other, these are likely to belong to the
same attack event. The knee in the CDF happens at
10 minutes, inter-arrival times larger than 10 minutes
are spread out to several hours. We pick 10 minutes as
the window because about 95% of the alerts from the
same source arrive separated by less than 10 minutes
and the other 5% have widely-spread interarrivals.
2.2.3 Deﬁning Attack Correlation
How should one deﬁne attack correlation? Should all
ﬁelds in the alerts received at diﬀerent IDSs be the
same, or is it enough to consider one or two ﬁelds?
Furthermore, how long can the interval between the
two attacks at two diﬀerent IDSs be for them to be
still considered correlated?
Attack correlation can be parameterized by the set
of correlated header ﬁelds and the time window used
to compute the correlation. We deﬁne two attacks to
be correlated if they share the source IP address and
start within 10 minutes of each other. Both choices
are based on detailed analysis of the data that showed
almost no sensitivity to including additional ﬁelds in
the correlation beyond the source IP and using time
windows larger than 10 minutes. Below we describe
this analysis in detail.
To carry out this study, we need to extract attacks from
IDS logs. We consider a stream of suspicious packets
from the same source to an IDS with an inter-arrival
smaller than 10 minutes as an attack. Below we explain
why a separation window of 10 minutes is reasonable.
To ﬁnd a meaningful separation window, we plot a
(a) Picking the correlation ﬁelds: Deﬁning attack
correlation based on the destination IP address is not
useful since attacks seen by a particular IDS will have
their destinations in the local network. Also the source
port is likely to be picked randomly and is not useful
for deﬁning attack correlation.

We consider the following deﬁnitions of correlated
attacks: 1) source based, 2) source and the destination
port combined, 3) source and alert type combined, 4)
source, alert type, and destination port combined, 5)
and source subnet based. We conduct this analysis for
the ISP dataset and the U1 datasets, for which we have
access to all these ﬁelds.
Since our main interest is to ﬁnd who is correlated
with whom, we consider how diﬀerent attack correla-
tion deﬁnitions aﬀect the size of the correlation group
of a IDS (see Table 1). Correlated groups are explained
further in §3, but for the purposes of this analysis they
are simply the set of IDSs with which a particular IDS
shares correlated attacks.
Figure 3 plots the cumulative distribution functions
(CDFs) of the size of the correlation group of an IDS.
Diﬀerent CDFs correspond to diﬀerent correlation ﬁelds.
The ﬁgure shows that, except for the CDF for source
subnets, all the other CDFs are very close together.
Classiﬁcation based on the attacking source subnet re-
sults in slightly higher correlation, but the diﬀerence
is not substantial. Further, classifying based on source
subnet carries the danger of blacklisting an entire sub-
net resulting in innocent sources being blocked. Since
including extra ﬁelds in the deﬁnition of correlation in
addition to the source IP has no signiﬁcant impact on
the correlation CDF, we deﬁne attack correlation based
solely on the similarity of the oﬀending source IP.
The above leads to an interesting result: performing
attack correlation analysis requires minimal informa-
tion, namely attack time and oﬀending source IP.
(b) Picking the maximum time window between
correlated attacks: Unless stated diﬀerently, a 10
minute window is used for determining correlated at-
tacks at diﬀerent IDSs. We tried diﬀerent time win-
dows in the [5, 30] minutes range. Windows less than 10
minutes resulted in decreased attack correlation while
there was not much diﬀerence for windows greater than
10. Hence we picked the minimum window possible
i.e., 10 minutes. Thus, if two attacks at two IDSs start
within 10 minutes of each other, then they are consid-
ered correlated.
(c) Correlation threshold: We say that two IDSs
are correlated if more than 10% of their attacks are
correlated. We justify the threshold below. We com-
pute the CDF of correlation taken over all IDSs with
non-empty groups (i.e., IDSs that are correlated with
at least one other IDS). For 90% of the IDS, the correla-
tion (percentage of correlated attacks w.r.t all attacks)
was higher than 10% ranging upto 57%. For the re-
maining 10% of the IDS, the correlation was slightly
higher than 0%. Such small values are due to a few
attacks being shared and do not reﬂect any signiﬁcant

No. of source IP addresses per day per IDS
Figure 4: Prevalence of common attackers. Figure
shows the CDFs of the average number of common
attackers and local attackers per day per IDS. A
common attacker is a source IP that is ﬂagged as
suspicious at two or more IDSs. 90% of the studied
IDSs see more than 100 common attacking IPs per
day. The average number of common attacking IPs
at an IDS is about 1,500 while the maximum can
be as large as 25,000.
correlation between the two IDSs.
3 EXTENT OF ATTACK CORRELATION
3.1 Do IDSs see common attackers?
A common attacker is an IP address that generates
alerts at two or more IDSs. We compute the average
number of common and uncommon attacking IP ad-
dresses for each IDS per day. Figure 4 compares the
CDF of common attackers with the uncommon/local
ones. The CDF is taken over all IDSs. The graphs
show that on average an IDS sees 1500 shared oﬀend-
ing IPs per day, and 6000 unshared oﬀenders. Thus,
about 20% of the suspicious source IP addresses ob-
served at an IDS are also seen at some other IDS in
the dataset. These common source IP addresses ac-
count for 40% of all alerts in the logs. Thus, correlated
attacks happen quite often and constitute a substantial
fraction of all attacks.
3.2 How many victims does a common at-
tacker attack?
The previous section quantiﬁed how many source IP
addresses at each IDS are common attackers, here we
focus on the number of victims of a common attacker.
Figure 5 plots the CDF of the number of IDSs targeted
by a common attacker. The CDF is taken over all com-
mon attacker IPs. On the average, a common attacker
appears at 10 IDSs, which is about 0.6% of all IDSs in
the dataset. The high average of 10 victims seems to
comply with recent trends in using botnets to mount
multiple attacks against many target networks [25].
3.3 Time Between Correlated Attacks
How long does it take a common attacker before he
attacks the next network? If this time is long then

Inter-arrival distribution of correlated attacks from same source in mins
Figure 6: Figure shows the CDF of the interarrival
times of correlated attacks at diﬀerent IDSs. More
than 75% of the correlated attacks arrive within 10
minutes of each other. This emphasizes the need
for realtime exchange of attack data.
the exchange of alert data can be oﬄine, but if it is
short then eﬀective collaboration against common at-
tackers requires realtime exchange of information. We
compute interarrival times of attacks from the same
source at multiple IDSs, i.e., the diﬀerence between
when the ﬁrst time the attacker is observed at diﬀer-
ent IDSs. Figure 6 shows the CDF of these interarrival
times. More than 75% of the time, a common attacker
attacks the next IDS within 10 minutes from the pre-
vious IDS. Attackers therefore mount multiple attacks
