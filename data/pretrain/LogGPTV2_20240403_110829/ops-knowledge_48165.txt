User: How to use Cron to execute tasks regularly on the Linux system?
Assistant: The steps for using Cron to execute tasks on a Linux system are as follows: 1. Write scripts or commands to execute tasks that need to be executed regularly. 2. Use the crontab command to open the cron scheduled task configuration file. Enter the `crontab -e` command in the terminal to edit the cron configuration file. 3. Add the scheduled tasks to be executed in the cron configuration file. Each scheduled task should have one line, the format is as follows: ``` * * * * * command ``` Among them, 5 asterisks indicate the time setting for scheduled execution, which respectively represent minutes, hours, days, months, and days of the week ;command indicates the command or script to be executed. For example, the following configuration indicates that the task will be executed at 1:30 am every day: ``` 30 1 * * * /path/to/command ``` 4. Save the cron configuration file and exit. 5. After the scheduled task takes effect, cron will periodically execute the command or script that needs to be executed according to the set time. You can use the crontab command to view a list of all current scheduled tasks, and delete or modify an existing scheduled task. Note: 1. The current user needs to have permission to execute commands or scripts. 2. Scripts or commands executed by cron should use absolute paths, otherwise path mismatches may occur. 3. The time setting of the cron scheduled task uses UTC (Universal Standard Time), and needs to be adjusted accordingly according to the local time zone and daylight saving time.
