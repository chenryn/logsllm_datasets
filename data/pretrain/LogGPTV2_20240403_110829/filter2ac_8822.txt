title:blackhat:us-22 Whip the Whisperer: Simulating Side Channel Leakage
Cryptographic side channels are well-understood from a mathematical perspective, and many countermeasures exist that reduce leakage. Yet, there are many implementations in the field that leak. This is caused by a combination of lack of security experts, the fact that upon implementation countermeasures can become leaky, and the absence of good pre-silicon side channel analysis tools. In this presentation, we show how common hardware design tools can be used to perform pre-silicon power simulations, and how that can be used to detect leaky implementations. We show a case study of how countermeasure implementations that look fine in source are actually leaky, and how simulation can help pinpoint individual leaky elements, both in software and hardware. There are surprising results where non-related software instructions leak, caused by microarchitectural interactions in the CPU pipeline. Armed with all this knowledge, those issues can be fixed. This talk is interesting for hardware and software designers to see how tools can be used to pinpoint leakage down to the gate or code level, and for researchers in finding new side channels due to processor design.
