ABSTRACT
Mobile security and privacy issues are receiving signiﬁcant
attention from the research community. The SPSM work-
shop was created to provide a venue for researchers and
practitioners interested in such issues to get together and ex-
change ideas. Following the success of the previous editions,
we present the sixth edition of the workshop. It brings to-
gether the expertise of an international program committee,
comprising of 22 mobile security experts from the academia
and the industry. The workshop received 31 submissions
(regular and short papers combined) from a diverge set of
authors located in 19 countries.
1. MOTIVATION
Mobile devices such as smartphones and Internet tablets
have achieved computing and networking capabilities com-
parable to traditional personal computers. Their successful
consumerization has also become a source of pain for adopt-
ing users and organizations. For example, the widespread
presence of information-stealing applications raises substan-
tial security and privacy concerns. The operating systems
supporting these new devices have both advantages and dis-
advantages with respect to security. On one hand, they use
application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit privi-
leges given to malware. On the other hand, they routinely
collect and organize many forms of security- and privacy-
sensitive information and make that information easily ac-
cessible to third-party applications.
2. TOPICS
Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as an emerg-
ing area, this workshop intends to provide a venue for inter-
ested researchers and practitioners to get together and ex-
change ideas. Topics of interest include (but are not limited
to) the following subject categories:
• Device/hardware security
• OS/middleware security

• Application security
• Authenticating users to devices and services
• Mobile web browsers
• Usability
• Privacy
• Rogue application detection and recovery
• Vulnerability detection and remediation
• Secure application development
• Cloud support for mobile security
• Mobile device management
• Mobile ads
• Dual persona management and isolation
We also encourage novel paradigms and controversial ideas
that are not on the above list. The workshop is to act
as a venue for creative debate and interaction in security-
and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and communica-
tion impacted by smartphones. We favor submissions that
are radical, forward-looking, and open-ended, as opposed to
mature work on the verge of conference or journal publica-
tion; in SPSM 2016, we reduced the page length requirement
to encourage such submissions (e.g., 8–10 pages for regular
papers, instead of 12 pages). Submissions that discuss a
real-world problem without a solution are encouraged.

We thank all the authors who submitted their work to the
workshop. We acknowledge and greatly appreciate the time
and eﬀort as put forward by the PC members and exter-
nal reviewers. We would also like to thank the 2016 ACM
CCS organizers, speciﬁcally, the workshop co-Chairs Math-

6. PC CO-CHAIRS
Long Lu is an assistant professor of computer science at
Stony Brook University. He directs the RiS3 Lab and is
a core member of the National Security Institute at Stony
Brook. He earned his PhD in computer science from Geor-
gia Tech in 2013. Lu’s research aims at protecting soft-
ware, systems, and their users against critical or emerging
threats. Focused on securing mobile apps and operating
systems, Lu’s recent work has produced comprehensive app
vulnerability checkers, in-app security enforcement mecha-
nisms, and new security primitives and designs for mobile
OS, which were published at the top security and systems
conferences, including CCS, S&P, USENIX Security, NDSS,
and MobiSys.
Mohammad Mannan is an associate professor at the
Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering,
Concordia University, Montreal. He has a Ph.D. in Com-
puter Science from Carleton University (2009) in the area of
Internet authentication and usable security. He was a post-
doctoral fellow at the University of Toronto from 2009 to
2011. His research interests lie in the area of Internet and
systems security, with a focus on solving high-impact secu-
rity and privacy problems of today’s Internet. He is involved
in several well-known conferences (e.g., program committee:
ACM CCS 2016, ACSAC 2014, USENIX Security 2010), and
journals (e.g., ACM TISSEC, IEEE TDSC, IEEE TIFS).
