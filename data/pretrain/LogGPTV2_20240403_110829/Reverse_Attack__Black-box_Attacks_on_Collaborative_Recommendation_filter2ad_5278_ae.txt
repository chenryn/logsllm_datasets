10 recommendations on ml-100k and am-d, where SV D, ALS, and
BPR indicate the results of RandomA attack while SV DA, ALSA,
and BPRA indicate our availability attack results respectively under
the SV D, ALS, and BPR algorithms. The numerical values corre-
sponding to the figures are also listed in Appendix A.4. We observe
that our availability attacks on three algorithms greatly outper-
form RandomA under both datasets. Specifically, under ml-100k (or
am-d), the PRE@10 values of our availability attacks on SV D, ALS,
and BPR reach 24.34%, 29.33%, 33.26% (or 45.82%, 53.14%, 57.74%),
respectively, when f r increases to 5%. In addition, our availability
attack performs better even with only 2% fake users injected than
RandomA attack with 5% fakes users injected.

We next examine our target attack on SV D, ALS, and BPR, com-
paring its results with those of RandomT , Averaдe, Bandwaдon,
PGAT , and SGLDT attack methods. Our experiments are still con-
ducted under the ml-100k and am-d datasets for evaluation. Table 7
lists the HR@10 results of our target attack and of the other five
attack methods under SV D, ALS, and BPR algorithms, when f r
increases from 0.1% to 5%. According to those table columns, our
attack is seen to perform far better than RandomT , Averaдe, and
Bandwaдon, for both datasets. It performs a little bit inferior to
PGAT and SGLDT for both datasets, but notably PGAT and SGLDT
are of white-box attacks, requiring full knowledge on underlying
recommendation algorithms, dataset, and item relationships infor-
mation as exhibited in Table 4, deemed impractical for real-world
attacks. Also, PGAT and SGLDT are limited to only attacking the
Matrix Factorization-based CF algorithm. In contrast, our attack
belongs to the black-box ones, applicable to various categories of
CF algorithms.
Attack Performance on NN-based CF (i.e., NCF, CML, DCF,
and FAST ). Figures 6(a) and 6(b) depict the results of our avail-
ability attack and RandomA for NCF, CML, DCF, and FAST under
ml-1m and am-b, where NCF, CML, DCF, and FAST indicate the
results of RandomA whereas NCFT , CMLT , DCFT , and FASTT rep-
resent the results of our availability attack. The numerical values
corresponding to the two figures are also listed in Appendix A.5.
We can see that our availability attacks always beat RandomA under
both datasets. Specifically, in ml-1m, our method achieves the best
result (i.e., NCFA) when attacking the NCF algorithm, with the
maximum PRE@10 value of 39.01%. Here, the required fake users
amount is only 302, giving rise to the total number of users to be
6040 as shown in Table 10 in Appendix A.2. In am-d, the best result
is achieved by CMLA when attacking the CML algorithm, with the

maximum PRE@10 value of 66.72%. Our method performs worse
on FAST for both datasets, but its PRE@10 values still reach 23.04%
and 42.18%, respectively, for the attack ratio f r = 5%. On the other
hand, RandomA achieves the best attack performance (i.e., NCF)
under both datasets when attacking the NCF algorithm among all.
But its PRE@10 values are still far less than those of our attack on
all four algorithms.
Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the results of target attack under
NCF, CML, DCF, and FAST in ml-1m and am-b, respectively. The
respective numerical values can be found in Appendix A.6. All
HR@10 values of RandomT , Averaдe, and Bandwaдon on attacking
NCF, CML, DCF, and FAST algorithms fall into the red shaded area.
Clearly, our target attack beats all three other attacks under both
datasets. Our method achieves the best results (i.e., CMLT ) when
attacking the CML algorithm, with the maximum HR@10 values of
31.26% and 53.08%, respectively, for the attack ratio f r = 5%. Our
target attack performs the worst on FAST under both datasets, but
it still has the HR@10 values of 18.64% and 36.62%, respectively.
Other baseline target attacks yeild the best HR@10 values under
two datasets equal to only 10.54% and 11.37%, respectively, even
