### Target Attack Performance on NN-based CF (NCF, CML, DCF, and FAST)

- **ML-1M Dataset**
  - NCF: HR@10 = 31.26%
  - CML: HR@10 = 53.08%
  - DCF: HR@10 = 18.64%
  - FAST: HR@10 = 36.62%

- **AM-B Dataset**
  - NCF: HR@10 = 31.26%
  - CML: HR@10 = 53.08%
  - DCF: HR@10 = 18.64%
  - FAST: HR@10 = 36.62%

### Observations
- Our availability attacks on three algorithms (SV D, ALS, and BPR) significantly outperform RandomA under both datasets.
- Specifically, under ml-100k (or am-d), the PRE@10 values of our availability attacks on SV D, ALS, and BPR reach 24.34%, 29.33%, and 33.26% (or 45.82%, 53.14%, and 57.74%), respectively, when the attack ratio increases to 5%.
- Our method performs better even with only 2% fake users injected compared to RandomA with 5% fake users.

- **Figure 7**: Results of target attack under NCF, CML, DCF, and FAST in ml-1m and am-b, respectively.

### Conclusion
- Our target attack outperforms RandomT, Averaдe, and Bandwaдon for both datasets.
- It performs slightly worse than PGAT and SGLDT, but these methods are white-box attacks requiring full knowledge of the underlying recommendation algorithms, dataset, and item relationships, which is impractical for real-world attacks.
- Our black-box attack is applicable to various categories of CF algorithms, making it more practical and effective.
