It appears that you are experiencing a "HTTP 400 Bad Request" error after making changes to the `local_settings.py` file and restarting the Horizon service. Even after reverting the changes and restarting the service, the issue persists.

To help resolve this, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Check Log Files:**
   - Examine the Apache or HTTPD log files for more detailed error messages. These logs can provide clues about what might be causing the 400 Bad Request error.
   - For CentOS, the log files are typically located in `/var/log/httpd/` or `/var/log/apache2/`.

2. **Review `local_settings.py` Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in the `local_settings.py` file is correctly configured. This setting should include the IP address or hostname of your OpenStack controller.
   - Example configuration:
     ```python
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['XX.XX.XX.XX', 'ControllerName', 'localhost']
     ```
   - Replace `XX.XX.XX.XX` with the actual IP address of your controller and `ControllerName` with the hostname.

3. **Restart Services:**
   - After making any changes, restart the Horizon service to apply the new configuration:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl restart httpd
     ```

4. **Verify Network and Firewall Settings:**
   - Ensure that there are no network or firewall issues preventing access to the OpenStack UI.
   - Check if the port used by the Horizon service (usually 80 or 443) is open and accessible.

If the issue still persists after following these steps, please provide the relevant log entries for further analysis.
