User: I have OpenStack UI running. I made some changes in the local-setting.py file and restarted the Horizon service using service httpd restart and try to hit OpenStack UI but it returns an error: "HTTP 400 Bad request".
When I revert back all changes, restart the service and try again the error is still there.
Please help me !!
Assistant: Total agree with above comments, check your apache or httpd log files.
Most probably error cause due to improper info.
added (for centos)  under below file.
/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['XX.XX.XX.XX', 'ControllerName', 'localhost']
Hopefully this will resolve issue.
