### Issue Report: Illegal Reflective Access Warnings in Neo4j 4.0

#### Environment
- **Neo4j Version:** 4.0
- **Operating System:** Official Docker Container on Linux

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the Neo4j Docker container.

#### Expected Behavior
The startup process should not display any warnings related to illegal reflective access.

#### Actual Behavior
Upon starting the Neo4j Docker container, the following warnings are displayed:

```
Starting Neo4j.
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.FieldUtils (file:/var/lib/neo4j/lib/commons-lang3-3.9.jar) to field sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.fd
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.FieldUtils
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
```

#### Summary
The presence of these warnings during the startup of Neo4j 4.0 is unexpected and may indicate potential issues with the use of internal APIs. These warnings should ideally be resolved to ensure a clean and stable startup process.
