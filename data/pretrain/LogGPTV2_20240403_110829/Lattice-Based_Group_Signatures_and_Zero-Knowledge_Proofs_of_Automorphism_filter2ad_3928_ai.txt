8 Parameters and Implementation
8.1 Fixing the Parameters
We will set the parameters as per Table 5. In this section we discuss the bounds that must be
veriﬁed by these parameters and the resulting security guarantees. We will consider the security of
our scheme in terms of ”root-hermite factor” δ0 which is a parameter often used when assessing the
security of lattice-based schemes. In this section we will aim for a root-hermite factor δ0 = 1.0036.
Such a factor implies at least 93-bit (post-quantum) space hardness or 242-bit time hardness (and
signiﬁcantly smaller space-hardness) depending on which lattice reduction strategy one uses.
First we ﬁx the dimension to d = 4096, we use this dimension as anything smaller does not
allow the existence of parameters that make our scheme secure. For this dimension the challenge
set {c ∈ R : (cid:107)c(cid:107)1 = κ,(cid:107)c(cid:107)∞ = 1} will be of size greater than 2256 if we ﬁx κ = 26.
√
r = 2 · 1.17
√
The standard deviations s and r are ﬁxed by the quality of our trapdoors to s = 6
dq2 and
q2.
To ﬁx q1 we consider the requirements on the binding property of our commitment. From
√
Section 5 we have that the M-SISq1,1,3,4κB problem has to be hard for vectors of norm 4κB =
88 · κ2 · d
BS = (cid:107)˜z − s∗(cid:107) ≈ 180224 · √
To ﬁx q2 we will need the M-SISq2,1,4,BS for BS as per lemma 6.5 to be hard. We can compute that
q2 for q2 ≈ 280 as in table 5 the root-hermite factor of this
200. For q1 ≈ 230, as in table 5, we obtain δ0 = 1.0036.
2 · d2 · √
problem will be δ0 = 1.0036.
33
The value of q2 also aﬀects the hardness of the hiding property of our commitment scheme. For
this, we need that R-LWE is hard for dimension d, errors sampled in S1 and both modulus q1 and
q2. In practice the best attack will be to either solve R-LWE modulo q1 or modulo q2. Since we will
have q2 > q1 and the hardness of R-LWE decreases as the modulus increases, we will only consider
q2 as being relevant here. For the parameters in table 5 we have δ0 = 1.0036 for R-LWE with modulo
q2, which is set intentionally to be the same as the root-hermite factor for the M-SIS problem above.
The only constraint we have on p, the plaintext modulus of our veriﬁable encryption scheme, is
that if ¯r˜c = ˜r¯c mod p for some ¯r, ¯c, ˜r, ˜c extracted in ΠSign then this equation should hold over the
integers, i.e. (cid:107)¯z˜c − ˜z¯c(cid:107)∞ ≤ p/2. Since the vector z output in ΠSign will have coeﬃcients distributed
according to Dξ, we will have with overwhelming probability that (cid:107)z(cid:107)∞ ≤ 12ξ (we can add this as
an explicit check in the veriﬁcation algorithm), in which case we will require p ≥ 4 · κ · 12ξ ≥ 226.5.
The ciphertext modulus Q will be ﬁxed by equation 16 which gives:
√
Q ≥ 264
34κpd3/2 ≥ 259.5
We consider the proof size that results from this parameter choice. The secret key consists of 4
polynomials of standard deviation s and two polynomials of standard deviation r resulting in a size
of 4d log(12s) + 2d log(12r) = 154KB. The signature itself will consist of two commitments, one
ciphertext and one zero-knowledge proof, which are respectively of size:
2d log q1 + 2d log q2 = 113KB
4d log Q = 123KB
13d log(12ξ) + 4d log(12ξ1) + 2d log(12ξ2) = 345KB
8.2 Accounting For Complexity Leveraging
The proof for full-traceability of Section 6.2 reduces the security of our group signature to that of
a selectively secure signature. When guessing the identity of the forgery, we thus lose a factor of q2
in the success probability of the attacker. The hardness of SIS is usually evaluated by considering
exponential time/exponential space algorithms (sieving algorithms) since such algorithms have
the best asymptotic complexity. While complexity leveraging implies that the running time of a
successful SIS challenger is multiplied by q2 it should not be aﬀected in terms of space complexity,
it is thus reasonable to consider the space complexity of the adversary as a lower bound on the
security of the scheme. To account for the loss in success probability we will also consider polynomial
space/exponential time algorithms (enumeration algorithms). For a root-hermite factor δ0 = 1.0036
enumeration estimates (e.g. [ACD+18,BCLvV]) give a post-quantum time complexity of 322 bits,
which when taking into account the loss of a factor q2 results in a security of 242 bits. For the sake of
completeness, we also give a very conservative second set of parameters in which the post-quantum
time and space complexity of sieving algorithms is above 128 bits even with complexity leveraging.
The dimension d = 4096 is no longer enough to reach such a security and we will thus be forced
to set d = 8192. For this dimension the M-SISq2,1,3,BS has a root hermite factor of δ0 = 1.002,
corresponding to a security of 207 bits in space and 262 bits in time for post-quantum security
using sieving (the post-quantum time security when considering enumeration is of 1084 bits with
leveraging). The R-LWE problem in dimension d = 8192 has a root-hermite factor of less than
1.0019 resulting in more than 300 bits of security, similarly the M-SISq1,1,3,4κB becomes harder
34
with a higher dimension and q1 can be reduced accordingly. The rest of the parameters will be
changed to the values given in Table 5, resulting in a signature size of (c.f. Table 4).
8.3
Implementation
We have implemented the group signature scheme in the C programming language. For the preimage
sampling during key generation we use the Fast Fourier version [DP16] of the randomized nearest
plane algorithm [GPV08] adapted to cyclotomic rings. This was done before in the Falcon signature
scheme [PFH+18]. We also use the FFT-based algorithm from [DP16] adapted to cyclotomic rings
to compute the compact LDL∗ decomposition of the trapdoor basis. Contrary to Falcon, double
ﬂoating point precision does not suﬃce in our case. For the necessary multiprecision complex
arithmetic we use the library MPC [EGTZ18] based on MPFR [FHL+07] and GMP [Gt16]. We
compute everything with 256 bits of precision. In the complex FFT we use Cooley-Tukey butterﬂies
in the forward transform, Gentleman-Sande butterﬂies in the inverse transform and no reordering.
The signing algorithm does not need multiprecision ﬂoating point arithmetic and is thus suitable
for small devices. It mainly requires multiprecision integer polynomial arithmetic which we have
implemented using the GMP integer multiprecision library. It is possible to optimize this part of
our code. For example in the zero-knowledge proofs of the commitment scheme we only need that
diﬀerences of challenges are invertible modulo the second prime q2. The ﬁrst prime q1 could thus
be chosen to be fully splitting and polynomial multiplications be computed with an NTT-based
algorithm. We obtain all randomness from the SHAKE-256 expandable output function [BDPVA13].
Table 1 lists the running times of the implementation. The time for key generation contains
the generation of the group public key and one member secret key. For further improvements, the
tree representing the L matrix of the compact LDL∗ decomposition of the trapdoor basis can be
precomputed, which would signiﬁcantly reduce the key generation time for each individual member.
