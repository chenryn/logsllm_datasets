Hunting Viruses in the Wild
Since 1990 we have been collecting virus statistics from a population of several 
hundred thousand PCs among our corporate customers. We record the location and 
date of each incident along with the number of infected PCs and diskettes and the 
identity of the virus. These statistics have permitted us to infer a good deal about 
the behavior of viruses in the wild, including the fact that only a small fraction of 
viruses are genuinely problematic. Only about 5 percent of all known viruses have 
been observed within the population we have studied, many of them just once. The 
10 most common viruses account for two thirds of all incidents. In addition, the 
prevalence of these successful viruses appears to follow a common pattern: a virus 
will spread over the course of a year or so, increasing its numbers in a roughly 
linear fashion until it reaches a plateau. After that, it will continue to appear in 
computers at a roughly constant level, although sometimes its numbers decline to 
near extinction.
In   an   effort   to   understand   these   characteristics,   we   have   borrowed   from 
mathematical models of biological epidemics. The simplest models predict the 
behavior of a disease from a few parameters--most significantly, the "birth rate" at 
which sick individuals infect others and the "death rate" at which the sick either die 
or are cured. If the ratio between these two rates is less than a critical value, any 
infection will quickly die out. The larger the ratio, the more likely an epidemic, and 
(if there is no immunity) the greater the fraction of the population that will be 
infected at any one time.
Our observations suggest that such a simplistic view is inadequate. Unless the 
ratio of the birth and death rates just happens to be close to the critical value, a 
virus should either die out completely or spread exponentially and become almost 
universal. Instead many viruses persist steadily at levels that are a small fraction of 
the overall population. One crucial error in this simple model appears to be in 
assuming uniform chances of contact among everyone in the population at risk. 
More sophisticated models take into  account  the extraordinary  cliquishness  of 
typical patterns of software exchange. Each person shares software and data only 
with a few other people, on average, and most of the sharing takes place within 
groups. If Alice shares with Bob and Bob shares with Carol, then Alice and Carol 
are reasonably likely to share with each other.
Computer simulations have shown that  locality of contact  slows  the  initial 
growth  in  a way  that  is qualitatively consistent with  our observations. Sparse 
sharing reduces the likelihood of an epidemic and lowers the plateau, but not by 
enough to explain the data.
Evolution in Action
Just as external factors such as drought, sanitation and migration have a strong 
influence  on  biological   epidemics,   changes  in   the  computing   environment   are 
responsible for the presence of several distinct epochs in viral infection. Until 
1992,   reported  sightings  of  file-infecting  viruses   and   boot   viruses  occurred   at 
roughly equal (and steadily rising) rates. Then the incidence rate for file infectors 
began to fall dramatically, whereas that for boot-sector infectors continued to rise. 
Between late 1992 and late 1995, boot-sector infectors reigned supreme. Why did 
the file infectors essentially become extinct?
We  believe  the  cause  was  the  widespread   acceptance   of  Windows  3.1,   an 
enhancement to MS-DOS -- the operating system used on most computers -- that 
became popular around 1992. Windows crashes readily in the presence of typical 
file viruses, and so necessity will lead afflicted users somehow to eliminate the 
virus from their systems (perhaps by wiping out the hard disk and reinstalling all 
the software), regardless of whether they know that the symptoms are caused by a 
virus. Boot viruses, in contrast, tend to coexist peacefully with Windows 3.1; they 
do not kill their hosts before the infection has a chance to run riot.
The wide use of Windows 95, yet another new operating system, has now led to 
a precipitous decline in the prevalence of boot viruses. Windows 95 warns the user 
about most changes to boot sectors, including many of those caused by viruses, and 
most boot viruses cannot spread under Windows 95. We have already seen a 
handful of viruses specifically designed for Windows 95 and other 32-bit operating 
systems, although the ones we have seen are unlikely to become widespread.
We are now in the era of the macro virus. Because users tend to exchange 
documents and other data files capable of harboring macro viruses more frequently 
than they exchange programs, macro viruses enjoy a higher birth rate and thus 
spread faster than the traditional boot or file infectors. Sophisticated mail and file-
transfer functions now permit users to share documents or programs more quickly 
and easily than before, exacerbating the problem.
Macro   viruses   are   also   the   first   viruses   to   exploit   the   growing   trend   for 
interoperability   among   computers.   A   DOS   file   infector   can   never   endanger  a 
Macintosh, for instance, but a macro virus can infect any computer that supports a 
vulnerable   application   program.   The   fact   that   Microsoft   Word   runs   on   many 
different kinds of computers enables Concept and other macro viruses to move 
beyond traditional system boundaries.
A Digital Immune System
Today viruses mainly travel from one computer to another through intentional, 
manual exchange of programs, and human response time is generally sufficient to 
cope with them. A successful new virus typically takes months or even years to 
gain a foothold. In the densely connected world of the near future, viruses might be 
able to propagate much faster. As early as 1988, Robert Tappan Morris launched 
what came to be known as the "Internet Worm," a program that exploited security 
holes and invaded hundreds of computers around the world in less than a day.
New   technologies   (such   as   Web   browsers  that   use  "ActiveX")   for  silently 
downloading software and data to a user's computer make the problem even more 
pressing.   Already   modern-day   mail   programs   permit   text   documents   or 
spreadsheets to be sent very simply as e-mail attachments. Opening the attachment 
can cause the appropriate application to start up automatically, and any macro 
viruses contained in the attachment may be executed. Soon software agents may be 
routinely authorized to send and open mail containing attachments. With humans 
no longer participating in the replication cycle, viruses could be free to spread 
orders of magnitude faster than they do now.
These changes in the digital ecosystem suggest that a more automatic response 
to computer viruses is needed, one that is not limited by human response times or 
by the rate at which humans can dissect novel viruses. IBM, Symantec Corporation 
and McAfee Associates are among the companies developing technology to help 
respond quickly and automatically to new viruses.
At IBM, we are creating what may be thought of as an  immune system  for 
cyberspace. Just as the vertebrate immune system creates immune cells capable of 
fighting new pathogens within a few days of exposure, a computer immune system 
derives prescriptions for recognizing and removing newly encountered computer 
viruses within minutes. In a current prototype, PCs running  IBM AntiVirus  are 
connected by a network to a central computer that analyzes viruses. A monitoring 
program   on   each   PC   uses   a   variety   of   heuristics   based   on   system   behavior, 
suspicious changes to programs, or family signatures to infer that a virus may be 
present. The monitoring program makes a copy of any program thought to be 
infected and sends it over the network to the virus-analysis machine.
On receiving a putatively infected sample, the machine sends it to another 
computer that acts as a digital petri dish. Software on this test machine lures the 
virus into infecting specially designed "decoy" programs by executing, writing to, 
copying and otherwise manipulating the decoys. To replicate successfully, a virus 
must infect programs that are used often, and so the decoy activity brings the viral 
code out of hiding. Other behavioral characteristics of the virus can be inferred 
during this phase as well.
Any decoys that have been infected can now be analyzed by other components 
of   the   immune   system,   which   will   extract   viral   signatures   and   produce 
prescriptions for verifying and removing the virus. Typically it takes the virus 
analyzer less than five minutes to produce such prescriptions from an infected 
sample. The analysis machine sends this information back to the infected client PC, 
which incorporates it into a permanent database of cures for known viruses. The 
PC is then directed to locate and remove all instances of the virus, and it is 
permanently protected from subsequent encounters.
If the PC is connected to other machines on a local-area network, it is quite 
possible that the virus has invaded some of them as well. In our prototype, the new 
prescription is sent automatically to neighboring machines on the network, and 
each machine checks itself immediately. Because computer viruses can exploit the 
network to multiply quickly, it seems fitting that the antidote should use a similar 
strategy to spread to machines that need it. By allowing the latest prescriptions to 
be   propagated  to   subscribers  at   uninfected   sites,   it   is   possible  in   principle  to 
immunize the entire PC world against an emerging virus very rapidly.
Regardless of how sophisticated antivirus technology may become, computer 
viruses will forever remain in an uneasy coexistence with us and our computers. 
Individual   strains   will   wax   and   wane,   but   as   a   whole,   computer   viruses   and 
antivirus technology will coevolve much as biological parasites and hosts do. Both 
will also evolve in response to such changes in the computing environment as 
itinerant software agents--which will have to be protected from corruption by the 
computer systems they traverse even as those systems guard themselves from agent 
malice.   Perhaps   computer   viruses   and   computer   immune   systems   are   merely 
precursors of an eventual rich ecosystem of artificial life-forms that will live, die, 
cooperate and prey on one another in cyberspace.
