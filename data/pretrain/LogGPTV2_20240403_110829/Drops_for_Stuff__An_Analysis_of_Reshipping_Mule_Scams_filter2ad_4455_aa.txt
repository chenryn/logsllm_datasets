ABSTRACT

Introduction
Credit card fraud has seen rampant increase in the past years, as
customers use credit cards and similar ﬁnancial instruments frequently.
Both online and brick-and-mortar outﬁts repeatedly fall victim to
cybercriminals who siphon off credit card information in bulk. Despite
the many and creative ways that attackers use to steal and trade credit
card information, the stolen information can rarely be used to withdraw
money directly, due to protection mechanisms such as PINs and
cash advance limits. As such, cybercriminals have had to devise more
advanced monetization schemes to work around the current restrictions.
One monetization scheme that has been steadily gaining traction are
reshipping scams. In such scams, cybercriminals purchase high-value
or highly-demanded products from online merchants using stolen
payment instruments, and then ship the items to a credulous citizen.
This person, who has been recruited by the scammer under the guise of
“work-from-home” opportunities, then forwards the received products
to the cybercriminals, most of whom are located overseas. Once the
goods reach the cybercriminals, they are then resold on the black
market for an illicit proﬁt. Due to the intricacies of this kind of scam,
it is exceedingly difﬁcult to trace, stop, and return shipments, which is
why reshipping scams have become a common means for miscreants
to turn stolen credit cards into cash.
In this paper, we report on the ﬁrst large-scale analysis of reshipping
scams, based on information that we obtained from multiple reshipping
scam websites. We provide insights into the underground economy
behind reshipping scams, such as the relationships among the various
actors involved, the market size of this kind of scam, and the associated
operational churn. We ﬁnd that there exist proliﬁc reshipping scam
operations, with one having shipped nearly 6,000 packages in just
9 months of operation, exceeding 7.3 million US dollars in yearly
revenue, contributing to an overall reshipping scam revenue of an
estimated 1.8 billion US dollars per year. Finally, we propose possible
approaches to intervene and disrupt reshipping scam services.

Due to their convenience, online banking and electronic commerce
have grown signiﬁcantly in the past years. With just a credit card and
Internet access, one can buy a wide variety of goods and have them
shipped to their residence, without the need of an in-person transaction.
At the same time, however, cybercriminals covet users’ ﬁnancial
account information to proﬁt off of them. Data breaches, phishing, and
fraud continue to rise and affect millions of users each year. In 2012,
the software company Adobe Systems was breached and information
of nearly 152 million customers was stolen [1]. In late 2013, in a
data breach against Target (the second largest discount retailer in the
United States), attackers gained access to the credit card and personal
information of up to 110 million customers [2]. In the very same spirit,
in September 2014, the hardware store Home Depot discovered that
their point-of-sale systems were infected with custom-built malware to
exﬁltrate credit card information, resulting in 56 million stolen credit
cards from this incident alone [3]. Next to these high-proﬁle cases,
hundreds of smaller regional companies are breached, what appears
to be, almost monthly.
In addition to online breaches of companies storing ﬁnancial data,
cybercriminals are now branching into the physical world by targeting
the makers of Point-of-Sale (PoS) terminals and infecting them with
malware, leading to the exﬁltration of credit card data each time a cus-
tomer swipes his credit card. For instance, in April 2015, Harbortouch,
a PoS manufacturer, was attacked by cybercriminals who planted mal-
ware on their terminals which were then distributed to more than 4,200
businesses [4]. Finally, information stealing botnets and malware,
such as Zeus or Torpig, remain important tools in the cybercriminal’s
arsenal to steal credit card information and account credentials [5].
Despite the criminals’ seemingly inexhaustible stream of compro-
mised credit card information, information theft is usually just the
ﬁrst stepping stone of a long series of transactions in the underground
economy. More speciﬁcally, monetization of obtained credit card in-
formation is a difﬁcult challenge that the cybercriminals face. Directly
withdrawing money using stolen credit cards is usually limited to small
amounts (the cash advance limit) and also bears the risk of exposing the
cybercriminals’ true identities and locations to law enforcement, credit
card companies, and banks. Since criminals want to maximize their
proﬁt and avoid prosecution, they had to devise more elaborate mon-
etization schemes. One class of particularly successful monetization
schemes are so-called reshipping scams.
In a reshipping scam, the criminals purchase high-value products
with stolen credit cards and recruit willing and unsuspecting people
(reshipping mules) to receive and forward the packages on behalf of
the criminals. Once the fraudsters receive the products, they then
sell them on the black market for cash and thus proﬁt at the cost of
consumers, merchants, banks, and insurance companies. In the past

tive and Resource Fusion Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
years, these reshipping scams have become one of the main approaches
for attackers to monetize stolen credit cards.
Reshipping scams offer a variety of advantages to cybercriminals.
First, domestic reshipping mules allow the criminals to sneak mer-
chandise to countries that are not legitimate shipping destinations for
a given product. Second, as the unwitting mules serve as relaying
intermediaries who cloak the criminals’ true identities, these schemes
act as an additional level of indirection and obfuscate traces that the
criminals might have left behind otherwise. Besides the advantages
for criminals, reshipping scams can result in dire consequences for the
mules. As an accomplice to fraud, the mules often end up with ﬁnancial
loss, sometimes suffer personal harm (PTSD, depression), and even
enter the crosshair of both local and federal law enforcement [6, 7].
Disrupting the reshipping chains of these scams has the potential to
cripple the underground economy by affecting a major income stream
of cybercriminals. In this paper, we investigate the cornerstones of
reshipping scams and identify vantage points to cause such disrup-
tion. Additionally, we present the ﬁrst in-depth, large-scale study of
reshipping scam operations. To characterize the operational logistics
of reshipping scams and the relationships between the key actors, we
analyze detailed log ﬁles from seven reshipping scams.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• We present the ﬁrst in-depth, large-scale analysis of the operational
logistics behind reshipping scams, based on log data collected from
seven reshipping scams.
• We identify the key components in reshipping scams and provide
insights about their operations, including volume of packages, esti-
mated revenue, volume and churn of mules, and targeted merchants.
• We identify bottlenecks in the analyzed reshipping scams and
propose intervention techniques that can be applied to attack and
disrupt the reshipping chain. Such interference can reduce the
criminals’ proﬁt, disincentivize reshipping scams as a monetization
technique, and, in turn, prevent further unsuspecting users from
falling victim to these scams.
2 Reshipping Scams
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the background and terminology
used in reshipping scams, and then provide a detailed description of
how criminals operate and manage such operations.
2.1 Terminology
In the reshipping scam ecosystem, criminals take on different roles
depending on their involvement. Similarly, multiple victims are af-
fected every time a single package is bought and shipped. We introduce
the terminology (slang) used by the underground players and we deﬁne
the individual roles of the entities involved in the scam.
Operator. The operator of a reshipping scam sets up and manages
the reshipping scam’s website, which is the central component of
the entire operation, tying the various actors together. The website
is typically well-designed and resembles sites of legitimate package
handling and inventory companies to trick the mules into believing
that the scam is indeed a legitimate operation. The responsibilities
of the operator, however, do not end here: on a regular basis, he
has to recruit mules who are willing to ship packages on behalf of
a third party (i.e., the stuffers, see below). To this end, the operators
resort to social engineering and promise the mules a commission or
even a monthly salary for their work. Later on in the scam, once the
operator recruited an initial set of mules, he “rents” out the recruited
mules to other criminals who buy goods with stolen credit cards
and pay the operator for what is effectively reshipping as a service.
Stuffer. The cybercriminals who rent mules from the reshipping scam
sites’ operators to move merchandise are referred to as stuffers.
They purchase high-value products with stolen credit cards from
merchants and have the merchants ship the items to the mules’
addresses. Once the mules receive the packages, the stuffers
provide them with prepaid shipping labels that the mules will use
to ship the packages to the stuffers themselves. After they received
the packages relayed by the mules, the stuffers sell the products
on the black market (usually for cash) to make an illicit proﬁt.
Drop. In underground forums, criminals refer to reshipping mules
also as drops, a term derived from requests for mules which are
often titled “drops for stuff.” Most drops are people who are looking
for a part-time or work-from-home job, but who are then deceived
by the scam operators who pose as legitimate shipping compa-
nies [8]. Drops are the main labor force of the scam: their job is to
receive packages for the stuffers, verify, photograph, repackage the
contents, attach new shipping labels, and ship the packages to the
stuffer (usually located in foreign countries). While they are often
promised a commission per package or sometimes even a monthly
salary by the scam operator, we discovered that drops are usually
not paid, and, instead, they are abandoned by the operators after a
short time (see Section 5.3). In this paper, we use the terms “drops”
and “mules” interchangeably.
Cardholder. Next, there are cardholders, which is the term that the
scam operators and stuffers use to refer to the owners of the stolen
credit cards. Cardholders are one of the many groups of victims of
the scam (alongside merchants, banks, insurers, and drops), because
their credit cards are being used fraudulently by the criminals.
Merchant. Lastly, merchants are legitimate businesses, such as Veri-
zon, Apple, or Amazon, who sell goods to the stuffers, not knowing
that the credit card used to purchase the goods has been compro-
mised. If they fail to identify the credit card as stolen in a timely
manner, they ship the merchandise to the drop, and, in turn, often
incur a signiﬁcant loss through this scam. The loss is due to being
robbed of the items, having paid for shipping, and having to return
the funds to the cardholder (chargeback).
In the remainder of this paper, we adopt these terms to provide a
holistic view of the underground economy of reshipping scams. In the
following section, we describe in more detail how the different entities
interact with each other and how the criminals operate the scam to
realize an illicit proﬁt by abusing and exploiting the cardholders, drops,
and merchants.
2.2 Anatomy of a Scam Operation
All reshipping scams that we studied in this paper operate in the
same way: reshipping as a service. A paid service that the stuffers
subscribe to and pay for “on demand.” The operators are paid for
providing access to regularly-changing drops and charge a ﬂat fee per
shipment, or a percentage fee based on the value of the items shipped.
Figure 1 provides a slightly simpliﬁed view on how such a reshipping
scam operates, and how the different entities interact with each other.
First, the operator posts enticing but fake high-paying job advertise-
ments, for work-at-home or part-time positions to various job portals,
such as Craigslist (omitted from the ﬁgure). To apply for the job, appli-
cants have to upload sensitive and personally-identiﬁable information,
such as copies of their passport, their driver’s license, or employment
records, to the scammer’s website (). Unknowingly, the applicant
fell victim to the scam, even if they do not ship a single item. That is,
besides becoming “drops for stuff,” the victims provide sufﬁcient in-
formation to become easy targets for identity theft where the scammers
have access to all the necessary information to open bank accounts or
credit cards in the victims’ names. Once the scammers review the sub-
mitted application and documents, the applicant will be added to the list
of drops. Note that drops are not necessarily made available to stuffers
immediately. Instead, the operators might keep them unavailable in the
Figure 1: Operational steps of a standard reshipping scam. First, a drop applies for part-time job as a reshipper on a reshipping scam website
(). Next, a stuffer obtains stolen credit cards (), e.g., through a data breach at a credit card processor or by buying them through an underground
forum. To monetize these stolen credit cards, the stuffer signs up with the reshipping scam site to get access to drops (). The stuffer then purchases
goods online, e.g., a computer, (), which the merchant ships to the drop (). The stuffer then provides a shipping label to the drop through
the reshipping scam site () that the drop uses to ship the goods to the stuffer ().
beginning to i) ensure a constant stream of drops later on, ii) to provide
backup and exclusive drops for a premium, and iii) to strengthen their
own reputation by advertising the size and provisions of their service.
Once the operators have recruited an initial set of drops to start their
operation, they advertise their services on various underground forums.
In the next step, a stuffer gains access to credit card information,
possibly by breaching a credit card processor directly, or by buying the
information on an underground forum () [9]. For the purpose of this
scam, it does not matter how the stuffer gains access to stolen credit
cards. Without loss of generality and to simplify this example and Fig-
ure 1, we assume that the breach happens after the reshipping scam web-
site has been created. To monetize the stolen credit card information the
stuffer then subscribes to a reshipping scam site (). Stuffers can ﬁnd
such sites by a variety of means, such as advertisements of an operator
or by actively posting requests for “drops for stuff” to an underground
forum. Once a stuffer has subscribed to the reshipping service, he uses
the stolen credit cards to purchase high-value or highly-demanded
products (e.g., computers, cameras, lenses, or Apple products) from
legitimate online retailers, such as Verizon, Apple, or Amazon. Instead
of having the items shipped directly to himself, the stuffer requests
a drop through the reshipping scam site and uses the drop’s address
as the delivery address for the package. However, instead of using
the drop’s name as the recipient, the stuffer provides the cardholder’s
name as the addressee. This serves the purpose of circumventing fraud
detection systems employed at the cardholder’s credit card issuer ().
The stuffer then adds the order to the reshipping scam site, associates
it with the drop, and informs the mule that a package will be arriving,
addressed to the cardholder of the credit card used to buy the goods.
Next, the merchant will ship the goods to the drop (). Upon arrival
of the package, the mule is instructed to open it and repackage it. For
some reshipping scam sites, the drop must also scan or take pictures
of the invoice (Figure 2(a)) and of the goods that he has received for
veriﬁcation. The main reason this step is enforced by some operators
is because they take a percentage commission based on the value of
the item that the stuffer shipped through their service (see Section 5.1).
Subsequently, the stuffer or operator, depending on how the site is
