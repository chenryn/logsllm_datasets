### Half a Sheep is Better Than None

The pleasure of reading Susan Hasler's "Project Halfsheep: or How the Agencyâ€™s Alien Got High" lies in its multi-layered narrative. The novel can be appreciated on several levels, each adding depth and complexity to the story.

**First Level: The Alien's Arrival**
The first level is a straightforward narrative about an alien from the planet Utorb who crash-lands on Earth shortly after World War II. The alien falls into the hands of the American military and the CIA, setting the stage for a series of events that explore the intersection of science fiction and historical intrigue.

**Second Level: A Window into CIA Culture**
The second level offers a satirical and ironic view of the CIA's early days, a time when the fear of Communism was at its peak and justified almost any action in the name of the "free world." This period saw the agency conducting experiments on unwitting subjects, often administering drugs to observe their effects. These experiments, though horrific, are made more bearable through the author's use of humor and the alien's unique perspective. Like viewing Medusa's head in a mirror, the reality is softened by the narrative's approach.

**Third Level: Biographical Themes**
The third level weaves together several themes that reflect the author's biography. As a long-time CIA veteran, Hasler has grappled with genuine enemies, the agency's culture, and the politics of careerism. Her humanity, values, and commitments, shaped by years within the agency, are evident in the choices made by the alien. The frustration and emotional toll of her experiences are channeled into this narrative, transforming personal struggles into literary art.

**Fiction as a Higher Purpose**
This book is not just a science fiction or spy novel; it serves a higher purpose. It translates the author's experiences and emotions into a compelling and enjoyable story. As one character in the book notes, popular spy novels are "so silly," but "Project Halfsheep" is deadly serious. The portraits of military and intelligence professionals, likely composites of real people, create a dark farce that is both bittersweet and, at times, deeply disturbing.

**Corporate Inhumanity and Internal Conflicts**
Anyone over thirty can relate to the inhumanity that corporate structures can impose, as individuals learn and internalize unwritten rules. Intelligence agencies, however, demand even more, with reinforcement coming from within and criticism from outside. This dynamic makes compliance with the agency's ethos more compelling and internal conflicts inevitable. The residual fury from these experiences shines through the narrative, much like white fire through the cracks of a stove.

**Constraints and Creative Outlets**
Working inside the CIA imposes severe constraints on what one can say and how one can say it. Even fiction is forbidden if it reveals classified information. For someone like Hasler, who is not used to being quiet, writing becomes a path to sanity. Literary works are more than just biography or therapy; they are a way to transform rage into a dramatic narrative that transcends the author's personal motives.

**Bypassing Taboos and Historical Context**
One way to bypass the taboo on revealing classified information is to wait until the details are no longer classified. This allows the author to address current issues without naming them, a common method of political satire. Set in the 1940s and 1950s, "Project Halfsheep" explores the errors made in pursuit of brainwashing techniques and the use of hallucinogens on unsuspecting subjects. These details were only revealed because financial documents were overlooked during the destruction of related records.

**Character Development and Empathy**
The story comes to life through characters with mixed motives, some of whom change as they interact with the alien. The female psychiatrist, Lee, develops a capacity for empathy, eventually claiming her biographical details as source material for her personality and career. Other characters, however, remain unchanged, treating the alien as a mere creature. The gradual revelation of the alien's humanity, and the reader's vicarious participation in this transformation, culminates in an epiphany. By the end, the reader feels more empathetic towards the alien than most of the humans, whose treatment of the "other" is dehumanizing.

**Current Relevance**
While there are moments of dark farce, the narrative as a whole is sobering. It invites readers to apply the lessons of the past to current events, such as the use of torture in the war against terror, persistent inequities in military and intelligence cultures, and the demonization of others to justify cruel treatment.

**Author's Analytical Skills**
Hasler's skills as an analyst, honed over years in the CIA, are evident in her ability to separate signals from noise, connect dots, and synthesize a coherent narrative. Her experience has also taught her the importance of forthrightness, especially in the face of pushback from colleagues, careerists, and politicians. This strength is reflected in the character of Lee, and readers may see glimpses of the author in the HBO documentary "In Search of Bin Laden."

**Conclusion**
"Project Halfsheep" is a vehicle for a serious exploration of behaviors and issues that are deeply personal to the author. After a lifetime in the "mines" of the CIA, these issues matter to her more than a little. Through her work, Hasler demonstrates the power of literature to transform personal experiences into a narrative that resonates with broader themes of humanity and justice.
