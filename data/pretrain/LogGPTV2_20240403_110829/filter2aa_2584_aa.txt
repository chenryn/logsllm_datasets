Half a Sheep is Better Than None 
A great deal of the pleasure of reading “Project Halfsheep: or How the Agency’s Alien 
Got High” by Susan Hasler comes from reading the novel on several levels.  
One level is the story of an alien from the planet Utorb who crash lands on earth and falls 
into the hands of the American military and the CIA shortly after World War 2.  
A second level is a view through a window of irony into the culture of the CIA in its 
green and cowboy days, when fear of Communists was at its highest and justified doing 
almost anything on behalf of the “free world.” That “anything” included experiments 
with unwitting and unsuspecting subjects, often administering drugs to the unwary, as the 
CIA did for example in houses of prostitution in San Francisco and New York, so the 
effects could be observed. Humor and the alien’s unique point of view ameliorates to a 
degree the more horrific effects of those experiments. Like looking at the head of Medusa 
in a mirror, reality is made bearable.  
A third level is the braiding of several themes which suggest some of the author’s 
biography, giving us a template of how a CIA veteran of many years of hand-to-hand 
combat with genuine enemies of the nation, the culture of the agency, men who were 
contemptuous and abusive of women, and the politics of careerism and expediency – how 
she managed to manage all that. The author’s humanity, values, and commitments, which 
must have evolved through years at the agency, permeate those threads and, I suggest, 
culminate in the choices made by the alien.  
The frustration that comes with that hand-to-hand combat takes a toll.  If consequences 
are unacknowledged, a person can wind up bent, but when the emotions are felt and 
“owned,” they can be channeled into narratives like this one, translated into literary 
artfulness, that is, that serves a higher purpose, and translated as well into an enjoyable 
story that masquerades as a science fiction/”spy novel” but is so much more. As one of 
the characters in the books says, it was not worth it to read popular spy novels because 
they are “so silly.” The author ought to know.  
This book is not silly. It is deadly serious but the portraits of military and intelligence 
professionals, composites one guesses of the middle-of-the-bell curve careerists the 
author met along the way, constitute a dark farce, a bittersweet comedy, although 
sometimes it is just plain awful, as we grasp what things were and are done, with deadly 
consequences.  
Any person over thirty can make a case for succumbing to the inhumanity into which 
they are assimilated by their corporate structure over time as they learn the unwritten but 
essential rules of the culture and disobey them to their detriment—whatever the culture, 
governmental, corporate, religious, academic, non-profit – they all require it to a degree. 
But perhaps the sixteen extant intelligence structures ask even more of a person because 
reinforcement is from within, while brickbats are thrown – often by those mired in 
2 
invincible ignorance – from the outside. That’s one reason the willingness of the director 
to “go to the mattresses” to defend a team that can not speak for itself is so important. 
That dynamic makes compliance with the ethos of the agencies even more compelling. It 
also makes internal conflicts inevitable. The emotions shelved during a long career do not 
go away, and in “Project Halfsheep” as in Hasler’s “Intelligence,” the residual fury glows 
through the narrative like white fire through the chinks of a stove.  
When one works “inside” – when one works for the CIA – what one can say “outside” 
and how one can say it is highly constrained. Even fiction is forbidden as an outlet if 
classified information, however disguised, is revealed. The lead character in “Three Days 
of the Condor,” a CIA operative, read fiction, after all, to learn what was real. That 
narrows the choices for a person unused to being quiet (e.g. Susan Hasler, these novels 
constituting the proof of my assertion), and who choose as a path to sanity the alchemy of 
fiction. Literary works are more than biography or therapy – such a reductionist approach 
leaves out the essence and value of the work – but it’s impossible to read Project 
Halfsheep without picking up on the themes as biographically significant. Those themes 
are woven into a skein which refuses to sacrifice the “white hot rage” as I called it in a 
review of “Intelligence” which is transformed into a dramatic narrative that transcends 
whatever motives triggered the author’s literary career.    
In addition, one way to bypass that taboo on revealing classified information is to wait 
until the details are long past and/or no longer classified (duh), when it is safe to tell the 
story.  Then the story can be used to speak to current issues without naming them, a 
standard method of political satire. This story, set in the 1940s and 1950s, is about the 
errors made, once upon a time, in pursuit of techniques of brainwashing and the value of 
using hallucinogens on unsuspecting subjects. Details of those projects were leaked into 
the public domain only because financial documents were overlooked when the Director 
ordered all documents related to them destroyed. So history piggybacks on fiction for 
those unwilling to research historical details.  
But Project Halfsheep does more than that. The story is dramatic because it comes to life 
through characters with mixed motives some of whom change as they engage with the 
alien over time. A capacity for growing empathy is conveyed by the female psychiatrist 
Lee, culminating in claiming her own biographical details as source materials for her 
personality and career. But some of the people to whom the alien is delivered change 
little or not all. They treat the alien as a creature, a thing, with no “humanity” (so to 
speak). The progressive revelation of the Halfsheep’s humanity, enabling the reader to 
participate vicariously in the transformation of the hapless prisoner from cultural and 
biological anomaly to a friend who acts on behalf of another at a critical moment, 
culminates in an epiphany: one feels at the end more sympathetic, more empathetic, to 
the Halfsheep (read the book to see why and how the alien gains its various names, which 
are pretty funny) than to most of the humans, whose treatment of the “other,” symbolized 
by the alien, is dehumanizing of both. The “other” is not just the captive creature, 
however, whose otherness is obvious as a benchmark but women above all who are 
abused by men, “enemies” dehumanized so they can be tortured,  “direct reports” who in 
a hierarchical military culture are treated as less than human by superiors – just about 
3 
every relationship in the book is characterized by abuse and over time the abused 
discover ways to set boundaries (often at significant cost to themselves) and the abusers 
respond in various ways to the autonomy, initiative and boldness of people who are mad 
as hell and just won’t take it any more. 
All that is in “Project Halfsheep.” So while there are laugh-out-loud moments of dark 
farce, the narrative as a whole is sobering.  It invites the reader to apply the details of the 
bygone period in which the narrative takes place to current events: the use of torture in 
the war against terror (I don’t mean water boarding, I mean torture, the kind that results 
in what interrogators call an “oops death”), persistent inequities in military cultures and 
the intelligence “community,” and the demonization of others to justify savage treatment 
when they won’t do as they are told. 
So yes, laughs punctuate the tension, but the book as a whole isn’t funny. It’s a vehicle 
for a serious rendition of behaviors and issues that obviously are more than academic to 
the author. After a lifetime in the “mines” of the CIA, these issues clearly matter to her 
more than a little. 
Hasler obviously has the skills of an analyst – separating signals from noise, connecting 
dots, synthesizing and articulating a narrative that is not projected or imposed on the data 
but emerges from the data points themselves. Years in “the mines” have also honed the 
skill of arguing her position against inevitable pushback from well-meaning colleagues, 
careerists with other agendas, men who just don’t like women in positions of 
responsibility, and politicians who distort and abuse the end product of analysis for their 
own purposes. That experience strengthens and stiffens one’s backbone, because one 
learns that nothing but forthrightness works – not deference, or laughing and touching a 
man’s arm coquettishly, or silence that signifies assent – nothing. This shows up above 
all in the psychiatrist Lee, but maybe the reader can glimpse a little of the author in her 
role as analyst in the HBO documentary, “In Search of Bin Laden,” which illuminates the 
context of some of her counter-intelligence work after 9/11.  
In addition, over a long career, Hasler had the intelligence, imagination and empathy to 
write speeches for three CIA directors. That requires a grasp of the real essence of the 
other, personality as well as positions, and that goes beyond left-brain analysis. (I once
