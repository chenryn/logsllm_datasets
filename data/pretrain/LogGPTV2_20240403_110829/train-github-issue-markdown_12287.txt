### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
The `orientation` prop for the `StepButton` component should be optional, as described in the documentation.

#### Current Behavior
Currently, the `orientation` prop is required, which causes a type mismatch error.

#### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Attempt to use the `StepButton` component without providing the `orientation` prop.
2. The following TypeScript error occurs:

   ```
   ERROR in /xxx/xx.tsx
   [tsl] ERROR in /xxx/xx.tsx(240,29)
   TS2322: Type '{ children: string[]; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & StepButtonProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'.
   Type '{ children: string[]; }' is not assignable to type 'StepButtonProps'.
   Property 'orientation' is missing in type '{ children: string[]; }'.
   ```

#### Context
This issue affects the usability of the `StepButton` component, as it requires an additional prop that is supposed to be optional according to the documentation.
