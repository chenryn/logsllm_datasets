Question: "In the context of the Android Fingerprint HIDL, suppose an alternative design was proposed where the raw fingerprint data and derivatives are processed outside the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and then sent back to the TEE for final verification. What would be the potential drawbacks of this design change?"
 "A": "This approach could enhance the performance of fingerprint matching due to reduced processing within the TEE."
 "B": "It would increase the risk of fingerprint data being intercepted or tampered with, as it would be processed in a less secure environment."
 "C": "The change could simplify the development of vendor-specific libraries by reducing dependency on the TEE."
 "D": "It would allow for a more flexible SELinux policy configuration since the data would be processed outside of the TEE."
Answer: B
