The next menu prompts for changing the filename of the PDF file; the default name
is moo.pdf, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 178 ]
Chapter 7
The default name will not likely entice a potential victim to open the file;
furthermore, it may be identified by client-side security. For these reasons,
the filename should be changed. The name should reflect the intended audience
being attacked. For example, if you are targeting the finance group, give the PDF
file a title such as Tax Law Amendments.
You will now be offered the option of either attacking a single e-mail address, or
mass-mailing (for example, an employee list of the target company, or a specific
group within the company). Option 1 was selected for this example.
SEToolkit will then prompt to use a predefined template or craft a one-time e-mail
template. If you select a predefined template, the following options will be available:
An effective social engineering attack is crafted for the target; therefore, select option
2, One-Time Use Email Template, to create a one-time use e-mail template, as
shown in the following screenshot:
[ 179 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
You will be offered the option of using your own Gmail account to launch the attack
(1) or use your own server or open relay(2). If you use a Gmail account, it is likely
that the attack will fail, and you will receive the following message:
[!] Unable to deliver email. Printing exceptions message
below, this is most likely due to an illegal attachment. If using GMAIL
they inspect PDFs and it is most likely getting caught.
Gmail inspects outgoing emails for malicious files, and is very effective at identifying
payloads produced by SEToolkit and the Metasploit Framework. If you have to send
a payload using GMail, use Veil-Evasion to encode it first.
It is recommended that you use the sendmail option to send executable files;
furthermore, it allows you to spoof the source of the e-mail to make it appear as
though it originated from a trusted source.
The target will receive the following e-mail message:
To ensure that an e-mail is effective, the attacker should take care of the
following points:
• The content should provide a "carrot" (the new server will be faster, have
improved anti-virus) and a "stick" (changes you will have to make before you
can access your e-mail). Most people respond to immediate calls for action,
particularly when affects them.
• In the sample given previously, the attached document is titled template.doc.
In a real-world scenario, this would be changed to Email instructions.doc.
• Ensure that your spelling and grammar are correct, and the tone of the
message matches the content.
[ 180 ]
Chapter 7
• The title of the individual sending the e-mail should match the content.
If the target organization is small, you may have to spoof the name of a
real individual and send the e-mail to a small group that does not normally
interact with that person.
• Include a phone number—it makes the e-mail look more "official", and there
are various ways to use commercial voice over IP solutions to obtain a short-
term phone number with a local area code.
Once the attack e-mail is sent to the target, successful activation (the recipient
launches the executable) will create a reverse Meterpreter tunnel to the attacker's
system. The attacker will then employ Meterpreter and other tools to conduct typical
post-exploitation activities.
Using a website attack vector – Java Applet
Attack Method
The Java Applet Attack Method uses an infected Java applet to load a malicious
application onto the target system. This attack is favored by many attackers
because it is highly reliable, and it is effective against Windows, Linux, and
Mac OS X systems.
To launch the attack, open SEToolkit and select option 2) Website Attack
Vectors, from the main menu. Then select option 1) Java Applet Attack Method,
to launch the initial menu, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 181 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
The options for web template are Java Required, Gmail, Google, Facebook,
Twitter, and Yahoo. The Java Required page, as shown in the following screenshot,
is usually effective because it directly prompts the user to update a vital piece of
software before continuing.
You can also choose to clone an existing site, such as the target's corporate website.
After making the selection, the attacker is then prompted to determine if they use
Port/NAT forwarding and provide the IP address of the attacking machine for the
reverse connection, as shown in the following screenshot:
Word wrapping is not well handled by the SEToolkit, and it is
common that a typed response will wrap back and overwrite a
part of the command line.
[ 182 ]
Chapter 7
After providing the required URL, SEToolkit will start the site cloning process,
as shown in the following screenshot. When completed, the application will start
generating the payload and supporting files (the .jar archive and the cloned
index.html file).
The next stage includes the selection of the payload. If stealth is especially important,
use option 17 to select an executable that has been encoded using veil, as shown in
the following screenshot:
[ 183 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
Select the encoding option to bypass local anti-virus on the target system; the most
effective of them is the fourth option, Backdoored Executable, as shown in the
following screenshot:.
The application will prompt for the listening port, and then start generating code for
common ports (25, 53, 80, 443, and so on) on the victim's machine, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Now comes the social engineering step—the attacker has to convince the targeted
person to connect to the IP address of the listening system. If the target enters that
system, they will be directed to the cloned site hosted on the listener.
[ 184 ]
Chapter 7
The site will present the targeted person with a security warning, as shown in the
following screenshot, indicating that an application needs to be executed in order to
access the site.
If the person chooses to execute the application, a reverse shell (depending
on the selected payload) will be formed between their computer and the
attacker's computer.
The two attacks presented demonstrate the different approaches used by the
SEToolkit to gain control of a target's computer using a reverse shell or a similar
payload. An attacker can extend the control in a number of ways, such as using
a VNC payload or placing a RATTE.
However, these attacks are intrusive—it is possible that the reverse shell may
trigger an egress alarm at the firewall as it connects to the attacker's machine.
More importantly, the payload may be reverse engineered to identify information
about the attacker.
Finally, the goal of the attack may not be an immediate compromise; instead, the
attacker may wish to collect user credentials to support a later attack, or to reuse
the credentials at multiple places on the Internet. So, let's examine a credential
harvesting attack.
[ 185 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
Using a website attack vector – Credential
Harvester Attack Method
Credentials, generally the username and password, give a person access to networks,
computing systems, and data. An attacker can use this information indirectly (by
logging on to the victim's Gmail account and sending e-mails to facilitate an attack
against the victim's trusted connections), or directly against the user's account.
This attack is particularly relevant given the extensive reuse of credentials—users
typically reuse passwords in multiple places.
Particularly prized are the credentials of a person with privileged access, such as a
system administrator or a database administrator, which can give an attacker access
to multiple accounts and data repositories.
The SEToolkit's credential harvesting attack uses a cloned site to collect credentials.
To launch this attack, select Website Attack Vectors from the main menu, and
then select Credential Harvester Attack Method. For this example, we will
follow the menu selections to clone a website, such as Facebook.
Again, the target IP address must be sent to the intended target. When the target
clicks on the link or enters the IP address, they will be presented with a cloned page
that resembles the regular entry page for Facebook, and they will be prompted to
enter their usernames and passwords.
Once this is done, the users will be redirected to the regular Facebook site, where
they will be logged in to their account.
In the background, their access credentials will be collected and forwarded to the
attacker. They will see the following entry in the listener window:
[ 186 ]
Chapter 7
When the attacker has finished collecting credentials, entering CTRL + C will
generate two reports in the /SET/reports directory in the XML and HTML formats.
A similar attack option is the Web Jacking Attack. When the victims open the
attacker's link, they will be presented with a page informing them that their selected
page has been moved, as shown in the following screenshot:
When the users click on the link to go to the new location, they will be presented
with a cloned page that appears to be the one expected, as shown in the following
screenshot; again, the page will be harvesting their login credentials.
Note that the address in the URL bar is not the valid address for
Google; most users will recognize that something is wrong if they can
see the address. A successful exploit requires the attacker to prepare
the victim with a suitable pretext, or story, to make the victim accept
the unusual URL. For example, send an e-mail to a targeted group of
nontechnical managers to announce that a "local Google mail site is
now being hosted by IT to reduce delays in the mail system."
[ 187 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
The Credential harvesting attack is an excellent tool for assessing the security of a
corporate network. To be effective, the organization must first train all employees
on how to recognize and respond to a phishing attack. Approximately two weeks
later, send a corporate-wide e-mail that contains some obvious mistakes (incorrect
name of the corporate CEO or an address block that contains the wrong address)
and a link to a program that harvests credentials. Calculate the percentage of
recipients who responded with their credentials, and then tailor the training
program to reduce this percentage.
Using a website attack vector – Tabnabbing
Attack Method
Tabnabbing exploits a user's trust by loading a fake page in one of the open tabs of a
browser. By impersonating a page of a site such as Gmail, Facebook, or any other site
that posts data (usually usernames and passwords), a tabnabbing attack can collect a
victim's credentials. The Social Engineering Toolkit invokes the credential harvester
attack that we previously described.
To launch this attack, launch the Social Engineering Toolkit from a console prompt,
and then select 1) Social-Engineering Attacks. In the next menu, select 2)
Website Attack Vectors. The tabnabbing attack is launched by selecting 4)
Tabnabbing Attack Method.
When the attack is launched, you will be prompted with three options to generate the
fake websites that will be used to gather credentials. The attacker can allow setoolkit
to import a list of predefined web applications, clone a website (such as Gmail), or
import their own website. For this example, we will select 2) Site Cloner.
This will prompt the attacker to enter the IP address that the server will POST to; this
is usually the IP address of the attacker's system. The attacker will then be prompted
to enter the URL of the website to be cloned. In the following screenshot, Gmail's
website has been selected.
The attacker must then employ social engineering to force the victim to visit the
IP address for the post back action (for example, URL shortening). The victim will
receive a message that the site is loading (as the attack script loads the cloned site
under a different tab in the browser, as shown in the following screenshot):
[ 188 ]
Chapter 7
The target will then be presented with the fake page (with the false IP address still
visible). If the users enter their usernames and passwords, the data will be posted to
the listener on the attacker's system. As you can see in the following screenshot, it
has captured the username and the password.
[ 189 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
Using a website attack vector - Multi-Attack
Web Method
The "hail Mary" attack for website attack vectors is Multi-Attack Web Method,
which allows the attacker to implement several different attacks at one time, should
they choose to. By default, all attacks are disabled, and the attacker chooses the ones
to run against the victim, as shown in the following screenshot:
This is an effective option if you are unsure which attacks will be effective against a
target organization; select one employee, determine the successful attack(s), and then
reuse these against the other employees.
Using the PowerShell alphanumeric
shellcode injection attack
The Social Engineering Toolkit also incorporates the more effective attacks based on
PowerShell, which is available on all Microsoft operating systems after the release of
Microsoft Vista. Because PowerShell shellcode can easily be injected into the target's
physical memory, attacks using this vector do not trigger anti-virus alarms.
To launch a PowerShell injection attack using setoolkit, select 1) Social-
Engineering Attacks from the main menu. Then select 10) Powershell Attack
Vectors from the next menu.
[ 190 ]
Chapter 7
This will give the attacker four options for attack types; for this example, select 1 to
invoke PowerShell Alphanumeric Shellcode Injector.
This will set the attack parameters and prompt the attacker to enter the IP address for
the payload listener, which will usually be the IP address of the attacker. When this
has been entered, the program will create the exploit code and start a local listener.
The PowerShell shellcode that launches the attack is stored at /root/.set/reports/
powershell/x86_powershell_injection.txt.
The social engineering aspect of the attack occurs when the attacker convinces the
intended victim to copy the contents of x86_powershell_injection.txt on a
command prompt, as shown in the following screenshot, and executes the code.
As shown in the following screenshot, execution of the shellcode did not trigger
an anti-virus alarm on the target system. Instead, when the code was executed, it
opened a meterpreter session on the attacking system and allowed the attacker to
gain an interactive shell with the remote system.
[ 191 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
Hiding executables and obfuscating the
attacker's URL
As shown in the previous examples, there are two keys to success in launching a
social engineering attack. The first is to obtain the information needed to make it
work—usernames, business information, and supporting details about networks,
systems, and applications.
However, the majority of the work effort is focused on the second aspect—crafting
the attack to entice the target into opening an executable or clicking on a link.
Several attacks produce modules that require the victim to execute them in order for
the attack to succeed. Unfortunately, users are increasingly wary about executing
unknown software. However, there are some ways to increase the possibility of
successful execution of the attack, including the following:
• Attack from a system that is known and trusted by the intended victim, or
spoof the source of the attack. If the attack appears to originate from the
help desk or IT support, and claims to be an "urgent software update", it will
likely be executed.
• Rename the executable to resemble trusted software, such as "Java Update".
• Embed the malicious payload into a benign file such as a PDF file using
an attack such as Metasploit's adobe_pdf_embedded_exe_nojs attack.
Executables can also be bound to Microsoft Office files, MSI install files, or
BAT files configured to run silently on the desktop.
• Have the user click on a link that downloads the malicious executable.
Since the SEToolkit uses the attacker's URL as the destination for its attacks, a key
success factor is to ensure that the attacker's URL is believable to the victim. There
are several techniques to accomplish this, including the following:
• Shorten the URL using a service such as goo.gl or tinyurl.com. The
shortened URLs are common among social media such as Twitter, and
victims rarely use precautions when clicking on such links.
• Enter the link on a social media site such as Facebook or LinkedIn; the site
will create its own link to replace yours, with an image of the destination
page. Then, remove the link that you entered, leaving behind the new social
media link.
[ 192 ]
Chapter 7
• Create a fake web page on LinkedIn or Facebook—as the attacker, you
control the content, and can create a compelling story to drive members to
click on links or download executables. A well-executed page will not only
target employees, but also vendors, partners, and their clients, maximizing
the success of a social engineering attack.
• Embed the link in a file such as PowerPoint.
To embed a link in PowerPoint, launch it and create a slide show by saving the
extension as .pps. Give the presentation a title that will be of interest to the target
person, and create a couple of generic content files. On the front page, insert a text
box and drag the box to cover the entire surface of that slide. Click on Insert, and
then select the Action tab. In the dialog box, click on the Hyperlink to radio button,
and select URL from the drop-down menu. Enter the URL used to launch the attack,
as shown in the following screenshot:
When the file is opened, it starts as a fullscreen slide show. Because the attack is
launched via a mouse over, the users will launch the attack when they attempt to
close the document.
[ 193 ]
Physical Attacks and Social Engineering
Escalating an attack using DNS
redirection
If an attacker or penetration tester has compromised a host on the internal network,
they can escalate the attack using DNS redirection. This is generally considered to
be a horizontal attack (it compromises persons of roughly the same access
privileges); however, it can also escalate vertically if credentials from privileged
persons are captured.
In this example, we will use ettercap which acts as a sniffer, interceptor, and logger for
switched LANs. It facilitates man-in-the-middle attacks, but we will use it to launch a
DNS redirection attack to divert users to sites used for our social engineering attacks.
To start the attack, we must first modify the ettercap configuration file located
at /etc/ettercap/etter.dns to redirect queries to our hostile site. A sample
using Microsoft's site is found in the configuration file; replicate the same details
to direct the target site request to the malicious IP address, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Start ettercap in graphical mode by typing ettercap –G at a command prompt.
From the Sniff tab, select Unified sniffing from the drop-down menu, as shown in
the following screenshot:
[ 194 ]
Chapter 7
When prompted to select the network interface, select eth0 for the internal
network (as you can see, ettercap will also support wireless attacks when you
select a different interface). You should see that the tabbed menu change, giving
you more options.
From the Hosts tab, select Scan for hosts from the drop-down menu. It will
conduct a rapid scan, and then report that "x hosts added to the hosts list". From
the Hosts tab, select Hosts list to see a list of possible target systems, as shown in
the following screenshot:
