### Network Traffic Engineering and Stability

The stability of the weight setting, as determined using estimated traffic matrices, in the face of traffic changes is a significant benefit of this approach. This stability ensures that the network can maintain optimal performance even when traffic patterns fluctuate.

### Practical and Robust Solution

These results demonstrate that the proposed solution is not merely a theoretical possibility but provides a robust and stable solution to real-world traffic engineering problems. The solution is based on traffic matrices estimated from link data (such as SNMP link measurements) and is practical both in terms of computational load and robustness to typical variations found in real networks.

### Experimental Results

**Figure 6:**
- **(a) OSPF Optimization:** Shows the maximum utilization for the true traffic matrix over five days, using OSPF optimization weights.
- **(b) InvCap Weights:** Shows the same metric using InvCap weights. Both figures share the same y-axis scale.

### Reflections on Limitations

#### 7.1 Max-Utilization Objective
We chose the max-utilization objective for its simplicity and ease of understanding, rather than because it is the most important or best objective. Our results are promising, and we hope they will inspire further studies on other important traffic engineering objectives.

#### 7.2 Proprietary Scaling
For proprietary reasons, all max-utilization values have been scaled by a secret factor to hide the true values. While the absolute value is interesting (e.g., a common operational requirement is that max-utilization be below 60%), the relative improvement in max-utilization (e.g., from 100% to 57.7%) is significant. Even if the scaling factor were 2, the improvement from 50% to 28.8% would still be relevant, as it allows for more growth before additional equipment investment is needed.

#### 7.3 InvCap Benchmark
We used InvCap as a benchmark for several reasons:
- It is a vendor-recommended default, making it a natural starting point.
- Previous studies [7] found InvCap to be as good as or better than other simple heuristics.
- [12] showed that InvCap weights performed as well as optimized weights for an independently generated traffic matrix.

Improvements over InvCap indicate how much better our routing is compared to a clueless one. In practice, InvCap often achieves within a factor of 2 of optimality, which is better than some theoretically impressive but impractical methods like oblivious routing [24, 25].

#### 7.4 Data Sets
There are two major issues with the experimental data:
- The data are proprietary, making it difficult for other researchers to reproduce and build upon our results.
- All data come from the same network, limiting generalizability.

While public estimates of network topologies are available [26], obtaining accurate traffic matrices is challenging. Simple models for generating synthetic traffic matrices often fail to capture real-world complexities. Using a gravity-based model [28] for generating synthetic data can lead to overly optimistic results, as the estimation method is inherently biased towards the generation model.

### Conclusion

This paper aimed to provide a practical measure for assessing the accuracy of traffic matrix estimation. By testing the routing optimization based on estimated traffic matrices against the true traffic matrix, we found that the combination of tomogravity and OSPF weight optimization is a powerful and practical method for traffic engineering. The OSPF optimization method is robust to errors in traffic matrix estimates and can optimize weights for a range of traffic matrices, providing solutions that work well into the future.

### Future Work

We plan to explore alternative optimization methods and traffic matrix estimation algorithms. Given the quality of the results, we do not expect significant improvements in algorithms but hope to gain additional insights into the problem.
