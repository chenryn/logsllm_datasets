Figure 5), one can see that 65% or 44 of all passwords
entered with LastPass are stronger than the overall aver-
age of 2.20, while the other entry methods show a more
balanced distribution across the zxcvbn scores (except
for score 0). In summary, this indicates that LastPass
shows an improved password strength (mean of 2.80 with
SD=1.07) and password uniqueness in comparison to the
other entry methods. Copy&paste exhibits the strongest
password uniqueness, however, at the same time the weak-
est password strength (1.98 on average with a SD=1.33).

symptomatically reported: "I think of a word I want to use
and will remember like. mouse. I then decide to capitalize
a letter in it like mOuse. I then add a special character
to the word like mOuse@. I then decided a few numbers
to add like mOuse@84." Only a very small subgroup of
seven participants reported using analog tools to create
passwords, such as dice or books ("I have a book on my
desk I pick a random page number and I use the ﬁrst letter
of the ﬁrst ten words and put the page number at the end
and a period after."), or using passphrases.
Many of the participants in this group also hinted in
their answers to their password storage strategies. For
instance, various participants emphasized ease of remem-
bering as a criteria for new passwords (e.g., "something
easy to remember, replace some letters with numbers."),
others use analog or digital storage (e.g., "I try to remem-
ber something easy or I right[sic] it down on my computer
and copy&paste it when needed."). Many participants
also admitted re-using passwords as their strategy (e.g., "I
use the same password I always use because it has served
me well all these years" and "I have several go to words i
use and add numbers and symbols that i can remember").
4.3.1 Group demographics
We provide an overview of the groups’ demographics in
Appendix E. We again used a Mann-Whitney test to detect
any signiﬁcant differences in the distributions of those two
demographic groups. We ﬁnd that they have statistically
signiﬁcant different distribution for gender (U= 2,366,
p= .016), computer science background (U = 2,181,
p|z|)
