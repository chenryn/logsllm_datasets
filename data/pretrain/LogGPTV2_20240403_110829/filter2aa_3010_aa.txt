A COUP D'ETAT BY A GROUP OF MERCENARY HACKERS 
Paper by: C Rock and S Mann:  
Winston Churchill famously said - when the Germans were about to 
overrun France on one or other of their invasions - "Gentlemen, do 
not forget, this is not just about France ... this is about 
champagne."  
A 'Coup' in France can mean a glass of champagne. A blow. But that 
is not our subject. We mean Coup d'Etat, putsch, Assisted Regime 
Change. 
The Urban Dictionary: "Coup d'Etat 
Seizure of power by an armed entity, usually the army but 
sometimes the police. 
Usually coups are perpetrated in countries with very weak 
governments, such as in West Africa, Bolivia, or Southwest Asia. 
They get progressively worse (i.e., more violent, more prolonged, 
and more repressive) until eventually some junta builds up 
protection against the next coup. This is what happened in Iraq 
after 1979; it happened in Syria in 1973; it also happened in 
Japan in 1607. In other cases, the coup accomplishes its goals 
(Chile 1973) and retires as a PR move. 
Military coups are difficult to pull off and usually are nipped in 
the bud. Even with foreign assistance, they are hard, because they 
are a form of high-speed civil war.

So how does this paper define its subject matter, the Coup d'Etat? 
A blow - a knock out blow - against the existing government of a 
sovereign state. A blow that puts in place a new government. That 
blow is the work of a group within the existing state government. 
They are armed & powerful. This bunch, however, are modern. They 
are going to use hackers. 
Putsch? Another word for the same thing. Assisted Regime Change? 
Perhaps the same thing, but probably very different. Assisted 
Regime Change can be a euphemism for a Coup or Putsch, or it can 
be far more insidious. 
When a democracy votes it may result in a regime change. It's 
meant to. What if a super power carries out actions to influence 
an election that does bring down a regime? What if those actions 
were not overt? What if those actions were covert or clandestine? 
What if the good of the people is best served if there is the need 
for a regime change? What if those actions - albeit covert - were 
really in the interests of the people? Who says that's so? 
One man's Coup leader - a hero - is another's Superpower puppet. 
Traitor. 
New definition of COUP after working with the Cyber angle 
What if the Coup of this century does NOT follow our definition 
exactly … that was: 
A Coup d'Etat: a secretly prepared but overtly carried out illegal 
blow to unseat & replace the ruling executive government of a 
sovereign state, somehow executed by the military or other elite 
of that state's apparatus or their agents. 
What if (because change is the one constant etc) we say:  
A Coup d'Etat: a secretly prepared but overtly carried out illegal 
blow to somehow takeover the ruling executive government of a 
sovereign state, somehow executed by the military or other elite 
of that state's apparatus or their agents.  
It doesn’t have to be replaced. It has to be suborned. I guess 
that the best example of a suborned government is that of Petain, 
and Vichy France. 
Working Scenario Back Story and Mudmap 
1. Historically (19TH C onwards … the Great Game …) Russia has 
always wished to extend its power down into the sub-continent and 
- therefore - the Gulf. 
2. That was the cause of their long alliance with Iran … All the 
more so today … Putin / Turkey / Syria. 
3. Russia are now allies of Iran in the Syria Civil War … despite 
Iran now being an ally of the USA despite the long standing claims 
of Iraq that Kuwait has drilled into it’s reserves using 
horizontal drilling. 
4. Russia would love Basra. the port of Basra that the British 
always knew was the key card to the Gulf, but Russia can’t have 
Basra, so they hatch a plan - along with their friends in Tehran - 
to take Kuwait, the next best thing to Basra. 
5. BUT: Not to take Kuwait in the old fashioned sense … NO 
invasion … NO traditional Coup … instead they decide to take 
Kuwait by means of a creeping Coup that replaces the machinery of 
state - what an FSB / KGB Officer would call the apparat - with a 
cardre of infiltrated apparatchiks … a group who surround the 
throne so closely that in effect they tell the throne Do this … 
Don’t do that …  
6.  How to achieve this? The Russians know two things above all 
else: the people of Kuwait are still grateful to the US and allies 
for winning their country back from Saddam, and the deep and 
ancient friendship between the Royals of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait … 
through their common tribe as well as everything else. 
7. They also know that their is a friendship between the tribe of 
Kuwait and people of SW Iran. This is documented and crosses or 
transcends the Sunni / Shia rivalry. 
8. Meanwhile … What do the Saudi’s want more than anything else? 
To know the intent of the enemy commander. In this case that of 
the Ayatollah of Iran and those around him. This is the great 
Middle East war of our time: the Sunni Gulf versus the ancient 
might of Persia …  
9. So the Russians set up a fake agent … close to the Ayatollah’s 
etc … so that this agent becomes an asset of the Kuwait 
intelligence service … and the Saudi intelligence service love the 
Kuwaiti’s for this … it is all their dreams come true … 
10. While all this is going on IS have built up a serious chain of 
terrorist cells within Kuwait. Kuwait is 30% Shia. The IS cells 
are against them, even though they are also against the normal 
Sunnis as well … and to what extent are IS in fact Saudi backed? 
Big Q?? 
11. Suddenly a number of things happen. IS jump up in Kuwait fully 
active … and do so apparently fully backed by the Saudi’s. 
12. At the same time the Kuwaiti run agent close to the 
Ayatollah’s turns out to be a plant …  deliberately set up by 
Kuwait to mislead Riyadh … What? 
13. At the same time Iraq (with Baghdad controlled by Tehran, of 
course) presses it’s claims: horizontal drilling ! We want our oil 
back … or $B …  
14. Kuwait are now under attack. From Iraq about the oil. From IS 
about Allah. From the Saudi’s for fooling them so badly. AND SO … 
in this massive fall out Kuwait turn to their new found and ever 
willing strong friend: Russia … and Russia moves in …  
It is hacking and manipulation of IT data that is making ALL this 
happen … How? because so much of all this is in fact now IT based: 
information storage, intelligence analysis and management, social 
media, The News. You (us) already own the countries entire I.T 
systems, now its just a matter of pulling the right levers. 
Corruption, is perfect to bring down the government. Wasting the 
countries natural resources and all of that. 
MOCK PAPER WRITTEN BY THE RUSSIAN STAFF 
[in fact written by Chris Rock and Simon Mann 
1. Introductory Background 
In order to avoid being encircled by foreign powers and possible 
enemies Russia has long sought to establish herself as a Major 
Power in the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. 
This intent has all the more force when one considers the economic 
importance of the Gulf to our rivals, the USA and allies, as well 
as the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean. 
Iran has long been our ally and friend, most especially since the 
Coup of 1941 engineered by ourselves and the British, against the 
then interest of Nazi Germany. 
The Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran also known as Anglo-Soviet 
Invasion of Persia was the invasion of the Empire of Iran during 
World War II by Soviet, British and other Commonwealth armed 
forces. The invasion lasted from 25 August to 17 September 1941, 
and was codenamed Operation Countenance. The purpose was to secure 
Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines (see Persian 
Corridor) for the Soviets, fighting against Axis forces on the 
Eastern Front. Though Iran was officially neutral, according to 
the Allies its monarch Rezā Shāh was friendly toward the Axis 
powers and was deposed during the subsequent occupation and 
replaced with his young son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. 
Our efforts in Afghanistan, mounted from our then controlled 
state, Turkmenistan, were all a part of this longstanding Russian 
Grand Strategic desire. The British and then the USA have always 
fought against this aim of ours, a fight which validates our 
intent. They are afraid of a Russia that can exercise her power in 
the Arabian Gulf / Sub-continent of India / Indian Ocean theatre. 
Following the invasion of Iraq by the US and its allies in 2003 - 
and the subsequent events in the region - it has become all the 
more imperative that Russia takes the steps needed to defend 
herself. 
The ideal for Russia would be the control of Basra as a military 
and commercial port. Basra - as the British always knew - is vital 
to the control of the Arabian Gulf. That is why the British always 
tried to hold on to Basra. Since Basra is impossible without 
risking all out war with the USA the control of Kuwait and of the 
Straights of Hormuz will be enough. 
The latter is already achieved by our allies Iran. 
Therefore, this paper outlines a plan whereby Russia can take 
control of Kuwait, thus achieving a major step towards her Grand 
Strategy for the Middle East and Indian Ocean theatres of 
operations. 
2. The Aim 
Russia’s Aim is to capture and hold full control of the mechanisms 
of power of Kuwait. 
3. Plan: General Outline 
The plan is that over as many years as it takes Russia will 
befriend the rulers of Kuwait. This friendship will become 
stronger as other friends of Kuwait fall away. In the end Russia 
achieves her aim. Russia will be the only friend, and the only 
actual military ally when all else have failed. 
Russia will then control Kuwait. The Russian aim will have been
