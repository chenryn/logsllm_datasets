**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote Data Staging

Adversaries may stage data collected from multiple systems in a central location or directory on a single system prior to exfiltration. This staging process can involve storing the data in separate files or consolidating it into a single file, often using techniques such as **Archive Collected Data** (T1560). Interactive command shells, along with common utilities like `cmd` and `bash`, may be employed to copy the data to the staging location. This centralized approach facilitates more efficient and organized exfiltration of the gathered information.
