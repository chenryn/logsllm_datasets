truth constructed in [25] was at a postcode level, while Cheng
et. al [19] did not actually verify their home selection with
some form of ground truth. Similarly, in [20] the authors
constructed a ground truth using 25x25km cells and stated
that “manual inspection shows that this infers home locations
with 85% accuracy” but did not include more details on how
that was done. Furthermore, the datasets in [39], [34], [43]
all contained only home locations, with the dataset by Lin
et al. [43] being based solely on the visual inspection of the
GPS data points. While in [34] the authors also relied on
manual inspection of tweet content for identifying the home
locations, that process was conducted by Amazon Mechanical
Turk workers who were only shown a subset of ﬁve tweets
from a cluster, whereas our manual inspection was conducted
collectively on the entirety of tweets assigned to each cluster.
Location and de-anonymization. The problem of identify-
ing key locations has also been explored in different settings,
e.g., using continuous GPS data collected from receivers in
cars [39] or wearables [41]. Golle and Partridge built upon
these ﬁndings and explored how users can be identiﬁed from
13
different granularities of anonymized census data [30]. De
Montjoye et al. [24] explored the uniqueness of user mobility
patterns in a 15-month dataset for 1.5M people, and found
that four coarse-grained spatiotemporal points can uniquely
differentiate 95% of the users in the set. Previously, Chong et
al. [67] reported a 93% predictability in mobility by measuring
the entropy of users’ trajectories. Rossi et al. [62] demonstrated
the feasibility of identifying users within mobility traces by
using movement data including speed, direction and distance
of travel and found that as little as two location points may be
sufﬁcient to uniquely identify users. Zang et al. [72] leveraged
an anonymized three-month dataset of mobile call records and
discovered that as few as the top-2 most frequented locations
(even at coarse granularities) can re-identify a user.
User behavior. Prior work also explored how users interact
with or disclose location data, and the feasibility of social-tie
inference. Liccardi et al. [42] explored how different ways
of visualizing data affected users in inferring the type of a
location (home, work, etc). Ahern et al. [13] investigated how
users select the privacy settings for uploaded photos, and found
that users are more likely to set as private photos that are
taken at frequently photographed locations while tending to
set photos from less frequented locations public. Consolvo
et al. [22] found that users were willing to disclose exact
locations, but that study focused on a different setting where
users were asked about sharing information with friends,
family and colleagues. Tang et al. [68] identiﬁed how users
adapt their location sharing behavior and explored the different
ways and levels of granularity at which users decide to share
their location under different hypothetical scenarios. Cheng et
al. [19] conducted a large-scale study of location data and
studied mobility patterns and the correlation between check-
ins and message content and sentiment. Sadilek et al. [64]
proposed a probabilistic human mobility model for predicting
users’ social links and locations. That model considers users
who disclose GPS coordinates as noisy sensors for inferring
the location of their friends. Several other works (e.g., [23],
[52], [65], [73]) leverage spatiotemporal data for inferring
social ties. Recently Backes et al. [15] developed an attack for
inferring social relationships from mobility data, while Aronov
et al. [14] leveraged relationships and other information such as
co-location at events to infer other potentially visited locations.
Aggregate Location Data. Prior work has also studied
how aggregate location time-series can lead to signiﬁcant
privacy loss. Pyrgelis et al. [58] presented a novel methodology
to study membership inference on such data, by formalizing
the problem as a distinguishability game, and showed that
such attacks are indeed feasible and can lead to signiﬁcant
privacy loss depending on different factors, such as the adver-
sary’s prior knowledge, aggregation group sizes etc. Shokri et
al. [66] investigated membership inference, and used a dataset
of Foursquare check-ins to evaluate their attack. In another
work, Pyrgelis et al. [59] studied how aggregate location
data can be leveraged to localize and even proﬁle individual
users, under different adversarial knowledge scenarios. Finally,
Xu et al. [70], demonstrated that it is possible to recover
individual user trajectories from aggregate location data with
high accuracy, based on the key assumptions that users’ daily
trajectories tend to be regular but also differ signiﬁcantly
among users. They also highlight that the uniqueness of the
recovered trajectories enable re-identiﬁcation attacks.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the privacy threats that arise from pre-
cise location (meta)data being publicly accessible in Twitter’s
API. By developing novel techniques for identifying a user’s
exact home and work location, and inferring sensitive infor-
mation through the reconstruction of a user’s location history,
LPAuditor highlights the true extent of the risk of exposing
such information. To make matters worse, our experimental
evaluation revealed how Twitter’s invasive policy of including
precise location data in previous app versions has signiﬁcant
implications, as it results in an almost 15-fold increase in the
number of users whose key locations are successfully identiﬁed
by our system. Given that users are most likely oblivious
to this privacy leakage, it is important to shed light on this
privacy-invasive practice. We hope that our work will serve as
a cautionary tale, equipping users with the means to manage
their personal data and avoid the risks of public exposure.
