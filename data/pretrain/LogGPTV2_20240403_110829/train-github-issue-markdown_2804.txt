**Current Behavior**
After upgrading to version 2.2.0 of Angular, the PrimeNG DataTable RowExpansion functionality no longer works correctly if the expansion template includes content that utilizes structural directives (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`). This issue was not present in version 2.1.2, as demonstrated in the provided Plunker.

**Expected Behavior**
The RowExpansion should properly render the template content and correctly set the template variables each time a row is expanded.

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue**
1. Visit the following Plunker: http://embed.plnkr.co/bJ0ln941VPbUX7KP3Mtk/
2. Expand the first row; the content should display correctly.
3. Expand the second row; the content will not reflect the data accurately.
4. Subsequent expansions will also fail to render the expected content.

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior**
This issue prevents the proper display of dynamic content within the RowExpansion, which is essential for many use cases where additional details need to be shown in a structured manner.

**Environment Details**
- **Angular Version:** 2.2.0 (also tested and failed with 2.2.1, but works with 2.1.2)
- **Browser:** Chrome 54 (though the issue is likely not browser-specific)
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.0

**Additional Information**
- The source code for the PrimeNG component can be found at: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/1.0.0-rc.4/components/datatable/datatable.ts
- Due to time constraints, I have not yet been able to create a minimal reproduction without PrimeNG.
