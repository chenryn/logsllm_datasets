**Current behavior**  
When I upgraded to version @2.2.0 PrimeNG DataTable RowExpansion is not
working any more if the expansion template contains content which utilizes
templates (e.g. structural directives).
It was still working in @2.1.2 (you can try in the plunkr above), so I don't
think it is related to PrimeNG.
Source of the PrimeNG component:
https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/blob/1.0.0-rc.4/components/datatable/datatable.ts
Sorry, but I haven't have time to strip down the problem (and the plunkr)
without PrimeNG.
**Expected behavior**  
RowExpansion has the correct template variables set. Should render the
template content every time correctly.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Check out my plunkr: http://embed.plnkr.co/bJ0ln941VPbUX7KP3Mtk/
Expand the first row: the content is shown correctly. Expand the second row:
the content is something different, not reflecting the data content anymore.
Any subsequent expansion is not working as expected.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
**Please tell us about your environment:**
  * **Angular version:** 2.2.0  
With the latest 2.2.1 version it fails too. But works with 2.1.2
  * **Browser:** Chrome 54 (but I assume it is not related to the browser)
  * **Language:** TypeScript 2.0
