From what I can see, LogisticRegressionCV.score always computes accuracy, not
the metric given by `scoring`. That's inconsistent with the behavior of
`GridSearchCV`. How do other `CV` estimators do that? I assume the same?  
That's pretty unfortunate and I think we should change it. We did the same
backward incompatible change in GridSearchCV before with a warning.
