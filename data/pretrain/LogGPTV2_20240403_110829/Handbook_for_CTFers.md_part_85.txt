users, for various reasons, users often choose not to update in a timely manner,
which can lead to the target is still affected by the Oday vulnerabilities that are
already a Nday vulnerability after a long time. In Sect. 12.3, we will combine several
common and effective system vulnerabilities to explain and analyze with the help of
Metasploit, so that everyone has a deeper understanding of this intranet
penetration tool.

12.1.2Installing andUsingNmap onLinux
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful port scanning software with a clear and
simple interface. It can easily scan the corresponxding port services and deduce the
corresponding operating system and version of the target to help penetration testers
to quickly assess the security of network systems.
Nmap’s installation is not complicated, and it supports cross-platform and mul-
tiple operation systems. We illustrated how to install the nmap in the following part,
see Fig. 12.9.
The Nmap installed in the above way is often not the latest version. If you want to
get the latest version, you can compile it from source at http://nmap.org/book/inst-
source.html.
After successful installation, enter the command “nmap" in the terminal, which
will output a brief user manual for the nmap, see Fig. 12.10.
The basic use of Nmap is as follows. Please notice that some of its parameters can
be used together.
(1) Basic scan command: nmap 192.168.1.1
By default, Nmap uses TCP SYN to scan the top 1000 ports and returns the results
(open, closed, filtered) to the user, as shown in Fig. 12.11.
(2) Host discovery command: nmap -sP -n 192.168.1.2/24 -T5 --open
Nmap will perform a ping-scan (parameter “-sP") as fast as possible (parameter
“T5'") and won’t try to parse the ip address back to domain names (parameter °-n),
returning all alive hosts (with the parameter °-open") to the user, see Fig. 12.12.

12.1.3Installing andUsingProxychains onLinux
Proxychains is a Linux proxy tool that enables any application to connect to the
network through a proxy. It can proxy both TCP and DNS traffics through proxies. It
supports proxy servers developed with HTTP, Socks4, Socks5 protocol, and support
to use multiple proxies at the same time. Note that Proxychains only forwards TCP
connections from specified applications to proxies, instead of all applications, Here

Then add the proxy servers to the list in the configuration file, enter the following
command in the teminal and modify it.
sudo vi /etc/proxychains conf
The results are shown in Fig. 12.16.
To use proxychains4, you need to enter the following command:

For example, using the Socks5 proxy to open Firefox.
proxychains4 firefox
If you want to use proxychains4 to proxy Metasploit traffics directly, you can
modify or add the local whitelist *localnet 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0" to your configura-
tion file, and then restart metasploit with * proxychains4 msfconsole? command.
Note that some modules in Metasploit do not use the proxy server set in this way

12.2 Port Forwarding and Proxies
During the penetration on a virtual target, if a foothold is successfully established in
the target network, it is possible to move laterally with local access to open service
ports in the target's internal network, such as port 445, 3389, port 22, etc., so port
Xjqrxa pasn sq oi paou sanbpuupan Kxoad pue Supremroj
As with the Trojan horse online, there are two modes of port forwarding
and proxies: active and passive. In active mode, a port is monitored on the server
side and the client actively accesses it. In passive mode, the client listens on the port
first and then waits for the server to connect. The choice needs to be made in advance
because of network limitations.
Generally, server firewalls are more restrictive on incoming traffic, but relatively
less so on outgoing traffic, so we usually choose the passive mode, which require a
public IP resource to allow the server to connect.
The following is to construct an environment in the form of a simulation
experiment, during the experiment, we constructed a multi-level routing, and the
lower-level routing cannot acess the external network, as shown in Fig. 12.21.
Here, virtual network cards of VMware are used to construct the LAN. The virtual
machine images are one Kali and two Windows Server 2012. Kali is an extermal
network machine. One Windows host assumes the port forwarding function, and the
other needs to be the target running the service to be forwarded.
Select Kali, choose “NAT" network mode in the "Virtual Machine Setings"
dialog, and assign the IP address as *192.168.40.145°, see Fig. 12.22. Readers may
be assigned different IPs, which does not affect the experiment.
Now add a virtual network card, select the “*Edit  Virtual Network Editor"
menu in VMware (see Fig. 12.23), add a network card, and set it to *Host Only
Mode". “Subnet Address*" can be set arbitrarily, such as 192.168.115.0, and
“DHCP" is set to “Enabled", see Fig. 12.24.

To simulate the intranet environment, the NICs of both Windows server 2012
virtual machines are set to VMnet2, and a new NAT-mode virtual NIC is added to
one of the hosts to enable it to interact with the external network. Figure 12.25 shows
the two NIC settings of one of the Windows hosts.
