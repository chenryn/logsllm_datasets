not conduct live ﬁre testing of weapons, nor should academic
researchers targeting the live Internet not attempt to ethically
measure their tool to show whether the attack would stand up
to real-world execution. Some systems from past and recent
literature test
their hypotheses relying on Internet routing
behavior beyond simulation. An example offensive tool which
tests using real-world BGP advertisements is SICO, which
can launch interception attacks with BGP communities. SICO
leverages PEERING [5], like this paper. Blink, again by Apos-
tolaki et al., which establishes fast connectivity using the data-
plane [17], was tested on the live Internet. SCION [66] and
Named Data Networking [65], both proposed "future Internet
architectures", are actively deployed on the live Internet.

D. Related Measurements
In the background, we covered relevant security literature.
Here, we cover related Internet measurement research. LIFE-
GUARD from Katz-Bassett et al. [22], [23] and Anwar et al.’s
Interdomain Policy exploration [1] use algorithm similar to
our return path steering methodology. They addressed steer-
ing return trafﬁc around link failures between Amazon EC2
servers distributed among data centers. However, our algorithm
explores greater depths in its breadth-ﬁrst search of all possible
paths from a single remote AS, rather than aggregating paths
available from many poisoning ASes. While not directly re-
lated to our steering algorithm, work on BGP communities can
inﬂuence inbound paths similarly to poisoning. Communities
in the wild have been studied by Streibelt et al. [57].
IX. CONCLUSION
in the original path. We found that of all
We have presented measurements demonstrating the limita-
tions of leveraging BGP poisoning in the real-world. Notably,
we found 77% of ASes evaluated could be successfully ma-
neuvered onto new, previously unreachable AS-links at some
point
types of
AS connectivity, only highly connected ASes were strictly
incompatible with BGP poisoning. When poisoning an AS,
we demonstrated that for roughly 30% of the Internet, using
non-standard IPv4 preﬁxes will maintain connectivity when no
other routable preﬁxes are available. Beyond connectivity, we
investigated default routing on the Internet and found that for
36% of ASes with only 2 providers, even in cases where the
primary provider is poisoned, the AS being maneuvered will
continue to route through the poisoned upstream AS. Finally,
we established the ﬁrst upper bound on the maximum AS-
path length routable on the Internet via an exhaustive search,
discovering that paths of up to 251 in length are accepted by
99% of the Internet when considering the customer cones of
ASes advertising such paths.
We summarize our key results, major takeaways, and
security ramiﬁcations in Table I at the beginning of this paper
and provide additional takeaway discussion in the prior section.
With these ﬁndings, we called out speciﬁc assumptions that
are now either validated or invalidated for systems such as
Nyx, RAD, Waterfall, and others. In particular, the placement
of decoy routers can effectively quell the impact of a RAD
adversary, while poorly placing decoy routers in the core of the
Internet leaves censors with vast territory to intercept trafﬁc.
For defense systems such as Nyx, we demonstrated that to
some extent, the ability to defend against DDoS under their
presented bandwidth models hold; however, the assumptions
made about the amount of poisons possible overall and the
speciﬁc ASes on the Internet able to be poisoned require
signiﬁcant changes to their described algorithms in order
to see real-world viability in the range of cases our study
shows. Beyond Nyx, RAD, Waterfall, and decoy routing, the
study we have presented carries implications for potential
alleys to better Internet model-building and other Internet
simulation/emulation systems that must model the Internet’s
de facto routing infrastructure.
Most notably from this study, we strongly recommend
all future work that targeting the Internet for its real-world
deployment go beyond simulation and passive measurement.
Researchers should lean into the behavior of network opera-
tors and practitioners, intentionally conducting ethical, well-
designed experiments that validate simulations in practice.
We have shown that inferred topologies alone nor passive
measurements can be the only validation in an era where the
true behavior of the inherently human-driven Internet deviates
strongly from inference. Like many other ﬁelds of science,
security researcher’s proposed hypotheses for building, defend-
ing, and attacking distributed systems need to be conducted in
the real-world before the proposed work is disseminated into
the literature and public discourse.
