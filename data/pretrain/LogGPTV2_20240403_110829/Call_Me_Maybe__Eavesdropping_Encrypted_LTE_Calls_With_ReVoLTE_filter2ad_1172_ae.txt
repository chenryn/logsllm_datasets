cation ﬂaws introduce security issues in the foundations of
LTE, implementation ﬂaws are examples of an insecure re-
alization of the speciﬁcation. Kim et al. [29] propose the
tool LTEFuzz, which allows to ﬁnd vulnerabilities in different

LTE implementations. Furthermore, conﬁguration ﬂaws intro-
duce vulnerabilities in cases where providers setup network
parameters in an insecure way. Chlosta et al. [17] analyze
multiple network conﬁgurations and ﬁnd conﬁguration ﬂaws
that enable an adversary to impersonate a victim to the net-
work.
LTE Cryptography. LTE (gen. four) encrypts radio transmis-
sions with secure encryption algorithms, e. g., AES. In con-
trast, the second generation (GSM) speciﬁes three encryption
algorithms, two of which have been broken in the meantime,
which allows a passive adversary to eavesdrop phone calls.
The A5/2 algorithm is purposely weak and already prohibited
to use [12, 22, 33]; the stronger but still insufﬁcient algorithm
A5/1 can be broken by consumer hardware and rainbow ta-
bles [14,20,41]. In scenarios where the phone or the provider
does not support VoLTE, GSM calls are still used and in case
of A5/1 encryption, the call can be eavesdropped.
VoLTE Security. The security of VoLTE implementation was
analyzed by Kim et al. and Li et al. [28, 31]. They found
attacks that allow caller identity spooﬁng and billing bypass.
In contrast to our work, the authors analyzed an active client
attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in the core network/IMS
conﬁguration and found identity spooﬁng or billing bypasses.
8 Conclusion
Data conﬁdentiality is one of the central LTE security aims
and a fundamental requirement for trust in our communication
infrastructure. We introduced the REVOLTE attack, which en-
ables an adversary to eavesdrop and recover encrypted VoLTE
calls based on an implementation ﬂaw of the LTE protocol.
Our attack builds upon a previously introduced keystream
reuse and extends it with an elaborate attack concept that
enables eavesdropping attacks in real-world commercial net-
works. In a series of preliminary experiments, we analyze the
different protocol and transmission characteristics of VoLTE
and provide an in-depth evaluation of network conﬁgurations.
Based on these insights, we conduct the REVOLTE attack
in a commercial network with a setup that costs less than
7000 $. Our results emphasize the need for short-term solu-
tions that avoid the exploitation in current mobile generations
and long-term solutions that help to provide data conﬁdential-
ity for upcoming generations that currently indicate the same
vulnerability.
