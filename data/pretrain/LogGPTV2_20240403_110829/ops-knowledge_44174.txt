User: I'd like to pass somehow user password for rsync_project() function (that is wrapper for regular rsync command) from Fabric library.
I've found the option --password-file=FILE of rsync command that requires password stored in FILE. This could somehow work but I am looking for better solution as I have (temporarily) passwords stored as plain-text in database.
Please provide me any suggestions how should I work with it.
Assistant: If rsync using ssh as a remote shell transport is an option and you can setup public key authentication for the users, that would provide you a secure way of doing the rsync without requiring passwords to be entered.
