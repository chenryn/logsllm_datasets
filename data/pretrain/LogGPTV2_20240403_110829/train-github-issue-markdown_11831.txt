I know there are more than a few target environment options, but was thinking
it would be nice if there were some basic targets of "es5" or "es6" so that
for modern node/iojs where generators and other es6 features are in the box,
they can be used (as well as newer browsers)...
I'm just thinking it would be nice if there were a less boilerplate option for
those environments that have the needed capabilities... or for that matter, a
self-detecting browser shim for a few different classes...
IE9 and IE10 need a lot more than say current chrome/ff or ie-edge. And node
0.xx more than iojs 2.x ... Just a small wishlist, and just some ideas on
this.. I'm sure it's probably been discussed
