Attribute Mappings for Locations
Standard Attributes in User Records
The following table specifies facts about the standard attributes, or data types, found in 
user records of Mac OS X data services. Use these facts when mapping LDAP or Active 
Directory domains to Mac OS X directory services.
Important:  When mapping Mac OS X user attributes to a read/write LDAP directory 
domain (an LDAP domain that is not read-only), do not map the RealName and the first 
RecordName attributes to the same LDAP attribute. For example, do not map both 
RealName and RecordName to the cn attribute. If RealName and RecordName are 
mapped to the same LDAP attribute, problems will occur when you try to edit the full 
(long) name or the first short name in Workgroup Manager.

RecordName: 
A list of names associated with a 
user; the first is the user’s short 
name, which is also the name of 
the user’s home directory
Important:  All attributes used 
for authentication must map to 
RecordName.
First value:  ASCII characters A–Z, 
a–z, 0–9, _,-
Second value: UTF-8 Roman text

system. Normally unique among 
entire population of users, but 
sometimes can be duplicated.

interpreted as 0, which is the 
UniqueID of the root user.

association
Signed 32-bit ASCII string of 
digits 0–9
Range is 1 to 2,147,483,648.

population of group records. If 
blank, 20 is assumed.
