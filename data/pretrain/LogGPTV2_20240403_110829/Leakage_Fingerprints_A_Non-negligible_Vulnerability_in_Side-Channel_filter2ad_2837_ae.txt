### 6.4 Guessing Fingerprints for Offset Identification

The following table represents a series of values, which are used to identify offsets in the context of fingerprint guessing. Each value is derived from a function \( Gf p(\theta[i] \% 16) \), where \( \theta[i] \) is an input and \( \% 16 \) ensures the result is within the range of 0 to 15.

| Index | Value |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     |
| 2     | 1     |
| 3     | 1     |
| 4     | 1     |
| 5     | 2     |
| 6     | 2     |
| 7     | 2     |
| 8     | 2     |
| 9     | 2     |
| 10    | 2     |
| 11    | 3     |
| 12    | 3     |
| 13    | 3     |
| 14    | 3     |
| 15    | 4     |
