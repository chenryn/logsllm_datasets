Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-sift-through-text-
with-regular-expressions has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it,
and include links to screenshots if possible.
I'm forced by 2nd assertion to write:
    var expression = /and+/gi;
which searches in testString for and or andd or anddd ... That's not the
purpose of the exercise.  
Also, the lesson is wrong about the regular expression: `/the+/gi`
> \+ means we want to find one or more occurrences of this pattern.
`g` after `\`, not `+`, tells to function `match` to find all occurrences of
this pattern in `testString`  
If we have to find a repeating succession of 'the' word, the regular
expression has to be `/(the)+/gi` at least.
