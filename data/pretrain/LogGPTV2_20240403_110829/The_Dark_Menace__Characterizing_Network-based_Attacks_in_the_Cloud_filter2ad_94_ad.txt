and median volumes. This implies that it would incur high costs and
waste resources if we overprovision attack detection and mitigation
solutions in hardware boxes. In comparison, elastic approaches that
dynamically adjust resource usage over time may be a more cost-
effective and efﬁcient solution. The outbound attack throughput
variations are relatively smaller, but for TCP SYN ﬂoods and TDS
attacks, we still see a 20x-30x difference between the peak and me-
dian volumes.
Throughput per VIP: Today, cloud operators mostly focus on pre-
venting large-volume attacks that may affect the cloud infrastruc-
ture, but they rely on tenants to secure their own services [47].
However, many of the attacks we investigated are smaller attacks
targeting individual VIPs. Therefore, we study the peak attack
throughput for individual VIPs and characterize the throughput dif-
ferences across VIPs (Figure 8) to understand the resources indi-
vidual VIPs need to defend against attacks.
We observe that some VIPs experience a high peak volume of
attacks at a certain time (ranging from 100 pps to 8.7 Mpps). At
times, the per-VIP peak volume is even higher than the median
throughput for the entire cloud. For example, a single VIP can expe-
rience up to 8.7 Mpps inbound UDP ﬂoods. The per VIP inbound
TCP SYN ﬂood has a peak of 1.7 Mpps. We found one inbound
TCP SYN ﬂood that caused a CPU spike at the software load bal-
ancer (SLB) appliance and resulted in a restart of that appliance.
However, the trafﬁc from that device was quickly and automatically
shifted to other SLBs.
There are large differences in the throughput volumes across VIPs.
For example, for inbound brute-force attacks, the VIP having the
peak throughput has 361 times larger volume than the VIP with
the median value; for outbound brute-force attacks, this ratio is 75.
Therefore, it may become too expensive to over-provision hardware
security appliances for individual VIPs based on their maximum at-
tack volumes. In comparison, resource management mechanisms
that multiplex the attack protection resources across VIPs are likely
to be more cost-effective.
Finally, we observe that for volume-based attacks (TCP SYN,
UDP, ICMP, and DNS reﬂections), the peak volume of inbound at-
tacks is 13 to 238 times higher than that of outbound. This is caused
by the differences in attack resources and targets between the Inter-
net and the cloud. For inbound attacks, there are more resources to
leverage in the Internet (e.g., botnets, easily compromised personal
machines) to launch high-volume attacks. These attacks also need
to have high volumes to break the VIPs in the cloud, which have
plenty of bandwidth and CPU resources. In contrast, outbound at-
tacks can only leverage a few VMs in the cloud, because it is hard
to compromise a large number of VMs or create multiple fake ac-
counts to get many free VIPs.
5.2 Attack duration and inter-arrival time
Attack duration: Figure 9 shows that both inbound and outbound
attacks have short duration with a median value within 10 minutes.
This is consistent with other studies of Internet attacks [38, 40].
Interestingly, port scan attacks have a median duration within one
minute for both inbound and outbound (but they can last for 100
minutes at the 99th percentile). There are several reasons that an at-
tacker may launch short-duration attacks towards or from the cloud:
(1) Shorter attacks are harder to be detected by cloud operators; (2)
an attacker may attack one target for a short time and if not suc-
cessful move quickly to another target. As a result, it is important
to detect such short duration attacks in a timely fashion.
At the 99th percentile, most attacks have a duration longer than
80 minutes or even for days. For example, the TCP SYN ﬂood
attack lasts for 85 minutes at the 99th percentile. This is shorter
than the previous study of Internet attacks [40], which observed

that 2.4% of the attacks take more than ﬁve hours. This could be
due to better security support in the cloud.
DNS reﬂection attacks last longer than others in both inbound
and outbound directions. These attacks can sustain for a long time
before being detected because they leverage many DNS resolvers
simultaneously and each resolver receives relatively low query rate.
Thus, it is hard to detect these attacks.
Ramp-up time: For volume-based attacks, we calculate the ramp-
up time of an attack from its start time to the time when the packet
rate grows to 90% of its peak. We observe a median ramp up time of
2-3 minutes for inbound attacks and 1 minute for outbound attacks.
Today’s ﬂood detection solutions take about 5 minutes to detect the
attacks [17, 48], and thus they are not fast enough to fully eliminate
the ﬂood attacks before they ramp up to affect the target with their
peak strengths.
Inter-arrival time: We measure the inter-arrival time as the inter-
val between the start times of two consecutive attacks to/from the
same VIP. Figure 10 shows that most types of attacks have a median
inter-arrival time of hundreds of minutes. The outbound TCP SYN
and UDP ﬂood attacks are shorter than inbound (about 25 minutes
vs. 100 minutes). This indicates that malicious VIPs launch pe-
riodic attacks frequently. Attack protection systems can leverage
such repeated attacks to identify and tune the right signatures for
ﬁltering attack trafﬁc.
We identify two types of UDP ﬂood attacks based on the corre-
lations of inter-arrival time and peak attack size. 81% of the attacks
have a median peak size with 8 Kpps but with large inter-arrival
time (a median of 226 min). The rest 19% of the attacks have a
median peak size with 457 Kpps, but with short inter-arrival time
(a median of 95 min). The ﬁrst type of small-scale, occasional at-
tacks are relatively hard to distinguish from normal trafﬁc and thus
they are hard to mitigate without signiﬁcant collateral damage. In
contrast, the large-scale, frequent attacks require the cloud security
operators to provision more resources to detect their trafﬁc signa-
tures and mitigate them.

INTERNET AS ANALYSIS
In this section we investigate the types of Internet ASes that are
commonly involved in attacks to the cloud and that are under at-
tacks from the cloud.
(b) Average of percentage of inbound attacks per AS in each AS type.
Figure 11: Different types of ASes generating inbound attacks.
6.1 Inbound attacks
Are source IPs spoofed? We investigate whether the Internet IPs
of inbound attacks are spoofed to understand the effectiveness of
blacklisting on preventing different inbound attacks. Similar to
prior work [40], we leverage the Anderson-Darling test (A2) [43] to
determine if the IP addresses of an attack are uniformly distributed
(i.e., an attack has spoofed IPs if A2 value is above 0.05). We ob-
serve that 67.1% of the TCP SYN ﬂoods have spoofed IPs. This is
contrary to the study in 2006 [38] which observed that most ﬂood
attacks are not spoofed.
AS classiﬁcation: We ﬁrst remove those spoofed IPs and then map
the IP addresses of inbound attack sources and outbound attack tar-
gets to AS numbers using Quova [11]. We use AS taxonomy reposi-
tory [27] to identify AS types, which include large ISPs, small ISPs,
customer networks, universities (EDU), Internet exchange points
(IXP), and network information centers (NIC). We further classify
big cloud (i.e., Google, Microsoft, Amazon), small cloud (i.e., web
hosting services), and mobile ASes based on the AS descriptions.
We count the number of attack incidents of different types for each
AS class if any of its IP is involved in the attack.
Figure 11a shows the distribution of attacks across different types
of ISPs. We observe that small ISPs and customer networks gen-
erate 25.4% and 15.9% of the attacks, respectively. For instance,
an ISP in Asia contributed to 3.53% of the total attack packets.
This is probably because these local or regional ISPs have relatively
less security expertise and weak defense systems, and thus they are
more likely to be compromised and leveraged by attackers.
When we calculate the average of percentage of attacks per AS
(Figure 11b), we observe that there are more attacks per AS from
big cloud and IXP. Individual ASes in small ISPs and customer net-
works do not generate many attacks on average.

bile ASes in each attack type.
(a) Percentage of inbound DNS or spam attacks in each AS type.
Attacks from big clouds: Figure 12 shows the distribution of at-
tack types that originated from big clouds. UDP ﬂoods, SQL injec-
tions, and TDS attacks are the majority types. This is probably due
to the availability of a large set of resources in big clouds to gen-
erate a high trafﬁc volume and a large number of connections. In
fact, big clouds contribute to 35% of TDS attacks with just 0.21%
of TDS IPs.
Attacks from mobile and wireless ASes: With the growth of mo-
bile devices, attackers can try to compromise and exploit their re-
sources for malicious activities. Given the relatively weaker soft-
ware model in mobile devices compared to desktop PCs and the
wide deployment of third-party apps on them, they are more likely
to be compromised by malware for launching attacks. Users may
also jailbreak the security restrictions and install tools (e.g., An-
DOSid or mobile LOIC) to participate in botnet activities [10]. In
fact, there are 2.1% of the inbound attack trafﬁc from mobile net-
works.
Figure 12 shows that mobile networks mainly generate UDP ﬂoods,
DNS reﬂections, and brute-force attacks. These attacks are harder
to mitigate because simple source-based blacklisting does not work
well for mobile devices. This is because most mobile devices are
often located behind a NAT. While NAT may become less common
with IPv6 adoption, there would be more ephemeral addresses.
Origins of DNS attacks: Figure 13a shows that the cloud we stud-
ied received a similar number of DNS attacks from all types of
ASes. Figure 13b shows that if we count per AS attacks, there are
more DNS attacks from IXPs. Our further investigation shows that
each DNS attack involved a median value of only 17 unique DNS
resolvers in the NetFlow records.
Origins of spam: Figure 13a shows that spam attacks are mainly
from large cloud, small ISPs, and customer networks. For exam-
ple, 81.0% of the spam packets are from Amazon Web Services
(AWS) [2] in Singapore.5 However, each individual small ISP or
customer network does not generate many attacks as indicated by
the number of per AS attacks shown in Figure 13b. This indicates
that it is easier for attackers to leverage the free trial accounts in
large clouds, the end hosts in small ISPs, and customer networks
to generate spams. Prior study of spams in the Internet [46] shows
many spams come from network information centers (NIC), but we
observed only a single attack from NICs in our data.
Geolocation distribution of inbound attacks: Figure 14a shows
the geographical distribution of inbound attack sources. The in-
bound attack sources are spread mainly across places in Europe,
Eastern Asia, and North America. Speciﬁcally, there is one AS in

It mainly generated UDP ﬂood, TDS and SQL attacks. There are
ASes from the west coast of North America that are involved with
more than 20% of the total inbound attacks.
6.2 Outbound attacks
Are outbound attacks clustered? Unlike Internet ﬂoods which
often target a single host [48], we observe outbound UDP ﬂood
target a median of 8 hosts, while TCP SYN ﬂoods often target a
median of 25 Internet hosts just in our sampled NetFlow data. This
means attackers often use cloud resources to attack a group of hosts
instead of individual IPs. We count the number of unique victim
IPs of outbound attacks in each AS to understand if the victims are
clustered on particular ASes. We ﬁnd that 80% of the attacks target
hosts in a single AS.
While prior work has shown that a small number of ASes are
involved in a signiﬁcant fraction of attacks in ISP networks [38]
and distributed intrusion detection system [50], we show that cloud-
related attack incidents are widely spread across many ASes. Top
10 ASes are targets of 8.9% of the attacks; top 100 ASes are targets
of 16.3% of the attacks. However, there is a small portion of at-
tacks responsible for the major attack trafﬁc. For instance, 40% of
the outbound attack packets were directed from three VIPs towards
a small cloud AS in Romania, which offers web hosting, online
gaming, and VPN services.
