Currently, GLTFParser and constants in GLTFLoader are scoped and cannot be
used in user-land.  
However, sometimes it is needed.
Usecases:
  * glTF-ish file may need special parsing using modified(extended) GLTFParser.
  * glTF models may be supplied in JSON or JSONP format from a WebApp API rather than files and need GLTFParser directly.
Also, `WEBGL_CONSTANTS` and other constants would be useful if available under
`THREE` or somewhere
What I would like to have is:
  * `THREE.GLTFParser`
and maybe:
  * `gltfLoaderInstance.gltfParser`
  * `THREE.WEBGL_CONSTANTS.FLOAT = 5126` and so on
