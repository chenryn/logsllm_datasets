User: Give several steps and tools for basic network troubleshooting.
Assistant: Steps: 1. Confirm the problem, record the failure phenomenon, and check with the user. 2. Check the hardware to ensure that the power supply, network cable, network interface, and transmission media of the network equipment and computer are normal. 3. Check the IP configuration to make sure that the IP address, mask, gateway, and DNS are configured correctly. 4. Use the ping command to check network connectivity, test whether data packets can be sent and received successfully, and confirm whether there is a network connection problem. 5. Check the routing table, and use the traceroute command to locate the bottleneck in the data packet transmission process, and locate the location and cause of the network failure. 6. Use application layer protocols such as telnet, ssh, and ftp to test port connectivity. 7. If none of the above steps can solve the problem, you need to perform packet capture analysis to further locate and solve the problem. Tools: 1. ipconfig/ifconfig command: used to view local network configuration information. 2. ping/tracert command: used to detect network connectivity. 3. telnet/ssh client: used to test port connectivity. 4. wireshark/tcpdump: Used for packet capture analysis to understand the details of the packet transmission process. 5. netstat command: used to view the network connection status and view the ports in use.
