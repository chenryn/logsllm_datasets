User: I'm trying to test and distribute my python application in script or executable form (client). I already have my openshift server setup and running. I'm confused on setting up port forwarding with other users to test it out with.
Do other clients (publicly) need to download rhc and run 'rhc port-forward appname' on their own machine or are there alternatives out there which can be accomplished using python internally by code?
This is kind of confusing and any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks.
Assistant: all the 'rhc port-forward appname' does is set up SSH tunnels behind the scenes. If you want people to tunnel into your appication you will need to get their public SSH key into your application as an approved key. Then you can set up an SSH tunnel whatever way you chose.
