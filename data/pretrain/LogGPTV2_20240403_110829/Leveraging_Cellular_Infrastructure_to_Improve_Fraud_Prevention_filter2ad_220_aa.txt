Abstract—The relationship between physical security and crit-
ical
infrastructure has traditionally been unidirectional - the
former being necessary to sustain the latter. However, certain
pieces of critical infrastructure hold the potential to signiﬁcantly
improve the security of individuals and their most sensitive
information. In this paper, we develop a pair of mechanisms for
cellular networks and mobile devices that augment the physical
security of their users’ ﬁnancial credentials. In particular, we
create FrauVent, a multi-modal protocol that provides users
with information related to a pending questionable transaction
(e.g., transaction value, location, vendor) in a way that improves
the available context for approving or rejecting such exchanges.
Through protocol design, formal veriﬁcation and implementation
of an application for the Android platform, we develop a robust
tool to help reduce the costs of fraud without requiring ﬁnancial
institutions to signiﬁcantly change their extensively deployed end
systems (i.e., card readers). More critically, we provide a general
framework that allows cellular infrastructure to actively improve
the physical security of sensitive information.

I. INTRODUCTION
The frequency with which ﬁnancial credentials are stolen is
well documented. Whether through phishing [25], [13], [22],
spyware [42], [27], card skimming [51], [47] or physical theft
of credit cards, traditional mechanisms for preventing fraud
are becoming less effective. For instance, in all but the last
of the above cases, users willingly provide their PIN codes to
the attackers. As such attacks become increasingly automated,
both banks and end users are being forced to deal with losses
on a more regular basis.
The academic and industrial communities have responded
with a number of solutions designed to improve the secu-
rity of ﬁnancial credentials. For instance, keychain fobs that
generate pseudorandom streams of bits for use as a second
authentication factor have become popular within defense and
education related organizations [38], [16], [33], [48]. These
additional authentication tokens make attacks attempting to
forge credentials, such as password guessing, signiﬁcantly
more difﬁcult. However, these and other similar systems have
not been widely embraced by the ﬁnancial industry for a
number of reasons. First, these devices and their supporting in-
frastructure are relatively expensive to purchase and maintain,
making them potentially unpalatable to many banks. Second,
average consumers are unlikely to remember to carry these
devices with them at all times, frustrating legitimate access
attempts. Finally, carefully crafted attacks [14] can entirely
circumvent protections offered by these devices. Accordingly,
more effective and robust mechanisms must be investigated.
In this paper, we develop a suite of protocols that allow users
and banks to more effectively collaborate on the detection and
prevention of fraudulent ﬁnancial credential use. We design
our application, FrauVent (i.e., Fraud Preventer), around the
increasingly likely probability that mobile phones are carried
by their owners during most point-of-sale transactions. This
multi-modal protocol allows clients to make informed deci-
sions about transactions using information about their physical
location in comparison to the source of a transaction. In
combination with traditional fraud monitoring infrastructure,
this mechanism can not only greatly improve the ease with
which end users can assist in fraud prevention, but will also
allow the nearly ubiquitously deployed cellular infrastructure
to take a more active role in protecting user data.
In so doing, we make the following contributions:
• Discuss shortcomings of currently available mecha-
nisms: While a number of other cellular-based solutions
have been proposed, they fail to address the issues raised
in this paper for a number of reasons. We discuss why
our approach is more robust by design.
• Design and formally verify the security of the Frau-
Vent application: We develop a multi-modal protocol
that allows users to apply contextual information (e.g.,
location information) to determine the legitimacy of a
transaction. We then use ProVerif [3], [4], [6] to provide
guarantees of the protocol’s security properties.
• Implement and characterize the performance of our
system: We build a prototype version of our system for
Android phones and then characterize the performance of
each mode of the protocol. We show that the currently
deployed credit card infrastructure (i.e., swipe terminals)
requires no modiﬁcations to support this protocol.
Realizing these mechanisms faces a number of signiﬁcant
challenges. Exchanges should not be forgeable by an adversary
positioned between the mobile device and the bank, including
an insider within the cellular provider [34]. Accordingly,
the user must participate at some level in such a system.

These protocols must also overcome difﬁculties of usability
when determining physical location. Making such connections
intuitive is a necessary component of creating a robust system,
as transactions that occur outside of a user’s normal geographic
range (e.g., neighborhood, city, state, country) are often those
most likely to be marked as fraudulent. Finally, our proposed
protocols must scale so that
their elevated use does not
overwhelm the often limited resources available to even high-
speed 3G cellular networks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion II provides an overview of related projects; Section III
deﬁnes threats and design goals of the solution; Section IV
gives background information on credit card systems and the
architecture of cellular networks; Section V details the design
of our system; Section VI discusses the implementation details
for both the backend system and the Android application;
Section VII offers additional discussion and challenges for
such a system; Section VIII provides concluding remarks.
II. RELATED WORK
Multi-factor authentication expands the set of credentials
required to gain access to a resource. For instance, by requiring
a legitimate user to present both a password (e.g., something
they know) and a physical token (e.g., something they have),
an adversary’s ability to gain access to a resource through the
seizure of any single factor is ideally eliminated. Recognizing
this, solutions ranging from pseudorandom number generat-
ing keychain fobs [38], [16], [33], [48], [12] and one-time
pads [28], [39] to assorted biometric scanners [41], [9] and
USB tokens [17], [49], [36] have been suggested. Whether
due to issues of solution scalability, overhead or simply the
requirement that all users carry some object that is not broadly
usable, such solutions have failed to be deployed on a very
large scale.
Credit card companies have introduced a number of exten-
sions to their cards to approximate multi-factor authentication.
The most basic protection, PIN codes, attempt
to prevent
malicious third-parties (e.g., card skimmers [51], [7], [20],
phishers [52], [26], etc) from being able to reuse or duplicate
card information for transactions other than the one approved
by their owners. However, the increasing prevalence of PIN
code interception by adversaries has signiﬁcantly limited the
protection offered by this method. Banks in Europe have re-
sponded with chip-and-PIN systems [32], [50]. Instead of only
requiring knowledge of the corresponding PIN code, the cryp-
tographically capable smart-card embedded credit card must
be in the possession of the person executing the transaction. In
spite of eliminating certain kinds of attacks, researchers have
demonstrated that such techniques are not a sufﬁcient means
of stopping fraudulent point-of-sale purchases [14].
Cellular phones have the potential to address many of these
issues. Unlike solutions requiring users to carry a potentially
cumbersome object only useful for authentication with one
particular network or service, cellular phones are already
carried by more than 84% of the population in the United
States and Western Europe [10]. Increasingly expressive user
interfaces and a wide range of communications interfaces
also make this platform attractive for such a task. A number
of researchers have attempted to address the problem of
credit card fraud through text messages [53], [29], [37] and
automated voice calls [30]. These approaches fail in reality for
a number of reasons. First, because there is no cryptographic
mutual authentication of the message itself and text messages
are easily spoofable, no real protection is offered to users.
Second, while cellular networks deliver a large number of text
messages, constrained wireless interfaces are unlikely to be
able to support an increase in text messaging equivalent to the
total number of credit card purchases made every day [44],
[45], [43]. Solutions that are more robust against the kinds of
adversaries mentioned above and sensitive to the limitations
of cellular networks must therefore be developed.
III. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
A. Threat Model
Banks and ﬁnancial institutions have long worked to reduce
the cost associated with fraud. Current algorithms detect
approximately 90% of such attempts through the use of a wide
range of factors [19]. Unfortunately, preventing the remaining
10% of fradulent activity is often viewed as more costly than
the fraud itself. We aim to help reduce such loss through the
use of informed user participation in questionable situations.
Key in developing a system to combat these outlier cases
is deﬁning an appropriate threat model. We ﬁrst argue that
the majority of card theft cases are the result of electronic
interception and not physical attacks. A user is far more likely
to have their credit card number and PIN stolen via an infected
browser/desktop machine, an altered card reader [14] or a
poorly protected database [18] than they are to have their
wallet stolen. While the second case certainly does happen,
an attacker forfeits the stealth they may temporarily gain by
surreptitiously recovering such information. As a second point,
the changing nature of stolen credential use makes traditional
fraud prevention mechanisms less effective. In particular, as
adversaries increasingly use stolen credentials a single time
to withdraw cash [18], [51], post-facto defenses are generally
unable to recover losses. We therefore assert that the use of
the right two factor authentication mechanism used at the time
of a transaction of questionable integrity can potentially help
mitigate such attacks.
Selecting the right second factor for authentication is chal-
lenging. As mentioned in Section II, a number of other re-
searchers have attempted to use mobile phones to address this
problem in the past. However, techniques of simply sending
text messages [53], [29], [37] or relying on caller ID [8] as
strong authenticators are easily spoofable. Systems such as key
fobs [38], [16], [33], [48], [12] and USB tokens [17], [49],
[36] have also been suggested, but often fail in the context of
banking due to users losing or forgetting to carry them. Smart
phones have the ability to perform strong cryptography, are
carried at nearly all times by users and possess increasingly
expressive interfaces, making them a good candidate to address
these issues.

particular, our protocols will make no changes to deployed
ATMs and credit card readers and will instead add minimal
extra processing in the back-end.
IV. OVERVIEW
The ability to establish a secondary channel for communi-
cation and to request location information using the cellular
network can signiﬁcantly augment the authorization process.
In this section, we will present an overview of credit card
authentication and authorization processes as well as the
features we will be using on cellular network.
A. Credit Card Systems
The credit card has become one of the most widely accepted
forms of payment today with more than 500 million credit
cards in circulation in the United States [23]. Its versatility,
usability, and ability to defer payment allows consumers to
generate more than 1.9 billion transactions a month [23]. We
discuss credit card transactions at a high level and note a
number of common practices within the industry.
Figure 1 illustrates a high-level credit/debit card infrastruc-
ture. Once a consumer or a cashier enters the credit card
information into the point-of-sale (PoS) machine, the request
is sent to a gateway where the authorizing party is determined
and forwarded. This can be a credit card company such as Visa
or MasterCard, or an issuing bank for debit cards. The issuer of
the card authorizes the requested transaction based on available
credit limit or a balance, previously known spending habits of
the user, and any other credentials collected on the PoS such
as the PIN number. Once the bank determines its response,
it is sent back to the gateway, which then is forwarded to
the PoS machine. This entire process typically takes less than
15 seconds, depending on the connection speed of the PoS
machine.
In order to save time between transactions, some merchants
choose to batch submit low-risk purchases, eliminating the
authorization process until the end of the day. This batching
is typically observed at vendors such as coffee shops where
typical transactions are less than ten dollars and the ﬂow of
