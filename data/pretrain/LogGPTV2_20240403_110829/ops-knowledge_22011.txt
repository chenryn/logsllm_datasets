User: With Python, I need to read a file into a script similar to open(file,"rb"). However, the file is on a server that I can access through SSH. Any suggestions on how I can easily do this? I am trying to avoid paramiko and am using pexpect to log into the SSH server, so a method using pexpect would be ideal.
Thanks,
Eric
Assistant: If it's a short file you can get output of ssh command using subprocess.Popen
ssh root@ip_address_of_the_server 'cat /path/to/your/file'
Note: Password less setup using keys should be configured in order for it to work.
