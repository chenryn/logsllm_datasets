works because only IP headers are translated (the SCTP checksum
does not cover the network-layer pseudo header). Further experi-
ments are needed to better characterize the nature of SCTP support
in these devices, for example, whether SCTP multihoming works
over those devices that do support a single-homed connection.
DNS: 14 of the tested devices accept connections on TCP port 53
(DNS), and 10 of them accept and respond to DNS queries on that
TCP port; this roughly agrees with [9]. ap forwards DNS queries
arriving via TCP over UDP, the others forward over TCP.
4.4 Observations and Discussion
The results in Section 4.1 indicate that although UDP binding
timeouts are relatively low for bindings that see little use (UDP-1),
bindings that see some bidirectional trafﬁc (UDP-2) and especially
bindings that see repeated bidirectional trafﬁc (UDP-3) are being
granted longer timeouts. (Although no device uses the IETF rec-
ommended 600 sec.) In this light, UDP keepalive intervals as short
as 15 sec, which are used by some applications, are perhaps overly
aggressive: the lowest measured timeout when a binding has seen
bidirectional trafﬁc is 54 sec. It is clear that there are a variety of
different behaviors among the tested devices, and that the timeout
applied to a binding depends more on what trafﬁc pattern is seen
than on what port numbers are used.
In Section 4.2, the lowest measured number of parallel TCP
bindings to a single server port is 16, and even the “best” devices
imposed a limit of ca. 1024, which is much smaller than the 16-bit
port number space. A low number of permitted parallel bindings
can interfere with important applications, such as web browsing:
modern browsers impose a limit on the number of concurrent con-
nections to a DNS name, which has caused content providers to use
multiple DNS names for a web server with one IP address. The in-
tent of this practice is to circumvent this browser limit in an attempt
to improve performance.
TCP binding timeouts vary much more widely than UDP time-
outs. Half the devices time out TCP bindings after less than 1 h,
which is much less than the IETF-recommended minimum of
124 min. This also means that TCP stacks that implement the
standardized minimum TCP keepalive interval of 2 h [6] will not
be able to reliably refresh TCP connections in many cases.
In addition to the speciﬁc results reported in this paper, our ex-
periments also exposed a few other interesting behaviors: First,
some devices use the same Ethernet MAC address for both their
WAN and LAN ports. In a typical conﬁguration, this should make
no difference, but it required us to connect the WAN and LAN
ports to physically different VLAN switches. Second, some de-
vices do not decrement the IP time-to-live (TTL) ﬁeld and few
honor a “Record Route” IP option, which can interfere with net-
work diagnostics and other uses of the TTL ﬁeld. Third, it was
unexpected to ﬁnd that some boxes fall back to only translating the
IP header when they encounter an unknown transport protocol.
Discovering that this “fallback” behavior is not uncommon raises
an interesting question for future transport protocol design. Would
it be possible to leverage this behavior, by avoiding dependencies
on the IP layer (such as the pseudo-headers for checksum calcu-
lation) in order to improve the chances for un-encapsulated and
un-relayed NAT traversal?
Finally, it is worth noting that no single home gateway consis-
tently performs better than others across all tests, which makes it
difﬁcult for application designers to target a “better” subset of de-
vices.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The results presented in this paper are a snapshot of an ongoing
study, but already present some interesting variations in home gate-
way behavior. The results cover 34 different home gateway models,
but do not necessarily reﬂect how frequent the observed behaviors
are in the deployed device base. We are planning to expand the
range of tests to investigate handling of TCP and IP options, to
measure the rate at which NATs are capable of creating new bind-
ings, more extensive DNSSEC, queuing and SCTP tests, measuring
the success rates of STUN [27], TURN [18] and ICE [26], inves-
tigate the support for ECN [24], IPv6 [8] and various IP and TCP
options, and more.
We are also continuing to expand the range of home gateways
in the testbed. All home gateways measured in this paper use an
Ethernet interface for their uplink. We plan to extend this study to
include already-donated DSL and cable modems, once a DSLAM
(DSL access multiplexer) and a CMTS (cable modem termination
system), which also have been donated after preliminary versions
of this study were presented, have been added to the testbed.
6. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Many of the home gateway devices were donated to the testbed,
and we would like to sincerely thank all donors. The results pre-
sented in this paper are a snapshot of a study that is continuously
being extended. Please contact the authors if you have suggestions
for additional or improved tests, or if you can donate a spare, un-
used home gateway to the testbed – we will cover shipping.
