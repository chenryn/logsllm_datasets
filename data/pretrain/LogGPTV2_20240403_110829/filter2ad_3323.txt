## 1. Introduction
End-to-end reachability is a fundamental service provided by the Internet. This study focuses on network outages caused by natural disasters [2, 5] and political upheavals [8]. We propose a new approach to outage detection using active probing. Similar to prior methods [3, 4], our method employs ICMP echo requests (pings) to detect outages. However, we achieve higher resolution and finer granularity, demonstrating that pings can effectively detect outages without additional probing.

The primary contribution of our work is the definition of how to interpret ping results as outages (ยง2). We define an outage as a significant change in block responsiveness relative to recent behavior. Additionally, we provide a preliminary analysis of outage rates at the edge of the Internet. Due to space constraints, this poster abstract only provides an overview of our approach; detailed validation is available in our technical report [6]. Our data is freely accessible at http://www.isi.edu/ant/traces/internet_outages/.

## 2. Methodology
Our method for detecting outages involves three main steps: active probing, identifying outages in individual address blocks, and correlating these into events.

### 2.1 Definition of Network Outage
For this study, a network outage is defined as a problem in the network core or near the target that prevents reachability from our vantage point. We monitor and manually remove outages local to the monitors. It is important to note that issues often affect only part of the Internet. Future work will include evaluating outages from multiple vantage points to distinguish between partial and Internet-wide outages.

### 2.2 Active Probing of Address Blocks
We collect data through active probing, leveraging our high-performance probing software used for studying the Internet address space [1].

#### Reviewing Address Probing
We begin by actively probing addresses in some or all analyzable /24 address blocks within the IPv4 address space. Probes are ICMP echo requests (pings) sent at 11-minute intervals over one to 14 days. These probes are spread over 11 minutes to minimize the impact on the target and to reduce the effects of burst losses. Responses are classified as non-responses, network or host-specific negative replies, other errors, and positive (echo reply). Non-responses and negative replies are interpreted as inaccessible networks, while positive replies indicate reachable networks. We survey all addresses in a random sample of 22k or 41k responding /24 blocks.

#### Outage-Specific Steps
For outage analysis, we map probe records into rounds, each 11 minutes long, with \( N_r \) rounds in a dataset. We account for clock drift and duplicate replies. Our whole-Internet outage system probes 20 addresses in all 2.5M measurable /24 blocks for IPv4 [6].

### 2.3 Probes to Outages
We identify outages by a sharp drop in the overall responsiveness of the block, with recovery indicated by an increase in responsiveness. Let \( r_j(i) \) represent the state of each address \( j \) in a given block at round \( i \), taking 1 for a reply and 0 if down. Figure 1 (left) shows a graphical representation of \( r_j(i) \): each green dot indicates a positive response, while black dots are non-responsive (the blue area on the right is after the survey ends). In this block, many addresses are responsive or non-responsive for long periods, as shown by long, horizontal green or black lines.

The coverage of a block at round \( i \) is defined as:
\[ C(i) = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N_s} r_j(i)}{N_s} \]
where \( N_s \) is the number of targets probed in a block (256 for experiments and 20 for operation). \( C(i) \) is a time series of block responsiveness over the observation period. An outage starts when there is a severe drop (90% or more) in \( C(i) \), compared to a running average \( \bar{C} \) over the last two rounds. The exact choice of the threshold is not critical, provided it is relatively large [6]. We graph \( C(i) \) in Figure 1 (bottom left), observing that it drops to zero for rounds 1640 to 1654, indicating an outage that appears as a black, vertical band in the top panel. We exclude blocks that are too sparse, considering blocks where fewer than 10% of addresses historically respond to be too sparse.

The result of this algorithm is a list of outages, represented as binary-valued time series \( \Omega(i) \), indicating when the block is down (\( \Omega(i) = 1 \)) or up (0). Outages incorporate data measured over the course of a round. Through controlled experiments, we verify that we detect all controlled outages lasting 1.9 rounds (about 20 minutes) and typically underestimate duration by about 0.5 rounds.

## 3. Preliminary Analysis
As an example of our outage detection method, Figure 2 visualizes outages during the January 2011 Egyptian revolution (Survey S38c). This visualization clusters blocks by similarity (as previously described [7]). Figure 2 shows the 400 blocks with the most outages, with time on the x-axis and each row giving the \( \Omega_j \) downtime for some /24 block, and colors keyed to country. There are two clusters of blocks with near-identical outage end times. Cluster (a) covers 19 /24s, corresponding to the February 2011 Egyptian Internet shutdown. Cluster (b) covers 21 /24 blocks for a slightly longer duration, related to flooding on the eastern coast of Australia. Our technical report validates these events with external data [6].

This event is one example of the kind of outages we observe. We have been monitoring from three locations (southern California, Colorado, and Japan) for over two years. Figure 1 (right) shows data for three years, with different shapes (open, closed, and asterisk) representing different locations. This figure suggests that our results are consistent regardless of the probing site and date, after removing outages local to the prober (dotted lines). Numerically, variation is low: the mean outage "area" is 0.33%, with a standard deviation of only 0.1%. Overall, our data shows that the Internet is approximately 99.7% up, or about 2.5 "nines" of availability.
