Specifying a file isn't required to run deno test. It will run all the tests
in the directory I'm running the command in.
    $ deno test -A
    Check file:///home/kyle/Projects/deno/react_app/env_test.ts
    running 10 tests from ./env_test.ts
    ...
I found that if I add the `--watch` flag, it wasn't finding any of the files.
    $ deno test --watch -A
    Watcher Test started.
    ok | 0 passed | 0 failed (0ms)
    Watcher Test finished. Restarting on file change...
I found that if I add a path like `.`, it is able to find the test files like
it can without the `--watch` flag.
    $ deno test --watch -A .
    Watcher Test started.
    running 10 tests from ./env_test.ts
    ...
I believe that the test command should be able to find the test files without
a path when using the `--watch` flag, like it can without the `--watch` flag.
