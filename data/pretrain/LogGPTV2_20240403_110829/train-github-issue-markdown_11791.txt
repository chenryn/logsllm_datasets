When using the `deno test` command, specifying a file is not required. By default, it will run all the tests in the current directory. For example:

```sh
$ deno test -A
Check file:///home/kyle/Projects/deno/react_app/env_test.ts
running 10 tests from ./env_test.ts
...
```

However, I encountered an issue when adding the `--watch` flag. The command was unable to find any test files:

```sh
$ deno test --watch -A
Watcher Test started.
ok | 0 passed | 0 failed (0ms)
Watcher Test finished. Restarting on file change...
```

I discovered that if I specify the current directory with the `.` path, the `--watch` flag works as expected and finds the test files:

```sh
$ deno test --watch -A .
Watcher Test started.
running 10 tests from ./env_test.ts
...
```

In my opinion, the `deno test` command should be able to find and run the test files without explicitly specifying a path, even when using the `--watch` flag, just as it does without the `--watch` flag.
