User: Here is what I would like to do.
Use web2py with MySQL.
To do that, I need to use source web2py rather than web2py.app
To use web2py, I need Python 2.5
I am having trouble building and installing Python 2.5
I downloaded Python-2.5.6.tgz from Python release page.
Now, I did 

./configure

and then 

make

Then, I get the following error.

gcc -c -fno-strict-aliasing -Wno-long-double -no-cpp-precomp
  -mno-fused-madd -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes  -I. -IInclude -I./Include   -DPy_BUILD_CORE -o Modules/python.o ./Modules/python.c 
  cc1: error: unrecognized command line option
  "-Wno-long-double" make: * [Modules/python.o] Error 1

Can anybody help me how to get rid of this error and install Python 2.5?
Here is gcc I am using

gcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build
  2336.9.00)

Your help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
Assistant: I have web2py on my iMac OSX Lion using the web2py app and MySQL. I haven't run into any reason why you can't use the app with MySQL.
