Figure 15: SWIFT reaction to TCP web downloads: (a) and (b)

avoids affecting 802.11a transmissions, while (c) shows that it does

we download the home page from www.apple.com every 3 sec-
onds. We average the throughputs of the TCP downloads and SWIFT
over 100ms intervals, and plot them as a function of time.
Results. Fig. 15 shows that SWIFT adapts to intermittent and bursty
web trafﬁc, without causing any performance impact on the narrow-
band user. Notice that the narrowband trafﬁc is indeed intermittent,
and that the TCP downloads are too short for narrowband to achieve
a peak throughput higher than 2-3 Mbps, despite the fact that the
auto-rate algorithm is sustaining 48 or 54 Mbps in this case.
We see that SWIFT throughput drops as soon as the user begins her
web download. This is because SWIFT falls back to a conservative
set of bins. SWIFT throughput then gradually increases as it tightens
its set of bins. However, this process is slower than the example in
Fig. 13 because SWIFT only uses measurements in the vicinity of
a narrowband transmission, as described in §5.1. It therefore needs
to wait for a longer time to acquire enough data points for each bin
choice. SWIFT converges on the right set of bins, and its throughput
stabilizes around t = 75 seconds. This throughput is lower than the
throughput that SWIFT achieved prior to the web downloads because
SWIFT is now avoiding bands that could affect 802.11a performance.
Throughout this process, SWIFT remains safe to 802.11a and does
not cause any noticeable impact on the TCP throughput.4
7.6 Network Results
Here, we show that SWIFT performs well even in a chaotic environ-
ment with multiple 802.11a devices, and multiple SWIFT nodes.
Method. In this experiment we use four wideband nodes and eight
802.11a nodes, creating six pairs of communicating nodes. We place
the four 802.11a pairs at locations A-H, and the two wideband pairs
at the locations labeled tx/rx and tx’/rx’ in Fig. 8. We then measure
the throughputs when running the network without any wideband
transmitters, with the wideband transmitters running NORM, and
with the wideband transmitters running SWIFT.
Results. Fig. 16(c) shows that, when NORM transmits simulta-
neously with 802.11a, it signiﬁcantly reduces 802.11a throughput.
While the throughput reduction of 802.11a pairs at different locations
is different, all pairs are impacted, with an overall average loss in
throughput of around 50%.
Figs. 16(a) and (b) show the throughput of the four 802.11a pairs,
with and without SWIFT. In this case, both pairs of SWIFT nodes
move away from the bins occupied by the 802.11a nodes, allowing
all 802.11a pairs to have essentially the same performance as in the
absence of SWIFT. Additionally, Fig. 16(c) shows that by utilizing
all bins not occupied by 802.11a, the SWIFT nodes are each still able
to get reasonable throughputs of 30-100 Mbps in the face of 802.11a.
This result shows that SWIFT can deliver an operational wideband
network, while ensuring that it does not affect multiple competing
narrowband nodes.
8 Conclusion
This paper addresses the problem of coexistence between emerging
wideband networks and narrowband devices with which they share
the unlicensed bands. We show that overly conservative designs
that avoid interference by running below the noise ﬂoor needlessly
sacriﬁce the throughput and the range of the wideband radios. In
contrast, a design based on cognitive aggregation, which adapts
its frequency bands and weaves together multiple non-contiguous
bands into one wireless link, can be as narrowband-friendly as the
conservative approaches, while achieving a signiﬁcant increase in
operating range and throughput.
Our results can be extended in multiple directions:
(a) Non-reactive narrowband devices: This paper addresses nar-
rowband technologies that react to interference in their band. Of
course, not all devices react to interference. We envision that SWIFT
can be extended to deal with such devices in one of two ways: ei-
ther by being conﬁgured to avoid known non-reactive bands if they
are present, or by having adaptive sensing recognize a device as
non-reactive if all narrowband bins can be reclaimed without any
identiﬁable reaction. In this case, SWIFT can fall back to a conser-
vative bin setting that avoids all bins with non-reactive narrowband
power.
(b) Coexistence of multiple wideband protocols: SWIFT selec-
tively avoids frequency bands used by narrowband devices, and
4The differences in TCP throughput with and without SWIFT are caused by varying
queue lengths in the wired Internet. In particular, note that the variations in downloads
between the two graphs are no greater than the variations within any one graph.

shares the spectrum with other cooperating wideband devices us-
ing the SWIFT protocol. However, the future may bring a variety
of wideband protocols. These systems need to ﬁnd a way to share
spectrum among different wideband technologies even when they do
not use the same protocol.
(c) Dynamic Range: Like other techniques that allow a node to
receive multiple concurrent signals [33], SWIFT’s nodes deal with a
wide range of signal powers and hence their performance improves
with a wider dynamic range of the system.
