### Security Vulnerability Report

**Identified by:** @EyalItkin

**Vulnerability Type:** Buffer Overflow (No Size Check)

**Vulnerability Location:**
- **Memory Address:** 0x000022B6
- **Affected Component:** Camera Firmware Update

**Description:**
A classic buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified in the camera firmware update process. This vulnerability is due to a lack of size checks, allowing an attacker to exploit the system and potentially compromise the camera.

**Impact:**
- **Compromised Camera:** The camera can be compromised through a malicious firmware update.
- **Firmware Types:**
  - **Plain Firmware:** Standard, non-malicious firmware.
  - **Malicious Firmware:** Firmware that contains malicious code.
  - **Malicious Update:** An update that installs malicious firmware on the target camera.

**Attack Vector:**
- **Target:** Camera
- **User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.

**Summary:**
The camera firmware update process is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the absence of size checks. This allows an attacker to install malicious firmware without requiring any user interaction, leading to a compromised camera.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper input validation and size checks in the firmware update process.
- Ensure that all firmware updates are signed and verified before installation.
- Regularly update and patch the firmware to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
