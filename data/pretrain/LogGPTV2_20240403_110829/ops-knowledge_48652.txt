Regularly back up data and store it in different locations to prevent data loss caused by hacker attacks. 5. Restrict access to sensitive data and strengthen database security protections. To sum up, preventing network attacks requires a full range of technical and management means, and only by comprehensively taking multiple measures can network security be ensured.
