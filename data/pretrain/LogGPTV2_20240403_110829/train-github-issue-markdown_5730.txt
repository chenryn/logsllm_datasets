## Problem Description
Dropdown component causing dom change error in hot reload. When the basic
Dropdown is rendered we get the following hot reloading error:
    Uncaught Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(..., .0.1.1.1.2.1.$1/=11.0.2.1.0.$2016-03-07T13=208=201-05=2001.1:$37.3.0.1.0): Unable to find element. This probably means the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g., by the browser), usually due to forgetting a  when using tables, nesting tags like , , or , or using non-SVG elements in an  parent. Try inspecting the child nodes of the element with React ID ``.
This is usually a result of bad formed HTML. We checked all components and
only the Dropdown is causing this problem.
