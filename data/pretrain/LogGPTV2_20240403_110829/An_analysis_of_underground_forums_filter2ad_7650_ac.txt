tion of private messaging events over the user’s associates. We then
looked at the 60%,70%, and 80% points in that distribution. Fig-
ure 5 suggests that users on LC exchange private messages with a
diverse set of individuals, versus users on traditional OSNs, who
interact with few of their friends. Wilson et al. [11] found that, for
users on Facebook, 20% of their friends account for 70% of their
interactions. In contrast, for users on LC, approximately 70% of
their associates are responsible for 70% of their private messages.
The corresponding graph for users linked via threads is similar.
5. MARKETPLACE
In this section we look at the types of goods and services ex-
changed on LC and CC, the two forums with the most well devel-
oped and active trading marketplaces. We ﬁrst look at what types of
goods are traded among these two underground communities, and
then analyze how social degree and reputation affect trading.
5.1 Merchandise
To determine what types of items are available on the forums,
we extracted thread titles containing the markers “[B]” or “[S]”,
denoting items that are being traded for and sought after, respec-
tively. We then wrote over 500 regular expressions to bin the items
into 18 categories; these hand-deﬁned categories include merchan-
dise, banking information, drugs, mailing and dropping services,
and a number of other commonly observed wares/services. We cre-
ated the categories based on domain knowledge of illicit goods and
by randomly sampling trading thread titles. Using our regular ex-
pressions, we categorized 87% of the 14,430 CC threads and 77%
of 31,923 LC threads. Because users typically list several items for
trade in a single thread, a thread may be counted in multiple cat-
egories. There is a long tail of merchandise types that we did not
cover with our regular expressions; for example, on LC, threads
mention such items as “Internet hack N95” or “Proteine - Inko X-
TREME Muscle Gainer”, while on CC, threads offer up such goods
as “Conrad.de Kundenlogins” or “Pall Mall umsonst”.
Tables 5 and 6 show the top 10 most commonly traded items on
CC and LC (respectively), ordered by the number of total binned
threads in the designated category. The thread column shows the
number of thread titles containing terms associated with the cate-
gory, while the user column shows the number of distinct users who
created those threads. The “B” and “S” columns denote threads
where items were being traded for or sought after, respectively.
The items most commonly traded for are ofﬂine/online payments,
including PayPal, cash, Ukash, and PaySafeCards (PSC). Over 5%
of all threads involve trading for ofﬂine/online payments on both
forums. Traders in the underground market prefer PSC, a type of
prepaid online currency that is widely used in Europe. Gaming ac-
counts, in particular Steam, are the second most commonly traded
item; credit cards and accounts make up the next two traded for

Top Percentile of Traders

items. While not shown in the table, drugs also made up a notable
number of traded items on CC: over 100 threads listed weed, 25
mentioned Viagra, and 15 speciﬁed speed.
Next, we look at the number of trading threads the top merchants
are responsible for. Figure 6 shows the relationship between the top
percentile of traders on both forums and the percentage of goods
traded. For example, the top 10% of the traders on both sites (mea-
sured by the number of trading threads created by the user) account
for 40–50% of the goods traded. One implication of this trading
distribution is that law enforcement can pursue the top tier traders
to shut down much of the marketplace activity. The top traders can
create multiple accounts to mask their activity levels, but accruing
reputation for possibly numerous accounts is nontrivial.
5.2 How Social Degree Affects Trading
Now, we analyze the effect of the social network on trading. Fig-
ure 7 shows how the median social degree measured in private
message links increases for users after posting trading threads on
LC. We order each user’s trading threads by time. Subsequently,
we compute the user’s PM social degree just before he or she cre-
ates each thread. We then bin that social degree with respect to the
thread’s posting order, taking the median over all users. The results
suggest that, as users trade more, they continue to interact with in-
creasingly larger numbers of individuals and hence, potential cus-
tomers. For LC, the median out and in degrees for the PM social
graphs increases at a roughly constant rate of four for every trading
thread created. The CC graph looks similar; the PM out/in degree
increases at a rate between one and two for each thread.
We now investigate how PM in/out degree affects the response to
a trading thread. Figure 8 plots the in/out PM degrees for LC users
before they post a trading thread against the number of PMs they
receive in the following week. In comparison, LC and CC mem-
bers receive on average 0.07 (standard deviation σ = 0.68) and
0.11 (σ = 1.19) private messages per week when issuing no posts
prior to that week. The graph suggests that traders with higher PM
social graph degrees receive more PMs in the week after they post
a trading thread. For CC, the numbers look similar, but become in-
creasingly noisier after an in/out degree of 30.
Lastly, we look at what fraction of private messages are sent by
new users to traders in the week following a trading thread post.
Figure 9 shows that for approximately 30% of all trading threads,
the posters receive only PMs from individuals they have interacted
with before. For 50% of the trading threads on LC and CC, 60–75%
of the PMs came from prior acquaintances. Finally, for approxi-
mately 20–25% of all trading threads, the trader interacted with
only new people.
5.3 Effect of Group Status
Figure 10 shows how a user’s group affects the responsiveness
to a trading thread; we focus on CC because LC does not contain
any data regarding user group transitions. We looked at the trading
threads posted by users at a certain group level. We then determined
how many PMs the users received in the week after posting trading
threads. Figure 10 suggests that a user’s group status does inﬂuence
how many PMs the user receives upon posting a trading thread.
Veriﬁed vendors and VIP members receive between 2–3 times more
response PMs than “newbies”.
5.4 Effect of Ratings
The only forum with an explicit rating system for trading trans-
actions is CC. The rating system is ternary: traders receive either
a positive, negative, or neutral feedback. Surprisingly, most of the
reviews are positive: of the 3,157 reviews ( 20% of discernible trad-
ing threads), only 67 were negative and 2 were neutral. Of the 67
negatively rated users, 43 were banned, and the rest were generally
rated negatively due to “poor” or “unfriendly” service. We suspect
that bad traders are outed publicly in separate thread posts (see Sec-
tion 6.2) and banned before being rated. Because so few users were
rated poorly, we do not differentiate between the rating types.
We now consider the effect of the rating system on the amount
of interest a trader receives (either in the form of response posts or
private messages) after posting a trading thread. Figure 11 shows
the effects of the ﬁrst 10 ratings on the median number of PMs
users receive in the week following a trading thread post. With zero
ratings, the median response PM count is one, but with a single rat-
ing, the median count rises to 15. The median PM count continues
to increase from there, though not in a well-deﬁned manner. While
rated traders receive more private messages, they do not experience
an increase in the number of response posts; the median response
post count remains constant at one. We speculate that the rating
system lends more credibility to a trader’s threads, and people are
not so quick to question the trader’s reputation in the public space.
5.5 Activity To First Rating
We now analyze how much activity users must participate in be-
fore they earn enough trust such that they engage in a business
transaction with another forum member. We measure the number
of actions users take (postings, private messaging) before they re-
ceive their ﬁrst ratings. Relying on the rating system is subject to
error, since users can conduct business outside of the forum, but it
provides us with some idea about how trust is earned. Figure 12
shows that, before approximately 50% of users received their ﬁrst
ratings, they posted around 60 times in 50 different threads, re-
ceived about 35 private messages from 13 users, and sent around
33 private messages to 13 users.
6. BANNED ANALYSIS
Some users in underground forums behave maliciously towards
other members. In this section, we look at the top reasons why users
are banned from the forums. We also investigate different proper-
ties associated with accusations of fraud in the marketplace.
