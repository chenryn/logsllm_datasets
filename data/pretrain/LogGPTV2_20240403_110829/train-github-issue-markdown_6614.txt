 **Describe the feature** :  
currently term aggregation execute below: the node coordinating the search
process will request each shard to provide its own top size term buckets and
once all shards respond, it will reduce the results to the final list that
will then be returned to the client.  
if try to get all terms agg, it will cause memory issue.  
this request is below:  
not based on top size term but top term on each shard's term dictionary and
return the agg. maintain a context for iteration to traverse all terms and get
exact results.
