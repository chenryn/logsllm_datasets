titleblackhat:us-23 Civil Cyber Defense: Use Your Resources to Defend Non-Profits as They Combat Human Trafficking and Subvert Authoritarian Regimes
Civil Cyber Defense volunteers and students challenge high-risk adversaries and threats such as human traffickers, authoritarian regimes, and surveillance being conducted on journalists. By utilizing academic resources, OSINT skills, and free/open-source tools, civil cyber defenders are supporting vulnerable non-profits, protecting volunteers, journalists, and activists while defending human rights. There is a need in the cybersecurity industry for more civil cyber defenders. Recommendations will be made as to how your organization can support and/or volunteer your time and tools to provide protection to vulnerable organizations that have high risks, face advanced and persistent adversaries, but have modest resources.
