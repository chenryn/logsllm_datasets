Fig. 9. Overall TCP scanning packets generated towards destination IP addresses and ports by exploited (a) CPS and (b) consumer IoT devices.
Internet [9]. The TCP scanning packets were generated by
a total of 12,363 compromised IoT devices (55% consumer
IoT devices). We illustrate the overall distribution of the TCP
scanning packets generated by compromised IoT devices in
both, CPS and consumer realms in Figure 9. On average,
exploited consumer IoT devices generated more TCP scanning
packets per hour, as compared to exploited IoT devices in CPS,
with about 382,000 and 318,000 packets for each device type
respectively. Nevertheless, while the compromised IoT devices
included more consumer IoT devices (55%),
the analysis
showed no linear correlation between the number of compro-
mised IoT devices and the total generated scanning packets per
hour (Pearson’s r ≈ 0 and p >0. 05). In addition, exploited
consumer IoT devices targeted relatively more destinations per
hour, as compared to those deployed in CPS, with an average
of 280,000 and 215,000 destinations respectively. Interestingly,
while the exploited IoT devices in CPS scanned relatively
less number of destinations, they seemed to be scanning a
wider range of destination ports as compared to consumer
IoT devices, with an average of 576 scanned ports per hour
(min = 271 and max = 987). Exploited consumer IoT
devices on the other hand, scanned a smaller range of ports
per hour (average of 246 ports), except at interval 119, where
a sudden increase in the number of scanned ports is clearly
observed (Figure 9b). Investigating the data at interval 119
revealed 734 IoT devices that were generating TCP scanning
packets. Among those devices, a single IP camera hosted in
the Dominican Republic was responsible for scanning 10,249
ports on 55 destination addresses.
1) Scanned Protocols/Services: We summarize the top 14
protocols/services that received the most scanning activities
from the exploited IoT devices in Table V. Telnet received
the highest portion of all TCP scanning packets (about 50%),
followed by HTTP and SSH, which received signiﬁcantly less
number of packets, with about 9.4% and 7.7% of all TCP
scanning packets respectively.

Overall, we observed that HTTP, Telnet, Kerberos, and
iRDMI, were scanned by a noticeably larger number of

compromised IoT devices as compared to other protocols (Ta-
ble V). In addition, a signiﬁcantly larger number of compro-
mised consumer IoT devices were scanning HTTP, Kerberos,
and iRDMI protocols, contributing towards the majority of
generated TCP scanning packets at these ports (TableV). On
the other hand, while only one exploited IoT device in a
CPS realm was actively scanning port 3387 (BackroomNet),
almost all scanning packets generated towards port 21677 were
also found to be generated by compromised CPS IoT devices
(negligible TCP trafﬁc was generated by a single compromised
consumer IoT device).
The distribution of the TCP scanning packets targeting
the top 5 protocols/services is illustrated in Figure 10. It
is important to note that most of these protocols were also
associated with the recent IoT-initiated cyber attacks (e.g., the
Mirai botnet and its variations) [3]. In fact, our analysis
revealed a number of compromised IoT devices that were
actively involved in scanning these protocols. Moreover, these
compromised devices were corroborated to perform malicious
scanning by comparing them against a publicly available threat
repository (Cymon [35]), as elaborated in Section V. In what
follows, we present further analysis with regards to the top
scanned protocol/services.
Telnet. It is clearly observed that Telnet received the highest
amount of TCP scanning packets from 1,196 exploited IoT
devices. In addition, slightly more compromised consumer IoT
devices (54%) were scanning Telnet as compared to those
deployed in CPS, generating about 63% of all TCP scans.
Moreover, a total of 7 compromised IoT devices contributed
towards 55% of all TCP packets targeting Telnet. These ex-
ploited IoT devices, which were hosted in different countries,
represent three IP cameras, one router, DVR, and printer, and
two devices in CPS associated to power utilities and utility
networks. Interestingly, these compromised IoT devices were
also associated with malicious scanning as indexed by Cymon.
SSH. We noticed sudden increases in the overall scanning
activities towards SSH at intervals 32 and 69 (Figure 10),
with about 242,000 and 253,000 TCP packets generated by
compromised IoT devices respectively. Surprisingly, only a
hand full of compromised IoT devices, mainly those in CPS,
were generating the majority of the TCP scans at
these
intervals. In particular, two exploited routers hosted in Russia
and Australia, and three compromised IoT in CPS (two hosted
in China and one in Brazil), generated about 93% of the
scans at interval 32. Interestingly, the three exploited IoT in
CPS, which generated about 80% of the scanning packets at
interval 32, were also found to generate the majority of all
scanning trafﬁc at interval 69 (about 90%). In fact, all of
the ﬁve aforementioned compromised IoT devices were also
associated with malicious scanning and/or SSH brute force
attacks by Cymon.
BackroomNet. We noticed that BackroomNet was scanned by
a single compromised IoT in CPS located in Canada, which
operated BACnet/IP (used in building automation). As shown
in Figure 10, the intensive scanning activity started at interval
113 (April 16), generating over 6.2 million packets during
