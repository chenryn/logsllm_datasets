This week Chrome announced their intent to ship WebGL 2.0 so I guess it's
about time to start adding support!
There are already some PRs that add support to `WebGLRenderer` for some of the
new features but, somehow, it didn't feel it was good idea to make
`WebGLRenderer` support both `webgl` and `webgl2`.
Say hello to `WebGL2Renderer`! `2ff9d41` 👋
A new renderer not only will save us from tons of conditionals but also will
give us the chance of cleaning things up; starting with only supporting
`BufferGeometry` ✌️
Sorry for all the people which PRs didn't got merged because of my indecision!
