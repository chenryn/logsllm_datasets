**ATT&CK ID:** T1052.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over USB

**Description:**
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data using a USB-connected physical device. This technique is particularly relevant in scenarios where the target network is air-gapped, meaning it is isolated from external networks. In such cases, an adversary might exploit a USB device introduced by a user to exfiltrate sensitive information. The USB device can serve as the final exfiltration point or as a means to transfer data between otherwise disconnected systems, effectively bypassing the air gap.
