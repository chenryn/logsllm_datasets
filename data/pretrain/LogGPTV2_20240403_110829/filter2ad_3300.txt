## Abstract

This paper presents the development and implementation of an effective voice communication system in a TDMA, multi-hop mesh network using low-cost, low-power platforms. The primary usage scenarios include enabling local voice communication in village-like settings in developing regions and supporting on-site local communication among teams during emergency responses. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We demonstrate the functionality of an 802.15.4-based, low-cost, low-power local communication system (Lo3) using custom-made handsets and off-the-shelf platforms. (2) We show the practicality of LiT, a full-fledged TDMA-based, multi-hop, multi-channel MAC protocol for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. (3) We present implementation-based evaluation results, demonstrating that LiT achieves practical synchronization and robust operation despite wireless packet errors. As part of the demonstration, we showcase LokVaani, an interactive voice application for local communication using the Lo3 prototype.

## 1. Introduction

In this work, we aim to enable effective voice communication in a multi-hop wireless mesh network using low-cost and low-power platforms. To achieve this, we introduce Lo3, a low-cost, low-power, local communication system based on 802.15.4 technology. Lo3 is designed to support applications such as two-way interactive voice, stored voice messaging, and community alerts, making it suitable for use within a village or for on-site local communication among teams, such as during emergency response. The use of a mesh network helps reduce overall infrastructure costs, which we estimate to be around U.S.$1-2K (Section 3).

While 802.15.4 is well-suited for embedded wireless messaging, it is challenging to enable effective voice communication on low data rate (250Kbps), duty-cycled, resource-constrained platforms. Our contributions include:

- **Demonstration of Lo3 Prototype:** We showcase the working of an 802.15.4-based Lo3 prototype using custom-made handsets and off-the-shelf Tmote-Sky platforms.
- **Practicality of LiT Protocol:** We demonstrate the feasibility of LiT, a full-fledged TDMA-based, centrally-controlled, multi-hop, multi-channel MAC protocol for real-time applications, especially on resource-constrained platforms.
- **Evaluation Results:** We present implementation-based evaluations, showing that LiT achieves practical synchronization and robust operation in the face of wireless packet errors, with minimal control overhead.

As part of the demo, we present LokVaani, an interactive voice application for local communication using the Lo3 prototype. Figure 1 illustrates the setup, where a two-way interactive voice call is established using 802.15.4-enabled mobile handsets, routed through a multi-hop mesh network with nodes running the LiT MAC protocol.

## 3. LokVaani: Demonstrating Interactive Voice

### Setup and Node Types

LokVaani is designed to demonstrate interactive voice communication in the Lo3 system. The system consists of two types of nodes:

1. **Infrastructure Nodes:** These serve as intermediate nodes for broadcasting control packets and supporting data flows.
2. **Handset Nodes:** These originate voice calls and do not serve as intermediate nodes.

The network activities are centrally controlled by a special infrastructure node called the root. For infrastructure nodes, we use the 802.15.4-based Tmote-Sky platform, which includes an MSP430 microcontroller and a CC2420 radio, running TinyOS (v2.1.0). Initial experiments showed that the Tmote-Sky platform is not powerful enough to handle voice processing for handset functionalities. Therefore, for handset nodes, we developed a custom handset using a TI-based C5505 USB stick module. This module interfaces with an 802.15.4-compliant CC2520 radio and includes a TMS320VC5505 DSP (100MHz CPU, 320KB RAM) for voice processing and an AIC3204 codec chip for voice input and output. The voice sampled at 64kbps is encoded into a 5.9kbps voice stream using a Speex implementation on the C5505 DSP platform.

### Working of LokVaani

In the demo, we set up a sample configuration with 9 nodes, where 7 nodes are used as infrastructure nodes and 2 nodes as handsets. The LiT TDMA MAC is implemented on all nodes. The TDMA frame length is set to approximately 60ms, consisting of 1 control slot (12ms), 1 contention slot (10ms), and 4 data slots (each 9ms). We enable a two-way interactive voice between two 802.15.4 handsets. The 5.9kbps Speex codec generates 15 bytes every 20ms, resulting in 45-byte packets generated every 60ms by the source, transmitted to the destination over multiple hops in the network.

### Evaluation Results

We evaluated LiT on a 19-node testbed. Key performance metrics include:

- **Time Synchronization:** The relative clock drift between sending and receiving nodes is typically 1-2 ticks (1 tick = 30.5µs) over a 30-second period, which is highly effective.
- **Contention Slot Usage:** The usage of contention slots, used for call setup, is mostly less than 2%, leaving ample slots available.
- **Flow-Setup Latency:** The worst-case flow-setup latency is 2 seconds, which is tolerable in practice.
- **Data-Path Delay:** The delay, which depends on the number of hops, is mostly less than 300ms.
- **Jitter:** The average jitter in the data path is 1-2ms, leading to a MOS score of 3.8, which is considered good in practice.

These results demonstrate the suitability of LiT for real-time voice communication.

### Challenges and Design Choices

Designing LiT involves several challenges, including supporting real-time and non-real-time applications while meeting non-trivial requirements such as built-in time synchronization, dynamic routing, dynamic flow setup and teardown, flexibility in scheduling algorithms, robust handling of wireless errors, and duty-cycling support.

Figure 2 outlines the key design choices in LiT:

1. **TDMA-Based System:** LiT uses TDMA, which provides good support for scheduling and duty-cycling in multi-hop mesh networks. The TDMA MAC frame includes control, contention, and data slots.
2. **Central Control:** LiT is centrally controlled, simplifying the coordination of network tree, time slots, and multiple channels compared to a distributed approach.
3. **Multi-Channel Capability:** LiT supports multiple channels, enhancing throughput if channel coordination is efficient. The centralized TDMA approach eases multi-channel coordination.
4. **Connection-Oriented:** LiT is connection-oriented, requiring a connection formation phase to specify the time-slot and channel of operation for each node in the data flow path.

Additionally, LiT extensively uses soft-state mechanisms to maintain network state and handle wireless errors gracefully. Soft-state is particularly useful for avoiding inconsistencies in schedule dissemination and maintaining routing state at the root to handle node failures.

To our knowledge, this is the first system to demonstrate the practical implementation of a wireless multi-hop TDMA system for real-time applications.
