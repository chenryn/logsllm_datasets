Abstract—According to recent research, motion sensors avail-
able on current smartphone platforms may be sensitive to speech
signals. From a security and privacy perspective, this raises a
serious concern regarding sensitive speech reconstruction, and
speaker or gender identiﬁcation by a malicious application having
unrestricted access to motion sensor readings, without using the
microphone.
In this paper, we revisit this important line of research and
closely inspect the effect of speech on smartphone motion sensors,
in particular, gyroscope and accelerometer. First, we revisit the
previously studied scenario (Michalevsky et al.; USENIX Security
2014), where the smartphone shares a common surface with a
loudspeaker (with subwoofer) generating speech signals. We ob-
serve some effect on the motion sensor signals, which may indeed
allow speaker and gender recognition to an extent. However, we
also argue that the recorded effect on the sensor readings is
possibly from conductive vibrations through the shared surface
instead of direct acoustic vibrations due to speech as perceived in
previous work. Second, we further extend the previous work by
analyzing the effect of speech produced by (1) other less powerful
speakers like the in-built laptop and smartphone speakers, and (2)
live humans. Our experiments show that in-built laptop speakers
were only able to affect the accelerometer when the laptop and
the motion sensor shared a surface. Smartphone speakers were
not found to be powerful enough to invoke a response in the
motion sensors through aerial vibrations. We also report that in
the presence of live human speech, we did not notice any effect
on the motion sensor readings.
Our results have two-fold implications. First, human-rendered
speech seems potentially incapacitated to trigger smartphone
motion sensors within the limited sampling rates imposed by
the smartphone operating systems. Second, it seems that even
machine-rendered speech may not be powerful enough to affect
smartphone motion sensors through the aerial medium, although
it may induce vibrations through a conductive surface that these
sensors, especially accelerometer, could pick up if a relatively
powerful speaker is used. Overall, our results suggest
that
smartphone motion sensors may pose a threat to speech privacy
only in some limited scenarios.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent developments in the mobile device industry have
seen an increase in the capabilities of the smartphone hardware
to support applications that provide a comprehensive user
experience. Motion sensors have played an important role
in this task by collecting information about a user’s activity,
movement, and orientation. Accelerometers and gyroscopes are
two of the most commonly used sensors on these devices that
measure the motion and orientation of the device. However,
recent studies have suggested a security ﬂaw in these sensors
by noticing a sensitiveness towards low frequency audio sig-
nals (speciﬁcally, speech). In particular, it has been believed
that there exists a possibility of turning these sensitive sensors
into microphones for picking up speech signals [1], [2].1
The possibility of turning motion sensors into microphones,
capable of recording speech, has very adverse real-world
implications. These motion sensors are readily available on
smartphones and other smart wearable devices that have
become a predominant feature in everyone’s life. A unique
fact about motion sensors on current smartphone platforms,
speciﬁcally Android, is their unrestricted access. An applica-
tion does not require special permission from the user to access
the motion sensor readings. Hence, a malicious application,
by obtaining access to motion sensor readings, may be able
to achieve a similar threat
level as directly accessing the
microphone (that requires explicit permission) and recording
an unsuspecting victim’s voice or conversation.
The security threats of a malicious application gaining
access to an unsuspecting victim’s voice or conversation are
particularly devastating. Sensitive information can be leaked
in surreptitious manner if the malicious application is able to
reconstruct speech from motion sensor readings. For example,
sensitive verbal communications would be exposed, including
information such as credit card numbers and social security
numbers as the victim speaks into or near the phone such
as over a phone call. In addition, various aspects of the
eavesdropped speech signals can be utilized for speaker and
gender identiﬁcation. This threat violates the privacy of the
victim(s) by revealing the identity and gender information
that may otherwise be considered personal and should not be
revealed unless proper permission has been granted by the
involved parties.
In addition to human-rendered speech, machine-rendered
speech also has the potential to be exploited by gaining access
to motion sensors. A particular example could be closed
auditorium or a meeting hall that is soundproof in order to
avoid acoustic eavesdropping from outside world. If speech

keywords” for voice commands based on accelerometer. In this paper, our
focus is on malicious use case of detecting speech through both gyroscope
[1] and accelerometer readings.

is being communicated inside the hall using loudspeakers, a
smartphone placed near the loudspeaker may pick up speech
from the loudspeakers through its motion sensors. Thus, the
attacker may be able to compromise the speech privacy of
those present in the meeting. Since loudspeakers serve to
amplify the sound, the effect on motion sensors may be more
pronounced than live human speech thereby facilitating the
attacker’s task. Other examples for such a scenario could
be private speeches or dinners where speech privacy is an
essential requirement.
Another scenario of machine-rendered speech leakage may
involve a user placing their smartphone in vicinity of their
laptop while using the laptop’s speakers. In this scenario, the
sound from the laptop’s speakers could possibly be picked up
by the motion sensors of the user’s smartphone. An extension
to this case would be speech emanating from the smartphone
speakers that could be picked up by the motion sensors of
a smartphone. The in-built laptop and smartphone speakers
are usually less powerful (than loudspeakers) which may have
an impact on the motion sensors’ capability to record speech
generated by such commodity speakers.
In this work, we systematically explore the reaction of
motion sensors to speech signals under different environments.
We speciﬁcally consider possible threat scenarios and mark
out the ones where speech privacy attacks that exploit motion
sensors may be possible. As such, we do not build or improve
upon any such attacks that already exist in literature. Our as-
sumption is that in all our potential threat scenarios, exploiting
motion sensors for speech recognitions (as proposed in [1],
[2]) would be feasible and their accuracies can potentially be
improved with sophisticated machine learning, increased sam-
pling rate, and an increased sample size. In the initial phase,
we revisit representative prior scenarios that were investigated
in [1], [2] using machine-rendered speech. Since machine-
rendered speech can be adjusted to have varying levels of
loudness, these scenarios serve to outline the requirements
that should be met in order to have a noticeable effect on the
motion sensors. In addition, we design and study the effect of
speech on motion sensors in other novel settings that have not
been considered before, to explore the broader reach of this
category of threat to user’s speech privacy.
Further, we consider a natural scenario of speech signals
rendered by a human subject in close proximity of the phone.
Since the assumptions of previous work [1], [2] suggest that
the motion sensors are responsive to low frequency audio
signals (especially speech) to some extent, we measure the
susceptibility of the motion sensors against human speech. The
scenario involving live human speech has not been reported
in prior research [1], [2].2
Our Contributions: We dissect the threat to speech privacy
using motion sensors and assess its realism by analyzing the
scenarios in which speech signals, traveling through air or
conductive solid surfaces, affect the motion sensor readings.
We do not seek to extend or improve upon the attacks
developed in [1], [2] rather ﬁnd out
the scenarios where
such attacks may be deployed successfully for compromising
speech privacy. We believe that our work makes the following
key contributions:
1) Effect of Machine-Rendered Speech on Smartphone
Motion Sensors: We observe the effect of machine
rendering of the human speech on accelerometer and
gyroscope readings in several settings. Using frequency
and/or time domain analysis, we show that while there
was no apparent change in sensor readings when there
was no interaction between the physical world of the
machine and the smartphone, some effect was observed
when the machine and the device shared a surface (this
setting mimics the scenario tested in [1]3).
This analysis seems to indicate that the sensors picked
up surface vibrations or conductive vibrations, but not
the acoustic aerial vibrations. As accelerometer sen-
sor has been shown to pick up surface vibrations of
keystrokes, making it possible to decode the typed in-
formation [3], we suggest that the surface, on which the
smartphone and the speech rendering device is placed,
plays an important role in the conduction of sound
alongside the capability of the speech generating device.
In particular, we ﬁnd that relatively powerful loudspeak-
ers (such as subwoofers) may be able to create such
noticeable vibrational effects. In addition, in-built laptop
speakers were able to produce faint response in the
accelerometer when the laptop and the motion sensor
shared a surface. Smartphone speakers were not power-
ful enough to invoke a response in the motion sensors
through aerial vibrations. This analysis is presented in
Section VI-B-VI-D.
2) Effect of Live Human Speech on Smartphone Motion
Sensors: We measure the effect of human speech on
the motion sensor readings (Section VI). Using same
methodology as above, we did not notice any signiﬁcant
changes in the motion sensors’ measurements indicating
that these sensors may not be signiﬁcantly impacted
by the human-rendered speech signals. We validate this
result with a number of male and female speakers. This
analysis is presented in Section VI-E.
Implications and Signiﬁcance of Our Work: We believe
that our work has important implications (a summary of our
primary insights is captured in Section VII Table I). Our ﬁrst
key result is that human-rendered speech may potentially be
incapable of triggering the smartphone motion sensors within
the limited sampling rates (200Hz for Android) imposed by the
mobile operating systems. This fact may bear good news for
the security community since zero-permission motion sensors
may not be exploited for directly deducing sensitive live
speech spoken by a human entity.
Our second major insight is that even machine-rendered

speech may not be powerful enough to impact smartphone mo-
tion sensors “through air”, although it may induce vibrations
through a conductive surface that these sensors could pick
up. However, we believe that conducting vibrations represents
an indirect (possibly less common) threat scenario involving
a relatively powerful speaker that may also be a positive
implication to the ﬁeld of speech privacy.
Overall, the broader signiﬁcance of our work is decon-
structing the perception in the community that motion sen-
sors can be exploited to compromise human conversations
on smartphones. Live human speech was not tested in [1]
while we have included different scenarios including human
speech and speech through laptops and smartphone speakers.
We show that the threat perceived by [1] does not go be-
yond loudspeaker/Laptop-Same-Surface scenarios. Such per-
ceived threats raised by the potential of speech construction,
speaker identiﬁcation, and gender identiﬁcation based on zero-
permission motion sensors would have serious implications
to the society as a whole. However, given that the research
pointing to these threats is in its nascent stage [1], [2], it is
very important to examine in detail the threat posed by this
type of side channel attack under common use case scenarios
where motion sensors could be exploited thereby threatening
speech privacy.
Speciﬁc to the context of speech inference through motion
sensors, it is important to re-validate the threat, especially
given that the notion of this threat is appealing to people and
has already made a signiﬁcant impact through media coverage
in premium outlets worldwide [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10],
[11]. This may have created a sense of insecurity among the
readers. Our work, on the contrary, shows that speech infer-
ence, speaker identiﬁcation and gender identiﬁcation based on
current smartphone motion sensors may not be feasible in all
situations, given that human-rendered speech does not seem
to have a direct effect on the readings of these sensors in such
conditions. The machine-rendered speech effect seems limited
to conductive vibrations, which are dependent on the contact
surface and the audio source.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Motion sensors are a small piece of technology that measure
and record a physical, motion-relevant property. This measure-
ment or reading is then utilized by an application for required
purposes. Accelerometers and gyroscopes are the common
motion sensors deployed on smartphones. An accelerometer is
used to measure movement and orientation and the gyroscope
is used to measure angular rotation, across x, y, and z axes.
Motion sensors have been shown prone to acoustic noise
particularly at high frequency and power level in [12], [13],
[14], which showed that MEMS gyroscopes are susceptible
to high power, high frequency noise that contains frequency
components in proximity of the resonating frequency of the
gyroscope’s proof mass. This concept of work was further
utilized by Son et al. [15] to interfere with the ﬂight control
system of a drone using intentional sounds that were produced
by a Bluetooth speaker attached to the drones with a sound
pressure level of 113dB. This attack was enough to destabilize
one of the target drones used in the experiment due to ﬂuctu-
ations in the output of the gyroscope from the interference of
the noise near the resonant frequency of the sensor.
The use of motion sensors (gyroscope, in particular) as a
microphone to pick up speech signals was ﬁrst reported by
Michalevsky et al. [1]. They showed that the gyroscope sensor
in smartphones might be sensitive enough to be affected by
speech signals. Since gyroscope sensor in smartphones has
a sampling rate of 200Hz, there exists an overlap with the
frequency range of human voice especially at the lower end
of the spectrum.
In another work done by Zhang et al. [2], it was shown
that accelerometer readings could be affected by speech. In
particular, they reported that it was possible to detect the
voice commands (hotwords) spoken by the user through the
accelerometer sensor.
Both [1] and [2] used speech that was produced by either a
loudspeaker or a phone speaker to test its effect on the sensors.
The Gyrophone [1] setup tested the impact of speech generated
by a loudspeaker (with a subwoofer) on a phone placed on
the same surface as the loudspeaker. AccelWord [2] tested
the impact of speech generated by the phone speaker. We re-
investigate both approaches in our work and extend them to
other possible scenarios that have not been studied before.
In addition, there are examples of motion sensors leaking
information other than speech, thereby compromising user
privacy through another class of attacks. Cai et al. [16] used
motion sensors to infer keystrokes from virtual keyboards
on smartphone’s touchscreen. Using vibration patterns from
different parts of the keyboard, they were able to recover
more than 70% of the keystrokes. This work was extended
by Owusu et al. [17] by extracting 6-character passwords by
logging accelerometer readings during password entry. Xu et
al. [18] performed a similar study and were able to extract
conﬁdential user input (passwords, phone numbers, credit card
details etc.) using motion sensors. In a work similar to [19],
Miluzzo et al. [20] showed that it was possible to identify tap
location on smartphone’s screen with an accuracy of 90% and
english letters could be inferred with an accuracy of 80%.
III. MOTION SENSOR DESIGN
Motion sensors in smartphone and other smart devices
are implemented as micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)
that uses miniaturized mechanical (levers, springs, vibrating
structures, etc.) and electro-mechanical (resistors, capacitors,
inductors, etc.) elements developed using microfabrication.
They are designed to work in coordination to sense and mea-
sure the physical properties of their surrounding environment.
MEMS Gyroscope: A gyroscope is a motion-sensing device,
based on the principle of conservation of momentum, that can
be used to measure angular velocity. An MEMS gyroscope
works on the principle of rotation of vibrating objects or
Coriolis effect [21]. This effect causes a deﬂection to the
path of the rotating mass when observed in its rotating
reference frame. MEMS gyroscopes fall in the category of

vibrating structure gyroscope as they use a vibrating mass in
their design. The Coriolis effect described above causes the
vibrating mass to exert a force that is read from a capacitive
sensing structure supporting the vibrating mass.
that should be taken into account in the experiments that affect
the behavior of the motion sensors: (1) Source of speech, (2)
Medium through which the audio travels, and (3) Pressure
level of speech.
MEMS Accelerometer: An accelerometer is an electro-
mechanical device that can be used to measure gravity and
dynamic acceleration such as motion and vibrations. The
basic design of an MEMS accelerometer can be modeled
as mass-spring system. A proof mass (an object of known
quantity of mass) is attached to a spring of known spring
constant, which in turn is attached to the support structure. An
external acceleration causes the proof mass to move, causing a
capacitive change that is measured to provide the acceleration
value. It may also be noted that the accelerometer does not
measure the rate of change of velocity rather it measures
acceleration relative to gravity or free-fall.
IV. PRELIMINARIES AND ATTACK SCENARIOS
In this section, we discuss some preliminary notions that
will be used in our analysis of motion sensor behavior in the
presence of speech. We also examine the signal characteristics
of speech and the response of motion sensors in the frequency
range of the speech. We further look at scenarios that could be
potential avenues for executing a side channel attack against
speech privacy by exploiting the motion sensors.
A. Basic Audio Principles
The fundamental frequency for speech is between 100Hz to
400Hz. The fundamental frequency for a human male speech
lies in the range 85Hz-180Hz and for a human female from
165Hz-255Hz. The fundamental frequency may change while
singing where it may range from 60Hz to 1500Hz [22]. The
sampling frequency of the MEMS sensors could range up to
8kHz. For example, the sampling frequency (also referred to
as output data rate) in the latest Invensense motion sensor chip
MPU9250 is described as 8kHz for the gyroscope and 4kHz
for the accelerometer [23]. However, the operating platforms
on smartphones often place a limit on the sampling frequency
of these devices. This limit is often implemented in the device
driver code and is 200Hz for Android platform [1], [2] in order
to prevent battery drain from frequent updates.
Nyquist sampling theorem states that to capture all the
information about the signal, sampling frequency should be
at least twice the highest frequency contained in the signal.
For the MEMS motion sensors embedded in the smartphones,
the sampling frequency is restricted to 200Hz that implies that
they can only capture frequencies up to 100Hz. Hence, the
motion sensor may only be able to capture a small range of
the human speech in the sub-100Hz frequency range although
due to aliasing effect we can expect higher frequency speech
to feature in the sub-100Hz range as reported in [1].
B. Experimental Attack Scenarios
In order to test the effect of speech on MEMS motion
sensors, we conceptualize different scenarios that encompass
the intended objective of this work. There are three factors
1) Source of Speech: Speech can be generated through
various sources that we broadly classify into two cat-
egories: human voices and machine-rendered speech.
Human voices could further be broken down into male
voices and female voices. Machine-rendered speech in-
volves rendering of a human voice through a speaker
system. In our experiments, we use (a) a powerful speech
generating device like a conventional loudspeaker with
subwoofers (that boost low frequency sounds and may
induce vibrations), and (b) in-built laptop speakers and
smartphone speakers that are less powerful, as possible
sources of speech.
2) Audio Transfer Medium: To consider the effect of
speech on motion sensors, we need to take in account
the medium through which an audio signal
travels
to the motion sensors. The transmission of speech to
motion sensors could be through vibrations in the air
or vibrations within the surface shared by both the
speech generating device and the motion sensors. We test
conduction of sound through air and through commonly
used surfaces such as wood and plastic.
3) Sound Pressure Level: Sound pressure level
is an
indicator of the loudness of sound and is measured in
