ABSTRACT
We present BackFi, a novel communication system that en-
ables high throughput, long range communication between
very low power backscatter IoT sensors and WiFi APs using
ambient WiFi transmissions as the excitation signal. Specif-
ically, we show that it is possible to design IoT sensors and
WiFi APs such that the WiFi AP in the process of trans-
mitting data to normal WiFi clients can decode backscatter
signals which the IoT sensors generate by modulating in-
formation on to the ambient WiFi transmission. We show
via prototypes and experiments that it is possible to achieve
communication rates of up to 5 Mbps at a range of 1 m and
1 Mbps at a range of 5 meters. Such performance is an or-
der to three orders of magnitude better than the best known
prior WiFi backscatter system [27, 25]. BackFi design is en-
ergy efﬁcient, as it relies on backscattering alone and needs
insigniﬁcant power, hence the energy consumed per bit is
small.

INTRODUCTION
Embedded and connected gadgets - colloquially referred
to as the Internet-of-things (IoT) - are increasingly making it
possible to continuously monitor our bodies, personal lives
and surroundings to improve health, energy usage, security
and so on. These gadgets (e.g. wearable, ﬁtness/health track-
ers, security cameras/microphones, thermostats [35]) inte-
grate with cheaply available sensing technology to continu-
ously measure physical variables such as temperature, heart
rate, ambient sounds, etc. and upload them via wireless links

to the cloud. Analytics applications then analyze such data
to implement useful functionality such as ﬁtness monitoring,
intruder detection, regulating HVAC, etc. The future is likely
to bring many more such devices helping us instrument more
parts of our lives and surroundings, and enable us to measure
and analyze almost every aspect of our lives.
We will refer to these IoT gadgets as either IoT sensors,
or tags, or simply sensors in the remaining of our paper de-
pending on the context. To widely realize the IoT vision, we
believe that the wireless connectivity on these devices needs
to satisfy three key requirements:
• R1: Sufﬁcient throughput & range: A typical such gad-
get produces anywhere between a few Kbps (e.g. tempera-
ture sensors measuring every 100 ms) to a few Mbps (e.g.,
security microphones/cameras recording audio/video), and
can be placed anywhere in the home or on the body. So the
wireless link from the gadget to the wired gateway con-
nected to the Internet should provide at least a few Mbps
of uplink throughput and 1-5 meters of range.
• R2: Very low power design: These gadgets need to be
able to operate for a long time without requiring battery
replacements, or ideally without batteries at all. Recent
work has demonstrated the possibility of powering these
devices primarily using power harvesting from ambient
RF sources such as TV and cellular signals. A typical RF
powered device can harvest upto 100 microwatts of power
[51, 44, 29] from TV signals. Hence, ideally the gadget’s
radio should provide the necessary throughput and range
using a few tens of microwatts of power to be operable
without batteries. If feasible this would eliminate the need
for dedicated powering infrastructure such as RFID read-
ers.
• R3: Reuse ambient signals: Ideally the IoT sensors should
be able to piggyback their data on ambient, widely preva-
lent communication signals such as WiFi, Bluetooth etc.
For example, while a WiFi AP is transmitting a packet to
a standard WiFi client, an IoT sensor should be able to
modulate its own information on the ambient WiFi signal
and communicate its own data back to the AP. However
this should not interfere with the normal WiFi communi-
cation from the AP to the client. If such a capability is
feasible, then one can imagine being able to provide con-
nectivity to IoT sensors using infrastructure that is already
being widely deployed for standard wireless communica-
tion, thus reducing complexity and cost.

signal to be received while the WiFi device is transmit-
ting [17, 20, 43, 12, 8, 11, 9, 8, 26, 16, 39, 10]. Speciﬁ-
cally, the backscatter signal is a modulated version of the
transmitted signal itself. Hence self-interference cance-
lation has to be modiﬁed to ensure that the backscatter
signal itself does not get canceled. We design novel self-
interference estimation techniques that protect the backscat-
ter signal from any degradation due to cancelation.
• Third, we invent novel demodulation and decoding algo-
rithms that can estimate ﬁne-grained changes in the backscat-
ter signal to decode the IoT sensor data. Speciﬁcally, we
show that WiFi backscatter can be modeled as a chan-
nel that is linear but time-varying modifying the IoT sen-
sor data. BackFi incorporates novel decoding algorithms
that can continuously track the time-varying channel and
use standard diversity combining techniques such as Max-
imal Ratio Combining (MRC) to deliver a reliable, high
throughput link [13].
We prototype BackFi and show that it can provide 5 Mbps
of throughput at 1 m range and at least 1 Mbps at 5 m range.
In comparison the best performing prior WiFi backscatter
system [27, 25] provides a throughput of up to 1 Kbps, a
range of less than a meter. We also show that BackFi has
minimal impact on the operation of the standard WiFi net-
work whose ambient signals it is piggybacking on to backscat-
ter its own data.
We also note that the focus of this paper is on the uplink
from the IoT sensor to the BackFi AP. The reason is that the
IoT applications that we are designing for are bottle-necked
on the uplink. These gadgets (such as ﬁtness trackers, home
sensors, wearables, etc) are collecting a lot of sensor data
and need to upload them to the cloud and downlink often
isn’t needed, or if it is, very low throughput of a few Kbps
sufﬁce [35, 53]. Hence in the rest of the paper we will focus
on the uplink, but note that prior work has already demon-
strated WiFi backscatter designs (which can be used with
BackFi too) for the downlink that can provide upto 20 Kbps
[27]. We further note that although we have chosen WiFi
signaling for the description and implementation of BackFi,
the system is applicable for other types of communication
signals like Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc., as well.
2. RELATED WORK
BackFi is most closely related to recent work on WiFi
backscatter [27, 25]. The prior design also uses ambient
WiFi transmissions to backscatter data. Speciﬁcally, IoT
sensors encode data in binary decisions of whether or not
to backscatter the received packet transmission which is de-
tected as changes in RSSI/CSI at a nearby helper WiFi de-
vice that is also receiving the packet from the AP. The de-
sign needs a helper device because the prior design doesn’t
have self-interference cancellation, hence the transmitting
AP cannot detect changes in RSSI/CSI while it is transmit-
ting due to large self-interference. Since information is en-
coded in binary decisions that span an entire packet, the in-
formation rate is only 1 bit per WiFi packet. The range is
Figure 1: Overview of BackFi backscatter system : The AP trans-
mits packet that is meant for the WiFi client (in blue), the transmit-
ted signal (in red) is also reﬂected by reﬂectors in the environments
like walls. The IoT sensor also receives these transmissions, and
modulates its data on it and backscatters the signal to the AP (in
green).
To the best of our knowledge, no current systems satis-
ﬁes all three requirements. Recent work on WiFi backscat-
ter [27, 25] is the closest, but it does not satisfy R1, it only
provides around 0.5 Kbps of uplink-throughput and a range
of 1 meter which is insufﬁcient for many applications. RFID-
based systems satisfy R1 [55, 19, 49] and some of them sat-
isfy R2, but not R3. They would require the widespread
deployment of dedicated RFID reader infrastructure as well
as require their own spectrum band of operation in the unli-
censed band. Standard communication radios such as WiFi
or Blue-tooth Low Power would satisfy R1 and R3, but clearly
cannot satisfy R2, they require between 30 − 50 mW (Blue-
tooth) to several hundred mW (WiFi) of power to operate.
Our goal is to design a radio uplink for IoT sensors that
satisﬁes all the above requirements. We present BackFi, a
novel communication link design between backscatter IoT
sensors and WiFi radios. The key contributions are a IoT
sensor design for backscattering WiFi signals, and a novel
radio circuit and algorithm design at the WiFi AP which dou-
bles up as the (AP) reader decoding the backscatter signals
from the IoT sensor. The AP reader operates while it is send-
ing a standard WiFi packet to a standard WiFi client as seen
in Fig. 1. The design satisﬁes the throughput and range re-
quirements described above, it delivers at least 1 Mbps of
throughput even at a range of 5m and much higher through-
puts upto 6.67 Mbps at shorter ranges of a meter, To put
these performance numbers in context, they are between one
to three orders of magnitude better than the best known WiFi
backscatter system [27, 25].
BackFi’s design makes three key technical contributions:
• First, we design a novel low power IoT sensor that can
backscatter standard WiFi signals while being able to sus-
tain high data rates of around 5 Mbps. The IoT sensor con-
sists of a low power design for phase modulations ranging
from BPSK to 16-PSK as well as mechanism for detect-
ing WiFi transmission on which IoT sensor data can be
modulated and backscattered.
• Second, a novel design of the WiFi AP radio such that it
can receive the backscatter signals even while it is simul-
taneously transmitting a WiFi packet to a standard WiFi
client. We leverage recent work on self-interference can-

the IoT sensors to be close to detect changes in RSSI/CSI.
The reason is that the helper device needs to detect the changes
in RSSI/CSI while it is receiving the strong WiFi transmis-
sion from the AP. This WiFi transmission essentially acts as
interference to the detection of weak changes in RSSI/CSI
induced by the tag’s decision to backscatter or not, and thus
limits range.
BackFi on the other hand does not have any of these lim-
itations. Because it modulates information by changing the
phase of the received WiFi signal at a much faster rate through-
out the WiFi packet, it achieves three orders of magnitude
higher throughput. Its range is an order of magnitude higher
because self-interference cancellation enables the reader to
completely clean out the effect of the ambient WiFi trans-
mission and detect ﬁne-grained changes in the backscatter
signal. Finally BackFi provides a framework to analyze en-
ergy/bit, which is independent of platform (FPGA, ASIC,
discrete) and the technology choice for implementation. How-
ever we note that the prior WiFi-backscatter system required
no changes to the WiFi AP. BackFi does require the addition
of self-interference cancellation hardware. So the trade-off
is increased hardware complexity for a much higher through-
put and range.
BackFi advances the state-of-the-art in backscatter com-
munication by being able to provide the following:
Improved backscatter decoder: BackFi’s decoder presents
a ﬁrst formal framework to decode backscatter on wide-band
signals. All the prior backscatter systems use tone as the
excitation signals, whereas BackFi uses wideband signals.
Further this framework can improve the decoding of the tone
BackFi is related to a large body of work on RFID sys-
tems [19, 55, 50, 49, 23, 22, 52, 46, 45, 54, 14, 3], which use
dedicated, powered reader infrastructure to supply power as
well as receive data from the RFID IoT sensors [30]. The
IoT sensors themselves are designed to be low power and
may or may not have batteries. However the cost of deploy-
ing and maintaining dedicated reader infrastructure has tem-
