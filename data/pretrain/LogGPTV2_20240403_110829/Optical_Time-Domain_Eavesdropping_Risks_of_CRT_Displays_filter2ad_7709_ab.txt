Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are evacuated electron
tubes with a photocathode. Received photons can trigger
the emission of electrons, which are then accelerated with
high voltage and multiplied in a cascade of further elec-
trodes. A single received photon results in an entire cloud
of electrons hitting the anode, contributing to the measured
current. Photomultiplier tubes have response times in the
nanosecond range and their sensitivity can be adjusted eas-
ily over many orders of magnitude.

I used a Hamamatsu H6780-01 photosensor module
(Fig. 1), which can be operated with radiant sensitivity lev-
els in the 101–105 A/W range [15]. It can therefore be used
under a quite wide range of light conditions. This device
consists of a small robust metal package containing a pho-
tomultiplier tube and a high-voltage generating circuit. It
can be operated conveniently from a 12 V lab power sup-
ply. A separately applied 0.25–0.90 V control voltage Uc
adjusts the radiant sensitivity of the sensor to

The radiant sensitivity is the quotient of the output current
generated by the sensor and the radiant energy received by
the sensor on its aperture (8 mm diameter). When oper-
ated within the speciﬁed parameters, a photomultiplier is
a highly linear light-controlled current source. To prevent
damage to the sensor, care must be taken to ensure that the
maximum allowed average output current of 100 µA is not
exceeded, by selecting the control voltage appropriately.
According to the data sheet, the anode-current rise time
of the H6780 photomultiplier module is 0.78 ns, an order of
magnitude faster than the pixel time tp of commonly used
video modes. Its high sensitivity allowed me to connect it
directly to the 50 Ω input of a digital storage oscilloscope
with a resolution of 40 µV.
4.2. Measurement method
In order to characterize phosphor response times, I used
several test video signals that showed either a single pixel or
a 320-pixel-long horizontal line, each in full intensity red,
green, blue, or white on a black background. Using both
short and long pulses provides the data necessary to char-
acterize very fast (tens of nanoseconds) as well as much
slower (millisecond) features. The signal timing used was
the VESA 640×480@85Hz video mode, in which the elec-
tron beam traverses a 320 mm wide screen with 18 km/s.
The decay curves of zinc-sulﬁde based phosphors can
vary signiﬁcantly under different drive conditions [16]. The
EIA standard for the characterization of CRT phosphor de-
cay times [11] therefore requires for measurements a ﬁxed
beam current of 100 µA. Lacking the equipment to measure
such a current directly at the high-voltage anode connection,
I simply used a default setting of monitor controls (100%
contrast, 50% brightness, color temperature 6500 K, mon-
itor powered up for at least 30 min) and the full intensity
color combinations that are most frequently used for text
display. The resulting luminosity measurement is therefore
with respect to a known video signal voltage, not a beam
current.
Placed 0.25 m in front of the center of the screen sur-
face with an aperture of 50 mm2, the photosensor, as seen
from a pixel, covered a solid angle of around 0.8 msr. The
oscilloscope that recorded the photosensor signal was trig-
gered from the vertical sync signal on pin 12 of the feature
connector of the driving VGA card. It recorded with 8-bit
resolution at a sampling rate of 5 GHz over 40 µs the single-
pixel signal and with 125 MHz over 2 ms the 320-pixel line.
Averaging each signal over 256 frame repetitions reduced
noise.
4.3. Results
Taking into account the solid angle covered by the photo
sensor, its exact control voltage and resulting radiant sen-
sitivity, as well as the input impedance of the oscilloscope,
the recorded voltage can be converted into a radiant inten-
sity (power per solid angle). The radiant sensitivity used
is the one given in the sensor data sheet for 420 nm (blue)
and can vary for up to a factor of two for other wavelengths.
Because of this, and since no calibration source for radiant
intensity was available, the resulting absolute values should
only be seen as estimates. Figure 2 shows as an example
the measured light output of the blue phosphor as well as
the video input signal.
For further theoretical analysis as well as for optimizing
the processing of signals for best readability, it is helpful to
have a simple closed-form approximation of the phosphor
impulse response. I manually adjusted the coefﬁcients and
number of terms in a sum of several exponential and power-
law decay functions until the convolution of the resulting
function with the video signal closely ﬁtted the recorded
photosensor output on a number of linear, logarithmic and
double-logarithmic plots. This semi-manual ﬁtting process

After convolution with the 1 V video signal according
to (3) and a delay of 29 ns (transmission times in electron
tubes and signal cables), these impulse response functions
lead to the excellently matching dashed lines in Fig. 2.
All three phosphors show a very noticeable relative drop
of radiant intensity in the ﬁrst tenth of a microsecond. Fig-
ure 3 shows that of all three phosphors, the blue one has
with −1500 W/(V·s·sr) by far the largest drop in absolute
intensity in the ﬁrst 100 ns and therefore will provide the
strongest high-frequency signal, while the red phosphor has

with −34 W/(V · s · sr) the smallest absolute drop.
The Fourier transforms of the impulse response curves in
Fig. 5 show that the blue phosphor applies to the video sig-
nal a low-pass ﬁlter in which for example a 10 MHz compo-
nent is less than 40 dB more attenuated than a 1 kHz signal.
Only for frequencies above around 5–10 MHz, the phos-
phors show the continuous 20 dB per decade roll-off typical
for a ﬁrst order low-pass ﬁlter.
Figure 4 shows as continuous lines the impulse response
curves on a logarithmic time scale. Their amplitudes have
been normalized to P (0) = 1 in this representation in or-
der to make the curve forms more comparable. The dashed
lines represent the integrals of the decay functions and show
which fraction of the totally emitted energy after stimula-
tion ceased has already been given off at any point in time.
The red phosphor, which decays purely exponentially,
emits practically all of its stored energy within 1–2 ms, but
it still has not lost a signiﬁcant part of its energy within the
ﬁrst 10 µs. The blue and green phosphors show a far more
heavy-tailed behavior, thanks to the power-law component
in their impulse response. Even long after the stimulus, they
still have not emitted all of their stored energy and as a re-
sult, even an unaided human observer with fully adapted
scotopic vision can notice an afterglow on a CRT screen in
an otherwise completely dark room for several minutes.
It might be worth noting that the integral of PP22G(t)
shows even hours after the excitation some unreleased en-
ergy in this phosphor type. Although this measurement was
not designed to estimate the here signiﬁcant parameter β

in (6) with good accuracy, this observation still leads to the
question whether CRT phosphors could leak conﬁdential in-
formation not only via instantaneous compromising emana-
tion, but also via data remanence.
5. Optical eavesdropping demonstration
Perhaps more interesting than a theoretical discussion of
phosphor decay frequency characteristics is a visually con-
vincing actual reconstruction of a displayed image from an
out-of-sight CRT surface.
In the following experiment, the same monitor (Dell
D1025HE) faces a white ofﬁce wall at around a meter dis-
tance. The photomultiplier is now located behind the mon-
itor, facing the same wall at around 1.5 m distance. There
is no direct line of sight between the sensor and the screen
surface.
As the wall illuminated by the monitor covers a large
solid angle as seen from the photosensor, no additional op-
tical elements such as a focusing lens are needed in this
demonstration. The experiment was performed at night with
the room lights switched off, however the room was far
from completely dark, being illuminated by several com-
puter displays and stray light from outside lamps.
Figure 6 shows a simple readability test chart with text
in various sizes, which the monitor displayed as the tar-
get video signal during the test. This test image was dis-
played in the same video mode as before (VESA 640 ×
480@85Hz). The text is in full white on black, and ad-
ditional test letters show all full intensity combinations of
the three phosphor colors. The oscilloscope averaged 256
frames (or equivalently 3 s of signal) at a sampling fre-
quency of 250 MHz. (These exact parameters are not crit-
ical and quite acceptable readability of small text can also
be achieved with lower sampling rates and numbers of av-
eraged frames as well as higher video modes.)
Figure 7 shows the recorded and averaged photocurrent
as a gray-scale image, much like a monitor driven with ap-
propriate sync pulses would present it. The largest font sizes
are readable, though the slow decay smears the luminos-
ity of each white pixel along the path of the electron beam
across the rest of the line and further. The gray values of
all the rastered signals shown here were adjusted such that
the values of the 0.1% highest and 0.1% lowest pixels in a
histogram are all mapped to full white or full dark respec-
tively, and the remaining values are linearly mapped to the
corresponding points on a gray scale.
The raw photomultiplier current in Fig. 7 clearly has to
be processed further in order to make text readable. Ana-
log preprocessing has the advantage that it can improve sig-
niﬁcantly the signal-to-noise ratio before any ampliﬁcation
and quantization steps limit the dynamic range of the sig-
