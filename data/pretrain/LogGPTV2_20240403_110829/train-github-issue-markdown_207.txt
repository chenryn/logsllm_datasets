If I run VSCode as **root** from bash on Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Lubuntu/Kubuntu it
doesn't respond on startup.  
This problem occurred on fresh installs, in VMs, on both of my devices.  
However running a quick `chown -R root:root /` fixed the problem (It is a
local VM, so whatever).  
[Disclaimer: Know what you do, do not copy paste that into your terminal]
Anyone else experienced the same on a Ubuntu based distro lately? On
Debian/Arch it works just fine.
BTW: I couldn't install the omnisharp plugin for Atom because of the exact
same reason.
