When I attempt to launch Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with **root** privileges from the bash terminal on Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, or Kubuntu, the application fails to respond upon startup. This issue has been observed on fresh installations, both on physical machines and in virtual environments, across two different devices.

Interestingly, executing `chown -R root:root /` resolved the problem. However, please exercise extreme caution with this command, as it changes the ownership of all files and directories to the root user, which can have significant security implications. This solution was tested in a local virtual machine, where such drastic measures are less risky.

Has anyone else encountered similar issues on an Ubuntu-based distribution recently? It's worth noting that VSCode runs without any problems on Debian and Arch Linux.

Additionally, I faced the same challenge when trying to install the OmniSharp plugin for Atom, suggesting that the problem might be related to running these applications with elevated permissions.
