Bug:  
If you click a bit quickly and sequentially group items #2 and #3, they both
open. (should not occur). same thing can happen with any two groups, if cliked
a bit more quick than normal speed, while browsing.
Feature Request:  
Options variable: force one group item to be always visible, so that the user
will not hide all groups together on a static layout page.
