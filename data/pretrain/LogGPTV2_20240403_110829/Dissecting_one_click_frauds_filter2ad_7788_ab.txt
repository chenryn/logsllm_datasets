respective proportion of frauds they host. Numbers are ob-
tained out of the 389 fraudulent domains for which WHOIS
information was accessible.
4.1 Infrastructural loopholes
We start by checking our data corpus for evidence of repeating
patterns in the attributes we collected. The idea is that, depar-
tures from usual patterns may indicate evidence of vulnerabilities
in the infrastructure. If, for instance, a disproportionate number of
frauds uses bank accounts at Bank X, one can reasonably infer that
Bank X processes for identity veriﬁcation and account establish-
ment are ﬂawed.
We ﬁrst consider the phone numbers used by fraudsters. We are
able to identify the phone number used for callback in 516 separate
incidents. We check the phone numbers in our database against the
phone number ownership list published by the Japanese Ministry
of Internal Affairs and Communications. We ﬁnd that 38.6% of
the phone numbers used in One Click Frauds are au cellular lines,
23.3% are Softbank cellular lines, and 16.5% are local landlines for
the Tokyo area. A 2009 report about the Japanese cellular phone
market [34, pp. 78–79], tells us that au has about 25% of the market
share, while NTT Docomo represents about 50% of the market.
So, it appears that au cellular lines are signiﬁcantly targeted by
fraudsters. Whether this is due to lax registration practices, or to
easier access to compromised lines, is unclear. The large proportion
of Tokyo numbers may be explained not only by the amount of
population in that area, but also by the fact that most forwarding
services, which redirect all incoming calls to a different number
while preserving the anonymity of the callee, use Tokyo numbers.
Next, we identify the bank used in 803 separate incidents. We
observe that online banks tend to be slightly more represented in
these frauds than their actual market share should warrant. For ex-
ample, 116 frauds (14.44%) use the online Seven Bank. On the
other hand, this bank does not have as signiﬁcant a market share in
Japan [34, pp. 82–83]. eBank and JapanNet Bank are two other ex-
amples of online banks used at a notable level (around 3%) in One
Click Frauds, while holding only a small market share. A possible
explanation is that online banks do not require a physical inter-
action to let individuals open an account, and are thus potentially
more prone to abusive registrations.

Figure 2: Number of websites hosted by the resellers used in
more than one incident.
We observe even more interesting patterns, when we look at
DNS registrars and resellers that are abused by fraudsters. Table 3
compares the market share, as of Nov. 2009, of the top domain
name registrars [35] with the proportion of registrars used by do-
main names participating in One Click Frauds. We are able to iden-
tify the registrars used in 389 incidents. We note that ENom is ap-
parently much more victim of abuse than other top domain name
registrars. Likewise, Above and GMO Internet rank highly with
fraudsters, while not having signiﬁcant market share. This result
can indicate one of two possibilities: Either these registrars have
very lenient registration policies, or they entrust some of their do-
mains to resellers that are not perfectly scrupulous.
To ﬁnd out which domain name resellers are used, we examine
the DNS ﬁeld in the WHOIS record associated with the domain
used in each One Click Fraud. A large number of sites we investi-
gate have been taken down (particularly those obtained from 2006-
2007 sources). In some cases, though, the One Click Fraud sites
have been replaced by domain parking pages, and thus still have
valid WHOIS information, which may reveal information on the
reseller used. Another large number of sites use either their own
DNS server, or free DNS services like opendns.com, and are
thus discarded from analysis. We complement investigation of the
WHOIS DNS ﬁelds with a simple reverse DNS/DNS lookup script.
For instance: dig +short admovie69.com | xargs dig +short -x
yields ikero.dreamhost.com, which tells us the web hosting
service is dreamhost.com.
We eventually manage to identify the resellers in 97 incidents.
In Figure 2, we graph the number of at resellers that are used in
more than one incident. We note that, for our successful lookups,
a couple of resellers (maido3.com, value-domain.com, ...)
appear to be highly represented. They tend to be cheap resellers,
with lax, or absent registration checks.
Speciﬁcally, we investigated further maido3.com. We used
a disposable email address to request rental of a speciﬁc domain
name and server space. We used a fake name, address and phone
number, which could have been easily spotted, as the address was
that of a famous subway station. We received an immediate re-
sponse with invoicing details. A simple money transfer was all that
was needed; and this could be performed anonymously by using
cash at a convenience store. The reseller promised the site would
be up within 30 minutes of the payment being sent. No identity
checks were ever performed. In other words, this speciﬁc reseller
appeared to be easy to abuse for fraudulent activities. While we
have not attempted the same type of test with the other “popular”
resellers, we venture to guess that their registration processes are
likely easily abused as well.
4.2 Grouping miscreants
We next attempt to determine whether we can ﬁnd evidence of

paper, we qualify by “organized criminal activity” large scale oper-
ations involving many frauds, using a considerable number of bank
accounts and stolen or abused phone lines, and possibly coordi-
nating with other organizations to deploy malware or share stolen
information. We contrast such large scale operations with those
involving only a couple of sites.
Methodology. We deﬁne an undirected graph G = (V, E) as fol-
lows. We create a vertex v ∈ V for each domain name, bank
account number, or phone number our database contains. Then, we
connect vertices belonging to the same fraud with edges E. For
instance, if our database contains an entry for a fraud hosted on
example.com, with bank account number 1234567 and phone
number 080-1234-1234, we add (v1, v2, v3) = { example.com,
1234567, 080−1234−1234} to V , and three edges (e1, e2, e3) =
{v1 ↔ v2, v1 ↔ v3, v2 ↔ v3} to E. Note that, by building the
graph G in this fashion, two nodes of the same type (domain name,
bank account number, phone number) never link directly to each
other, but can be connected through an intermediary. For example,
two websites using the same phone number result in a connected
path between the three concerned nodes. One natural question is
why we chose not to link two different domain names pointing
to the same IP address. The reason is, that we realized that this
happened sometimes for sites that were markedly different, only
because they were co-hosted on the same machine by a common
reseller. In other words, both incidents shared the same web host-
ing provider, but were not related otherwise. We decided to err on
the side of caution, and not to consider identical IP addresses as a
strong indicator of identical ownership.
Parsing the entire database yields a graph with 1,341 nodes and
5,296 edges. We ﬁrst isolate 26 “singletons” representing con-
nected subgraphs containing at most three nodes, and at most one
domain name, one phone number and one bank account. These
singletons represent incidents that we cannot connect to any other
fraud. All “one-off” scams fall in this category. Excluding the 26
singletons, the whole graph G contains 105 connected subgraphs
(“clusters”), with sizes ranging from a couple of nodes and edges
to a large cluster containing 179 nodes (56 domains, 112 bank ac-
counts, 11 phone numbers), and 696 edges.
We plot the graph G in Fig. 3. While the speciﬁc domain names,
phone numbers, and bank account numbers are not readable at this
scale, we can clearly distinguish the connected subgraphs, which
