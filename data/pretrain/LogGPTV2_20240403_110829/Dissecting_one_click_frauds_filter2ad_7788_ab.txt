### 4.1 Infrastructural Loopholes

We begin by examining our data corpus for recurring patterns in the collected attributes. The underlying assumption is that deviations from typical patterns may indicate vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. For example, if a disproportionately high number of frauds involve bank accounts at Bank X, it is reasonable to infer that Bank X's identity verification and account establishment processes are flawed.

#### Phone Numbers
We identified the callback phone numbers used in 516 separate incidents. By cross-referencing these phone numbers with the ownership list published by the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, we found that:
- 38.6% of the phone numbers used in One Click Frauds are au cellular lines.
- 23.3% are Softbank cellular lines.
- 16.5% are local landlines in the Tokyo area.

According to a 2009 report on the Japanese cellular phone market [34, pp. 78–79], au has approximately 25% of the market share, while NTT Docomo represents about 50%. This suggests that au cellular lines are significantly more targeted by fraudsters. The reasons for this could be lax registration practices or easier access to compromised lines. The high proportion of Tokyo numbers may also be explained by the use of forwarding services, which maintain the anonymity of the callee, often using Tokyo-based numbers.

#### Banks
In 803 separate incidents, we identified the banks used in the frauds. We observed that online banks are slightly overrepresented in these frauds compared to their actual market share. For instance:
- 14.44% (116 frauds) use the online Seven Bank, which does not have a significant market share in Japan [34, pp. 82–83].
- eBank and JapanNet Bank, other online banks, are used in around 3% of One Click Frauds, despite having a small market share.

A possible explanation is that online banks do not require physical interaction for account opening, making them more susceptible to abusive registrations.

### DNS Registrars and Resellers

We observe even more interesting patterns when examining DNS registrars and resellers abused by fraudsters. Table 3 compares the market share of the top domain name registrars as of November 2009 [35] with the proportion of registrars used in One Click Frauds. We identified the registrars used in 389 incidents and noted that ENom is apparently much more victimized by abuse than other top domain name registrars. Similarly, Above and GMO Internet rank highly among fraudsters, despite not having significant market share. This could indicate either very lenient registration policies or the entrustment of domains to less scrupulous resellers.

To identify the resellers, we examined the DNS field in the WHOIS records associated with the domains used in each One Click Fraud. Many sites had been taken down, especially those from 2006-2007. In some cases, the One Click Fraud sites were replaced by domain parking pages, still providing valid WHOIS information. We complemented our investigation with a reverse DNS/DNS lookup script. For example, `dig +short admovie69.com | xargs dig +short -x` yields `ikero.dreamhost.com`, indicating the web hosting service is `dreamhost.com`.

We managed to identify the resellers in 97 incidents. Figure 2 shows the number of resellers used in more than one incident. A few resellers, such as `maido3.com` and `value-domain.com`, are highly represented. These tend to be cheap resellers with lax or absent registration checks.

Specifically, we investigated `maido3.com`. Using a disposable email address, we requested rental of a specific domain name and server space with a fake name, address, and phone number. We received an immediate response with invoicing details, requiring only a simple money transfer, which could be performed anonymously. No identity checks were performed, suggesting that this reseller is easy to abuse for fraudulent activities. While we did not test other "popular" resellers, we hypothesize that their registration processes are likely similarly vulnerable.

### 4.2 Grouping Miscreants

Next, we attempt to determine whether there is evidence of organized criminal activities through miscreant behavior. In this paper, we define "organized criminal activity" as large-scale operations involving many frauds, numerous bank accounts, and stolen or abused phone lines, possibly coordinating with other organizations to deploy malware or share stolen information. We contrast such large-scale operations with those involving only a few sites.

#### Methodology
We define an undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \) as follows:
- We create a vertex \( v \in V \) for each domain name, bank account number, or phone number in our database.
- We connect vertices belonging to the same fraud with edges \( E \). For example, if our database contains an entry for a fraud hosted on `example.com` with bank account number `1234567` and phone number `080-1234-1234`, we add \( (v1, v2, v3) = \{ \text{example.com}, 1234567, 080-1234-1234 \} \) to \( V \), and three edges \( (e1, e2, e3) = \{ v1 \leftrightarrow v2, v1 \leftrightarrow v3, v2 \leftrightarrow v3 \} \) to \( E \).

By building the graph \( G \) in this manner, two nodes of the same type (domain name, bank account number, phone number) never link directly but can be connected through an intermediary. For example, two websites using the same phone number result in a connected path between the three concerned nodes. We chose not to link different domain names pointing to the same IP address because this sometimes occurs for co-hosted sites that are otherwise unrelated.

Parsing the entire database yields a graph with 1,341 nodes and 5,296 edges. We isolated 26 "singletons" representing connected subgraphs containing at most three nodes, and at most one domain name, one phone number, and one bank account. These singletons represent incidents that cannot be connected to any other fraud. Excluding the 26 singletons, the whole graph \( G \) contains 105 connected subgraphs ("clusters"), with sizes ranging from a few nodes and edges to a large cluster containing 179 nodes (56 domains, 112 bank accounts, 11 phone numbers), and 696 edges.

Figure 3 illustrates the graph \( G \). While specific domain names, phone numbers, and bank account numbers are not readable at this scale, the connected subgraphs are clearly distinguishable.
