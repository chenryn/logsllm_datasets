## Abstract
The World Wide Web, the largest distributed system ever built, has experienced tremendous growth in terms of websites, users, and technology. Accurate characterization of web workloads is fundamental for performance analysis, capacity planning, and admission control. This paper presents a detailed and rigorous statistical analysis of both request and session-level characteristics of web workloads using empirical data from four web servers. Our analysis focuses on phenomena such as self-similarity, long-range dependence, and heavy-tailed distributions. Identifying these phenomena in real data is challenging due to the potential for existing methods to produce misleading results. We provide a more accurate analysis of long-range dependence by removing trends and periodicity. Additionally, we study several intra-session characteristics using multiple methods to test for heavy-tailed behavior and cross-validate the results. Finally, we highlight specific problems associated with the methods used to establish long-range dependence and heavy-tailed behavior in web workloads. The comprehensive model presented in this paper is a step towards solving the web workload puzzle.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing availability of Internet access has led to a significant rise in the use of the World Wide Web, making it the largest distributed system ever built. Users now expect 24/7 availability and response times within seconds. Given the rapid growth and change in websites, users, and technology, a comprehensive analysis and prediction of web quality attributes are essential.

Understanding the nature and characteristics of web workloads is crucial for the proper design, implementation, and tuning of web-based systems, leading to improved quality of service. Over the past decade, considerable research has focused on studying network traffic, particularly web traffic. Pioneering work by Leland, Taqqu, Willinger, and Wilson [18] established that Ethernet LAN traffic is self-similar, with the degree of self-similarity increasing with traffic intensity. Subsequent studies, such as [22], proposed models for TELNET traffic (FULL-TEL) using Poisson connection arrivals, log-normal connection sizes, and Tcplib packet inter-arrivals. Another study [28] suggested that the superposition of many ON/OFF sources with heavy-tailed ON and OFF periods produces aggregate network traffic that is self-similar or long-range dependent.

Request-level analysis of web traffic in [7] showed that the busiest hours exhibit self-similar characteristics, while less busy hours do not. Another study [2] based on six web servers' logs found that file size and transfer size distributions are heavy-tailed.

A unique characteristic of web workloads is the concept of a session, defined as a sequence of requests from the same user during a single visit, with session boundaries delimited by periods of inactivity. Studies such as [5] and [3] have explored session-based admission control and other session characteristics. The work in [19] used Customer Behavior Model Graphs (CBMG) to represent web sessions, and subsequent work [20] proposed priority-based resource management policies. [21] studied the request, function, and session characteristics of two weeks of data from two e-commerce sites.

Recent studies [13, 15, 16] have raised questions about the methods used to establish self-similarity, long-range dependence, and heavy-tailed distributions. These studies show that existing methods can produce conflicting results, and factors like trend, periodicity, and noise can affect the accuracy and consistency of estimations.

In our earlier work [11, 12], we introduced several inter-session and intra-session characteristics to describe web workloads. In this paper, we present a more detailed and rigorous statistical analysis of web workloads based on empirical data from four web servers. Our goal is to build a FULL-Web model similar to the FULL-TEL model for TELNET traffic. Specifically, we analyze:

- **Request-based analysis**: Number of requests per unit of time and request inter-arrival time.
- **Session-based analysis**:
  - **Inter-session characteristics**: Sessions initiated per unit of time and time between sessions.
  - **Intra-session characteristics**: Session length in time, number of requests per session, and number of bytes transferred per session.

Our analysis focuses on exploring self-similarity, long-range dependence, and heavy-tailed distributions. To address the challenges in identifying these phenomena, we:
- Test the stationarity of request and session-based time series and remove trends and periodicity.
- Use multiple methods to estimate the Hurst exponent.
- Use different methods to test for heavy-tailed behavior and cross-validate the results.
- Highlight specific problems with methods used to establish long-range dependence and heavy-tailed behavior.

Previous research has focused only on request-level analysis or limited, non-rigorous analysis of session characteristics. We believe our comprehensive model contributes to a better understanding and more formal statistical description of web workloads, which is essential for performance modeling, capacity planning, and admission control.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data extraction and analysis process, Section 3 provides background on self-similarity, long-range dependence, and heavy-tailed distributions, Sections 4 and 5 present the analysis of web workloads at the request and session levels, respectively, and Section 6 offers concluding remarks.

## 2. Data Extraction and Analysis Process
The web logs used in this paper were obtained from four web servers: 
- University-wide web server at West Virginia University (WVU)
- Web server of the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (CSEE)
- Web server of the commercial Internet provider ClarkNet
- Web server at the NASA Independent Verification and Validation Facility (NASA-Pub2)

For practical reasons, we define a session as a sequence of requests issued from the same IP address with the time between requests less than a threshold value. Each unique IP address in the access log is considered a distinct user, although this may not always be true [3]. Despite inaccuracies, using the IP address provides a reasonable approximation of the number of distinct users. Based on the study of the effect of different threshold values on the total number of sessions [12], we adopt a 30-minute time interval as the threshold value.

The data collection and analysis process is summarized in Figure 1. After merging the access and error logs for architectures that employ redundant web servers (i.e., WVU and CSEE), we include the log entries in corresponding database tables, allowing for more flexible and customized analysis. In our earlier work [11, 12], we presented detailed error and reliability analysis and introduced several intra-session and inter-session attributes. In this paper, we provide a more detailed and statistically rigorous analysis of both request-based and session-based workload characteristics.

Table 1 summarizes the raw data for one week period for the web servers analyzed in this paper. The workload on different servers varies by three orders of magnitude, and the servers are from different domains: two from educational institutions, one from a research institution, and one from a commercial website. In addition to the one-week analysis, we aim to study the effect of workload intensity on request-based and session-based characteristics. For this purpose, we divided the one-week period into 42 intervals of 4 hours and selected typical low (Low), medium (Med), and high (High) intervals using the total number of requests as a criterion. Although we select intervals based on the total number of requests, the total number of sessions and bytes transferred within these intervals follow the same trend.

## 3. Background on Self-Similarity, Long-Range Dependence, and Heavy-Tailed Distributions
### Self-Similarity and Long-Range Dependence
Self-similarity in time series is characterized by the Hurst exponent \(H\). If \(H > 0.5\), the time series exhibits long-range dependence, meaning that the autocorrelation function decays slowly. Calculating the Hurst exponent is challenging due to the following reasons [13, 16]:
1. It can only be estimated, not calculated definitively.
2. No estimator is robust in every case, and it is unclear which estimator provides the most accurate estimation.
3. Long-range dependence may exist even if estimators have different estimates, provided the estimates show \(H > 0.5\).

### Heavy-Tailed Distributions
A distribution is heavy-tailed if its tail is not exponentially bounded. Formally, a random variable \(X\) is heavy-tailed if its complementary cumulative distribution function \(\bar{F}(x) = P[X > x]\) is regularly varying, i.e., \(\bar{F}(x) = x^{-\alpha}L(x)\) where \(L(x)\) is slowly varying as \(x \to \infty\). The simplest heavy-tailed distribution is the Pareto distribution, which has the cumulative distribution function \(F(x) = 1 - (k/x)^\alpha\).

Heavy-tailed distributions have an important property regarding their moments. If \(X\) is heavy-tailed with parameter \(\alpha\), then its first \(m\) moments are finite if and only if \(\alpha > m\). To identify heavy-tailed behavior, we plot the complementary cumulative distribution function \(\bar{F}(x)\) on log-log axes. Heavy-tailed distributions appear linear on such plots, and the slope of the line is \(-\alpha\).

## 5. Analysis of Web Workloads at the Session Level
[Detailed analysis of session-level characteristics, including inter-session and intra-session attributes, with figures and tables as appropriate.]

## 6. Concluding Remarks
This paper presents a comprehensive and rigorous statistical analysis of web workloads at both the request and session levels. By focusing on phenomena such as self-similarity, long-range dependence, and heavy-tailed distributions, we provide a more accurate and detailed understanding of web workloads. Our analysis highlights the challenges in identifying these phenomena and offers a more reliable approach to estimating the Hurst exponent and testing for heavy-tailed behavior. We believe that our comprehensive model is a significant step towards solving the web workload puzzle and will be valuable for performance modeling, capacity planning, and admission control.
