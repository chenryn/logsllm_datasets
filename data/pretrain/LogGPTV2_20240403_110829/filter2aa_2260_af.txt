The Phoenix UA incorporated existing policies and procedures (e.g., 800 megahertz [MHz] shared system 
SOPs and mutual aid channels SOPs as well as those developed as part of the DoJ 25 Cities Project) into the 
TICP, providing a solid basis for implementing the SOPs across the area.  These policies and procedures 
have been actively disseminated since the TICP completion (e.g., distributed to all included organizations, 
distributed at TICP Implementation Workshop).  The UA has scheduled upcoming technician and 
Communications Unit Leader (COML) training during which SOPs will be taught.  The National Incident 
Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) has been in place for less than 1 year, which 
implies that the UA is still in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  Despite 
the short period of time in which NIMS/ICS procedures have been in place, with few exceptions (e.g., 
unified command designation was not formally communicated), they were successfully demonstrated during 
the TICP validation exercise (e.g., two COMLs were identified and announced to all exercise participants). 
Recommendation: 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Phoenix shared system is used daily, and the UA tests its gateways three times each day to ensure 
familiarity with their use.  The TICP validation exercise successfully demonstrated the use of various types 
of equipment (e.g., radio caches, gateways), and minor software glitches in the use of a mobile gateway were 
quickly resolved.  The UA’s use of a laminated card with a list of talk groups and radio operating instructions 
is commendable, and should be considered a best practice.  Despite these demonstrated successes, the TICP 
validation exercise was limited to local, regional, and minimal state participants.  Assessing the degree to 
which the local agencies in the UA can easily use interoperable communications equipment with state and 
federal agencies was therefore not possible.  While the exercise met the stated requirements, the area is 
encouraged to build on its success by further integrating state, federal, tribal, and support agencies in future 
tests.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Involve private, state, federal, and tribal agencies in training and exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component in all future exercises

The Phoenix UA includes 800 MHz trunked systems and several very high frequency (VHF) conventional channels.  
The Phoenix/Mesa system was one of the first trunked radio systems in the country to meet the Project 25 (P25) 
standards.  To provide interoperability between 800 MHz and VHF users, console patches and several mobile and fixed 
gateways are available.  Currently, the City of Glendale is exploring the possibility of migrating onto the area's P25 
system.

FINThe newly combined Orange County Urban Area (UA) includes the core cities of Anaheim and Santa 
Ana, 32 other Orange County cities, 2 state universities and the County of Orange.   
Governance: Advanced Implementation  
The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) was created under the authority of the Orange 
County Operational Area; previously established committees (e.g., 800 megahertz [MHz] Governance 
Committee, 800 MHz Technical Liaison Committee, Orange County Chiefs of Police and Sheriff’s 
Association, Orange County Fire Chief’s Association) are responsible for key decisions and 
recommendations relative to policy, training, exercises, compliance, establishment of special committees, 
and operational issues within the UA.  The governance structure developed by the Orange County UA can 
serve as a model for other jurisdictions based on its breadth of local and state participation, frequency of 
meetings and reviews, and ability to address near-term needs and long-term interoperability goals.  As 
documented in Section 2 of its TICP, there is a clear authority flow for interoperable communications 
decisions, which is inclusive of all local first responder organizations.  The UA has proactively included 
multiple state and federal agencies in its interoperability solution through its Countywide Coordinated 
Communication System; however, the extent of the governance group’s formal interaction with federal 
agencies is not stated.  Additionally, the Orange County UA has a regional interoperability strategic plan in 
place that has been accepted by all participating agencies, is reviewed annually, and can address funding if 
future interoperability enhancements are required.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to seek formalized participation from and coordination with state and federal agencies in 
governance bodies 
• 
Continue to review and regularly update agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) to ensure 
appropriate agency participation 
• 
Continue to identify long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources to support interoperable 
communications

The policies for use of the Orange County shared system are long established and were effectively 
documented in Section 3 of the TICP.  SOPs have been disseminated to all included agencies and dispatch 
centers, and distributed through the TICP Implementation Workshop.  The use of these system SOPs was 
well demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise.  The exercise did show the need for further 
development of gateway SOPs.  The UA indicated that it has been in the process of implementing the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for less than one year, 
which implies that the UA is in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  
During the TICP validation exercise, participants demonstrated familiarity with NIMS/ICS processes (e.g.,

created, plain language not used).  However, as stated in the post-exercise Improvement Plan, the UA is 
actively pursuing improvements in the Communications Unit Leader functions pending further development 
of the criteria for this position.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Further develop SOPs for the use of gateways 
• 
Continue regularly exercising SOPs that test various scenario-based command and control procedures

The Orange County UA regularly conducts multi-agency responses using its shared system.  The TICP 
validation exercise participants were able to successfully establish interoperable communications (e.g., 
shared systems were used effectively, dispatch maintained fully interoperable communications with all first 
responders).  Despite demonstrated successes and although the TICP validation exercise met set standards, 
broader state and federal agencies were not widely included.  Assessing the degree to which the local 
agencies in the UA can easily use interoperable communications equipment with state and federal agencies 
was therefore limited.  The UA is encouraged to build on its success by further integrating state, federal, and 
support agencies in future tests.  Further demonstrating fluency and familiarity with interoperable 
communications solutions connecting local agencies with state and federal agencies would follow through on 
the recommendation in the post-exercise Improvement Plan that states that “Now that excellence with intra-
county communications has been demonstrated, exercise and evaluate communications links with agencies 
from state, federal, and outlying jurisdictions on other radio systems.” 
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider expanding exercises to integrate state and federal entities  
• 
Continue to expand and/or document additional methods to interoperate with state and federal agencies 
in the UA (e.g., Naval Weapons Station) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Anaheim and Santa Ana, California public safety communications are supported by the Orange County’s 800 MHz 
mixed-mode trunked radio system.  All public safety agencies in the Orange County UA have talk groups on this 
system, which includes 81 channels with 400 talk groups and 16,000 radios.  Given that the current radio system in 
Orange County provides for the highest possible level of interoperability (shared system), the next step would be to 
upgrade to a countywide Project 25 system.

Governance organizations for regional communications in the LA/LB UA have supported the 
implementation of regional communications interoperability equipment and infrastructure in recent years.  
The LA/LB UA Working Group developed the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) as one 
of its first combined efforts.  The LA/LB UA has demonstrated leadership through a history of successful 
cooperation in building and funding shared communications systems and interoperability solutions across the 
area.  Published and active agreements in the LA/LB UA effectively facilitate communications 
interoperability among all regional first responder agencies.  Although the UA is not yet, in its entirety, 
involved in strategic planning for communications interoperability goals, the UA leadership is actively 
planning new solutions (e.g., Project 25 [P25] system) that will expand the interoperable communications 
capabilities to other parts of the area.  Despite the good cooperation in the area, jurisdictions perform 
budgeting individually (with the exception of grants), and there is no specific regionwide plan for long-term 
communications interoperability funding.  There is also no single, well-established governance body or 
decision-making group that actively seeks out input from all the LA/LB UA public safety organizations. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Work to form one governance body that has formal authority over the newly formed combined UA, 
which should include input beyond county and local first responder organizations.  This governance 
body should include state agencies, such as California Department of Transportation, California 
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and the California Highway Patrol (CHP), other 
transportation agencies, utilities, and appropriate federal agencies 
• 
Continue to document and adopt a regional strategic planning process beyond the operational focus of 
the TICP 
• 
Continue to establish a regional interoperability funding strategy to include long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) 
funding sources

of the SOPs, which are compliant with the National Incident Management System (NIMS), into first 
responder practices and procedures.  For example, during the TICP validation exercise, the incident 
command structure was established and properly communicated to all participants.  Additional steps, such as 
including a procedure in the TICP for the proper designation and announcement of the Communications Unit 
Leader during an incident, would support the continued implementation of NIMS/Incident Command System 
(ICS).

The LA/LB UA first responders regularly and successfully use multiple types of interoperability equipment 
(e.g., shared channels, shared systems).  While gateways are only needed on a monthly basis for real-world 
use, LA/LB officials indicated that they are tested two times a week to ensure familiarity with their use.  The 
area showed proficiency in the use of all applicable equipment during their TICP exercise.  For example, 
shared marine channels and the Long Beach shared system were effectively used during the TICP validation 
exercise and seven gateways were tested to show the extent of their capabilities.  Additionally, state and 
federal agencies were included in the exercise to demonstrate the breadth of user familiarity on 
interoperability equipment across all levels of government. 
Recommendation:

The LA/LB UA is served by a number of radio systems operating in various public safety frequency bands.  Systems 
available include a countywide 800 megahertz system, an ultra high frequency (UHF) system operating in the public 
safety UHF and UHF-Television bands, a very high frequency (VHF) high-band system, and a VHF low-band system.    
The cities of Burbank, Culver City, and Glendale share a UHF, digital, Motorola SmartZone™ system, known as the 
Interagency Communications Interoperability System.  The City of Long Beach also operates shared VHF and UHF 
systems for various departments within the city, including the Police, Fire, Public Works, and Health and Human 
Services departments.  In addition to these shared systems, interoperability is available through the use of shared 
channels, radio caches, and gateways.  The fixed gateway is located and managed at the Sheriff’s Communications 
Center (SCC) in Los Angeles.  The CHP and the City of Long Beach have console patching capabilities.  Additionally, 
there are nine mobile gateways available in the area.  The LA Regional Tactical Communications System (LARTCS), 
located at and managed by the SCC, is the major fixed gateway serving the area.  LARTCS plans to design and procure 
an expanded multiband mutual aid communications system that provides coverage throughout Los Angeles County, 
including the surrounding national forests. 
The Regional Interoperability Steering Committee is planning the construction of a shared P25 UHF trunked radio 
system covering the UA.  The implementation of a shared UHF P25-compliant system would allow the use of multiple 
vendors.
