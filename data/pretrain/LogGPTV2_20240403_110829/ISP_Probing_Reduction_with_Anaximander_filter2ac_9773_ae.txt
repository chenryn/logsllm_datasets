Anaximander will simply jump to the next AS and continue probing, as the
AS marginal utility has become null. Of course, during the actual probing, it
is impossible to know whether we are truly encountering the ﬁnal plateau indi-
cating the end of the discovery, or if additional elements will still be discovered
afterwards. On the one hand, if we jump too soon to the next AS, we risk to

skip some traceroutes that would have discovered new elements. But on the
other hand, if we jump too late, we waste the probing budget for nothing.
We therefore introduce a simple threshold parameter, τ, that allows Anaxi-
mander to control the trade-oﬀ between maximizing the discovery and reducing
the probing budget. The threshold parameter τ belongs to the interval [0, 1] and
represents the length of the plateau (expressed as the proportion of the probed
AS address space) after which we jump to the next AS. In other terms, the lower
the parameter, the soonest we jump to the next AS. On one hand, when τ = 1,
it means Anaximander does not take into account the plateau and continues
probing even if nothing new is discovered for a group (e.g., preﬁxes belonging to
a neighbor AS). On the other hand, when τ = 0, Anaximander stops probing
the plateau as soon as a single probe is useless. We call the eﬀects of τ on probing
the Plateau Reduction (PR).
An example of the eﬀect of τ is given in Fig. 5. This ﬁgure presents a portion
of a (ﬁctitious and simpliﬁed) discovery curve during a probing campaign. The
two vertical red lines delimit the current AS being probed (for example, a direct
neighbor of the AS of interest, let us call it AS N ). The ﬁrst probe belonging to
AS N is pn and the last probe is pn + x − 1. The address space of AS N thus
contains x probes. If we select τ1 = 0.1 as the threshold parameter, it means we
will stop probing AS N after having encountered a plateau whose length is greater
than 10% of the AS’s address space. In this case, we thus stop at the ﬁrst vertical
blue line, i.e., at probe pn + t1. However, if we select τ2 = 0.2, we stop probing
after having encountered a plateau whose length is greater than 20% of the AS’s
address space. This corresponds to the second vertical blue line, at probe pn + t2.
In this scenario, we see that a threshold value of τ2 = 0.2 is more appropriate
because it allows us to discover all there is to discover, and to prune the remaining
of the plateau, thus reducing the probing budget. On the other hand, if we select
τ1 = 0.1, we will jump too soon to the next AS and possibly lose some information.
6 Evaluation
6.1 Methodology
To assess Anaximander eﬃciency, we simulate it on the TNT dataset (see
Sect. 3). More precisely, we replay measurements oﬄine in order to understand
460
E. Marechal et al.
what are the respective gains and losses of our probing reduction techniques.
Our comparison is thus relative and we consider the brute-force approach (prob-
ing of the entire Internet at a /24 granularity) as a baseline oﬀering an upper
bound on the probing coverage one cannot outperform by construction. While
this baseline provides the coverage upper-bound, it is not able to cover the whole
topology (for example, backup links are not visible if no failure occurs during
the campaign): our goal is to oﬀer the same coverage but with a reduced probing
budget.
In practice, we do not assume that the TNT dataset provides a complete
picture of the router-level topology of a given ISP. As a matter of fact, diﬀerent
VPs placements can lead to discovering diﬀerent portions of the AS. There could
even be some unlucky sets of VPs that provide very poor visibility for a speciﬁc
AS of interest (for example, if all VPs have a certain Tier 1 as their primary
provider while the goal of the study is to map another Tier 1).
However, such considerations are outside the scope of this work. It is not our
goal here to study VPs placement strategies. Rather, we designed Anaximander
to remain a ﬂexible tool that can be launched on any set of VPs, and that will
yield the best possible results given that set. This appears to us as the most
sensible approach for designing a probing tool, given the diﬃculty of obtaining
VPs to launch a campaign (and the even greater diﬃculty of placing VPs in
strategic locations that would suit the speciﬁc purpose of said campaign).
In short, if the initial set of VPs provides very poor visibility into the AS
of interest, the resulting maps will obviously not oﬀer high quality absolute
coverage. But this is independent of the probing strategies employed (and of
Anaximander, de facto), and the maps would not have been any more complete
with a brute force approach (or with any other probing strategy). This evaluation
argues that Anaximander is able to recover (almost) the same ISP maps as
obtained with a brute force approach, but with a much more eﬃcient probing
methodology.
For our evaluations to be relevant nonetheless, we selected 25 ASes (see
Table 1) for which we attained good coverage in terms of IP interfaces, links,
and routers, given the set of VPs of the TNT dataset. We chose ASes with varying
sizes and roles in the Internet (11 Tiers 1, 5 Transits, and 9 Stubs) in order to
be the most representative. We evaluate our strategies based on two metrics:
the percentage of discovery (i.e., completeness) compared to the complete AS
map in the TNT dataset11; and the number of traceroutes sent (i.e., probing
reduction) compared to the initial pool where no reduction is applied.
6.2 Results
We present in Fig. 6 the simulation results for all ASes and all reduction strate-
gies applied successively (ﬁrst BDP, then OR, then PR, as shown in Fig. 1). A
comparsion with Rocketfuel is also available. Fig. 6a, 6b, and 6c present the ﬁnal
ASes coverage (Y-axis) for addresses, routers, and links, respectively. A router is

As for Fig. 6d, it displays the corresponding reduction on the number of probes
sent, relative to initial pool where no reduction is applied (see “Initial Pool” label
on the X-axis).
Results are presented in the form of box plots in order to study the global
distribution of ASes’ coverage with each strategy. Additionally, each AS is repre-
sented by a colored dot (black for Tiers1, blue for Transits, and white for Stubs)
to visualize the diﬀerence in behaviors depending on the AS type.
Comparison with Rocketfuel. As a reminder, Rocketfuel’s initial pool of
targets is composed of the directed preﬁxes found in the RIBs, while Anaxi-
mander’s initial pool is composed, on the one hand, of the AS’s internal preﬁxes
(broken down into /24 preﬁxes); and on the other hand, of the raw directed pre-
ﬁxes. The ﬁrst observation we can make for Rocketfuel in Fig. 6a, 6b, and 6c is
that the ﬁnal discovery levels can vary quite dramatically depending on the AS
type, with values ranging from a few percents to a perfect 100%.
For Stub ASes, the global trend is to be situated in the lower part of the box
plots. We see the ﬁnal coverage can very often be quite low, with values that can
drop around 5% for both addresses and routers, and even to 0% for links. This is

and Apple.

actually not surprising given the edge position of the AS in the global network.
Such ASes generally appear only at the end of the AS_PATH attribute associated
to a unique preﬁx (internal to the AS) resulting so in very few probes launched
towards the AS of interest. For large Tiers 1 however, the ﬁnal coverage can
reach much higher values on average, that is 80% for addresses, 70% for links,
and around 87% for routers. For Transit ASes, we observe intermediate and
diverse discovery levels, with behaviors similar to Stub ASes for some but that
can also span the ones of a Tier 1, depending on the size and role of the Transit
AS in the global interconnection.
From these results, we can clearly see that Rocketfuel’s initial pool provides
quite unreliable coverage and is lacking a lot of targets in order to reconstruct
the complete ISP topology. This justiﬁes the need to expand Rocketfuel’s initial
pool with the /24 internal preﬁxes in order to complete our exploration. The
ﬁnal levels of discovery for Anaximander’s initial pool (enhanced with /24
internal preﬁxes) can be found under the label “Initial Pool” on the X-axis.
For addresses, routers, and links, we see the positive impact on ASes coverage
brought by the addition of the /24 internal preﬁxes. Indeed, the box plots are
much denser and higher than in the case of Rocketfuel, meaning that results are
consistently better. More precisely, Stubs now almost always present a perfect
coverage for addresses, routers, and links. For Tiers 1, the increase in coverage is
less impressive, although still present, with a smaller 10% absolute gain. Transit
ASes present once again an intermediate behavior between Stubs and Tiers 1.
These results are also coherent with those presented in Sect. 5.4, where we
showed that internal preﬁxes represent a great part of the AS discovery (or even
all discovery for Stubs). Adding the /24 internal preﬁxes naturally brought the
box plots up for all types of ASes.
Best Directed Preﬁxes (BDP) Reduction. Looking at Fig. 6a, 6b, and 6c
for addresses, link, and routers; we notice that the BDP Reduction had little
to zero impact on AS coverage. Indeed, the three box plots have been slightly
elongated downwards, but this is almost imperceptible (especially for routers
that are quite resistant to any reduction strategies).
If we now take a look at the reduction of probes allowed by BDP Reduction
(Fig. 6d), we see it already presents a great potential in reduction depending on
the type of the AS. The ﬁrst result is that, for Stub ASes, there is practically no
diﬀerence between the initial pool and the BDP Reduction, both in terms of probe
reduction and discovery, meaning that the reduction was ineﬀective. Indeed, we
can see across the four ﬁgures that all Stub ASes globally remain at their position
in the box plots. In fact, this is not surprising given that BDP Reduction is applied
to the directed preﬁxes in the pool and that their initial pool is composed mostly
of the AS’s internals preﬁxes (see Sect. 5.4 for a visualization of this). For this
reason, and anticipating on the next sections, none of the reduction techniques of
Anaximander will be eﬀective for Stub ASes. Given the already low number of
probes in the initial pool for Stubs, we do not consider it an issue and focus our
eﬀorts on reducing the probing budget for larger (transit) ASes.

On the other hand, for Transit and Tier 1 ASes, the eﬀect of the reduction
appears clearly with a substantial decrease of 30% on average in the probing
budget, without any loss in coverage. Moreover, for some Transits and Tiers 1,
BDP Reduction managed to decrease the probing budget by impressive values
of up to 90%. The diversity of BGP paths does seem to introduce signiﬁcant
redundancy, and targeting shortest sub-paths looks to be a good option across
multiple vantage points.
Overlay Reduction (OR). As already explained for the BDP Reduction, the
eﬀects of the strategy are invisible for Stub networks (we can see all Stub ASes
remain in their position in all of the box plots).
However, if we take a look at the impact of OR on Tier 1 and Transit net-
works, we observe, as expected, a probing reduction (more than 10%) without
any signiﬁcant loss in topology discovery (see Fig. 6a, 6b, and 6c).
Plateau Reduction (PR). Results for PR are presented for diﬀerent thresh-
old values (τ varying from 0.7 down to 0.1 by step of 0.1). Once again, and not
surprisingly, the eﬀects of the strategy are invisible for Stub ASes. For larger
ASes however, the impact is much more signiﬁcant. PR allows for an impor-
tant reduction of the number of probes with more or less decrease in coverage,
depending on the AS, the type of element (IP interface, router, or link), and the
threshold value.
Let us look in more details at the threshold impact on the levels of discovery.
For addresses and routers (Fig. 6a, 6b), we observe virtually no reduction in
AS coverage up until a threshold value of τ = 0.4, where the levels of discovery
start to very slowly decrease. The eﬀect of PR is a bit more detrimental for links
though, where we see a slightly more important decrease in coverage compared
to addresses and routers. Regarding the reduction on the number of probes
(Fig. 6d), we discern a very clear and steady reduction with each passing value
of τ. For τ = 0.4, we managed to reduce the probing budget by an average of
65% with no reduction whatsoever on coverage.
With these results, we can clearly observe the eﬀect of the diﬀerent values of
parameter τ on PR. Smaller values are able to greatly reduce the probing budget,
but naturally come at the cost of a decrease in AS coverage. It is up to the users
to select a particular threshold value τ that best suits their needs and contraints.
Intermediate threshold values might be a better option than the quite radical
τ = 0.1 value, as they present a reduction on the probing budget more than
acceptable (between 50% and 65%) while maintaining high topology discovery
levels. They can also pick a very conservative value (τ = 0.7, for example) that
does not decrease the topology discovery at all while still reducing the probing
budget of another 10–12%.
6.3 Global Comment
Globally, the general shapes of the box plots are very promising. For addresses
and routers in particular, the ASes’ coverage distribution remains very high and
464
E. Marechal et al.
dense across the various reduction strategies. For links, the coverage distribution
remains also rather constant, although it was more spread to start with. And
while the coverage remains high, the probing budget is greatly and steadily
reduced with each reduction strategy.
All in all, the various reduction strategies we designed are quite eﬀective
in reducing the probing budget while still maintaining high coverage. They are
also able to adapt themselves to the type of AS being mapped and thus provide
ﬂexible but consistent and reliable results across all types of AS.
7 Conclusion
Internet is a complex system made of numerous independent entities called ASes.
To understand its structure and characteristics, many attempts have been pro-
posed, developed, and deployed according to the scale and the purpose of the
study. In this work, we are interested in the extraction of speciﬁc AS router
level maps, with a reduced probing budget, and without hampering the result-
ing topological coverage. Given the diﬃculty of directing traceroutes towards
an AS of interest, as well as the fact that many traces lead to redundant paths,
the problem is challenging and predictions are not obvious.
To achieve this goal, we proposed Anaximander, a new eﬃcient approach
able to recover the same ISP maps as obtained with a brute force approach,
but with a network-friendly and eﬃcient probing methodology. For a given ISP
and a given set of vantage points, Anaximander will design the best list of
targets before actively probing the ISP. In addition, our tool also comes with
a simple parameter to control the trade-oﬀ between maximizing the ISP cover-
age and reducing the probing budget. Overall, Anaximander is a generic tool
