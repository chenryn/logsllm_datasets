### Data Sources and Updates

One of the data sources we use in our domain seed is a feed of potentially malicious domains provided by a security company. This feed includes domains that have been observed to engage in various forms of potentially harmful internet activity. As this feed continuously provides new domain names, we regularly update our existing list of interesting domains by appending the new information. The updated list is then pushed to our collection infrastructure daily. This feed adds tens of thousands of new domains each day, making it one of our fastest-growing lists.

Additionally, we incorporate a collection of public blacklists to enrich our dataset with hand-curated domains known for malicious activity. Specifically, the public blacklists we use include Abuse.ch, Malware DL, Blackhole DNS, sagadc, hphosts, SANS, and itmate. These lists are aggregated daily, and the old list is replaced with the updated one.

### Measurements

Thales has been collecting data for nearly six months. For the purposes of this paper, we will analyze all the data collected during this period, with a more detailed focus on the last 12 days of March (the last full week). Over the six-month period, Thales identified approximately 10,714,784 unique IP addresses, 199,110,841 unique domain names, and 662,319,389 unique resource records (RRs) per day. Figure 4 illustrates the average daily distribution of IP addresses, domain names, and RRs from October 5th, 2015, to March 3rd, 2016.

**Figure 4: Volumes of IPs, Resource Records, and Domains Observed with Thales**

- **March 7th, 2016**: We started querying for QTYPEs: SOA, AAAA, TXT, and MX.
- **Outages**:
  - **October 25, 2015**: Initial setup issue due to an incorrect update.
  - **January 23, 2016**: Campus data center maintenance for cooling infrastructure.
  - **December 6, 2015**: Hardware failure detected early in the morning, with recovery by the same afternoon.

During these outages, we implemented measures to mitigate future disruptions. Thales is now portable, allowing us to move it to another location with a day's notice. The partial outage on December 6, 2015, resulted in a significant dip in data collection, but some data was still gathered for that day.

### Comparing Active and Passive DNS Datasets

Passive DNS has been a valuable tool for combating malware, botnets, and malicious actors. However, passive DNS data is rare, difficult to obtain, and often comes with restrictive legal clauses. Additionally, laws and regulations against personal identifiable information (PII), the high financial cost of passive collection, and storage infrastructure make passive DNS cumbersome. The primary goal of the active DNS dataset is to reduce the barrier for repeatable security research on DNS.

In this section, we compare active and passive DNS datasets. While not a true replacement for passive DNS, Thales can generate active DNS datasets that, in many cases, contain an order of magnitude more domain names and IP addresses.

#### Datasets

Our passive DNS dataset consists of traffic collected at our university network, both below and above the recursive resolvers. For the comparison, we used datasets collected during the entire month of March 2016.

**Figures 5 and 6: Distribution of Records in Active and Passive DNS Datasets**

- **Active DNS Dataset**: Minimal fluctuations due to the stable nature of the domain name seed.
- **Passive DNS Dataset**: Fluctuations driven by user behavior, such as weekends, holidays, and exam periods. A notable increase in traffic occurred after spring break, as shown in Figure 6c.

### Case Studies

To demonstrate the security value of the active DNS datasets, we present several case studies. Our goal is not to claim any new abuse detection processes but to show the practical security benefits of active DNS data for the research and operational communities.
