User: I'll explain my question: is it possible to write a Python script which interacts with OS X architecture in a high-level way?
For example, can I gain control on Mac OS X windows resizing from a Python script? Are there modules for that? I'm not finding any.
To push things even further, would I be able to control keyboard shortcuts too? I mean, with Python, could I write a script that opens a terminal window everytime I type cmd + Enter from wherever I am in that moment, as if it was a system shortcut (Awesome WM style, if you know what I'm talking about)?
Hope I've been clear.
Assistant: The 2nd one you can't do for sure, since the events are grabbed by other processes.
You should look for a osx specific library for doing that and then write a python wrapper around it.
