### Version
2.5.7
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/3s9sem0m/
### Steps to reproduce
I am using laravel-admin.org and I have incorporated vuejs into that system.
The problem is that there are some functionalities that use the tag template,
to then duplicate it using jquery, and vuejs are rendering those tags (even if
you add the v-pre directive) and breaking all that functionality.
### What is expected?
The directive v-pre should prevent render the tag template
### What is actually happening?
The tag template is rendered and disappears, preventing the later use of the
js script and breaking all the functionality
