Hi!
I'm using TypeScript with named parameters massively like this.
    class User {
      public firstName: string;
      public lastName: string;
      constructor({firstName, lastName}: {firstName: string, lastName: string}) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
      }
    }
    new User({firstName: 'Foo', lastName: 'BAR'});
And I would love to be able to generate the properties automatically like
this.
    class User {
      constructor({public firstName, public lastName}: {firstName: string, lastName: string}) {}
    }
    new User({firstName: 'Foo', lastName: 'BAR'});
I think that this feature can be really interesting and would encourage more
developers to use named parameters which I think is one of the most important
best practices in TypeScript and any other language by the way.
Thank you in advance.
