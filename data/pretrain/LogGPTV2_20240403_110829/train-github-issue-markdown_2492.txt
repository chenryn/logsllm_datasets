@nikomatsakis and I agreed that it would be better to change the `ty::substs`
type to have the `tps` field be a map from node IDs to types, rather than a
vector of types as it is now. This allows ty params to be referred to based on
their node IDs rather than positionally as they are now. Among other things,
this addresses a bug in the code that I'm trying to isolate in which class ty
params get concatenated with method ty params and sometimes a param gets
duplicated. Niko said he would do this as a byproduct of rewriting the code
for self types.
