privacy of mobile subscribers.
A. Failure to Maintain Confidentiality of Identity
Even if the TMSI replaces the IMSI to hide a subscriber’s
identity, several studies have shown that an adversary can
still compromise the user’s privacy [9], [20], [30]. Attackers
exploit the problem whereby carriers do not change the TMSI
frequently enough to hide a subscriber’s identity. Given that the
TMSI is persistent even after a voice call in GSM, Kune et al.
suggested that an adversary can locate the subscriber [20]. They
made a silent call to generate a paging message from the base
station; the recipient is unaware of this call as it is concluded
before the phone rings. The adversary monitors the TMSIs in
the paging messages by listening to the paging channel (PCCH).
If the recipient of the call is attached to the same LA as the
adversary, he/she is among the TMSIs monitored in the paging
messages once the attacker makes the silent call. The attacker
calls several times to check whether the TMSI is monitored
at every silent call. Shaik et al. showed that the same attack
can be mounted in LTE because the GUTI is not allocated
often enough [30]. Myrto et al. also claimed that TMSIs are
not updated frequently [9]. As a solution to this vulnerability,
they suggested that carriers should reallocate a new temporary
identity to a subscriber more frequently. Broek et al. introduced
the Pseudo Mobile Subscriber Identifier (PMSI) to defend
against the IMSI catching attack; they replaced the IMSI with
changing pseudonyms based on SIM information, which were
called PMSI [42]. They also tried to keep the subscriber’s
identity confidential; however, they did not address a policy
of temporary identity reallocation. Furthermore, implementing
PMSIs require changing the SIM of all devices. While our
work focuses on privacy violations from poorly randomized
identifiers in cellular networks, other technologies (including
WiFi) are also affected by these issues [24].
B. Control Plane Analysis in Cellular Networks.
Lee et al. analyzed the impact of each control plane
procedure on the 3G core network [21]. Traynor et al. showed
how a large number of botnets could cause a signaling Denial
of Service (DoS) in a cellular network [38]. Arapinis et al.
introduced a method for tracking the user’s location through
Authentication Failure [8], and Golde et al. introduced a
method for hijacking a user’s session through a signaling race
condition [15]. Tu et al. considered the impact of CSFB calls
on network performance in several ways [39], [40], and Li et
al. introduced a signaling analysis tool applicable to mobile
devices [22].

In this study, along with the above-mentioned problems,
we demonstrate that carriers are still vulnerable to location
tracking even if they change the GUTI frequently. A key
requirement of GUTI is generating an unpredictable value
to hide the subscriber’s identity [5], [6]. We conclude that
current operators fail to offer this protection.
IV. GLOBAL MEASUREMENT OF IDENTITY MANAGEMENT
Cellular networks manage the confidentiality of subscribers’
identities by allocating a TMSI. As the TMSI is transmitted
through a paging channel and is exposed as plain text, the
network should refresh it frequently to prevent subscribers from
being identified. As mentioned above, this identity management
is operator-specific because the 3GPP standards do not specify
a detailed mechanism for it. In this section, we investigate
operational policies for identity management used by carriers
worldwide to check whether they securely manage subscribers’
identities. We analyze the large-scale dataset we collected to
determine whether the currently deployed GUTI allocation
logic is adequate to protect the confidentiality of subscribers.
A. Dataset
Table I shows a summary of the dataset we collected
and used in this paper. We gathered signaling messages 1
invoked during the CSFB/VoLTE call procedure to monitor the
GUTI value following its reallocation. The data was collected
during our visits to conferences and project meetings and
on our vacations. Our dataset consists of GUTI allocation
data for 39,268 voice calls managed by 28 carriers from 11
1Control-plane messages
countries by using 78 SIM cards during a period of 2 years 9
months (from Nov. 2014 to Jul. 2017). To specifically focus on
identity management, all data is recorded without any mobility.
We used a simple auto-call tool to automatically dial and
disconnect for efficient data collection. This tool can be called
and disconnected via a chipset-specific command or an Android
debug bridge command, and it is configured to specify the call
duration and idle time. Throughout the paper, we denote each
carrier by abbreviated symbols for the relevant country and a
roman numeral.
B. Methodology
To examine GUTI reallocation, we use the CSFB voice call.
On serving a CSFB call at the cellular network, the network
switches the UE to the target network system (3G) from the
previous network (LTE) and releases all resources belonging to
the latter. After serving the CSFB call, the UE proceeds with
the Attach request procedure, and the carrier reallocates
GUTI to the subscriber while proceeding with an Attach
request through the TAU procedure. As a result, our approach
of invoking a CSFB voice call provides an opportunity to test the
GUTI reallocation logic of the carriers. Note that for backward
compatibility, CSFB is used by many operators and in many
countries; therefore, our approach successfully provides hints
to examine the GUTI reallocation logic of all operators and
countries we investigated. In addition, both CSFB that we use
in this work and another method that invokes GUTI reallocation
could be used for inferring the reallocation logic.
We analyze the variation in GUTI values in the dataset (Sec-
tion IV-A) that recorded all GUTI values in TAU messages
by continuously generating CSFB calls. Among the various

GUTI components, we only focus on M-TMSI, that is, the last
four bytes of the GUTI. The remaining parts are the MMEC,
public land mobile network code (MCC and MNC), and MME
Group ID, which can be considered constant 2. We also ignore
MMEC because monitoring M-TMSI is enough to locate the
victim. Note that carriers that use the MME pool might change
the MMEC in GUTI reallocation. Even in this case, we noticed
that the M-TMSI pattern is not changed. As a result, once the
GUTI reallocation pattern is identified, a victim can be tracked
by using M-TMSI alone.
