### Privacy of Mobile Subscribers

#### A. Failure to Maintain Confidentiality of Identity

Even when the Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) replaces the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) to conceal a subscriber’s identity, several studies have shown that adversaries can still compromise user privacy [9], [20], [30]. One key issue is that carriers do not change the TMSI frequently enough. In GSM, the TMSI remains persistent even after a voice call, which Kune et al. [20] exploited to locate subscribers. They made silent calls to generate paging messages from the base station, which the recipient was unaware of because the call was concluded before the phone rang. By monitoring the TMSIs in these paging messages, an adversary can determine if the recipient is within the same Location Area (LA) as the attacker. Repeated silent calls can confirm the presence of the TMSI in the paging messages.

Shaik et al. [30] demonstrated that similar attacks can be mounted in LTE, where the Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity (GUTI) is not allocated often enough. Myrto et al. [9] also noted that TMSIs are not updated frequently. To mitigate this vulnerability, they suggested that carriers should reallocate a new temporary identity more frequently.

Broek et al. [42] introduced the Pseudo Mobile Subscriber Identifier (PMSI) to defend against IMSI catching attacks by replacing the IMSI with changing pseudonyms based on SIM information. While PMSIs aim to keep the subscriber’s identity confidential, they do not address the policy of frequent temporary identity reallocation. Additionally, implementing PMSIs requires changing the SIM cards of all devices. Our work focuses on privacy violations due to poorly randomized identifiers in cellular networks, but other technologies, including WiFi, are also affected by these issues [24].

#### B. Control Plane Analysis in Cellular Networks

Several researchers have analyzed the impact of control plane procedures on cellular networks. Lee et al. [21] examined the 3G core network, while Traynor et al. [38] showed how a large number of botnets could cause a signaling Denial of Service (DoS). Arapinis et al. [8] introduced a method for tracking users through Authentication Failures, and Golde et al. [15] described a method for hijacking user sessions via signaling race conditions. Tu et al. [39], [40] considered the impact of Circuit Switched Fallback (CSFB) calls on network performance, and Li et al. [22] introduced a signaling analysis tool for mobile devices.

#### IV. Global Measurement of Identity Management

Cellular networks manage the confidentiality of subscribers’ identities by allocating TMSIs. Since the TMSI is transmitted in plain text over the paging channel, it must be refreshed frequently to prevent identification. The 3GPP standards do not specify a detailed mechanism for this, making it operator-specific. This section investigates the operational policies for identity management used by carriers worldwide to determine if they securely manage subscribers’ identities.

##### A. Dataset

Table I summarizes the dataset collected for this study. We gathered signaling messages during CSFB/VoLTE call procedures to monitor GUTI values following reallocation. Data was collected during conferences, project meetings, and vacations. Our dataset includes GUTI allocation data for 39,268 voice calls managed by 28 carriers across 11 countries using 78 SIM cards over 2 years and 9 months (from Nov. 2014 to Jul. 2017). All data was recorded without any mobility, and we used an auto-call tool to automatically dial and disconnect calls. The tool is configured to specify call duration and idle time. Carriers are denoted by abbreviated symbols for their respective countries and a Roman numeral.

##### B. Methodology

To examine GUTI reallocation, we use CSFB voice calls. During a CSFB call, the network switches the User Equipment (UE) from LTE to 3G, releasing all LTE resources. After the call, the UE performs an Attach request procedure, and the carrier reallocates the GUTI through the Tracking Area Update (TAU) procedure. This approach provides an opportunity to test the GUTI reallocation logic of the carriers. For backward compatibility, many operators use CSFB, making our approach applicable to all operators and countries investigated.

We analyze the variation in GUTI values in the dataset, focusing on M-TMSI, the last four bytes of the GUTI. The remaining components (MMEC, MCC, MNC, and MME Group ID) are considered constant. Even in cases where the MMEC changes, the M-TMSI pattern remains consistent. Once the GUTI reallocation pattern is identified, a victim can be tracked using M-TMSI alone.

#### Table II: TMSI Allocation Pattern of Carriers

| Allocation Pattern | Operators |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Assigning the same GUTI | BE-III, DE-II, FR-II, JP-I |
| Three bytes fixed | CH-II, DE-III, NL-I, NL-II |
| Two bytes fixed | BE-II, CH-I, CH-III, ES-I, FR-I, NL-III |
| One byte fixed | AT-I, AT-II, AT-III, BE-I, DE-I |

In conclusion, current operators fail to provide adequate protection by generating unpredictable GUTI values, leaving subscribers vulnerable to location tracking.
