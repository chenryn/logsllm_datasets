Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-practice-functional-
programming has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include
links to screen shots if possible:
I appreciate what you're trying to do by referring people to this tutorial,
but it's not the greatest. In addition to not really providing detailed
explanations of the functions they're trying to teach, there seem to be bugs
in the answers provided at the site. For example, on exercise 20, when I click
"show answer" and then run the code they provide, it does not let me move
forward. I'm now stuck and can't complete this waypoint unless I do some
digging through the source, and I'm certain that's not what you're trying to
teach.
