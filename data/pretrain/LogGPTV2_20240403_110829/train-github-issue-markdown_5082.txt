## ðŸš€ Feature

As per @pritamdamania87's comment on issue #30020, there is currently duplicated code in the shutdown implementation across different RPC backends. To address this, we should consolidate the common shutdown logic into the `RpcAgent`'s `shutdown` function. Each backend can then implement a `shutdownImpl` method to handle any custom shutdown details specific to that backend.
