## ðŸš€ Feature
Per @pritamdamania87's comment on #30020, we can have duplicated code in the
shutdown implementation of different RPC backends. We should unify this code
in RpcAgent's shutdown function, and then each backend can have a
`shutdownImpl` for their custom shutdown implementation details.
