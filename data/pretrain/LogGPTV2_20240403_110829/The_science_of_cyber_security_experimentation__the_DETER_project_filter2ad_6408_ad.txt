### Methods for Constructing an Apparatus

To manage complexity and enhance the ease of construction, we are developing an apparatus framework centered on an abstraction we call a "container" [21]. In our new construction methodology, a container serves as the fundamental building block. A single container can support one or multiple components (elements) of an experimental apparatus and implements an abstraction layer that hides the details of the inner components when the container is placed inside another container.

**Figure 2: A Simple Container with Two Basic Computing Resources**

Abstraction is provided by the container's communication mechanism, which connects the contained elements and presents an entry/exit point for communication. The communication mechanism also advertises the properties of its container to other containers.

### Abstraction and Scalability in DeterLab

Abstraction is crucial for expanding the scalability options in DeterLab. Other researchers frequently develop new techniques for scalable computing, virtualization, simulation, or lightweight computation. Our goal is to incorporate promising work in this area by defining a new abstract type of basic computing element, creating a standard for a containerized component based on each new technology, and explicitly expressing its trade-offs for use in construction tools.

So far, our container-based approach has been successful in enhancing scalability for multi-resolution experiments and has met the requirements for integrating container technology into the ELM workbench. Ongoing work includes several areas:

#### Apparatus Construction
We have demonstrated feasible levels of scalability and complexity by creating several experimental apparatuses, the largest containing over 600 components realized on 8 physical computers, capable of representing 50,000 computers at a coarse granularity in a specific scenario. However, construction currently involves manually matching each element in a desired network topology with a specific container. Automating this process and integrating containers into the apparatus construction mechanism of ELM is a promising area for future work.

#### Reusability and Embedding
ELM allows experimenters to archive experimental apparatus definitions or components, which can be used as building blocks for constructing new apparatus definitions. These definitions can then be realized using core DeterLab embedder capabilities. Future work includes building the workbench technology to support archiving and reusing containers, and enhancing the embedder to provide visibility and control over resource utilization and fidelity/scale trade-offs.

### Model-Based Experimentation

As described in Section 3.5, DeterLab experimenters face a "big data" problem, which will only grow as DeterLab increases the scale and breadth of tools for collecting experimental data. Our approach to this problem is to completely reconceive the methodology for defining cybersecurity experiments to yield data for analysis.

#### Methodological Framework
The conceptual starting point of an experiment is a real-world situation with an interesting problem that is inconvenient to investigate in situ. We define a conceptual model of the situation and create a laboratory activity to construct a physical (or chemical, biological, or informatic) model of the real-world situation. This model serves as a design for an experimental apparatus, allowing experimenters to make inferences from lab observations to the real world.

#### Early Use of DETER Testbed
Early use of the DETER testbed was not significantly model-based. Figure 3 illustrates an ad-hoc constructed apparatus with no externally visible relation between the model and the apparatus. While the lab procedures were valuable, they were ad hoc and difficult to document or repeat.

#### Current Work in DETER
The DETER research program includes work to assist researchers in defining several model-related structures that become part of the methodology for building experimental apparatus, defining experimental procedures, and analyzing experimental data for expected or unexpected patterns or changes predicted by the model or a hypothesis derived from it.

#### Tools and Techniques
Several types of tools under investigation include:
- Semantic mechanisms to capture the experimenter's intent.
- Support for monitoring this intent and distributed execution with breakpoints.
- Abstraction and modeling techniques for experiment design, realization, visualization, and analysis.

**Figure 5: Development of Experimental Knowledge from Experiment Data**

Using the workbench and tools, experimenters can refine models into apparatus templates or experiment-procedure definitions, which can be used to plan data analysis. The analysis follows a knowledge discovery procedure derived from the model and its components, ensuring semantically validated experiment design and execution.

#### Cyber-Physical Experiments
Model-based experimentation is increasingly important when designing experiments that span both cyber and physical elements. The physical components are likely based on real-world, empirical, or theoretical models. To capture interactions and relations between cyber and physical elements, it is necessary to compose models. Recent work in Secure Smart Grid Architectures [24] highlights the need for large-scale response modeling to cyber-attacks and physical system simulations.

### Additional Directions

The previous sections outlined key areas of our current research work, guided by lessons learned and our own research. The research program also includes areas for future work, such as:

- Further development of model-based experimentation.
- Enhancing the integration of container technology in the ELM workbench.
- Expanding the use of DeterLab for cyber-physical experiments.

These efforts aim to improve the robustness, scalability, and usability of DeterLab for a wide range of experimental scenarios.
