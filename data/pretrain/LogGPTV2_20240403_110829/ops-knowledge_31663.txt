User:  company needs continuous monitoring and log collection for its containerized applications, as well as alarms for exceptions. Please provide a solution.
Assistant: The following is a possible solution: 1. Use a containerized monitoring platform: You can choose to use an existing containerized monitoring platform, such as Prometheus, Grafana, etc. These platforms can support monitoring of applications running in containers, including monitoring of memory, CPU, etc., and can also collect and analyze application logs. 2. Integrated log engine: Integrated log engine can greatly enhance the ability of log collection, such as Rizhiyi, Fluentd, etc. These log engines can collect logs of containerized applications, support tracking and query in distributed systems, and provide powerful search and analysis functions. 3. Alarms and automated O&M: After monitoring and log collection, it is necessary to generate alarms for abnormal situations in real time and perform automated O&M processing. Pre-set alarm rules can be used. Once the rules are triggered, the corresponding processing procedures can be started, such as notifying the system administrator, calling automated scripts, and so on. Simple alarm tracking and processing can be easily realized by using the free version of the DingTalk OAP public alarm platform. 4. Security precautions: In order to ensure the security of containerized applications, you can choose to use container security detection tools. In this way, vulnerabilities and risks in applications can be quickly located, and comprehensive security defenses can be implemented for container infrastructure, networks, users, and other aspects. These can be selected and used according to actual needs to ensure the reliability, stability and security of containerized applications.
