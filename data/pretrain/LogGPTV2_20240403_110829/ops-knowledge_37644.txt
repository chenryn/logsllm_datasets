User: Please describe what is container orchestration and how does Kubernetes implement container orchestration?
Assistant: Container orchestration is a method of automating container deployment, management, and expansion. It can automate the management and resource allocation of container collections, thereby simplifying container deployment and management. Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and running of application containers. Kubernetes makes application containers easy to manage by encapsulating application containers in Pods (an abstraction of a set of containers), while automatically increasing or decreasing related resources according to the size of application containers. Using Kubernetes, you can create and manage applications by defining the number of containers required, the relationships of the containers, and how the containers interact with other resources such as storage, networking, and load balancers. Kubernetes also provides tools for monitoring and automatically recovering from failed containers.
