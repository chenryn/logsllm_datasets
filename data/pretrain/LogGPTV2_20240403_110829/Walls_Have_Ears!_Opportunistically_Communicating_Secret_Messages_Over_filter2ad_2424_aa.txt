ABSTRACT
Physical layer (PHY) security has aroused great research
interest in recent years, exploiting physical uncertainty of
wireless channels to provide communication secrecy without
placing any computational restrictions on the adversaries
under the information-theoretic security model. Particu-
larly, researches have been focused on investigating Wyner’s
Wiretap Channel for constructing practical wiretap codes
that can achieve simultaneous transmission secrecy and re-
liability. While theoretically sound, PHY security through
the wiretap channel has never been realized in practice, and
the feasibility and physical limitations of implementing such
channels in the real world are yet to be well understood. In
this paper, we design and implement a practical opportunis-
tic secret communication system over the wireless wiretap
channel for the ﬁrst time to our best knowledge. We show
that, our system can achieve nearly perfect secrecy given
a ﬁxed codeword length by carefully controlling the struc-
ture of the parity-check matrix of wiretap codes to strike
the proper balance between the transmission rate and se-
crecy. Our system is implemented and evaluated extensively
on a USRP N210-based testbed. The experimental results
demonstrate the physical limitations and the feasibility of
building practical wiretap channels in both the worst chan-
nel case and the case where the sender has only the knowl-
edge of instantaneous channel capacities. Our system design
and implementation successfully attempts towards bridging
the gap between the theoretical wiretap channel and its prac-
tice, alleviating the unrealistic and strong assumptions im-
posed by the theoretical model.

INTRODUCTION
Diﬀerent from classical cryptography, information-theoret
-ic security guarantees message secrecy without relying on
the computational hardness of mathematical problems [9,
20]. Based on the information-theoretic security principles,
physical layer (PHY) security places no computational re-
strictions on adversaries, and it can provide an additional
layer of security besides cryptographic protocols implemented
in the upper layers. Due to its unique properties, PHY se-
curity has aroused considerable research interest in recent
years.
To achieve PHY security, there are two main research
streams: generating secret keys from correlated observa-
tions between the legitimate sender and receiver [7, 3], and
transmitting secret messages between the legitimate sender
and receiver by leveraging their physical advantage over the
eavesdropper’s channel through wiretap coding [20, 9, 19].
By separately dealing with reliability and security constraints,
secret key generation from correlated observations turns out
to be a much simpler problem, and many eﬀective key-
agreement protocols have been proposed by exploiting the
inherent randomness of wireless fading channels [13, 16].
The fundamental limits of secret key generation from source
or channel models, however, are not as well understood
as those of secret communications over wiretap channels,
mainly due to harder analysis of two-way communications
than the one-way paradigm. Meanwhile, wiretap codes ca-
pable of guaranteeing communication reliability and secrecy
have been proved to exist. Consequently, over years re-
searchers have put a great deal of eﬀort into constructing
practical wiretap codes to achieve asymptotic perfect se-
crecy [19, 11, 10]. Based on these codes, the secrecy (outage)
capacity under diﬀerent constraints, e.g., transmission delay
and power, have also been investigated recently [6, 12, 8].
376While theoretically sound, so far PHY security through the
wiretap channel has not been realized in practice due to its
design and implementation challenges brought by strong as-
sumptions made in theory and the dynamic feature of wire-
less channels, and the feasibility and physical limitations of
implementing the wiretap channel in the real world are yet
to be well understood.
Can we realize the theoretical wiretap channel in the real
world? We answer this question in the aﬃrmative by pre-
senting a practical opportunistic secret communication sys-
tem, letting the legitimate sender communicate secret mes-
sages right away over wireless channels under the wiretap
channel model. The key advantage of our system over cryp-
tographic solutions is in terms of information-theoretic physical-
layer security. As an immediate application, it enables key
exchange between two trusted parties without pre-knowledge
of any shared secret or certiﬁcates to be set up a priori. We
show that it is always possible to establish a secure mes-
sage communication channel which has a “physical advan-
tage” over the eavesdropper in wireless indoor environments.
We, for the ﬁrst time, design and implement a software de-
ﬁned secret communication system on a USRP N210 based
testbed. Our system design has to address several challenges
unique to the nature of multipath fading channels and the
asymptotic assumptions made in theory. To this end, we
present a novel and eﬃcient technique to trade moderate
transmission rate for high secrecy, which takes the advan-
tage of the internal structure of wiretap code construction.
Our experimental results show that there exist multiple “re-
stricted zones”, where if the eavesdropper locates, secret
communications over the wiretap channel can be realized
in the worst channel case. When the knowledge of the chan-
nel statistics are available at the sender, we estimate in-
stantaneous channel capacities on the main channel and the
eavesdropper’s channel in terms of bits per channel use us-
ing measured bit error rates (BERs). To sum up, the main
contributions of our work are as follows.
• We present the design of a secure and reliable secret
communication system under the wireless wiretap chan-
nel. We investigate both the worst channel application
scenario without dynamic knowledge of channel statis-
tics and the scenario where channel statistics are avail-
able for dynamic code selection.
• We tackle the challenges of tuning the theoretical cod-
ing channel to the physical channel, alleviating unreal-
istic and strong assumptions imposed on the theoreti-
cal model, and accessing the instantaneously changing
channel state information in practice.
• We present the implementation and an extensive eval-
uation of our system in a typical indoor environment.
Our results provide a detailed characterization of the
system and uncover the feasibility and constraints for
realizing the wiretap channel in practice.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We
describe the system model and background in Section 2,
and discuss the gap between theory and practice for wire-
tap channel in Section 3. We present the software deﬁned
design of the secret communication system in 4. Extensive
evaluations using simulations are shown in Section 5. We
implement the wiretap channel in the real world and eval-
uate its performance in Section 6. Finally, we conclude our
paper in Section 7.

2. SYSTEM MODEL AND BACKGROUND
2.1 System Overview
We design and implement a secret wireless communica-
tion system based on the classic wiretap channel model as
illustrated in Fig. 1. In this model, a legitimate sender (Al-
ice) transmits messages to a legitimate receiver (Bob) over
a multipath fading channel (called the main channel), while
an eavesdropper (Eve) passively listens to the messages over
another independent multipath fading channel (called the
eavesdropper’s channel). For the multipath fading chan-
nel, we consider “approximately” quasi-static fading chan-
nels, where fading coeﬃcients remain approximately con-
stant over the transmission of two or more codewords. The
time required to send a single symbol is much smaller than
the duration of a coherence interval. The experimental re-
sults suggest that this theoretical model is most consistent
with our system implementation in indoor environments.
In a slotted system, a codeword is transmitted over N
channel uses. At the end of the transmission of codeword t,
the observed signals at the receiver and at the eavesdropper
are given by:
Y(t) = Hm(t)X(t) + Nm(t) and Z(t) = He(t)X(t) + Ne(t), (1)
respectively, where X(t) ∈ CN is the transmitted signal vec-
tor, Y(t) ∈ CN is the received signal vector by the legiti-
mate receiver, and Z(t) ∈ CN is the received signal vector
by the eavesdropper. The fading coeﬃcient Hm(t) of the
main channel and the fading coeﬃcient He(t) of the eaves-
dropper accounts for the multipath interference in wireless
transmissions. Furthermore, the processes {Hm(t)}t≥1 and
{He(t)}t≥1 are mutually independent and i.i.d., and the
square of the magnitude of the fading coeﬃcients Gm =
||Hm||2 and Ge = ||He||2 are called fading gains.
The transmitted signals are corrupted by the noise vectors
{Nm(t)}t≥1 and {Ne(t)}t≥1, which are i.i.d. complex Gaus-
sian with Nm(t) ∼ CN (0, σ2
e ) at the
receiver and at the eavesdropper, respectively. Finally, the
transmission of {X(t)}t≥1 is subject to a short-term power
constraint 1

We consider two typical secret message transmission appli-
cation scenarios in an indoor environment: with the noiseless
main channel and with the noisy main channel. Our exper-
imental results indicate that when Alice communicates to
Bob in a room, the channel between them (i.e., the main
channel) is fairly good and is advantageous over Eve’s chan-
nel (i.e., the eavesdropper’s channel), who hides at certain
locations behind walls.
In the theoretical model, Alice is
always required to know the instantaneous channel state
H = (Hm(t), He(t)). The knowledge of Hm(t) is reason-
able since the legitimate transceivers can always cooperate
to characterize the main channel. We show in Section 4
that, this assumption can be further eliminated when the
ENCODERDECODERALICEBOBEVEDECODERMXHmHeNmNeYZ377main channel is fairly good. When the knowledge of the
channel statistics is necessary to Alice, we place multiple
USRP N210-based sensors around the communicating area,
facilitating channel capacity estimation in a practical set-
ting.
In the system, we also assume that Eve knows the
coding scheme used by Alice.
For each codeword t, by the results in [9] the secrecy
rate that can be achieved in additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channels is
Cs(t) = [Cm(t) − Ce(t)]+,

where the channel bandwidth B can be normalized to 1,
Cm(t) and Ce(t) denote the capacity of the main channel
(instantaneous maximum achievable rate for the legitimate
receiver) and the capacity of the eavesdropper’s channel (in-
stantaneous maximum achievable rate for the eavesdrop-
per), respectively, P(H) is the power allocation function,
and [x]+ = max{0, x}. The secrecy capacity is the maxi-
mum transmission rate that is achievable, i.e., the number
of bits the receiver can decode per second with no decodable
bits at the eavesdropper. Theoretically, we can transmit
messages securely and reliably with a non-zero transmission
rate (called secrecy rate) whenever the eavesdropper’s obser-
vation Z(t) is “noisier” than Y(t). Note that, in this paper,
we take the ﬁrst step towards the realization of secret com-
munications under the wiretap channel model in practice,
and we do not consider optimal power allocation with the
variations of wireless channels in our system and assume
that the transmit power remains constant during the proto-
col execution. Obviously, by jointly considering the power
allocation the system performance can be further improved,
and we leave it as our future work.
2.2 Wiretap Codes: Properties and Availabil-
ity
To achieve secure and reliable transmission under positive
secrecy rate (the transmission rate is equal to the secrecy
rate when all transmissions are secured), we rely on chan-
nel coding techniques that asymptotically guarantee both
reliability at the intended receiver and secrecy against the
eavesdropper. Such codes are called wiretap codes. In the
coding function, it is the local randomness introduced by
the source (only available to the sender) that enables trans-
mission secrecy. While reliability calls for the introduction
of redundancy to mitigate the eﬀect of channel noise, too
much redundancy will aﬀect the secrecy. These two seem-
ingly contradictory requirements can be precisely controlled
by carefully-designed codes. A typical wiretap code should
satisfy two properties: i) the same message should be rep-
resented by multiple codewords uniquely and the choice of
codewords should be random; ii) the codewords are a func-
tion of original messages M’s and the local randomness R,
which are independent with each other. Using the results
in [2], in our paper we deﬁne the information leakage to the
eavesdropper as
L(Cn) = I(M; Zn|Cn)
= I(Xn; Zn|Cn) − H(R|Cn) + H(R|ZnMCn).

To achieve reliable communications in full secrecy, we must
choose code Cn that at least ensures the leakage rate 1
≤ ε for arbitrarily small ε > 0.

Note that, in this paper, we restrict ourselves to the de-
sign, the implementation and the evaluation of secret com-
munications under the wiretap channel model other than
the design of wiretap codes. In the following discussions, we
introduce two eﬃcient code constructions for our purpose.

We ﬁrst restrict ourselves to a wiretap channel model
where the main channel is noiseless but the eavesdropper’s
channel is a binary erasure channel (BEC) with erasure
probability . Thus, the resulting capacity of a BEC is 1− .
In real life, this corresponds to the scenario where the le-
gitimate sender and the legitimate receiver communicates
to each other at a short range (e.g., in a room). Due to
