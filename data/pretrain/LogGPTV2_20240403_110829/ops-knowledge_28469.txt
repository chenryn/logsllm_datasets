User: I have supervisord run a program as user stavros, and I would like to give the same user permission to restart it using supervisorctl. Unfortunately, I can only do it with sudo, otherwise I get a permission denied error in socket.py. How can I give myself permission to restart supervisord processes?
Assistant: Maybe you should try restarting your superviord process using user stavros.
