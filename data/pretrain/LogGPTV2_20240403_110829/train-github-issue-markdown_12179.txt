Hi,

I am encountering an issue with an uncontrolled `IconMenu` component. When the menu is displayed and a `MenuItem` is clicked, the menu closes as expected. However, clicking anywhere else after this action triggers the following warning:

```
Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op. Please check the code for the IconMenu component.
```

The call stack for this warning is as follows:
- `warning` at `bundle.js:2198`
- `getInternalInstanceReadyForUpdate` at `bundle.js:5913`
- `ReactUpdateQueue.enqueueSetState` at `bundle.js:6060`
- `ReactComponent.setState` at `bundle.js:15918`
- `close` at `bundle.js:54613`
- `requestClose` at `bundle.js:42206`
- `componentClickAway` at `bundle.js:42210`
- `onClickAway` at `bundle.js:42509`

Additionally, there is a more significant issue: the number of errors reported per click increases with each subsequent show/dismiss cycle of the menu. For example, during the first occurrence, only one error is reported per click. The next time the menu is shown and dismissed, two errors are reported per click. This pattern suggests that the menu is not properly cleaning up event listeners, which could lead to memory leaks.

Could you please review the `IconMenu` component to ensure that all event listeners are being correctly removed when the component unmounts?

Thank you.
