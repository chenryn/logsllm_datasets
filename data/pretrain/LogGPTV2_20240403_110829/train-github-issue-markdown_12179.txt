Hi,
I have a simple IconMenu which is not controlled. Once the menu is displayed
and any MenuItem is clicked, the menu closes as expected. However clicking
anywhere after this logs the error -
`Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This
usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-
op. Please check the code for the IconMenu component.`
The call-stack is -
warning @ bundle.js:2198  
getInternalInstanceReadyForUpdate @ bundle.js:5913  
ReactUpdateQueue.enqueueSetState @ bundle.js:6060  
ReactComponent.setState @ bundle.js:15918  
close @ bundle.js:54613  
requestClose @ bundle.js:42206  
componentClickAway @ bundle.js:42210  
onClickAway @ bundle.js:42509
And a bigger issue is that the error count per click keeps increasing on every
subsequent menu show/dismiss cycle. E.g. during the very first occurrence,
only one error is reported per click. The next time I click on the icon to
show the menu and then dismiss it by selecting some item, **two** errors are
reported per click. This would happen if the menu is not cleaning up events
correctly and would eventually lead to leaks.
