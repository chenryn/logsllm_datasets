### 5. The Application Mix: A Moving Target

#### 5.1 The Aggregate View

The Internet’s application mix has been the subject of numerous studies by networking researchers and commercial entities. In this section, we compare the observed application mix at our IXP with other recent studies that used different vantage points and classification methods. Note that our study only considers traffic traversing the IXP's public peering links, with no visibility into private peering traffic.

**Table 2.** Summary of prior studies and their reported application mixes, including the type of traffic data and classification method used. A comparison suggests that the Internet’s application mix is relatively homogeneous, with HTTP(S) dominating at around 60%. Other protocols like BitTorrent or P2P vary regionally from 10% to 30%, which may also be influenced by different classification approaches.

#### 5.2 Beyond the Aggregate Application Mix

To further analyze the homogeneity of the Internet’s application mix, we examine the application mix of traffic on specific networks' peering links.

**Figure 5.** Application mix for the top-15 traffic-contributing member ASes and top-3 transit providers at our IXP, grouped by business type. Content/CDN networks show a high dominance of HTTP(S) traffic, with one network showing a nearly 50/50 split between HTTP and HTTPS. Hoster/IaaS networks have a more diverse profile, with significant shares of BitTorrent and unclassified traffic. Eyeball/Access networks also show variability, with some having more than 50% BitTorrent traffic, particularly in eastern European countries.

**Figure 6.** Application mix for the top-25 traffic-carrying bidirectional links, including the business types of the networks involved. Content-to-Eyeball links primarily carry HTTP(S) traffic, while BitTorrent dominates on two Eyeball-to-Eyeball links. Transit and Hoster/IaaS links show more heterogeneous mixes.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we developed a stateful classification methodology to overcome the challenges of packet-sampled traffic. Using this approach, we attributed over 78% of the bytes exchanged over the IXP's public switching infrastructure to their respective applications. Including heuristics based on communication patterns and port-based classification, we classified an additional 15.5%. The aggregate application mix at our IXP is consistent with other recent studies, but when examining individual peering links, the mix becomes more heterogeneous and is strongly influenced by the business types of the networks involved.
