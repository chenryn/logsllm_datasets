### Title: PyQt4 GUI Application Requires Sudo Privileges and Displays Ugly Interface

**Clarification:**

I am using Ubuntu and have developed a GUI application with Qt Designer 4 and PyQt4. The application runs perfectly when I execute `python main.py` in the terminal. However, after a recent update, the program now requires sudo privileges to start, so I run it with `sudo python main.py`.

Unfortunately, this change has resulted in an extremely unappealing interface. I am unsure how to restore the normal, visually appealing interface for this and future applications. Is there a way to set a variable in Python or execute a command-line code to resolve this issue? The application is intended for deployment on Linux machines only.

**Additional Note:**
I have searched extensively online but have not found a working solution.

**Assistant's Response:**

One possible solution, though a bit of a workaround, is to install `qt4-qtconfig` and configure the GUI style. Here are the steps:

1. **Install `qt4-qtconfig`:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install qt4-qtconfig
   ```

2. **Run `qtconfig` with sudo or `gksudo`:**
   ```sh
   sudo qtconfig
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   gksudo qtconfig
   ```

3. **Change the GUI Style to GTK+:**
   - Open the `qtconfig` tool.
   - Navigate to the "GUI Style" section.
   - Select "GTK+" from the available styles.
   - Apply the changes and exit the tool.

This should help in restoring a more visually appealing interface when running your application with sudo privileges.

**Edited:**
Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and dependencies installed. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
