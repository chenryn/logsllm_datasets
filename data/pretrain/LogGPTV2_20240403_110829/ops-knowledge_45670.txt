User: Ok the title explains it all. But just to clarify. 
I have Ubuntu and programed a GUI app with Qt Designer 4 and PyQt4. The program works fine running python main.py in terminal.
Last week I made an update and now the program needs sudo privelages to start. So I type sudo python main.py.
But Oh my GODDDDDDD. What an ungly inteface came up. O.o
And I don't know how to get the realy nice normal-mode interface in my programm and all of my others programs i'll make. Is there any way to set a vaiable to python? Do I need to execute any command line code? 
The program is deployed only in Linux machines. 
P.S.
I search a lot in the web and couldn't find a working solution.
Assistant: This is a hacky solution.    

Install qt-qtconf. sudo apt-get install qt4-qtconfig
Run sudo qtconfig or gksudo qtconfig.
Change GUI Style to GTK+.

Edited.
