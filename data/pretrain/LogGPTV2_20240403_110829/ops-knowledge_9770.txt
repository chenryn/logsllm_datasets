User: In Google App Engine, there is such a thing as a ListProperty that allows you to hold a list (array) of items. You may also specify the type of the item being held, for instance string, integer, or whatever. 
Google App Engine also allows you to have a ReferenceProperty. A ReferenceProperty "contains" a reference to another Google App Engine Model entity. If you access a ReferenceProperty, it will automatically retrieve the actual entity that the reference points to. This is convenient, as it beats getting the key, and then getting the entity for said key.
However, I do not see any such thing as a ListReferenceProperty (or ReferenceListProperty). I would like to hold a list of references to other entities, that would automatically be resolved when I attempt to access elements within the list. The closest I can get it seems is to hold a list of db.Key objects. I can use these keys to then manually retrieve their associated entities from the server.
Is there any good solution to this? Basically, I would like the ability to have a collection of (auto-dereferencing) references to other entities. I can almost get there by having a collection of keys to other entities, but I would like it to "know" that these are key items, and that it could dereference them as a service to me.
Thank you
Assistant: You're right, there's no built in ReferenceListProperty. It'd be possible to write one yourself - custom Property subclasses are generally fairly easy - but getting it right is harder than you'd think, when it comes to deferencing and caching a list of references.
You can use a db.ListProperty(db.Key), however, which allows you to store a list of keys. Then, you can load them individually or all at once using a batch db.get() operation. This requires you to do the resolution step yourself, but it also gives you more control over when you dereference entities.
