This RequestMapping doesn't work:
    @RequestMapping(value = "/administration/user/{id}/account/{accountId}/transfer/{accounttransferId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
This RequestMapping works:
    @RequestMapping(value = "/administration/account/{accountId}/transfer/{accounttransferId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
During startup, in both cases, Spring says that the above urls have been
matched to a Class. There is only one method in the class to make sure nothing
is being overridden. It seems this happens the moment I have more than 2
PathVariables defined.
