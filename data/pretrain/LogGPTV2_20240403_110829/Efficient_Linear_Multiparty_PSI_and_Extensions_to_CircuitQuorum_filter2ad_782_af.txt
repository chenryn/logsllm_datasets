is correct, for 𝜅 = 40.
Security. Let 𝐶 ⊂ [𝑛] be the set of corrupted parties (|𝐶| = 𝑡  𝑥 ≥ 𝑘. Similarly, for 𝑘 < 𝑛/2, consider the polyno-
mial 𝜓(𝑥) = 𝑥 · (𝑥 − 1) · (𝑥 − 2) · · · (𝑥 − (𝑘 − 1)), of degree 𝑘, that
satisfies the following property: 𝜓(𝑥) = 0 for all 0 ≤ 𝑥 < 𝑘. The
protocol takes as input [𝑎] and for 𝐽 values of random 𝑠 𝑗’s in F𝑝,
evaluates [𝜓(𝑎) ·𝑠 𝑗] using the MultF𝑛,𝑡 functionality. Subsequently,
𝑃1 recovers 𝜓(𝑎) · 𝑠 𝑗, for each 𝑗 ∈ [𝐽]. If 𝜓(𝑎) · 𝑠 𝑗 = 0, for each
𝑗 ∈ [𝐽], then 𝜓(𝑎) = 0 with probability 1 − 2−𝜏, where 𝜏 is a con-
