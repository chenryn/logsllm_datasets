Important
Client summary:
Common browsing/use scenarios where client is “owned” with warnings or prompts, or via extensive actions without prompts. Note that this does not discriminate over the quality/usability of a prompt and likelihood a user might click through the prompt, but just that a prompt of some form exists.
Elevation of privilege (remote)
Execution of arbitrary code with extensive user action
All write AVs, exploitable read AVs, or integer overflows in remote callable code (with extensive user action)
Elevation of privilege (local)
Local low privilege user can elevate themselves to another user, administrator, or local system.
All write AVs, exploitable read AVs, or integer overflows in local callable code
Information disclosure (targeted)
Cases where the attacker can locate and read information on the system, including system information that was not intended or designed to be exposed.
Example:
Unauthorized file system access: reading from the file system
Disclosure of PII
Disclosure of PII (email addresses, phone numbers)
Phone home scenarios
Denial of service
System corruption DoS requires re-installation of system and/or components.
Example:
Visiting a web page causes registry corruption that makes the machine unbootable
Drive-by DoS
Criteria:
Un-authenticated System DoS
Default exposure
No default security features or boundary mitigations (firewalls)
No user interaction
No audit and punish trail
Example:
Drive-by Bluetooth system DoS or SMS in a mobile phone
Spoofing
Ability for attacker to present a UI that is different from but visually identical to the UI that users must rely on to make valid trust decisions in a default/common scenario. A trust decision is defined as any time the user takes an action believing some information is being presented by a particular entity—either the system or some specific local or remote source.
Examples:
Displaying a different URL in the browser’s address bar from the URL of the site that the browser is actually displaying in a default/common scenario
Displaying a window over the browser’s address bar that looks identical to an address bar but displays bogus data in a default/common scenario
Displaying a different file name in a “Do you want to run this program?” dialog box than that of the file that will actually be loaded in a default/common scenario
Display a “fake” login prompt to gather user or account credentials
Tampering
Permanent modification of any user data or data used to make trust decisions in a common or default scenario that persists after restarting the OS/application.
Examples:
Web browser cache poisoning
Modification of significant OS/application settings without user consent
Modification of user data
Security features: Breaking or bypassing any security feature provided
Examples:
Disabling or bypassing a firewall with informing user or gaining consent
Reconfiguring a firewall and allowing connection to other processes
Using weak encryption or keeping the keys stored in plain text
AccessCheck bypass
Bitlocker bypass; for example not encrypting part of the drive
Syskey bypass, a way to decode the syskey without the password
Moderate
Denial of service
Permanent DoS requires cold reboot or causes Blue Screen/Bug Check.
Example:
Opening a Word document causes the machine to Blue Screen/Bug Check.
Information disclosure (targeted)
Cases where the attacker can read information on the system from known locations, including system information that was not intended or designed to be exposed.
Examples:
Targeted existence of file
Targeted file version number
Spoofing
Ability for attacker to present a UI that is different from but visually identical to the UI that users are accustomed to trust in a specific scenario. &quot;Accustomed to trust&quot; is defined as anything a user is commonly familiar with based on normal interaction with the operating system or application but does not typically think of as a &quot;trust decision.&quot;
Examples:
Web browser cache poisoning
Modification of significant OS/application settings without user consent
Modification of user data
Low
Denial of service
Temporary DoS requires restart of application.
Example:
Opening a HTML document causes Internet Explorer to crash
Spoofing
Ability for attacker to present a UI that is different from but visually identical to the UI that is a single part of a bigger attack scenario.
Example:
User has to go a “malicious” web site, click on a button in spoofed dialog box, and is then susceptible to a vulnerability based on a different browser bug
Tampering
Temporary modification of any data that does not persist after restarting the OS/application.
Information disclosure (untargeted)
Example:
Leak of random heap memory
## Definition of Terms  
**authenticated**  
Any attack which has to include authenticating by the network. This
implies that logging of some type must be able to occur so that the
attacker can be identified.  
**anonymous**  
Any attack which does not need to authenticate to complete.  
**client**  
Either software that runs locally on a single computer or software that
accesses shared resources provided by a server over a network.  
**default/common**  
Any features that are active out of the box or that reach more than 10
percent of users.  
**scenario**  
Any features that require special customization or use cases to enable,
reaching less than 10 percent of users.  
**server**  
Computer that is configured to run software that awaits and fulfills
requests from client processes that run on other computers.  
**Critical**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as
having the highest potential for damage.
**Important**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as
having significant potential for damage, but less than Critical.
**Moderate**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as
having moderate potential for damage, but less than Important.
**Low**  
A security vulnerability that would be rated as having
low potential for damage.
**targeted information disclosure**  
Ability to intentionally select (target) desired information.  
**temporary DoS**  
A temporary DoS is a situation where the following criteria are met:
  - The target cannot perform normal operations due to an attack.
  - The response to an attack is roughly the same magnitude as the size
    of the attack.
  - The target returns to the normal level of functionality shortly
    after the attack is finished. The exact definition of "shortly"
    should be evaluated for each product.
For example, a server is unresponsive while an attacker is constantly
sending a stream of packets across a network, and the server returns to
normal a few seconds after the packet stream stops.
**temporary DoS with amplification**
A temporary DoS with amplification is a situation where the following
criteria are met:
  - The target cannot perform normal operations due to an attack.
  - The response to an attack is magnitudes beyond the size of the
    attack.
  - The target returns to the normal level of functionality after the
    attack is finished, but it takes some time (perhaps a few minutes).
For example, if you can send a malicious 10-byte packet and cause a
2048k response on the network, you are DoSing the bandwidth by
amplifying our attack effort.
**permanent DoS**
A permanent DoS is one that requires an administrator to start, restart,
or reinstall all or parts of the system. Any vulnerability that
automatically restarts the system is also a permanent
DoS.
