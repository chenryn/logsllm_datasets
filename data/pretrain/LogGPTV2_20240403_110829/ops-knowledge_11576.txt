Question: A security consultant is reviewing a client's web application that currently employs X-Frame-Options to mitigate clickjacking attacks. The consultant suggests deprecating XFO in favor of implementing a robust Content Security Policy (CSP). Which of the following would be the best counterargument against deprecating XFO?
"A": "CSP provides an equivalent level of protection against clickjacking and is more flexible, making the deprecation of XFO unnecessary.",
"B": "CSP is not widely supported by all browsers, and maintaining XFO would ensure better compatibility and protection.",
"C": "XFO is a newer standard than CSP, providing more advanced protection mechanisms.",
"D": "Referrer Policy alone can provide sufficient protection against clickjacking, rendering both XFO and CSP redundant."
Answer: B
