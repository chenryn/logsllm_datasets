It would be useful to have a definitive example of cleaning up
objects/scenes/mesh/geometry and any etc's. This would be useful for those
that want to carry out changes dynamically by recreating a mesh.
Please also show when and how any reuse of a structure might be more
appropiate. As newbie I'm not sure what is meant by phrases like "reusing" a
geometry.
