a quality of service (QoS) in terms of network connectivity
for the nodes in the system at a given level of unavailabil-
ity. Suppose further that the QoS requirement is that the
probability of disconnection of a node at a high unavail-
ability c = 0.9 is below the threshold τ = 0.05. As noted
in [28], the probability of disconnection of a node with de-
gree d is DP (d) = cd. Hence, to satisfy the QoS requirement
of the system, nearly every node needs to have its degree
d ≥ dτ = 30, since DP (30) = 0.930  τ for a large fraction of nodes,
the value of k(i) is increased additively to k(i+1) for the next
iteration (i + 1). Otherwise, if r ≤ τ for nearly every node,
the iterations are stopped, and the ﬁnal ranked list size is
set to k = k(b) where b is the ﬁnal iteration.
6. EVALUATION
This section presents an extensive evaluation of our ap-
proach, primarily examining the robustness of the social
overlay network in terms of network connectivity and the
