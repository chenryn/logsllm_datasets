User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What are some ways to store Tomcat 6 stdout and stderr logs to external server? Due to compliance issues, there is a need to store all tomcat logs for at least 6 months on a central server. 

Is there a way to send the logs to rsyslog server or any other mechanism that will accomplish the task. I tried changing CATALINA_OUT to /var/log/syslog, and it does record it in the file however rsyslog-mysql does not pick it up.

Short of sending the logs to a remote host, what are some ways to move the logs automatically besides using rsync, cron, scp

Assistant: Here is an interesting thread about your question. If this really leads to a solution is not sure. A working approach is to output to stdout and pipe that to logger - but this is not a "clean" solution.
