User: On a Linux server, install and configure the Elasticsearch search engine, and import test data. Please provide a complete how-to guide.
Assistant: The following are the detailed steps to install and configure the Elasticsearch search engine on the Linux server: 1. Install the Java runtime environment on the Linux server Elasticsearch is a search engine developed based on Java, so the Java runtime environment needs to be installed on the Linux server. It can be installed by the following command: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install default-jre ``` 2. Download and install the Elasticsearch search engine You can download the Elasticsearch compressed package from the official website, unzip it on the server after downloading and specify Directory, such as: ``` wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.13.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz tar -zxvf elasticsearch-7.13.2-linux-x86_64.tar. gz sudo mv elasticsearch-7.13.2 /usr/share/elasticsearch ``` 3. Install and configure Elasticsearch plug-ins Elasticsearch has various plug-ins for use, which can be installed and configured according to specific needs. Take installing the IK word segmentation plugin as an example: ``` sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik/releases/download/v7.13.2/elasticsearch -analysis-ik-7.13.2.zip ``` 4. Start the Elasticsearch search engine Use the following command to start Elasticsearch: ``` sudo systemctl start elasticsearch ``` 5. Configure the Elasticsearch cluster parameters and modify the configuration file /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch .yml, configure cluster parameters, such as: ``` cluster.name: my_cluster node.name: node_1 network.host: 0.0.0.0 http.port: 9200 discovery.seed_hosts: ["127.0.0.1"] ``` 6. To test whether Elasticsearch is running normally, you can use the curl command to test whether Elasticsearch is running normally, such as: ``` curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200" ``` If the following results are returned, it means that Elasticsearch has been successfully installed and configured: ``` { "name" : "node-1", "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch", "cluster_uuid" : "D-za9OmLTVaOwiKiZpFKMw", "version" : { "number" : "7.13.2", "build_flavor" : "default", "build_type" : "tar", "build_hash" : "4d960a0733be83dd2543ca018aa4ddc42e956800", "build_date" : "2021-06-10T21:01:55.251515791Z", "build_snaps hot" : false, "lucene_version" : "8.8 .2", "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0", "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1" }, "tagline" : "You Know, for Search" } ``` 7. Import test data into Elasticsearch To import test data, you can use the following command: ``` curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:9200/bank/_bulk?pretty&refresh" --data-binary "@accounts.json" `` ` Among them, accounts.json is the JSON file of the test data, and bank is the index name. Test data can be downloaded on the Elasticsearch website. So far, the installation, configuration and testing of the Elasticsearch search engine on the Linux server have been completed.
