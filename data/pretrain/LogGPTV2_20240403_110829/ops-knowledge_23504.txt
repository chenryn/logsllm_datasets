User: I am using Python 2.7.3 in Ubuntu 12.04 OS. I have an external program say 'xyz' whose input is a single file and two files say 'abc.dat' and 'gef.dat' are its output. 
When I used os.system or subprocess.check_output or os.popen none of them printed the output files in the working directory. 
I need these output files for further calculations. 
Plus I've to keep calling the 'xyz' program 'n' times and have to keep getting the output 'abc.dat' and 'gef.dat' every time from it. Please help.
Thank you
Assistant: I can not comment on your question because my reputation is too low.
If you use os.system or subprocess.check_output or os.popen, you will just get the standard output of your xyz program (if it is printing something in the screen). To see the files in some directory, you can use os.listdir(). Then you can use these files in your script afterwards. It may also be worth using subprocess.check_call.
There may be other better and more efficient solutions.
