Question: An incident responder is analyzing the security features of various Apple devices to prepare for potential forensic recovery situations. Considering the information about Apple's security features for different SoC families, select the statements that accurately describe the capabilities and protections provided by these features.
"A": "For devices with the A12 SoC, the Secure Enclave Boot ROM locks the passcode seed bit upon entering DFU mode, preventing any operation to change it.",
"B": "The Secure Enclave AES Engine's use of lockable software seed bits to create key hierarchies is discontinued starting with the A10 SoC.",
"C": "Sealed Key Protection (SKP) ensures cryptographic material is unavailable off device and is a feature exclusive to devices with Apple-designed SoCs.",
"D": "When a device with an A10 or later SoC boots into Diagnostics mode, user data is not cryptographically inaccessible as the media key required for file access remains available."
Answer: AC
