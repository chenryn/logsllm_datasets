### Analysis and Classification of WPN Clusters

In our study, we identified 24 URLs linked to unpopular blog/news sites, 3 leading to adult websites, and 4 hosting non-English content that could not be verified. Given the lack of complete information from VirusTotal (VT) and Google Safe Browsing (GSB), we adopted a conservative approach and removed the malicious label from these sites. Consequently, we labeled 1,344 WPNs as known malicious. Among these, 758 WPNs were part of 572 WPN clusters previously classified as ad campaigns (Section 6.3.1). The remaining 586 WPNs, which led to malicious landing pages, did not immediately belong to any WPN ad clusters, forming separate small clusters. We will determine their relationship to WPN campaigns in Section 6.3.3 after the meta-clustering step (Section 5.3).

### Label Propagation and Malicious WPN Ad Campaigns

Using a "guilty by association" label propagation policy (Section 5.2), we labeled WPN ad campaigns as malicious if they included at least one known malicious WPN. This policy is justified by the close similarity in content and landing page URL paths within the same cluster. This process yielded 152 out of 572 malicious WPN ad campaigns, containing 376 WPNs (or their landing pages) that VT or GSB missed. Manual inspection confirmed that 367 of these 376 WPN ads were indeed malicious, leading to survey scams, phishing pages, scareware, fake alerts, and social media scams. The remaining 9 ads (2.4%) led to different pages hosted on the same IP address, thanking users for subscribing to notifications. Our clustering approach increased the number of confirmed malicious WPN ads from 758 to 1,125, representing a 50% increase, as summarized in Table 4, first row.

### Detailed Cluster Analysis

For example, in cluster WPN-C1, 35 out of 40 WPNs were labeled as known malicious by VT. PushAdMiner labeled the entire cluster as malicious. Manual inspection confirmed that the remaining 5 messages were related to the 35 malicious sweepstakes/survey scam ads.

### Identifying Suspicious Ads

To identify suspicious WPN ads, we leveraged labels from VT and GSB. However, both blocklists have significant false negatives in detecting malicious landing pages. For instance, in cluster WPN-C2, none of the 12 WPNs were labeled as malicious by VT. PushAdMiner flagged this cluster as suspicious due to duplicate ads, and manual inspection revealed that these WPNs displayed fake PayPal alerts leading to survey scam pages. This example highlights the gaps in current URL blocklisting services and their ineffectiveness in blocking malicious ad notifications.

### Meta-Clustering Approach

We applied a meta-clustering method to group WPN clusters sharing common landing page domains. A bipartite graph \( G = (W, D, E) \) was created, where \( W \) is the set of all 8,780 WPN clusters, and \( D \) is the set of 2,177 distinct landing page domains. By identifying connected components, we found 2,046 WPN meta clusters, with 224 containing a mix of ad campaign and non-campaign WPN clusters. All WPN messages in these 224 ad-related meta-clusters were labeled as WPN ads, increasing the total from 3,213 to 5,143.

### Examples of Meta Clusters

Figure 5 provides two examples of meta clusters. Figure 5a includes cluster WPN-C1 and other 6 related WPN ad campaigns, likely orchestrated by the same operators. This meta-cluster contains many known malicious WPN ad campaigns, and all WPN clusters within it were labeled as suspicious. Manual inspection confirmed that all involved domains hosted visually similar malicious pages, such as online survey scam pages. Figure 5b shows another meta-cluster, including WPN-C2 and 30 other related WPN ad clusters. None of the WPN clusters were initially labeled as malicious, but manual inspection confirmed that they displayed fake PayPal messages and alerts leading to survey scams and likely phishing-related pages.

### Labeling Suspicious WPN Messages

We considered WPN messages in a meta cluster as suspicious if the meta cluster contained at least one malicious WPN cluster or duplicate ad domains. Out of the 572 WPN ad campaigns, 255 contained duplicate ad domains, allowing us to label 287 out of 2,046 WPN meta clusters as suspicious. Additionally, 166 WPN ad campaigns, not previously labeled as malicious, were also labeled as suspicious. Overall, this resulted in 1,479 suspicious WPN ads, with 1,280 (86.5%) confirmed as malicious through manual verification. The remaining 199 WPN ads were flagged due to duplicate ad domains, with 166 related to job postings, 23 to horoscope content, 4 to adult websites, and 6 to subscription notifications.

### Singleton Clusters

Our tight first-stage clustering yielded 7,731 singleton clusters, with 6,876 sharing landing domains with WPNs in non-singleton clusters. After meta-clustering, 855 singleton clusters remained. Manual inspection of 200 singleton clusters revealed a mix of simple alerts and spurious suspicious ads. Table 5 provides examples of the text and domains related to these singleton clusters.

### Additional Measurements

To measure the prevalence of WPN ads over time, we collected data for 5 days between April 4th, 2020, and April 9th, 2020. Revisiting 300 randomly chosen websites, 35 sent 305 notifications. PushAdMiner labeled 198 WPN ads and flagged 48 as malicious, confirmed via manual analysis. Only 15 of these were flagged as malicious on VirusTotal, indicating that WPN-based threats often remain undetected by current defenses.

### Ad Networks and Blocking

Figure 6 shows the distribution of WPN ads, including malicious ones, per ad network. Many ad networks are abused to distribute malicious WPN ads. We also investigated the effectiveness of ad blocker extensions used by desktop browsers against WPN ads. As shown in Table 6, existing ad blockers were not sufficient to mitigate WPN-based ads, including malicious ones.

### Related Work

Previous studies have explored service workers and WPNs, focusing on attack techniques, risks, and security flaws. Our work differs by measuring the use of WPN messages as an ad-delivery platform and analyzing abuse in WPN ads. We designed and implemented an automated system to subscribe to, collect, interact with, and analyze WPN messages on both desktop and mobile platforms. Other studies have focused on the online advertisement ecosystem, traditional malicious web advertisements, and social engineering attacks. AdGraph, an advanced machine learning-based system, focuses on identifying online ads embedded in web pages but does not effectively handle WPNs.

This comprehensive analysis and classification of WPN clusters provide insights into the prevalence and nature of malicious WPN ads, highlighting the need for more effective detection and blocking mechanisms.
