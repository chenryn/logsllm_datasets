vendors, we use the period of 2013-2018. For the comparison
between vendors and OTI, we used the same subset as for

awareness is broader than detection, It is relevant in the plan-
ning and direction phases of the intelligence cycle [18]. . A
Team Lead TI at a bank said it is not just about cybersecurity:
“I believe that is too limited. It’s about understanding who
is a threat to my organization, not just the technical channel
used for the attack.”
SOC prioritization (50%) is a more practical use of TI,
e.g. to assess how critical alerts are or to direct threat hunting
efforts. This way, resources – especially attention of analysts
– can be allocated toward most relevant threats.
Informing business decisions (36%) concerns uses of TI
to improve organizational decision-making. For example, a
CISO used TI to evaluate the return on various options to
invest in security controls. But there are also organizations
that use paid TI to assess the risks associated with a potential
acquisition of international competitors, to gain a ‘business
decision advantage’. An analyst at a bank said: “Threat intel-
ligence means engaging with various business units in order
to understand their information needs, and then developing a
way to answer those in a timely way. As a consultative prac-
tice within [our organization] we could provide information
on geopolitical affairs, and intelligence on physical risks in
a country that [we are] operating in. It doesn’t necessarily
have to relate to cyber.” This use case, like situational aware-
ness, also underlines the value of reports compared to raw
indicators.
Enrichment of own threat intelligence (36%) where PTI
is processed with the aim to improve the organization’s own
services – e.g., by managed SOC providers and government
CERTs, as well as by TI teams to internal stakeholders. As
an MSSP manager stated: “We can give our customer the
reason why [their security appliance] generates this alert. We

Vendor 2, and 0.3% is listed by by AlienVault. Overall, PTI

set. The same subsets are used as for Figure 6.
of money compared to OTI and STI, they apparently value
PTI to be worth the asking price. We tried to understand their
perceptions of this value in two ways: by asking them how
they used PTI (use cases) and by asking about what they see
as strengths and weaknesses of their sources. These two ways
are aligned with the economic distinction between ‘stated
preferences’ versus ‘revealed preferences’. The former infers
preferences from what people explicitly state as preference,
the latter from their actual choices and behaviors.
7.1 Use cases of TI
Based on the analysis of the interviews, we found 9 use cases
for TI (Table 5). The percentages refer to what percentage of
the respondents mentioned this use case.
The top three use cases are central to SOC operations. Net-
work detection (93% of respondents mentioned this) is still
the main use of threat intelligence. This includes all instances
in which TI is used to reduce attacker dwell time in an auto-
mated fashion, including correlating TI to logs, ingesting it
in a SIEM or IDS, or using it in host-based detection controls.
Situational awareness was mentioned in two out of three
interviews (64%) as a use case. This is the ability of TI or
SOC analysts to have a general understanding of their orga-
nization’s threat environment and risk proﬁle. Situational

Improving end user awareness (29%) is about using TI
to educate the wider employee population of the organiza-
tion, e.g., security-awareness based on reports about recent
phishing campaigns.
Threat hunting (29%) is active investigation using TI.
This is the type of research which requires human creativity
and is currently hard to automate. Combining TI and other
data can generate insights for an analyst on where and how to
search for attacker activity in systems and networks.
Informing security engineering (21%) includes using TI
to organize vulnerability management as part of maintaining
the organizations own systems. It also includes the prioritiza-
tion of developer tasks, e.g., on a customer-facing app, based
on observed attacker tactics.
Reducing ﬁnancial fraud (14%) is a speciﬁc use case for
banks. Their PTI vendors are supplying them with lists of
compromised credit cards. Based on this data, they can decide
to block cards or investigate accounts for money laundering.
A Team Lead TI at a bank shared: “We are not in a position
to buy something from dark web criminals, but [the PTI
vendors] are.”
7.2 Value perception of TI
Prior work has assumed that users would like to evaluate TI
based on quality criteria such as volume, overlap, timeliness,
accuracy, and coverage [21, 33], as discussed in Section 2.
The assumption is that those criteria capture what users value.
Rather than work from this assumption, we have followed an
inductive approach. When our respondents made evaluating
comments about TI, we labelled them. This resulted in wider
set of 16 separate codes of the properties that made TI to be
perceived as more valuable. We describe these labels, printed
here in italics, and list them in Table 6 in Appendix B.
First of all, only three respondents (21%) mentioned any-
thing about price or affordability. If price is not a key factor,
this begs the question: what is? We distinguished three clus-
ters of values: conﬁdence, relevance and actionability.
Conﬁdence relates to how much the user trusts the TI to
provide useful results. This was primarily interpreted by re-
spondents as not wasting the time of analysts. A head of SOC
at an ISP described: “One of our commercial sources actually
even has a negative value for us, because it costs us time to
look into alarms that it generates, which turn out to be mostly
false positives.” Most of our respondents desire low ‘noise’
in the TI they receive, which we labeled as to automatabil-
ity (79% of respondents named this property). Loaded into
systems such as ﬁrewalls or IDSes, low-quality information
will immediately have drastic operational impacts. Closely
related to automating is the use of TI is trust in the vendor. A
head of SOC at an ISP described wanting to be able to ver-
ify the origin of intelligence they receive, or what one might
call the vendor’s transparency: “For us, a provider’s ability
to answer questions about their intel is an indication of the
conﬁdence we can place in them. Of course I understand if
they sometimes cannot name their sources. But we need some
understanding of the process that led to an indicator being
placed on a list in order to use it.” Respondents perceive a
source as more valuable if it providers an original contribu-
tion (50%), as demonstrated by this quote by a head of SOC:
“We notice a lot of re-use between providers and people in
the community. As a rule, we prefer original intelligence over
curated or aggregated intelligence because you can cut out
the middleman and directly ask questions about the assess-
ment or provide feedback on the intelligence.” Conﬁdence is
evidently related to accuracy (43%) of TI, but respondents
also mentioned selectiveness (29%). As at analyst at a bank
told us: “From [this trusted community] we get emails so
often that we ﬁlter and tend to ignore them. Whereas [another
source] only emails us twice per year. In that case we are
likely to look into it.” Selectiveness indicates a preference for
a low volume, which is seen as an indication of accuracy.
These perception of value reﬂect an intriguing implicit
trade-off that users are making; smaller, more curated TI
sources are valued higher, as these require fewer organiza-
tional resources and may prevent information overload for
analysts [4]. But they also imply more false negatives – some-
thing our analysis of the overlap of sources (Section 5) has
conﬁrmed. The risk of having high false negative rates was,
remarkably, much less of a worry.
The second cluster of properties perceived as valuable is
on relevance. Here, we ﬁnd properties that value the degree
in which the TI is tuned to the speciﬁc situation of the orga-
nization. Two respondents mentioned ending a contract with
a PTI vendor because their intelligence mostly covered a sec-
tor (64%) not relevant to them. Geographic focus (50%) is a
valued property because our respondents seem to understand
attacker groups to choose targets based on earlier successful
campaigns in a given country. Furthermore, a certain bias may
be related to the geographic focus, as a respondent in Japan
described the market for PTI as too US-centric, with certain
information not being usable for their organization. A Team
Lead TI at an oil and gas company warned: “Be aware of bi-
ases of your intelligence providers. For example, a US-based
provider will never report on US spying activities.” Hence,
coverage of one source may have the ability to correct bias
(14%) in another. Coverage of relevant threats (50%) was
mentioned by respondents, but not in terms of if the indicator
feeds exhaustively contained all the relevant infrastructure
of the relevant threat groups. Rather, respondents seemed to
interpret this in terms of coverage of their threat landscape, i.e.
providing information about threats relevant for their organi-
zation. A Team Lead TI at a bank explained how at one point
they were confronted with an advanced threat actor. They
then separately asked four PTI vendors to tell them what they
knew about this threat actor and validated this with their own
USENIX Association

observations. They noted: “One vendor had nothing, the other
three came with a theory. Based on the data that we could
observe ourselves, we saw that [vendor X] was totally wrong.
The other two vendors were right. It might have been a coin-
cidence, but we did this a few more times and then decided to
work with those two vendors.” Again, these value perceptions
reﬂect a way of thinking that aims to reduce impact of TI on
analysts, in this case by valuing TI that reduces the inputs
into the workﬂow to what is considered the most relevant.
Finally, there is a cluster of values around actionability.
This was deﬁned by a Team Lead TI at a bank as: “intelli-
gence which you can use to inﬂuence your business.” The
capability to provide context (100%) means that TI helps
the user to understand and explain events and alerts. Paid
sources are seen by respondents as better at providing con-
text than open sources. One analyst from the Netherlands
said: “Intelligence is about context, about putting threats into
perspective for your organization.” Timeliness of TI (50%)
is a valued property because indicators lose their relevance
rapidly. Once TI is outdated, it is no longer actionable. In
Section 6, we compared the timeliness of OTI and PTI and
did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference. This was consistent with
the remarks of our respondents. Some said that they do see
a difference with STI: they receive certain TI earlier from
trusted communities. Yet, even timely TI is only actionable if
it is comprehensive (50%) enough to be able to base decisions
on it, such as suggesting possible mitigation strategies. Some
respondents spoke about ‘rich’ information and about the
difference between ‘raw’ vs. ‘polished’ intelligence, where
PTI is deemed of higher quality because it is more polished
towards use. An analyst as a bank stated: “A [colleague] at
another bank is just going to post some IOCs to you, or it
will be a small write-up, because their time is limited. It will
not be of the same quality [as that of PTI providers]. That’s
the key difference: you’re paying for polished intel rather
than what we would call raw intel.” Interpretability (50%)
refers to the property that the analyst can make sense of the
information, e.g., it has good meta-data. Data visualisation
(14%) is related property that aids in putting the TI to use by
making it accessible.
In sum, we ﬁnd that TI is evaluated on a much broader
set of criteria than prior work assumed. Furthermore, an
underlying logic in the properties that respondents value is
that they are optimizing the workﬂow of their organization
– most notably their analysts – rather than the detection of
threats. This is one of the key reasons why they value the
smaller and more curated PTI sources. The fact that these
smaller sources might have limited coverage and uncertain
timeliness (Section 5 & 6) is not described as a major problem.
7.3 Evaluating TI
Customers of TI found it difﬁcult to compare sources, which
corroborates ﬁndings in market research [20, 14]. Evaluation
happens mostly in informal processes and based on tacit cri-
teria and heuristics. One research manager described: “So
far, we don’t have any kind of scientiﬁc evaluation process
or method. Just a feeling of the analysts. They are using the
threat intel daily, and they can feel if they are comfortable with
it.” Six out of fourteen respondents did deﬁne some criteria
or intelligence requirements in order to evaluate TI sources,
often in the form of information gaps in the organization –
i.e., what questions the TI team needed to answer.
One analyst described using metrics within the network
detection use case: “You can [demonstrate the effectiveness]
by generating a metric on IOC feeds. For example, how
many times does this commercial IOC feed purchased from
[vendor X] create security events within our organization?
And then, what is the outcome of those security events? Is
it a false positive? In which case, that means that IOCs sent
by that vendor are inaccurate. We can feed that back to the
vendor when it comes that negotiation about the contract.”
On calculating metrics for the use case of informing business
decisions, he added: “That’s slightly more difﬁcult to develop
metrics around and quantify. But really, what we’re looking
for from stakeholders [in our organization] is very simple
feedback: Was this useful? Did this aid your decision? [...]
That is good enough to say if [my team’s] reporting is having
an impact.”
8 DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have attempted to lift the veil of paid TI
services. We conﬁrm that, indeed, paid TI seems to be a
different cup of tea, with distinct intelligence products and low
overlap with open TI sources. The interviews we conducted
display an apparent contradiction in the practice of TI use:
professionals discuss at length the properties that they believe
make TI valuable to them, yet hardly attempt to measure or
validate these beliefs.
This contradiction questions if threat intelligence metrics,
as proposed by [21] and others, can actually capture the right
value properties. Research has focused on developing metrics
that could be used to understand the coverage, accuracy and
timeliness that PTI providers can provide. In our interviews
we found, however, that customers are much more pragmatic
in how they evaluate the added value of TI, namely through
the impact it has on their analysts and security operations. To
optimize the analysts’ workﬂow, poor coverage is not neces-
sarily a big problem, while the number of alerts is. This drives
customers to smaller, curated sets – the opposite direction of
where a coverage metric would point them. In detection par-
lance: one might expect customers of PTI to select sources
for low false negatives, while actually they seem to be select-
ing for low false positives. These are two distinct goals that
are both part of the concept of accuracy. Another limitation
of these metrics is that although quantiﬁcation make sense
for network detection – events can be measured – it make

described. Thoughtfully composed threat actor reports do
not lend themselves to quantitative analysis. Further, just
counting network events does not tell much about organiza-
tional outcomes: an event may occur without it having much
relevance or impact. Analyst skill and experience therefore
remain essential for triage in the SOC [4]. Carefully prepared
analysis reports could contribute to answering strategic ques-
