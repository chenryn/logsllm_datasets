I understand that you are experiencing an issue with Python 2.7 and `tornado` in a virtual environment on a Unix server where you do not have root access. Here is a more refined and professional version of your text:

**Issue Description:**

I am running Python 2.7 within a virtual environment (using `virtualenv`) on a Unix server, where I do not have root access. I recently upgraded the `tornado` module to version 4.0 using the command `pip install tornado --upgrade` because `ipython` requires `tornado >= 3.1.0`, but the default version installed on the server was 2.4.

Despite the successful upgrade, when I attempt to launch `ipython`, it still reports that the required version of `tornado` is not available. I have verified that `ipython` is correctly aliased to the virtual environment, and the upgrade did indeed install `tornado` version 4.0 in the `site-packages` directory of the virtual environment.

However, when I start Python (also correctly aliased to the virtual environment) and import `tornado`, it loads the older version (2.4) instead of the updated version from the virtual environment. Importing other packages that were only installed in the virtual environment works as expected.

**Attempts to Resolve:**

- I tried appending the following line to my virtual environment's `activate` file:
  ```sh
  PYTHONPATH=path_to_standardVE/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tornado:$PYTHONPATH
  ```
  This ensures that the path to the updated `tornado` package is at the front of the `PYTHONPATH`. However, even after this change, importing `tornado` in Python still loads the 2.4 version.

- I checked for the presence of `no-global-site-packages.txt` in the Python 2.7 directory, which indicates that the virtual environment should not inherit global site-packages. Additionally, the `orig-prefix.txt` file contains a parent directory outside the virtual environment, pointing to the location of the older `tornado` version.

**Questions:**

1. Could it be that the virtual environment is inheriting the global site-packages despite the `no-global-site-packages.txt` file?
2. Is there a way to address or test this setting now?

Thank you for your assistance!
