Motivation and Theme  
Unprecedented  levels  of  information  processing,  novel  architectural  solutions 
and a new realm of applications promise to be reached thanks to the advances 
in  semiconductor  technologies  for  integrating  extremely  large  numbers  of 
transistors  or  processing  elements  into  a  chip.  Towards  this  ends,  two  main 
tracks are being considered: 
•  "More  Moore": 
long  standing 
  Moore’s Law-based  trend  in  chip  development  that  aims  at  reducing  the  
  dimensions of silicon microelectronics. 
•  "Beyond  Moore":  this  track  features  atomic  assemblies  of  nanoscale  
include  nanowires,  carbon  nanotubes  or  organic  
  molecules,  etc.,  and  extend  also  to  quantum  computing,  optical  computing 
  and micro/nanofluidics.  
technologies; 
these 
this 
track 
is  pushing 
further 
the 
Due  to  the  differences  in  relative  advances  and  current  industrial  concerns 
attached  to  each  track,  the  Workshop  will  emphasize  the  top-down  track  for 
which such an evolution raises serious challenges both from the Dependability 
and  Security  viewpoints.  Nevertheless,  considerations  attached 
the 
emerging nanoscale technologies are also part of the scope of the Workshop. 
to 
In  both  cases,  it  is  expected  that  circuits  will  be  impaired  by  significant 
variations  affecting  process  parameters  and  thus  will  become  a  nightmare  to 
reliability  engineers  for  reaching  an  acceptable  manufacturing  yield  at  viable 
cost. The dramatic reduction of digital devices is accompanied by a decrease in 
power supply and threshold levels which in turn results in lower noise immunity 
and greater sensitivity to  particles.  Moreover,  additional instabilities  may affect 
circuit parameters in operation, e.g., NBTI in CMOS devices.  
Examples of vulnerabilities and malicious threats related to hardware chips are 
information  leakages  attached  to  side  channels  attacks  or  differential  fault 
analysis based on applying environmental  disturbances  or even fault injection. 
Potential  vulnerabilities  are  also  related  to  the  observability  and  controllability 
facilities provided by scan-based testing devices. 
Scope and Objectives  
The  Workshop  aims  at  addressing  these  impairments  and  threats  as  well  as 
distinguishing novel design approaches and operation paradigms that are to be 
enforced and/or favored to keep achieving dependable  and secure  computing. 
Three main goals are identified for the Workshop: 
•  Review  the  state-of-knowledge  about  the  main  threats  in  nanocomputing 
•  Report  on  existing solutions  and propose  new  design  options for  mitigating 
faults and implementing secure and resilient computing devices and systems. 
•  Forecast  the  risks  associated  to  emerging  technologies  and  foster  new  
technologies: manufacturing defects, accidental faults, malicious attacks. 
trends for cooperative work at technological and system levels.

Topics of Interest, Submission and Information  
The  Workshop  is  open  to  researchers,  designers  and  users  involved  with  or 
interested in dependability and security of hardware technologies. Submissions 
from industry and/or academia  on  all topics related  to  dependable  and secure  nanocomputing are  encouraged.  Potential topics of interest include, 
but are not limited to: emerging nanocomputing paradigms and models, failure modes and risk assessment, yield and mitigation techniques in nano-
scale  technologies,  on-line  adaptive  and  reconfigurable  nanoarchitectures,  design  techniques  for  developing  resilient  nanosystems,  fault-tolerant 
architectures specific to nanoscale circuits, scalable verification and testing methodologies, network on chip and communication protocols, etc.  
All prospective contributors should submit an extended abstract, work-in-progress report or position paper. Submissions must be original work with 
no substantial overlap with previously published papers or simultaneous submissions to a journal or conference with proceedings. The submissions 
should  conform  to  the  proceedings  publication  format  (IEEE  Conference  style)  and  should  not  exceed  six  pages  (including  all  text,  references, 
appendices, and figures). They should explain the contribution to the field and the novelty of the work, making clear the current status of the work. 
Each submission should start with a title, a short abstract, and names and contact information of the authors. Submissions will be fully refereed by 
three PC members. Submissions must be made electronically (in PDF format), preferably via the Workshop Webpage (www.laas.fr/WDSN09). 
Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the Workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the supplement 
volume of the DSN 2009 proceedings. 
About IOLTS and DSN: In 2009, IOLTS and DSN will be held back to back in geographically close sites in Lisbon area (IOLTS finishing two days 
before  WDSN09).  IOLTS  and  WDSN  cover  technically  close,  though  complementary,  domains.  This  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  interested 
participants  attending  both  events  to  benefit  from  a  comprehensive  coverage  of  topics  related  to  dependable  and  secure  computing  and  critical 
applications,  spanning  technology  level,  gate-level  and  RTL  level  issues,  analysis  and  assessment  techniques  as  well  as  architectures 
encompassing also software and system levels. For more information about IOLTS, see: www-tima.imag.fr/conferences/iolts/iolts09
