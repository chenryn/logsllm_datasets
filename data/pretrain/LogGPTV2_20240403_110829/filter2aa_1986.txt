## Why Hack a Wind Farm?
- **Wind Energy**: 
  - It is becoming the predominant source of renewable energy.
  - In 2015, it generated 4.7% of electricity in the United States.
  - By 2030, it is expected to contribute up to 20%.
- **Increased Reliance and Vulnerability**:
  - As reliance on wind energy grows, so does the attention from potential attackers.
  - Modern wind farms are operated by computerized control systems and networks.
- **Importance**:
  - Mechanical failures can be induced by targeting insecure control networks.
  - Preventing attackers from turning these peaceful systems into targets for ransomware or causing catastrophic damage is crucial.

## What is a Wind Farm?
- A power plant that converts wind into electricity.
- **Components**:
  - **Wind Turbines**: Generate energy from wind.
  - **Substations**: Collect and distribute the generated energy to the power grid.
  - **SCADA Systems/Networks**: Control the turbines and substations, integrating industrial control systems (ICS) and IT.
  - **IEC-61400-* Specifications**: Define design, operations, and communication requirements.

## Wind Farm Case Study
- **Exclusive Access**: 
  - Five U.S. based wind farms with over 1,000 turbines.
  - Multiple equipment models from five major vendors.
- **Research Duration**: Nearly two years.
- **Assessment Scope**: 
  - Control systems, networks, IT systems, and physical security.
  - Insights into vendor implementation and configuration practices.

## Red Teaming a Wind Farm
- **Red Teaming at Over 300 Feet**:
  - Evaluating communications infrastructure and control networks.

## Wind Turbine Anatomy
- **Nacelle**: Houses the generator and other critical components.
- **Turbine**: Converts wind energy into mechanical energy.
- **Control Network**: Manages the operation and monitoring of the turbines.

## Overview of Vulnerabilities
- **Common Issues**:
  - No authentication or encryption of control messages.
  - Use of insecure remote management services (e.g., Telnet, FTP, SNMP).
  - Easily guessable or default passwords.
  - Lack of network segmentation between turbines.
  - Weak physical security.
- **Expected Findings**: Typical for industrial control systems (ICS).

## IEC-61400-25
- **Communication Requirements**:
  - Defines uniform communication standards for wind power plants.
  - Supports various protocols, including Web services, DNP3, OPC XML-DA, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850-8-1 MMS.

## OPC (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control)
- **Overview**:
  - First released in 1996 to standardize PLC-specific protocols.
  - Variants include OPC UA, OPC XML, and OPC XML-DA.
  - Used for real-time data exchange, monitoring, and control value updates.
  - Client/server architecture: clients issue requests, servers translate them into field bus commands.

## OPC XML-DA Specification
- **Data Exchange**:
  - Uses SOAP (HTTP, XML) for data exchange.
  - Message services include status, read, write, subscription, browse, and get properties.
- **Implementation Issues**:
  - Messages are often sent in plain text.
  - Relying on vendors to add encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) is problematic.

## Example OPC-XML-DA Requests
- **Read Requests**:
  - Wind speed, break status, rotor pitch angle, power production, rotor RPM, nacelle direction, ambient temperature, and operating status of CANopen controllers.
- **Write Requests**:
  - Operating state (on/off), emergency shutdown, maximum power generation output, nacelle pitch or yaw.

## Wind Farm Control Network Access Vectors
- **Access Methods**:
  - Physical access to turbines or substations.
  - Compromised vendor networks or supply chains.
  - Attaching rogue devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi with cellular or Wi-Fi module) to ICS switches.

## Building Blocks for Wind Farm Security Assessment Tools
- **Tools Developed**:
  - To attack IEC-61400-25 protocols and network services.
  - Reverse engineering command-and-control protocols using Tcpdump/Wireshark and Scapy.
  - Utilizing Raspberry Pi 3 with Python 2.7, Bash, Scapy, Nmap, and Iptables.

## Wind Farm Attacks
- **Hijack Control**:
  - Scan for OPC servers and fabricate/replay OPC XML-DA write messages.
- **Damage Turbines**:
  - Systematically target key mechanical components to increase failure rates.
- **Disrupt and Damage**:
  - ARP cache poisoning, intercepting, blocking, modifying, and fabricating OPC messages to mislead SCADA operators.

## Windworm
- **Targeting PACs**:
  - Cross-compile malware for embedded platforms.
  - Propagate via FTP and execute via Telnet.
  - Leverage weak/default passwords and modify critical process control variables.

## CANopen
- **Industrial Automation**:
  - Commonly used in control systems.
  - Remotely accessible data structure (object dictionary) for configuration and communication.
  - Protocols include PDO for real-time data and SDO for setting and reading values.

## Windransom Scenario
- **Goal**:
  - Paralyze wind farm operations unless a ransom is paid in Bitcoin.
- **Impact**:
  - Financial cost due to downtime, calculated based on capacity and energy prices.

## Potential Impact of Downtime
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - Assuming 100% dependence on wind energy and a 35% capacity factor.
  - Example: 250 MW wind farm with 167 x 1.5 MW turbines.
  - Revenue loss per hour, day, week, and month of downtime.

## Recovery from Malware Outbreak
- **Challenges**:
  - Reimaging systems and replacing hardware are costly and time-consuming.
  - Ensuring complete remediation and preventing recurrence.
- **Financial Consequences**:
  - Operators lose the ability to produce energy, leading to financial losses.

## Key Takeaways and Conclusions
- **Vulnerability**:
  - Wind farm control networks are highly susceptible to attacks.
- **Proactive Measures**:
  - Verify and retrofit security measures.
  - Implement network isolation with inline firewalls and encrypted VPN tunnels.
- **Call to Action**:
  - Secure wind farm control networks proactively.
