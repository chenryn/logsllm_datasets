### Abstract
In an end-to-end encryption model for a wireless sensor network (WSN), the network control center preloads encryption and decryption keys to the sensor nodes and subscribers, respectively, allowing a subscriber to use a mobile device in the deployment field to decrypt the data encrypted by resource-constrained sensor nodes. This paper introduces SMS-SED, a provably secure and efficient key assignment system with discrete time-based access control. SMS-SED supports a business model where the WSN is rented to customers who require flexible subscription periods beyond strictly consecutive ones. In SMS-SED, both nodes and mobile devices store secret keys whose size is independent of the total number of sensor nodes and time periods. We evaluated the feasibility of deploying 2000 nodes for 4096 time periods at 1024-bit security, studied the trade-off between increasing node storage and reducing computation time, and provided formal security arguments in the random oracle model.

## 1. Introduction

A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a large-scale, self-organized network consisting of low-cost, resource-constrained sensor nodes that monitor ambient environments in a deployment field. The sensor nodes send wirelessly obtained data (typically sensor readings) to a base station, which processes the data and forwards the results to a control center for decision-making. In some scenarios, the base station and control center may be implemented on the same physical server, which handles user authentication and operational management.

### 1.1 Motivation

We envision a business model where a network provider deploys sensor nodes and rents the WSN to commercial customers. The WSN is provided as an infrastructure service, and users subscribe to the service for data acquisition without deploying their own nodes. Each sensor node can provide multiple types of data services (e.g., temperature, pressure, and humidity reports), and users can subscribe to various combinations of these services. For simplicity, we focus on a single data service, but our solution can be extended to multi-service scenarios and adapted to other applications such as vehicle self-navigation and military uses. Data are collected by mobile units (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) that access the sensor network at unpredictable locations.

For the benefit of the network provider, a commercially viable data provision service requires access control to ensure that users can only acquire the data they are entitled to based on their subscription. Subscriptions are typically managed on a time basis, with users charged daily or per hour. Research from NYU and MIT suggests that content bundling and fixed fees can generate greater profits, motivating a subscription-based business model.

### 1.2 Sensor Network Data Encryption Models

To ensure data confidentiality, sensor nodes should encrypt the obtained data before transmission. Symmetric-key cryptography is commonly used, where the same key is employed for both encryption and decryption. There are two main encryption models:

- **Hop-by-hop encryption**: Each sensor node shares a pairwise key with its neighboring nodes within its communication range. Neighbor nodes decrypt, possibly aggregate, re-encrypt, and forward the data to the next hop.
- **End-to-end encryption**: Each sensor node holds one encryption key shared with the base station. The encrypted data can only be decrypted by the base station, while neighbor nodes propagate the data in encrypted form.

The end-to-end encryption model ensures data confidentiality even if some sensor nodes are untrustworthy. It also allows authorized mobile users to directly access localized data at any sensor node, as long as they hold the respective decryption keys.

### 1.3 Time-based Access Control

Time-based access control can be implemented using time-bound key assignment. Each sensor node encrypts the data with a time-variant session key. Different nodes use different session keys even in the same time period, assuming synchronized sensor nodes. Users register at the WSN control center to subscribe to a set of time periods. At any discrete time within their subscription, users can access the sensed data directly from the sensor nodes.

A straightforward implementation would involve creating and managing a large number of keys, which is impractical due to storage and cost issues. Instead, we propose a "two-dimensional" time-based key management scheme. The control center issues a node key \( k_{i,*} \) to each node \( i \) and a user key \( k_{*,J} \) to a user who subscribes to the set of time periods \( J \). A time-variant session key \( k_{i,j} \) can be computed by the node using \( k_{i,*} \) or by the user using \( k_{*,J} \) if \( j \in J \).

### 1.4 Our Contribution

#### 1.4.1 Generalized Time-Based Access Control

We assume the subscription time is divided into equal units (time periods). Our system allows users to subscribe to any arbitrary set of these time periods, providing flexibility not found in existing time-bound access control techniques, which only allow consecutive time periods.

#### 1.4.2 Provable Security Guarantee

Our system addresses the challenge of collusion between corrupted sensor nodes and malicious mobile users. Even if an adversary captures up to \( t \) sensor nodes and acquires many user keys, the system remains secure. We define security with respect to a threshold \( t \), ensuring the system remains secure as long as no more than \( t \) nodes are compromised.

#### 1.4.3 Design Principles

Our scheme borrows ideas from the broadcast key assignment protocol by Benaloh and de Mare. We aim to make the common case (node key derivation) fast and shift the computational burden to the mobile user. The user key derivation involves interpolation of \( t \) elements, making the overall system more efficient.

#### 1.4.4 Symmetric Key Aggregation

SMS-SED provides a mechanism to aggregate many symmetric keys. The size of the node key \( k_{i,*} \) and the user key \( k_{*,J} \) is independent of the total number of sensor nodes and time periods. Using symmetric keys, we achieve confidentiality and authenticity with minimal overhead.
