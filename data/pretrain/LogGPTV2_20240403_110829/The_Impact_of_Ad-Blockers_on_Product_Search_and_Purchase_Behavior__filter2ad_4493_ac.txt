4 Results
Before the experiment, we obtained IRB approval and partici-
pants’ consent. Over the course of 4 months, 212 individuals
participated in the experiment in labs at Carnegie Mellon
University (CMU). We recruited participants using the CMU
Center of Behavioral Decision Research’s participant pool,
Craigslist, and ﬂyers on CMU campus. Participants were
grouped into sessions. There were up to ﬁve participants per
session, each of whom was randomly assigned to one of the
two conditions. Group composition was balanced by gender,
with 52% female. Average age of the participants was 26
years old (SD = 10;min = 18;max = 72) and included stu-
dent and non-student population. The majority (59%) had a
Bachelor’s degree or higher.11 About half (49%) speciﬁed
their ethnicity as Asian (of these, 31% have resided in the US
for most of their lives) and 36% as White.12
Regarding the perceived role of online advertising (see sup-
plemental material S3), the majority of participants agreed
that it is distracting (77%) and intrusive (67%), and 46% found
it disturbing. On the other hand, many participants agreed that
it creates brand awareness (80%) (although only 37% believe
it eventually persuades to buy the products), is informative
about the available products, their prices, or discounts (62%),
and is necessary to enjoy free services on the Internet (58%).
Less than half agreed that online advertising helps to ﬁnd
products and services that match one’s personality and in-
terests (48%), raising doubts about the perceived beneﬁts of
targeted ads. Only about a third of participants agreed that
online advertising saves money (33%), time (32%), or helps
to buy the best product for a given price (32%).
Our participants chose 53% of the products for purchase
from Amazon.com, and 14% of the products from Wal-
mart.com. The rest of the products were chosen from a long
tail of 73 other websites (with individual frequency of no
more than 5.1%), including popular US retailers (such as
Ebay.com, Aliexpress.com, BestBuy.com, Target.com), spe-
ciﬁc brand vendors’ websites (e.g., Zara.com, Ikea.com), and
less popular online vendors (e.g., candle-licious.com).
In NoBlock condition, products chosen from the sponsored
Google Shopping listings were primarily from Walmart.com
(25%), Bestbuy.com (20%), and Target.com (10%), and only
1% from Amazon.com. Among the products chosen from
the sponsored links, 72% were from Amazon.com. Moreover,
there is no difference in website and brand familiarity be-
tween products chosen from organic and sponsored links, but
participants were less familiar with the websites (β = −1.2,
p = 0.000) and more familiar with the brands (β = 0.45,
11This is in line with the fact that people with higher education are more
likely to use the Internet[3].
12The racial distribution is not representative of the US popula-
tion as a whole, but reﬂects the considerable presence of Asian stu-
dents enrolled at the institution where the study was conducted in
2016: 26.2% White, 17.7% Asian (https://datausa.io/profile/
university/carnegiemellon-university/).
p = 0.008) of the products in sponsored Google Shopping
listings than in organic links.
Note that our manipulation affected the entire product op-
tion space available to participants (through fetching or block-
ing sponsored search results), and, in turn, participants’ actual
purchase behavior (e.g., through a potential change of refer-
ence point). For instance, if the product prices are lower in
sponsored search results than in organic search results, then
participants in the NoBlock condition will have a wider prod-
uct option space with access to lower prices than participants
in the Block condition, which could change their reference
price, even if they eventually do not buy those lower priced
advertised products. Similarly, the exposure to luxury brand
products in sponsored search results and display ads could
alter the expectations of participants in the NoBlock condition
about appropriate product quality, and drive their satisfaction
down compared to subjects in the Block condition, who have
not seen those ads. If the reverse held, higher prices or lower
quality of advertised products compared to organic search
results would result in opposite predictions. Finally, exposure
to ads, on the one hand, may provide a short cut by efﬁciently
matching buyers to the sellers’ offers that would satisfy con-
sumer needs and thus save time on searching; and on the
other hand, it may distract participants’ attention, increasing
their product search time. In this manuscript, we do not focus
on price differences across all organic vs. sponsored search
results and ads. Instead, we focus on analyzing participants’
potential changes in search behaviors and subsequent product
choices.
4.1 Effect on Prices
For most product categories, the average price of the cho-
sen items did not signiﬁcantly differ between the two condi-
tions (Table 2). Only in the Book category did participants in
the Block condition select products with signiﬁcantly lower
average prices than participants in the NoBlock condition
(t(150) = 1.98, p = 0.049). Additionally, on average, and for
three speciﬁc products—Winter hat, Headphones, and Key
chains—the variance was signiﬁcantly larger in the Block
condition than in the NoBlock condition. This may suggest
an “anchoring effect”: sponsored Google Shopping listings
that contain prices and are shown at the very top of the search
engine result page may have triggered participants to rely
on this initial piece of information as a reference point in
their subsequent product search. We plan to investigate this
phenomenon in our future work.
In the NoBlock condition, participants clicked on spon-
sored search results and chose the products for purchase from
them quite often (Table 3). ANOVA suggests that the prices
of the chosen products that originated from the top sponsored
links (β = 2.84, p = 0.01) were higher than the ones originat-
ing from organic links. In contrast, the prices of the products
chosen following sponsored Google Shopping listings were

4.2 Effect on Search Time
During the 40-minute-long experiment, participants man-
aged to search on average for 8 out of the 10 products in
both conditions and spent about 4 minutes searching per
product (sd = 3.57,min = 0,max = 32). Subjects spent less
time (t(1682) = 10.41, p = 0.00) and inspected slightly more
search results (t(1682) = −6.33, p = 0.00) when searching
speciﬁc branded products compared to generic ones.
Participants who chose the products from sponsored
Google Shopping listings spent less time on their searching
(ANOVA: beta = −1.64, p = 0.00) than those who chose the
products following organic links (Table 4).
According to the results of regression analysis (Table 3
in S5) and statistical tests, the absence of ads did not sub-
stantially increase or decrease the search costs for partic-
ipants: across conditions the difference in product search
time (t(1682) = −0.8502, p = 0.3953) and total number
of inspected search results (mean = 2.39,sd = 1.83,min =
1,max = 19,t(1682) = 0.24, p = 0.81) was not statistically
signiﬁcant.
The usage of ad-blockers on home computers did not sig-
niﬁcantly affect the search time (t(1682) = −0.86, p = 0.39),
but users of ad-blocker on home computers inspected slightly
more search results (t(1682) = −2.34, p = 0.02).
Statistically signiﬁcant and negative order effect suggests
that closer to the end of the experiment participants were
