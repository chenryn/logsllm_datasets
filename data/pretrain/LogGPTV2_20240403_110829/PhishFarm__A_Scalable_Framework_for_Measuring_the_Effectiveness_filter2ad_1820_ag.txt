APPENDIX III: CRAWLER TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
Our 2,380 phishing sites logged a total of 2,048,606 HTTP
requests originating from 100,959 distinct IP addresses. A sub-
stantial proportion of requests was characterized by crawlers
scanning for phishing kit archives (i.e. zip ﬁles) or credential
dump ﬁles; such requests resulted in 404 “not found” errors. It
is beneﬁcial for the security community to be able to identify
compromised user information and study phishing kits [8],
[10], but such crawling is noisy. By monitoring trafﬁc to
their phishing sites, cybercriminals could become aware of the
ecosystem’s knowledge of their tools, and adapt accordingly.
Figure 6 aggregates the web trafﬁc to all phishing sites
from the full tests over the course of a 2-week period rel-
ative to initial deployment (along a logarithmic scale). Not
unexpectedly, we observed the largest amount of trafﬁc in the
hours immediately after reporting each phishing site. Smaller
spikes occurred several hours or days thereafter as additional
infrastructure started accessing the sites. We automatically
disabled each site at
the end of its 72-hour deployment;
crawlers would thus start seeing 404 errors thereafter. We
observed a spike in trafﬁc at this point with characteristics
similar to the initial crawler trafﬁc, followed by an immediate
sharp decline (presumably once the ofﬂine state of each site
was veriﬁed). Over the following seven days, we logged a
consistent yet slowly-declining level of trafﬁc. It is clear that
an effort is being made to ensure that ofﬂine phishing content
does not make a return. After about 10 days, we saw a second
sharp decline, after which the trafﬁc reached insigniﬁcant
levels. We did not study blacklist warning persistence across
browsers; this could be an interesting area to explore in the
future.
1) Geographical Origin: Using the GeoLite2 IP database,
we found that trafﬁc to our phishing sites originated from
113 different countries across the majority of North America,
Europe, and Asia, and some of Africa, as shown in Table IX.
79.02% of all unique IP addresses were based in the US; this
accounted for a slightly lower 64.73% of all trafﬁc but still
constituted an overwhelming majority overall.
2) Entity Crawler Overlap: We provide a summary of IP
address overlap between entities in Table X. The data is in-
dicative of collaboration between certain entities, as discussed
in Section VI-B5. A per-entity analysis of long-term crawler
trafﬁc is outside the scope of this work.
