User: I normally code admin scripts in Python and I know of many that code them in Perl. I was about to invest some time on improving my skills on bash programming. But I wonder if people around think that this is a good idea ? 
I know bash is a good skill to have and market very often demand it but ... if I can get by with Python or Perl then ... is it really worth the effort ?
As answers I am looking for cases where actually bash is way better than Perl or Python to develop admin scripts.
Assistant: I'd say if this is only your machine and you're not supposed to share those administration scripts with any other one, so you'd better to keep doing that in Python (which seems you feel more comfortable on that).
But if you have colleagues or your admin scripts are supposed to employee by other people, so let keep it in a way that is more popular and more understandable for others also: Bash!
Also I guess if you know Bash, you can simply use dozens of existing Bash scripts by customizing them or improving them to whatever which is more suitable for you!
