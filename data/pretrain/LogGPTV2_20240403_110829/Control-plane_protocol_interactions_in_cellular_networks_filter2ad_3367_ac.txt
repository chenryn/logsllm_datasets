data sessions when user devices switch between 3G and 4G. They
thus share contexts in 3G and 4G. However, 4G mandates such
shared states but 3G may have deleted them, thus causing state re-
covery failure after successful inter-system handover.
5.1.1
The inter-system switch is commonly observed between 3G and
4G in practice. It occurs in three popular usage settings. First, in
hybrid 3G/4G deployment, the mobile user leaves the coverage of
current system, enters the cell of another system, and then roams
back to the old system. Second, a user makes a CSFB-based call
in 4G LTE networks, which triggers two handoffs, i.e., one from
4G to 3G to start the voice call in 3G, and one from 3G to 4G
after the call completes. Third, carriers may initiate such switching
for users for load balancing or better resource availability. In case
PS data access is enabled (when the mobile data network is ON),
a 3G↔4G information migration will be performed accordingly.
Note that, critical information and states are stored in PDP or EPS
bearer context in 3G or 4G before the switching. To ensure smooth
migration, the PDP context in 3G and the EPS bearer context in
4G are translated and kept consistent. For example, the IP address,
etc.. remains the same before and after the switching.
Figure 3 shows how signaling protocols interact during 4G→3G
switching4 [4]. There are three steps. First, 4G RRC at the de-
vice receives the command from the 4G base station, disconnects
the RRC connection between the device and the base station, and
informs EMM. Second, 3G RRC at the device connects to the 3G
base station using the information carried in the above command.
It informs MM and GMM of such an inter-system switching for
both CS and PS domains. MM and GMM subsequently initiate the
location update procedure in both 3G CS and PS domains. If any
data service was initiated when the device was in 4G, the gateways
and MME (in Figure 1) collaborate to transfer the 4G EPS bearer
4The scenario shown here is “RRC connection release with redi-
rect”, which is a typical inter-system switching mechanism.

context into the 3G PDP context during the location update proce-
dure. After the conversion, the resources reserved for the 4G EPS
bearer will be released. Third, MM/GMM in 3G informs EMM in
4G regarding the successful switching. The procedure for 3G→4G
switching is similar. The 3G PDP context is migrated to the 4G
EPS bearer context during the location update performed in 4G.
5.1.2
In the instance S1, our tool reports that the above protocols vi-
olate the property of PacketService_OK. We ﬁnd that the user be-
comes out-of-service after an inter-system switching.
The scenario is as follows. The user device is initially in 4G
and has its EPS bearer context activated. It then switches to 3G in
one of the three usage scenarios. The EPS bearer context is sub-
sequently deleted from 4G to release resource reservation. While
in 3G, the PDP context can also be deactivated for various reasons
(listed in Table 3). However, when later switching back to 4G, the
device cannot register to the 4G network, since 4G only supports
PS services and EPS bearer context is required. It detaches itself
and becomes out of service in 4G. We next understand the root
cause and the impact in three aspects.
We ﬁrst see why the PDP context is deleted in 3G. The EPS
bearer context or the PDP context is essential to enabling PS ser-
vices. Since 4G only supports PS, its EPS bearer context is manda-
tory for data service and signaling exchange. Whenever it cannot
be constructed, no service access is available based on the 4G stan-
dards [8]. On the other hand, the PDP context in 3G is allowed to
be deactivated. It is not mandatory in 3G. Since 3G supports both
CS and PS, a user can still use the CS voice service without the
PDP context. Deactivation of the PDP context is common in 3G.
Both the network and the user device can initiate it. It can also be
triggered by various reasons (listed in Table 3).
We next look into whether it is a serious issue and how bad its
negative impact is. Note that most smartphones do not support dual
radios for both 3G and 4G. Each phone thus access one network
at any time. Once being detached by 4G, the device has access
to neither 4G nor 3G. This can last a few seconds. Of course, the
device may immediately seek to re-register to 4G. It leaves the "out-
of-service" state once registration succeeds. Otherwise, it keeps
trying until the maximum retry count is reached. When all retries
fail, the device may start to try 3G.
We ﬁnally see whether the above problem can be eliminated.
The issue can be fully addressed since it stems from a design de-
fect. First, the 3G PDP context does not need to be deactivated in all
cases. Therefore, the 4G EPS bearer context can be re-constructed
and the device obtains data access after switching from 3G to 4G.
For example, the reason “QoS not accepted” in Table 3 states that
the QoS cannot be satisﬁed at the user device. If so, the PDP con-
text can be kept while changing to a lower QoS policy at the phone.
The factor “Incompatible PDP context” implies that the active PDP
context is not compatible for all PS services, e.g., MMS and In-
ternet. The PDP context can also be modiﬁed rather than being
deleted. The cause “Regular deactivation” is triggered by the user
(e.g., when turning off the mobile data) or by the network. The

PDP context can also be kept until the switching to 4G succeeds.
Second, even the PDP context has to be deactivated in 3G for com-
pelling reasons, the user device can still avoid out-of-service after
the inter-system switching. The reason is that, now the user device
is still in registered state in 4G, it can reactivate a EPS bearer rather
than being detached. This way, the device recovers from the PDP
context deactivation.
5.1.3 Experimental Validation
We next conduct experiments to validate and assess the above
issue. We run tests to switch phones between 3G and 4G networks
and collect protocol traces at the phone. The switching is done
through two methods: (1) by CSFB call, and (2) by driving back
and forth between two areas covered by 3G and 4G networks. We
verify the instance in both OP-I and OP-II in our tested phones.
When the device switches to 3G, the PDP context is deactivated by
the network. After migrating back to 4G, the phone is detached by
4G due to “No EPS Bearer Context Activated” error.
We also observe the same issue when users disable cellular data
services or switch to WiFi networks. For most smartphones, they
will disable the mobile data service whenever a local WiFi network
is accessible. While staying in 3G, some (here, HTC One and LG
Optimus G) deactivate all PDP contexts. As a result, when users
later switch to 4G, they become out of service for the same error.
We further observe an implementation issue that is complemen-
tary to S1. The tested phone may stay in the out-of-service state
longer than expected. When no PDP context is found during
switching to 4G, the phone does not detach immediately by fol-
lowing the 3GPP standards. Instead, it initiates the attach procedure
until receiving the message of location update reject from networks.
Note that it is not designed in 3GPP standards but observed in our
tested phones. Figure 4 plots the median, minimum and maximum
recovery time measured on Samsung S4 over more than 50 runs in
both carriers. The recovery time is the one from the time when the
tracking area update reject is received to the time when re-attach
succeeds. We see that the device takes 2.4s to 24.7s to complete
the attach procedure. Similar results are observed at other phones
(median gap < 0.5s). It is because the re-attach is mainly controlled
by operators. The phone is unreachable (i.e., out of service) during
the recovery time.
Insight 1: For the contexts shared between different systems, the
actions and policies shall be consistent across systems. Otherwise,
cross-system issues may arise.
5.2 Out-of-Sequenced Signaling in Inter-
The instance S2 appears during cross-layer protocol interactions
in 4G networks. The two involved protocols are EMM and RRC.
We ﬁnd that, the user device may temporarily be “out-of-service”
and lose 4G access. It is induced by the improper action taken by

EMM when communicating with RRC. The EMM protocol relies
on RRC to transfer signals, but assumes reliable, in-sequence sig-
naling messages. The underlying RRC protocol does not provide it.
Even worse, the design of EMM does not anticipate any lost or de-
layed signaling exchange. This leads to unexpected consequence.
The user is detached from 4G right after successful attach.
5.2.1
We ﬁnd that the above protocol interaction violates the property
of PacketService_OK. The device enters the “deregistered” state
(i.e., out of service in 4G), after receiving error signals of either
attach reject or location update reject. There are two cases.
The ﬁrst case happens when the
◦ Lost signaling messages.
attach request message is lost. Figure 5(a) plots the signaling se-
quence during the attach procedure. Initially, EMM at the device
sends an attach request to MME in the core network (Step 1), which
replies an attach accept (Step 2). The device establishes the EPS
bearer , and responds to MME with an attach complete signal (Step
3). However, this signal may be lost when invoking the RRC pro-
tocol for transmission to the base station, which further relays it to
MME. According to the standards [7], RRC does not always ensure
reliable delivery and the signal can be lost (e.g., over the air). Since
MME does not receive the attach complete message, inconsistent
EMM states exist between the device and MME.
On the user side, he believes the attach procedure succeeds,
while MME does not think so. Once the tracking area update (i.e.,
location update in 4G) is triggered , the problem worsens. During
this operation, the user sends the tracking area update request to
MME (Step 5). However, upon receiving it, the EMM protocol at
MME does not process it since it believes the attach procedure has
not completed yet. EMM thus rejects it with error type “implicitly
detach” and deregisters (i.e., detaches) the device from 4G, which
subsequently deletes the EPS bearer context. When receiving this
reject message, the user device has to detach itself from the network
after the prior attach success.
◦ Duplicate signaling messages. The second case is observed
when duplicate attach requests are received at MME (shown in Fig-
ure 5(b)). After sending the attach request (Step 1) through BS1,
the mobile user roams to BS2. However, BS1 is under heavy load
and defers the delivery of this signal to MME. Since it does not re-
ceive the reply message on time, the device retransmits the request
signal (Step 2) via BS2 and receives the attach accept from MME.
This completes the attach procedure at both the device and MME.
However, the duplicated attach request ﬁnally arrives at MME via
BS1. Given this duplicate signal, standards [8] stipulate that the
EPS bearer context is deleted and MME processes the duplicate
attach request. Two outcomes are possible. One is that the dupli-
cate request is rejected. The device becomes “out-of-service”. The
other is that it is accepted. The EPS bearer has to be re-constructed,
and packet service is unavailable during the transition.
The EMM protocol at MME seems to have valid reasons to take
above actions. Whenever it observes incomplete attach (in the ﬁrst
case), EMM has no reason to retain the EPS bearer context for the
device. When receiving a new attach request at the registered state
for the device, EMM has to reprocess it. Otherwise, it may lead
228to inconsistent states (i.e., registered or deregistered) at MME and
the user device. EMM indeed needs to reprocess the request to
resolve inconsistency in other settings. Assume that the device is
suddenly out of battery and cannot notify MME. MME still keeps
the device in the registered state, thus leading to inconsistency be-
tween the device and MME. When the device later powers on after
recharge and sends attach request to MME, EMM should process it
to recover consistency.
There are two causes rooted in improper cross-layer interaction.
First, EMM protocol itself is not prepared for out-of-sequenced sig-
naling exchange. It makes the assumption that the underlying pro-
tocols ensure reliable, in-sequence signal delivery. Its design does
not consider cases of lost and duplicate signals. Second, end-to-
end (i.e., from the device to MME through intermediate base sta-
tions) reliable delivery for signals is not readily ensured. This holds
true even when reliable delivery is assured between user device and
base station, as well as between the base station and MME. The ex-
ception arises during user mobility. Signals can be relayed by two
different base stations, and the signals may still lose their original
sequencing when arriving at MME.
5.2.2 Experimental Validation
In the experiments, we use three approaches to trigger the at-
tach/reattach procedure in 4G: (1) power on and off the 4G-only de-
vices, (2) manually change the network type between 3G-only and
4G-only on the device, and (3) reuse the experiments conducted in
§5.1. To make signals lost in the air, we conduct experiments in the
areas with weak signal coverage (i.e., RSSI is below -110dBm).
Our tests indeed show that EMM signaling messages are lost
when the radio transmission is bad. However, we do not observe the
implicit detach due to lost signals. The most common scenario we
observe is that user device keeps retransmitting the attach requests,
while no attach accept message is received. It is because cellular
networks are still closed systems, we are unable to drop or delay
speciﬁc EMM signals from 4G base stations/MME to validate this
design detect. In the future work, we plan to cooperate with opera-
tors to investigate network elements at the validation phase.
Insight 2: During cross-layer protocol interactions, the key func-
tionality of upper layer protocols should not merely rely on the non-
always-guaranteed features in lower layer protocols. Otherwise,
they are operating at the risk of failures.
5.3 Inconsistent Cross-Domain/Cross-System
The third instance S3 is both cross-domain (between 3G CS and
3G PS ) and cross-system (between 3G and 4G). We ﬁnd that, a 4G
user device may get stuck in 3G, thus losing its 4G connectivity and
high-speed access, after completing a CSFB voice call. This occurs
when the device still carries a high-rate data session, regardless of
whether the user is roaming or not. Note that this is against the
design of CSFB, which should move the device back to 4G after
the call. This scenario complements our recent study [27], which
only uncovers similar problems but when the device uses low-rate
data service. The root cause lies in inconsistent state transition for
the RRC protocol when handling both CS-domain voice and PS-
domain data in the process of inter-system switching.
5.3.1
Both instance S3 and that in [27] violate the property MM_OK
(i.e., inter-system mobility support). The device thus gets stuck in
3G, and cannot go back to 4G after the CSFB call. It happens when
a CSFB call has terminated. Speciﬁcally, when making the call, the
4G user switches to 3G but still uses data service in the PS domain.
Once the call completes, the device intends to switch back to 4G.
