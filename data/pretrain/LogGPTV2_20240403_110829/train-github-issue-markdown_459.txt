### Description
Currently, there is support only for one_success trigger_rule, which starts
the task instance the moment after one of the upstream tasks succeeds. The
idea for the new trigger_rule is to wait for all upstream tasks to be done and
at least one of them succeed.
### Use case/motivation
The use case is to allow a OR-like behavior to trigger_rules.  
Maybe even XOR-like behavior could be added as a second extra trigger_rule.
