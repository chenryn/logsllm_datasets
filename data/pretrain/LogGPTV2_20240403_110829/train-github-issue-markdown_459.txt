### Description
Currently, the system only supports the `one_success` trigger rule, which initiates a task instance immediately after any one of its upstream tasks succeeds. The proposed enhancement is to introduce a new trigger rule that waits for all upstream tasks to complete and ensures that at least one of them has succeeded before starting the downstream task.

### Use Case/Motivation
The primary use case for this new trigger rule is to enable an "OR-like" behavior, where a downstream task is triggered if any one of the upstream tasks succeeds. Additionally, it may be beneficial to introduce an "XOR-like" behavior as a secondary trigger rule, where the downstream task is triggered only if exactly one of the upstream tasks succeeds.
