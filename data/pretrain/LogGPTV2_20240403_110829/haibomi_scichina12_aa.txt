**Abstract**  
Localizing the primary cause of performance anomalies in cloud computing systems is challenging due to the complex interactions between components. The hidden connections within the vast number of request execution paths often contain valuable information for diagnosing such anomalies. We propose an approach to identify anomalous invoked methods and their physical locations by analyzing request trace logs. This approach involves two main steps: (1) clustering requests based on their call sequences, identifying anomalous requests using principal component analysis, and pinpointing anomalous methods with the Mann-Whitney hypothesis test; (2) comparing the behavior similarities of all replicated instances of the anomalous methods using Jensen-Shannon divergence and selecting those with distinct behaviors as the final culprits of the performance anomalies. Experiments conducted with four real-world cases at Alibaba Cloud Computing Inc. demonstrate that our approach can effectively locate the root causes of performance anomalies with low false-positive and false-negative rates.

### 1. Introduction

The continuous growth in the scale and complexity of software systems makes it increasingly difficult to ensure high-quality software [1–3]. Engineers often struggle to design sufficient test cases to cover all possible scenarios in production environments. Some bugs may only manifest under specific conditions, making it nearly impossible to deploy a completely bug-free system.

Performance anomalies are particularly challenging to diagnose compared to functional bugs, which typically cause system breakdowns [4]. Diagnosing performance issues is labor-intensive, especially in production environments.
