User: lets say that some files were renamed by Python script, is it possible to get this 'rename time' using Python (It can be seen in Far Manager)? (Windows)
It seems it is not possible through STAT, etc
Any ideas ?
Assistant: It is impossible, OS does not store such info about files. Answered by 'atzz' in comment
