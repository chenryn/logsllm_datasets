procurement, insurance, or peering requirement would require, and
thus far lacked, this measurement capability. We also validated use
of this platform to fill another gap: using stored measurements
to evaluate the likely effects of any deployed intervention over
time. More generally, this project has been a demonstration of the
the importance of measurement – science, infrastructure, and data
management – in developing and deploying practical solutions to
the Internet’s essential security weaknesses.

A PRIVATE NOTIFICATION
The Spoofer system automatically generated emails for individual
ASes using the following general format. The system tailored the
details of the notification to the AS using the evidence it had avail-
able. For example, it included a secret key in the URL so that the
contact could view results of inbound spoofing tests. We manually
sent each email to the abuse or other technical contact using the
real name and contact address of a representative of the project.

Subject: source IP address spoofing from 
While reviewing recent public tests from the CAIDA spoofer client
https://www.caida.org/projects/spoofer/
I came across one involving . It seems that based
on the testing history for AS, there is inadequate filtering of
IPv6 packets with invalid source addresses, so packets with spoofed
IPv6 source addresses can leave your network. These systems can
participate in volumetric denial of service attacks. However, it seems
that packets with spoofed source IPv4 addresses are correctly being
filtered. Further, packets with spoofed source addresses claiming to
be from inside your network are not filtered when they arrive from
outside your network.

B PUBLIC REGION-FOCUSED NOTIFICATION
The Spoofer system automatically generated region-focused emails
and sent them using a role account to network operator group mail-
ing lists, using the following general format. The system sorted the
ASes in the improvements table by the date it inferred remediation
to take place, and sorted ASes in the issues table by the date it first
observed spoofed packets. We used translations for the report in
French, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.
From: CAIDA Spoofer Project 
To: 
Subject: CAIDA Spoofer Report for  for 
In response to feedback from operational security communities,
CAIDA’s source address validation measurement project (https://
spoofer.caida.org) is automatically generating monthly reports of
ASes originating prefixes in BGP for systems from which we re-
ceived packets with a spoofed source address. We are publishing
these reports to network and security operations lists in order to
ensure this information reaches operational contacts in these ASes.
