Lets say i have A , B , C and D crons and want to Run Cron B after Completion of Cron A and after that want to run Cron D and after that cron C.

Assistant: Though I agree with suggestions in comment, I think I have a better solution to your problem (Hopefully :))
Although it's not necessary you can use pull queue in your application, to facilitate design of your problem. The pattern I am suggesting is like this:
1) A servlet centrally handles execution (Let's call it controller) of various tasks and is exposed at a URL
2) The jobs are initiated by the controller by hitting the URL of the job (Assuming pull queue again)
3) After job completion, the job hits back at controller URL to report completion of job
4) Controller in turn deletes the job from queue which is done, and adds next logical job to queue
And this is repeated.
In this case your job code is unchanged even if logic of sequence changes or new jobs are added. You might need to make changes to controller only.
