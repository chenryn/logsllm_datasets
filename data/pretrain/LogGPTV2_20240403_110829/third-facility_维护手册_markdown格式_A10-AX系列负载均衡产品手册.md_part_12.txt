character.
For example, “www.example*.com” matches on all the following
domain names: www.example1.com, www.example2.com,
www.examplea.com, www.examplez.com, and so on.
For wildcard matching on more than one character, you can use the
dns contains, dns starts-with, and dns ends-with
options. For example, “dns ends-with example.com” matches on
both abc.example.com and www.example.com.
lid num Specifies a list ID (LID) in the DNS template. LIDs contain DNS cach-
ing policies. The ACOS device applies the DNS caching policy in the
specified LID to the domain-string.
(The other commands are common to all CLI configuration levels. See “Config Commands:
Global” on page61.)
Default None
Mode Configuration mode
Usage Configure the LIDs before configuring the class-list entries. LIDs for DNS caching can be con-
figured in DNS templates. (See “slb template dns” in the Command Line Interface Reference for
ADC.
As an alternative to configuring class entries on the ACOS device, you can configure the class
list using a text editor on another device, then import the class list onto the ACOS device. To
import a class list, see “import” on page46.
If you delete a file-based class list (no class-list list-name), save the configuration
(“write memory” on page57) to complete the deletion.
Example See the “DNS Optimization and Security” chapter in the Application Delivery and Server Load
Balancing Guide.

class-list (for many pools, non-LSN)
Description Configure IP class lists for deployment that use a large number of NAT pools.
Syntax [no] class-list list-name [ipv4 | ipv6] [file filename]
Parameter Description
list-name Adds the list to the running-config.
file filename Saves the list to a standalone file on the ACOS device.
ipv4 | ipv6 Identifies this list as an IPv4 or IPv6 class list.
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified class list, where
the following commands are available.
[no] ipaddr /network-mask glid num
This command specifies the inside subnet that requires the NAT.
Parameter Description
/network-mask Specify the network mask.
To configure a wildcard IP address, specify 0.0.0.0 /0. The wildcard
address matches on all addresses that do not match any entry in
the class list.
glid num Specify the global LID that refers to the pool.
(The other commands are common to all CLI configuration levels. See “Config Commands:
Global” on page61.)
Default None
Mode Configuration mode
Usage First configure the IP pools. Then configure the global LIDs. In each global LID, use the use-
nat-pool pool-name command to map clients to the pool. Then configure the class list
entries.
As an alternative to configuring class entries on the ACOS device, you can configure the class
list using a text editor on another device, then import the class list onto the ACOS device. To
import a class list, see “import” on page46.
If you delete a file-based class list (no class-list list-name), save the configuration
(“write memory” on page57) to complete the deletion.
Example See the “Configuring Dynamic IP NAT with Many Pools” section in the “Network Address
Translation” chapter of the System Configuration and Administration Guide.

NOTE: You cannot use the profile name “default”. This name is reserved and always refers
to the configuration profile that is stored in the image area from which the ACOS
device most recently rebooted.
Default None
Mode Configuration mode
Usage If you are planning to configure a new ACOS device by loading the configuration from
another ACOS device:
1.On the configured ACOS device, use the copy startup-config url command to
save the startup-config to a remote server.
2.On the new ACOS device, use the copy url startup-config command to copy
the configured ACOS device’s startup-config from the remote server onto the new
ACOS device.
3.Use the reboot command (at the Privileged EXEC level) to reboot the new ACOS
device.
4.Modify parameters as needed (such as IP addresses).
If you attempt to copy the configuration by copying-and-pasting it from a CLI session on the
configured ACOS device, some essential parameters such as interface states will not be
copied.
Example The following command copies the configuration profile currently linked to “startup-config”
to a profile named “slbconfig3” and stores the profile locally on the ACOS device:
ACOS(config)#copy startup-config slbconfig3

Mode Configuration mode
Usage If you disable the type of access you are using on the interface you are using at the time you
enter this command, your management session will end. If you accidentally lock yourself out
of the device altogether (for example, if you use the all option for all interfaces), you can
still access the CLI by connecting a PC to the ACOS device’s serial port.
To enable management access, see “enable-management” on page112.
If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context
command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.
You can enable or disable management access, for individual access types and interfaces.
You also can use an Access Control List (ACL) to permit or deny management access through
the interface by specific hosts or subnets.
For more information, see “Access Based on Management Interface” in the Management
Access and Security Guide.
