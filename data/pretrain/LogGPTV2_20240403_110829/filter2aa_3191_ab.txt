### Overview of PLC Systems in Correctional Facilities

#### System Components
- **CPU Output**
- **Input/Output (I/O) Interfaces**
- **Non-Volatile Memory**
- **Relay**
- **Lock Motor**
- **Lock Solenoid**
- **Interlock Panel Switch**
- **Lock Sensor**
- **Door Sensor**
- **Limit Switch**
- **Door Control Unit**
- **Power Supply (+)**
- **Programming Device**
- **Communications Interface**

#### Common Manufacturers
There are approximately 40 to 50 manufacturers of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) used in correctional facilities. The most commonly used brands include:
- Allen-Bradley
- GE Fanuc
- Hitachi
- Mitsubishi
- Panasonic
- Rockwell Automation
- Samsung
- Siemens
- Square-D

#### Communication Protocols
- **9-pin RS-232 or EIA-485**
- **Ethernet**
- **Protocols:**
  - Modbus
  - LonWorks (Most common)
  - BACnet
  - DF1
  - Others

#### Programming Languages
- **Ladder Logic** (Most common, especially for older systems)
- **Function Block Diagram (FBD)**
- **Sequential Function Chart (SFC)**
- **Structured Text (ST; similar to Pascal)**
- **Instruction List (IL)**
- **BASIC**
- **C++**

#### Monitoring and Control
In large facilities, PLCs monitor thousands of points, primarily contact closures, and control hundreds of devices, mainly motors and solenoids. A single door can have up to 34 monitoring points.

#### Perimeter Gate Operators
- **Controlled by PLCs**
- **Open doors and gates, especially during morning hours when controls may shift to Central Control due to staffing shortages.**
- **Can cause phased locks (sliders) to go out of phase, preventing doors or gates from opening, particularly during fire evacuations where "slam-lock" doors can only be unlocked manually with a key. Guards may not always have the key.**
- **Emergency release of entire cell blocks or the entire facility, but this must be managed carefully to prevent cascading releases and power surges that could cause severe damage.**
- **Activate door motors and solenoids, potentially causing high-speed activation that can make them fire off like machine guns.**

#### Security Concerns
- **Radio signal-linked graphic panels in patrol vehicles often use weak or no encryption.**
- **Perimeter fence intrusion detection systems (FIDS) frequently have high nuisance (NAR) and false (FAR) alarm rates, which can be elevated until zones are shut down by Central Control. Taut-wire systems, though less common, have lower NAR and FAR rates.**
- **Belief that PLCs are invulnerable because they are not connected to the Internet is a misconception. Operating system software requires patches and updates, and correctional facilities need to exchange data with federal, state, or local databases. Facility operations often require off-site support from vendors and suppliers.**
- **Some facilities provide Internet access for inmates, though these networks are not connected to the facility's internal networks. However, there are instances of contraband, such as Charles Manson smuggling a cell phone into his cell twice in two years.**
- **Perimeter patrol vehicles and prison intercom systems often have wireless connections, which can be exploited.**

#### Potential Threats
- **Technicians accessing the Equipment Room can be a security risk.**
- **Central Control can be infected via USB drives.**
- **Guards using Internet access for personal purposes, despite policies against it.**
- **Software updates and malicious attacks from outside the facility.**
- **Malicious attacks from within the "sanitized" zone, where the Internet connects to the outside.**

#### Possible Consequences
- **Opening all cell doors, yard doors, and facility gates, leading to chaos, potential murders, and escapes.**
- **Overriding emergency controls for gates wired into Central Control.**
- **Historically, helicopters have been used for prison escapes, making such events more likely than previously thought.**
- **Unsigned software manufacturer/vendor updates and malware on control computers due to personal usage.**
- **Prisoners targeting others within the facility, such as during a fire evacuation, where slamming doors can trap individuals.**
- **Locking down a Housing Unit, setting a mattress fire, and resulting in the death of everyone inside, including guards.**

#### Exploits and Vulnerabilities
- **Exploits for Siemens S7-300, similar to those used in Stuxnet, are simple to write, such as buffer overflows.**
- **Publicly available exploits, such as those released by Luigi Auriemma, Metasploit, and Exploit-DB.**
- **Directly calling PLC functions to suppress alarms and notifications.**
- **Videos and tutorials on YouTube demonstrating these exploits.**

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Proper network segmentation and restricting physical media and access.**
- **Enforcing acceptable use policies regarding Internet access in Control and Equipment Rooms.**
- **Improved communication between IT and physical security.**
- **Regularly patching PLC and controlling computer software.**
- **Heightened security procedures in secured areas.**

#### Stakeholders
- **CISOs of states working to improve security in correctional facilities.**
- **Federal agencies and law enforcement officers providing tours and discussing concerns.**
- **CORE Security Technologies for publishing research and conducting penetration tests.**
