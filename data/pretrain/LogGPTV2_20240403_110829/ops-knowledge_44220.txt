User: I'm trying to bundle a Python library (fontforge) together so that my script runs on a machine without that library installed (but with Python installed). So far I tried copying ".so" files corresponding to "Missing library" errors to current directory, and while it worked for some, it didn't work for others, I'm getting "Missing library: libgunicode" even though I have libgunicode.so in current directory. Is there some setting I can adjust to get it to find it?
Edit: I'm on Ubuntu
Update: I got it to work  by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH=., then copying ".so" files into current directory until I got no more "library not found" messages
Assistant: Assuming you're on Linux, the OS looks for shared objects in the directories listed in /etc/ld.so.conf, /etc/ld.so.conf.d/* and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
