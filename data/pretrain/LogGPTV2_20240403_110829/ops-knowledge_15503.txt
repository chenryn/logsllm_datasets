User: I am used to using PHP and it is easy to set up, I can just run an exe package like Xampp and have apache and PHP running in 5 minutes on my windows system.  Is there something similar to Python?
Assistant: You don't say in your question what you are going to use Python for, so most answers above are completely correct in pointing out that you install Python by downloading it from Python.org. But you seem to expect more. Is it correct to assume you are going to use it to do web development?
In that case, prepare for a shock, because Python doesn't do things like PHP does at all. You want to use a web framework. There are loads of them for Python. Which on to use depends both on what you are going to do, and your personal taste.
The only "Download as one file and install to run" web system I know of that's based on Python is Plone. And Plone is great, but it's not a webframework, it's a content management system. But hey, maybe that's what you want? :-)
The other frameworks are usually easy to install as well. 
(In the long run: If you are going to do web development, you'll be happier with something Unix based. Just saying.)
