About HardenedBSD
About HardenedBSD
● O/cially launched April 2014
● Implementing and upstreaming ASLR is 
hard
● Single repository for FreeBSD exploitation 
mitigation development
● Full fork of FreeBSD
About HardenedBSD
● Many contributors
● Four developers. Two active daily.
● Incoming contributions from universities
● Four dedicated servers. One fully funded 
via IndieGogo.
● Potentially even more servers on their 
way
About HardenedBSD
● Three-year game plan:
– ASLR, mprotect(exec) restrictions, w^x 
upstreamed
– UDEREF
– [lin]procfs restrictions upstreamed
– O/cial releases
– Commercial support
About HardenedBSD
● Five-year game plan:
– 501(c)3 non-pro<t organization
– And for-pro<t arm
– O/cial hardware appliances (<rewalls, 
IDS/IPS, etc.)
– Windows SBS-like tool
Features
● ASLR
● NoExec – AKA w^x, AKA PaX PAGEEXEC
● [lin]procfs protections (lolwut? Yeah, 
really)
● PTrace restrictions
● mmap(map_32bit) hardening
Features
● Complete removal of mmap(NULL, 
MAP_FIXED) support
● Removal of many image activators
● getentropy
● Boot hardening
Features
● PaX-inspired SEGVGUARD
● Intel Supervisor Mode Access Protection 
(SMAP)
● The secadm application
Weather Report
● ASLR
– Version 0
● Being upstreamed
– Version 0.5
● Shared object load order 
randomization
– Will upstream after v0 is accepted
Weather Report
● ASLR
– Version 1
● Research phase
● VDSO randomization
● True stack randomization
– PS_STRINGS
– Breaks a whole ton of ABI/API
Weather Report
● NoExec – AKA w^x, AKA PaX PAGEEXEC
– Inspired by PaX
– Prevent pages from being both writable 
and executable
– Problem: Dynamic code (IE, Java, 
Javascript, JIT engines)
– More research being done
Weather Report
● [lin]procfs hardening
– Inspired by the Linux procfs attack 
vector
● “OpenSSH <=6.6 SFTP 
miscon<guration exploit for 64bit 
Linux”
– Completed
Weather Report
● Userland Enhancements
– Recursive setfacl
Weather Report
● secadm – Security Administration
– Version 0.1 - Released
● Toggle ASLR, mprotect, PAGEEXEC, 
SEVGUARD per-binary
– Version 0.2 – In progress
● Executable File Integrity Enforcement
– Enforce <le hash before exec
– Known as Integriforce
Weather Report
● secadm – Security Administration
– Version 0.3 – Long-Term Research
● Full binary signing, with x509 certs
Weather Report
● Infrastructure
– Nightly build automation with Jenkins
● Release targets signed with GPG
– Package builds with Poudriere
● Packages are signed
● Stress testing!
– All running HardenedBSD
ASLR Implementation
● Based oQ of PaX
– Deltas for execution base, mmap, and 
stack
– Stack is gap-based
● Code dive!
mprotect Implementation
● Inspired by PaX and OpenBSD
– Enforce when PROT_EXEC is enabled on 
a mapping, PROT_WRITE is disabled
● Code dive!
[lin]procfs Implementation
● Cannot write to /proc/pid/mem and 
/proc/pid/*regs
● Code dive!
mmap Implementation
● On amd64: Disable MAP_32BIT support
– Ties into ASLR implementation a bit
● Code dive!
secadm Implementation
● Three moving parts:
– Kernel module
● MAC framework
● sysctl control channel
– Shared library
– Application
● Code dive!
Putting it all Together
● Lots of work done
● Lots of work to do
– Especially with ASLR
● Combine multiple exploitation mitigations 
for best security
Next Milestones
● ASLRv2
● W^X/NoExec/PAGEEXEC
● UDEREF
● Executable <le integrity enforcement
● O/cial release
