When adding to a collection of form elements, the collection is empty after
calling $form->createView() on the parent form.
I noticed this after switching from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0-RC1. It could be intended
behavior but I haven't noticed any documentation indicating a change.
To duplicate the problem, I created a new symfony project via composer create-
project for versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.0-RC1. I then added to the buildForm method
in src/DemoBundle/Form/ContactForm.php:
        $builder->add('foo', 'collection', array('type' => 'text'));
        for ($i = 0; $i get('foo')->add("bar{$i}", 'text');
        }
In 2.2.1, the form displayed when rendering the /demo/contact url contains the
expected 5 text elements. In 2.3.0, the label for "contact_foo" element is
displayed, but none of the sub-elements are displayed.
I believe the cause for this something that occurs during the
$form->createView() call. If you var_dump($form->get('foo')->count()) before
and after calling createView(), you'll get 5/0, respectively in 2.3.0-RC1, and
5/5 in 2.2.1. So far I've not been able to determine the exact cause of the
problem. I am using php 5.4.9-4ubuntu2 with the built-in web-server for this
test.
