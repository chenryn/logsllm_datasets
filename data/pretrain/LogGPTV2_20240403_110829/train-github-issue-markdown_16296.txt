When adding elements to a collection in a form, the collection becomes empty after calling `$form->createView()` on the parent form. I observed this issue after upgrading from Symfony 2.2.1 to 2.3.0-RC1. Although it could be intended behavior, I have not found any documentation that indicates a change.

To reproduce the problem, I created two new Symfony projects using `composer create-project` for versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.0-RC1. I then modified the `buildForm` method in `src/DemoBundle/Form/ContactForm.php` as follows:

```php
$builder->add('foo', 'collection', array('type' => 'text'));
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $builder->get('foo')->add("bar{$i}", 'text');
}
```

In version 2.2.1, rendering the `/demo/contact` URL displays the expected five text elements. However, in version 2.3.0-RC1, only the label for the "contact_foo" element is displayed, and none of the sub-elements are shown.

I believe the issue occurs during the `$form->createView()` call. If you use `var_dump($form->get('foo')->count())` before and after calling `createView()`, you will see the count change from 5 to 0 in 2.3.0-RC1, while it remains 5 in 2.2.1. So far, I have been unable to determine the exact cause of the problem. For this test, I am using PHP 5.4.9-4ubuntu2 with the built-in web server.
