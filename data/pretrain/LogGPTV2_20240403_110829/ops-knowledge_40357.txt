User: How to use common version control tools to manage changes and versions of software projects, and to merge and coordinate changes from multiple developers?
Assistant: Common version control tools include Git, SVN, Mercurial, etc. Here are the steps using Git as an example: 1. Create a warehouse: Create a warehouse on the Git server, or use the git init command locally to create a warehouse. 2. Submit changes: After the developer modifies the code, use the git add command to add the changes to the temporary storage area, and then use the git commit command to submit the changes. 3. Branch management: You can use the git branch command to create, view, and delete branches, and you can also use the git checkout command to switch branches. 4. Merge changes: Use the git merge command to merge the changes of the two branches together. When merging, conflicts may arise that need to be resolved manually. 5. Collaborative development: multiple developers can fork the code to their own warehouse, and submit the changes to the project manager through pull request after modification. The manager can review and decide whether to merge. 6. Version rollback: Use the git revert command to undo a commit change, and use the git reset command to return to a commit point. In short, using version control tools can better manage code changes and versions, coordinate changes made by multiple developers, and avoid confusion and conflicts.
