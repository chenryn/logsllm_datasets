I use http://getbootstrap.com/customize/ to make small customizations to
Bootstrap â€“ setting @brand-primary, @font-family-sans-serif, that sort of
thing. But when I download the customized .css, bootstrap-theme.css isn't
included. Can this be changed? Can the Customize page produce a customized
bootstrap-theme.css?
BTW, I have a workaround (download the source, tweak variables.less,
recompile). But it'd be nice to be able to use the Customize page instead.
