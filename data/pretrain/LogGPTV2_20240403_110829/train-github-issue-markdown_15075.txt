I utilize the customization feature on http://getbootstrap.com/customize/ to make minor adjustments to Bootstrap, such as setting `@brand-primary` and `@font-family-sans-serif`. However, when I download the customized `.css` file, it does not include `bootstrap-theme.css`. Is there a way to modify this behavior? Can the Customize page generate a customized `bootstrap-theme.css` as well?

As a workaround, I currently download the source code, tweak `variables.less`, and then recompile. It would be more convenient, however, to be able to use the Customize page for this purpose.
