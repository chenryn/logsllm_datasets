User: I have an account to a computing cluster that uses Scientific Linux. Of course I only have user access. I'm working with python and I need to run python scripts, so I need to import some python modules. Since I don't have root access, I installed a local python copy on my $HOME with all the required modules. When I run the scripts on my account (hosting node), they run correctly. But in order to submit jobs to the computing queues (to process on much faster machines), I need to submit a bash script that has a line that executes the scripts. The computing cluster uses SunGrid Engine. However when I submit the bash script, I get an error that the modules I installed can't be found!
So my understanding to the problem is that the modules are not sent or something to the machine that executes the script. My question is: is it possible to include all the modules in the script or so?
EDIT: I just created a bash script that runs which python and I noticed that the output was NOT my python copy. But when I run 'which python' on my ssh account, I get my python copy correctly..
Assistant: The submitted script is most likely using the system Python installation and not your own. Try submitting a shell script with only one command, which python, to confirm.
The fix is to prepend the path to your Python interpreter to your system path. On my machine, the right Python is installed at /Users/mbatchkarov/anaconda/bin/python. I added export PATH="/Users/mbatchkarov/anaconda/bin:$PATH" to ~/.bash_profile 
EDIT Add the same line to ~/.bashrc.
