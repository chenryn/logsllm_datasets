Assistant: This is a weirdly-written question indeed. Basically you have a problem with your vmkernel vswitch, i.e. it's a very basic networking issue - nothing to do with ESXi specifically. You need to check the following and in this order;


The cabling between the host, your client and any/all switches/routers in between.
Switch port config at the host end, are you trunking?
The basic IP stuff - i.e. are NMs and DGs correct at both ends, can it ping etc.


What you should also do is use the built-in ESXi network test option on the host, it tests pinging its DG, DNS servers and does a forward/reserve check on itself - all by hitting one enter key :)

Come back to us with more details when you can.
