# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.678]
    PowerToys version: latest
# Steps to reproduce
Open the zone editor on a multi-monitor system. Note that i have both
landscape and portrait monitors on the same system.
# Expected behavior
The zone editor will create overlays over the multiple monitors to allow you
to create zones.
# Actual behavior
The editor overlay is locked to the primary active monitor, cannot be dragged
to other monitors, and doesn't allow rule creation for anything but that
active monitor.
