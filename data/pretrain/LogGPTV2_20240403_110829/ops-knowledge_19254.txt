User: PyDev has a feature to terminate all running processes. Does PyCharm have something similar? I only see a "stop" button in the menu.
Assistant: If you want to force all running processes to stop at once just kill python process. On Windows this can easily be done by clicking 'End Process' on the Task Manager (on the Processes tab).
This is quite usefull if you end up stuck with some running ghost processes of your python app in the background as I had (even when PyCharm was closed).
