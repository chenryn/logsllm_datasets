PyDev has a feature to terminate all running processes. Does PyCharm have something similar? I only see a "stop" button in the menu.

**Assistant:**
If you need to stop all running Python processes at once, you can manually terminate them. On Windows, this can be done by opening the Task Manager, navigating to the "Processes" tab, and clicking "End Process" for the relevant Python processes.

This method is particularly useful if you encounter lingering or "ghost" processes that continue to run in the background, even after closing PyCharm. This can help ensure that all Python-related processes are fully terminated.
