I have installed Python 2.7 on my Windows system and attempted to install `pip` by downloading `get-pip.py`. However, when I ran the script, it did not install anything in the `Scripts` directory within the `Python27` folder, nor in the `Python27/Tools/Scripts` directory.

**Solution:**
I resolved the issue by following these steps:
1. Instead of right-clicking on `get-pip.py` and choosing "Python Launcher for Windows," I opened the Command Prompt.
2. I navigated to the directory containing `get-pip.py` using the `cd` command.
3. I then executed the script by typing `python get-pip.py` in the Command Prompt.

This method successfully installed `pip` in the correct directory.
