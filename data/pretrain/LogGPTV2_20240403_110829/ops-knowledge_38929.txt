User: I have installed Python2.7 on Windows. I tried to install pip, so I downloaded get-pip, then I run it but it didn't install anything in "scripts" in python27, neither in Python27/Tools/Scripts
Assistant: I have solved my problem:
When I have tried to run get-pip, I have right-clicked on the file get-pip.py and I have chosen "Python Launcher for Windows" to run it. Instead, I should have opened the command prompt in the right folder and I should have written "python get-pip.py".
