Hi,  
I was (am) testing the carousel on mobile devices (my android phone), and
noticed it doesn't support touch events (swipe left or right etc).
And I search for the solution and found this
https://github.com/ixisio/bootstrap-touch-carousel
and implemented it and it works fine.
But shouldn't it be a part of core framework? As its main goal is "Mobile
First" so having no touch support for carousel and such doesn't make sense to
me?
Please let me know about future plans of touch support for different elements?
Is this part of 3.1 milestone????
