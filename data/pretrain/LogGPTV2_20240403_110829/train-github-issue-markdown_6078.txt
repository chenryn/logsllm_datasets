### Problem Description
Currently, the `accelerator` property in `MenuItem` accepts only one string,
therefore it's not possible to register multiple shortucts.
### Proposed Solution
The `accelerator` property in `MenuItem` class should accept an array of
strings.
### Alternatives Considered
Adding multiple basically the same `MenuItem`s.

            {
              accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+L',
              label: 'Toggle Overlay',
              click() {
                appWindow.webContents.send('toggle-overlay');
              },
            },
            {
              accelerator: 'Ctrl+Space',
              label: 'Toggle Overlay',
              click() {
                appWindow.webContents.send('toggle-overlay');
              },
            },
