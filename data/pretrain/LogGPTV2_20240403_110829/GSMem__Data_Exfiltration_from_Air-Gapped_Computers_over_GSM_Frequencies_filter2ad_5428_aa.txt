signal  generation  and  reception,  data  modulation,  and 
transmission  detection.  We  implement  a  prototype  of 
GSMem consisting of a transmitter and a receiver and 
evaluate  its  performance  and  limitations.  Our  current 
results  demonstrate 
feasibility, 
achieving an effective transmission distance of 1 - 5.5

1.  Introduction 
Security-aware  organizations  take  various  steps  to 
prevent  possible 
leakage  of  sensitive 
information. The computers responsible for storing and 
processing  sensitive  information  often  operate  on  air-
gapped  networks.  These  networks  are  physically 
disconnected  from  non-essential  networks,  primarily

insiders 
compromising  air-gapped  networks,  as  evidenced  in 
several  incidents  [1]  [2],  some  organizations  have 
begun  to  restrict  USB  access,  to  prevent  malware 
infection or data leakage via USB thumb-drives [3]. 
Acknowledging  the  security  risks  of  mobile  phones 
equipped  with  cameras,  Wi-Fi,  or  Bluetooth,  some 
organizations  has restricted  their  use,  forbidding  them 
the  public  domain.  With

imaging  equipment, 
in  classified  areas.  For  instance,  an  Intel  Corporation 
"Currently, 
best-practices  document 
manufacturing employees can use only basic corporate-
owned  cell  phones  with  voice  and  text  messaging 
features. These phones have no camera, video, or Wi-
Fi."  In  another  case,  visitors  at  one  of  Lockheed-
Martin’s  facilities  [5]  are 
instructed  as  follows: 
"Because ATL is a secure facility, the following items 
are not allowed to our floor of the building: cameras 
(film,  video,  digital), 
tape 
recorders,  sound  recording  devices.  Cell  phones  are 
allowed,  but  camera/recording  features  may  not  be 
used."  Similar  regulations  are  likely  to  be  found  in 
many  other  security-aware  organizations.  Clearly,  the 
issue  of  information  leakage  associated  with  basic 
cellular phones or a phone without a camera, Wi-Fi and 
the  like,  has  been  overlooked  in  cases  in  which  such 
phones  are  allowed  in  the  vicinity  of  air-gapped 
computers.  However, modern computers are electronic 
devices  and  are  bound  to  emit  some  electromagnetic 
radiation (EMR) at various wavelengths and strengths. 
Furthermore,  cellular  phones  are  agile  receivers  of 
EMR  signals.  Combined,  these  two  factors  create  an 
invitation for attackers seeking to exfiltrate data over a 
covert channel. 
In this paper, we present an adversarial attack model in 
which  any  basic  desktop  computer  can  covertly 
transmit data to a nearby mobile phone. Transmission is 
accomplished  by  invoking  specific  memory-related 
CPU  instructions  that  produce  baseband  compliant 
EMR at GSM, UMTS, and LTE frequencies. By using 
the functionality of multi-channel memory architecture, 
the signals are amplified and transmitted with increased 
power.  These  signals  are  received  and  decoded  by  a 
rootkit  installed  at  the  baseband  of  a  standard  mobile 
phone.  To  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  the  attack 
model,  we  developed  GSMem,  a  bifurcated  malware 
that consists of a transmitter that operates on a desktop 
computer  and  a  receiver  that  runs  on  a  GSM  mobile 
phone.  We  implemented  communication  protocols  for 
data  modulation  and  channel  reliability  and  provide 
extensive experimental results.

As  will  be  explained  later,  the  proposed  method  is 
applicable with GSM, UMTS, and LTE basebands. In 
this paper we focus on a prototype using a GSM mobile 
phone as receiver, hence the codename, GSMem.

environment. Signals at GSM frequencies are emitted from 
the workstation and received by the nearby compromised 
mobile phone. 
Figure  1  demonstrates  the  covert  channel  in  a  typical 
real-life  scenario,  in  which  rogue  software  on  a 
computer  (1)  modulates  sensitive  information  and 
transmits 
it  over  GSM  cellular  frequencies.  The 
transmissions take place while the computer is at work, 
without affecting the user experience. A baseband level 
rootkit on the cellular phone (2) receives the signals and 
demodulates  them,  converting  them  into  meaningful 
information. Note that the components exploited by the 
proposed model are present on virtually all computers 
and cellular devices, even on low-end cellular devices 
which are often allowed into classified environments. 
1.1.  The Closed Nature of the Baseband Industry 
The  baseband  chip  of  a  cellular  device  manages  the 
low-level  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  connection  with  the 
cellular  network,  thereby  making  it  an  indispensable 
component.  The  baseband  processor  runs  a  real  time 
operating  system  (RTOS),  stored  in its  firmware. The 
code  is  closed  to  the  public,  and  only  the  device 
manufacturer 
chip’s 
functionality through a limited interface [6]. The RTOS 
source  code,  along  with  the  protocol  stack  and  other 
implementation details, are well-guarded trade secrets, 
kept  off-limits  by  the  protective  baseband  industry, 
which is led by a handful of high-ranking players that 
dominate  the  market  [7].  Lacking  access  to  this 
information, 
and 
implementation  details,  independent  software  vendors 
cannot 
intelligently  develop  new  products  and 
interfacing technologies for baseband chips.

It  can  be  argued  that  the  current  state  of  affairs 
promotes "security through obscurity"  by masking the 
internal  workings  of  the  baseband  systems.  However, 
this  policy  has  only  limited  effectiveness.  Skilled 
hackers  working  on  behalf  of  advanced  persistent 
attackers  eventually  manage 
to  exploit  baseband 
systems—obscure  and  isolated  though  they  may  be. 
Baseband  exploitation  and  attacks  are  thoroughly 
discussed  by  Weinmann  [8]  [9]  [10].  Welte  and 
Markgraf  [6]  also  point  out  several  security  problems 
associated  with 
baseband 
technology and practices. 
1.2.  Paper Contributions 
While emission security (EMSEC) in itself is not a new 
concept  [11],  this  paper  offers  the  following  original 
contributions:  (1)  a  novel  method  for  transmitting 
signals  at  cellular  frequency  bands  from  an  ordinary 
desktop computer, using multi-channel memory related 
CPU  instructions  without  any  special  or  additional 
hardware,  and  (2)  a  novel  method  for  receiving  and 
demodulating  EMR  signals  using  a  rootkit  in  the 
baseband  firmware  of  a  mobile  phone,  thus  turning 
virtually  any  mobile  phone  into  an  effective  EMR 
eavesdropping  device  without  the  use  of  specialized 
equipment. We believe the proposed adversarial attack 
model  constitutes  a  new  security  threat  that  security 
experts should be aware of. 
While  the  bulk  of  this  paper  focuses  on  the  mobile 
phone  as  a  receiver,  we  also  evaluate  an  alternative 
communication  method  in  which  the  transmitter  uses 
memory-related CPU instructions to emit EMR, and the 
receiver  uses  software  defined  radio  (SDR)  with 
dedicated,  yet  affordable  hardware.  This  allows  us  to 
study 
the 
transmission method on a wider scale. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In 
Section 2 we present assorted related works, along with 
a  concise  review  of  our  contributions.  Next, 
in 
Section 3,  we  present  the  adversarial  attack model.  In 
Section  4  we  present 
technical 
background.  Section  5  provides  a  detailed  description 
of  the  transmitter,  followed  by  Section  6  which 
describes  the  receiver.  In  Section  7  we  evaluate 
GSMem and present the results. Next, in Section 8, we 
discuss possible defensive countermeasures. Finally, we 
conclude in Section 9. 
2.  Related Work 
EMSEC, reviewed by Anderson [11], addresses attacks 
which use compromised emanations of either conducted 
or radiated electromagnetic signals. Concern about this 
issue dates back to World War I, but for decades it was

relegated solely to governmental and military agencies 
[12]. However in 1985, van Eck [13] showed how the 
so-called  TEMPEST  exploits  can  be  conducted  using 
affordable  equipment.  He  managed  to  reconstruct  an 
image  from  electromagnetic  signals  produced  by  a 
video card at a considerable distance, using a modified 
TV  set.  Around  2000,  Kuhn  and  Anderson  released 
several  publications  related  to  TEMPEST  [14]  [15], 
demonstrating  that  EMR  emissions  originating  from  a 
desktop  computer  can  be  manipulated  by  appropriate 
software,  in  either  a  defensive  or  offensive  manner. 
Public 
in  EMSEC  and  TEMPEST  was 
amplified by  web publications, offering a glimpse into 
classified TEMPEST-related official standards [16], or 
providing ‘do it yourself’ tutorials related to TEMPEST 
exploits. Thiele [17]  provides an open source program 
dubbed  “TEMPEST  for  Eliza”,  utilizing  the  computer 
CRT monitor to modulate and transmit radio signals at 
AM frequencies.  
Note that side-channels have a variety of possible uses, 
beyond 
information  as 
described in this paper. Side-channels may be used for 
eavesdropping,  attacking 
sophisticated  encryption 
methods,  defensive  detection  of  hidden  malicious 
activities,  and  other  uses.  Furthermore,  side-channels 
are  not  limited  to  electromagnetic  radiation  (EMR). 
Clark, Ransford et al [18] refer to power consumption 
as a side-channel that can reveal hidden information or 
activities.  They  present  ‘WattsUpDoc’,  a  system  that 
detects the presence of malware on medical embedded 
devices  by  measuring 
their  power  consumption. 
Rührmair et al [19] discuss the use of power and timing 
side-channels  to  attack  physical  unclonable  functions 
(PUFs).  Other  researchers  investigating  side-channels 
go beyond EMR emanations. Halevy and Saxena [20], 
explore acoustical eavesdropping, focusing on keyboard 
acoustical  emanations.  Hanspach  and  Goetz  [21] 
present  so-called  “covert  acoustical  networks”.  Their 
method is based  on near-ultrasonic waves, transmitted 
by the speaker of one laptop computer and received by 
the microphone of a nearby laptop computer. Callan et 
al  [22]  provide  a  method  for  measuring  the  so-called 
“signal available to the attacker” (SAVAT), with a side-
channel based on instruction-level events. Their method 
is  based  on  the  EMR  emitted  by  rather  generic 
CPU/memory  operations.  The 
receiver,  however, 
comprises  expensive  dedicated  equipment,  and  the 
range of explored distances is quite limited. Guri et al 
[23] present AirHopper, a bifurcated malware in which 
the transmitter exploits the EMR emanated by the VGA 
cable. The receiver is an FM-enabled standard cellular 
phone. 
2.1  Comparison of Relevant Covert Channels 
Current  state-of-the-art  covert  channels  methods  that 
could  be  used  to  exfiltrate  data  from  air-gapped 
networks involve various physical effects, such as FM 
transmissions  from  a  display  cable  [23],  ultrasonic 
acoustic  emissions  from  a  speaker  [21]  [24],  EMR 
emitted  by  generic  CPU  operations  [22],  and  thermal 
emission  [25].  Our  method,  GSMem,  uses  emissions 
produced  by  multi-channel  memory  data  bus.  Table  1 
provides a brief comparison between GSMem and other 
current models.
