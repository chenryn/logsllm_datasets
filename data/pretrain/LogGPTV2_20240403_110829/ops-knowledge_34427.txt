User: In order to ensure high availability of applications, a company needs to perform elastic scaling on cloud hosts. Please provide a cloud host elastic scaling solution, including monitoring indicators, scaling rules, and alarm mechanisms.
Assistant: Monitoring indicators: 1. CPU usage: monitor the CPU usage of the cloud host, and when it exceeds the set threshold, the instance needs to be expanded. 2. Memory usage: Monitor the memory utilization of the cloud host, and when it exceeds the set threshold, the instance needs to be expanded. 3. Disk usage: Monitor the disk usage of the cloud host, and when it exceeds the set threshold, the instance needs to be expanded. 4. Network I/O: Monitor the network I/O of the cloud host, and when the set threshold is exceeded, the instance needs to be expanded. Scaling rules: 1. Based on CPU utilization: We can set a threshold, for example, when the CPU utilization exceeds 80%, it is necessary to add a new cloud host for capacity expansion. 2. Based on memory utilization: We can set a threshold. For example, when the memory utilization exceeds 90%, a new cloud host needs to be added for capacity expansion. 3. Based on disk usage: We can set a threshold, for example, when the disk usage exceeds 85%, a new cloud host needs to be added for capacity expansion. 4. Based on network I/O: We can set a threshold, for example, when the network I/O exceeds 500MB/s, a new cloud host needs to be added for capacity expansion. Alarm mechanism: 1. When the monitoring index exceeds the threshold, the system will automatically trigger an alarm, and automatically push the alarm information on the designated channel, such as email, SMS, WeChat, etc. 2. The alarm mechanism can also support hierarchical processing of alarm information, and take different processing measures according to different levels of alarms. 3. At the same time, in the alarm mechanism, it is also necessary to manually review the expansion operation to avoid problems such as misoperation or unnecessary cost increase. We can also add monitoring of the system health status to scaling rules to ensure the accuracy and feasibility of scaling operations.
