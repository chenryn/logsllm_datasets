Question: "Consider a scenario where a Java object's finalize method is implemented without a call to super.finalize(). What are the potential consequences of this approach?"
 "A": "It can cause the object to be ineligible for garbage collection, leading to memory leaks."
 "B": "It may result in the incomplete finalization of an object's superclass, potentially leaving allocated resources unfreed."
 "C": "The object might be collected too soon, causing premature disposal of its resources."
 "D": "It could lead to a more efficient garbage collection process as there are fewer method calls involved."
Answer: B
