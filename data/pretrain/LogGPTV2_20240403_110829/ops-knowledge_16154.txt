User: How to implement load balancing through Nginx? What are the specific configuration and optimization skills?
Assistant: Nginx implements load balancing through proxy, usually in two ways: round robin and IP hash. The polling method distributes the request to each back-end server in turn, and the IP hash method forwards the request to a certain server according to the Hash value of the client's IP address. The following are specific configuration and optimization techniques: 1. Configure the Nginx server, and add the address and port of the backend server to the upstream module. upstream backend { server 192.168.1.100:80; server 192.168.1.101:80; } 2. In the server module, configure the proxy_pass proxy setting to specify that the request is forwarded to the backend server in the upstream. server { listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } 3. To optimize the strategy, you can use the health check provided by Nginx to detect the status of the backend server and forward the request according to the load. upstream backend { server 192.168.1.100:80; server 192.168.1.101:80; health_check interval=5s; } 4. Nginx caching technology can be used to reduce the load on the backend server and speed up request response. proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m inactive=60m; server { listen 80; location / { proxy_cache my_cache; proxy_cache_bypass $http_pragma; proxy_cache_revalidate on; proxy_cache_min_uses 3; proxy_cache_ use_stale error timeout invalid_header http_502; proxy_pass http ://backend; } } 5. When using the IP hash algorithm, you can use the consistent hash strategy to solve problems such as node expansion or shrinkage. upstream backend { ip_hash; server 192.168.1.100:80; server 192.168.1.101:80; hash $remote_addr consistent; } 6. For high concurrency, the connection limit can be set according to the number of client connections. http { limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=conn_limit_per_ip:10m; server { listen 80; limit_conn conn_limit_per_ip 20; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } } The above is the basic Nginx load balancing configuration and optimization strategy, which can be adjusted according to the actual situation Adjust and optimize.
