layer is the ﬁrst to apply encryption algorithms, hence, we can
directly read the payload and header information of all packets
below this sublayer. This allows us to passively analyze the
meta information of layer two transmissions, e. g., the PDCP
length of a packet, and perform the website ﬁngerprinting
attack. Further, we exploit
the lack of user data integrity
protection for our ALTER attack.
3) Network Layer: There are three sublayers on the net-
work layer: Non-Access Stratum (NAS), Radio Resource
Control (RRC), and IP. The NAS layer performs mobility with
the core network using encrypted and integrity protected mes-
sages. On the RRC sublayer, all radio connections between the
UE and the eNodeB are managed, including the conﬁguration
of all lower-level protocols down to the physical layer. Finally,
the IP protocol handles transmissions to overlying transport
protocols like TCP and UDP and, therefore, maintains con-
nections to the Internet.
C. Mobility Management
The mobility of devices in the LTE network holds additional
challenges for the speciﬁcation and implementation of all
respective protocols. In the context of this work, the paging
procedure is of particular interest.
Paging. The paging procedure is used to notify the UE
of incoming data transmissions or a call. Sending paging
messages is initiated by the eNodeB, i. e., it broadcasts the
Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) of a certain
UE on the paging channel. All UEs within the cell that do not
have an active radio connection listen to the paging channel
and react to a message in case their TMSI is sent. The paging
procedure affects the identity mapping attack, as it helps the
adversary to learn the unique identiﬁer of a user within the
network.
D. Authentication and Encryption
LTE uses a challenge-response protocol for Authentication
and Key Agreement (AKA) in which the core network (EPC)

sends an authentication request to the UE. This request con-
tains an authentication token for veriﬁcation of the network’s
permanent key on the SIM card of the UE. In case of a
successful veriﬁcation, both the network and the UE can
derive a session key from the long-term secret and the random
nonce. Using this temporary key material, the NAS and RRC
sublayers of the data link layer can establish encryption and
integrity protection mechanisms, respectively. The selection
of certain security algorithms depends on the network and
is deﬁned in the security mode command, sent out by the
EPC/eNodeB.
LTE speciﬁes different security mechanisms based on well-
established encryption algorithms such as AES. Integrity pro-
tection is accomplished by a cipher block chaining message
authentication code (CBC-MAC) that is appended to signaling
messages. User data is encrypted in counter mode (AES-
CTR), where the encryption algorithm is used as a keystream
generator, and the ciphertext is computed by XORing the
keystream with the plaintext1. In fact, this helps us later to
perform our ALTER attack given that the cipher is malleable.
E. Attacker Model
We use two different attacker models for our layer two
security analysis. The passive attacker acts as an eavesdropper
and can passively sniff radio layer information within the
victim’s cell and remains unnoticed. In contrast, the active
attacker extends these capabilities for intercepting messages
as a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker. More speciﬁcally,
such an attacker can alter message contents and forward the
altered packets to the next node. Both attackers depend only on
low-budget SDR hardware (in practice, our setup costs about
2600 $ for the active relay) and uses open-source LTE stack
implementations [13], [14] that we extended for our attacks.
These constraints and requirements render both passive and
active attacks a realistic threat in practice. In summary, we
assume the following attacker model:
Passive Attacker. The passive attacker eavesdrops transmis-
sions in up- and downlink direction within the same cell the
user is located in. Therefore, the attacker can receive and
decode signals sent out by the eNodeB and the UE. To do so, it
is not mandatory to have any knowledge about the established
key material.
Active Attacker. In addition to the scope of the passive
attacker, the active attack includes capabilities for sending
radio signals on certain frequencies. Using these capabilities,
the attacker can establish a malicious relay in the network
by impersonating a UE towards the network and an eNodeB
towards the user. Again, no knowledge of the key material is
required for our attacks.
III. PASSIVE LAYER TWO ATTACKS
Our passive attacks comprise identity mapping, in which
the attacker learns the identity of a user by eavesdropping on

algorithm; EEA2 is relevant in our context and the underlying algorithm is
AES.
the connection establishment procedure. Furthermore, identity
mapping serves as a stepping stone for the second attack: web-
site ﬁngerprinting by transmission metadata. Website ﬁnger-
printing reveals the browsing behavior of a user by exploiting
resource allocation scheduling of the network.
A. Identity Mapping Attack
The identity mapping attack exploits temporary identiﬁers
on layer two during the radio connection establishment. It does
not depend on any active interference like comparable paging
attacks [2], [15], [16]. Compared to the previous mention of
this attack vector [3], we describe the attack details and present
a practical evaluation in a commercial network using a simple
downlink sniffer. In the following, we introduce the attacker
assumptions, the connection establishment process, give an
overview of the attack procedure, and present experimental
results.
Attack Assumption. For the identity mapping attack, we
assume that the attacker knows neither the RNTI nor the
TMSI of a victim. The attacker learns the mapping between
both identities during the radio layer connection establishment,
which is triggered every time a user sends or receives data
through the network. We exploit the fact that radio packets
contain both their own radio layer identity (RNTI) and the
TMSI of the overlying Non-Access Stratum (NAS). The map-
ping can then be further exploited, e. g., the attacker performs
a paging attack to map the TMSI to the public phone number
or she can perform a website ﬁngerprint attack.
Connection Establishment Process. In the connecting pro-
cess, the UE sends a Random Access Preamble (RAP) to
the eNodeB (cf. Figure 2 1 ) and receives the response
(RAR) including the Cell Radio Network Temporary Identity
(C-RNTI) 2 . The C-RNTI serves as a unique identiﬁer of the
user within one radio session until the connection is released.
In response to receiving the C-RNTI, the UE sends an RRC
connection request to the eNodeB 3 , which includes the
UE’s identity. This can either be the TMSI or a random
value in case the UE does not possess a valid TMSI at this
moment. The eNodeB completes the connection establishment
by replying with the RRC connection setup message 4 . In
our attack, we either exploit the RRC connection request 3 in
uplink direction, or the RRC connection setup 4 in downlink
direction.
The Attack. Matching the C-RNTI and the TMSI becomes
possible, as packets on the MAC layer use the C-RNTI to
be addressed correctly, i. e., delivered to the correct UE. The
UE receives the C-RNTI within the Random Access Response
(RAR) 2 which from now on identiﬁes the UE on the MAC
layer. At this point, we beneﬁt from the fact that there are
only ten possible Random Access RNTIs (RA-RNTIs), hence,
we can monitor all possible RAR and derive the C-RNTI.
The information of the RAR in message 2 is sufﬁcient for
conducting the identity mapping in the following steps 3 , 4
of the connection establishment. In particular, we match the
C-RNTI and the TMSI by (a) using an uplink sniffer or

by (b) exploiting the contention-based resolution of the RRC
connection setup.
(a) In response to the RAR 2 ,
the UE sends the RRC
connection request 3 including the TMSI. We use the
C-RNTI for identifying the uplink resource allocation for
the target UE, e. g., we can distinguish multiple transmis-
sions in the uplink direction (cf. Figure 2, green) and ﬁlter
out the speciﬁc RRC connection request that matches the
monitored C-RNTI. In other words, we know when the
UE uses the uplink for transmitting the RRC connection
request
including the TMSI. We can now match the
C-RNTI 2 and TMSI 3 for a successful attack.
(b) After the RRC connection request, the eNodeB proac-
tively applies contention-based resolution for resolving
possible collisions during the random access procedure
(cf. Figure 2 1 ). Such collisions can occur when more
than one UE choose the same RAP within the same
time slot. The only case of contention-free RAPs oc-
curs during a handover procedure. In all other cases,
the RRC connection setup 4
includes a copy of the
RRC connection request 3 with its UE identity. More
precisely, the speciﬁcation states that the UE contention
resolution identity ﬁeld of the RRC connection setup must
contain the previous uplink data unit (see [17] in Section
6.1.3.4). In our case the precious uplink data unit is the
RRC connection request. As the RRC connection request
contains the UE identity, e. g., the TMSI or random value,
we can now match the C-RNTI 2 and TMSI 4 .
1) Experiments: We demonstrate the real-world feasibility
of the identity mapping attack by conducting it in a commer-
cial network. In the following, we introduce the technical setup
and attack procedure.
Experimental Setup. In our setup, we use two SDRs [13],
one representing the target UE (cf. Figure 2), and the other
representing the attacker’s downlink sniffer (b).
The target UE implements a modiﬁed version of srsUE [14],
e. g., we extend the software stack such that we can connect to
a commercial network. This requires commercial SIM support
only, which we realize by using the PCSC library [18]. Using
these extensions, we can establish an IP connection through
the commercial network to the Internet. The second SDR
acts as the attacker’s passive downlink sniffer. We use it to
listen to the broadcast channels of the eNodeB. Again, the
sniffer implements the srsLTE software stack. For verifying
the success of both attack variants, we record traces at the UE
uplink (a) and the downlink sniffer (b).
Procedure. In our experiments, we ﬁrst assure that all required
preconditions are met and subsequently perform the identity
mapping attack.
• Precondition: TMSI. The UE performs a radio con-
nection establishment with the eNodeB followed by a
successful AKA with the core network. The core network
replies with the UE’s valid TMSI for all further commu-
nication. This assures that the UE uses a valid TMSI for
the following steps.
• Precondition: Radio Idle. The UE remains idle withing
the range of the RRC inactivity timer (as default 10 s).
Then,
into the
RRC idle state. This assures the performance of the
radio connection establishment process as soon as the
UE intends to send data through the network.
the eNodeB signals the UE to transit
Both preconditions create a setup that is comparable to the
characteristics of a real-world scenario, i. e., we assume the
possession of a valid TMSI for the user and conduct the attack
during the connection establishment.
1) Attack Step 1. We setup a new TCP connection to
an arbitrary server in the Internet and trigger the radio
connection establishment process (cf. Figure 2).
2) Attack Step 2. We use the downlink sniffer to eavesdrop
the random access responses of the eNodeB for learning
all C-RNTI candidates. Up to this point the attack steps
are generic, i. e., we can use the C-RNTI of message 2
for the up- or downlink sniffer. We continue with attack
mode (b).
3) Attack Step 3. The eNodeB sends the TMSI in the RRC
connection setup 4 within the contention-based resolu-
tion. We eavesdrop this information using the downlink
sniffer.
4) Attack Step 4. We match the set of C-RNTIs of attack
step 2 with the TMSI of the contention-based resolution.
We can now identify and localize the user within the cell.
The above attack procedure depends on the presence of a
valid TMSI within the contention-based resolution. We verify
this as an attack procedure with high success probability in our
experiments and discuss the use of either an up- or downlink
sniffer in the discussion.
2) Results: We successfully repeat the identity mapping
attack three times using a downlink sniffer. Furthermore, we
provide a theoretical analysis of uplink traces as proof for the
feasibility of the uplink sniffer. Figure 3 depicts the Wireshark
trace of the RRC connection setup contention-based resolution
(attack step 3), recorded by the downlink sniffer. In particular,
we see the RRC connection setup message 4 addressed to
C-RNTI of the target UE 1 that we learned from the RAR
of the eNodeB. In the contention-based resolution 2 , we
ﬁnd the TMSI assigned to the target UE 3 as part of the
RRC connection request. By combining both identiﬁers, we
successfully match layer two and three identities.

Identity Mapping Attack: We can decode the TMSI of the RRC
connection request as part of the contention resolution identity in the downlink
RRC connection setup message. The contention resolution identity (2) is part
of the MAC header and located before the RRC connection setup (4). We
successfully map the TMSI to the C-RNTI with a downlink sniffer.
As the downlink sniffer depends on the presence of the
TMSI within the RRC connection setup, we record a total
of 96,911 connection establishment procedures within ﬁve
days. We conduct these measurements within the cell of a
commercial network. Our results show that in 96.85 % of all
radio connection establishments we ﬁnd a contention-based
resolution, of which 91.75 % contain the required TMSI. As
this covers the majority of connections, the downlink sniffer
can be considered a reliable attack variant.
3) Discussion: We next discuss the real-world applicability
of identity mapping and compare the deployment of an up- or
downlink sniffer.
Real-World Applicability. The identity mapping attack by it-
self is not detectable, as it is completely passive. Deploying the
passive downlink sniffer only depends on standard hardware
and an open software stack. Nevertheless, one constraint is the
existence of a valid TMSI.
While the proposed identity mapping combines arbitrary
pairs of C-RNTIs and TMSIs, we can extend the attack by
common active paging techniques [2], [3], [16]. This allows
us to identify and localize speciﬁc users for a pre-known TMSI
within the cell. We achieve this targeted detection of users at
the expense of being detectable through active interference.
