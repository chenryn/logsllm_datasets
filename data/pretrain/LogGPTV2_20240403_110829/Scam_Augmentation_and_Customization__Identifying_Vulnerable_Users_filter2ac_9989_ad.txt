the range of possible values and range of the participants’ scores in
each trait. It shows that participants’ scores approximately cover
from lowest to highest scores for all the traits.
Figure 3 shows the correlation between participants’ personality
traits, detection rate and average confidence level (ACL). Our re-
sults show a positive significant correlation between openness and
participants’ ability in detecting fake offers. It means people with
higher openness tend to perform better in detection fake offers. We
also see significant correlations between all five personality traits
and average confidence level of participants over all four questions
with conscientiousness and neuroticism having the largest positive
and negative correlation respectively. Having the proper knowl-
edge about participants’ personality traits and their performance
can help security providers to customize their training programs
to address users’ vulnerabilities appropriately.
We also asked three questions to measure participants’ cognitive
ability. The cognitive test assesses individuals’ ability to suppress
an intuitive and spontaneous wrong answer in favor of a reflective
and deliberative right answer. We used the three questions test
proposed in [26]. It gives a score between zero to three depending
on how many questions answered correctly. As shown in Figure 3,
there is no significant correlation between CRT and participants’
ability in detecting legitimate and fake offers.
6.7 Background Knowledge and Demographics
At the beginning of the survey, we asked participants about their
demographics and background knowledge about computer and
email (Section 4). Ordered logistic regression analysis was used
to test if background knowledge and experience significantly pre-
dicted participants’ detection rate. We used detection rate as the
dependent variable and gender (female: 0 and male: 1), education
level, technology background, and age as the independent variables.
The regression results showed that older participants performed
better in detecting the legitimate and fake offers (OR=1.01, p1&3(attentive)Number of clues mentionedSession 5: Usable Security & Privacy ASIA CCS '20, October 5–9, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan245Table 7: Comparison with previous work.
