User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows that the mod_jk child workerEnv is in an error state 6 multiple times. It also shows that jk2_init() is finding multiple children in scoreboard slots and that workerEnv.init() is ok with the /etc/httpd/conf/workers2.properties file.
