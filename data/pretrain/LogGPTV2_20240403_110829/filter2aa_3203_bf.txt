**Chapter Glossary**

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: A hierarchical, distributed database that maps domain names to various types of data, such as IP addresses. It enables the location of computers and services by user-friendly names and the discovery of other information stored in the database.

- **DNS Dynamic Update**: An update to the DNS standard that allows DNS clients to dynamically register and update their resource records in the primary server's zones.

- **DNS Server**: A server that maintains a database of mappings of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to various types of data, such as IP addresses.

- **Domain**: Any branch of the DNS namespace.

- **Forward Lookup**: A DNS query that maps an FQDN to an IP address.

- **Forwarder**: A DNS server designated by other internal DNS servers to forward queries for resolving external or offsite DNS domain names, such as those used on the Internet.

- **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**: A DNS name that indicates its absolute location in the domain namespace tree. An FQDN has a trailing period (.) to qualify its position relative to the root of the namespace. For example, `host.example.microsoft.com.`.

- **Host Name**: The DNS name of a host or interface on a network. For one computer to find another, the name of the computer to locate must either appear in the Hosts file on the computer that is looking, or the name must be known by a DNS server. For most Windows-based computers, the host name and the computer name are the same.

- **Host Name Resolution**: The process of resolving a host name to a destination IP address.

- **Hosts File**: A local text file in the same format as the 4.3 BSD release of UNIX `/etc/hosts` file. This file maps host names to IP addresses and is stored in the `systemroot\System32\Drivers\Etc` folder.

- **Iterative Query**: A query made to a DNS server for the best answer the server can provide.

- **Master Server**: A DNS server that is authoritative for a zone and serves as a source of zone information for other secondary servers. A master server can be either a primary or secondary master server, depending on how the server obtains its zone data.

- **Primary Server**: A DNS server that is authoritative for a zone and can be used as a point of update for the zone. Only primary servers can be updated directly to process zone updates, which include adding, removing, or modifying resource records stored as zone data.

- **Recursive Query**: A query made to a DNS server where the requester asks the server to assume the full workload and responsibility for providing a complete answer to the query. The DNS server will then use separate iterative queries to other DNS servers on behalf of the requester to assist in completing the answer for the recursive query.

- **Reverse Lookup**: A DNS query that maps an IP address to an FQDN.

- **Root Domain**: The beginning of the DNS namespace.

- **Secondary Server**: A DNS server that is authoritative for a zone and obtains its zone information from a master server.

- **Second-Level Domain**: A DNS domain name rooted hierarchically at the second tier of the domain namespace, directly beneath the top-level domain names. On the Internet, second-level domains are names registered and delegated to individual organizations and businesses, such as `microsoft.com`.

- **Subdomain**: A DNS domain located directly beneath another domain (the parent domain) in the namespace tree. For example, `example.microsoft.com` would be a subdomain of the domain `microsoft.com`.

- **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: Domain names rooted hierarchically at the first tier of the domain namespace, directly beneath the root (.) of the DNS namespace. On the Internet, TLDs such as `.com` and `.org` are used to classify and assign second-level domain names to individual organizations and businesses according to their organizational purpose.

- **Zone**: A manageable unit of the DNS database that is administered by a DNS server. A zone stores the domain names and data of the domain with a corresponding name, except for domain names stored in delegated subdomains.

- **Zone Transfer**: The synchronization of authoritative DNS data between DNS servers. A DNS server configured with a secondary zone periodically queries its master server to synchronize its zone data.

### Chapter 9 – Windows Support for DNS
**TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows**  
Page: 241

**Abstract**
This chapter describes the details of Domain Name System (DNS) support in Windows, which consists of the DNS Client and DNS Server services. Windows Vista and Windows XP include the DNS Client service, while Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 include both the DNS Client and DNS Server services. A network administrator must understand the capabilities and configuration of both the DNS Client and DNS Server services to effectively manage and troubleshoot a DNS name infrastructure and DNS name resolution behavior on a Windows network.

**Chapter Objectives**
After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Describe the capabilities and configuration of the DNS Client service.
- Describe the name resolution process of the DNS Client service.
- List and describe the features of the DNS Server service.
- Install the DNS Server service and configure its properties.
- Configure DNS zones and zone transfers.
- Delegate authority for zones.
- Configure DNS dynamic update behavior for both the DNS Client service and the DNS Server service.
- Configure Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) lookup and WINS reverse lookup.
- Describe how to use the Nslookup tool.

**The DNS Client Service**
The DNS Client service in Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 is responsible for name resolution, caching of name resolution attempts (including negative caching), tracking connection-specific domain names, and prioritizing multiple resource records of the same type based on their IP addresses.

**DNS Client Configuration**
You can configure the DNS Client service in the following ways:
- Automatically, using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and DHCP options.
- Manually, using either the Netsh tool or the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component in the Network Connections folder.
- Automatically, for Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connections.
- Automatically, using Computer Configuration Group Policy.

To determine the IP addresses of the DNS servers and the DNS domain name assigned to the connections of your computer running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003, do one of the following:
- Use the `ipconfig /all` command.
- Use the `netsh interface ipv4 show dns`, `netsh interface ipv6 show dns`, or `netsh interface ip show dns` commands.
- Open the Network Connections folder, right-click a connection, and click Status. Click the Support tab, and then click Details.

**DHCP Configuration of the DNS Client Service**
As described in Chapter 6, "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol," DHCP provides IP configuration information to DHCP clients. You can assign the IPv4 addresses of DNS servers to DHCP clients by configuring the DNS Servers DHCP option (option 6). You can assign a DNS domain name to DHCP clients by configuring the DNS Domain Name DHCP option (option 15). You can assign the IPv6 addresses of DNS servers to DHCPv6 clients by configuring the DNS Recursive Name Server IPv6 Address List option. If DNS servers or the connection-specific domain name are manually configured in the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component, the DNS Client service ignores the DHCP-based DNS settings.

**Manual Configuration of the DNS Client Service Using Network Connections**
To manually configure the DNS Client service on a specific connection using the Network Connections folder, obtain the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component for the network connection. You can configure the following DNS Client service settings from the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component:
- Primary and alternate DNS server addresses for the connection.
- Primary and alternate DNS server addresses for the alternate configuration for the connection.
- Advanced DNS properties.

Figure 9-1 shows the configuration of primary and alternate DNS server addresses on the General tab.

**Figure 9-1: Primary and alternate DNS servers on the General tab**

In this example, IPv4 addresses for primary and alternate DNS servers are configured for a connection with a static IPv4 address configuration. You can also configure addresses for primary and alternate DNS servers even when the connection is configured to obtain an IPv4 address automatically (using DHCP).

As Figure 9-2 shows, you can also specify the IPv4 addresses of a primary and an alternate DNS server when you configure an alternate configuration (for example, so that you can seamlessly operate your laptop computer on a work network that uses DHCP and on a home network that uses static IPv4 configuration).

**Figure 9-2: Primary and alternate DNS servers on the Alternate Configuration tab**

The example in Figure 9-2 shows the configuration of a primary DNS server corresponding to an Internet gateway device (IGD) on a home network. The IGD is acting as a DNS server for all of the computers on the home network.

To manually configure the IPv4 addresses of more than two DNS servers or to configure additional DNS Client service settings for a connection, open the Network Connections folder, right-click the connection, and click Properties. Then click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) without clearing its check box, click Properties, click Advanced, and click the DNS tab. Figure 9-3 shows an example of the DNS tab.

**Figure 9-3: The DNS tab from the advanced configuration of Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**

From the DNS tab, you can configure the following:
- **DNS server addresses, in order of use**: Lists one or more DNS servers that the computer queries, in order. If you want to manually configure more than two DNS servers, you must add them to this list and configure their order.
- **Append primary and connection-specific DNS suffixes**: Specifies whether you want to use the primary and connection-specific DNS suffixes to attempt to resolve unqualified names. An unqualified name has no trailing period, such as `dev.example`. In contrast, a fully qualified name has a trailing period, such as `dev.example.com.`. The primary DNS suffix is assigned to the computer and configured from the Computer Name tab of the System item in Control Panel. Connection-specific DNS suffixes are assigned to each connection, either manually or through the DNS Domain Name DHCP option. For more information about the name resolution process, see the “Name Resolution Behavior” section of this chapter.
- **Append parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix**: Specifies that during name resolution, the DNS Client service uses the parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix, up to the second-level domain, in an attempt to resolve unqualified host names.
- **Append these DNS suffixes**: Specifies a list of DNS suffixes to try during name resolution, instead of the primary and connection-specific DNS suffixes.
- **DNS suffix for this connection**: Specifies a DNS suffix for this specific connection. The DNS Client service uses the connection-specific suffix to identify this connection on the computer, whereas the DNS Client service uses the primary suffix to identify the computer regardless of the connection. If you specify a DNS suffix, the DNS Client service ignores the DNS suffix obtained through the DNS Domain Name DHCP option.
- **Register this connection’s addresses in DNS**: Specifies that the DNS Client service uses DNS dynamic update to register the IP addresses of this connection with the primary name of the computer, which consists of the computer name combined with the primary suffix.
- **Use this connection’s DNS suffix in DNS registration**: Specifies that the DNS Client service uses DNS dynamic update to register the IP addresses of this connection with the name of the connection—the computer name combined with the connection-specific suffix—in addition to the primary name of the computer.

To manually configure the DNS Client service in Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 for the IPv6 addresses of DNS servers on a specific connection, obtain the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) component for the network connection. You can configure the following DNS Client service settings from the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) component:
- Primary and alternate DNS server IPv6 addresses for the connection.
- Advanced DNS client properties.

For the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) component, configuration of the IPv6 addresses of DNS servers and advanced DNS client properties is very similar to IPv4.

**Manual Configuration Using Netsh**
You can also configure DNS server settings for the DNS Client service from the command line using the `netsh interface ipv4 set dnsserver` or `netsh interface ip set dns` commands.

By default, the DNS Client service uses IPv4 for all DNS messages. For computers running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, use the following command:
```
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsserver [name=]String [source=]dhcp|static [addr=]IPv6Address|none [[register=]none|primary|both]
```
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not support DNS traffic over IPv6.

**Configuration for Remote Access Clients**
Dial-up or virtual private network-based remote access clients running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 obtain the initial configuration of a primary and alternate DNS server during the negotiation of the Point-to-Point (PPP) connection. The PPP negotiation includes the Primary DNS Server Address and Secondary DNS Server Address options in the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) as specified in RFC 1877.

Remote access clients running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 also use a DHCPInform message to obtain an updated list of DNS servers and the DNS domain name. If the remote access server running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 is correctly configured with the DHCP Relay Agent routing protocol component, it forwards the DHCPInform message to a DHCP server and forwards the response (a DHCPAck message) back to the remote access client.

If the remote access client receives a response to the DHCPInform message, the DNS servers contained in the DHCPAck message replace the DNS servers configured during the PPP connection negotiation.

**Configuration of DNS Settings Using Group Policy**
You can also configure DNS settings using Computer Configuration Group Policy and the Group Policy Object Editor snap-in. By using this snap-in, you can modify Group Policy objects for system containers (such as sites, domains, or organizational units) within Active Directory. To configure DNS settings, open the Group Policy Object Editor snap-in, and click the Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\DNS Client node in the tree, as shown in Figure 9-4.

**Figure 9-4: DNS settings in Computer Configuration Group Policy**

Group Policy-based DNS settings override the equivalent settings configured on the local computer or through DHCP.

**Name Resolution Behavior**
When an application uses the `getaddrinfo()` or `gethostbyname()` Windows Sockets functions, the resolver component of the DNS Client service performs name resolution as described in Chapter 7, “Host Name Resolution.” The DNS Client service checks the local host name and the local DNS client resolver cache, and then the service sends out DNS Name Query Request messages.

If DNS name resolution fails and the name is longer than 15 bytes, name resolution fails, and TCP/IP for Windows indicates the error condition to the application. If the name is 15 bytes or shorter in length, the resolver verifies whether NetBIOS over TCP/IP is enabled. If it is not enabled, name resolution fails. If NetBIOS is enabled, the resolver converts the name to a NetBIOS name and attempts NetBIOS name resolution.

Before the resolver sends any DNS Name Query Request messages, it determines the type of name to resolve. An application can submit one of the following types of names:
- **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**: Names that are terminated with a period, indicating the name relative to the root domain of the DNS. For example, `host7.example.com.`
- **Single-Label, Unqualified Domain Names**: Names that consist of a single label and contain no periods. For example, `host7`.
- **Multiple-Label, Unqualified Domain Names**: Names that contain more than one label and one or more periods but are not terminated with a period. For example, `host7.example` or `example.com`.

**Name Resolution for FQDNs**
When the application specifies an FQDN, the resolver queries DNS using that name. No other combinations are tried.

**Name Resolution for Single-Label, Unqualified Domain Names**
When the application specifies a single-label, unqualified domain name, the resolver systematically appends different DNS suffixes to the single-label, unqualified domain name, adds periods to make them FQDNs, and submits them to DNS for name resolution. The resolver appends the DNS suffixes to the single-label, unqualified domain name in the following order:
1. The primary DNS suffix.
2. The connection-specific DNS suffix.
3. The parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix, up to the second-level domain.
4. The DNS suffixes specified in the "Append these DNS suffixes" setting.

This systematic approach ensures that the resolver tries all possible combinations to resolve the name.
