Chapter Glossary 
DNS – See Domain Name System (DNS). 
DNS dynamic update - An update to the DNS standard that permits DNS clients to dynamically register 
and update their resource records in the zones of the primary server. 
DNS server – A server that maintains a database of mappings of FQDNs to various types of data, such 
as IP addresses. 
domain – Any branch of the DNS namespace. 
Domain Name System (DNS) – A hierarchical, distributed database that contains mappings of DNS 
domain names to various types of data, such as IP addresses. DNS enables the location of computers 
and services by user-friendly names and the discovery of other information stored in the database. 
forward lookup – A DNS query that maps an FQDN to an IP address. 
forwarder - A DNS server designated by other internal DNS servers to be used to forward queries for 
resolving external or offsite DNS domain names, such as those used on the Internet. 
FQDN – See fully qualified domain name. 
fully qualified domain name (FQDN) - A DNS name that has been stated to indicate its absolute location 
in the domain namespace tree. An FQDN has a trailing period (.) to qualify its position relative to the 
root of the namespace. An example is host.example.microsoft.com. 
host name – The DNS name of a host or interface on a network. For one computer to find another, the 
name of the computer to locate must either appear in the Hosts file on the computer that is looking, or 
the name must be known by a DNS server. For most Windows-based computers, the host name and 
the computer name are the same.  
Host name resolution – The process of resolving a host name to a destination IP address. 
Hosts file – A local text file in the same format as the 4.3 BSD release of UNIX /etc/hosts file. This file 
maps host names to IP addresses, and it is stored in the systemroot\System32\Drivers\Etc folder. 
iterative query - A query made to a DNS server for the best answer the server can provide. 
master server – A DNS server that is authoritative for a zone and that is also a source of zone 
information for other secondary servers. A master server can be either a primary or secondary master 
server, depending on how the server obtains its zone data. 
primary server – A DNS server that is authoritative for a zone and that can be used as a point of update 
for the zone. Only primary servers can be updated directly to process zone updates, which include 
adding, removing, or modifying resource records that are stored as zone data. 
recursive query – A query made to a DNS server in which the requester asks the server to assume the 
full workload and responsibility for providing a complete answer to the query. The DNS server will then 
use separate iterative queries to other DNS servers on behalf of the requester to assist in completing 
an answer for the recursive query. 
reverse lookup – A DNS query that maps an IP address to an FQDN. 
root domain - The beginning of the DNS namespace. 
Chapter 8 – Domain Name System Overview 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 240 
secondary server - A DNS server that is authoritative for a zone and that obtains its zone information 
from a master server. 
second-level domain – A DNS domain name that is rooted hierarchically at the second tier of the 
domain namespace, directly beneath the top-level domain names. Top-level domain names include 
.com and .org. When DNS is used on the Internet, second-level domains are names that are registered 
and delegated to individual organizations and businesses. 
subdomain - A DNS domain located directly beneath another domain (the parent domain) in the 
namespace tree. For example, example.microsoft.com would be a subdomain of the domain 
microsoft.com.  
top-level domains – Domain names that are rooted hierarchically at the first tier of the domain 
namespace directly beneath the root (.) of the DNS namespace. On the Internet, top-level domain 
names such as .com and .org are used to classify and assign second-level domain names (such as 
microsoft.com) to individual organizations and businesses according to their organizational purpose. 
zone – A manageable unit of the DNS database that is administered by a DNS server. A zone stores 
the domain names and data of the domain with a corresponding name, except for domain names stored 
in delegated subdomains. 
zone transfer - The synchronization of authoritative DNS data between DNS servers. A DNS server 
configured with a secondary zone periodically queries its master server to synchronize its zone data.

Chapter 9 – Windows Support for DNS 
Abstract 
This chapter describes the details of Domain Name System (DNS) support in Windows, which consists of the DNS 
Client and DNS Server services. Windows Vista and Windows XP include the DNS Client service, and Windows Server 
2008 and Windows Server 2003 include both the DNS Client and the DNS Server services. A network administrator 
must understand the capabilities and configuration of both the DNS Client and DNS Server services to effectively 
manage and troubleshoot a DNS name infrastructure and DNS name resolution behavior on a Windows network.

The DNS Client Service 
The DNS Client service in Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 
Server 2003 is responsible for name resolution, caching of name resolution attempts (including 
negative caching), tracking connection-specific domain names, and prioritizing multiple resource 
records of the same type based on their IP addresses. 
The following sections describe how to configure the DNS Client service and how it resolves names. 
DNS Client Configuration 
You can configure the DNS Client service in the following ways: 
Automatically, using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and DHCP options. 
Manually, using either the Netsh tool or the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or 
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component in the Network Connections folder. 
Automatically, for Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connections. 
Automatically, using Computer Configuration Group Policy. 
To determine the IP addresses of the DNS servers and the DNS domain name assigned to the 
connections of your computer running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or 
Windows Server 2003, do one of the following: 
Use the ipconfig /all command. 
Use the netsh interface ipv4 show dns, netsh interface ipv6 show dns or netsh interface ip show 
dns commands. 
Open the Network Connections folder, right-click a connection, and click Status. Click the Support tab, 
and then click Details. 
The following sections describe how to configure the DNS Client service. 
DHCP Configuration of the DNS Client Service 
As described in Chapter 6, "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol," DHCP provides IP configuration 
information to DHCP clients. You can assign the IPv4 addresses of DNS servers to DHCP clients by 
configuring the DNS Servers DHCP option (option 6). You can assign a DNS domain name to DHCP 
clients by configuring the DNS Domain Name DHCP option (option 15). You can assign the IPv6 
addresses of DNS servers to DHCPv6 clients by configuring the DNS Recursive Name Server IPv6 
Address List option. If DNS servers or the connection-specific domain name are manually configured in 
the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component, 
the DNS Client service ignores the DHCP-based DNS settings. 
Manual Configuration of the DNS Client Service Using Network Connections 
To manually configure the DNS Client service on a specific connection using the Network Connections 
folder, obtain the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) 
component for the network connection. You can configure the following DNS Client service settings 
Chapter 9 – Windows Support for DNS 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 244 
from the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) 
component: 
Primary and alternate DNS server addresses for the connection. 
Primary and alternate DNS server addresses for the alternate configuration for the connection. 
Advanced DNS properties. 
Figure 9-1 shows the configuration of primary and alternate DNS server addresses on the General tab.  
Figure 9-1  Primary and alternate DNS servers on the General tab 
In this example, IPv4 addresses for primary and alternate DNS servers are configured for a connection 
with a static IPv4 address configuration. You can also configure addresses for primary and alternate 
DNS servers even when the connection is configured to obtain an IPv4 address automatically (using 
DHCP). 
As Figure 9-2 shows, you can also specify the IPv4 addresses of a primary and an alternate DNS 
server when you configure an alternate configuration (for example, so that you can seamlessly operate 
your laptop computer on a work network that uses DHCP and on a home network that uses static IPv4 
configuration).

Figure 9-2  Primary and alternate DNS servers on the Alternate Configuration tab 
The example in Figure 9-2 shows the configuration of a primary DNS server corresponding to an 
Internet gateway device (IGD) on a home network. The IGD is acting as a DNS server for all of the 
computers on the home network.  
To manually configure the IPv4 addresses of more than two DNS servers or to configure additional 
DNS Client service settings for a connection, open the Network Connections folder, right-click the 
connection, and click Properties. Then click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet 
Protocol (TCP/IP) without clearing its check box, click Properties, click Advanced, and click the DNS 
tab. Figure 9-3 shows an example of the DNS tab. 
Figure 9-3  The DNS tab from the advanced configuration of Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) 
From the DNS tab, you can configure the following: 
Chapter 9 – Windows Support for DNS 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 246 
DNS server addresses, in order of use  Lists one or more DNS servers that the computer queries, in 
order. If you want to manually configure more than two DNS servers, you must add them to this list and 
configure their order. 
Append primary and connection-specific DNS suffixes  Specifies whether you want to use the 
primary and connection-specific DNS suffixes to attempt to resolve unqualified names. An unqualified 
name has no trailing period, such as "dev.example". In contrast, a fully qualified name has a trailing 
period, such as "dev.example.com." The primary DNS suffix is assigned to the computer and configured 
from the Computer Name tab of the System item in Control Panel. Connection-specific DNS suffixes 
are assigned to each connection, either manually or through the DNS Domain Name DHCP option. For 
more information about the name resolution process, see the “Name Resolution Behavior” section of 
this chapter. 
Append parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix  Specifies that during name resolution, the DNS 
Client service uses the parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix, up to the second-level domain, in an 
attempt to resolve unqualified host names. 
Append these DNS suffixes  Specifies a list of DNS suffixes to try during name resolution, instead of 
the primary and connection-specific DNS suffixes. 
DNS suffix for this connection  Specifies a DNS suffix for this specific connection. The DNS Client 
service uses the connection-specific suffix to identify this connection on the computer, whereas the 
DNS Client service uses the primary suffix to identify the computer regardless of the connection. If you 
specify a DNS suffix, the DNS Client service ignores the DNS suffix obtained through the DNS Domain 
Name DHCP option. 
Register this connection’s addresses in DNS  Specifies that the DNS Client service uses DNS 
dynamic update to register the IP addresses of this connection with the primary name of the computer, 
which consists of the computer name combined with the primary suffix.  
Use this connection’s DNS suffix in DNS registration  Specifies that the DNS Client service uses 
DNS dynamic update to register the IP addresses of this connection with the name of the connection—
the computer name combined with the connection-specific suffix—in addition to the primary name of the 
computer.  
To manually configure the DNS Client service in Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 for the IPv6 
addresses of DNS servers on a specific connection, obtain the properties of the Internet Protocol 
Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) component for the network connection. You can configure the following DNS 
Client service settings from the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) component: 
Primary and alternate DNS server IPv6 addresses for the connection. 
Advanced DNS client properties. 
For the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) component, configuration of the IPv6 addresses of DNS 
servers and advanced DNS client properties is very similar to IPv4.  
Manual Configuration Using Netsh 
You can also configure DNS server settings for the DNS Client service from the command line using 
the netsh interface ipv4 set dnsserver or netsh interface ip set dns commands.  
Chapter 9 – Windows Support for DNS 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 247 
By default, the DNS Client service uses IPv4 for all DNS messages. For computers running Windows 
Vista or Windows Server 2008, use the following command: 
netsh interface ipv6 set dnsserver [name=]String [source=]dhcp|static [addr=]IPv6Address|none  
[[register=]none|primary|both] 
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not support DNS traffic over IPv6. 
Configuration for Remote Access Clients 
Dial-up or virtual private network-based remote access clients running Windows Vista, Windows Server 
2008, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 obtain the initial configuration of a primary and alternate 
DNS server during the negotiation of the Point-to-Point (PPP) connection. The PPP negotiation 
includes the Primary DNS Server Address and Secondary DNS Server Address options in the Internet 
Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) as specified in RFC 1877.  
Remote access clients running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows 
Server 2003 also use a DHCPInform message to obtain an updated list of DNS servers and the DNS 
domain name. If the remote access server running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 is 
correctly configured with the DHCP Relay Agent routing protocol component, it forwards the 
DHCPInform message to a DHCP server and forwards the response (a DHCPAck message) back to 
the remote access client. 
If the remote access client receives a response to the DHCPInform message, the DNS servers 
contained in the DHCPAck message replace the DNS servers configured during the PPP connection 
negotiation. 
Configuration of DNS Settings Using Group Policy 
You can also configure DNS settings using Computer Configuration Group Policy and the Group Policy 
Object Editor snap-in. By using this snap-in, you can modify Group Policy objects for system containers 
(such as sites, domains, or organizational units) within Active Directory. To configure DNS settings, 
open the Group Policy Object Editor snap-in, and click the Computer Configuration\Administrative 
Templates\Network\DNS Client node in the tree, as Figure 9-4 shows.

Page: 248 
Figure 9-4  DNS settings in Computer Configuration Group Policy 
Group Policy-based DNS settings override the equivalent settings configured on the local computer or 
through DHCP. 
Name Resolution Behavior 
When an application uses the getaddrinfo() or gethostbyname() Windows Sockets functions, the 
resolver component of the DNS Client service performs name resolution as described in Chapter 7, 
“Host Name Resolution.” The DNS Client service checks the local host name and the local DNS client 
resolver cache, and then the service sends out DNS Name Query Request messages.  
If DNS name resolution fails and the name is longer than 15 bytes, name resolution fails and TCP/IP for 
Windows indicates the error condition to the application. If the name is 15 bytes or shorter in length, the 
resolver verifies whether NetBIOS over TCP/IP is enabled. If it is not enabled, name resolution fails. If 
NetBIOS is enabled, the resolver converts the name to a NetBIOS name and attempts NetBIOS name 
resolution. 
Before the resolver sends any DNS Name Query Request messages, it determines the type of name to 
resolve. An application can submit one of the following types of names: 
Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) 
Names that are terminated with a period, indicating the name relative to the root domain of the 
DNS. For example, host7.example.com. is an FQDN. 
Single-label, unqualified domain names  
Names that consist of a single label and contain no periods. For example host7 is a single-label, 
unqualified domain name. 
Multiple-label, unqualified domain names  
Names that contain more than one label and one or more periods but are not terminated with a 
period. For example, host7.example or example.com are multiple-label, unqualified domain names. 
Name Resolution for FQDNs 
When the application specifies an FQDN, the resolver queries DNS using that name. No other 
combinations are tried. 
Name Resolution for Single-Label, Unqualified Domain Names 
When the application specifies a single-label, unqualified domain name, the resolver systematically 
appends different DNS suffixes to the single-label, unqualified domain name; adds periods to make 
them FQDNs; and submits them to DNS for name resolution. The resolver appends the DNS suffixes to
