**Current behavior**  
Consider the following minimal router set up
    {
            path: '', component: Component1,
            children: [
                { path: 'route1', loadChildren:() =>  Module1  },
            ]
        }
    ]
The JIT compiler fails at **angular/core/bundles/core.umd.js line 2049**
because arrow functions do not have the prototype property.
Changing the lazy loading to use the es5 function syntax solves the problem
**Expected behavior**  
Should be able to use es6 arrow function for lazy loading a module
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
  * Create an angular project using version 2.4.10
  * Add a router config that includes loadChildren using arrow function
  * Run `npm start`
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Since angular supports es6, we should be allowed to take advantage of arrow
function definition for lazy loading
