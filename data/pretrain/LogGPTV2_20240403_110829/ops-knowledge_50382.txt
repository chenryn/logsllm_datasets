User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释There are a few lines of logs as follows
 0 14:41:57 combo Detected 731.219 MHz processor.
 1 14:41:57 combo mapped 4G/4G trampoline to ffff3000.
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>) 和 ALERT exited abnormally with [1]
B: check pass; user unknown 和 session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>)
C: mapped 4G/4G trampoline to <*>. 和 Detected <*>.<*> MHz processor.
D: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>)
