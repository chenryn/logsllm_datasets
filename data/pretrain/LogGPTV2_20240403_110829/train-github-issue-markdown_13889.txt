Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the text:

**Example:**
[http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html)

In the **Attributes** section, the following description is provided for `nnz`:

> **nnz**: Get the count of explicitly-stored values (nonzeros).

**Parameters:**
- **axis**: None, 0, or 1
  - Select between the number of values across the entire matrix, in each column, or in each row, respectively.

First, it appears that a period is needed after "nonzeros" to ensure proper rendering. Additionally, the list of parameters for `nnz` seems to duplicate the one for `getnnz`.

This version is clearer, more structured, and maintains a professional tone.
