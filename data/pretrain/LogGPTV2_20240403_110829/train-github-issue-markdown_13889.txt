E.g.
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.17.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html  
In the Attributes section, one has:
> nnz Get the count of explicitly-stored values (nonzeros) :Parameters: axis :
> None, 0, or 1 Select  
>  between the number of values across the whole matrix, in each column, or in
> each row.
First, it seems to need the full stop after (nonzeros) to render correctly
(same for `getnnz`). Second, the list of Parameters seems to duplicate the one
for `getnnz`.
