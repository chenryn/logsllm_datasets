User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Certification Authority Service starts and stops SBS 2008 We moved from a SBS 2003 Server to a SBS 2008 server relatively recently because the SBS 2003 was having major hardware issues.  I followed the Migration guide to the letter and everything seemed to go smooth.  Until after this last update.  I noticed that AD Certificate service was not started... I started it and it stopped immediately. So I went to Certification Authority MMC and tried to start the service from there and got the following:


  Error 0xxc8000147 (ESE: -327)


So went to the error log and here the associated log:


  Log Name:      Application         Source:

Assistant: I recommend removing and reinstalling the Certificate Authority role.  This is expressly supported by MS and they even provide an SBS2008 HOWTO here.
