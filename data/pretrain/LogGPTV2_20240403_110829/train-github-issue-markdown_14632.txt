After recompiling TensorFlow, I encountered the following log message:

```
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing LAYER_NAME_UIDS.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
'dict' object has no attribute 'name'
```

This warning does not appear to affect any of the computations, and all other tools are functioning as expected.
