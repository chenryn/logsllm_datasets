I've been building an entire application to get my hands wet with deno. It's
great so far. Thank you everyone for your hard work and contributions.
A main development pain point I experience is importing new packages. I have
to visit the package documentation, and get the url. Even for packages I have
already used, I have to go to the documentation every time to copy the really
long url.
Now most of us deno users would be coming from npm, so it'd be more productive
to be able to use common packages without having to visit documentations all
the time to copy the url.
With node, I could just `npm i express`, then `require('express')`, because
`express` is easy to remember.
My suggestion is to have similar functionality with deno. We could have an
alias for urls. For example, `import * as log from 'log'` resolves to `import
* as log from 'https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts'`. Deno just resolves the
alias behind the scenes.
I hope the suggestion makes sense. Looking forward to what you think, or any
drawbacks and feedback. Thanks !
