Subject: Suggestion for Simplifying Package Imports in Deno

Dear Deno Community,

I am currently developing an application using Deno, and I must say, it has been a fantastic experience so far. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone involved for their hard work and contributions.

One of the main challenges I have encountered during development is the process of importing new packages. Every time I need to use a package, even if it's one I've used before, I find myself visiting the package documentation to copy the URL, which can often be quite lengthy. This process can be time-consuming and disrupts the workflow, especially when compared to the ease of using npm with Node.js.

In Node.js, I can simply run `npm i express` and then `require('express')`, as 'express' is easy to remember. This streamlined approach significantly enhances productivity.

To address this issue in Deno, I propose introducing an aliasing system for URLs. For example, instead of writing:

```typescript
import * as log from 'https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts';
```

We could write:

```typescript
import * as log from 'log';
```

Deno would then resolve the alias `'log'` to the full URL `'https://deno.land/std/log/mod.ts'` behind the scenes. This would make the import process more user-friendly and efficient, especially for those transitioning from npm.

I hope this suggestion makes sense and contributes to improving the developer experience with Deno. I look forward to hearing your thoughts, feedback, and any potential drawbacks you may see with this approach.

Thank you for your consideration!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
