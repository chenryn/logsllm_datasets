### What problem does this feature solve?
Having multiple event handlers that call the very same function add noise to
the templates.  
I propose to DRY that a bit.
### What does the proposed API look like?
Currently you can pass multiple functions to a single event handler like so:
However, I think it would be really handy to be able to do the inverse, ie.
passing the same function to multiple event handlers.  
Today for instance I have to do this:
It would be great if you could instead do that:
That way you can more clearly see in one glance how many different behavior
are attached to a component. Also, modifying the callbacks is easier.
