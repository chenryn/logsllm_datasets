I am looking for the best approach to manage multiple parallel SSH connections in Python. Specifically, I need to establish several SSH connections that remain active in the background, allowing me to send commands either interactively or in scheduled batches.

Is it possible to achieve this using the Paramiko library? Ideally, I would like to avoid spawning a separate SSH process for each connection.

Thank you.

You can indeed use the Paramiko library to manage multiple parallel SSH connections in Python without spawning separate SSH processes. Paramiko is well-suited for this task and provides a robust way to handle SSH connections programmatically.

Here’s a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:

1. **Establish Multiple Connections**: Use a loop to create and store multiple SSH connections.
2. **Background Management**: Keep the connections open and manage them in the background.
3. **Interactive or Scheduled Commands**: Send commands either interactively or on a schedule.

Here is a basic example to get you started:

```python
import paramiko
import threading
import time

def run_command(ssh, command):
    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(command)
    print(stdout.read().decode())
    print(stderr.read().decode())

def main():
    # List of hosts and credentials
    hosts = [
        {'host': 'hostname1', 'port': 22, 'username': 'user1', 'password': 'pass1'},
        {'host': 'hostname2', 'port': 22, 'username': 'user2', 'password': 'pass2'}
    ]

    # Create and store SSH connections
    ssh_connections = []
    for host_info in hosts:
        ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
        ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
        ssh.connect(host_info['host'], port=host_info['port'], username=host_info['username'], password=host_info['password'])
        ssh_connections.append(ssh)

    # Example: Run a command on all connections
    for ssh in ssh_connections:
        threading.Thread(target=run_command, args=(ssh, 'ls -l')).start()

    # Keep the script running to maintain the connections
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(60)  # Keep the main thread alive
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Shutting down...")

    # Close all SSH connections
    for ssh in ssh_connections:
        ssh.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script establishes multiple SSH connections, runs a command on each, and keeps the connections open in the background. You can modify the `run_command` function and the main loop to suit your specific needs, such as sending commands interactively or on a schedule.

Using cron jobs on the remote machines is another option, but if you prefer to manage everything from your Python script, Paramiko is a powerful and flexible solution.

I hope this helps!
