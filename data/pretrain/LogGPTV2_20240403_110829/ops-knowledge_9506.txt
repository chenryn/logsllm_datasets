User: I wonder what is the best way to handle parallel SSH connections in python.
I need to open several SSH connections to keep in background and to feed commands in interactive or timed batch way.
Is this possible to do it with the paramiko libraries? It would be nice not to spawn a different SSH process for each connection.
Thanks.
Assistant: You can simply use subprocess.Popen for that purpose, without any problems.
However, you might want to simply install cronjobs on the remote machines. :-)
