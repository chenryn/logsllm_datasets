User: Since Cassandra doesn't have MapReduce built in yet (I think it's coming in 0.7), is it dumb to try and MapReduce with my Python client or should I just use CouchDB or Mongo or something?
The application is stats collection, so I need to be able to sum values with grouping to increment counters. I'm not, but pretend I'm making Google analytics so I want to keep track of which browsers appear, which pages they went to, and visits vs. pageviews.
I would just atomically update my counters on write, but Cassandra isn't very good at counters either.
May Cassandra just isn't the right choice for this?
Thanks!
Assistant: Cassandra supports map reduce since version 0.6. (Current stable release is 0.5.1, but go ahead and try the new map reduce functionality in 0.6.0-beta3) To get started I recommend to take a look at the word count map reduce example in 'contrib/word_count'.
