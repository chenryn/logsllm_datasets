that the rush hour eﬀect exhibits time-of-day eﬀects [21,
23, 28]. Figure 9 shows for each day, the actual hour of day
during which the rush hour occurred. However, as Figure 9
shows, there are no discernible time-of-day eﬀects in the dis-
tribution of when rush hours occur. Further, we can visually
conﬁrm that the rush hours of Soc and Oﬀ are strongly cor-
related. For 8 out of 17 days, the rush hours of these came
within one hour of each other. These results suggests that a
ﬂash-crowd eﬀect might be occurring. We revisit these when
we analyze ﬂash crowds in-depth (Section 5).
3.3 Video Popularity in Live VoD
3.3.1 Static Popularity Patterns
Many real-world phenomena including traditional VoD
and web popularity exhibit the Pareto principle (80-20
rule) [11, 28]. We study if similar behavior manifests in
live VoD as well. To analyze this, we identify for each day,
the top- k% (k=10,20) of the videos sorted by access counts.
Then, we compute the fraction of total accesses for that day
contributed by these top-k% of the videos.
Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the percentage of accesses
contributed by the top-10% and top-20% of the videos for
Oﬀ and Soc. In the period spanning the actual games (Aug
8–24), we can see that the top 10% and top 20% of videos
contribute 80% and 90% of the total accesses for Oﬀ . As
Table 3 shows, Soc had far more viewers than Oﬀ . Inter-
estingly, with more users the popularity of videos tends to
become more skewed; the top 10% and top 20% videos at-
tracted 90% and 95% of the total accesses. We posit that
this is a consequence of the presentation model in Soc and
explore this further in Section 6.
3.3.2 Popularity Dynamics
An interesting question is how does the popularity of con-
tent change across time in such a multi-day VoD event?
Does a speciﬁc video remain “hot” over multiple days or will
it be superseded by videos pertinent to more recent events?
To analyze changes in the pattern of popular videos, we
compute the set of top-k (e.g., k=5, 10, 20, 100) videos and
understand how this set changes daily. To quantify the churn
(i.e., how dynamically does the popular content change), we
deﬁne the change-per-day percentage (CDP ) across the top-
k videos (for k=5, 10, 20, 100). Let P k
i denote the set of
top-k popular videos on day i. Then the top-k change per
day percentage for day i, CDP i(k), is deﬁned as:
CDP i(k) =
|P k
i − P k
i−1|
k
× 100%
(1)
Figures 11(a) and 11(b) show the CDP (5 ), CDP (10 ),
CDP (20 ), and CDP (100 ),from August 7 to August 31, for
Oﬀ and Soc. From these results, we make three main ob-
servations:
1. The popular content changes frequently. Between Aug
8 and Aug 25, CDP (5 ) is almost 100%, which means
that the top-5 videos were completely new. These hold
for CDP (10 ) and CDP (20 ) as well. Even CDP (100 )
is 55% for Oﬀ and 70% for Soc. Measurements from
traditional VoD systems have typically reported values
in the range of 16% to 30% for CDP (10 ) and 12%
to 16% for CDP (100 ) [28]. This suggests that the
real-time, event-driven nature results in the popular
content changing more dynamically.
2. Certain events can keep users attention for a long time.
For example, the churn in popular content is quite low
on August 9 and August 19. Recall that these were
immediately following two main events: the opening
ceremony and Liu Xiang’s withdrawal. These events,
one anticipated and one unexpected, attracted the at-
tention of a large number quantity of viewers.
3. We see an immediate and signiﬁcant drop in the CDP
values in the post-games period. The videos published
during this time were mostly retrospective videos with
little real-time impact and thus do not attract many
users. In fact, in this period, the CDP values almost
revert to those observed in traditional VoD systems.
3.4 Observations
The nature of the Olympics workload – real-time, event-
driven videos means that the durations, access patterns, and
popularity dynamics are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from tradi-
tional VoD and UGC systems. From the above results, we
highlight three key observations:
1. Video lengths show signiﬁcantly more diversity com-
pared to traditional VoD systems. A natural question
therefore is if user behavior was aﬀected by the video
lengths. We analyze this in the next section.

2. There are noticeable ﬂash crowd like eﬀects in live VoD
which are not typical of traditional VoD systems. We
present case studies to better understand ﬂash-crowd
eﬀects in Section 5.
3. Popular content changes signiﬁcantly more rapidly
than traditional VoD. This is a natural consequence of
the event-driven nature of the content; recent events
supersede past events in popularity.
4. Additionally, we observe that Soc shows more skew in
content popularity. This suggest that the presentation
model can aﬀect access patterns; we explore this fur-
ther in Section 6.
4. UNDERSTANDING USER BEHAVIOR
There are two features that distinguish the Olympics VoD
system from traditional VoD and UGC systems. First, the
system features a much wider distribution of video dura-
tions. Second, the system provides users with streaming
capabilities (e.g., seek, pause) operations.3 In this section,
we understand how these impact user access patterns.
3Earlier versions of UGC sites did not provide these capa-
bilities. Recently, they have retroﬁtted these features to
traditional HTTP delivery.
Figure 9: When did the rush hours occur?
4.1
Impact of Video Length on User Behavior
We deﬁne the viewing percentage as the fraction of a video
duration taken up by each session (after accounting for pause
intervals). For example, if the video was 100 seconds long
and the session lasted 75 seconds, the viewing percentage
would be 75%. (There is a possibility that the user replayed
some earlier portion of the video. This might result in over-
estimating the viewing percentage. However, as we show in
Section 4.3, most sessions had no seek actions. Thus, the
viewing percentages are accurate.) We select ﬁve distinct
video lengths: 60, 120, 300, 602 and 1812 seconds, and plot
the CDF of the viewing percentage of these ﬁve classes in
Figure 12. A general trend is that the viewing percentage is
inversely proportional to the video duration. For example,
for 120-second videos, more than 80% sessions have viewed
at least 80% of the video. For the 1812-second videos, 70%
of the sessions viewed less than 20% of the video.
4.2 Session Times
Figure 13 shows the distribution of session times for the
three providers. We see that more than 80% of the ses-
sions have a viewing time under 600 seconds across all three
providers. This is surprising, considering that Oﬀ had sig-
niﬁcant diversity in video durations. To understand this fur-
ther, we show in Figure 14 the viewing duration as a function

20, and 100 videos
of video length. For each video length, it shows the aver-
age, min, and max values across all sessions that accessed
videos of that length. We see that for low video lengths, the
viewing time is strongly correlated with the length. How-
ever, as the video length increases, this correlation weakens
signiﬁcantly. For example, 96% of the videos longer than 20
minutes have an average viewing duration less than under
400 seconds. 73% of such videos in fact only have a viewing
duration between 200 and 400 seconds.
4.3 Do Viewers Use Streaming Capabilities?
For each session, we count the number of user actions be-
tween the “play” and “stop” events. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that
around 80% of the sessions have no user operations (i.e., no
pause or seek behavior). This eﬀect has also been reported
in previous measurement s studies [20], in which the per-
centage of sessions without interactivity were between 60%
to 80%. This result is relevant for two reasons. First, even
though users had these capabilities, they chose to not ex-
ercise these functions. Second, for the earlier results, we
deﬁned the viewing duration as the length of the session:
the time from the user hit play to the user pressing stop and
subtracting any intervals of pause action. However, it is pos-
sible that there were seek operations; this could mean that
some parts of the video might have been replayed. Since we
ﬁnd that most videos had no seek operations, our deﬁnition
of viewing duration is still valid.
4.4
Implications of User Behavior
There are two interesting observations from our study of
user behavior: (1) most sessions last less than 600 seconds
irrespective of the actual video duration and (2) users did
not exercise the streaming functions to seek or pause videos.
We derive two implications from these observations:
1. The vast majority of viewers only see the ﬁrst 600 sec-
onds of most videos. This can guide the design of more
eﬀective caching mechanisms – it is better to cache the
initial segments of many videos instead of caching large
videos in their entirety.
2. Since most users do not appear to use the streaming
capabilities, simpler delivery modes (e.g., HTTP deliv-
ery as used by current VoD mechanisms) might suﬃce,
without adversely aﬀecting the users’ viewing experi-
ence. Some UGC sites have modiﬁed their delivery
techniques to retroﬁt streaming functionality; it would
be interesting to see if and how users utilize these ca-
pabilities.

5. ANALYSIS OF FLASH CROWDS
Traditional VoD or UGC systems do not exhibit ﬂash
crowd like phenomena. However, in the earlier measure-
ment results, the distinct spikes in the number of accesses
per hour (Figures 7(a) and 7(b)), the large contribution of
accesses by the rush hour (Figure 8), the rapidly changing
proﬁle of popular videos (Figure 11), and the strong corre-
lation in when the rush hour occurred across Soc and Oﬀ
(Figure 9), together strongly indicate ﬂash-crowd eﬀects.
In this section, we present a more in-depth understanding
of ﬂash-crowd phenomena in the live VoD context. First, we
correlate the observed large ﬂash crowds with actual events
during the Olympics to conﬁrm that there was indeed such
ﬂash-crowd eﬀect. Next, we take three ﬂash crowds as case
studies to understand (a) if the ﬂash crowd spanned multiple
videos and (b) the eﬀect of publish time on videos consti-
tuting a ﬂash crowd.
5.1 What Triggered Flash Crowds?
To understand which speciﬁc events triggered ﬂash
crowds, we look at the rush hours with the largest num-
ber of accesses from Figures 8 and 9. For each rush hour,
we identify the top-10 videos and manually ﬁnd the most
common real-world event that relates videos within this set.
Using this approach, we annotate each ﬂash crowd. Table 4
shows the events identiﬁed from Soc and Oﬀ . Unsurpris-
ingly, given that the users in our dataset are based in China,
we see a bias toward events involving popular Chinese ath-
letes or team events.
5.2 Correlated Accesses in a Flash Crowd
Next, we analyze one speciﬁc ﬂash crowd that occurred
at 12:00 pm on Aug 13. We picked this speciﬁcally because
this was the rush hour with the most accesses in Soc and the
entire dataset (Figure 7). We selected the top 5 videos in
terms of number of accesses and found that all videos were
for the same event: Chinese women gymnasts won their ﬁrst
ever Olympic team gold medal.
Figure 15 shows the number of accesses per-minute for
these 5 videos. The earliest video, video 1, was released
at 10:31, and videos 2 to 5 were released at 11:22, 11:43,
12:15 and 12:21. Each video was a segment of the actual
gymnastics event and video 3 was the segment in which the
Chinese team actually won the gold medal. We see that the
early videos continue to attract a large number of uses till
12:25. In this case, the correlations arise naturally since all
the videos are segments of the same logical event.
