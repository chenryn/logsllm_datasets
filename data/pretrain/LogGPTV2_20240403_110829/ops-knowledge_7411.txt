User: How can I run a python script in Terminal on Mac without using the "python" keyword, without having to edit my existing python files?
Right now I have to do this:
python script.py
What I like to do is this:
script.py
Assistant: Try ./script.py instead of script.py ... or ensure your current directory is in your path and script.py should work....
