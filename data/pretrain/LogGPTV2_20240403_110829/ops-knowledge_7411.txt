To run a Python script in the Terminal on a Mac without explicitly using the `python` keyword and without modifying your existing Python files, you can follow these steps:

1. **Make the Script Executable:**
   First, ensure that your script has executable permissions. You can do this by running the following command in the Terminal:
   ```sh
   chmod +x script.py
   ```

2. **Add a Shebang Line:**
   Add a shebang line at the very top of your `script.py` file to specify the interpreter. This line should be the first line in your script. For Python 3, it would look like this:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   Now, you can run the script by simply typing:
   ```sh
   ./script.py
   ```

Alternatively, if you want to run the script without the `./` prefix, you need to add the current directory (or the directory containing your script) to your system's `PATH` environment variable. However, adding the current directory to the `PATH` is generally not recommended for security reasons.

If you still prefer to do so, you can temporarily add the current directory to the `PATH` by running:
```sh
export PATH="$PWD:$PATH"
```
Then, you can run the script with:
```sh
script.py
```

However, this change will only last for the duration of the current terminal session. To make it permanent, you would need to add the `export` command to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.), but again, this is not recommended for security reasons.

By following the first two steps, you can run your script with `./script.py` in a secure and standard way.
