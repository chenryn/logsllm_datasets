One of these is not like the others...
“The S&G 6730 ... has only a +/- .5 dialing 
tolerance, essentially giving a 1 digit window to 
hit. While many locksmiths might prefer the S&G 
6730, it can be notoriously difficult to open and 
very unforgiving to human error. In addition, slight 
alterations to the lock (for example, if the dial or 
the dial ring was bumped during shipping) can 
shift the combination, rendering the lock 
unusable.”
