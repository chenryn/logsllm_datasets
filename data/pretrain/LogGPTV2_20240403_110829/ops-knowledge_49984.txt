I am running Ubuntu 14.04 with GNOME 3.8.4 on a 15-inch MacBook Pro in a dual-boot setup. I am new to both Linux and Python (using PyCharm IDE). I have downloaded the PyCharm files from the Software Center, but I am unable to run the program. The icon appears in the sidebar, but when I click it, nothing happens. I have also tried using `./` in the terminal, but only the code appears in gedit. Oracle Java is already installed. Can you help me?

Hello Pedro,

In Ubuntu, even after downloading the software, you need to install it using the command line. Unlike Windows, where installation is often automatic, in Linux, you typically need to manually install downloaded software using specific commands.

Hereâ€™s how you can install PyCharm:

1. **Open the Terminal**: You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or searching for "Terminal" in your application menu.

2. **Navigate to the Download Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you downloaded the PyCharm files. For example:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/downloaded/files
   ```

3. **Make the Installer Executable**: If the file is a `.sh` script, you need to make it executable. For example, if the file is named `pycharm.sh`, use:
   ```bash
   chmod +x pycharm.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Installer**: Execute the script to start the installation process:
   ```bash
   ./pycharm.sh
   ```

If you are still having issues, you can follow a more detailed guide [here](http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-pycharm-3-4-on-ubuntu-14-04-linux-mint-17-pinguy-os-14-04-and-other-ubuntu-14-04-derivatives/).

Additionally, ensure that all dependencies are met and that Oracle Java is correctly installed and configured. You can check the Java version by running:
```bash
java -version
```

If you encounter any errors during these steps, please provide the error messages, and I can assist you further.
