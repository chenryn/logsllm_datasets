Assistant: hi Pedro in ubuntu you need to install the files using the command prompt even if you downloaded the files you need to install them using command, unlike windows in linux when some software is downloaded you need to install them manually by using commands like sudo apt-get python install..
for further help you can consult http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-pycharm-3-4-on-ubuntu-14-04-linux-mint-17-pinguy-os-14-04-and-other-ubuntu-14-04-derivatives/
