APPENDIX E: FASCSA46 
INTRODUCTION 
Purpose, Audience, and Background  
This Appendix augments the content in NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1 and provides additional 
guidance specific to federal executive agencies related to supply chain risk assessment factors, 
assessment documentation, risk severity levels, and risk response.  
As discussed in the introductory section of the main body of SP 800-161, Rev 1., The Federal 
Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (FASCSA), Title II of the SECURE Technology 
Act (P. L. 115-390), was enacted to improve executive branch coordination, supply chain risk 
information (SCRI) sharing, and actions to address supply chain risks. The law established the 
Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC),47 an interagency executive body at the federal 
enterprise level. This council is authorized to perform a range of functions intended to reduce the 
Federal Government’s supply chain risk exposure and risk impact. 
The FASCSA provides the FASC and executive agencies with authorities relating to mitigating 
supply chain risks, to include the exclusion and/or removal of sources and covered articles.48 The 
law also mandates that agencies conduct and prioritize supply chain risk assessments (SCRAs). 
The guidance in this appendix is specific to this FASCSA requirement, as described below, and 
addresses the need for a baseline level of consistency and alignment between agency-level C-
SCRM risk assessment and response functions and those SCRM functions that occur at the 
government-wide level by authorized bodies such as the FASC. 
Scope  
IN SCOPE 
This appendix is primarily focused on providing agencies with additional guidance concerning 
Section 1326 (a) (1) of the FASCSA,49 which requires executive agencies to assess the supply 
chain risk posed by the acquisition and use of covered articles and to respond to that risk as 
appropriate. The law directs agencies to perform this activity and other SCRM activities 
described therein, consistent with NIST standards, guidelines, and practices.  
OUT OF SCOPE 
Section 4713 of the FASCSA50 pertains to executive agencies’ authority to carry out covered 
procurement actions. Specific guidance concerning those actions is outside of the scope of this 
46 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
47 For additional information about the FASC authorities, membership, functions, and processes, readers should refer to the Federal Acquisition 
Security Council Final Rule, 41 CFR Parts 201 and 201-1. See: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-08-26/pdf/2021-17532.pdf.  
48 As defined by FASCSA, a covered article means: Information technology, including cloud computing services of all types; telecommunications 
equipment or telecommunications services; the processing of information on a federal or non-federal information system, subject to the 
requirements of the Controlled Unclassified Information program; all IoT/OT (e.g., hardware, systems, devices, software, or services that include 
embedded or incidental information technology).

appendix. The FASCSA requires the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council to prescribe 
such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section. NIST does and will continue to 
work closely with interagency colleagues within the FASC and the federal acquisition 
community to help ensure harmonized guidance.   
This appendix does not provide guidance on how to conduct an assessment, which is best 
addressed through role-based training, education, and work experience. NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, 
Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, is also a recommended reference. Agencies should take 
steps to ensure that personnel with current and prospective responsibilities for performing 
SCRAs have adequate skills, knowledge, and depth and breadth of experience sufficient to 
identify and discern indications of cybersecurity risk in the supply chain and the assessment of 
those risks. Agencies are strongly encouraged to invest in training to grow and sustain 
competencies in analytic skills and SCRM knowledge. Counter-intelligence and security training 
are also strongly recommended for C-SCRM PMO staff or those personnel with responsibilities 
dedicated to performing SCRAs. Building this capability helps to ensure that there is sufficient 
understanding and awareness of adversarial-related supply chain risks in the workforce while 
also developing a risk management cadre to provide advice and support for risk response 
decisions and actions. 
Relationship to NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1, Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management 
Practices for Systems and Organizations 
The practices and processes to assess, respond to, and otherwise manage cybersecurity risks in 
the supply chain are discussed at length throughout the main body and appendices of NIST SP 
800-161, Rev. 1. This appendix provides supplemental expanded guidance that is tailored and 
applicable to federal agencies. This guidance describes the scope and type of supply chain risk 
assessment information and documentation used to support and advise risk response decisions 
and actions, both internally to senior agency officials and externally to bodies such as the FASC. 
This augmented guidance is also intended to ensure a baseline consistency and sufficiency of 
processes and SCRI utilized for assessment and documentation and to facilitate information 
sharing and recommendations to applicable decision makers, whether at a given agency or at the 
government-wide level. Within the constraints of requisite support for federal enterprise-level 
analysis and decision-making, agencies continue to have the flexibility to assess and manage 
their supply risk in a manner consistent with the broader guidance outlined in the main body and 
other appendices of NIST SP 800-161, Rev.1 and their policies, mission and priority needs, and 
existing practices (to the extent that these are sufficient).

FASCSA Supply Chain Risk Definition vs. NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1, Cybersecurity-Supply 
Chain Risk Definition 
Agencies should take note that the FASCSA definition of supply chain risk is narrowly focused 
on risk that arises from an assessment that there is intent and capability by an adversarial threat 
actor to conduct malicious activity or otherwise cause malicious harm. In contrast, NIST’s 
definition and scope of cybersecurity supply chain risk is otherwise consistent with the FASCSA 
definition but broader in scope as it includes both adversarial and non-adversarial-related risks. 
Consistent with the FASCSA’s direction that agencies rely upon NIST standards and guidance, 
agencies need to ensure that their assessment and risk response activities address all applicable 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.  
SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ASSESSMENTS (SCRAs) 
General Information  
The FASCSA requires agencies to conduct and prioritize supply chain risk assessments when 
acquiring a covered article as well during its use or performance. In most cases, this also 
compels the need to assess the source associated with the covered article. Supply chain risk 
assessments conducted by agencies are highly dependent on the operating environment and use 
case associated with a covered article. Agencies have flexibility in how they apply NIST 
guidelines to their operations and there is not – nor should there be – a one-size-fits-all approach 
to conducting a SCRA. However, to facilitate assessments that may need to take place at the 
government-wide level to evaluate risks that may impact national security or multiple agency 
missions, there is a need to ensure that agencies’ SCRA information and documentation reflect 
an acceptable baseline level of due diligence and standardization. 
In general, information used for an assessment will be comprised of up to three categories of 
inputs: 
1) Purpose and context information (i.e., use-case specific) used to understand the risk 
environment and to inform and establish risk tolerance relative to the use case 
2) Data or information obtained from the source 
3) All-source information, which may come from publicly available data, government sources 
(may include classified sources), and/or commercial fee-based sources 
The purpose and context, as well as when an assessment of a supplier and/or covered article is 
performed in the SDLC or procurement life cycle, will drive variations in terms of focus and 
scope with regard to what type, how much, and from what sources information used in an 
assessment is obtained. 
The FASCSA recognizes that agencies have constrained resources, but it is necessary to 
prioritize the conduct of SCRAs.51 Prioritization is not meant to be understood as only a subset 
of sources or covered articles that should be assessed. Rather, agencies should establish a tiered 
51 See Section 1326 (a)(2) of the FASCSA.

set of priority levels commensurate with the criticality and potential for risk impact. This tiering 
can then be used to guide or compel the timing of, order, scope, and frequency of SCRAs.  
In addition to externally driven priorities (e.g., government-wide policy direction, regulatory 
requirement, etc.) and agency-defined prioritization factors, NIST SP 800-161, Rev 1. instructs 
agencies to prioritize assessments concerning critical suppliers (i.e., sources) and critical systems 
and services, as compromise of these sources and covered articles is likely to result in greater 
harm than something determined to be non-critical. For these assessments, agencies should 
address all baseline risk factors described in the Baseline Risk Factors (common, minimal) 
section below (augmenting and weighing the factors, as appropriate to the use case, to ensure 
appropriate consideration of both adversarial and non-adversarial-related risks). For a given non-
critical source or non-critical covered article, agencies have discretion – consistent with their 
own internal policies and practices and absent other mandates – as to whether all, some, and to 
what extent the baseline risk factors described in this appendix should be considered when 
assessing supply chain risk. However, if and when there are one or more credible findings that 
indicate that a substantial supply chain risk may or does exist (see Supply Chain Risk Severity 
Schema, described below), it may require that a more comprehensive assessment be completed, 
inclusive of all of the baseline risk factors or more robust research and analysis of the baseline 
risk factors. (See the risk response guidance described in the Risk Response Section below.) 
The responsibility and accountability for determining the priority levels for SCRAs, evaluating 
impact, making risk response decisions, and taking actions based on the findings in a SCRA are 
inherently governmental functions and cannot be outsourced. However, some agencies may rely 
on a qualified third party for support in conducting research, documenting findings, and 
reviewing relevant information. To aid in their research and assessment activities, agencies may 
also acquire access to commercially available data or tools. Appropriate requirements should be 
included in solicitations and contracts to address access to, handling, and safeguarding SCRI. 
Failure to do this, in and of itself, reflects a security control gap and creates an unmitigated 
supply chain risk. Moreover, such a gap can undermine the entire purpose of an agency’s SCRA 
efforts or even facilitate the success of foreign adversaries’ malicious actions against the United 
States. Additionally, agency personnel should follow the guidance and direction of their ethics 
officials and legal counsel to ensure that protections are in place to guard against conflicts of 
interest and inappropriate or unauthorized access to or disclosure of information, as SCRI may 
be sensitive, proprietary, or – in certain instances – classified. For the latter category of 
information, agencies must ensure adherence to laws, policies, and procedures governing 
classified information and limit access to only those personnel who have the proper clearance, 
authorized access, and need to know.  
In all instances, personnel who support the conduct of an assessment have a duty and 
responsibility to act prudently and objectively and to exercise reasonable care in researching and 
analyzing a source or covered article as this SCRI underpins subsequent risk response decisions 
and actions. 
Baseline Risk Factors (Common, Minimal) 
This section describes the baseline (common, non-exclusive) supply chain risk factors and 
guidance that agencies should incorporate into (or map to the factors included in) their agency-

defined SCRA methodology. These factors are to be used as a guide to research, identify, and 
assess risk for those SCRAs pertaining to critical sources or critical covered articles, at a 
minimum. A common baseline of risk factors also helps to ensure that due diligence is 
consistently conducted as part of the analysis that informs risk response decisions and actions, 
whether these occur at various levels within an agency or at the federal enterprise-level. 
Agencies should assess additional factors beyond the baseline factors, as deemed relevant and 
appropriate to a given assessment use case. 
Objectives for establishing this baseline set of factors include: 
• Level setting evaluations for sources and covered articles;  
• Ensuring that the minimum necessary information is available to the FASC, when 
required; 
• Promoting consistency and comparability across agencies;  
• Aiding the conduct of more sophisticated analyses, such as trend analysis or causal or 
correlation relationships between identified indicators of risk and realized risks; and 
• Establishing and maintaining a base of information sufficient to identify and understand 
potential mitigation options and inform prioritization or risk response trade-off 
analysis/decisions.   
Table E-1 that follows includes a list of the baseline risk factors and their corresponding 
definition or description. These factors are also consistent with and align to the factors included 
in the FASC Final Rule.52 The right-most column includes a list of the type of information that 
may be identified and found to be an indicator of risk. This list is intended to be used as a 
reference aid and is not all-inclusive of the possible indicators of risk. Information that pertains 
to context-based risk factors should be known by the agency and is often already documented 
(e.g., in a system security plan or acquisition plan). An assessment of these use case-specific and 
context-based factors helps to understand inherent risk,53 guides the identification and selection 
of needed cybersecurity and SCRM controls and procurement requirements, and aids in 
determining the risk tolerance threshold for a covered article associated with a given use case.  
The next set of vulnerability and threat risk factors is focused on risk that may be inherited from 
the covered article itself or the associated source or supply chain. Agencies will assess the 
findings associated with these baseline (and any additional) factors to provide an informed 
judgment about whether there are indications of threat from an adversarial threat actor, the 
likelihood for compromise or harm and resultant impact, and whether the assessed risk 
pertaining to a source and/or covered article is within or exceeds their acceptable risk tolerance 
level.
