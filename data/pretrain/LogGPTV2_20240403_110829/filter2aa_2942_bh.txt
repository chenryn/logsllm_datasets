### Appendix E: FASCSA Guidance

#### Introduction
**Purpose, Audience, and Background**

This appendix supplements the content in NIST SP 800-161, Revision 1, providing additional guidance specific to federal executive agencies on supply chain risk assessment factors, documentation, risk severity levels, and risk response. The Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (FASCSA), Title II of the SECURE Technology Act (P.L. 115-390), was enacted to enhance executive branch coordination, information sharing, and actions to mitigate supply chain risks. The law established the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC), an interagency body at the federal enterprise level, with the authority to reduce the Federal Government’s supply chain risk exposure.

The FASCSA grants the FASC and executive agencies the authority to mitigate supply chain risks, including the exclusion and removal of sources and covered articles. The law also mandates that agencies conduct and prioritize supply chain risk assessments (SCRAs). This appendix provides guidance tailored to this FASCSA requirement, ensuring a baseline level of consistency and alignment between agency-level C-SCRM risk assessment and response functions and those occurring at the government-wide level by authorized bodies such as the FASC.

**Scope**

**In Scope:**
- This appendix primarily focuses on providing additional guidance concerning Section 1326(a)(1) of the FASCSA, which requires executive agencies to assess the supply chain risk posed by the acquisition and use of covered articles and to respond to that risk appropriately. Agencies are directed to perform these activities consistent with NIST standards, guidelines, and practices.

**Out of Scope:**
- Section 4713 of the FASCSA, which pertains to executive agencies’ authority to carry out covered procurement actions, is outside the scope of this appendix. For specific guidance on these actions, refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council regulations. NIST works closely with the FASC and the federal acquisition community to ensure harmonized guidance.

This appendix does not provide detailed instructions on conducting assessments, which are best addressed through role-based training, education, and work experience. NIST SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, is a recommended reference. Agencies should ensure that personnel responsible for performing SCRAs have adequate skills, knowledge, and experience to identify and discern cybersecurity risks in the supply chain. Training in counter-intelligence and security is strongly recommended for C-SCRM PMO staff.

**Relationship to NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1**

The main body and appendices of NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1, discuss the practices and processes for assessing, responding to, and managing cybersecurity risks in the supply chain. This appendix provides supplemental, expanded guidance tailored to federal agencies, describing the scope and type of SCRA information and documentation used to support and advise risk response decisions. This guidance ensures a baseline consistency and sufficiency of processes and SCRI utilized for assessment and documentation, facilitating information sharing and recommendations to decision-makers at both the agency and government-wide levels.

**FASCSA Supply Chain Risk Definition vs. NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1, Cybersecurity-Supply Chain Risk Definition**

Agencies should note that the FASCSA definition of supply chain risk is narrowly focused on risks arising from adversarial threat actors. In contrast, NIST’s definition includes both adversarial and non-adversarial-related risks. Consistent with the FASCSA, agencies must ensure their assessment and risk response activities address all applicable cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.

### Supply Chain Risk Assessments (SCRAs)

**General Information**

The FASCSA requires agencies to conduct and prioritize supply chain risk assessments when acquiring and using covered articles. These assessments are highly dependent on the operating environment and use case. While agencies have flexibility in applying NIST guidelines, there is a need for a baseline level of due diligence and standardization to facilitate government-wide evaluations.

Information used for an assessment typically includes:
1. Purpose and context information (use-case specific).
2. Data or information obtained from the source.
3. All-source information from publicly available, government, and commercial fee-based sources.

The FASCSA recognizes resource constraints but emphasizes the necessity of prioritizing SCRAs. Agencies should establish a tiered set of priority levels based on criticality and potential risk impact, guiding the timing, order, scope, and frequency of assessments.

**Baseline Risk Factors (Common, Minimal)**

This section describes the baseline supply chain risk factors and guidance that agencies should incorporate into their SCRA methodology. These factors help ensure consistent due diligence and inform risk response decisions and actions at various levels within an agency or at the federal enterprise level.

**Objectives for Establishing Baseline Factors:**
- Level setting evaluations for sources and covered articles.
- Ensuring minimum necessary information for the FASC.
- Promoting consistency and comparability across agencies.
- Aiding sophisticated analyses, such as trend analysis.
- Establishing a base of information for identifying and understanding potential mitigation options and informing risk response trade-offs.

**Table E-1: Baseline Risk Factors**

| **Baseline Risk Factor** | **Definition or Guidance** | **Non-exclusive Indicators of Risk (as applicable)** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Use-Case/Context (Inherent Risk)** | Understand the requirement for the product or service and its usage. | - Options available in the marketplace<br> - Urgency of need<br> - Duration of need |
| **Criticality** | Identify if the product, service, or source is deemed critical. Refer to NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1, and Appendix F for EO-critical software. | - Supplier or covered article essential to mission-critical functions, life safety, homeland security, critical infrastructure, or national security interest. |
| **Information and Data** | Understand and document the type, amount, purpose, and flow of federal data/information. | - Requirement or ability to access CUI or classified information<br> - Federal information managed and/or accessible to external entities<br> - Product or service data inputs or outputs affecting life safety if compromised. |
| **Reliance on the Covered Article or Source** | Understand and articulate the degree of reliance on a covered article and/or source. | - Prevalence of use by the agency<br> - Single source of supply<br> - Product or service availability in the marketplace<br> - Availability of acceptable alternatives. |
| **User/Operational Environment** | For products included in systems, the user environment should be described in the System Security Plan and/or C-SCRM System Plan. For labor-based services, understand and document relevant information about the user environment. | - Risks and selected security controls documented in the System Security Plan and/or C-SCRM System Plan<br> - Relevant environment considerations documented in procurement plans. |
| **External Agency Interdependencies** | Understand and identify interdependencies related to data, systems, and mission functions. | - Covered article performs a function in support of a government-wide shared service<br> - Exchanges data with another agency’s mission-critical system<br> - Contractor maintains an analytic tool. |
