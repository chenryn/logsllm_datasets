User: I am uploading google app engine application with the help of appcfg.py command from command prompt in windows. 
But after one login I want to upload another application from the same command prompt but i cannot because this second application has no rights with the current login so i want to logout from this session on command prompt so for that what to do? It is a python application
Is there any command to logout from command prompt?
Assistant: You can run appcfg.py with --no_cookies to tell it not to store authentication cookies, or -e EMAIL to specify an email address that differs from the one in the current cookie.
