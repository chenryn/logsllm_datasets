**ATT&CK ID: T0852**  
**ATT&CK Technique Name: Screen Capture**

Adversaries may attempt to capture screenshots from devices within the control system environment. These screenshots can be taken from workstations, Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs), or other devices that display process, device, reporting, alarm, or related data relevant to the environment. The captured displays may reveal critical information about the Industrial Control System (ICS) processes, layout, control mechanisms, and associated schematics. 

In particular, HMIs often provide a wealth of important industrial process information. By analyzing these screen captures, adversaries can gain insights into the intended operations and interactions between critical devices, thereby enhancing their understanding of the ICS environment.
