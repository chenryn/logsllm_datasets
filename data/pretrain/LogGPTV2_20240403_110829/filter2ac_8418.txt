ATT&CK ID:T0852
ATT&CK Technique Name:Screen Capture
Adversaries may attempt to perform screen capture of devices in the control system environment. Screenshots may be taken of workstations, HMIs, or other devices that display environment-relevant process, device, reporting, alarm, or related data. These device displays may reveal information regarding the ICS process, layout, control, and related schematics. In particular, an HMI can provide a lot of important industrial process information.  Analysis of screen captures may provide the adversary with an understanding of intended operations and interactions between critical devices.
