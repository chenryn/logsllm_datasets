### Issue Description

When a `MaskedArray` contains a record array, the string representation fails with a `ValueError`. This occurs because the mask does not include the field name mapping that is present in the data. It appears that the field names are not being correctly propagated to the mask.

### Steps to Reproduce

```python
$ python
Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Sep 15 2010, 16:22:56) 
[GCC 4.4.5] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import numpy as np
>>> Z = np.empty((5,), dtype=[('A', np.float32), ('B', np.uint32)])
>>> M = np.ma.masked_where(np.array([True, False, True, False, True]), Z)
>>> print(M)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/storage4/home/gerrit/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/ma/core.py", line 3558, in __str__
    _recursive_printoption(res, m, f)
  File "/storage4/home/gerrit/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/ma/core.py", line 2292, in _recursive_printoption
    (curdata, curmask) = (result[name], mask[name])
ValueError: field named A not found.
>>> print(np.__version__)
2.0.0.dev-12d0200
```

### Summary

The issue arises when attempting to print a `MaskedArray` that contains a record array. The mask does not have the same field name mapping as the data, leading to a `ValueError` during the string representation process. This needs to be addressed to ensure proper handling of record arrays within `MaskedArray`.

### Additional Information

- **Numpy Version:** 2.0.0.dev-12d0200
- **Python Version:** 2.6.6
- **Operating System:** Linux
