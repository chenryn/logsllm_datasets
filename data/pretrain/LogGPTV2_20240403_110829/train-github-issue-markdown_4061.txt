Phenomena:
In version 4.0.0-RC1, when one field in the data I inserted was null, the
automatically generated primary key ID was assigned to other fields. For
example, I want to insert INSERT INTO user (name, remark, age) VALUES ("test",
"null, 18"), after sharding, it becomes INSERT INTO user (name, remark, age,
id) VALUES ("test", "18", "automatically generated primary key id", null)
Analysis:
The **getCurrentIndex** method in the **InsertOptimizeResultUnit** class has
problems, and judgment is problematic when obtaining the current index
subscript. There is no need to recalculate the current table below. The
current scale is known by the number of fields in front of it.
