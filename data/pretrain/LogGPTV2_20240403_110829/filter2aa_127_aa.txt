You've sucked Gotham's brain 
waves and now you've devised a 
way to read minds!
You betcha! Soon my little "Box" will be 
on countless TVs around the world. 
Feeding me, credit card numbers, bank 
codes, sexual fantasies, and little white lies.

Definitions Before We Get Started
• Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs): can record brain activity 
while an individual is performing different actions (for example, 
blinking their eyes, playing a video game, or texting on a 
phone). BCIs are often used to give a user control of a 
computer using their brain activity.

• Targeted elicitation: showing specific stimuli in order to 
obtain a particular response

How Do You Get The 
Information Out?
What kinds of information can be determined from 
elicited neural information?
21
Neural Signal of Interest: 
Electroencephalography (EEG)
• Electrical signals in the brain can 
be recorded 
• Invasive
• Surgically placed electrodes on scalp 
or in brain tissue
• For medical purposes only
• Non-invasive EEG
• Great temporal accuracy (know 
when a signal happens), ideal for 
recording Event Related Potentials
• Extensive relevant literature

35
Experiment: Number Elicitation
• 10 subjects total (8 male, 2 female, average age 31.3 
minus one subject who did not provide age)
• Analyzed 7 subjects
• 10 total rounds per subject, with subject-determined 
breaks in between each round
• At the beginning of each round, the subject selects a 
number, then looks at 200 pseudorandom digit stimuli 
(20 x 10 digits)
• 5 of 7 analyzed subjects did counterbalanced attention 
sessions (pressing the space bar)
36
Trial Timeline
37
Three Different Kinds of Results
• Overall effectiveness in identifying subject’s chosen digit
• Effect of attention on correctly identifying subject’s digit
• Determining current versus future digits (intention)
38
1. Overall effectiveness in identifying subject’s 
chosen digit
For all but one subject, the 
computer correctly calculated 
the correct digit 2-3 times for 
the 10 experimental sessions.

2. Effect of attention on correctly identifying 
subject’s digit
• For space-bar rounds (attention), the target digit was calculated 
8/25 times
• For non-spacebar rounds (passive), the target digit was 
calculated 6/45 times
41
3. Determining current versus future 
digits (intention)
• The number the subject was going to 
pick *for the next round* was calculated 
almost as many times as the number for 
the current round (13 vs 14)
• The number of correct future guesses 
varied by subject (not consistent)
• The odds ratio of calculating the next 
digit compared to the current digit is 1.04

This is scary to researchers, but do 
people *really* care about having 
their brain signals elicited?...
What do consumers think of neural privacy?
44
What Is Being Protected?
• What I’m interested in: quantifiable information that is determined from 
a combination of EEG and relevant environmental stimuli
• Raw, original neural signals without context are much less informative

Issues to Consider in Defining Neural Privacy

Defining Neural Privacy
• We all should have an interest in protecting our neural privacy, but 
require additional legal frameworks to make it a right
51
Defining Neural Privacy
• We all should have an interest in protecting our neural privacy, but 
require additional legal frameworks to make it a right
• Defining and ascribing ownership is necessary to provide value to what is 
being elicited (controlling a video game vs monitoring emotions)

• Defining and ascribing ownership is necessary to provide value to what is 
being elicited (controlling a video game vs monitoring emotions)
• Users should be able to trust that the information taken from elicited 
neural signals by a company will be used and interpreted properly, 
making the relationship between user and company an intimate one

Neuroethics Survey
• Distributed online
• Responses taken for 24 days
• 77 respondents
• 46 Female, 27 Male, 3 other

• 18 indicated mobility impairment

Who/What is Taking Your Information
•
Person procurement of neural planning information is a 
statistically significant privacy violation over the app
•
Mobility status does not statistically impact perceptions of 
neural privacy in these scenarios

Neural and bodily information are similar
What are potential policy and 
regulatory implications?
Is there anything we can do about this?
67
Are there any legal precedents?
• 2008 Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act 
“… establishing a national and uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect 
the public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for 
discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing, 
technologies, research, and new therapies”

• Life Insurance
• John Hancock only offering “interactive” life insurance starting in 2019
• Insurance companies in New York can monitor social media to set premiums

What is the Legal Harm of Elicited Information? 
• Few states have laws specifically limiting collection and use of 
biometric information 
• Texas (Business and Commerce Code, Title 11.A Ch 503) 
• Washington (Chapter 19.375 RCW) 
• Illinois (740 ILCS 14/)

provide fingerprint to complete purchase at park
• Six Flags was in violation of IL law requiring consent and retention policies
• State Supreme Court ruled that failure to follow statute was a harm
