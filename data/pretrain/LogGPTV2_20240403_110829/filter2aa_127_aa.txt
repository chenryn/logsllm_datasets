### Motivating the Research

#### Data in the 21st Century
- **Targeted Advertising and Consumer Profiles:**
  - These are beneficial for commercialism but require vast amounts of data.
- **Corporate Data Collection:**
  - Companies are continually seeking new ways to gather consumer data, including untapped sources.
- **Biometrics:**
  - With the rise of wearables and smartphones, collecting biometric data has become increasingly feasible.
- **Brain-Based Data:**
  - Another potential source of biometric information is the brain.

- **IMDb Quotes:**
  - "You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and now you've devised a way to read minds!"
  - "Soon my little 'Box' will be on countless TVs around the world. Feeding me, credit card numbers, bank codes, sexual fantasies, and little white lies."

### Definitions

- **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs):**
  - BCIs can record brain activity during various actions (e.g., blinking, playing video games, texting). They are often used to control computers using brain signals.
- **Targeted Elicitation:**
  - This involves presenting specific stimuli to elicit a particular response.

---

### Extracting Information from Neural Signals

- **Electroencephalography (EEG):**
  - **Invasive EEG:**
    - Involves surgically placed electrodes on the scalp or within brain tissue, primarily for medical purposes.
  - **Non-Invasive EEG:**
    - Offers excellent temporal accuracy, ideal for recording Event-Related Potentials (ERPs).

- **Guilty Knowledge Test: P300 “Oddball” Response:**
  - A well-documented method for detecting recognition of specific stimuli.

---

### Key Findings from the Literature

- **Proof of Concept:**
  - Side-channel attacks using overt stimuli (Martinovic et al., 2012).
- **Subliminal Stimuli:**
  - Eliciting information using subliminal stimuli (Frank et al., 2013).
- **Brand Preference:**
  - Identifying brand preferences in a video game (Bonaci, 2015).
- **PIN Number Elicitation:**
  - Successfully eliciting PIN numbers (Lange et al., 2016).

---

### Experiment: Number Elicitation

- **Participants:**
  - 10 subjects (8 male, 2 female, average age 31.3, excluding one subject who did not provide age).
- **Procedure:**
  - 10 rounds per subject with breaks in between.
  - Subjects select a number and view 200 pseudorandom digit stimuli.
  - 5 out of 7 analyzed subjects performed attention tasks (pressing the space bar).

- **Results:**
  - **Overall Effectiveness:**
    - For most subjects, the computer correctly identified the chosen digit 2-3 times out of 10 sessions.
  - **Attention Impact:**
    - During attention tasks, the target digit was correctly calculated 8/25 times.
    - During passive sessions, it was 6/45 times.
  - **Future Digits:**
    - The system could predict the next round's digit almost as accurately as the current one (13 vs. 14 correct predictions).

### Consumer Attitudes Towards Neural Privacy

- **What Is Being Protected?**
  - Quantifiable information derived from EEG and environmental stimuli.
  - Raw neural signals without context are less informative.

- **Defining Neural Privacy:**
  - **Privacy as a Right or Interest:**
    - We should have an interest in protecting neural privacy, requiring additional legal frameworks.
  - **Ownership of Thoughts:**
    - Defining ownership is crucial for valuing elicited information (e.g., controlling a video game vs. monitoring emotions).
  - **Trust:**
    - Users should trust that companies will use and interpret their neural data properly.

- **Survey Results:**
  - **Demographics:**
    - 77 respondents (46 female, 27 male, 3 other, 1 no response).
    - Average age 39.7, median 35.5.
    - 18 indicated mobility impairment.
  - **Perceptions:**
    - Personal procurement of neural planning information is seen as a significant privacy violation.
    - Mobility status does not significantly impact perceptions of neural privacy.

- **Trust and Willingness:**
  - Size and bureaucracy decrease willingness and trust to share neural information.
  - Comparisons with other types of personal data (e.g., Fitbit, medical records, genetic information).

### Policy and Regulatory Implications

- **Legal Precedents:**
  - **Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (2008):**
    - Establishes national standards to protect against discrimination and promote genetic testing.
  - **Life Insurance:**
    - John Hancock offers interactive life insurance starting in 2019.
    - New York allows insurance companies to monitor social media to set premiums.

- **State Laws:**
  - Few states have laws limiting the collection and use of biometric information.
  - Examples include Texas, Washington, and Illinois.

- **Case Study: Rosenbach v. Six Flags:**
  - A mother purchased a season pass for her son, unaware he would need to provide a fingerprint.
  - Six Flags violated Illinois law, which requires consent and retention policies.
  - The state Supreme Court ruled that failure to follow the statute was a harm.

### Final Questions

- **Who Should Be Involved in Regulating BCIs?**
  - User
  - University Researchers
  - Independent Regulatory Organizations
  - Legislators
  - Device Manufacturers
