adversary guesses as liked by the target, and let P be the set
of items actually liked by the target. We then deﬁne set score
as follows, with (cid:6) as the symmetric difference of two sets.
setScore(G, P ) =
|G(cid:6)P| − |G ∩ P|
|G ∪ P|
A set score of 1 (adversary’s failure) indicates that all the
guessed items are wrong (highest privacy), while a set score
of −1 (adversary’s success) indicates the adversary guessed
exactly the target’s liked items (no privacy).
Finally, we evaluate overhead by comparing the bandwidth
consumption and the storage space required by a H&S-based
recommendation system with those required by a standard
implementation like that of the reference model described in
Section II.
4) Default parameters: The subsequent results correspond
to simulations using neighborhood and RPS view sizes of 10
peers. Compact proﬁle sizes depend on the dataset used: 660
and 1473 bits for ML-100k and ML-1M respectively (roughly
40% of the number of items), and 99 bits for Jester. When
the number of landmarks is not explicitly mentioned, H&S
uses 50 landmarks. This represents a good trade-off between
recommendation quality and privacy. For all the metrics except
set score, we plot values averaged over all the peers.
B. Recommendation quality
an H&S-based system using precision and recall [9].
We evaluate the quality of recommendations providing by
(cid:2)recommendedItems ∩ likedItems(cid:2)
precision(user) =
(cid:2)recommendedItems(cid:2)
(cid:2)recommendedItems ∩ likedItems(cid:2)
(cid:2)likedItems(cid:2)
recall(user) =
We consider an item as liked when its rating is greater
than or equal to a dataset-dependent threshold (rating ≥ 3
for MovieLens and rating ≥ 0.0 for Jester). Using user-
dependent threshold values such as the average rating, the
median rating, or the half of the rating range for each peer
results in similar or lower precision/recall values. This suggests
that users tend to use the available rating range similarly.

Peers recommend the r most liked item in their neighbor-
hoods, not including those they have already rated. We check
whether a recommended item is liked by looking at the rating
given to this item by the recipient in the test set.
Figures 5 and 6 show precision and recall values for
several values of r. The former shows the results with the
MovieLens datasets, and the latter shows the results with the
Jester dataset. For each dataset, we compare the results of
the H&S-based system (triangle-shaped) with a lower bound
(square-shaped) and a cleartext baseline (circle-shaped). The
lower bound consists of a CF system that uses completely
random neighbors. The baseline consists of the reference
model with full proﬁles in cleartext, as described in Section II.
The absolute values of recall and precision are quite high
even with random neighborhoods because we do not consider
items for which a user has no rating in the original dataset as
potential recommendations. More generally, absolute values of
precision and recall depend on the predictability and regularity
of the dataset, and their acceptable levels depend on the
application.
Figure 5 shows consistent results by the H&S-based system
across the two MovieLens datasets. H&S provides a reasonable
quality of recommendations: it never suffers from a degrada-
tion of more than 50% with respect to the cleartext baseline.
Moreover the higher the value of r, the closer the quality
remains to that of the cleartext baseline.
Figure 6 shows a similar behavior of the H&S-based system
with the Jester datastet. Recall reaches almost a value of 1
because the dataset only contains 100 items. This characteristic
is also the cause of the maximum precision values being lower
than those of the MovieLens datasets. As the test set does not
contain many items, we consider that a recommended item
without rating in this set is disliked by the recipient, instead
of ignoring it as done otherwise. Although this approach
is pessimistic, it allows us to make a sufﬁcient number of
recommendations.
We showed that H&S preserves the quality of recommen-
dation, being only slightly worse than the cleartext baseline. In
the following, we show that it achieves this while protecting
the privacy of users.

quality. The H&S similarity is the main source of perturbation of neighborhood
quality.

based system and a system with perturbation-based privacy.
C. Neighborhood quality
In order to evaluate the extent to which neighborhoods
are different from the optimal neighborhoods, we use the
neighborhood quality measure as deﬁned in Section IV-A3.
Figure 7 shows the evolution of neighborhood quality with
the size of neighborhoods. For each dataset, it compares the
H&S-based system (triangle-shaped) with a CF system using
random neighbors as a lower bound (square-shaped) and a
variant of our system model using compact proﬁles (star-
shaped). Our reference model from Section II by deﬁnition
achieves a neighborhood quality of 1 and compact proﬁles
provide neighborhoods that are almost identical in the ML
datasets. In the case of Jester, they lower neighborhood quality
by 50% because the Jester dataset contains only a few items.
This makes it more sensitive to the collisions in the Bloom
ﬁlters.
H&S similarity has a more signiﬁcant impact on neighbor-
hood quality than compact proﬁles. Yet, H&S’s neighborhood
still retain their utility in terms of recommendation as we
showed in Section IV-B. Because landmarks are randomly
generated, some of them might be “far” from the two users
comparing themselves,
thus giving little information about
the users’ similarity. Moreover, a set of landmarks is not
necessarily linearly independent. The lower quality of H&S-
generated neighborhoods is in fact an asset in terms of privacy.
Because of this mix of neighbors with various levels of
similarity, the adversary cannot infer her target’s interests just
by looking at her target’s neighbors.
D. Privacy
We evaluate the privacy offered by H&S by running a
proﬁle reconstruction attack against it. This attack consists in
trying to discover the liked items in a targeted peer’s proﬁle
using information obtained during similarity computation. We
quantify the resilience of H&S to such attacks with the set
score deﬁned in Section IV-A3.
The adversary makes her guess in two steps: (1) she tries to
infer her target’s compact proﬁle, then (2) she tries to deduce
the items forming this proﬁle. We consider for (1) that the
adversary uses the closest landmark to her target as her guessed
proﬁle. For (2), we consider that the adversary knows all the
items in the system, so she includes in her guessed set all the
items matching the guessed proﬁle.
We compare our H&S-based system with a perturbation-
based privacy technique. When using this technique, peers
compute their similarity by the usual proﬁle exchange, but
they add random noise to their proﬁle to protect their privacy.
For the sake of comparison, peers implement this technique by
using compact proﬁles and randomizing a certain percentage
of bits in the proﬁle.
Figure 8 compares our H&S-based system and a recom-
mendation system using randomized compact proﬁles, in terms
of the trade-off between recommendation quality and privacy.
We use set score for the latter and F1 score, the harmonic mean
of precision and recall, for the former. We obtain different
values of this trade-off by varying the number of landmarks
from 2 to 100 for the H&S system, and by varying the number
of randomized bits in proﬁles from 5% to 100% for the
perturbation-based system. Set score values are averages over
100 different adversaries and 200 different targets, i.e. 20,000
different sets of landmarks. F1 score values correspond to
r = 30 recommendations.
We observe that the H&S-based system provides an ex-
cellent level of privacy in any case. It also provides a rec-
ommendation quality on par with the best values of the other
system, starting from 25 landmarks. However, the increase in
recommendation quality does not grow as fast as increase in
the number of landmarks.
The recommendation system using randomized compact
proﬁles preserves an almost optimal recommendation quality
with up to 75% of randomized bits. Although it achieves rea-
sonable privacy (setScore = 0.8 approximately) starting from
50% of randomized bits, it never reaches the privacy levels
offered by the H&S-based system. Even 100% of randomized
bits does not yield a set score of 1 because the attacker tries
to match all item signatures against the randomized proﬁle. In
general, a fully randomized compact proﬁle will contain more
bits with value 1 than a landmark. This will cause the attacker
to identify more potentially matching items.
With these basic strategies for the proﬁle reconstruction
attack, we showed that H&S provides improved privacy to
users without sacriﬁcing recommendation quality, and without
obvious ﬂaws.

Fig. 9. Average bandwidth consumption of a peer per gossip cycle. The
H&S-based system consumes roughly twice to seven times more bandwidth
than our system model with 5 to 50 landmarks.
Fig. 10. Average storage space needed for a peer. The H&S-based system
needs less storage space because peers only store the seed used to generate
landmarks.
E. Overhead
We evaluate the overhead caused by H&S to peers in terms
of bandwidth consumption and storage space.
Overall, H&S incurs the most part of its overhead when two
peers compute their similarity for the ﬁrst time because they
have to generate a seed using the bit commitment scheme and
store this seed. So we measure in our simulations the average
number of similarity computations with new peers. The other
parameters inﬂuencing H&S’s overhead are the sizes of the
RPS and neighborhood views, and the number of landmarks.
The main factors impacting bandwidth consumption are
the exchange of coordinate vectors and the bit commitment
scheme. The main factor impacting storage space is the need
to store seeds.
Figure 9 compares the H&S-based system (triangle-shaped)
and the reference model (circle-shaped) in terms of the average
bandwidth consumption of a peer per gossip cycle. Bandwidth
consumption of the H&S-based system increases linearly with
the number of landmarks used. It consumes roughly twice to
seven times more bandwidth than the reference model, but the
absolute values remain reasonable (up to 700KiB per cycle).
Moreover, it can probably be improved as a bit commitment
protocol with O(1) bits of communication per committed bit
exists [20].
Figure 10 compares the H&S-based system and the refer-
ence model in terms of the average storage space needed by a
peer. The H&S-based system needs less storage space because
peers only store the seed used to generate landmarks instead
of storing the proﬁles of peers in their neighborhood and RPS
views as done by standard systems. Still, we observe that the
required storage space is tiny compared to the storage capacity
of modern devices (computers, smartphones, tablets, etc).
