Go Version: go version go1.4 windows/amd64
I was editing a file with Windows line endings, and I was unable to make it
work.
It seems like the \r character is added as part of the last parameter, which
makes commands fail.
It should be re-producible with all files using \r\n as line endings, but here
is the actual command I used.
    //go:generate ffjson $GOFILE
Using quoting also makes it fail.
    //go:generate ffjson "file.go"
Will exit with "expect space after quoted argument", because the next
character check in the following code fails:
                        // Check the next character is space or end of line.
                        if len(line) > 0 && line[0] != ' ' && line[0] != '\t' {
                            g.errorf("expect space after quoted argument")
                        }
line[0] is '\r'
