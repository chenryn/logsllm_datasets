Hello,

I noticed that the following line appears to be duplicated, one right after the other, in both the minified and full 3.02 versions:

```css
.container:before, .container:after { display: table; content: "" }
.container:after { clear: both }
```

This duplication should be removed to ensure the CSS is clean and efficient.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
