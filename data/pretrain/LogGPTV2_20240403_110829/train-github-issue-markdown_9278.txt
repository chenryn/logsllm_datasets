### Issue: Unable to Style the Expandable Icon Button

**Version:** 0.18.1 (installed via npm)

**Summary:**
I have searched through the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

**Code:**

```jsx
class TaskCard extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    const { data } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        <ExpandableIcon
          icon="play_arrow"
          errorIcon="error"
          style={{ display: 'inline-block', width: '80%' }}
          iconStyle={{ margin: '0px' }}
        />
        {/* Buttons */}
        {data.FixDetails}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Rendering through map
data.Tasks.map((x, i) => <TaskCard key={i} data={x} />);
```

**Error:**
```

```

**Explanation:**
The warning indicates that the `iconStyle` prop is not recognized by the `<div>` element. This suggests that the component you are using does not support the `iconStyle` prop. You may need to check the documentation for the `ExpandableIcon` component or use a different approach to apply the styles.
