User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does embedding (concatenating) a user ID in a session token for logging have any security implications? Assuming there's a user with ID 123456 logging into a web application where the randomly generated session identifier to be stored in the cookie looks like this 123456zXRL9DWpPtaAhkPzhemQZE5P5F (that is, prefixed with the user ID ******zXRL9DWpPtaAhkPzhemQZE5P5F), what are the potential security implications?

This would be to generate user identifiable access logs throughout various hops in a system, web servers, proxies etc. without the need to come up with schemes to pass around the user IDs.

Thanks

Assistant: It can have potentially serious implications. If the user authentication process use that User ID, an attacker can do a DOS attack sending wrong authentications data and locking User ID account.

If the User ID is not directly consistent to user personal informations (e.g. anonymization)  it is not considered personal data.
