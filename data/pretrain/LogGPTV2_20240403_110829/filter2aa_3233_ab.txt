compute resources and applications/services) to only those subjects and assets identified as 
needing access as well as continually authenticating and authorizing the identity and security 
posture of each access request. 
A zero trust architecture (ZTA) is an enterprise cybersecurity architecture that is based on zero 
trust principles and designed to prevent data breaches and limit internal lateral movement. This 
publication discusses ZTA, its logical components, possible deployment scenarios, and threats. It 
also presents a general road map for organizations wishing to migrate to a zero trust design 
approach and discusses relevant federal policies that may impact or influence a zero trust 
architecture.  
ZT is not a single architecture but a set of guiding principles for workflow, system design and 
operations that can be used to improve the security posture of any classification or sensitivity 
level [FIPS199]. Transitioning to ZTA is a journey concerning how an organization evaluates 
risk in its mission and cannot simply be accomplished with a wholesale replacement of 
technology. That said, many organizations already have elements of a ZTA in their enterprise 
infrastructure today. Organizations should seek to incrementally implement zero trust principles, 
process changes, and technology solutions that protect their data assets and business functions by 
use case. Most enterprise infrastructures will operate in a hybrid zero trust/perimeter-based mode 
while continuing to invest in IT modernization initiatives and improve organization business 
processes.   
Organizations need to implement comprehensive information security and resiliency practices 
for zero trust to be effective. When balanced with existing cybersecurity policies and guidance, 
identity and access management, continuous monitoring, and best practices, a ZTA can protect

1.1 
History of Zero Trust Efforts Related to Federal Agencies 
The concept of zero trust has been present in cybersecurity since before the term “zero trust” was 
coined. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and the Department of Defense 
published their work on a more secure enterprise strategy dubbed “black core” [BCORE]. Black 
core involved moving from a perimeter-based security model to one that focused on the security 
of individual transactions. The work of the Jericho Forum in 2004 publicized the idea of de-
perimeterization—limiting implicit trust based on network location and the limitations of relying 
on single, static defenses over a large network segment [JERICHO]. The concepts of de-
perimeterization evolved and improved into the larger concept of zero trust, which was later 
coined by John Kindervag1 while at Forrester.2 Zero trust then became the term used to describe 
various cybersecurity solutions that moved security away from implied trust based on network 
location and instead focused on evaluating trust on a per-transaction basis. Both private industry 
and higher education have also undergone this evolution from perimeter-based security to a 
security strategy based on zero trust principles. 
Federal agencies have been urged to move to security based on zero trust principles for more 
than a decade, building capabilities and policies such as the Federal Information Security 
Modernization Act (FISMA) followed by the Risk Management Framework (RMF); Federal 
Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM); Trusted Internet Connections (TIC); 
and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) programs. All of these programs aim to 
restrict data and resource access to authorized parties. When these programs were started, they 
were limited by the technical capabilities of information systems. Security policies were largely 
static and were enforced at large “choke points” that an enterprise could control to get the largest 
effect for the effort. As technology matures, it is becoming possible to continually analyze and 
evaluate access requests in a dynamic and granular fashion to a “need to access” basis to mitigate 
data exposure due to compromised accounts, attackers monitoring a network, and other threats.

Zero Trust Basics 
Zero trust is a cybersecurity paradigm focused on resource protection and the premise that trust 
is never granted implicitly but must be continually evaluated. Zero trust architecture is an end-to-
end approach to enterprise resource and data security that encompasses identity (person and non-
person entities), credentials, access management, operations, endpoints, hosting environments, 
and the interconnecting infrastructure. The initial focus should be on restricting resources to 
those with a need to access and grant only the minimum privileges (e.g., read, write, delete) 
needed to perform the mission. Traditionally, agencies (and enterprise networks in general) have 
focused on perimeter defense and authenticated subjects are given authorized access to a broad 
collection of resources once on the internal network. As a result, unauthorized lateral movement 
within the environment has been one of the biggest challenges for federal agencies.  
The Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) and agency perimeter firewalls provide strong internet 
gateways. This helps block attackers from the internet, but the TICs and perimeter firewalls are 
less useful for detecting and blocking attacks from inside the network and cannot protect subjects 
outside of the enterprise perimeter (e.g., remote workers, cloud-based services, edge devices, 
etc.).  
An operative definition of zero trust and zero trust architecture is as follows: 
Zero trust (ZT) provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize 
uncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per-request access decisions in 
information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. Zero 
trust architecture (ZTA) is an enterprise’s cybersecurity plan that utilizes zero trust 
concepts and encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access 
policies. Therefore, a zero trust enterprise is the network infrastructure (physical and 
virtual) and operational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a zero 
trust architecture plan. 
An enterprise decides to adopt zero trust as its core strategy and generate a zero trust architecture 
as a plan developed with zero trust principles (see Section 2.1 below) in mind. This plan is then 
deployed to produce a zero trust environment for use in the enterprise.   
This definition focuses on the crux of the issue, which is the goal to prevent unauthorized access 
to data and services coupled with making the access control enforcement as granular as 
possible. That is, authorized and approved subjects (combination of user, application (or service), 
and device) can access the data to the exclusion of all other subjects (i.e., attackers). To take this 
one step further, the word “resource” can be substituted for “data” so that ZT and ZTA are about 
resource access (e.g., printers, compute resources, Internet of Things [IoT] actuators) and not just 
data access.  
To lessen uncertainties (as they cannot be eliminated), the focus is on authentication, 
authorization, and shrinking implicit trust zones while maintaining availability and minimizing 
temporal delays in authentication mechanisms. Access rules are made as granular as possible to 
enforce least privileges needed to perform the action in the request.

In the abstract model of access shown in Figure 1, a subject needs access to an enterprise 
resource. Access is granted through a policy decision point (PDP) and corresponding policy 
enforcement point (PEP).3  
Figure 1: Zero Trust Access 
The system must ensure that the subject is authentic and the request is valid. The PDP/PEP 
passes proper judgment to allow the subject to access the resource. This implies that zero trust 
applies to two basic areas: authentication and authorization. What is the level of confidence 
about the subject’s identity for this unique request? Is access to the resource allowable given the 
level of confidence in the subject’s identity? Does the device used for the request have the proper 
security posture? Are there other factors that should be considered and that change the 
confidence level (e.g., time, location of subject, subject’s security posture)? Overall, enterprises 
need to develop and maintain dynamic risk-based policies for resource access and set up a 
system to ensure that these policies are enforced correctly and consistently for individual 
resource access requests. This means that an enterprise should not rely on implied 
trustworthiness wherein if the subject has met a base authentication level (e.g., logging into an 
asset), all subsequent resource requests are assumed to be equally valid.  
The “implicit trust zone” represents an area where all the entities are trusted to at least the level 
of the last PDP/PEP gateway. For example, consider the passenger screening model in an airport. 
All passengers pass through the airport security checkpoint (PDP/PEP) to access the boarding 
gates. The passengers, airport employees, aircraft crew, etc., mill about in the terminal area, and 
all the individuals are considered trusted. In this model, the implicit trust zone is the boarding 
area. 
The PDP/PEP applies a set of controls so that all traffic beyond the PEP has a common level of 
trust. The PDP/PEP cannot apply additional policies beyond its location in the flow of traffic. To 
allow the PDP/PEP to be as specific as possible, the implicit trust zone must be as small as 
possible.  
Zero trust provides a set of principles and concepts around moving the PDP/PEPs closer to the 
resource. The idea is to explicitly authenticate and authorize all subjects, assets and workflows 
that make up the enterprise.

2.1 
Tenets of Zero Trust  
Many definitions and discussions of ZT stress the concept of removing wide-area perimeter 
defenses (e.g., enterprise firewalls) as a factor. However, most of these definitions continue to 
define themselves in relation to perimeters in some way (such as micro-segmentation or micro-
perimeters; see Section 3.1) as part of the functional capabilities of a ZTA. The following is an 
attempt to define ZT and ZTA in terms of basic tenets that should be involved rather than what is 
excluded. These tenets are the ideal goal, though it must be acknowledged that not all tenets may 
be fully implemented in their purest form for a given strategy. 
A zero trust architecture is designed and deployed with adherence to the following zero trust 
basic tenets: 
1. All data sources and computing services are considered resources. A network may be 
composed of multiple classes of devices. A network may also have small footprint 
devices that send data to aggregators/storage, software as a service (SaaS), systems 
sending instructions to actuators, and other functions. Also, an enterprise may decide to 
classify personally owned devices as resources if they can access enterprise-owned 
resources. 
2. All communication is secured regardless of network location. Network location alone 
does not imply trust. Access requests from assets located on enterprise-owned network 
infrastructure (e.g., inside a legacy network perimeter) must meet the same security 
requirements as access requests and communication from any other nonenterprise-owned 
network. In other words, trust should not be automatically granted based on the device 
being on enterprise network infrastructure. All communication should be done in the 
most secure manner available, protect confidentiality and integrity, and provide source 
authentication. 
3. Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis. Trust in 
the requester is evaluated before the access is granted. Access should also be granted with 
the least privileges needed to complete the task. This could mean only “sometime 
recently” for this particular transaction and may not occur directly before initiating a 
session or performing a transaction with a resource. However, authentication and 
authorization to one resource will not automatically grant access to a different resource. 
4. Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy—including the observable state 
of client identity, application/service, and the requesting asset—and may include 
other behavioral and environmental attributes. An organization protects resources by 
defining what resources it has, who its members are (or ability to authenticate users from 
a federated community), and what access to resources those members need. For zero 
trust, client identity can include the user account (or service identity) and any associated 
attributes assigned by the enterprise to that account or artifacts to authenticate automated 
tasks. Requesting asset state can include device characteristics such as software versions 
installed, network location, time/date of request, previously observed behavior, and 
installed credentials. Behavioral attributes include, but not limited to, automated subject 
analytics, device analytics, and measured deviations from observed usage patterns. Policy 
is the set of access rules based on attributes that an organization assigns to a subject, data 
asset, or application. Environmental attributes may include such factors as requestor

network location, time, reported active attacks, etc. These rules and attributes are based 
on the needs of the business process and acceptable level of risk. Resource access and 
action permission policies can vary based on the sensitivity of the resource/data. Least 
privilege principles are applied to restrict both visibility and accessibility. 
5. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all 
owned and associated assets. No asset is inherently trusted. The enterprise evaluates the 
security posture of the asset when evaluating a resource request. An enterprise 
implementing a ZTA should establish a continuous diagnostics and mitigation (CDM) or 
similar system to monitor the state of devices and applications and should apply 
patches/fixes as needed. Assets that are discovered to be subverted, have known 
vulnerabilities, and/or are not managed by the enterprise may be treated differently 
(including denial of all connections to enterprise resources) than devices owned by or 
associated with the enterprise that are deemed to be in their most secure state. This may 
also apply to associated devices (e.g., personally owned devices) that may be allowed to 
access some resources but not others. This, too, requires a robust monitoring and 
reporting system in place to provide actionable data about the current state of enterprise 
resources. 
6. All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced 
before access is allowed. This is a constant cycle of obtaining access, scanning and 
assessing threats, adapting, and continually reevaluating trust in ongoing communication. 
An enterprise implementing a ZTA would be expected to have Identity, Credential, and 
Access Management (ICAM) and asset management systems in place. This includes the 
use of multifactor authentication (MFA) for access to some or all enterprise resources. 
Continual monitoring with possible reauthentication and reauthorization occurs 
throughout user transactions, as defined and enforced by policy (e.g., time-based, new 
resource requested, resource modification, anomalous subject activity detected) that 
strives to achieve a balance of security, availability, usability, and cost-efficiency. 
7. The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of 
assets, network infrastructure and communications and uses it to improve its 
security posture. An enterprise should collect data about asset security posture, network 
traffic and access requests, process that data, and use any insight gained to improve 
policy creation and enforcement. This data can also be used to provide context for access 
requests from subjects (see Section 3.3.1). 
The above tenets attempt to be technology agnostic. For example, “user identification (ID)” 
could include several factors such as username/password, certificates, and onetime password. 
These tenets apply to work done within an organization or in collaboration with one or more 
partner organizations and not to anonymous public or consumer-facing business processes. An 
organization cannot impose internal policies on external actors (e.g., customers or general 
internet users) but may be able to implement some ZT-based policies on nonenterprise users who 
have a special relationship with the organization (e.g. registered customers, employee 
dependents, etc.).

2.2 
A Zero Trust View of a Network  
There are some basic assumptions for network connectivity for any organization that utilizes 
ZTA in network planning and deployment. Some of these assumptions apply to enterprise-owned 
network infrastructure, and some apply to enterprise-owned resources operating on 
nonenterprise-owned network infrastructure (e.g., public Wi-Fi or public cloud providers). These 
assumptions are used to direct the formation of a ZTA. The network in an enterprise 
implementing a ZTA should be developed with the ZTA tenets outlined above and with the 
following assumptions.    
1. The entire enterprise private network is not considered an implicit trust zone. Assets 
should always act as if an attacker is present on the enterprise network, and 
communication should be done in the most secure manner available (see tenet 2 above). 
This entails actions such as authenticating all connections and encrypting all traffic. 
2. Devices on the network may not be owned or configurable by the enterprise. Visitors 
and/or contracted services may include nonenterprise-owned assets that need network 
access to perform their role. This includes bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies that 
allow enterprise subjects to use nonenterprise-owned devices to access enterprise 
resources. 
3. No resource is inherently trusted. Every asset must have its security posture evaluated 
via a PEP before a request is granted to an enterprise-owned resource (similar to tenet 6
