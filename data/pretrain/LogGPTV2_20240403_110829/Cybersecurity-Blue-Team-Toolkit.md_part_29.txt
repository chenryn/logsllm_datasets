you will use in the future for all servers and workstations. I have
worked with small to medium businesses whose idea of provisioning a
laptop for a new user is to order one from New Egg, open the box, hand
the new employee the machine, and let him or her set it up. If you
accept the default options on a Windows machine, how many
vulnerabilities are sitting there out in the open?
Security is about balance. Considering the CIA triad, use caution when
securing a workstation. Some organizations lock down their systems so
hard they make it difficult for end users to do their job. Some
organizations do nothing to preconfigure a system and leave themselves
vulnerable. There are a couple of free tools you can use to compare a
configuration to a predetermined template.
Microsoft has a Security Configuration and Analysis tool that is free.
It is a stand‐alone snap‐in tool that users can add to import one or
more saved configurations. Importing configurations builds a specific
security database that stores a composite configuration. You can apply
this composite configuration to the computer and analyze the current
system configuration against the baseline configuration stored in the
database. These configurations are saved as text‐based `.inf` files.
In [Lab 12.3](#c12.xhtml#c12-fea-0003){#c12.xhtml#R_c12-fea-0003},
you\'ll be adding the Security Configuration and Analysis (SCA) tool to
a Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

you will want to perform an analysis. To do so, right‐click the Security
Configuration And Analysis option, and select the Analyze Computer Now
command from the shortcut menu. When prompted, enter the desired log
file path, and click OK.
[]{#c12.xhtml#Page_177 .pagebreak title="177" role="doc-pagebreak"}You
can compare the template settings against the computer\'s settings. As
you analyze the comparison, pay attention to the icons associated with
the policy setting. A green icon indicates that the setting is defined
within the template, and the PC is compliant with that setting. A gray
icon indicates that the setting is undefined in the template, and a red
icon indicates that the setting is defined within the template, but the
machine is not compliant.
As stated earlier, a security template is a plain‐text file that takes
an `.inf` extension. This means it\'s possible to copy, edit, and
manipulate security templates using nothing more than a text editor. It
is better to work from an existing template file. So, always begin
working on security templates by opening an existing template; then
always use the Save As command to save it under a new name. If you use
the Save command but find you have made a mistake in the configuration,
you have nothing to restore. From experience, it is much easier to save
the original and change the next template to keep working templates
working and leave default templates in a restorable state.

Now that you have the asset configured with all the proper policies and
patched, it is time to prepare it for cloning.

## Clonezilla Live {#c12.xhtml#head-2-94}
Using any of the freely available imaging solutions like Clonezilla is
an efficient way to create a fully configured and patched system image
for distribution on your network. Clonezilla can be implemented from a
server or a bootable []{#c12.xhtml#Page_180 .pagebreak title="180"
role="doc-pagebreak"}device and permits users a variety of options based
on their needs. One of the more flexible options of this solution can be
deployed using a portable drive. This drive can contain prestaged images
for on‐site deployment. Sometimes you will have a situation where a
machine will not boot to the network or it is against regulations to
move an ailing asset and using a portable drive is ideal.
If you have an on‐site technician lab, you can create an effective
cloning system using a server machine, one or more technician machines,
and a network switch to facilitate deployment to multiple systems at
once. Many environments have this equipment sitting unused on a shelf.
In practice, this simple setup has been shown to be able to image and
deploy more than 100 systems in a single week.
Some best practices to consider when deciding to clone systems versus
original media installations include the following:
-   [Use an established checklist for pre‐ and post‐imaging actions to
    ensure proper system deployment.]{#c12.xhtml#c12-li-0034}
-   [Update your technician machine(s) to the most current updates
    according to your security policy.]{#c12.xhtml#c12-li-0035}
-   [Update your images on a manageable schedule. This ensures that
    system images require less post‐deployment
    patching.]{#c12.xhtml#c12-li-0036}
-   [Have important drivers readily available for the variety of systems
    that your image will support.]{#c12.xhtml#c12-li-0037}
-   [Use a sysprep tool to remove system identifiers prior to taking
    your image.]{#c12.xhtml#c12-li-0038}
-   [Use a secure repository to hold your system images; often having a
    stand‐alone cloning system works well.]{#c12.xhtml#c12-li-0039}
-   [Have a method to positively assure the integrity of your stored
    images. Hashing is a cheap but effective method for this
    purpose.]{#c12.xhtml#c12-li-0040}
