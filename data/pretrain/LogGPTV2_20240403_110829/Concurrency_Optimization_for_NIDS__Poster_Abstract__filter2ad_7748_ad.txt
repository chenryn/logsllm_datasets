to biomarkers of lung cancer being strongly associated to smoking This distorts the biological interpretation of metabolites and pathways associated 
with smoking and does not generalize to new population of non-cancer patients The combination of weighting strategies with popular analytical models 
(ie PLS-DA, generalized linear models with regularization, and random forest) has the effect of not only leading to statistically valid models with good 
predictive ability, but also, the extracted biomarkers are independent of the primary outcome In short, the extracted urinary biomarkers were more 
specifically associated with smoking than with lung cancer status Consequently, we developed a framework for introducing weights to guide researchers 
in choosing an appropriate weighting method Finally, we discuss the application of the framework to metabolomics studies using secondary data

Improving Technologies for High Throughput and Miniaturized Metabolomics for Precision Medicine
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Thomas Hankemeier, Leiden University, Netherlands 
Where genomics has proven to be successful to predict disease risk, metabolomics can assess the actual health state and monitor disease development 
and treatment response Large-scale metabolomics studies are necessary for better and more specific prognosis of chronic diseases For this efficient 
and quantitative metabolomics methods are necessary Novel technologies to enable this will be discussed in this lecture We have developed a hanging 
droplet evaporator that allows innovative workflows for high throughput (HT) and miniaturized sample preparation We have developed electrodriven 
sample preparation technologies for metabolomics Next, the use of microfluidic-based advanced in-vitro models with organotypic characteristics will 
be introduced, and how this platform can be used to study disease mechanisms and disease pathways identified using metabolomics This requires 
miniaturized metabolomics methods and technologies Actually, similar innovations for HT metabolomics can be used for miniaturized metabolomics An 
outlook will be given how metabolomics will impact clinical research and ultimately clinical decision support

Investigation of host-microbiota co-metabolism as a new strategy for biomarker discovery –  
New Chemical Biology tools for Metabolomics analysis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Daniel Globisch, Uppsala University, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Mário S.P. Correia, Louis P. Conway, Weifeng Lin, Abhishek Jain, Caroline Ballet, Neeraj Garg
The detailed investigation of metabolites in human samples has been termed metabolomics and carries a great potential for the discovery of unknown 
biomarkers Metabolomics still requires advanced chemical tools compared to other ‘omics areas One of the most exciting scientific developments in 
the past decade has been the understanding that gut microbiota profoundly impact human physiology The complex consortium of trillions of microbes 
possesses a wide range of metabolic activity Only limited information on this interspecies co-metabolism has been elucidated on a molecular level We 
have developed new state-of-the-art Chemical Biology techniques for an enhanced metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography-coupled with 
tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) A unique chemoselective probe immobilized to magnetic beads was prepared for analysis of human fecal 
samples This complex probe allows for facile extraction of metabolites and led to increased mass spectrometric sensitivity by a factor of 2000 In another 
new methods, we utilized selective enzymatic treatment of metabolites in human samples to easily identify converted metabolites and elucidate their 
chemical formula using mass spectrometry We chemically synthesized each identified molecule to unequivocally validate the molecular structure Using 
this specific workflow, we have successfully identified three times as many sulfated metabolites than reported in the Human Metabolome Database Our 
unique metabolite-analyzing methodologies at the interface of Chemistry and Biology are aimed at overcoming limitations in mass spectrometry-based 
metabolomics research We are applying these methods for the discovery of unknown metabolites in medical relevant samples to evaluate their potential 
as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer

GC×GC-TOFMS and SIFT-MS approaches for clinical breath-based asthma phenotyping
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Pierre-Hugues Stefanuto, Liège University, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Delphine Zanella, Joeri Vercammen, Florence Schleich, Renaud Louis, Jean-François Focant
The ballistic rise of analytical technologies has opened a large playground for all type of “omics” screening On one side, separation science based on 
multidimensional methods such as comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) appeared as one of the methods of choice for the 
characterization complex mixtures On the other side, direct introduction instruments such as single ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) offered 
the capacity to perform both targeted and non-targeted analyses within a few minutes At the price of high cost equipment and limited adaptability to 
routine medical usage, GC×GC-HRTOFMS offers the possibility to almost completely characterize a sample composition This is of prime importance 
when systems biology are considered For large scale screening, SIFT-MS can generate compositional patterns from direct sample introduction at 
the same time than other routine medical actions These two orthogonal approaches for pathology screening should ideally conduct to identical 
sample classifications but have never been directly compared over an identical set of patients In this study, breath from 50 asthmatic patients were 
analyzed by both techniques As a reference, asthma phenotypes were established using sputum analysis Breath samples were collected using 
TedlarÒ bags For GC×GC-HRTOFMS analyses, the bags were transferred onto thermal desorption tubes prior to injection For SIFT-MS, the bags were 
directly emptied into the instrument Next, data were analyzed using identical processing workflow We observed that both approaches offered similar 
classification capacities GC×GC-HRTOFMS allowed identifying the putative markers for comparison with previous studies and metabolic interpretation 
while SIFT-MS offered a faster screening-capacity

Mathematical modelling of metabolism: a driver for developing personalized and precision medicine
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Natal van Riel, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands
Metabolic derailments associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes can be studied with mixed meal tests (MTT’s) The plasma metabolome 
enriched with measurements of hormones and cytokines, provide valuable information about the physiological state of an individual An increasingly 
important, but complex task is to extract biomedical parameters with diagnostic value from large and multivariate datasets We applied model-based data 
processing and analysis, combining computer simulation models, stochastic models of uncertainties and machine learning of time-series data obtained 
from repeated blood sampling during MTT’s In a mouse model of metabolic syndrome we identified differences in lipid metabolism to be associated with 
variation in weight gain and development of NAFLD (fatty liver disease) The computational model predicted the progression of dyslipidemia to be linked to 
bile acids, which was confirmed in a validation study To investigate the role of bile acids in humans with metabolic syndrome a detailed simulation model of 
bile acid metabolism and physiology was developed Model-based analysis of plasma bile acids provides a metabolic ‘window’ on the gut microbiome and 
other digestive processes in the gastrointestinal tract The model was applied to simulate bariatric surgery in patients with metabolic syndrome The model 
predicts changes in dynamics in the small intestine to result in a stronger and faster GLP-1 response, hence insulin secretion, explaining observations of 
rapid glycemic improvement after surgery The simulation model turned out to be sufficiently robust that personalized variants for individual patients could 
be made, using MTT plasma bile acid metabolomics as input

We have recently introduced a novel scan mode termed ‘parallel accumulation – serial fragmentation’ (PASEF), which promises to overcome longstanding 
limitations in throughput and sensitivity of mass spectrometry-based proteomics (Meier et al, PMID:26538118; Meier et al, PMID:6283298) PASEF 
synchronizes precursor selection with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and achieves over ten-fold increased sequencing rates without loss in 
sensitivity Here we explore the benefits of PASEF for lipidomics We analyzed lipid extracts from human plasma (SRM 1950), mouse liver and HeLa cells via 
nanoflow LC coupled to a high resolution TIMS-QTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker timsTOF Pro) Raw data were processed with MetaboScape (Bruker) and 
MS/MS spectra were annotated with SimLipid (PREMIER Biosoft) As compared with conventional TIMS-MS/MS, we acquired six times more MS/MS scans 
with PASEF, which translated into about twice as many lipid identifications The PASEF speed allowed us to reduce the LC analysis time from 90 to 30 min, 
while still covering over 90% of the lipids identified with the longer gradient Comparison to community efforts reveals an excellent coverage of all major 
lipid classes from just 1 μL plasma The ion mobility dimension further allows separation of isomeric species and provides a high-precision measure of lipid 
collisional cross sections (CCS) with CVs 098) We anticipate that accurate CCS measurements in conjunction with PASEF acquisition will 
greatly benefit metabolomics and lipidomics

Integrating epidemiologic, pharmacologic, genetic and gut microbiome data in the BBMRI-NL drug-
metabolome atlas
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Cornelia van Duijn, University of Oxford, United Kingdom
Progress in high-throughput metabolic profiling provides unprecedented opportunities to obtain insights into the effects of drugs on human metabolism 
The Biobanking BioMolecular Research Infrastructure of the Netherlands (BBMRI-NL) has constructed an atlas of drug-metabolome associations for 87 
commonly prescribed drugs and 150 clinically relevant plasma-based metabolites assessed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) The atlas 
involves a meta-analysis of ten cohorts (18,873 persons) and uncovers 1,071 drug-metabolome associations after evaluating confounding including age, 
sex, weight, smoking and co-treatment Data integration with genetic and pharmaceutical intervention studies on statins shows that cross-sectional data 
of the BBMRI-NL atlas can yield information of future drug effects Further data integration involving epidemiological data links proton pump inhibitors to 
circulating metabolites, biochemical liver-parameters, hepatic steatosis and the gut microbiome Our atlas provides a tool and starting point for targeted 
experimental pharmaceutical research to improve drug efficacy, safety and repurposing We provide a web-based resource for visualisation of the atlas

Metabolic profiling of tissue-specific insulin resistance in human obesity: Results from the Diogenes Study  
and The Maastricht Study

Recent evidence indicates that insulin resistance (IR) in obesity may develop independently in different organs, representing different etiologies towards 
type-2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases The aim of this study was to investigate whether non-diabetic IR in the liver and in the skeletal muscle 
are associated with distinct metabolic profiles Our study included 634 overweight/obese (BMI≥27 kg/m2) adults without diabetes (≤65 years; 63% women) 
of the European multicenter Diogenes Study Hepatic insulin resistance index and muscle insulin sensitivity index were derived from a 5-point oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT) Seventeen plasma metabolites were quantified by nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy In an independent sample of 540 
overweight/obese participants without diabetes (BMI≥27 kg/m2; 40-65 years; 46% women) of The Maastricht Study, 11 metabolites and a 7-point OGTT 
were available for validation Replicated results indicate that both liver and muscle IR are associated with elevated levels of (branched-chain) amino acids 
(isoleucine, alanine), lactate and triglycerides and lower glycine levels, but only liver IR associates with lower ketone body levels (acetoacetate, 3-OH-
butyrate) and elevated levels of ketogenic amino acids (leucine, tyrosine), suggestive of decreased ketogenesis These findings suggest that in early stages 
of cardiometabolic disease development, distinct metabolic profiles of liver IR and skeletal muscle IR can be observed This knowledge might enhance 
developments of more targeted tissue-specific interventions to prevent progression to more severe disease stages

Identification of novel metabolites in alkaptonuria by LC-QTOF-MS profiling and flux analysis of  
a targeted HGD-/- mouse model
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Brendan Norman, Institute of Ageing & Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Brendan P Norman, Juliette H Hughes, Andrew S Davison, Hazel Sutherland, Peter J Wilson, Norman B Roberts,

Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare disorder of tyrosine metabolism caused by congenital lack of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) The primary biochemical 
consequence of HGD-deficiency is elevated circulating homogentisic acid (HGA), which accumulates in cartilage as ‘ochronotic’ pigment causing severe 
early-onset osteoarthropathy Metabolic profiling was performed to investigate for the first time the wider metabolic consequences of HGD-deficiency 
in a new targeted HGD-/- mouse model which recapitulates human AKU Urine from 15 HGD-/- and 14 HGD+/- male age-matched mice was analysed by 
LC-QTOF-MS Data were mined using a published accurate-mass/retention-time database developed in-house from metabolite standards with additional 
compounds of potential interest from wider tyrosine metabolism Comparing profiles of HGD-/- and HGD+/- urine in negative and positive polarity revealed 
that the clearest differences (FDR-adjusted p15) were increases in HGA and 7 previously unreported HGA-derived biotransformation 
products Other metabolites showing clear alteration in HGD-/- included thymidine-5’-diphospho-alpha-D-glucose, DL-3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, 
2-aminophenol, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (increased) malic acid, isocitrate and inosine 5’-monophosphate (decreased) Dehydroxymethylene-HGA, 
HGA-decarboxylate, HGA-glucuronide and HGA-sulfate were subsequently confirmed as derived from HGA in a flux experiment in which HGD-/- mice 
were injected with 13C6-labelled HGA; analysis of plasma taken 2-60 min post-injection showed clear evidence of M+6 isotopologues attributable to 
the 13C6 label The data indicate previously uncharacterised clearance mechanisms for elevated HGA; the central biochemical cause of morbidity in 
AKU Further alteration to urinary metabolites from other pathways including catecholamine, citrate and tryptophan indicate that targeted HGD enzyme 
disruption has wide-ranging and previously unreported metabolic consequences beyond the tyrosine pathway

Obesity is a major health problem associated with extensive metabolic disturbances Identifying the causal connections between obesity and its 
associated metabolites can uncover relevant biology and inform intervention strategies Recent studies have combined metabolite profiling with genetic 
instrumental variable analyses to infer causality between metabolites, obesity, and related diseases In this study, we expand upon previous research 
by using genetic instruments to classify body mass index (BMI)-associated metabolites identified in multiple untargeted metabolomics datasets Meta-
analyses and pathway analyses of both known and unknown metabolites were enabled by our recently developed bioinformatics tool, PAIRUP-MS We 
identified several known metabolites that are more likely to be the cause (eg alpha-hydroxybutyrate) or the effect (eg valine) of higher BMI, or may have 
a more complex bidirectional cause-effect relationship with BMI (eg glycine) Importantly, we also identified about 5 times more unknown than known 
metabolites in each of these three groups Pathway analysis including both known and unknown metabolites identified different enriched metabolic 
pathways in the cause and effect groups, providing further evidence that these metabolite groups are associated with obesity via distinct biological 
mechanisms These findings demonstrate the potential utility of our approach to uncover causal connections with obesity from untargeted metabolomics 
datasets Combining causal inference using genetic data with the ability to match unknown metabolites across datasets provides a path to jointly analyze 
many untargeted datasets with obesity phenotypes, which will be required to generate sufficient power for the robust discovery and replication of causal 
biological relationships between obesity and metabolites

Metabolomics of Ndufs4-/- skeletal muscle: adaptive mechanisms converge at the ubiquinone-cycle
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Karin Terburgh, North-West University, South Africa
CO-AUTHORS: Jeremie Zander Lindeque, Shayne William Mason, Francois Hendrikus van der Westhuizen, Roan Louw
Complex I (CI) deficiency impedes the most efficient mechanism providing electrons to the respiratory chain (RC) — a system that, together with ATP-
synthase, produces most cellular energy Although CI deficiency is the most common mitochondrial defect, it is among the most complex, poorly 
understood disorders currently lacking an effective treatment Current research on the whole-body Ndufs4 knockout (Ndufs4-/-) mouse model aims to 
better understand this disease Although the model’s neurological phenotype has been studied, the effect of CI deficiency on skeletal muscle metabolism 
remains elusive and despite this tissue’s high energetic demand, the phenotype lacks strong muscle involvement We combined hypothesis-generating 
metabolic profiling and enzyme assays to gain insight into the metabolism of glycolytic and oxidative skeletal muscles from Ndufs4-/- mice Multi-platform 
metabolomics was employed, comprising of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 
proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Enzyme assays revealed an 80% reduction in CI activity in both Ndufs4-/- muscle types, which would 
greatly reduce electron flux to the RC As an adaptive response, metabolomics identified that several non-classical pathways participate in an attempt 
to restore electron flux to CIII via the ubiquinone (Q)-cycle Among the numerous discriminatory metabolites identified between Ndufs4-/- and wild-type 
muscles, the most prominent alterations indicate the involvement of the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, electron transfer flavoprotein system, CII, and the 
proline cycle in fuelling the Q-cycle These adaptive mechanisms could maintain adequate ATP production, despite CI deficiency — providing a possible 
explanation for the lack of muscle involvement in the Ndufs4-/- phenotype

Coffee drinking has been associated with lower risk of certain chronic diseases and overall mortality In this work, we used a mass spectrometry-based 
untargeted metabolomic approach (i) to characterize variations in the chemical profiles of 76 coffee brew samples, (ii) to identify biomarkers of coffee intake 
in 451 participants of the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, and (iii) to explore association of coffee-associated 
metabolites in 1:1 matched case-control studies on liver cancer (n=221 cases) and fatal liver disease (n=242 cases) nested in the ATBC cohort PCA analyses 
run on 18 identified coffee compounds showed that the first three principal components were driven respectively by roasting intensity, type of coffee beans 
and caffeination In the EPIC study, 8 coffee metabolites identified in serum samples were highly correlated with coffee intake, with trigonelline showing 
the highest correlation Differences in the magnitude of correlations were observed between countries, possibly explained by preferences in the types 
of coffee consumed In the ATBC cohort, 21 metabolites were jointly associated with coffee intake, liver cancer and liver disease mortality Trigonellline 
and six other metabolites (serotonin, leucyl-valyl, 3 glycerophospholipids and hypoxanthine) were inversely associated with liver cancer and liver disease 
mortality; tyrosine and two bile acids were positively associated with both outcomes This work adds further support to possible hepatoprotective effects 
of coffee consumption It also provides new data on variations of coffee composition and optimal biomarkers of coffee intake important to consider in future 
epidemiological studies
