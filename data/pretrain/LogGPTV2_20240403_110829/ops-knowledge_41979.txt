User: I have a python program that must work on Windows and Linux. There are some configuration options I normally store in a file, in a subdirectory of the program's directory.
For Windows, I converted it to exe and created an Installer for it. And now I have the problem of dealing with the config file.
What is the best place to save the configuration file? I have read that for Windows os.environ['APPDATA']+'myAppName' is the path that must be used. Is it correct? Is it standard? Will it work in all versions of Windows at least from XP (and at least in English and Spanish)?
PD: I am not interested in using ConfigParser. Config file is in my own format and I have working code for reading/writing from it.
Assistant: On Linux, it is common to store the configuration file in the users home directory, for instance ~/.myprogramrc. On windows Vista and up, users have a home directory as well (/Users/username) and a would recommend storing your settings there in a subfolder (/Users/useranem/myprogram). Storing the settings in the application folder will generate UAC warnings.
On Windows XP, users do not have a home folder. Some programs make the choice of putting configuration in the 'My Documents' folder which I guess is as good a place as any.
