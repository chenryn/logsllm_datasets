While tracing codes, found that:
Inside ReactCompositeComponentMixin.mountComponent, the code reads
        // These should be set up in the constructor, but as a convenience for
        // simpler class abstractions, we set them up after the fact.
        inst.props = publicProps;
        inst.context = publicContext;
        inst.refs = emptyObject;
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/shared/reconciler/ReactCompositeComponent.js#L149
However, at ReactClass.createClass, the props and context are set already
          this.props = props;
          this.context = context;
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/isomorphic/classic/class/ReactClass.js#L826
It seems no reason to have duplicated codes.  
Should we remove one of these two code snippets and only keep one ?  
Or is there any reason for this ?
If no other concerns, I would suggest move the setup of the props, context and
refs back to the class constructor.  
Make the duty of constructing and the duty of mounting clear.
