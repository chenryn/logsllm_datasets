User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Restart SSH on a machine where SSH is the only mode of access I've made some changes to sshd_config file and therefore need to restart. I'm looking tips on safely restarting ssh when getting physical access to the server would be a huga PITA.

Assistant: Restarting sshd while logged in via ssh will not disconnect your ssh connection.

If you're worried about your configuration, log in a few times via ssh, and restart. If you can no longer ssh in, with new connections, you now have access to fix the problems.

Mentioned below in a comment by @Milan Babuškov: sshd -t will test your configuration for syntax correctness, if you really want to be certain.

Another suggestion, by @Ronald Pottol was to set up a cron task to restart the server with a known working configuration. Perhaps overkill, but if you're updating a mission critical server, etc... sometimes you can never be too careful.
