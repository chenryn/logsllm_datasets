# DEFCON 15: Multiplatform Malware within the .NET Framework

## Introduction
- **Event:** DEFCON 0x0f (DEFCON 15)
- **Dates:** August 3rd â€“ August 5th
- **Presenter:** Paul Sebastian Ziegler
- **Contact:** PI:EMAIL

## What is Multiplatform Malware?
Multiplatform malware is designed to run on multiple different processors or host operating systems without requiring modifications. It can:
- Operate across various systems.
- Jump from one system to another.
- Take the form of a worm, trojan, or virus.

### Characteristics of Multiplatform Malware
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Runs on several different processors or host operating systems.
- **No Modification Needed:** Does not require changes when moving between systems.
- **Mobility:** Can jump from one system to another.
- **Versatility:** Can be any type of malicious software, such as a worm, trojan, or virus.

### What Multiplatform Malware is Not
- **Common Design Flaws:** It does not exploit common design flaws in broadly used protocols that various operating systems implement (e.g., XSS is not multiplatform malware).
- **Binary Form:** It does not need to be in binary form.

## Recent Developments
- **More Devices:** Increased number of devices.
- **More Operating Systems:** Diverse operating systems.
- **Cross-System Integration:** Greater integration between systems.
- **Increased Mobility:** Enhanced mobility of users and data.
- **Reduced Security Concerns:** Lower security awareness among users.

## Notable Implementations
- **{Win32, Linux}/Simile.D (Virus):** 
  - Infects both PE and ELF executables.
  - Polymorphic and metamorphic.
- **W32/Linux.Bi (PoC Virus):** 
  - Infects local files.

## The Potential of Multiplatform Malware
### I. Jumping Systems
#### The Old Standard
- **Scenario:** A secret service agent needs access to a network, but a hacker spends the night hacking an Xbox360 for savegames instead of gaining network access.
- **Outcome:** The hacker's lack of focus on the mission leads to a humorous and threatening response from the agent.

#### The New Possibilities
- **Scenario:** A new hacker successfully gains access to the network by using a worm that jumps from an Xbox360 to a Vista PC and then to a PocketPC, collecting credentials.
- **Outcome:** The hacker's success is acknowledged, but the agent still responds with a humorous and threatening message.

### II. The Momentum of Surprise
- **Old Common Sense of OS-Security:** If it hurts me, it was built for me.
- **New Common Sense of OS-Security:** I am vulnerable in most cases, regardless of the platform.

### The Way of the Non-Windows L-User
- **Perceived Security:** Belief that running a non-Windows OS (e.g., XYZ) is secure by default.
- **Low Target Profile:** Few people develop malware for non-Windows systems.
- **Isolation Myth:** Belief that a Windows user's infection cannot affect them.
- **Lax Security Practices:** Lack of caution with downloads, attachments, and portable media.

## Ways of Implementing Multiplatform Malware
- **Carrying Various Versions as Payloads:** Includes different versions of the malware.
- **Using Cross-System Compliant Assembler Instructions:** Utilizes instructions compatible with multiple systems.
- **Using Runtime Frameworks and Intermediate Languages:** Leverages frameworks like .NET and intermediate languages.

## Project Akikaze: "p3wn me in .NET darling"
- **Goals:**
  - Create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that works.
  - Attack Thunderbird and spread from there.
  - Explore the possibilities of runtime frameworks.

### Why .NET?
- **CIL-Code Speed:** Fast execution.
- **Multiple Implementations:** Several .NET implementations available.
- **Wide Adoption:** Many people use .NET.
- **Language Independence:** Supports multiple programming languages.
- **No Virtual Machine Restrictions:** No VM limitations.
- **Platform Independence:** Provides many classes for cross-platform support.
- **Microsoft's Involvement:** Known for creating environments that are often exploited by malware.

### Why Thunderbird?
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on many different platforms.
- **Ease of Redistribution:** Attacking a mail client makes it easy to spread the malware.
- **Personal Use:** The presenter uses Thunderbird.

## The Code
- **Source Code:** Available at [https://observed.de](https://observed.de)

## Demonstration
- **Live Demo:** To be presented during the session.

## Limitations of Multiplatform Malware and Runtime Frameworks
### Multiplatform Malware
- **Cross-Platform Code:** Must use code that works on all targeted systems.
- **Complexity:** Becomes more challenging when jumping between different processor architectures.
- **Detection:** Equally detectable by antivirus software as other types of malware.

### Runtime Frameworks
- **Installation Requirement:** Needs to be installed on the target system.
- **Manual Invocation:** May require manual invocation.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Intermediate languages are easily reverse-engineered and analyzed for malicious content.

## Summary
- **Key Points:** Overview of multiplatform malware, its potential, and the challenges it presents.
- **Future Directions:** Further research and development in this area.

## Discussion
- **Q&A Session:** Open floor for questions and discussion.
