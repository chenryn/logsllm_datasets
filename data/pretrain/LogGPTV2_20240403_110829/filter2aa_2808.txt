What exactly is multiplatform malware?
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
● Runs on several different processors or host 
operating systems
● Does not need to be modified from system to system
● Is able to jump from one system to another
● May be anything from worm to trojan to virus
Multiplatform malware...
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
Multiplatform malware does not...
● Attack common design flaws in broadly used 
protocols various operating systems implement 
(XSS is not multiplatform malware)
● Need to be in binary form
DEFCON 15

Recent Developments
● More Devices
● More Operating Systems
● More Cross-System Integration
● More Mobility
● Less Security-Concerns

multiplatform malware up until now
● {Win32, Linux}/Simile.D (Virus)
– Infects both PE and ELF executables
– Polymorphic and Metamorphic
● W32/Linux.Bi
– PoC Virus
– Infects local files

The Old Standard
Secret Service Guy: We need access to that network and we need it now!
Some Geek: Oh... yeah... right. Look, I'm really sorry, but I was extremely busy
tonight. See, when I scanned that employee's firewall I saw that 
his son had an Xbox360 connected to the Internet so I spent all
night hacking it just to get his savegames...
Secret Service Guy: WTF? Do you know what this means? They have 
     200 nuclear warheads stationed around the world!
     Also we believe that they cut 26,72$ tax last year.
Some Geek: Now come on, it's not all bad... At least we can play games for 
free!
Secret Service Guy: Yes, indeed. That is great... Just wait at your house 
     and keep the doors unlocked. I'll send over a
     S.W.A.T-team to... umh... “play”.

The New Possibilities
Secret Service Guy: Ok now. This is your first job after you have been hired 
     since the previous specialist couldn't continue working
     due to... a terrible headache. Also you'll probably have
     heard the tales of how we managed to disarm all the 
     nuclear warheads using a piece of paper and a 
     bottle cap. But now we need access to that network!
Another Geek: Umh, listen... did that other guy tell you the employee's kid had and 
Xbox360 connected to the internet?
Secret Service Guy: Not again! Don't tell me you hacked his saves...
Another Geek: Of course I did! He is really a good gamer. However I also installed
a worm on that Xbox that jumped to their Vista box and collected
all the credentials from our target employee's PocketPC after being
synced onto there as well. I already mailed you the passwords.
Secret Service Guy: Great! You really do know a lot about hacking... and our
     organization... and our plans... Just wait at home and 
     keep your doors unlocked. I'll send over a S.W.A.T 
     team to... uhm... “congratulate” you.

II. The Momentum Of Surprise
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
The old common sense of OS-security:
If it hurts me then it was 
build for me
The new common sense of OS-security:
I am vulnerable in most 
cases - no matter what
DEFCON 15

The way of the Non-Windows L-User
● I am running XYZ and it is secure by default
● Very few people develop malware for XYZ
● If an MS-friend of mine should be infected with 
malware his PC could not infect me anyways
● I do not need to be careful when dealing with 
downloads, attachments and portable media

Ways of implementing mutliplatform 
malware
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
● Carrying various versions as 
payloads
● Using cross-system compliant 
assembler instructions
● Using runtime frameworks and 
intermediate languages

Goals
● Create some PoC that actually works
● Have it attack Thunderbird and spread from there
● Explore the possibilities of runtime frameworks
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
Why .NET?
● CIL-code is fast
● There are several .NET implementations
● Many people run it
● Language independence
● No virtual machine restrictions
● Lots of classes for platform independence
● Microsoft designed it, so it comes from a long 
tradition of great malware-boosters
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
Why Thunderbird?
● It runs on many different platforms
● Attacking a mailclient makes it easy to redistribute 
the malware
● I am using it

Limitations of multiplatform malware 
and runtime frameworks
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
Multiplatform Malware...
● Needs to use code that will work on any system 
targeted
● Will get really nasty once we start to jump in 
between various processor architectures
● Is just as detectable by AV as any other malware
DEFCON 15
Multiplatform malware within the .NET-Framework
Runtime Frameworks...
● Need to be installed
● May need to be invoked manually
● Use intermediate languages that are
– Easily reverse engineered
– Easily analysed for malicious content
