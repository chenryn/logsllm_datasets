of the paper. An undirected graph G = (V, E) contains
a set of nodes V and edges E. For a given set of nodes
S ⊆ V , let N (S) = {w ∈ V − S : ∃v ∈ S s.t. (v, w) ∈ E}
represent the set of (immediate) 1-hop neighbors of S, and
N2(S) = N (N (S)) − (N (S) ∪ S) represent the set of 2-hop
neighbors of S which are at a distance of 2 from S.
System and Threat Models. We consider an open decen-
tralized system in which there is no single authority that can
restrict participation. Each participating entity is expected
to follow the protocol of the system in order to better utilize
the system. However, the open nature of the system at-
tracts adversaries whose primary motive is to deviate from
the protocol and hamper the utility of the system.
Let each participating entity in the system have a unique
identity which can be classiﬁed as either honest or malicious.
An honest identity is uniquely associated with a user that
follows the protocol of the system.
In contrast, malicious
identities are controlled by an adversary aiming to under-
mine the system utility for the honest users. The adversary
may create malicious identities arbitrarily for this purpose,
which is referred to as the Sybil attack [14].
For the Sybil defense, we incorporate and extend some
of the fundamentals of the models and assumptions of the
previous SNSD studies [32, 31, 18, 27, 21], as discussed in
Sec. 2.1, into our system. First, there exists a social net-
work among all honest and Sybil identities. Each identity
has one or more trust relationships with other identities.
Second, the adversary may create trust relationships among
the Sybil identities not only arbitrarily but also based on a

tage. Third, the honest region representing the subgraph of
honest identities and their relationships is fast-mixing [22].
Also, the honest region is a single connected component.
Fourth, the adversary may have complete knowledge of the
honest region. Fifth, the adversary can thus strategically
create, albeit limited, trust relationships (attack edges) be-
tween the honest and Sybil identities.
In addition to the Sybil attack, the system faces the major
challenge of churn. Let unavailability c represent the frac-
tion of all honest users being oﬄine at any given instance.
We expect only a small fraction (1 − c) ∈ [0.05, 0.25], i.e.,
5-25% of all honest users to be online at any given instance.
Let the probability of an honest user v being online is pro-
portional to a small non-negative exponent γ of its number
of trust relationships: Pr(v) ∝ |N ({v})|γ, where N ({v})
represents the set of all the neighbors of v in the honest re-
gion. When γ > 0, honest nodes with higher degree are more
likely to be online than the ones with lower degree at any
given instance. When γ = 0, the probability of an honest
node being online is unrelated to its degree. In contrast, the
adversary can have all of its Sybil identities online all the
time so as to minimize the system utility for honest users.
Goals. The main goal in this work is to enable honest users
securely communicate with each other with a high probabil-
ity in the face of aforementioned strategic Sybil attack and
heavy churn. Under these conditions, the system should be
able to provide with the same level of robustness as the sce-
nario in which all honest nodes are online, in terms of:
• Network Connectivity: There must exist, with a high prob-
ability, at least one path (preferably many paths) between
any two online honest nodes such that all the intermediate
nodes in the path are honest as well.
• Attack Resilience: Generic SNSD schemes must be appli-
cable to the system even under heavy churn.
