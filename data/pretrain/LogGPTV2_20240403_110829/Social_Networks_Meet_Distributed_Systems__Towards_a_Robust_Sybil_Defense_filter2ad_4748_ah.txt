### Graph Definitions

An undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \) consists of a set of nodes \( V \) and a set of edges \( E \). For a given subset of nodes \( S \subseteq V \), the set of 1-hop neighbors of \( S \) is defined as:
\[ N(S) = \{ w \in V \setminus S : \exists v \in S \text{ such that } (v, w) \in E \} \]
This represents the set of immediate neighbors of \( S \).

The set of 2-hop neighbors of \( S \) is defined as:
\[ N_2(S) = N(N(S)) \setminus (N(S) \cup S) \]
This represents the set of nodes that are at a distance of 2 from \( S \) and are not in \( S \) or its 1-hop neighbors.

### System and Threat Models

We consider an open, decentralized system where no single authority can restrict participation. Each participating entity is expected to follow the system's protocol to maximize utility. However, the open nature of the system attracts adversaries whose primary goal is to deviate from the protocol and undermine the system's utility for honest users.

Each participating entity in the system has a unique identity, which can be classified as either honest or malicious. An honest identity is associated with a user who follows the system's protocol. In contrast, malicious identities are controlled by an adversary aiming to disrupt the system's utility for honest users. The adversary may create an arbitrary number of malicious identities, a strategy known as a Sybil attack [14].

### Sybil Defense

For Sybil defense, we incorporate and extend some of the fundamental models and assumptions from previous studies on Social Network-based Sybil Defense (SNSD) [32, 31, 18, 27, 21], as discussed in Section 2.1. Our system assumes the following:

1. **Social Network**: There exists a social network among all honest and Sybil identities, with each identity having one or more trust relationships with other identities.
2. **Adversary Strategy**: The adversary can create trust relationships among Sybil identities arbitrarily or based on a strategy that maximizes their advantage.
3. **Honest Region**: The subgraph of honest identities and their relationships (honest region) is fast-mixing [22] and forms a single connected component.
4. **Adversary Knowledge**: The adversary may have complete knowledge of the honest region.
5. **Limited Trust Relationships**: The adversary can strategically create, albeit limited, trust relationships (attack edges) between honest and Sybil identities.

### Churn Challenge

In addition to the Sybil attack, the system faces the challenge of churn. Let \( c \) represent the fraction of all honest users who are offline at any given time. We expect only a small fraction \( (1 - c) \in [0.05, 0.25] \), i.e., 5-25% of all honest users, to be online at any given time.

The probability of an honest user \( v \) being online is proportional to a small non-negative exponent \( \gamma \) of its number of trust relationships:
\[ \Pr(v) \propto |N(\{v\})|^\gamma \]
where \( N(\{v\}) \) represents the set of all neighbors of \( v \) in the honest region. When \( \gamma > 0 \), honest nodes with higher degrees are more likely to be online. When \( \gamma = 0 \), the probability of an honest node being online is independent of its degree. In contrast, the adversary can keep all its Sybil identities online to minimize the system's utility for honest users.

### Goals

The main goal of this work is to enable secure communication among honest users with high probability, even in the face of strategic Sybil attacks and heavy churn. Under these conditions, the system should provide the same level of robustness as if all honest nodes were online, specifically in terms of:

- **Network Connectivity**: With high probability, there must exist at least one path (preferably multiple paths) between any two online honest nodes, with all intermediate nodes also being honest.
- **Attack Resilience**: Generic SNSD schemes must be applicable to the system even under heavy churn.

#### Exploring 2-Hop Neighbors: Pros & Cons

MCON [28] is one of the first studies to show that high unavailability results in the graph representing the social network becoming highly fragmented. This section discusses the pros and cons of exploring 2-hop neighbors in such a scenario.
