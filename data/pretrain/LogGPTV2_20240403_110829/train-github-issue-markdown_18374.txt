Getting the following error while trying to hydrate SSR content.  
`Expected server HTML to contain a matching  in .`
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem viahttps://jsfiddle.net or similar
(template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15:
https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**
The following check returns false  
react/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOM.js
Lines 453 to 462 in 177cd85
|  canHydrateInstance(  
---|---  
|  instance: Instance | TextInstance,  
|  type: string,  
|  props: Props,  
|  ): boolean {  
|  return (  
|  instance.nodeType === ELEMENT_NODE &&  
|  type.toLowerCase() === instance.nodeName.toLowerCase()  
|  );  
|  },  
as `type` is `linearGradient` and `instance.nodeName.toLowerCase()` is
`lineargradient`
**What is the expected behavior?**
Node types are compared correctly as SVG uses camelCase for tagName
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
React 16
