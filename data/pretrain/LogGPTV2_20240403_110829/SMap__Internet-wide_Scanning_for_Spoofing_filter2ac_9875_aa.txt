ABSTRACT
To protect themselves from attacks, networks need to enforce
ingress filtering, i.e., block inbound packets sent from spoofed IP
addresses. Although this is a widely known best practice, it is still
not clear how many networks do not block spoofed packets. In-
ferring the extent of spoofability at Internet scale is challenging
and despite multiple efforts the existing studies currently cover
only a limited set of the Internet networks: they can either measure
networks that operate servers with faulty network-stack imple-
mentations, or require installation of the measurement software on
volunteer networks, or assume specific properties, like traceroute
loops. Improving coverage of the spoofing measurements is critical.
In this work we present the Spoofing Mapper (SMap): the first
scanner for performing Internet-wide studies of ingress filtering.
SMap evaluates spoofability of networks utilising standard proto-
cols that are present in almost any Internet network. We applied
SMap for Internet-wide measurements of ingress filtering: we found
that 69.8% of all the Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet
do not filter spoofed packets and found 46880 new spoofable ASes
which were not identified in prior studies. Our measurements with
SMap provide the first comprehensive view of ingress filtering de-
ployment in the Internet as well as remediation in filtering spoofed
packets over a period of two years until May 2021.
We set up a web service at https://smap.cad.sit.fraunhofer.de to
perform continual Internet-wide data collection with SMap and
display statistics from spoofing evaluation. We make our datasets
as well as the SMap (implementation and the source code) publicly
available to enable researchers to reproduce and validate our results,
as well as to continually keep track of changes in filtering spoofed
packets in the Internet.

1 INTRODUCTION
Source IP address spoofing allows attackers to generate and send
packets with a false source IP address impersonating other Internet
hosts, e.g., to avoid detection and filtering of attack sources, to
reflect traffic during Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks,
to launch DNS cache poisoning, for spoofed management access
to networking equipment and even to trigger services which can
only be accessible to internal users [8, 11, 13, 32, 39]. The best way
to prevent IP spoofing is by enforcing Source Address Validation
(SAV) on packets, a practice standardised in 2000 as BCP38 [19]:
ingress filtering for blocking inbound packets and egress filtering for
blocking outbound packets sent from spoofed IP source addresses.
In contrast to egress filtering which has been extensively mea-
sured in the last 15 years, only a couple of recent studies provided
measurements on the extent of ingress filtering.
Ingress filtering. To enforce ingress filtering the networks
should check the source address of an inbound packet against a set
of permitted addresses before letting it into the network. Otherwise,
the attackers using spoofed IP addresses belonging to the network
can trigger and exploit internal services and launch attacks. For
instance, by spoofing internal source IP addresses the attackers can
obtain access to services, such as RPC, or spoofed management ac-
cess to networking equipment [RFC3704], the attackers can cause
DoS amplification by triggering the ICMP error messages from
the attacked hosts to other internal hosts whose IP addresses the
attacker spoofed. Enforcing ingress filtering is therefore critical
for protecting the networks and the internal hosts against attacks.
Nevertheless, despite efforts to prevent IP spoofing, it is still a sig-
nificant problem. Attacks utilising IP spoofing remain widespread
[8, 10, 18, 35, 38, 41].
How widespread is the ability to spoof? There are signif-
icant research and operational efforts to understand the extent
and the scope of (ingress and egress)-filtering enforcement and to
characterise the networks which do not filter spoofed packets; we
discuss these in Related Work, Section 2. Although the existing
studies and tools, such as the Open Resolver [34] and the Spoofer
[5–7, 28, 30] projects, provide a valuable contribution for inferring
networks which do not enforce spoofing, they are nevertheless
insufficient: they provide a meager (often non-uniform) coverage
of the Internet networks and are limited in their applicability as
well as effectiveness.
SMap (The Spoofing Mapper). In this work we present the
first Internet-wide scanner for networks that filter spoofed inbound
packets, we call the Spoofing Mapper (SMap). We apply SMap for
scanning ingress-filtering in more than 90% of the Autonomous
Systems (ASes) in the Internet. The measurements with SMap show
that more than 80% of the tested ASes do not enforce ingress filter-
ing (i.e., 72.4% of all the ASes in the routing system), in contrast to
2.4% identified by the latest measurement of the Spoofer Project

[30]. The reason for this significant difference is the limitation of
the previous studies of ingress filtering to a small set of networks.
Limitations of filtering studies. The measurement commu-
nity provided indispensable studies for assessing “spoofability”
in the Internet, and has had success in detecting the ability to
spoof in some individual networks using active measurements, e.g.,
via agents installed on those networks [28, 34], or by identifying
spoofed packets using offline analysis of traffic, e.g., [29, 30]. The
need to install agents on networks or the ability to obtain traces
only from some networks limits the studies to non-uniform cov-
erage of the Internet. Therefore it is not clear how representative
these statistics are. Unfortunately, this limitation to a small set of
networks creates a bias in the assessments of the overall number
of spoofable networks. The extrapolation from the small set of net-
works to the entire Internet typically result in assessment that at
least 30% of the Internet networks do not filter spoofed packets
[30, 32]. As we show, the number of spoofable networks is above
72% which is significantly higher than what was previous believed.
Requirements on Internet studies. The key requirements for
conducting Internet studies upon which conclusions can be drawn
include scalable measurement infrastructure, good coverage of the
Internet and a representative selection of measurement’s vantage
points. We summarise the limitations of the previous studies below
and in Table 1, and compare to SMap.
• Limited coverage. Previous studies infer spoofability based on
measurements of a limited set of networks, e.g., those that operate
servers with faulty network stack [26] or networks with volun-
teers that execute the measurement software [5–7, 28, 30, 34], or
networks that agree to cooperate and volunteer their traffic logs
for offline analysis, e.g., [30]. In contrast, the measurements with
SMap use standard protocols supported by almost any network
with Internet connectivity, for the first time providing studies of
ingress filtering that cover the entire IPv4 space.
• Limited scalability. Previous approaches require installing agents,
need to reproduce loops in traceroutes, or use misconfigurations in
networks which limits their scalability. SMap is more scalable than
any previous approach, since it merely exchanges requests/responses
with networks using a fixed infrastructure of probers. The mea-
surement infrastructure of SMap is not a function of the measured
networks, hence adding more networks to the study does not re-
quire extending the measurement infrastructure.
• Limited representativeness. Volunteer or crowd-sourcing studies,
such as the Spoofer Project [28], are inherently limited due to bias
introduced by the participants. These measurements are performed
using a limited number of vantage points, which are set up in
specific networks, and hence are often not representative of the
entire Internet. Increasing the coverage and selecting the networks
more uniformly is imperative for collecting representative data;
[22] showed that the measured network significantly influences
the resulting data as well as the derived conclusions. Since SMap
measures almost all the IPv4 networks the results are representative
of the entire Internet.
• Limited stability. Current measurement studies use unstable
infrastructures: volunteers running agents can reinstall computers
or move to other networks [34]; misconfigured servers [28] (e.g.,
with open resolution or with faulty network stack) can be updated
– all causing the network to “disappear from the radar” although

it may still be spoofable. Hence, longitudinal studies, such as the
Spoofer Project, are biased by the stability of the vantage points, and
cannot accurately track deployment of ingress filtering in individual
networks. A few works [34] pointed out that the instability of the
infrastructure creates discrepancy in the statistics. In particular,
repeating the measurements a few weeks later generates other
different results.
What SMap improves. The infrastructure of SMap is more
stable than those used in previous studies, e.g., we do not risk vol-
unteers moving to other networks. Our measurements do not rely
on misconfigurations in services which can be patched, blocking
the measurements. The higher stability also allows for more accu-
rate reproduction and validation of our datasets and results, and
enables to perform reliable longitudinal studies. We ran ingress
filtering measurements with SMap every week over a period of two
years (between 10 July 2019 and 10 May 2021). Our results plotted
in Figure 1 demonstrate that the number of spoofable ASes is stable
and proportionally increases with the growth in the overall number
of ASes in the Internet. This is in contrast to previous studies, e.g.,
[27–29], in which a repeated evaluation even a week later provided
different statistics. Our two year long measurements between 2019
and 2021 of more than 90% of Internet’s ASes we found 50,023 new
ASes that do not enforce ingress filtering, which were not known
before, and confirmed all the other ASes that were found spoofable
in prior studies.
Ethical Considerations. Internet-wide scans are important for
security research [16, 31] and have proven valuable in improving the
security landscape of the Internet, including exposing new vulnera-
bilities, tracking adoption of defences. Nevertheless, Internet-wide
scans introduce also ethical challenges. We communicated with
network operators to understand and consider the ethical implica-
tions of Internet-wide scans. We identified two issues as particularly
important for our measurements: traffic load and consent.
• Traffic load. Network scans, such as [16, 26, 31], require ex-
changing packets with a large number of Internet networks as well
as IP addresses inside the networks. To avoid scanning the Internet
we periodically download a dataset of a full scan of the Internet
done by Sonar.
• Consent of the scanned. It is often impossible to request permis-
sion from owners of all the tested networks in advance, this chal-
lenge similarly applies to other Internet-wide studies [15, 16, 26, 31].
Like the other studies, [15, 16], we provide an option to opt out of
our scans. To opt out the network has to provide either its network

block (in CIDR notation), domain or ASN through the contact page
at https://smap.cad.sit.fraunhofer.de. Performing security scans is
important - the networks that do not enforce filtering of spoofed
packets pose a hazard not only to their operators but also to their
users, customers and services, as well as other networks. Due to the
importance of identifying such networks, in their recent study [30]
even make public the (“name-and-shame”) lists of providers with
missing or misconfigured filtering of spoofed packets; [30] also
discuss stronger measures against spoofable networks, including
liability for damages, and various types of regulation. Inevitably,
due to the risks that such networks pose to the Internet ecosystem,
it is of public interest to know who those networks are. We do
not make the identity of the networks, that do not filter spoofed
packets, publicly available, but inform the general public on the
fraction of such networks and provide their characterisation (i.e.,
size, geo-location, business type) in Section 5.
Undoubtedly, filtering spoofed packets is critical and networks
have to deploy best practices, such as BCP38 [19] and BCP84 [3],
to ensure security of the Internet ecosystem. Understanding the
extent of filtering is also significant for devising future policies,
defence mechanisms or estimating threats and risks to attacks.
Organisation. Our work is organised as follows: we compare
our study and SMap to related work in Section 2. In Section 3
we present the design and the implementation of SMap and the
measurement techniques that it uses. In Section 4 we report on the
data collected with SMap and the statistics that we derived from
it. We characterise the networks which we found not to enforce
ingress filtering in Section 5. We conclude this work in Section 6.
2 OVERVIEW OF SPOOFING STUDIES
2.1 Egress vs. Ingress
Although there are a few studies of ingress filtering, most studies
of spoofing focus on egress filtering. What can be inferred from
egress filtering on igress filtering and vice versa?
In their recent measurement of ingress and egress filtering [30]
conclude that filtering of inbound spoofed packets is less deployed
than filtering of outbound packets, despite the fact that spoofed
inbound packets pose a threat to the receiving network. [25] anal-
ysed the networks from Spoofer and open resolver projects and
found that 74% of the networks that do not filter outbound spoofed
packets, do not filter inbound spoofed packets. A more recent study
[24] of 515 ASes found that ingress filtering of inbound spoofed
packets is more widely deployed than egress filtering of outbound
packets.
The correlation between egress and ingress filtering in previous
work shows that the measurements of ingress filtering also provide
a lower bound on the number of networks that enforce egress
filtering of spoofed outbound packets. Therefore our results on
networks that do not enforce ingress filtering imply that at least as
many networks do not perform egress filtering.
2.2 Measurements of Spoofability
Measurements of networks that filter spoofed packets in the In-
ternet was previously done using network traces or using vantage
points. We summarise the results of the previous studies in Table 1,
and briefly explain them below.
Vantage Points. Measurement of networks which do not per-
form egress filtering of packets with spoofed IP addresses was first
presented by the Spoofer Project in 2005 [5]. The idea behind the
Spoofer Project is to craft packets with spoofed IP addresses and
check receipt thereof on the vantage points operated by the volun-
teers, i.e., participants who run a “spoofer” software provided by the
authors. Based on the data collected by the Spoofer Project many
