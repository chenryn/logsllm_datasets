Characterizing Mail Service Provider Usage

they do not seek local alternatives). Similarly, the dominance of
Tencent and Yandex in their local markets may, in part, reflect mar-
keting and infrastructure deployment advantages in their home
countries. However, a key role may also be played by state-imposed
security review requirements in those countries that US service
providers are unwilling or unable to meet. Regardless of reason, the
key result is the same: the centralization of e-mail service has been
heterogeneous across the globe, with certain providers dominating
certain markets. However, it is primarily US-based e-mail service
providers who have been effective in attracting foreign customers,
despite the additional legal risks posed by this arrangement.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented a methodology for mapping Inter-
net domains to mail service providers. Our methodology combines
DNS data with active measurement data to significantly improve
accuracy. We have applied this technique to large sets of domains to
identify and characterize the current distribution of dominant mail
providers. Additionally, our longitudinal study over four years has
empirically documented the steady consolidation of Internet e-mail
service towards a small number of providers. Finally, we explore
the extent to which nationality (and hence legal jurisdiction) plays
a role in such mail provisioning decisions.
