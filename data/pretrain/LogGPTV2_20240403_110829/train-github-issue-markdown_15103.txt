Calling `atom.cmd filename` on windows, or opening with `node atom.js
filename` , always ends up with UTF-8 encoding, even if its not. Auto-detect
doesn't seem to be triggered when opened from arguments.
However, manually triggering auto-detect seems to do the trick.
But this is serious, as there is no warning of any kind, and the file will end
up being filled up with garbage due to wrong encoding, with no way to reverse
it.
