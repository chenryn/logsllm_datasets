Question: Consider an Android application that requires strong security services for cryptographic operations. The app leverages Android's Keystore system for hardware-backed key management. Which of the following are advantages and disadvantages of using hardware-backed keys as opposed to software-only key management solutions?
"A": "Advantage: Hardware-backed keys can provide a usage control scheme to mitigate the risk of security compromise due to misuse of keys.",
"B": "Disadvantage: Hardware-backed keys prevent key attestation, making it impossible to verify a key's configuration remotely.",
"C": "Advantage: Hardware-backed keys enforce access controls for the lifetime of the key, enhancing security.",
"D": "Disadvantage: Hardware-backed keys are restricted to asymmetric cryptographic operations and do not support symmetric cryptography such as AES and HMAC."
Answer: AC
