Challenge Use a CSS Class to Style an Element has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; SM-T670 Build/LMY47X)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/50.0.2661.89 Safari/537.36`.  
Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    CatPhotoApp
    Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.
I have made all required changes, but it still says the h2 element isn't red.
I have tried entering the changes in a different order, and have tried
clearing browser history and cache. Nothing seems to fix the issue.
