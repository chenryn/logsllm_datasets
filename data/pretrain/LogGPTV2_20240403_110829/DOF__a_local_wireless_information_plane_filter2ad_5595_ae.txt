detection errors are present, they account for a small fraction of the
overall errors. Asynchrony detection errors occur when the offset
between different transmissions is shorter than the cyclic feature pro-

cessing time. Because an FFT of length 512 using FFTW [1] can be
performed in 4(cid:22)s and the extra complexity of cyclic feature extrac-
tion is < 30% over that of a standard FFT (sec. 5), the probability
of repeatedly missing the offset between asynchronous transmissions
(WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth all have packet lengths on the order of
100’s of (cid:22)s to a few ms) is small.
The main reason for the lower accuracy is that certain low-power
and low-bandwidth signals are not detected in some corner cases
when there is strong frequency overlap. Fig. 6 plots the accuracy
of our classiﬁcation for different signal types as a function of the
frequency overlap from another signal. Frequency overlap between
signals of the same type is rare because their identical MAC proto-
cols act as a mechanism to prevent this. When signals do overlap, this
is because they are of different types. Referring to Table 1, different
types of signals centered at the same carrier frequency exhibit distinct
patterns. Thus overall, DOF’s classiﬁcation accuracy does not dete-
riorate drastically when signals overlap, except for Bluetooth, which
we can see drops with increasing overlap. The reason is that Blue-
tooth signals have a low bandwidth of 1 MHz. If the signal is over-
lapped in frequency by a stronger signal like WiFi, then DOF fails
to even detect the Bluetooth signal. Bluetooth signals only have a
few unique features because of their simple structure and small band-
width, while a WiFi signal has a rich feature set some of which are
close to the Bluetooth pattern frequencies. Consequently, DOF ends
up not detecting the Bluetooth signal, resulting in lower accuracy.
6.2 Estimating Occupied Spectrum
In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of DOF’s spectrum oc-
cupancy estimation, and compare it with the edge detection based
approach in Jello [28]. To make a fair comparison, we allow Jello to
use the same 512 length FFT as DOF.
Method: The experiment is conducted similar to the above classi-
ﬁcation experiments and the raw dump of the received signal at our
wideband radio is sent to DOF’s and Jello’s spectrum occupancy esti-
mators. We take the estimated occupied spectrum from both systems,
and compute the absolute error for both. The error is computed as
the sum of the estimated occupied spectrum components that are not
actually occupied plus the estimated unoccupied spectrum which is
actually occupied. We normalize the error by the ground truth spec-
trum occupancy. We plot two separate ﬁgures, Fig. 7(a) plots the error
vs SNR of the detected signal when there is a single received signal
in the trace and Fig. 7(b) plots the CDF of normalized errors when
there are more than 1 potentially overlapping signals in the trace.
Analysis: Fig. 7(a) shows that DOF is reasonably accurate in estimat-
ing occupied spectrum. The normalized error in estimating occupied
spectrum is around 15% at low SNR and reduces to 5% at higher
SNR, but never approaches 0 because of the FFT size which inher-
ently limits resolution.
Figure 8: AoA Estimation Accuracy - Single Signal accuracy is accurate
even at low SNRs but when multiple radios are operating, there are often
more signiﬁcant AoA’s than our detectors are able to discern, a funda-
mental limit due to the number of antennas in our system.
Fig: 7(b) plots the CDF of errors when there is more than one signal
in the received trace. DOF achieves a median error of 15% in these
experiments, slightly higher than the single sender case. Apart from
the FFT resolution, the other contributor to the error is overlapping
signals in the frequency domain. As in the classiﬁcation case, when
a strong signal overlaps in frequency with a weak signal like Blue-
tooth, it becomes hard to even detect that the Bluetooth signal exists
and consequently we miss its feature vector components. Hence, the
spectrum occupancy error is slightly higher.
Jello performs less accurately, especially at low SNR and with mul-
tiple interfering signals. The reason is that edge detection (the tech-
nique used in Jello) is based on computing the slope of the PSD.
However, at low SNRs noise introduces sufﬁcient ﬂuctuations that
we encounter large slopes in the derivative of the signal at frequencies
away from where the transmitted signal lies. Further, edge detection
can get confused when there are two partially overlapping signals in
frequency. The reason is that when the overlap ends, there will be a
sharp drop in the PSD level (because we went from two signals to one
signal at that frequency). This can be mistaken to be the end of the
occupied spectrum since the PSD is relatively ﬂat after that transition.
Consequently, as we see in Fig. 7 Jello has a higher median error of
40% in our experiments.
6.3 Estimating Angle of Arrival
In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of DOF’s AoA estimation
component. However, unlike the prior experiments, we cannot com-
pare against ground truth here. The indoor environment is a multipath
environment, and a transmitted signal can arrive at multiple angles si-
multaneously. We have no way of knowing exactly what scattering
takes place and consequently the ground truth AoAs. Hence we con-
duct the experiment as follows: We use two of our wideband radios,
one equipped with 4 antennas and another with 8 antennas arranged
in a ULA. As in the previous experiments, we randomly pick a subset
of the radios among our ﬁve different types, place them at a random
location and let them transmit. For the trace from the 8-antenna radio,
we apply the standard MUSIC technique [23] to estimate all AoAs.
The reason is that with such a large antenna array, MUSIC is almost
guaranteed to accurately ﬁnd all the signiﬁcant AoAs. We consider
these angles to be the ground truth.
Next, we give the trace collected at the 4-antenna radio to DOF as
well as SecureAngle’s [27] MUSIC method. Our logic for picking 4
antennas is to make it consistent with state of the art MIMO hardware,
which comes with around 4 antennas. We then compute the absolute
error of the estimates from DOF and SecureAngle, which is computed
by summing the following values: absolute value of each estimated
angle minus the closest ground truth angle. The absolute error is

Fig. 8(a) plots the
normalized angle error vs the SNR when the trace contains a single
signal type, while Fig. 8(b) plots the CDF of normalized errors when
it contains more than one signal.
Analysis: Fig. 8(a) shows that DOF computes the AoAs with an ac-
curacy of at least 5 degrees even at low SNRs when there is a single
signal. SecureAngle’s accuracy is similar. The reason for the rela-
tively worse performance at very low SNR is that the estimation al-
gorithm uses projections of the Spectral Correlation Function matrix
to compute angles of arrival, and the projections have a slight contri-
bution from noise. At very low SNRs, the contribution is relatively
signiﬁcant, and hence causes a higher estimation error.
As we see in Fig. 8(b) both DOF and SecureAngle perform slightly
worse when there are multiple signals. DOF’s median error is around
14 degrees, while SecureAngle’s is 19 degrees. The reason is that
the number of AoAs that can be accurately detected is a function of
the number of antennas a radio has. With 4 antennas, we can detect
at most 4 signiﬁcant angles of arrival [23]. However with multiple
signals in a rich multipath environment, there will be signiﬁcant sig-
nal strength along a number of angles, sometimes larger than 4. Both
DOF and SecureAngle get confused in this case. However, we note
that this is a fundamental problem [23], regardless of the algorithm,
the number of antennas a node has places a sharp upper bound on
how many AoAs can be distinguished.
7. APPLICATION TO SMART RADIOS
The most direct uses of DOF are in designing smart radios, net-
work management, indoor localization and performance diagnosis.
While we leave most of these to future work, we design DOF-SR, a
preliminary prototype of a wideband smart radio to demonstrate the
beneﬁts of DOF. Our design is inspired by recent work in smart ra-
dios, including Jello [28] and others [22]. We compare DOF-SR with
Jello [28], the most recent state of the art system for such designs.
7.1 DOF-SR
DOF-SR is a wideband policy-aware smart radio design that op-
erates over the entire 100MHz ISM band. The key technical contri-
bution in DOF-SR is its ability to take advantage of the accurate de-
tecting substrate DOF provides to let users specify a policy that tunes
how aggressive the radio is going to be in scavenging for spectral re-
sources. To demonstrate the policy ﬂexibility, we design three sample
policies and implement them in our current prototype of DOF-SR
1. P0: Only use unoccupied spectrum.
2. P1: Use all unoccupied spectrum. Further use spectrum occu-
pied by microwave oven radiation.
3. P2: Use all unoccupied spectrum as well as parts occupied by
microwave oven radiation. Further, compete for spectrum oc-
cupied by WiFi radios and get half the time share on that part
of the spectrum.
The three policies are ordered in increasing amounts of aggressive-
ness. The ﬁrst policy plays it safe and is similar to the one used by
Jello. The second is more aggressive, but still avoids harming any
co-existing radio that is used for communication. The third is the
most aggressive, and encodes the notion that since WiFi is also an-
other unlicensed radio, it is fair to compete and obtain half the time
on spectrum used by WiFi too. However, our key point is that there
is no “universal right policy", it will depend on the user’s preferences
and environmental constraints, but DOF-SR provides the ﬂexibility
needed to adapt the policy to those preferences and constraints.
7.1.1 Protocol
Measuring the RF Neighborhood: DOF-SR uses DOF as the sub-
strate to accurately measure the RF environment and create a RF-
Figure 9: Evaluated scenario for DOF-SR
proﬁle. In our design, both DOF-SR sender and receiver radios mea-
sure the environment using DOF, and the receiver sends its measure-
ments to the sender. The measurement consists of the 2-D proﬁle of
the RF environment along the frequency and spatial (AoA) axes that
DOF estimates, with each occupied point annotated by the occupying
signal type. The sender combines the measurements from the receiver
by taking the union of both spectrum occupancy measurements, but
uses the AoA estimates from the receiver since AoA is speciﬁc to the
detecting radio and only matters at the receiver for communication.
Estimating what spectral resources to use: Next, the sender uses
the merged RF proﬁle along with the user speciﬁed policy to estimate
what spectral resources to use. For policy P0, this would be only the
unoccupied spectrum, while for P1 and P2 this would also include
spectrum occupied by microwave ovens and WiFi respectively.
Creating Packets: DOF uses an OFDM-MIMO PHY layer to create
its packets for transmission. The key challenge here is to adaptively
leverage the 4 antenna MIMO frontend to maximize throughput while
minimizing interference from and to the co-existing radios. We ﬁrst
discuss how the system would work for the simplest policy P0, and
then extend it to work for the other two policies.
Our current OFDM implementation uses a 1024 point FFT, and di-
vides the 100MHz band into 1024 subcarriers of length 96KHz each.
Among these subcarriers, it marks all subcarriers that intersect with
the occupied parts from the RF proﬁle as unusable. On the remaining
subcarriers it uses MIMO spatial multiplexing to transmit 4 indepen-
dent streams on each subcarrier. We omit the details here, but refer
the reader to [26] for a description of this standard technique.
For policies P1 and P2, we modify the above algorithm to take
advantage of their aggressiveness. Speciﬁcally, for P1 we include the
subcarriers that were detected to be occupied by microwave ovens
in the RF proﬁle. However, we cannot use spatial multiplexing on
these subcarriers, since the interference from the microwave signals
would be too strong. Instead we leverage the 4 MIMO antennas to
perform beamforming and null the interference from the microwave
oven signals. Speciﬁcally, lets say the microwave oven signals are
arriving at i signiﬁcant AoAs (cid:18)1; : : : ; (cid:18)i at the DOF-SR receiver. The

sender calculates antenna weights ~wS
subcarrier centered at fp, which is interfered by the microwave oven,
such that the transmitted signal will not arrive at the same angles
as the microwave. The receiver will then calculate antenna weights

signal from the estimated AoAs at the receiver will be minimized:
