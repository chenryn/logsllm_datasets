**Table 2: Comparison of Connected Client Distribution in Our Dataset (November 2009) and Swarm Crawl Results (August 2009)**

We compare the connected client distribution in our dataset from November 2009 with the results from a swarm crawl conducted in August 2009, which involved 400 swarms [27]. As shown in Table 2, there is a strong correspondence in both client rank and market share between the two datasets. This indicates that our dataset is not significantly biased.

Overall, we find no strong evidence of significant bias in our dataset using any of these metrics. In the following sections, we will use this dataset to analyze the network impact of BitTorrent, starting with a description of observed usage patterns and trends.

### 4. BitTorrent Usage Trends

In this section, we use our BitTorrent traces to analyze key usage trends that affect the system’s network impact. Despite reports of declining usage [17], we find that the absolute volume of BitTorrent traffic continues to rise. Additionally, we observe that BitTorrent's temporal usage patterns are increasingly aligned with diurnal traffic patterns, which has implications for its contribution to ISPs' costs.

#### 4.1 Sampling Methodology

Obtaining representative, longitudinal snapshots of BitTorrent traffic and user behavior is challenging due to the high degree of churn in the system. To enable comparisons across multiple time scales, we aggregate user statistics at one-hour granularity and then randomly sample our dataset to obtain a constant number of users (1,000) during each hour for inclusion in our analysis. We repeat this random sampling five times to derive a statistically significant average for each hour. The standard deviations of our samples are relatively small, and we include corresponding error bars in our figures.

Our analysis focuses on comparisons using the second week of every two months over the year of study. In some cases, we use data collected in November 2008 to analyze trends over two years.

#### 4.2 Key Trends

We examine trends in overall BitTorrent traffic in terms of the number of connected peers and per-peer download volumes.

**Figure 2: Average Per-Peer Hourly Download Volume (November 2009 to 2010)**

As Figure 2 shows, the hourly download volumes per peer have grown consistently over the period, increasing by 25% on average.

Beyond the download volumes generated by users, we identify two important and related trends:
1. **Number of BitTorrent Users**: Variations in the number of connected peers may indicate changes in the size of the overall BitTorrent population.
2. **Temporal Patterns of User Activities**: Understanding the temporal patterns behind user activities is necessary to understand the potential contributions of BitTorrent to congestion and near-peak transit charging rates.

**Figure 3: Distribution of Connected Peers per Hour (Grouped by Continent, 2008 and 2010)**

We plot weekly timelines of the number of peers connected to each vantage point in 2008 and 2010 (Figure 3). Focusing on Europe, the largest contributor to connected peers, we observe increasingly defined diurnal patterns with peak usage in the late evening and larger peaks and troughs in 2010 compared to 2008. This is surprising given the common belief that BitTorrent is used out-of-phase with other applications due to the high load it imposes on users' connections [17].

**Figure 4: Average Daily Peak-to-Trough Ratio of Hourly Peers by Continent (2008 to 2010)**

To better illustrate changes in diurnal patterns, we plot the average peak-to-trough ratio of hourly connected peers by continent (Figure 4). Larger ratio values indicate that greater portions of peers in each region use BitTorrent at the same time. The figure shows that the ratio of connected peers in North America has remained consistently high over the last two years, with 80% more peers online during peak usage. Meanwhile, diurnal patterns in Europe have become more pronounced during the same period. While the exact causes for this behavior are beyond the scope of this paper, we speculate that variations in copyright law and enforcement (which can affect how long users leave BitTorrent running) across time and regions may contribute to this effect.

**Table 3: Summary of Calculations to Determine Overall BitTorrent Traffic (2009 to 2010)**

| Metric | 2009 | 2010 | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Peer download rate (MB/hr) | 110.9 | 138.7 | +25.0% |
| Unique peers per hour | 276.6 | 248.0 | -10.3% |
| Concurrent flows | 32.7 | 28.9 | -11.6% |
| Per-flow download rate (MB/hr) | 3.39 | 4.80 | +41.5% |
| Total flows | 9040 | 7170 | -20.7% |
| Total download rate (MB/hr) | 30700 | 34400 | +12.1% |

The reduction in the number of flows per peer results in an increase in the per-flow download rate of 41.5%. Thus, while the total number of flows in the system has shrunk by 20.7%, the BitTorrent traffic has had a net increase of 12.1% between 2009 and 2010.

### 5. Where BitTorrent Flows

We now discuss where BitTorrent traffic flows through the network. We begin with a discussion of how to map traffic flows to the network paths they traverse. We use these mappings to study the geographic and topological characteristics of the traffic exchanged between users from March through the end of May 2010.

**Figure 2: Average Per-User Hourly Download Volume (November 2009 to 2010)**

**Figure 4: Average Daily Peak-to-Trough Ratio of Hourly Peers by Continent (2008 to 2010)**

**Figure 3: Distribution of Connected Peers per Hour (Grouped by Continent, 2008 and 2010)**

To address the challenges in obtaining a complete view of the network, we supplement the public view with traceroutes collected between our vantage points and their connected peers.
