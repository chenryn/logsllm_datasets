Setting both options `"index.auto_expand_replicas":"0-all"` and
`"cluster.routing.allocation.same_shard.host": true` causes unallocated shards
in a cluster.
E.g. in a cluster with 5 physical hosts and 10 Elasticsearch instances (2
instances/host) the settings cause 5 unallocated shards per an index.
Is this the correct behavior?  
Thanks!
P.S. Tested on Elasticsearch-1.4.4
