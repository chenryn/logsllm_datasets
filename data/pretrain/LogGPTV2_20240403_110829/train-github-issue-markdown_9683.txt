I wrote some code to index/percolate documents, and I have a unit test that
creates an index (with a random name) then runs my indexations / search code,
then deletes the index. This means that I have percolators with identical IDs
in different indexes.
When I percolate my documents, I specify a query string for the percolators :
    testindex-2b086e73/doc/a889db29-2409-4174-9425-818eb7293b57?percolate=SourceId:1
And then the result contains duplicate percolator IDs, as if the index name
was ignored :
    {
        "ok" : true,
        "_index" : "testindex-17eecc11",
        "_type" : "doc",
        "_id" : "824f26e4-76a6-4b66-9cb2-f3adc0103586",
        "_version" : 1,
        "matches" : ["1.789", "1.789", "1.789"]
    }
But when I don't specify a query for the percolators (?percolate=*) the result
only contains one ID as expected.
**Edit:**  
I feel like it's an intended behavior in
(https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/percolator/PercolatorExecutor.java#L345)
is it? If yes, how do I filter percolators only on one documenttype/index?
