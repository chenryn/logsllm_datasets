OpenSSL). It should not necessitate any changes in applications
using TLS. TrustBase [74] could be a candidate. Further, recent re-
search shows the applicability of local revocation lists like OneCRL
even for an efficient revocation of leaf certificates [54]. Making
such approaches the default would significantly improve the safety
and robustness of the whole Web PKI.
7 RELATED WORK
While there is a large body of work that examines different facets
of the PKI [2, 46, 56, 81, 87] as well as the TLS and the HTTPS
ecosystem [34, 48], most studies do not mention or examine cross-
signing. In their 2013 Systematization of Knowledge paper, Clark
and Oorschot give a thorough review of the issues of the Web
PKI [28]. In this paper, the authors already note the problem of
revoking CA certificates. They also mention that CA certificates
may not even contain the necessary information for revocation
checking. One of the first studies of the HTTPS ecosystems per-
formed by Durumeric et al. already noted a high occurrence of
cross-signing among CA certificates in 2013 [35]. However, their
analysis is limited to an overview on the occurrence of general
cross-signing and a very brief statement on effect on root store
coverage without any further analysis. Acer et al. [1] analyzed
the causes for certificate validation errors encountered by Chrome
users during web browsing. They find that missing cross-sign cer-
tificates in a presented certificate path cause some errors and thus
acknowledge the importance of cross-signing as means to root trust
in widely trusted stores. Roosa et al. [80] identified cross-signing as
one of the mechanisms that cause intransparency in PKI systems
as CAs do not disclose cross-sign relationships when applying for
inclusion in a root store. Only since April 2018, CAs must report all
intermediates that provide a path to a root in Mozilla’s root store
and are not constrained to specific domain subtrees [60, 61]. Ca-
sola et al. [24] enable CAs to automatically check the compatibility
of their policies before cross-signing. We highlight problems beyond
policies and provide guidelines for a safe operation of cross-signs.
There is a large amount of work that examines different aspects
of certificate revocation. Most studies, however, concentrate on the
revocation of end-host certificates and do not detail the impact of
revocation of intermediates or the interaction with cross-signing.
Liu et al. measure certificate revocation in the Web PKI [58]. While
they mention the importance of revoking intermediate certificates,
their study only measures leaf-certificate revocations.
8 CONCLUSION
Our longitudinal study shows that cross-signing is a common prac-
tice in the Web PKI. We provide a classification of possible cross-sign
patterns and analyze their use in and their effect on real world com-
munications. We show that cross-signs are used to bootstrap trust
in new CAs—which played a significant role in the tremendous
success of Let’s Encrypt. Cross-signs also lead to better trust-store
coverage, giving CAs trust in stores they are not directly trusted
in. Finally, cross-signing allows for a graceful transition to newer
cryptographic algorithms like done in the case of SHA-2.
However, our work also highlights the problems that cross-
signing introduces to PKIs, the largest being unwanted trust paths.
Cross-signing complicates the already error-prone revocation pro-
cesses of certificates. It led to numerous incomplete revocations.
We also show that introducing new cross-signs requires extensive
checks to prevent accidental PKI boundary breaches. Cross-signing
also makes it hard for observers to determine if trust paths are
legitimate—or just forgotten artifacts of past contractual relation-
ships between CAs.
Based on the gathered insights, we propose new cross-signing
best practices. It is our hope to initiate and steer the discussion for
new rules that preserve the beneficial potential of cross-signing but
mitigate its risks.

A ETHICS OF DATA COLLECTION
The passive data collection effort that we perform has been cleared
by the respective responsible parties at each contributing institution
before they begin contributing. Our data-collection effort generally
leverages the already existing network security monitoring infras-
tructure at the contributing institutions: the data collection effort
is generally run by the network security teams of the contributing
institutions on their already existing network monitoring platforms.
We just provide them with a short script (which they can examine)
that performs the TLS data extraction.
This script only extracts data that is not privacy sensitive - or
anonymizes it before the data is sent to us. For example, it does
not include the client IP address. Instead, the data that we are sent
contains a seeded hash of the concatenation of the client and the
server IP addresses. The seed is site-specific and unknown to us.
This approach allows us to determine when the same client
connects to the same server repeatedly (e.g. to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of session resumption), without enabling us to track which
sites a single client accesses.
Moreover, note that we also do not include client-certificates in
our data collection; we only collect certificates that Internet servers
send to clients.
B DETAILS AND FURTHER EXAMPLES
In the following, we detail some already presented XS-Certs and
provide further examples for some cross-signing categories.
B.1 WoSign & StartCom: Early Cross-Signing
As briefly noted in Section 5.1.1, StartCom started cross-signing
WoSign certificates years before being acquired by them and cross-
signing continued after the acquisition. Specifically, StartCom Cer-
tificate Authority cross-signed the Certification Authority of WoSign
in 2006, but revoked the cross-signs in March 2017. However, a
further cross-sign of WoSign CA Limited was not revoked before
2018. StartCom also issued the intermediate WoSign eCommerce
Services Limited, which was cross-signed by Certplus later on, in
2011 (cf. Section 5.1.1). These cross-signs do not yield undesired
trust paths since the StartCom roots were constrained by Mozilla’s
and Google’s not before constraints. However, they show a close
business relationship between StartCom and WoSign years before
the (not timely reported) acquisition of StartCom by WoSign in
2015.
This behavior continued after the acquisition: StartCom Certi-
fication Authority issued and Certification Authority of WoSign G2
cross-signed the new intermediate StartCom Class 3 OV Server CA.
B.2 Bootstrapping: Further Examples
Cross-signing enables CAs to bootstrap trust in certificates while
waiting for their inclusion in root stores. We discussed several cases
in Section 5.3. In the following, we provide the full list of CAs for
which we identified bootstrapping cases. In our dataset, we found
bootstrapping cases for Comodo, USERTrust, DigiCert, VeriSign,
Verizon, Cybertrust, Let’s Encrypt, IdenTrust, WoSign, AffirmTrust,
GlobalSign, Actalis, Starfield Services, Amazon, T-Systems, WellsSe-
cure, Dell Inc., SECOM, TeliaSonera, Unizeto, CertiPath, Certipost,
SCEE, Chunghwa Telecom, Carillon Information Security Inc., ORC
PKI, TAIWAN-CA.COM Inc., Hongkong Post ARGE DATEN - Aus-
trian Society for Data Protection, CNNIC, the U.S. Government, the
Swiss Government, and the Belgium Root.
B.3 Expanding Trust and Alternative Paths:
Further Examples and Comodo Details
As noted in Section 5.4, some root certificates are included in only
some root stores. Consequently, a single issuer may provide only
limited trust. Cross-signs by selected CA certificates can close these
holes by providing trust paths to uncovered root stores.
Increasing Trust Store Coverage. We find three XS-Certs that
B.3.1
use cross-signing to increase their root store coverage. The interme-
diate XS-Certs Servision Inc., XiPS and KAGOYA JAPAN Inc. were
issued by GoDaddy’s ValiCert Class 1 Policy Validation Authority in
2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. The ValiCert certificate provides
trust paths for Mozilla, Google, and Apple, but not for Microsoft’s
root store. To expand the root store coverage, all three intermediates
were cross-signed by the broadly trusted Security Communication
RootCA1 of SECOM end of 2012, which validated issued certificates
for the Microsoft ecosystem, too.
Furthermore, the ValiCert root was removed from the root stores
of Mozilla and Google around 2014 and 2015 due to the deprecation
of certificates that use RSA keys with less than 2048 bit [11, 12].
The intermediates, however, remained trusted due to the cross-sign
by SECOM. The same holds for Apple’s root store when it removed
the ValiCert root in 2018. Thus, cross-signing can not only provide
a broad trust coverage but also keeps intermediates operable in the
face of trust-store removals of their issuers.
Unizeto did not only cross-sign WoSign roots (cf. Section 5.1.1),
but also provided SSL.com with trust on Apple devices. Specifically,
Certum Trusted Network CA cross-signed the roots SSL.com Root
CA RSA and SSL.com RV Root CA RSA R2. Both roots, while created
2016 and 2017, respectively, were not included in root stores before
2018. The cross-signs by Certum in 2018 extended trust to Apple’s
root store which did not include the roots before 2019.
Fall-Back Trust Paths. Cross-signs that increase the root
B.3.2
store coverage often also establish fall-back trust paths which proac-
tively provide alternatives for unexpected revocations. Specifically,
the SECOM cross-sign (Section B.3.1) provided trust paths for cer-
tificates of Servision, XiPS, and KAGOYA JAPAN after the originally
issuing ValiCert certificate was removed from Mozilla and Google
root stores due to its 1024 bit RSA key [11, 12].
Also Entrust maintains a small internal cross-signing intercon-
nection to establish fall-back trust paths for already broadly trusted
roots: Entrust.net Secure Server Certificate Authority cross-signed
Entrust.net Certificate Authority and Entrust Root Certificate Au-
thority. The latter furthermore cross-signed Entrust Root Certificate
Authority - G2 and Entrust Root Certificate Authority - EC1. Beyond
these internal cross-signs, Entrust also received external cross-signs
by today’s members of the Digicert group (cf. Sections B.5.2).
Apart from its cross-signing to bootstrap new roots (cf. Sec-
tion 5.3.3), GoDaddy also maintains internal XS-Certs which es-
tablish alternative trust paths for already well trusted roots. In
2009, the bootstrapped Starfield Class 2 CA cross-signed Starfield
CCS ’20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA

Services Root Certificate Authority - G2. Starfield Services Root Cer-
tificate Authority added another cross-sign to this root XS-Cert. In
2014, Starfield Class 2 CA also cross-signed Starfield Root Certificate
Authority - G2. Similarly in 2014, Go Daddy Class 2 Certification
Authority cross-signed Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2, es-
tablishing alternative trust paths. Beyond these internal cross-signs,
Go Daddy’s ValiCert Class 1 Policy Validation cross-signed SECOM
Security Communication Root CA1, again establishing fall-back trust
paths for an already well-trusted root.
Also GlobalSign creates fall-back trust paths via cross-signing.
Besides its incompletely revoked XS-Cert GlobalSign Extended Vali-
dation CA - SHA256 - G2 (cf. Section 5.1.3), GlobalSign maintains
four still valid cross-signs: AlphaSSL CA - SHA256 - G2, GlobalSign
Organization Validation CA - SHA256 - G2, GlobalSign Domain Val-
idation CA - SHA256 - G2, and GlobalSign CloudSSL CA - SHA256
- G3. The two cross-signing roots GlobalSign Root CA and Global-
Sign provide broad trust coverage everyone for itself; hence the
cross-signs establish alternative paths.
B.3.3 Comodo’s Trust-Enlarging and Fall-Back Cross-Signs. Co-
modo extensively uses cross-signing to interlink root certificates
within and between its subsidiary CAs as we visualize in Figure 4.
Still, this interlinking is established by only a few certificates which
cross-sign several others. Especially the broadly trusted AddTrust
External CA Root cross-signed various root certificates of USERTrust
and Comodo, establishing fall-back trust paths for them. Almost
all these cross-signs also enlarge the root store coverage, compen-
sating for a limited root store coverage of the cross-signed root.
This effect is especially large for USERTRUST UTN-USERFirst-Client
Authentication and USERTrust UTN-USERFirst-Object as it adds trust
paths for Mozilla, Android, and the grid PKI beyond the original
coverage of only iOS, OSX, and Microsoft. Contrarily, COMODO
ECC Certification Authority and COMODO RSA Certification Au-
thority merely obtain new trust by the grid PKI. Nevertheless, they
still profit from the fall-back trust paths. Before USERTrust UTN-
USERFirst-Hardware and USERTrust UTN - DATACorp SGC ceased
their operation, their mutual cross-signs with AddTrust External CA
Root also provided the latter with fall-back trust paths — which nat-
urally expanded to all its cross-signs. Similarly, the broadly trusted
AAA Certificate Services root10 cross-signed three USERTrust roots
providing each with a further fall-back trust path.
Also Comodo’s intermediate XS-Certs COMODO EV SSL CA and
COMODO EV SGC CA profit from fall-back trust paths established
through cross-signing. Comodo’s very first intermediate XS-Cert,
however, is LiteSSL CA which Comodo created for Positive Software
Corporation after acquiring it in 2005.
B.4 Switching Trust Anchor
The expiry of or changing trust in certificates requires CAs to
establish new trust paths to keep affected but still trustworthy
certificates valid. For example, if the issuing certificate will soon
expire, the owner of an intermediate may request a different CA
to issue a longer lasting intermediate with the same subject and
public key. Remember that we require certificates of a cross-sign to
overlap by at least 121 days (cf. Section 3.1) and otherwise consider
it as re-issuance. However, some trust changes happen years before
expiry of the original certificates:
Symantec’s GeoTrust Global CA issued an intermediate for Uni-
Credit in 2012 and renewed it in 2015. In October 2016, Actalis
cross-signed this certificate. However, the older GeoTrust issued
certs were revoked the day after this issuance, rendering this to a
switch to a new root rather than a typical cross-sign.
Similarly, The Spanish Autoridad de Certificacion Firmaprofe-
sional CIF A62634068 moved from a soon expiring to a more recent
root.
Also Sertifitseerimiskeskus (SK), which is the partner of Estonia
for id products, used cross-signing to switch its AS Sertifitseerim-
iskeskus root (expiring in 2016) to the new EE Certification Centre
10 The subject AAA Certificate Services is used for a root certificate but also for an
unrelated intermediate XS-Cert, i.e., the latter uses a different private key.

Root CA. Interestingly, the cross-sign does include a SHA3 inter-
mediate since 2015 but no cross-sign with SHA2, limiting clients
without SHA3 capabilities to the use of a SHA1 trust path element.
B.5 Ownership Changes: Further Examples
and Digicert Details
In Section 5.6, we showed that cross-signs frequently outlive owner-
ship changes which may lead missing awareness of the cross-signs
and overseen problems. We provide further examples and a detailed
view on the Digicert cases in the following.
B.5.1 Entrust Datacard. Entrust Datacard is another example with
cross-signs that span an ownership change: In 2016, Entrust Dat-
acard obtained control of Affirmtrust Networking and Affirmtrust
Commercial which were cross-signed by SwissSign Gold CA - G2
