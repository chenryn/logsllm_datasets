User: Through an application I have made with Tkinter, I'm trying to add a command to run a script every week. When the program is closed the command should be in forever place. 
I've sifted through the documentation on cron, but there doesn't seem to be a way to edit the crontab without using the shell. Also I've looked through the 'at' command, but that only seems to run once.
My question is - How can one create a weekly recurring task by issuing a single command in Python on Unix?
If not with only 1 command, can I use multiple?
Assistant: In most modern Linux distros like Debian or Ubuntu, you can add an executable file (like a shell script or a symlink to one) into /etc/cron.weekly and it will be automatically run once a week for you. This is using the anacron command, which is fairly common these days.
