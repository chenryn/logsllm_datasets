### Device Behavior and Account Analysis

#### Snapshot Reporting
Most devices report at least 100 snapshots per day.

#### Account Registration Comparison
**Figure 5: Comparison of the Number and Types of Accounts Registered on Devices Controlled by ASO Workers and Regular Participants**

- **Gmail Accounts**: Worker devices tend to have more Gmail accounts but fewer types of non-Gmail accounts compared to regular devices.
- **Account Diversity**: Regular users typically have a greater variety of account types, including non-Gmail accounts.

**Impact on Review Posting**
The number of accounts registered on a device affects the number of reviews that can be posted. 

**Gmail Accounts Registered**
- **Regular Users (145 devices)**: 
  - Maximum: 10 accounts
  - Average: 2 accounts
  - Standard Deviation: 1.66
- **Worker Devices (390 devices)**:
  - Maximum: 163 accounts
  - Average: 28.87 accounts
  - Standard Deviation: 29.37
  - 13 worker devices have more than 100 Gmail accounts.

**Statistical Analysis**
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test** and **ANOVA** (parametric and non-parametric) found statistically significant differences between workers and regular users (p-value < 0.05).

#### Different Account Types
**Figure 5 (center)**
- **Regular Devices**: Have a higher diversity of account types, including social networks like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram.
- **Worker Devices**: Primarily use Google services and other tools useful for ASO work, such as Dualspace.daemon and freelancer apps.

**Statistical Analysis**
- Both KS and ANOVA analyses revealed significant differences in the number of non-Gmail accounts (p-value < 0.05).

#### Follow-Up with Participants
- **ASO Workers**: Six workers claimed to personally own only 1-4 Google accounts, while four others controlled 10 to 50 Gmail accounts, and one claimed to have "many accounts."

### Summary of Findings
- **Account Registration**: ASO workers register significantly more accounts on their devices, particularly Gmail accounts, but have less diversity in the types of accounts.
- **Specialization**: Their accounts are specialized for ASO work, focusing on Gmail and tools like Dualspace to enable multiple installations and reviews of the same app.

### Installed Apps

**Hypothesis**
We investigate whether workers and regular users differ in their interaction with installed apps.

**Apps Installed and Reviewed**
**Figure 6**
- **Installed Apps**:
  - **Regular Devices**: Average of 65.45 apps
  - **Worker Devices**: Average of 77.56 apps
- **Reviewed Apps**:
  - **Regular Devices**: Average of 0.7 apps
  - **Worker Devices**: Average of 40.51 apps
- **Total Reviews**:
  - **Regular Devices**: Average of 1.91 reviews
  - **Worker Devices**: Average of 208.91 reviews
  - 11 worker-controlled devices each responsible for more than 1,000 total reviews.

**Statistical Analysis**
- **KS Test**: Significant differences in the distributions (p-value = 0.008)
- **ANOVA**: No statistically significant difference (p-value = 0.301)

### Install-to-Review Time

**Android API Data**
- **Time Between Installation and Review**:
  - **Regular Users**: Average waiting time of 85.09 days (M = 21.92 days, SD = 140.56 days)
  - **Workers**: Average waiting time of 10.4 days (M = 5.00 days, SD = 13.72 days)
  - 13,376 out of 40,397 reviews from worker devices were posted within one day of installation.

**Statistical Analysis**
- Both ANOVA and KS tests found statistically significant differences (p-value < 0.05).

### Stopped Apps

**Figure 8: Boxplot of Stopped Apps for Regular and Worker Devices**
- **Worker Devices**: Tend to have more stopped apps, likely due to not opening the apps they install or stopping misbehaving apps.
- **Regular Devices**: Fewer stopped apps, indicating more frequent use.

**Follow-Up with Participants**
- **Reasons for Stopping Apps**:
  - Some workers do not open the apps they install.
  - Others stop apps that misbehave or due to limited storage.

### Third-Party App Stores

- **Third-Party Apps**: Some participant devices had apps not available in Google Play.
- **Reasons for Using Third-Party Stores**:
  - To play games or avoid subscription fees by using modded apps.
  - Example: Modded versions of Netflix and Hotstar for free premium access.

### App Churn: Install and Uninstall Events

**Figure 9: Scatterplot of Average Number of Daily Installs vs. Uninstalls**
- **Daily Installs**:
  - **Worker Devices**: Average of 15.94 daily installs (M = 6.41, SD = 27.37)
  - **Regular Devices**: Average of 3.88 daily installs (M = 2.0, SD = 7.29)
- **Daily Uninstalls**:
  - **Worker Devices**: Average of 7.02 daily uninstalls (M = 2.73, SD = 15.69)
  - **Regular Devices**: Average of 3.29 daily uninstalls (M = 1.8, SD = 6.87)

**Statistical Analysis**
- **KS Test and ANOVA**: Statistically significant differences (p-value < 0.05).

### Number of Apps Used Per Day

**Figure 10: Scatterplot of Apps Used Per Day vs. Installed Apps**
- **Overlap**: Substantial overlap between regular and worker devices, suggesting that the daily number of used apps is not a reliable differentiator.

### App Permissions

**Figure 11: Comparison of Exclusive App Permissions**
- **Dangerous Permissions**: Some worker devices host apps with the highest number of dangerous permissions, but most apps share similar permission profiles across all device types.

**Follow-Up with Participants**
- **Granting Permissions**:
  - Five workers grant all requested permissions.
  - One worker grants permissions selectively based on client requests.
  - Two regular participants avoid granting location and personal data permissions.

### Malware and Attitudes

**Figure 12: Comparison of Malware Occurrence**
- **Malware Presence**: Worker devices host more unique malware, which tends to be present on more devices than for regular users.

**VirusTotal Analysis**
- **Data Collection**: 18,079 distinct hashes corresponding to 9,911 unique mobile app identifiers.
- **Availability in VirusTotal**: 12,431 hashes were available.
- **Malware Detection**: 62 detection engines used to process APK files.

**Summary of Findings**
- **App Interaction**: Workers post reviews for a significantly higher number of installed apps and wait shorter times to post reviews.
- **App Management**: Workers install more apps per day and have more stopped apps, likely due to retention requirements.
- **Malware**: Worker devices host more unique malware, indicating potential security risks.
