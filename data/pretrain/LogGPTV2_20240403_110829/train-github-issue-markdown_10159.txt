# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
If you decide to not use the "Relaunch as administrator" when administrative
privileges are needed but instead ~~need~~ decide to use the alternative
method "Always run as administrator", you need to click yes on every system
boot up to grant permissions for powertoys admin privileges. On every single
Windows boot up.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Is it technically possible to create a kind of silent mode for granting the
admin privileges? A kind of one-time approval to start with admin privileges
from now on, so that there isn't an admin prompt on every boot?
