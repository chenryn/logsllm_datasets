from limited vantage points, selectively probing preﬁxes, IP-
to-AS mapping issues [15, 16], and can not discover backup
links [20]. Finally, many of the ASes, except in the RIPE
region, do not actively use the IRR to register their routing
policy related information [17,36]. Thus, topology collection
from LG servers result in discovering otherwise unobserved
part of the Internet as LG servers provide new BGP feeders
from geographically diverse locations in the Internet. Note
that new AS links found in the AS topology from the LG
servers can be hidden from other router collectors due to
traﬃc engineering practices (such as route aggregation) of
ASes in BGP [7, 10].
5.2 Overlapping/Unique ASes
Table 6 shows the number of common ASes for each pair of
the datasets. The diagonal zone from upper-left to bottom-
right (in bold) reports the count of ASes appearing in only
one dataset. We observe 686 unique ASes from LG servers
while IRL has only 181 unique ASes. There are around 6.2 K
unique ASes in the IRR; mostly from RIPE and APNIC re-
gions suggesting the popularity of the IRR usage in these
regions [17]. We do not ﬁnd any unique ASes in Ark, which
suggests their accurate use of the BGP traces since Ark relies
on BGP traces from RouteViews to convert IP-to-AS paths
collected from traceroute measurements. Finally,
iPlane
shows 281 unique ASes. On further investigation, we ﬁnd
that these ASes were not operational in BGP in the month of
March 2013. For example, (i) AS1448 (DPEC Partners) had
been visible until February 18, 2013, (ii) AS40027 (Netﬂix)

had been visible until February 23, 2012, and (iii) AS42411
(Vereya) had been visible until March 16, 2012, but not
any more. The reason why we observed 281 unique ASes in
iPlane is because it uses BGP traces that contain older data
collected from July 2006 to March 2013 during the IP to AS
mapping process, constructing its AS topology.
We check the RIR wise distribution of these 686 new ASes
found from the LG servers, and ﬁnd that 548 ASes are oper-
ational in ARIN, 71 in RIPE, 31 in APNIC, 28 in LACNIC,
and 8 in AfriNIC. Most of the ASes are from the ARIN
region, possibly due to the lower popularity of the IRR reg-
istration practice in that region, compared with the RIPE
and APNIC ones [17]. We also check the length of IP pre-
ﬁxes announced by the new 686 ASes to ﬁnd that 90% of
the ASes announce IP preﬁxes of length between /19 and
/24, which suggests that these IP preﬁxes are possibly ag-
gregated by their provider ASes. Thus, the practice of IP
preﬁx aggregation in BGP is one of the possible reasons that
many of the new ASes observed from the LG servers are hid-
den from RouteViews, RIPE-RIS, and PCH BGP collectors.
Yet, we observe that the practice of IP preﬁx aggregation in
BGP may not be the only reason for these 686 hidden ASes
since we also observe a few IP preﬁxes of length between /16
and /18, which needs further study.
Finally, we check the provider degree (i.e., the number of
provider ASes of an AS) of each of the 686 ASes, and ﬁnd
that 98% of the ASes have only one provider AS. That is, an
AS with a small provider degree is more likely to be hidden
behind their provider ASes [7, 9]. Still, there are some ASes
with their provider degrees ranging between 2 and 10. For
instance, AS410 (754th Electronic Systems Group) has 10
provider ASes. To further investigate 686 hidden ASes, we
queried two popular WHOIS services: Team Cymru and
Hurricane Electric’s WHOIS service [38]. These WHOIS
services reportedly have access to the BGP feeds of ASes
that are not the BGP feeders of RouteViews and RIPE-
RIS [10]. Thus, they can provide some more insights related
to the operation of these hidden ASes. While the WHOIS
records conﬁrm the operation of 150 (out of 686) ASes found
from the LG servers, most of the ASes do not have their
details in the WHOIS services either.
5.3 AS Degree Distribution
In this section, we investigate whether the diﬀerent meth-
ods of collecting AS topologies result in diﬀerent AS degree
distributions. The AS degree distribution is the prob-
ability that a randomly selected AS is k-degree: P (k) =
n(k)/n; where n is the number of ASes and n(k) is the
number of ASes with degree k. The degree distribution is
the most frequently used topology characteristic [5].

(b) LG and IRR
(c) LG and Traceroute-based
Figure 1: AS degree distribution (CCDF) of the AS topology obtained from the LG server dataset, as compared to those of
other datasets.
Figure 1 shows the CCDFs of the AS topology datasets
plotted along with that of the LG server-derived AS topol-
ogy. Figure 1(a) shows that IRL provides more connectivity
information related to moderate degree ASes than the LG
servers.
Figure 1(b) shows that IRR has many more AS links for
the moderate degree ASes which implies that the IRR is pop-
ular in the realm of smaller ISPs. Large ISPs have shown
little interest in the IRR as it is diﬃcult to manage complex
routing policies in the IRR [36]. Figure 1(c) shows that LG
servers and iPlane closely match for the low degree ASes.
However, iPlane reports more AS links for higher degree
ASes. To ﬁnd out the reasons, we analyze the traceroute
IP paths collected from the iPlane in March 2013. We ob-
serve that iPlane has a selective list of IP preﬁxes (120 K
out of approximately 450 K IP preﬁxes that are currently
operational in BGP [35]) to probe the Internet and this list
seems to concentrate more on probing the core Internet [20].
Thus, iPlane discovers more connectivity of higher degree
ASes. Finally, Ark reports more connectivity of the mod-
erate degree ASes than the LG severs and iPlane. Overall,
traceroute based projects such as Ark and iPlane suﬀer from
limited vantage points, selectively probing IP preﬁxes, errors
in the translation from IP to AS Path. Such factors impact
the AS topology view observed from traceroute measure-
ments, which can also be error prone [15, 16].
6. RELATED WORK
There have been a number of measurement studies related
to the AS topology discovery [2,7–9,14,18,19]. To quote the
most recent eﬀorts, He et al. [9] provide a large scale com-
prehensive synthesis of the available routing data sources
such as BGP routing tables, IRR, and traceroute data. Au-
gustin et al. [2] build on the work of He et al. [9], but the
focus is on the IXP substrate, not on the AS topology as
a whole. Active measurement platforms such as Ark [19],
DIMES [14], and iPlane [20] are providing the AS topology
views, but suﬀer from the small number of vantage points to
run traceroute measurements. To overcome the limitation,
Chen et al. [10] propose to send traceroute probes from a
large number of (992,000 P2P user IPs in 3,700 ASes) P2P
clients.
So far, LG servers have been considered as a secondary
source of inter-domain routing data for discovering links in
the Internet topology [2, 7, 9, 18]. That is, LG servers have
been used to augment some AS links to the AS topology
extracted from BGP traces [7], or used to help verify the
AS links found in the IRR [9]. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this paper is the ﬁrst to show that LG servers are yet
another non-negligible source for building Internet AS topol-
ogy. Moreover, collecting BGP traces from the LG servers
can help widen the narrow view of BGP observed from the
current BGP collector projects, such as RouteViews, RIPE-
RIS, and PCH [22].
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we highlight the less-known capabilities of
Looking glass (LG) servers to construct Internet AS topol-
ogy. By collecting show ip bgp summary command re-
sponses from 245 LG servers (from 1.9 K locations in 110
countries) and BGP neighbor ip advertised routes com-
mand responses from 59 LG servers (from 250 locations in
40 countries) in March 2013, we build an AS topology esti-
mate of around 116 K AS links. We newly discovered 11 K
AS links and 686 ASes that are not found in BGP, tracer-
oute, and IRR based AS topologies. Clearly, LG servers
help in augmenting the current AS topology collection ef-
forts reliably as BGP based methods are less error prone as
compared to traceroute-based ones. However, the AS topol-
ogy view from the LG servers suﬀers from limited vantage
points of the LG servers and BGP export policies employed
by the neighboring ASes of LG servers. Overall, we envi-
sion that more LG servers are deployed in the Internet in
the future as they are important operational tools deployed
by ASes. Thus, the research community needs to be aware
of the facilities provided by them to discover Internet AS
topology.
