# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I was wondering if the "single-key/multi-use" functionality of dual-key-remap
might be something that would complement the Keyboard Manager.
The canonical usage example is to allow the `Capslock` key to be re-mapped to
`Escape` when pressed, but `Ctrl` when held in combination with other keys
(e.g. `Capslock + s` equals `Save`). With this type of mapping, the `Capslock`
still functions as `Escape` if it is pressed/released as the last key in a
combination. For example, assuming `Ctrl` is still also bound to `Ctrl`, the
combination `Ctrl + Shift + Capslock` will open the Windows Task Manager.
I've been using it extensively for a couple of months and it has functioned
flawlessly for me, without any gotchas.
I suspect it's not "mission-critical", but I've found it to be surprisingly
helpful, with a lot of potential uses.
