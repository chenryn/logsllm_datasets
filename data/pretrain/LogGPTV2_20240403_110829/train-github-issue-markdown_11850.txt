Recently, Javier posted a blog post about supporting « notes » in XLIFF files.
As notes are written directly in the XLIFF files by translators for instance,
this means the technical guys in charge of the application will have to be
warned for notes and open the files.
I was wondering if we could enhance the `translation:debug` command to be able
to print the details of one single translation at a time like we already do
for routes and services. We could then display the following information for a
unique translation : source language, target language, source string, target
string, notes (if any) and the list of all catalogues file paths where the
translation is set or overriden.
In projects, it happens many time that we have to search for the location of a
single translation using a grep or ack command. This is quite painful and time
consuming. I can't tell how painful it should be for Windows users too. The
other problem is when we have to search for translations located in YAML
files. Indeed, YAML translation files contain translations defined like this :
    # app/Resources/translations/messages.fr.yml
    homepage:
        jumbotron:
            title: Bienvenue chez nous!
This means the translation can then be used with the key
`homepage.jumbotron.title`. If you want to search for this translation key
using grep/ack or whatever tool, you won't be able to find any results as the
search key doesn't match any translation keys in the YAML catalogue.
That's why I think enhancing the `translation:debug` command may add value for
developers / technical project managers.
How can we achieve that?
In my opinion, we could generate an aggregated XML or JSON file in the cache
directory that contains all translations' metadata. In dev environment we
don't want to regenerate it at each single request so we could do that only
when we use the `translation:debug` command.
Would you think this enhancement would add value to your projects?
