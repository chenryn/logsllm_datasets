• Protocols  
• Protocol type – routable or non-routable 
• Site 
• System 
• Classification – discussed later 
The device list should include PLC, DCS, Serial or Network Recorders, Computers 
and Servers, KVM switches, media converters, external drives, controllers, thin clients, 
network switches, routers, hubs, any device with an Ethernet connection and any other 
device the site feels should be included.

One series of network drawings must be developed and maintained using highly 
confidential methods. It must include every connection using routable and digital protocol 
to every cyber device; however the site chooses to define the term cyber device. Refer to 
Section  7. Appendix A: Examples. Connections usually included are Ethernet, serial, fiber, 
USB, proprietary protocols, wireless, printer and others. Devices usually include PLCs, a 
DCS, process recorders, computers, servers, media converters, external storage, 
controllers, thin clients, Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) switches, Ethernet switches, 
routers, hubs and any device which has an Ethernet connection. Of course, symbology, 
line types, borders, etc must be defined prior to embarking on this development.  
4.3.3. Procedure 1: Policies 
This procedure should be considered the master document, identifying associated 
procedures and requirements that are common to all cyber security procedures. This 
master document should include: 
• An overview of scope, approach and commitment to cyber security 
• Cyber security team including roles,  responsibilities and contact data 
• Accountability of employees statement 
• References: governing standards, guidance  
• Issuance and update policies for procedures 
• Processes for initiating, documenting and closing exceptions to policies: 
documented exceptions should always require compensating measures to mitigate 
any added risk 
• Exception review policies: exceptions, conditions for exceptions and the exceptions 
process 
• Identification, Classification and Categorization policies and processes 
• Personnel security training requirements, processes and policies 
• Introductions/overview of associated procedures 
• Periodic reviews of all policies 
Applying contiguous security management controls across an organization proves to be 
more cost effective in the near and long terms than attempting to apply two or more sets of 
controls to sub entities. 
4.3.4. Procedure 2: Information Protection 
It is essential that only individuals with a need to know are allowed to view sensitive 
information, regardless of the media type. This procedure should provide the process to 
ensure this happens. 
4.3.4.1.   Information management controls- How to deal with large quantities of 
information, most of which may be considered sensitive information. 
Industrial Cyber Security: From the Perspective of the Power Sector                                Page 19 of 65 
July 28th 2010 
Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
• Policies, process and reporting requirements for information loss or theft 
• Data retention requirements: everything should be kept, electronically, 
indefinitely and well organized 
• Policies for determining the sensitive nature of information and subsequent 
controls through assessments 
• Individuals responsible for access authorization. 
4.3.4.2.   Information access controls - How to access sensitive information and 
maintain an accurate record of information owners and what they own. 
• User management policies: Information access control list and policies for 
adding, removing and modifying users/user rights 
• Authorization process for access rights 
• Personnel risk assessments/background checks  
4.3.4.3.   Sensitive/Top Secret Information - Whatever policies an organization has in 
place regarding classifying information, sensitive/top secret information should include 
the following at a minimum. 
• Operational procedures and lists 
• Network topology and similar, floor plans of computing centers, equipment 
layouts 
• Disaster recovery/incident response plans 
• Security configuration information 
Information must be protected from start to finish, from initial plant design to plant 
shutdown and abandonment. Once information about the network is leaked, the only 
effective mitigation is to redesign the network or perhaps augment certain security 
controls. 
4.3.5. Procedure 3: Physical Security Plan 
This procedure should define the physical access controls, monitoring and user 
management policies of the organization; it defines requirements for the first and last lines 
of defense against local cyber attacks and local brute force physical destruction of 
systems. 
4.3.5.1.   Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs) -  segmenting and layering physical 
security and identification of physical access points. 
• PSP design requirements: a layered approach is highly recommended by 
making use of primary, secondary and tertiary ESPs. 
Industrial Cyber Security: From the Perspective of the Power Sector                                Page 20 of 65 
July 28th 2010 
Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
• Requirements for protection of physical access points to PSPs: two factor 
authentication at each PSP access point, whether primary, secondary or tertiary, 
is recommended. 
4.3.5.2.   Physical Security Controls – protection of PSP access points and devices 
used for the monitoring and control of physical access points. 
• Policies and tools to monitor, log and alert attempts at unauthorized physical 
access and breaches at all access points to PSPs and critical areas at all times 
• Incident Response Plan for physical security breaches and reporting 
requirements 
• Physical enclosures (6 walled devices) with physical access warnings (e.g. 
“Authorized Personnel Only”) 
• Acceptable physical security controls: Keys/Locks, RFID readers, iris, fingerprint 
or other biometric systems, cameras, etc 
4.3.5.3.   Physical Access Controls – user management and auditing 
• User management policies: Physical access control list and policies for adding, 
removing and modifying users/user rights 
• Levels of physical access including restricted, escorted, unescorted, visitor or 
unrestricted and conditions for membership: use a scaled value to define what 
the user is allowed to do once granted access. A need to know approach should 
be taken 
• Policies and tools to monitor and log authorized physical access: a historical 
audit trail should be kept indefinitely. 
• Pass, ID, keys and locks management and response to loss or tampering  
This procedure will inherently be tied closely to Procedure 5, Change Control and 
Configuration Management.  Anytime there is a change to the physical security of cyber 
assets, requirements in both procedures will need to be met. 
4.3.6. Procedure 4: Electronic Security Plan 
This procedure should define the electronic access controls, monitoring and user 
management policies of the organization; it defines requirements for the first and last 
lines of defense against remote and local cyber attacks. 
4.3.6.1. Electronic Security Perimeters (ESPs) – segmenting and layering electronic 
security and identification of electronic access points. 
• ESP design requirements: a layered approach is highly recommended by 
making use of primary, secondary and tertiary ESPs. A Demilitarized Zone 
should be used to isolate the Primary ESP from untrusted networks

July 28th 2010 
Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
• Requirements for protection of electronic access points to ESPs: two factor 
authentication at each ESP access point, whether primary, secondary or tertiary, 
is recommended 
4.3.6.2.   Electronic Security Controls – protection of ESP access points and individual 
cyber devices. 
• Policies and tools to monitor, log and alert attempts at unauthorized electronic 
access and actual breaches at all access points to ESPs as well as devices at all 
times 
• Incident Response Plan for electronic security breaches and reporting 
requirements 
• Network security controls: encryption and authentication policies, 
password/username policies, protection of interfaces between internal and 
external networks, firewalls, network and device design requirements, network 
backup and recovery infrastructure, security assessments 
• Device security controls: security settings, hardening plan, software verification 
and code reviews, firewall use and policies, digital media policies 
• Backup and recovery: define process for backup generation, validation and 
recovery and requirements for media and backup systems 
4.3.6.3.   Electronic Access Controls – user management and auditing 
• User management policies: Electronic access control list and policies for adding, 
removing and modifying users/user rights 
• Levels of electronic access (user rights) including admin or other user groups 
and conditions for membership 
• Policies and tools to monitor and log authorized electronic access: a historical 
audit trail should be kept indefinitely 
• Personnel, domain, login and fair use banner policies 
This procedure will inherently be tied closely to Procedure 5, Change Control and 
Configuration Management.  Anytime there is a change to the electronic security of 
cyber assets, requirements in both procedures will need to be met. 
4.3.7. Procedure 5: Change Control and Configuration Management 
It is extremely important that semi-automated management systems be in place prior 
to any attempt to keep track of configuration data. Previous attempts at manual survey 
and walk downs have not proven to be cost effective compared to automated systems. 
Even with use of automated scripts to capture data and databases to store data, the 
costs associated with these reoccurring activities far exceeds those to install new 
automated analogs. This procedure should include the following main points.

4.3.7.1.   Asset management - changes in network design and how devices are tracked 
and managed on a network 
• All changes to the network must be tracked on lists, drawings, databases and 
anywhere else “current” data exists 
• Defines roles and responsibilities for authorization of changes 
• Defines policies for new devices or disposal/relocation of hardware 
4.3.7.2.   Configuration management – changes to device software or hardware design 
• All configuration and logic changes to cyber devices must be tracked indefinitely 
via Operations & Maintenance (O&M) activities: most of the power sector 
currently tracks at least the most critical or hard to replace logic on cyber 
devices, others effectively track all logic. 
• Policies regarding where and how configuration data is tracked, protected and 
stored: systematically and electronically manage data to improve security in a 
cost effective way. 
• Define what configuration data is required and recommended: all configuration 
data is useful under certain scenarios. Always know all open ports, installed 
programs and services, security setting configurations, hardware configurations 
and other pertinent data. 
• Defines process for hardware upgrades, software changes and version upgrades 
of operating systems, logic/graphics changes, firmware updates, vendor 
releases, implementation of security patches and cumulative service packs 
• Patch management, testing and rollout: operating systems, network devices and 
control system components 
• Define what devices require configuration management: Typically not necessary 
for devices like process transmitters, though calibration instructions should be on 
file and available for immediate recalibration. At a minimum, distributed the DCS,  
PLCs, human machine interfaces, PCs/servers, switches, routers, hubs and all 
devices with an Ethernet, serial, modem or USB port should be included. 
4.3.7.3.   Change Process – change requests, implementation and testing 
• Changes may result from vulnerability identification, patch releases, a need for 
added/reduced functionality, or many other scenarios. 
• A plan should be in place for implementing and testing changes prior to any 
change occurring. Changes should be tested in-lab prior to implementation in-
field and after implementation in-field. 
• Process for initiating reviewing, approving, authorizing, implementing and testing 
changes: Plan reviews should be approved by authorized personnel to ensure 
there are no adverse consequences to security. Sufficient backups should be 
maintained in case a rollback is required.

Configurations need to be periodically (at least daily) validated to ensure they have not 
been changed inadvertently or without authorization. This would be completely 
impractical using manual time intensive methods, automation must be used. 
4.3.8. Design Guides 
Design guides should not list hard requirements, rather guidelines for effective 
implementation of security systems based on lessons learned throughout the industry 
and general best practices. They should be written when a particular need is identified. 
4.4.  Recommendations for a True Defense-in-depth Approach 
Section  4.3 deals entirely with documentation, records and the audit trail. This section is 
intended to provide an in-depth and comprehensive rundown of the recommended 
methods, techniques and tools for complying with the policies outlined in the previous 
section. The methods outlined in this section were developed over the course of a year with 
particular attention paid to ensuring compliance with the standards previously discussed. 
When appropriate, new processes should be rolled into existing processes such as the 
sites Corrective Action Program (CAP) which usually gives requirements for identifying, 
reporting, evaluating and correcting problems with the plant in general. 
4.4.1. Identification, Classification  and Categorization 
Existing documentation such as connection diagrams and network diagrams could be 
incomplete and/or inaccurate depending on how well the organization developed and 
maintained documentation in the past. Any existing documentation must be field verified 
prior to use in a new compliance effort. It is assumed the organization has already 
developed a network diagram and sites, systems and a device list.  
Sites should be classified by importance to operations and risk of long term 
widespread impact to other facilities (i.e. severity of an attack). Systems should be 
classified by importance to plant operation and worst case scenario down time or time to 
restart (i.e. severity of attack) and likeliness of attack. Devices should be classified 
based on importance to operation and control (i.e. severity of attack), likeliness of attack 
and ease of attack. 
Classification of all items on the sites list should be completed prior to classification of 
items on the system or device list. Items on the systems list will inherit some 
requirements from the sites list and devices will inherit some requirements from the 
systems list. The results of this classification process should be used to determine what 
sites, systems and devices should be addressed first and which sites, systems and 
devices should be protected the most. This will help determine yearly funding needs. 
The process should be kept as simple and intuitive as possible yet remain effective.

As of 2010, most governing authorities do not specifically call out the methods and 
classification titles of sites, systems or devices. It is therefore left up to the organizations 
to develop a scheme. The following provides a recommended scheme for classifying 
items on the sites, systems and devices lists. This should be tailored to the organization, 
but it is not recommended that the organization curtail any of the requirements. 
Classifications are numbered based on level of importance in ascending order with 1 
implying the most essential and important classification, this will assist in quickly 
interpreting and disseminating the knowledge concerning the severity of an immediate 
attack regardless whether the attack is against a site, system or device. 
4.4.1.1.   Sites  
Examples of sites may include generating stations, control centers, backup control 
centers, large transmission substations, facilities critical to system restoration, 
automatic load shedding, and special protection systems.14
Scheme: 
Q0 - severity of attack: Does an asset if destroyed, degraded, compromised or 
otherwise rendered unavailable, impact the reliability of the Bulk Electric System?  
Can adverse consequences of a cyber attack at the target site spread far beyond 
the target site? 
Level of 
Importance 
Q0 
Classification 
Implications 
2 
No 
Non-Critical 
Site 
Well protected site, 
eventually. 
1 
Yes Critical Site 
Highly protected site and 
addressed first. 
Usually, factors to consider when answering Q0 should include peak load 
generation, availability (how long process restoration will take in a worst case cyber 
attack scenario) and integrity (how resistant the site is to compromise and permanent 
damage to systems). Precise methodology to determine the critical nature of a site has 
not been given by most governing authorities, probably because the authorities simply 
have not identified the most effective methods yet due to the relative newness of this 
field. See Appendix A: Examples. 
4.4.1.2.   Systems 
Systems vary greatly from site to site; each site usually has a pre-developed 
systems list. Examples of common systems at a coal plant are Boiler, Turbine Control, 
14 North American Electric Reliability Corporation, NERC. CIP-002-3: Critical Infrastructure Protection. Washington, DC : 
NERC, 2009.

Burner Management, and many more. Examples of common systems at nuclear plants 
include Reactor Control, Fuel Loading, Turbine Control, and many more. 
Scheme: 
Q1 - likeliness of attack: Does the system include cyber devices? 
Q2 - severity of attack: Does the system directly support the reliable operation of the
