# Time When Nanoseconds Count: Security in Low-Latency Trading

## Variations from Common Practices

To meet the requirements of low-latency and deterministic performance, several critical deviations from standard practices must be implemented. In most installations, traditional perimeter defense mechanisms are entirely absent. You will not find firewalls, routers with Access Control Lists (ACLs), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), or any other recognizable security tools.

The primary reason for the absence of these security devices is that even the best offerings from the IT security industry fall short. Most commercial firewalls add a few milliseconds of latency, which is negligible in most interconnection scenarios but is approximately 100,000 times too slow for low-latency trading.

Additionally, many products do not support this mode of operation, and there is a significant skills gap among IT security professionals. The majority of IT security workers in large organizations that utilize low-latency trading lack the necessary background to implement basic network security while also securing custom systems.

## Threat Models

Training staff with the skills needed for network security, as well as the insight to identify and communicate flaws in custom FPGA-based network interface hardware, is not a simple task. As a result, most installations forgo security and rely on market-data providers and exchanges' commitments to network security, often without a full understanding of potential threats.

Developing an appropriate trust model should be straightforward, given the known absence of controls. However, determining the real issues and the most appropriate responses is more challenging. Here are the three largest threats to consider:

1. **The Developers**: In algorithmic trading, developers are often traders or their subordinates who have live access to the production algo engine and can make on-the-fly changes. This setup lacks the usual Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) controls.

2. **The Insider**: This threat involves a trader or administrator of low-latency systems who uses their access to market data networks or exchange networks to cause negative effects for other participants.

3. **The Market Itself**: This is a unique technical threat. As the other party in a communication, could the market itself cause issues with your systems? Consider the impact of malformed messages or compromised systems of other participants.

When building a threat model, it is essential to consider that even unusual cases might become common. At the speed of transaction flow, prevention may be impractical, so the model should focus on post-fact detective controls.

## Beginning the Solution

"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." â€” Lao-tzu

For low-latency or algorithmic trading systems, any improvement in security would be a positive change. Due to the need for speed, some techniques from the late 1990s, such as bastion hosts, router ACLs, and layer 3 and 4 firewall rules, are still relevant, provided you use sufficiently fast equipment. Top-of-rack switches now offer sub-microsecond performance for cut-through layer 4 switching.

Even if no changes can be implemented, having a complete architectural understanding of the systems as they are currently deployed would improve the security posture. Situational awareness is crucial.

### Recommendations for Stakeholders

- **Product Vendors**: It's time to pay attention to this market. There is demand for more than just checkbox protection.
- **Risk/Process/Policy/GRC**: Work with the business. They understand risk better than you might, but have different tolerances. Use their knowledge to make informed decisions rather than following dogmatic statements.
- **IT Compliance**: Engage with financial compliance teams. There is much to discuss.
- **Practitioners in the Trenches**: Research everything. Be prepared to operate at all levels simultaneously with reaction times that match your low-latency business partners. Conduct proof-of-concept tests to identify where you can and cannot help. Prepare for the ongoing pressure to reduce transaction times.
