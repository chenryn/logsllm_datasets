indicators). The integration works in the same way for models representing the same
organizational aspect, but different levels of abstraction (e.g. process models from
different levels of processes hierarchy). It is important to consider that knowledge
elements of different models often overlap. Therefore, additional merging rules,
which are not part of the ontology have to be defined. Depending on the usage of the
knowledge base, the extraction and backward mapping into the specific model
structure format is needed. Because of the transformation from semantic richer model
(relations or properties which specific models not support) into specific format, for
such a step a special consideration is required.
4 Overall System Architecture and Applied Technologies
The system architecture for the implementation of the integration framework
comprises the following basic parts (Figure 2): (a) business process knowledge
ontology, (b) mapping files repository, (c) mapping and integration component, (d)
extraction and mapping component.

Business process knowledge ontology defines the concepts, their properties, and the
relations between them. In the framework implementation it serves different purposes.
It is applied by the mapping & integration component as the guideline for models
integration. Together with schemas files, which describe the format structure of the
models, is used for the definition of mapping files.
The mapping files repository consists of a collection of files in XSLT standard format
(W3C 1999). They define the linking between of in particular model covered concepts
and the concepts and properties defined in the BPK ontology. The mapping files have
to be created separately for each particular model (which can have a standard or a tool
specific format) and for each direction of mapping. The necessary requirement for the
modeling tools is therefore the export of models into a semi-structured data format.
Most of current modeling tools support the export in XML format (W3C 2006),
therefore the framework can support most of the open source and commercial
modeling tools. The mapping files can be created manually with a XSLT editors or
semi-automatic (Cardoso 2007). For semi-automatic creation of the mapping file the
tool specific XML schema (W3C 2004) is required.
With help of mapping files the mapping & integration component transforms the
particular models into RDF/OWL (W3C 2004) format and integrates them into the
knowledge base. For the integration into the knowledge base the relations and
constraints defined in by ontology are applied. Extraction and mapping component
manage the extraction of the model specific concepts from the knowledge base and
map those into a tools specific format.
The prototype tool under development implements the described architectural design.
For that purpose the BPK ontology in OWL Web Ontology Language (W3C 2004)
was created. The iterative approach was applied. In the first phase the initial version
of the ontology was created according to the (Hrastnik, Rollett et al. 2004), based on
business process meta models (e.g.(List and Korherr 2006)) as well as with help of
the existing business process and enterprise ontologies (e.g. ((Jenz 2003), (Uschold,
King et al. 1998)). In a second phase, the business process knowledge ontology was
refined and extended with concepts and properties gained from particular models,
whose mapping is already implemented (e.g. XPDL (WFMC 2005)).
Presently the prototype supports the mapping of specific models which represent the
process functional, organizational, and strategic perspective and provide basic
integration functionality.
5 Framework Adaptability
The proposed integration framework is open to extensions or improvements in several
ways. In case of adding new concepts, concept properties or additional relations
between existing concepts, the BPK ontology can be extended by adding new
elements and by defining their context with creation of the proper relations. If the new
elements can be included in one of the specific models, the corresponding mapping
file has to be updated. Another possibility of re-configuration refers to adding new
specific model, e.g. organizational resources, which in the current BPO are covered
only partially. In that case an appropriate modeling tool has to be selected.
Considering the structure format in which the new models will be exported, the
bidirectional mapping files have to be created (see previous section). If required BPK
ontology have to be upgraded with the missing elements. The same procedure can be
applied if a new modeling tool is introduced.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
Organizations have to deal with heterogeneous, distributed, isolated, misunderstood,
and often inaccessible process knowledge. Current modeling approaches as well as
process modeling languages do not completely fulfill the requirements regarding
business process knowledge management. In this paper we propose an adaptive
framework for business process knowledge integration. The novelty in the work is its
semantic technology support for enabling the mapping and integration of different
organization aspect models into a common knowledge base. The business process
knowledge base created in the proposed way can enable process knowledge analysis
(discovering dependencies and dealing with conflicts), and because of more flexible
and powerful relationships at the same time provide a basis for creation of multiple
perspectives (personalized views) on the model.
Our further work in this respect includes the completion of the current framework
prototype implementation, proposed in this paper, as well as accomplishment of the
industry case studies in the organizations which participate in the research project.
The special research focus will be set on possible solutions regarding rules for
automatic integration.
