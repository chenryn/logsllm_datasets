the cellular path for diﬀerent ﬁle sizes.
4.1.1
Results at a glance
From our observations, in the case of single-path TCP,
AT&T performs the worst when the ﬁle size is small (e.g.,
8 KB). This is because the 4G network has a much larger
minimum RTT, and the ﬁle download time over single-path
WiFi is smaller than 4G’s RTT of 60 ms (see Table 3).
Hence, when the ﬁle sizes are as small as 8 KB, MPTCP
can perform just as well as single-path TCP over WiFi (SP
WiFi), regardless of the number of subﬂows - as most of the
subﬂows are not utilized. Figure 5 presents the fraction of
traﬃc carried by the cellular path in MPTCP connections
over diﬀerent ﬁle sizes. For ﬁle sizes smaller than 64 KB,
4-path MPTCP never utilizes the cellular path to deliver
traﬃc, while 2-path MPTCP occasionally utilizes the cellu-
lar path.
For 4-path MPTCP, since both WiFi subﬂows have RTTs
one half or one third of those of the cellular subﬂows, the two
WiFi subﬂows can quickly complete the download of 64 KB
within 2 RTTs (when no loss occurs), and the ﬁle transaction
completes before the cellular paths are able to contribute.
Given that the WiFi paths exhibit roughly 1.6% loss rates,
in the 64 KB single-path TCP case, when a loss occurs, the
cellular subﬂow of the 2-path MPTCP connection is able to
carry some traﬃc.
When the ﬂow size increases to 512 KB, we observe that
WiFi is no longer the best path. Its download time is slightly
larger than that of single-path TCP over AT&T LTE and
has high variability. Although WiFi is characterized by
small RTTs, it exhibits much larger loss rates compared to
the cellular network, as shown in Table 3. When the down-
load time spans several RTTs and the cellular path is able to
contribute, the fraction of traﬃc carried by the cellular sub-
ﬂow(s) surpasses that of the WiFi ﬂow(s). In Figure 5, we
see a clear trend that the fraction of packets carried by the
cellular ﬂows reaches 50% and starts to dominate the packet
delivery when the ﬁle size is 4MB. Note that by replacing
the WiFi AP with a newer standard, such as 802.11n, the
WiFi loss rates can be reduced because of more advanced
technologies. In separate measurements, the ﬂow loss rate
of 802.11n WiFi home network is reduced but still much
larger than that exhibited by cellular.
461Effect of subﬂow number.
For each ﬁle size, we see a clear trend that 4-path MPTCP
outperforms 2-path MPTCP. This result is more prominent
as the ﬁle size increases. The main reason is that when a
MPTCP connection starts four subﬂows for small ﬁle down-
loads (suppose all the subﬂows are utilized and no loss oc-
curs), all subﬂows can still be in their slow-start phases be-
fore the download is complete. Therefore, the 4-path MT-
PCP for small ﬁle transfers in principal leverages 4 slow-
start phases simultaneously to fetch the one ﬁle. This may
cause some fairness issues for other users sharing the same
bottlenecks as MPTCP subﬂows.
Effect of congestion controllers.
In terms of diﬀerent MPTCP congestion controllers, we do
not see much diﬀerence between coupled, olia, and reno for
small ﬂows (except for 4 MB). This is likely due to the fact
that most of time the connection terminates during the slow-
start phase(s) if no loss occurs and the congestion controllers
do not begin to operate.
Effect of background trafﬁc.
Figure 6 shows the measurement results performed in a
public WiFi hotspot oﬀered by a coﬀee shop in downtown
Amherst on a Friday afternoon, where the traﬃc load is high
over the WiFi path, and we also used WiFi as the default
path. During the measurements, there were on average 15
to 20 customers connecting to the WiFi hotspot with their
laptops, iPads, and smart phones. For the sake of time, we
did not measure the performance of olia. We observe from
the results that (1): WiFi is unreliable and does not always
provide the best path, (2): MPTCP performs close to the
best available path. Figure 12 depicts the fraction of traf-
ﬁc carried over the cellular path in MPTCP connections for
diﬀerent ﬁle sizes. Compared to the previous results (Fig-
ure 5), we observe that more traﬃc is transmitted over the
cellular network. This is because the WiFi path is very
unreliable and lossy and, hence, MPTCP oﬄoads the traf-
ﬁc to the more reliable cellular connection. These results
show that MPTCP performs resonably well even in an ex-
treme situation. Note that for 8 KB ﬁle size, we observe
that MPTCP performs better than single-path TCP over
WiFi even if MPTCP sends no traﬃc over cellular. This
is because the WiFi path exhibits very large RTT variabil-
ity and we did not have enough measurement samples to
provide statistically meaningful results for the 8 KB case.
Table 4 shows the average loss rates and RTTs over WiFi
and AT&T connections.
4.1.2
Simultaneous SYNs
Current MPTCP implementations require a ﬁrst ﬂow to
be established for information exchange (i.e., sender/client
key and interface information) before adding a second ﬂow.
The approach of delaying the SYN packet for the second
ﬂow exhibits the following beneﬁts: 1) it is safe and easier
to fall back on legacy TCP if the other end does not speak
MPTCP, and 2) it provides a higher level of connection se-
curity with key exchange. However, if the servers are known
to be MPTCP-capable and the connections have been au-
thorized, this delayed-SYN procedure postpones the usage
of the second path and hence increases the download time,
especially for small ﬂows.

For performance purposes, we modify the current MPTCP
implementation to allow the client to send SYN packets si-
multaneously over each of its available paths to the server.
In principle, this can allow the user to establish both its
paths simultaneously and will reduce the download time of
the ﬁle. This can also improve the performance of MPTCP

in cases where the default path (WiFi in our case) is very
lossy or has a large RTT.
Figure 8 shows that based on our measurements, even with
large average RTT ratios, the simultaneous-SYN MPTCP
on average reduces the download time by 14% for 512 KB
ﬁles and 5% for 2 MB ﬁles, respectively. There could be
even greater beneﬁt if the RTTs of the paths are similar,
especially for small downloads. Note that simultaneous SYN
and delayed SYN might not diﬀer much for very small size
ﬁles since most of the packets can be delivered through the
ﬁrst path (as the initial congestion window is 10 packets).

control with load balancing. Our results show how current
MPTCP congestion controllers (coupled and olia) perform
in the wild, rather than in the environments where most of
the traﬃc is well-controlled [19, 32]. We compare the results
to a baseline where we use uncoupled New Reno (reno) as
the congestion controller.
Figure 9 presents the results. We observe that: (1) WiFi
is no longer the best path and MPTCP always outperforms
the best single-path TCP, (2) 4-path MPTCP always out-
performs its 2-path counterpart, (3) MPTCP-olia consis-
tently performs slightly better than MPTCP-coupled.
In
particular, we observe that MPTCP-olia performs similarly
to MPTCP-coupled for ﬁle size of 4 MB, and reduces the
download latencies of ﬁles of sizes 8 MB, 16 MB, and 32
MB by 5%, 6%, and 10%, respectively, in both 2-path and
4-path scenarios). TCP New Reno performs better because
it is more aggressive and not fair to other users. In contrast,
olia’s better performance (compared to coupled) is due to
its better load balancing in the network [19].
Figure 10 shows that in all conﬁgurations, over 50% of
traﬃc is now routed through the cellular path instead of
WiFi. This is because, in large ﬂow downloads, the cellular
path’s very low loss rate compensates for its much larger
RTTs. Table 5 lists the RTTs and loss rates seen by the
subﬂows on a per connection average. We see from this
table that WiFi loss rates varies from 1.6% to 2.1%, while
4G LTE provides very consistent and low loss rate of 0.01%,
and the per connection average RTTs are more stable (i.e.,
have much lower variability).
To exclude the possibility that the 4-path performance
gain is due solely to the beneﬁts of having multiple slow-start
phases, we also performed measurements of transferring ex-
tremely large ﬁles of size 512 MB separately to approximate
inﬁnite backlog traﬃc. We performed the measurements for
2-path and 4-path MPTCP using coupled and uncoupled
New Reno as congestion controller with 10 iterations each
(results of olia are omitted for lack of space). Figure 11
shows that the download time is around 6-7 minutes, hence
the eﬀect of slow starts should be negligible. The results of 4-
path MPTCP conﬁrms the results in Figure 9 as we observe
