User: Please introduce the principles of SQL injection attacks and provide defense methods.
Assistant: SQL injection is a common web security vulnerability attack. Its principle is that an attacker injects malicious SQL code at the input point of a web application to obtain sensitive information or modify data in a database. SQL injection attacks generally fall into two categories: error-based injection and blind injection. Error-based injection: The attacker obtains sensitive information in the database by inputting special SQL statements and using the program exception handling mechanism. For example, enter the following SQL code in the user name and password input boxes on the login page: ' or 1=1# This code will be spliced into the SQL query statement, so that the conditions of the query statement are bypassed, and any user can Log in. The # sign is a comment symbol in the SQL statement, which can prevent subsequent SQL statements from being executed. Blind injection: The attacker obtains sensitive information through trial and error without knowing the database structure and data. For example, an attacker can enter the following SQL statement: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND substr(password,1,1)='a'; If the return result of this SQL statement is 1, then The attacker can guess that the first character of the administrator's password is a, and then continue to try the next character until the correct password is obtained. Here are some ways to defend against SQL injection attacks: 1. Parameterized queries: Use predefined parameters to replace input variables, thereby avoiding SQL injection attacks. For example, in Java, you can use the parameterized query method of the PreparedStatement class, as follows: PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"); stmt.setString(1, username ); stmt.setString(2, password); 2. Input verification: strictly verify the data entered by the user, exclude illegal characters, and only allow the input of necessary characters. For example, regular expressions can be used to verify the user name and password on the login page, only letters and numbers are allowed, and comment symbols and special characters are not allowed. 3. The principle of least privilege: set the minimum operation privilege in the database to prevent attackers from gaining administrator privileges by injecting code, thereby modifying the data in the database. 4. Error message prompt: Do not return the error message to the user directly to avoid leaking sensitive information. The error information can be recorded in the log file to facilitate subsequent investigation and repair.
