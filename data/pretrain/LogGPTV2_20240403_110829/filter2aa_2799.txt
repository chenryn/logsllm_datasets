## Why Did We Do It?
- Challenged with, "I bet you can’t hack that."
- No one had done it before.
- Saw it as a potential target for future amusement.
- We were under the influence and thought it was a good idea at the time.

## The Company
- **International Telecommunications Company**
  - Claims to have the only digital billboard network in the country.
  - Other companies are now entering the market, citing environmental benefits.
  - Expanding their network to various parts of Europe.
- **Litigation Happy**

## Types of Billboards
1. **Verizon Telephone Network Interface**
   - Contains a clearly marked ADSL POTS splitter and half-ringer.
   - Instructions for testing and wiring accessible from an exposed phone jack.
   - Self-actuated data connections for updates presumed.

2. **Wireless/Satellite**
   - Nondescript box with a satellite dish.
   - Access and maintenance via satellite, POTS, and wireless.
   - Potential security risks due to unencrypted wireless traffic.

3. **Plug-in Box**
   - Unlabeled box secured with a standard commercial Master lock.
   - Medium of external communication unknown but POTS conjectured.

## Physical Vulnerabilities

  - One security camera, no surrounding barriers.
  - Located off the side of roads with low traffic between 2:30 and 4:00 AM.
  - Often within walking distance of nearly empty parking lots.
  - Locked with a commercial Master lock (sometimes no lock at all).

## Network Vulnerabilities
- **Wireless Access**
  - No passwords or encryption required.
- **Packet Sniffing**
  - Can see broadcast destinations and potentially spoof addresses.
- **War Dialing**
  - Concerns about unused ports and default credentials.
- **Security Practices**
  - Not closing unused ports.
  - Using default and global usernames/passwords.
