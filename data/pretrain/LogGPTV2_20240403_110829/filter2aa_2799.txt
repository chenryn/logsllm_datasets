What do we cover?
• Tools and Information Needed
In case you wanted to try hacking the billboard, here’s 
some information and tools that will come in handy. 
    We are not suggesting, 
teaching, or condoning the hacking of The Company’s 
Outdoor Digital Billboard Network. 
• Physical and Network Vulnerabilities
Yes, they exist and yes, there are many of them
What do we cover?
• What *NOT* to Do
A few things that you would want to avoid if you were 
going to attempt hacking the billboard. (See previous 
slide for Obligatory Disclaimer)
• The Purpose a Hacked Digital Billboard 
Serves
Who would want to do this? Why?
Why did we do it?
• Was told, “I bet you can’t hack that.”
• No one had done it yet
• Saw it as a possible target for future lulz
• We were drunk and it sounded like a 
good idea at the time
Who are they?
• International telecommunications 
company
• Boasts that they have the only digital 
billboard network in the country
This is quickly changing as other companies are 
realizing they can save and make money by doing this 
as well as get the environmentalists off their back (can 
claim they’re being “green” by not building more 
billboards). By the time that this presentation is given, 
they will also have added billboards in various parts of 
Europe.
The Company (Cont.)
• VERY litigation happy 
They have a super big team of lawyers (we assume) 
and we have… none. So we’re not going to specify 
which company it is and maintain that this is for 
informational purposes only. 
• Appears as the blurry thing in all of our 
pictures
Blurred out because, again, they’re very litigation 
happy.
• Utilizes different manufacturers for their 
boards
This provides various ways to get into their network.
Billboard
To our knowledge, three primary types of billboards exist:
• The first type contains a Verizon Telephone Network 
Interface with clearly marked ADSL POTS splitter and 
half-ringer.  
• Instructions as to the testing and wiring of the 
telephone line accessible from an exposed phone jack 
suggest the performance of a basic GO-NO-GO 
continuity test from the site of said billboard; further use 
and/or potential vulnerabilities of this line for remote 
access are unknown.  
• Self-actuated data connections for update purposes 
are presumed.
Billboard with Verizon 
Telephone Network Interface 
Wireless/Satelite
• The second type of billboard site noted 
contains a nondescript box with a satellite dish. 
• It is known that the only three methods of 
billboard access and maintenance are satellite, 
POTS and wireless.  
• The existence of POTS in addition to 
potentially unencrypted wireless traffic at the 
sites of digital billboards presents a theoretical 
security risk in the instance of the presence of 
potential intruders on the intranet.
The billboard (Cont.)
Plug in
• An unlabeled box similar to the one present at 
the second classification also exists at the site 
of the third, secured with a standard 
commercial Master brand lock. 
• The medium of external communication from 
this billboard is unknown at present, although 
the presence of POTS is conjectured.  
• An E-Clips surge suppressor is also visible at 
the site of the third billboard.

Physical Vulnerabilities
• Social Engineering
-- Sales people are really cool people because they’ll 
answer any question you have if they think they’re 
going to get a sale. We were able to find out image 
specs, uploading information, and some security 
procedures. 
    Sooper Seekrit Passphrase: Money is no option.
-- “I work for IT” or “I’m a college student majoring in 
marketing”. Yeah, they still fall for that.
Physical Vulns (cont.)
• The Billboard
--One security camera, pointing at the images on the 
billboard
--Nothing surrounding the area around the billboard on 
the ground (gate, fence, etc.)
--Located off the side of a road, most of which don’t 
experience heavy traffic between 2:30 and 4:00 in the 
morning.
Physical Vulnerabilities 
(cont.)
• The Billboard (cont.)
--Usually within walking 
distance of a parking lot 
that’s almost empty 
during the same hours
--The only thing between 
you and the console at 
the bottom of a billboard 
is a:
    Commercial 
Masterlock
                (LOL!)
NOTE: Sometimes there 
isn’t a lock at all.
Network Vulnerabilities
• They are vulnerable to:
--People connecting wirelessly (that’s right folks, to 
connect, you don’t have to worry about passwords or 
encryption)
--Packet sniffing (able to see where they’re 
broadcasting to, could spoof the address, and voila)
--War dialing (depends on the location, but we were 
told by a sales associate that this is one of their 
concerns)
Network Vulns. (cont.)
• They are guilty of:
--Not closing unused ports
--Using default usernames/passwords (admin, 
password, etc.)
--Using global usernames/passwords (A newly found 
friend of ours that works for them told us this)
Information
• Image requirements
From The Company’s web site: 
DIGITAL BULLETINs
 200 h x 704 w pixel resolution or 
 2.778” h x 9.778” w (No Bleed)
RGB / 72 DPI / JPG format
• Which billboard you’re going to go to
It helps to plan ahead when and where you’re going. 
• Cover story
This is useful for when you’re questioned by authority 
figures (police, parents, etc). 
Tools
• A laptop
Depending on which billboard you approach, you may 
need a laptop with all of the spiffy wireless and packet 
sniffing tools that are out there nowadays.
• Lock pick kit 
+1 “Ninja” point. +1 Style
• Bolt Cutters (in lieu of lock pick kit)
-1 “Ninja” point. +1 “brute forcing” point.
• Misc. tools dependent upon the type of 
billboard.
What Not to Do
• Try this during the day or peak hours of 
the evening
As a rule of thumb, wait about half an hour after last 
call to ensure that the drunks are well on their way 
home and the cops are busy with them, not you.
• Do it during the holidays and/or weekend
• Forget to use gloves
• Mess with the box with the bright orange 
sticker
What not to do (cont.)
• Hack a billboard near your house
• Leave any sort of evidence that you were 
there (besides the image)
• Pay for the advert and claim it was a 
hack.
Who would do this?
• (Graffiti) Artists
It’s a new medium that is in a public place that gets lots 
of exposure.
• Young people
Hormones + Destruction of someone else’s property = 
lulz
• Hackers
It’s something new to exploit and take advantage of. 
Who would want to do this? 
(Cont.)
• Extremists
Digital billboards would be a great way for them to 
spread their message to a large audience quickly and 
with little or no cost to them.
• Governments
See above.
Why would they want to?
• Vandalism
There will always be someone who wants to destroy 
someone else’s property (for example, adding a word 
bubble next to [insert name here]’s face that says 
“LOLDONGS”). 
• Digital Graffiti
Again, it’s a new medium and they can either slightly 
alter pre-existing adverts to convey something else or 
the images can be taken offline and the graffiti artists 
could use the then-blank billboard as a clean canvas.
Why would they want to do 
this? (cont.)
• Guerilla Advertising
Sort of became a buzz word that doesn’t hold any true meaning to 
the listener. It usually alludes to aggressive, unconventional 
marketing methods that is done on the cheap, uses psychology 
and focuses more on creativity and generating more referrals and 
bigger transactions.
• Spreading propaganda 
Why just settle for the news, tv commercials, emails, and posters? 
By posting your message on the billboard network, it’ll appear for 
eight seconds on every billboard in that particular network 
repeatedly for an undetermined amount of time.
• The Lulz
Note: This defense will only be useful in Internet court.
