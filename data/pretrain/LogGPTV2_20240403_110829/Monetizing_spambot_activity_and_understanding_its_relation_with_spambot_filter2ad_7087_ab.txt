cannot afford to choose due to his limited wealth (W ). So,
we call the set of all possible consumption bundles that a
spammer can afford as the competitive budget set. This is
formally deﬁned in Equation. 3 as:
L(P,W ) = {∀ β ∈ (cid:60)K|βT
l × Pl ≤ W}.
(3)
is simply the transpose of βl.
where βT
l
This ﬁnalizes the deﬁnition of spam commodity. Then,
come the next step that how a consumer will choose different
commodities, which basically depicts the choice behavior of
consumer. We have assumed a rational behavior of spam-
mer, which simpliﬁes the choice structure but for a ratio-
nal behavior of a consumer, commodity model must exhibit
some basic properties. We show that our spam commodity
model exhibit all those properties and it is safe to assume
rational behavior of spammer. This leads to the last step of
economic modeling, establishing the spammer utility func-
tion. Because that will decided how a spammer compares
different consumption bundles.
3.2 Formulation of a Spammer’s Objective Function
The choice that a consumer makes is called a Preference
Relation (cid:23). It is a binary relation on the set of alternatives
of consumption bundles, allowing the comparison of pairs
of consumption bundles. If, β1 and β2 are two consumption
bundles then β1 (cid:23) β2 means β1 is at least as good as
β2 and β1 (cid:31) β2 means β1 is preferred to β2. The role of
the preference relation between consumption bundles is very
critical as its absence makes an economic model unsolvable.
We assume that the choice behavior of spammer is ra-
tional, which demands certain properties to be true for the
model. We discuss these as follows:
1. Preference relation (cid:23) should be rational i.e. it should
be complete and transitive. Completeness implies that
∀βl, βj ∈ L(P,W ) either βl (cid:23) βj or βj (cid:23) βl. Transi-
tivity says that ∀βl, βj, βm ∈ Ł(P,W ), if βl (cid:23) βj and
βj (cid:23) βm then βl (cid:23) βm. Explanation: Every commod-
ity represents an outcome and every consumption bundle
has an aggregated outcome, so all consumption bundles
in competitive budget set hold this property.
2. Preference relation (cid:23) should be monotone: if a consump-
tion bundle βl has more number of commodities than
another consumption bundle βj, then βl (cid:23) βj. Expla-
nation: There may exist two consumption bundles with
same aggregate rate, how to choose the preferred one?
An earlier study [12] introduced the concept of virtual
bots, thus to create an uncertainty about the success of
a botnet outcome. They call it the probability of failure
for each botnet and it is independent from each other.
Let’s assume that the probability of failure due to un-

certainty for each commodity is same, say P r{ck}. Sup-
pose there exist two consumption bundles, β1 = {c1, c2}
and β2 = {c3} and C1 = C2. Then, the associated
probability of failure of both consumption bundles are
P r{β1} = P r{c1} ∗ P r{c2} and P r{β2} = P r{c3}.
We use the same concept in our model and in this exam-
ple β1 is preferred over β2. This satisﬁes the monotone
property.
3. The preference relation, (cid:23), should be convex such that
for every βl ∈ L(P,W ) the upper contour set is con-
vex: if βj (cid:23) βl, βm (cid:23) βl, and βm not equal to βj, then
αβj + (1 − α)βm (cid:23) βl for any α ∈ [0, 1]. Explana-
tion: In standard economic theory, there are two reasons
to impose this assumption: a) consumers typically like
to consume mixed consumption bundles, i.e., it is better
to use another consumption bundle with more number of
commodities than one with single commodity; and b) It
diminishes the marginal rate of substitution. Let us map
both of these reasons to our spamming commodity struc-
ture. Reason (a) is catered for in second property above.
For reason (b), suppose we have a function F () that cal-
culates the utility of a consumption bundle. If there is
bundle β1 = {c1, c2} then by diminishing the marginal
rate of substitution, given by ∂F (β1)
∂c2 , the con-
sumer requires more units of c1 to remove one unit of c2
to get the same utility. This gives stability to a consump-
tion bundle by creating an area of indifference around it
and indirectly gives a conﬁdence to the spammer in his
selection. Same holds in our commodity structure as the
conﬁdence value associated with each commodity and
evasion due to diversity (second property) make the as-
sociated cost of each substitution non-linear.
∂c1 / ∂F (β1)
The eventual goal of a spammer is to maximize the total
utility, so we need to formalize an utility function for spam
commodity. According to the deﬁnition of utility function:
DEFINITION 1. A function u : βl → L(P,W ) is a utility
function representing preference relation (cid:23) if ∀βl, βj ∈
L(P,W ), βl (cid:23) βj ⇔ u(βl) ≥ u(βj).
We formulate our utility function for each commodity
considering three factors: 1) Commodity outcome; 2) Diver-
sity of consumption bundle; 3) Failure probability of con-
sumption bundle. Equation. 4 deﬁnes the utility function for
a consumption bundle as:
u(βl) =
ck + (|βl| ∗ (1 − P r{ck}))

4. Constraining The Spam Economic Model
As mentioned before, the second objective of this paper is
to constrain the spammer utility function using statistical
features of mail trafﬁc and materialize the impact of each
feature. From existing literature [6, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23] we
select critical trafﬁc features and we discuss them as under.
Inter-Departure Time (IDT)
4.1
The foremost distinctive feature is the inter departure time
between mails. It
is the time between two consecutive
emails. Spammers want to send as many emails as possi-
ble in a small time period to maximize the outcome. Let, ∆t
be the time interval between two consecutive spam mails.
Even though it changes during the course of spam campaign
but in end mean IDT (µ(idt)) is sufﬁcient to calculate the
volume of total outcome. A commodity ck represents the
total outcome of a botnet with µ(idt) = 0 and increasing the
IDT really reduces the effective outcome of a commodity.
So, the Equation. 1 is changed to Equation. 6.
(cid:101)ν =
N(cid:88)
i=1
Bi
S + (µ(idt) ∗ Bi)
(6)
where |βl| gives the count of commodities in a consump-
tion bundle βl. As mentioned earlier the goal of a spammer
is to maximize his utility, than concludes the objective func-
tion in Equation. 5.
The intuition of Equation. 6 is simple. As Bi represents
the bits per second (unit time) and µ(idt) represents a pause,
which can be translated into the loss of bits that could have
been sent otherwise. Figure. 1 shows the possible impact of
this constraint on spammer utility..

4.2 Emails Per Recipient (EPR)
A normal user tend to send most of his mails to only a group
of recipients, to whom he is connected socially or through
business. On the other hand, a spammer avoids sending too
many mails to a subset of recipients to avoid detection. Let,
ω be the total number of recipients email addresses owned
by spammer. If a spammer can safely send θ number of
emails to each recipient without alerting any spam ﬁlter then
the aggregated outcome is constrained by θ ∗ ω, so ideally
θ ∗ ω > max(Cl ∈ L(P,W )). Even though spammer may
have more wealth (W ), but EPR can potentially further con-
strain the competitive budget set, see Figure. 1. So, the new
competitive budget set constraint is given by Equation. 7.

5. Conclusion
Spam botnets are no more driven by personal agenda but
by the underlying economic engine. Most intrusion detec-
tion techniques had approached spam botnets as a purely be-
havioral trafﬁc detection problem using statistical features of
mail trafﬁc. Recently some efforts were made to comprehend
the underly economic engine of spam. These studies either
took the road to provide abstract economic model or took a
measurement based approach to quantify spam economy. In
this paper we have formalized the spam economic system to
monetize spammer efforts into utility. We have used standard
consumer economic theory to calculate the spammer utility.
We have also constrained our economic model using trafﬁc
features, inter-departure time and emails per recipients, dis-
cussed by existing literature as key features to discern spam
trafﬁc.
