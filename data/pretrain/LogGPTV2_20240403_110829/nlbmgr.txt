If the Network Load Balancing Manager attempts to contact a host that isn't available, you'll experience a delay when using this option.
/hostlist

/autorefresh 
Causes the Network Load Balancing Manager to refresh its host and cluster information every  seconds. If no interval is specified, the information is refreshed every 60 seconds.
