User: Your company uses a load balancer to make applications highly available. Please provide a reliable load balancer configuration.
Assistant: The following is a reliable load balancer configuration scheme: 1. Configure the load balancer to use round-robin algorithm or IP hash algorithm for load balancing. A round robin algorithm distributes requests among servers, while an IP hash algorithm selects a specific server based on the requesting IP address. 2. Configure health checks to ensure that the load balancer does not send requests to servers that are offline. Typically, health checks can be done by checking response status codes or TCP port checks for specific URLs. 3. Use SSL termination to ensure all connections are encrypted. This will ensure that sensitive data is protected during transmission. 4. Enable HTTP/2 protocol to improve performance. HTTP/2 can send multiple requests and responses simultaneously over a single connection. 5. Use caching and enable HTTP(S) session persistence. Caching reduces the load on the server, while session persistence ensures that individual user requests are sent to the same server. 6. Configure an appropriate load balancing algorithm to ensure that for your specific application and server architecture, the load balancer maximizes server resource utilization and reduces response time. 7. Configure the load balancer to correct the unbalanced load. If a server is overloaded, it should be removed from the load balancer and relocated to other servers. 8. Regularly monitor load balancers and servers to react and fix problems before they may arise.
