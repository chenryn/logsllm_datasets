User: I'm new to google's protocol buffers and looking into some insight. I have a large object that is serialized in java which I am de-serializing in python. The upstream tells me that the file is serialized in about 4 to 5 seconds. Where it takes me 37 seconds to de-serialize. Any ideas on why it is such a huge difference besides hardware? are there ways I can speed up the de-serialization? Does Java perform better for this? I'm simply grabbing a serialized data file and using ParseFromString.
Thanks
UPDATE:- So just got back to this after a while and tried to deserialize the file using java. It took 4 seconds to deserialize a bigger file (56 m). Now this solves my problem with the performance however, I really am confused about the huge difference between the python and java, any insights?
Assistant: Unfortunately the Python protobuf deserialization is just pretty slow (as of 2013) compared to the other languages.
