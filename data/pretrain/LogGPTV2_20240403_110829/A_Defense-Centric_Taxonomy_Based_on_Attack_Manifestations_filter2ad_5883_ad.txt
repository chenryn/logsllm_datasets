tion, and IDS performance scores. Taxonomic classes: FS
(class 1, foreign sequence), MFS (class 2, minimal foreign
sequence), DS (class 3, dormant sequence), MNA (class 4,

Classes 3 and 4 are assigned the same score of 1, because
neither is detectable by the IDS. See discussion, Section 5.8.
created which met all the requirements such that a compar-
ison between the attack-centric Lincoln taxonomy and the
present defense-centric taxonomy could proceed.
5.10 Compare attack/defense-centric taxonomies
Each of the 25 attacks was classiﬁed according to both
the Lincoln attack-centric taxonomy and the new defense-
centric taxonomy. Each attack belongs to a pair of classes,
one attack-centric and one defense-centric. If the two tax-
onomies are equivalent, from a defender’s perspective, then
a single attack-centric class should always be paired with a
single defense-centric class, with no overlap. This was not
found to be the case

Attacks in three of the Lincoln classes mapped to mul-
tiple defense-centric classes (the surveillance/probe class
contained no attacks, because there is such controversy over
whether or not a probe constitutes an attack). Four at-
tacks in the Lincoln user-to-root class mapped to four dif-
ferent defense-centric classes. Attacks spanning three Lin-
coln classes mapped to just one defense-centric class. The
mappings are shown in Figure 2; unfortunately, space limi-
tations preclude a more detailed illustration.

6 Results and discussion
Twenty-ﬁve attacks were categorized in accordance with
each of two taxonomies – an existing attack-centric taxon-
omy (from Lincoln Lab) and a new defense-centric taxon-
omy. Two major outcomes were: (1) a validation of the
claim that a defense-centric taxonomy can predict whether
or not an intrusion detection system is capable of detecting
all attacks in particular classes of attacks; and (2) a compar-
ison of the predictive power of an attack-centric taxonomy
vs. a defense-centric taxonomy.
In every case, the classiﬁcation of an attack according to
the defense-centric taxonomy perfectly predicts the detec-
tor’s ability to detect the attack. This outcome demonstrates
that a defense-centric taxonomy is a capable predictor of
whether or not an intrusion detection system can detect a
given attack and all attacks in a class. Demonstrating this
was a major goal of the research. The results are depicted
in Table 6.
In terms of comparing the predictive capabilities of
attack-centric vs. defense-centric taxonomies, from the per-
spective of a defender who needs to know whether or not
his/her detector will detect a particular attack, the defense-
centric taxonomy was an accurate predictor, whereas the
attack-centric taxonomy was not. The primary reason for
the inaccuracy of the attack-centric taxonomy is exempli-
ﬁed by there having been four different user-to-root (attack-
centric) attacks that mapped to four different defense-
centric classes. This suggests that knowing an attacker’s
goals, e.g., privilege elevation from user to root, tells a
defender little about what evidence would be left behind
in sensor data, should the attacker’s objective be accom-
plished. Conversely, that many attack-centric classes map
to a single defense-centric class suggests that it would be
difﬁcult for a defender, looking at the manifestation of an
attack in the sensor data available, to discern what the at-
tacker was attempting to accomplish with the attack. The
results are illustrated in Figure 2.
It is not the purpose of this work to disparage any attack-
centric taxonomy. Attack-centric taxonomies have their
place, but not necessarily in the service of intrusion detec-
tion. For example, a defender could use the attack-centric
class of an attack to estimate the severity of the attack and
its likely effect on the defender’s organization. If a novel
remote-to-local attack were discovered on a weekend, the
system administrator might be called into work to take im-
mediate action to guard against the attack, whereas if the
attack were denial-of-service, the defensive action could be
postponed until Monday. The two taxonomy types could
complement one another, with the attack-centric taxonomy
being used to estimate the severity of an attack, and the
defense-centric taxonomy being used to determine the suit-
ability of defenses.
7 Conclusion
This work has demonstrated that the classes of an attack-
centric taxonomy are not equivalent to those of a defense-
centric taxonomy. While a defense-centric taxonomy can
be used successfully to predict whether or not a set of de-
fenses is capable of detecting a particular attack based on
its classiﬁcation in a taxonomy, an attack-centric taxonomy
cannot be used in this way. This is more alarming than it is
surprising, because defenders presently have no alternatives
to various extant attack-centric taxonomies, many of which
were noted in Section 1. This work has produced the ﬁrst
known, validated defense-centric taxonomy5.
It is hoped
that others will follow.
