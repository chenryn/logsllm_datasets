# Manifestation Not Anomalous (MNA) and Other Taxonomic Classes

## Introduction
This document discusses the classification of 25 attacks using both an attack-centric taxonomy (Lincoln Laboratory) and a new defense-centric taxonomy. The taxonomic classes and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) performance scores are detailed, followed by a comparison of the two taxonomies.

## Table 6: Attacks, Detected Features, Taxonomic Classification, and IDS Performance Scores

- **Taxonomic Classes:**
  - **FS (Class 1, Foreign Sequence):** Attacks that introduce foreign sequences.
  - **MFS (Class 2, Minimal Foreign Sequence):** Attacks that introduce minimal foreign sequences.
  - **DS (Class 3, Dormant Sequence):** Attacks that introduce dormant sequences.
  - **MNA (Class 4, Manifestation Not Anomalous):** Attacks that do not manifest as anomalies.

- **IDS Scores:**
  - **1 (Never Detectable):** The IDS cannot detect the attack.
  - **2 (Sometimes Detectable):** The IDS can detect the attack under certain conditions.
  - **3 (Always Detectable):** The IDS can always detect the attack.

- **Classes 3 and 4:** Both are assigned a score of 1, as they are not detectable by the IDS.

## Comparison of Attack-Centric and Defense-Centric Taxonomies

### Section 5.10: Compare Attack/Defense-Centric Taxonomies
Each of the 25 attacks was classified according to both the Lincoln attack-centric taxonomy and the new defense-centric taxonomy. Each attack belongs to a pair of classes, one attack-centric and one defense-centric. If the two taxonomies were equivalent from a defender's perspective, a single attack-centric class should always be paired with a single defense-centric class, with no overlap. This was not found to be the case.

### Mappings
- **Attacks in three of the Lincoln classes** mapped to multiple defense-centric classes.
- **Four attacks in the Lincoln user-to-root class** mapped to four different defense-centric classes.
- **Attacks spanning three Lincoln classes** mapped to just one defense-centric class.

The mappings are illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the relationship between the five Lincoln Laboratory attack-centric classes and the four new defense-centric classes.

## Results and Discussion

### Section 6: Results and Discussion
Twenty-five attacks were categorized using both the existing attack-centric taxonomy (from Lincoln Lab) and the new defense-centric taxonomy. Two major outcomes were:
1. **Validation of the claim** that a defense-centric taxonomy can predict whether or not an intrusion detection system is capable of detecting all attacks in particular classes of attacks.
2. **Comparison of the predictive power** of an attack-centric taxonomy vs. a defense-centric taxonomy.

- **In every case, the classification of an attack** according to the defense-centric taxonomy perfectly predicts the detector’s ability to detect the attack.
- **From the perspective of a defender**, the defense-centric taxonomy was an accurate predictor, whereas the attack-centric taxonomy was not.
- **Reason for inaccuracy**: Four different user-to-root (attack-centric) attacks mapped to four different defense-centric classes, indicating that knowing an attacker’s goals tells little about what evidence would be left behind in sensor data.

### Complementary Use
- **Attack-centric taxonomies** have their place, but not necessarily in the service of intrusion detection. They can be used to estimate the severity of an attack.
- **Defense-centric taxonomies** can determine the suitability of defenses.
- **Both types** can complement each other, with the attack-centric taxonomy estimating the severity and the defense-centric taxonomy determining the detectability.

## Conclusion

### Section 7: Conclusion
- **Equivalence of Taxonomies**: The classes of an attack-centric taxonomy are not equivalent to those of a defense-centric taxonomy.
- **Predictive Power**: A defense-centric taxonomy can predict whether a set of defenses is capable of detecting a particular attack, while an attack-centric taxonomy cannot.
- **First Validated Defense-Centric Taxonomy**: This work produced the first known, validated defense-centric taxonomy.
