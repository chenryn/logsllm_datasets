### 1. Introduction to Wavelet Waveforms

**Figure 5.** Some wavelet waveforms:
- (a) 'wiggle' (Mother Haar Wavelet)
- (b) 'bump' (Father Haar Wavelet)
- (c) Mother S8 Symmlet
- (d) Father S8 Symmlet

The inner product \((f, g)\) is defined as:
\[
(f, g) = \int f(t)g(t) \, dt
\]
When the wavelet is a 'bump', these are called 'scaling coefficients'; when the wavelet is a 'wiggle', they are called 'wavelet coefficients'. See Figure 6.

### 2. Central Question and Analysis

Our central question is: if \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) obey causality and maximum tolerable delay constraints, how similar are the coefficients \(\alpha_{j,k}^1\) and \(\alpha_{j,k}^2\)? We analyze the character counting functions of both streams across different time scales to determine how similarly the character arrivals cluster at each time scale.

### 3. Analysis by Multiscale Block Averages

#### 3.1. Choice of ψ
Here, we choose \(\psi\) to be a simple 'bump'—the "boxcar" function \(\psi(t) = 1_{[0,1]}\) depicted in Figure 5, panel (b). We set \(p = 1\), and the coefficients amount to simple averages of the data over blocks of various lengths and locations. This choice of \(\psi\) corresponds to the analysis of "multiscale block averages."

#### 3.2. Dyadic Boxcar Family
We analyze the stream functions \(N_i(t)\) using the dyadic boxcar family:
\[
\psi_{j,k}(t) = \frac{\psi\left(\frac{t - k2^j}{2^j}\right)}{2^j}
\]

#### 3.3. Estimation of Quantities
At each scale level \(j\), we estimate two quantities:
- The typical size of \(\alpha_{j,k}^1\)
- The maximal deviation of \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2\)

For a Poisson input stream \(N_1(t)\) at rate \(\lambda\):
- \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 \approx \lambda \pm O_P(1/\sqrt{\text{scale}})\)
- \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2 \leq O(\log(\text{scale})/\text{scale})\)
- \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2 \ll |\alpha_{j,k}^1|\) at long time scales

In words, the scaling coefficients of the two streams must be very similar at long time scales.

### 4. Analysis by Multiscale Block Differences

#### 4.1. Choice of ψ
Here, we choose \(\psi\) to be a simple 'wiggle'—the Haar wavelet \(\psi(t) = 1_{[1/2,1)} - 1_{[0,1/2)}\) depicted in Figure 5, panel (a). We set \(p = 1/2\), and the coefficients amount to simple scaled differences of averages of the data over blocks of various lengths and locations. This choice of \(\psi\) corresponds to the analysis of "multiscale block differences."

#### 4.2. Dyadic Haar Family
We analyze the stream functions \(N_i(t)\) using the dyadic Haar family:
\[
\psi_{j,k}(t) = \frac{\psi\left(\frac{t - k2^j}{2^j}\right)}{2^{j/2}}
\]

#### 4.3. Estimation of Quantities
At each scale level \(j\), we estimate two quantities:
- The typical size of \(\alpha_{j,k}^1\)
- The maximal deviation of \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2\)

For a Poisson input stream \(N_1(t)\) at rate \(\lambda\):
- \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 \approx O_P(1/\sqrt{\text{scale}})\)
- \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2 \leq O(\log(\text{scale})/\text{scale})\)
- \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2 \ll |\alpha_{j,k}^1|\) at long time scales

In words, the wavelet coefficients of the two streams must be very similar at long time scales.

### 5. Analytical Tools

#### 5.1. Integration by Parts
Let \(\Psi = \Psi(t)\) be a piecewise differentiable function that vanishes outside a finite interval. Then:
\[
\int \Psi \, dN_1 - \int \Psi \, dN_2 = -\int (N_1 - N_2)(t) \, d\Psi(t)
\]
\[
\left| \int \Psi \, d(N_1 - N_2) \right| \leq TV(\Psi) \cdot \max\{|(N_1 - N_2)(t)| : t \in \text{supp}(\Psi)\}
\]
where \(TV(\Psi)\) is the total variation of \(\Psi\).

#### 5.2. Extreme Values of Stochastic Processes
Causality and Maximum Tolerable Delay imply:
\[
N_1(t) \geq N_2(t) \geq N_1(t - \Delta)
\]
\[
|N_1(t) - N_2(t)| \leq N_1(t) - N_1(t - \Delta)
\]
\[
|N_1(t) - N_2(t)| \leq \max\{N_1(t + \Delta) - N_1(t) : t, t + \Delta \in \text{supp}(\Psi)\}
\]

For a Poisson process:
\[
\max\{N_1(t + \Delta) - N_1(t) : t, t + \Delta \in [a, b]\} \leq O_P(\log(b - a)) \cdot E\{N_1(t + \Delta) - N_1(t)\}
\]

### 6. Calculation for Multiscale Block Averages

- Symbols emerge at Poisson arrival times \(t_1, \ldots, t_N\) with rate \(\lambda\).
- The 'bump' has mean 1, so \(E[\alpha_{j,k}^1] = \lambda\).
- \(Var[\alpha_{j,k}^1] = \text{Const} \cdot \lambda/\text{scale}\).
- Random fluctuations: \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 \approx \lambda \pm c/\sqrt{\text{scale}}\).
- Maximum fluctuation: \(| \alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2 | \leq O(\log(\text{scale})/\text{scale})\).

### 7. Calculation for Multiscale Block Differences

- Symbols emerge at Poisson arrival times \(t_1, \ldots, t_N\) with rate \(\lambda\).
- The 'wiggle' has mean 0, so \(E[\alpha_{j,k}^1] = 0\).
- \(Var[\alpha_{j,k}^1] = \text{Const} \cdot \lambda/\text{scale}\).
- Random fluctuations: \(\alpha_{j,k}^1 \approx \pm c/\sqrt{\text{scale}}\).
- Maximum fluctuation: \(| \alpha_{j,k}^1 - \alpha_{j,k}^2 | \leq O(\log(\text{scale})/\text{scale})\).

### 8. Simulation: Local Inter-Keystroke Shuffling (LIS)

**Figure 7.** LIS Transform:
- Row of 'x' – arrival times in the original stream.
- Row of 'o' – arrival times in the transformed stream.
- Vertical lines demarcate zones of 8 characters.
- Top group of horizontal lines – lengths depict inter-keystroke times.
- Bottom group – lengths depict the same times, but shuffled within one zone.

**Properties of LIS:**
- **Identical Distribution:** The new stream has inter-keystroke times with the same distribution as the original stream.
- **Causality:** Characters arrive in Stream 2 later than Stream 1 (\(t_i \leq u_i\)).
