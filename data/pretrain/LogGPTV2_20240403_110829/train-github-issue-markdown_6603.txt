Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"4", GitVersion:"v1.4.3", GitCommit:"4957b090e9a4f6a68b4a40375408fdc74a212260", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2016-10-16T06:20:04Z", GoVersion:"go1.6.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

**Environment:**
- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration:** AWS
- **OS:** Default provisioned by kops
- **Kernel:** Default provisioned by kops
- **Install tools:** kops
- **Others:** N/A

**What happened:**
The HTML links generated by the kube-apiserver for the `/logs` endpoint do not prefix the filename with `/logs`.

**What you expected to happen:**
Clicking the link to a log file should result in a request to `GET /logs/kube-apiserver.log`.

**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
1. Request to the API server: `GET /logs`
2. Click the link for `kube-apiserver.log`

**Anything else we need to know:**
No additional information is required.
