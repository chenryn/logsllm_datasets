User: Describe the three-way handshake process in the TCP/IP protocol
Assistant: The three-way handshake process in the TCP/IP protocol is the process of establishing a TCP connection, which must be completed before sending data. As shown below: 1. Step 1: The client sends a SYN packet to the server, which contains its own initial serial number (ie SEQ). 2. The second step: After receiving the SYN packet, the server sends an ACK packet to the client, which contains its own initial sequence number (ie SEQ) and the client's sequence number + 1 (ie, the client's SEQ + 1), and also Can contain an own SYN (synchronization bit). 3. The third step: After receiving the ACK packet sent by the server, the client sends an ACK packet to the server, which contains its own serial number + 1 (that is, the server's SEQ + 1). In this process, three packets (SYN, ACK, ACK) are sent and received one after another, completing the synchronization and confirmation of the serial numbers of both parties, and establishing a reliable TCP connection.
