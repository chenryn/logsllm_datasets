Introduction
The mitigation action against a malicious website may differ
greatly depending on how that site is hosted. If it is hosted
under a private apex domain, where all its subdomains and
pages are under the apex domain owner’s direct control, we
could block at the apex domain level. If it is hosted under
a public apex domain though (e.g., a web hosting service
provider), it would be more appropriate to block at the subdo-
main level. Further, for the former case, the private apex do-
main may be legitimate but compromised, or may be attacker-
generated, which, again, would warrant different mitigation
actions: attacker-owned apex domains could be blocked per-
manently, while only temporarily for compromised ones.
In this paper, we study over eight hundred million Virus-
Total (VT) URL scans from Aug. 1, 2019 to Nov. 18, 2019
and build the ﬁrst content agnostic machine learning models
to distinguish between the above mentioned different types
of apex domains hosting malicious websites. Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁrst build a highly accurate model to distinguish between
public and private apex domains. Then we build additional
models to further distinguish compromised domains from
attacker-owned ones. Utilizing our trained models, we con-
duct a large-scale study of the host domains of malicious
websites . We observe that even though public apex domains
are less than 1% of the apexes hosting malicious websites,
they amount to a whopping 46.5% malicious web pages seen
in VT URL feeds during our study period. 19.5% of these
public malicious websites are compromised. Out of the re-
maining websites (53.5%), which are hosted on private apexes,
we observe that attackers mostly compromise benign websites
(65.6%) to launch their attacks, whereas only 34.4% of mali-
cious websites are hosted on domains registered by attackers.
Overall, we observe the concerning trend that the majority
(81.7%) of malicious websites are hosted under apex domains
that attackers do not own.
Every week millions of users are tricked into access mali-
cious websites from where miscreants launch various attacks
including phishing, spams, and malware [14, 19]. Even with
recent advances in techniques and tools to detect malicious
websites [1, 20, 35, 70], many malicious websites are unde-
tected or detected much later after the damage is done [4].
One key reason for this negative trend is that, instead of regis-
tering their own domains, attackers are increasingly hosting
their websites on infrastructures they do not own, evading
detection by current reputation systems [42]. While the detec-
tion of malicious websites, especially phishing and malware
websites registered by attackers, have been extensively stud-
ied [23,28,35], very little has been done to analyze how these
malicious websites are hosted. Knowing this early greatly
helps security professionals take appropriate mitigation ac-
tions. Speciﬁcally, this paper is motivated by the following
questions:
• To what extent attackers host their websites in what
we call public apex domains such as free web hosting,
document sharing or dynamic DNS services? Are they
attacker-owned or compromised?
• For the remaining malicious websites, are they hosted
on compromised domains or attacker-owned domains?
To what extent?
• Do the above four hosting types have different charac-
teristics in terms of attack types, duration, volume, and
reputation?
• How can we proactively detect these different hosting
types of malicious websites?
We ﬁrst make an important distinction between public and
private apex domains. A public apex domain hosts websites
that are not created by and not under the direct control of the
apex domain owner, whereas a private apex domain always
hosts websites under the control of the domain owner. For

example, 000webhostapp.com is a public apex domain, and
alice.000webhostapp.com is a subdomain whose content
is not controlled by 000webhostapp.com owner, but by an
entity Alice that uses 000webhostapp.com’s service. While
the majority of public websites are created utilizing preﬁxes
like above, some public websites are created with path sufﬁxes
(e.g., sites.google.com/site/alice). nsa.gov, on the
other hand, is a private apex domain, and careers.nsa.gov
is a subdomain that is clearly under the control of the NSA.
The distinction between public and private apex domains has
a profound impact on the inference and prediction of mali-
cious domains, especially when it relies on the association of
subdomains belonging to the same apex domain [29, 64]. Fur-
ther, once malicious websites are detected, the actions against
the hosting apex domains would be different depending on
whether they are public or private.
Though there exist lists of public apex domains from multi-
ple sources, they are by no means complete. Even combined,
they account for less than 20% of the public apex domains that
our study identiﬁes. Further, these lists are often not up to date
due to the highly dynamic nature of the public web-hosting
and cloud business. Thus, given a malicious URL, we could
not simply look up such lists to decide whether it is hosted
in public apex domains. In this work, we design a machine
learning model to accurately classify whether a malicious
website is hosted in a public or private apex domain. Our key
observation is that subdomains of private apex domains have
more consistent behavior and properties compared to those of
public apex domains.

mised (e.g.

sites.google.com/site/kailyali). Similarly, for each
website hosted on a private apex, we further classify the apex
domain based on its owner. A malicious website is either
created by attackers on their own registered domains (e.g.,
getbinance.org) or on compromised benign domains (e.g.,
questionpro.com). In the latter case, legitimate domains ex-
ploited for malicious activities are victim domains. Takedown
strategies and who should be contacted differ depending
on the type of the apex domain. Detection of compromised
domains early helps owners identify the root causes of
the security breach, take corrective measures, and control
reputation damage, while SOC (Security Operation Center)
teams may temporarily block such victim domains to protect
their users. On the other hand, attacker-owned domains
would require completely different actions. They are usually
ﬁrst blacklisted to contain the immediate damage. They
could be further shut down through third-party takedown
services [8,12], domain registration deletion [7], or ownership
transferring if they are involved in cybersquatting [2].
Figure 1: Classiﬁcation of malicious URLs
Most research in malicious domains focuses on characteriz-
ing or detecting attacker owned domains [26,34,35,43,61,66].
There have been only a few efforts to either classify compro-
mised phishing domains [30] or to make a distinction between
compromised and attacker created phishing or malware do-
mains [45, 52]. Most of these approaches ﬁrst ﬁlter a limited
number of public domains based on known public domain
lists, and then rely on the contents of websites to build models
using data that are often difﬁcult to collect, e.g., multiple snap-
shots of a website from the Internet Wayback Machine [13,52]
or all the pages belonging to a website [30]. A notable effort
on detecting compromised domains is recently introduced
by Liu et. al [42] where they build a system called Wood-
pecker to train a classiﬁer based on passive DNS data and
web connectivity graphs to identify compromised subdomains
on private apexes, which they term shadow domains. Their
goal is different from ours as they proﬁle the behavior of
benign domains and then identify those deviating from the
proﬁle as shadow domains. In contrast, our work’s key goal
is to accurately identify malicious domains as either compro-
mised, including shadow and path sufﬁx-based websites or
attacker-owned. Nevertheless, building on top of the knowl-
edge gained from these prior work, in this paper we design the
ﬁrst machine learning classiﬁers to accurately differentiate
malicious websites hosted on compromised domains from
those on attacker-owned domains for both public and private
apexes.
In summary, as shown in Figure 1, our work automatically
labels malicious websites (i.e., URLs) as hosted on either
public or private apexes. For public websites, we identify
attacker-owned subdomains/path preﬁxes from compromised
ones. For private websites, we label them as compromised or
attacker-owned apexes.
In this work, we utilize URLs that appeared in VirusTotal
(VT) URL feed from Aug. 1, 2019 to Nov. 18, 2019 as our
main dataset. VT [67] is a state-of-the-art reputation service
that provides aggregated intelligence on any URL by con-
sulting over 70 third-party anti-virus tools and URL/domain
reputation services. We refer to each of these tools as a scan-
ner. VT aggregates the query results every second and makes

contains all URL queries submitted to VT worldwide during
the above mentioned time period. A basic measure of ma-
liciousness from VT results is the number of scanners that
mark a URL as malicious. The higher this value is for a given
URL, the more likely the URL is malicious. Based on prior
research [59, 68] and our empirical analysis, we consider any
URL marked by 5 or more scanners as malicious. Note that,
though we use VT as the main source of intelligence of ma-
licious domains, our approach is general and can be easily
adapted to work with other malicious domain intelligence
sources, as will be discussed in section 6.1.
Speciﬁcally, we make the following three broad contribu-
tions:
A new classiﬁcation of public and private apex do-
mains. Whether a website is hosted in a public or private
apex domain has an important implication in security practice.
We design the ﬁrst classiﬁer to classify public and private
apex domains utilizing historical VT URL feed information.
Our classiﬁer achieves 97.2% accuracy with 97.7% precision
and 95.6% recall.
New classiﬁcation schemes to differentiate compro-
mised and attacker-owned domains appearing in VT.
When scanners mark a website (hosted in either public or
private apexes) as malicious, it is not apparent if its hosting
domain is in fact compromised or attacker-owned. We take
the ﬁrst steps to automatically make this distinction with high
accuracy. For the classiﬁcation of malicious private websites,
our classiﬁer achieves 96.4% accuracy with 99.1% precision
and 92.6% recall. Our classiﬁer for public malicious websites
achieves 97.1% accuracy with 97.2% precision and 98.1%
recall.
A detailed analysis of public/private apex domains
and compromised/attacker-owned domains in VT URL
Feed. Based on our trained machine learning models,
we analyze the detected public/private apex domains and
compromised/attacker-owned domains to gain insights on
the malicious websites seen on VT URL feed, which we be-
lieve help steer future research on the detection of malicious
websites.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
provides information on data sources and preliminaries. Sec-
tion 3 gives an overview of the overall approach proposed in
our work. In Section 4, we provide detailed information about
our data source, VT URL feed, and characterize its behavior
over time. Section 5 contains the crust of our work, where
we detail the classiﬁers we build and their performances. In
Section 6, we then analyze the classiﬁers under various as-
pects including robustness, concept drift, and the quality and
quantity of the training data. Section 7 discusses the lessons
learned and the limitations of our work. Finally, in Section 9,
we conclude the paper.
2 Data Sources and Preliminaries
2.1 Public and Private Apex Domains
As mentioned before, we categorize e2LD (effective Second
Level Domain) domains as public and private apex domains.
An apex domain is public if its subdomains or path sufﬁxes
are not created and not under the control of the apex domain
owner. Similarly, an apex domain is private if its subdomains
are created and managed by the apex domain owner. Accu-
rately identifying these two types of apex domains help SOC
teams to take appropriate measures if they are found to be
malicious.
2.2 VT URL Feed and Scanners
VT provides one of the most popular URL scanning services
widely used in both academia and industry [71]. VT’s URL
scanning service simply pushes a querying URL to over 70
third-party scanners and gives the aggregated results back.
A basic measure of a VT report is the number of scanners
that mark a given website as malicious. Also, each scanner
labels a malicious URL with one of the following attack types:
malicious, phishing, mining, malware, or suspicious. In this
study, we consider any URL marked by 5 or more scanners
as malicious.
We have built a system called VT NOD/NOH (Newly Ob-
served Domains/Hosts) to proﬁle domains observed in VT
URL feed continuously. NOD and NOH incrementally build
an aggregated record for each apex and FQDN (Fully Quali-
ﬁed Domain Name). The record includes the time ﬁrst seen,
the time last seen (the timestamp the apex/FQDN is ﬁrst and
last scanned in VT), the number of times scanned, the num-
ber of times marked malicious, corresponding URLs, and VT
scan summaries. We use VT NOD/NOH to extract features to
build our machine learning models described in Section 5.
