iteration the algorithm may go through all of the edges
in the current graph at most once. Since the number of
edges can be upper bounded by |V |2, and there need to
be |V | iterations (to insert each node), the overal com-
plexity of RH-Builder is O(|V |3) (the worst case is re-
alized only for a complete graph).
4.2 RH-Miner Algorithm
In this section, we propose another algorithm called
RH-Miner, for the case where we have no initial roles.
244244
Essentially, RH-Miner breaks down the problem into
two steps. First, a minimal set of roles is generated
using one of the heuristic approaches known. Gener-
ating a minimal set of roles from a given U P A has been
formally deﬁned by Vaidya et al. [13] as the Role Min-
ing Problem (RMP) (which is also mapped to the Tiling
Databases problem[7]). Therefore, we can directly bor-
row the existing implementation solutions [7, 14] to
RMP.
Once we generate the minimal set of roles, we can ap-
ply RH-Builder to it to come up with the hierarchy with
the minimal number of edges. Our algorithm essentially
breaks one optimization problem into two subtasks. One
weakness of our algorithm is that it not only serializes
the generation of role set and hierarchy, but also spec-
iﬁes the order that roles to be generated ﬁrst followed
by the hierarchy. Therefore, the hierarchy construction
is conditioned on the generation of roles. This creates
extra constraints and overlooks the possibility that hier-
archy could be created simultaneously with the discov-
ery of roles. Thus the solution reached by our algorithm
may not really be optimal.
Example 4. Figure 4 provides two solutions to RHMP
given a set of users U , a set of permissions P RM S,
and the user-permission assignment U P A. Figure 4.(a)
shows the user-permission assignment U P A. Figure
4.(b),(d) and 4.(c),(e) shows two solutions. Both of them
adopt the idea of generating minimal set of roles ﬁrst fol-
lowed by the build of hierarchy with the minimal num-
ber of edges. Each solution generates a set of roles, the
two role sets are different, but they have the same car-
dinality of 3 and therefore both are optimal. The hier-
archies based on the previously generated roles are also

optimal. In a sense that given the same set of roles, no
better solutions available which can achieve less num-
ber of edges. However, we may see that solutions rep-
resented by Figure 4.(b),(d) is superior 1 to the other
shown in 4.(c),(e). This clearly indicates that sequential
optimization of each subprograms might not achieve the
optimality of RHMP. Part of our future work is to look
for solutions better than RH-Miner to address RHMP.

Deploying RBAC requires identiﬁcation of a com-
plete and correct set of roles, and assignment of users
and permission to these roles. This process, known as
role engineering [3], has been identiﬁed as one of the
costliest components in realizing RBAC [6].
There are two basic approaches towards role engi-
neering: top-down and bottom-up. Under the top-down
approach, roles are deﬁned by carefully analyzing and
decomposing business processes into smaller units in
a functionally independent manner. Since this is a co-
operative process that requires various authorities from
different disciplines understand the semantics of busi-
ness processes of one another, it is often quite expensive.
In contrast, the bottom-up approach utilizes the existing
permission assignments to formulate roles. It may also
be advantageous to use a mixture of the top-down and
the bottom-up approaches to conduct role engineering.
While the top-down approach is likely to ignore the
existing permissions, a bottom-up model may not con-
sider business functions of an organization [8], but has
the advantage of automating the role engineering pro-
cess. As a result, there have been several attempts
to propose good bottom-up techniques to ﬁnding roles
[9, 12, 17, 4, 2]. However, an inherent problem with
all of the above approaches is that there is no formal
notion of goodness/interestingness of a role. Recently,
[13] has formally deﬁned the role mining problem, and
has analyzed its theoretical bounds.
[13] shows that
the decision version of this problem is NP-complete by
reducing the known NP-complete set basis problem to
this. A variant of this problem that minimizes the num-
ber of user-to-role and role-to-permission assignments
has been studied by Ene et al. [4], Zhang et al. [2],
and Vaidya et al. [16]. These optimizations are desir-
able since they minimize the administrative burden by
reducing the number of roles. An alternative role min-
ing problem, denoted as the minimal perturbation RMP
[15], whose goal is to discover the optimal set of roles
1We count the edges involved with dummy super roles. However,
those edges will not affect the conclusion, since even we don’t count
them, one solutions is still superior to the other
that are as close to the currently deployed roles, has been
recently deﬁned. This helps organizations to migrate to a
new set of optimal roles without having to disrupt much
of their processes, and provides a formal means of opti-
mally merging their respective roles when two or more
organizations merge.
While all the above proposals attempt to discover a
set of roles with a certain optimality notion, they do not
discover hierarchies. Molloy et al. [10] have proposed
an approach using formal concept analysis for role hier-
archy construction. The greedy algorithm called hierar-
chical Miner starts from an initial role hierarchy where
each user is assigned exactly one user and one permis-
sion is assigned to exactly one role. It uses a heuristic
solution for the optimality, according to weighted struc-
tural complexity. Local pruning or restructuring will be
performed iteratively over each of all the roles if the cost
of the RBAC state at it could be reduced. The weighted
structural complexity sums up the the number of rela-
tionships in which each of the different relationships is
assigned a different weight. These relationships could
be the roles generated, the user-role assignments (U A),
the role-permission assignments (P A), the transitive re-
duction of role-hierarchy and the direct user-permission
assignments (U P A). The optimality is deﬁned as the
smallest weighted structural complexity. One major dif-
ference between this paper and ours is that they do not
provide a formal means to optimize the role hierarchy,
but eliminate the nodes with no users and/or no per-
missions, and remove edges that are redundant due to
transitivity. Another difference between their optimal
objective and ours is that our optimality is solely deter-
mined by the combination of the number of roles and
the transitive reduction of the role hierarchy. We ex-
clude the U A and role-permission assignment P A when
deﬁning optimality since we argue that role hierarchy al-
ready fully incorporates the information represented by
U A and P A combined. Consideration of both into op-
timal measurement will be redundant and unnecessary.
We also did not include the direct U P A since under the
role-based access control the users and permissions are
completely decoupled. If we allow direct assignment of
permission to users, we will obscure the boundary on
when we should use roles and when we should use di-
rect assignment of permissions to users. Moreover, we
do not encourage the direct user permission assignments
since it defeats the purpose of RBAC.

Role hierarchies are inherent to the role based ac-
cess control model as they further ease the burden of

Figure 4. An example showing the difference between the optimal hierarchy and the hierarchy
generated by RH-Miner
security administration. While there exist many solu-
tions to come up with role hierarchies, there does not ex-
ist the notion of an optimal role hierarchy, which helps
maximize the beneﬁt of having one. In this paper, we
have formally deﬁned the role hierarchy mining problem
(RHMP). Essentially, our approach is based on viewing
the role hierarchy as a graph and ﬁnding the optimal role
hierarchy as that of computing the transitive closure with
minimum number of edges. Our heuristic solution is
built on the recently proposed RoleMiner solution [17].
In the future, we plan enhance the optimal role and hi-
erarchy computation with semantics by considering the
semantics of the objects and their attributes. This will
help to discover more meaningful roles. Additionally,
we plan to evaluate the proposed approach in this paper
as well as that proposed in [10] against our formal met-
ric using both simulated and real data sets. We will also
develop solutions for the MinPert RHMP, which is likely
to be of the most use to organizations.
