Question: "What are the advantages and potential limitations of using HMAC-DRBG as a pseudorandom number generator? Select all that apply."
 "A": "HMAC-DRBG can accept an arbitrary long initial seed, which accommodates seeds with lower entropy by using more bits to achieve adequate entropy levels."
 "B": "The addition of non-entropic strings such as a string of 0 bits can deteriorate the entropy quality of HMAC-DRBG's internal state."
 "C": "HMAC-DRBG's reliance on HMAC ensures that the output is indistinguishable from random, as long as the internal state remains secret."
 "D": "Rollback resistance is a limitation of HMAC-DRBG because if the previous state can be computed from the current state, it indicates a reversal of the underlying hash function."
Answer: AC
