I am currently using CentOS 7 with Anaconda 2. After updating the `matplotlib` package via `conda`, I encountered an issue when trying to import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`. The Python interpreter throws the following error:

```
This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "xcb".
Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
```

I attempted to resolve the issue by removing and reinstalling the `pyqt` package, but this did not help. Ultimately, I had to completely uninstall and then reinstall Anaconda to fix the problem.

Is there a more efficient or better way to address this issue without having to reinstall the entire Anaconda environment?
