I am using CentOS 7 and Anaconda 2. Recently, I updated the matplotlib package
using `conda`, if I type  
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, the python interpreter will complain about
> This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt
> platform plugin "xcb".  
>  Reinstalling the application may fix this problem
I tried to remove `pyqt` and then reinstall the package, but that does not
help. Finally I have to remove the  
entire Anaconda install and reinstall Anaconda.
Is there a better way to solve this problem?
