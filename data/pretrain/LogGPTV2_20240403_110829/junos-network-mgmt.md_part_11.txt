### Control of TLV Transmission in CCM PDUs

The transmission of the Interface Status TLV in Continuity Check Messages (CCMs) can be controlled through configuration at the continuity-check level. This configuration is not mandated by IEEE 802.1ag but is provided to offer more flexibility to the operator. The Junos OS will receive and process CCMs with the Interface Status TLV, regardless of this configuration.

#### Configuration Example

The configuration for the Interface Status TLV is as follows:

```plaintext
protocols {
    oam {
        ethernet {
            connectivity-fault-management {
                maintenance-domain identifier {
                    level number;
                    maintenance-association identifier {
                        continuity-check {
                            interval number;
                            loss-threshold number;
                            hold-interval number;
                            interface-status-tlv;  # Enables the Interface Status TLV
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** The Junos OS supports the transmission of only three out of the seven possible values for the Interface Status TLV: 1, 2, and 7. However, it can receive any value for the Interface Status TLV.

### Displaying the Received Interface Status TLV

The Junos OS saves the last received Interface Status TLV from the remote MEP. If the received Interface Status value does not correspond to one of the standard values listed in Table 11 on page 92, the `show` command displays "unknown."

You can display the last saved Interface Status TLV using the following command:

```plaintext
user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain <identifier> maintenance-association <identifier> local-mep <identifier> remote-mep <identifier>
```

**Example:**

```plaintext
user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain md5 maintenance-association ma5 local-mep 2001 remote-mep 1001
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Maintenance domain name: md5, Format: string, Level: 5
Maintenance association name: ma5, Format: string
Continuity-check status: enabled, Interval: 100ms, Loss-threshold: 3 frames
MEP identifier: 2001, Direction: down, MAC address: 00:19:e2:b2:81:4a
Auto-discovery: enabled, Priority: 0
Interface status TLV: up, Port status TLV: up
Interface name: ge-2/0/0.0, Interface status: Active, Link status: Up
Remote MEP identifier: 1001, State: ok
MAC address: 00:19:e2:b0:74:00, Type: Learned
Interface: ge-2/0/0.0
Last flapped: Never
Remote defect indication: false
Port status TLV: none
Interface status TLV: none  # Displays the Interface Status TLV state
```

### Displaying the Transmitted Interface Status TLV

The Junos OS also saves the last transmitted Interface Status TLV from a local MEP. If the transmission of the Interface Status TLV has not been enabled, the `show` command displays "none."

You can display the last transmitted Interface Status TLV using the same command as above:

```plaintext
user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain <identifier> maintenance-association <identifier> local-mep <identifier> remote-mep <identifier>
```

**Example:**

```plaintext
user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain md5 maintenance-association ma5 local-mep 2001 remote-mep 1001
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Maintenance domain name: md5, Format: string, Level: 5
Maintenance association name: ma5, Format: string
Continuity-check status: enabled, Interval: 100ms, Loss-threshold: 3 frames
MEP identifier: 2001, Direction: down, MAC address: 00:19:e2:b2:81:4a
Auto-discovery: enabled, Priority: 0
Interface status TLV: up, Port status TLV: up
Interface name: ge-2/0/0.0, Interface status: Active, Link status: Up
Remote MEP identifier: 1001, State: ok
MAC address: 00:19:e2:b0:74:00, Type: Learned
Interface: ge-2/0/0.0
Last flapped: Never
Remote defect indication: false
Port status TLV: none
Interface status TLV: none
```

### MAC Status Defects

The Junos OS provides information about MAC status defects, indicating that one or more remote MEPs are reporting a failure in their Port Status TLV or Interface Status TLV. It indicates "yes" if either some remote MEP is reporting that its interface is not `isUp` (e.g., at least one remote MEP's interface is unavailable), or if all remote MEPs are reporting a Port Status TLV that contains a value other than `psUp` (e.g., all remote MEPs' Bridge Ports are not forwarding data).

There are two `show` commands you can use to view the MAC Status Defects indication:

1. **Using the `mep-database` command:**

   ```plaintext
   user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain <identifier> maintenance-association <identifier>
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```plaintext
   user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain md6 maintenance-association ma6
   ```

   **Output:**

   ```plaintext

2. **Using the `interfaces` command:**

   ```plaintext
   user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management interfaces detail
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```plaintext

### Configuring Remote MEP Action Profile Support

Based on the values of the `interface-status-tlv` and `port-status-tlv` in the received CCM packets, specific actions such as `interface-down` can be triggered using the `action-profile` options. Multiple action profiles can be configured on the router, but only one action profile can be assigned to a remote MEP. An action profile can be configured with at least one event to trigger the action, and the action will be triggered if any one of these events occurs.

An action profile can be applied only at the remote MEP level.

**Configuration Example:**

```plaintext
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
action-profile tlv-action {
    event {
        # If interface status TLV with value specified in the config is received
        interface-status-tlv down|lower-layer-down;
        # If port status TLV with value specified in the config is received
        port-status-tlv blocked;
        # If connectivity is lost to the peer
        adjacency-loss;
    }
    action {
        # Bring the interface down
        interface-down;
    }
    default-actions interface-down;
}

# Domains
maintenance-domain <identifier> {
    # Maintenance domain level (0-7)
    level <number>;
    # Association
    maintenance-association <identifier> {
        mep <identifier> {
            interface ge-x/y/z.w;
            remote-mep <identifier> {
                # Apply the action-profile for the remote MEP
                action-profile tlv-action;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Monitoring a Remote MEP Action Profile

You can use the `show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database` command to view the action profile status of a remote MEP.

**Example:**

```plaintext
user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain md5 maintenance-association ma5 remote-mep 200
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Maintenance domain name: md5, Format: string, Level: 5
Maintenance association name: ma5, Format: string
Continuity-check status: enabled, Interval: 1s, Loss-threshold: 3 frames
MEP identifier: 100, Direction: down, MAC address: 00:05:85:73:e8:ad
Auto-discovery: enabled, Priority: 0
Interface status TLV: none, Port status TLV: none  # Last status TLVs transmitted by the router
Interface name: ge-1/0/8.0, Interface status: Active, Link status: Up
Remote MEP identifier: 200, State: ok  # Displays the remote MEP name and state
MAC address: 00:05:85:73:96:1f, Type: Configured
Interface: ge-1/0/8.0
Last flapped: Never
Remote defect indication: false
Port status TLV: none
Interface status TLV: lower-layer-down
Action profile: juniper  # Displays remote MEP’s action profile identifier
Last event: Interface-status-tlv lower-layer-down  # Last remote MEP event to trigger action
Action: Interface-down, Time: 2009-03-27 14:25:10 PDT (00:00:02 ago)  # Action occurrence time
```

### Configuring Chassis ID TLV

In Release 16.1R2 and later, you can configure the Junos OS to send the sender ID TLV along with CCM, loopback, and Link Trace Messages (LTMs) as specified in the IEEE 802.1ag standard. The sender ID TLV contains the chassis ID, which is the unique, CFM-based MAC address of the device, and the management IP address, which can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

The value of the length field in the TLV indicates whether or not the TLV contains the chassis ID information. The possible values for the length field are zero (0) or any valid number, which indicates the absence or presence of chassis ID information in the TLV, respectively.

**Global Configuration:**

```plaintext
set protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management sendid-tlv send-chassis-tlv
```

If the sender ID TLV is configured at the global level, the default maintenance domain, maintenance association, and the maintenance association intermediate point (MIP) half function inherit this configuration.

**Hierarchy Level Configuration:**

- `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]`
- `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain <maintenance-domain-name> maintenance-association <maintenance-association-name> continuity-check]`

The sender ID TLV configuration at the maintenance-association level takes precedence over the global-level configuration.

**Note:** The sender ID TLV is supported only for 802.1ag PDUs and is not supported for performance monitoring protocol data units (PDUs).

### Configuring MAC Flush Message Processing in CET Mode

In carrier Ethernet transport (CET) mode, MX Series routers are used as provider edge (PE) routers, and Nokia Siemens Networks A2200 Carrier Ethernet Switches (referred to as E-domain devices) that run standard-based protocols are used in the access side. On the MX Series routers, VPLS pseudowires are configured dynamically through label distribution protocol (LDP). On the E-domain devices, topology changes are detected through connectivity fault management (CFM) sessions running between the E-domain devices and the MX Series PE routers. The MX Series PE routers can bring the carrier Ethernet interface down if there is CFM connectivity loss, triggering a local MAC flush and a targeted label distribution protocol (T-LDP) MAC flush notification to the remote MX Series PEs.

In CET inter-op mode, MX Series routers need to interoperate with the Nokia Siemens Networks Ax100 Carrier Ethernet access devices (referred to as A-domain devices) that run legacy protocols. Nokia Siemens Networks A4100 and A8100 devices act as intermediaries between the MX Series PE routers and A-domain devices, performing interworking function (IWF) procedures so that OAM sessions can be run between MX Series routers and A-domain devices. There are no VPLS pseudowires between the MX Series PE routers and the Nokia Siemens Networks A4100 and A8100 intermediate devices, so there is no LDP protocol running between the PE routers to send topology change notifications. To communicate topology changes, MX Series routers can trigger a MAC flush and propagate it in the core using action profiles based on the connection protection type length value (TLV) event. The action profile brings down the carrier edge logical interface in MX Series PE routers, which triggers a local MAC flush and propagates the topology change to the core using LDP notification.

For VPLS, there is no end-to-end connectivity monitored. Access rings are independently monitored by running CFM down multiple end points (MEPs) on the working and protection paths for each of the services between the E-domain devices and the MX Series PE routers, and between the A-domain devices and the MX Series PE routers, the IWF hosted by the Nokia Siemens Networks A-4100 devices. When there is a connectivity failure on the working path, the Nokia Siemens Networks Ax200 devices perform a switchover to the protection path, triggering a topology change notification (in the form of TLVs carried in CCM) to be sent on the active path.

#### Topology Examples

1. **Dual Homed Topology:**

   - Figure 7 on page 102 describes the dual homed topology on MX Series PE routers connected to the A-domain.
   - When an A-domain device triggers a switchover, it starts switching the service traffic to the new active path. This change is communicated in the HELLO protocol data units (PDUs) sent by that A-domain device on the working and protection paths.
   - When the IWF in A4100 receives these HELLO PDUs, it converts them to standard CCM messages and inserts a connection protection TLV. The "Protection-in-use" field of the connection protection TLV is encoded with the currently active path and included in the CCM message.
   - CCM messages are received by the MX Series PE routers through the VLAN spoke in A4100. In the dual homed scenario, one MX Series PE router monitors the working path, and the other MX Series PE router monitors the protection path.
   - A MAC flush occurs when the CFM session that is monitoring the working path detects that the service traffic has moved to the protection path or when the CFM session that is monitoring the protection path detects that the service traffic has moved to the working path.

2. **Dual Attached Topology:**

   - Figure 8 on page 103 describes the dual attached topology on MX Series PE routers connected to the A-domain.
   - The MAC flush mechanism used in this case is the same as the one used for the A-domain in the dual homed scenario. However, in this case, both CFM sessions are hosted by only one MX Series PE router.
   - When Ax100 in the A-domain detects topology changes, the MX Series PE router receives the connection protection TLV in the CCM message for the working and protection paths with the value of "Protection-in-use" indicating which path is the active one.
   - Based on the event generated for the CFM session, the MX Series PE router will bring down the appropriate interface, triggering a local MAC flush.

### Configuring a Connection Protection TLV Action Profile

An action profile can be configured to perform the `interface-down` action based on the values of the `connection-protection-tlv` in the received CCM packets.

**Configuration Example:**

```plaintext
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
action-profile  {
    event {
        # If a connection protection TLV with a “Protection-in-use” value of SET is received
        connection-protection-tlv ;
        # If a connection protection TLV with a “Protection-in-use” value of RESET is received
        connection-protection-tlv ;
    }
    action {
        # Bring the interface down
        interface-down;
    }
}
```

### Example: Configuring an Action Profile Based on Connection Protection TLVs

This example shows how to configure an action profile based on the connection protection TLV for the purposes of triggering MAC flushes based on topology changes in a CET network.

#### Requirements

- Junos OS Release 11.2 or later
- An MX series PE router

#### Overview and Topology

- **Topology:**
  - Figure 9 on page 105 shows the physical topology of a CET network using MX series PE routers.
  - Definitions:
    - **Provider edge (PE) device:** A device, or set of devices, at the edge of the provider network that presents the provider's view of the customer site.
    - **E-domain:** Nokia Siemens Networks Carrier Ethernet Switches that run standard-based protocols and are used in the access side.
    - **A-domain:** Nokia Siemens Networks Carrier Ethernet Switches that run legacy protocols.

#### Configuration

**Step-by-Step Procedure:**

1. Configure an action profile:

   ```plaintext
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
   action-profile  {
       event {
           # If the connection protection TLV is received with a “Protection-in-use” value of SET
           connection-protection-tlv ;
           # If the connection protection TLV is received with a “Protection-in-use” value of RESET
           connection-protection-tlv ;
       }
       action {
           # Bring the interface down
           interface-down;
       }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor the transmission and reception of TLVs in your network, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
