 **Current behavior:** When using the "Override Windows Snap shortcut (Win +
Arrow) to move windows between zones" the current application remains the
active window.
**Prefered behavior:** When using the "Override Windows Snap shortcut (Win +
Arrow) to move windows between zones" any application in the 'current' zone
become the active window.
Here is a paint drawing, to make it more clear:

Consider the following:  
Situation 1 is the situation before using the shortcut to move windows between
zones. Let's say Application A (in zone 1) is currently active.
Situation 2  
Windows have been moved between zones. In the current situation Application A
would still be active, regardless of in which zone it resides.
I would prefer to make whatever now is in Zone 1 (Application C in this case)
active. This would enhance my workflow a lot and it seems more intuitive to
me.
