**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Limit Access to Resources Over the Network

To enhance network security, consider creating static ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) entries for networked devices. This practice can help prevent unauthorized access by ensuring that only known and trusted devices can communicate with each other. However, implementing static ARP entries may be impractical for large networks due to the complexity and administrative overhead involved.
