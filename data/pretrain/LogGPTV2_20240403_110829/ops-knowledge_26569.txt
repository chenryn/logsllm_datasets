User: I just started using Google App Engine and I am very new to Python. I may have made a stupid mistake or a fatal error, I don't know, but I realized that the basic "template" I downloaded from a website was old and used Python 2.5.
So, I decided to update to Python 2.7 (after recieving a warning in the site's dashboard).
I have no idea how to do this, but I blindly followed some instructions on how to update but I'm not sure what I did wrong.
I know that I downloaded Python 2.7 (as the download path is C:/Python27/), so there shouldn't be a problem there. Can anybody tell what I'm doing wrong?
Assistant: I'm not sure if this is your formatting when you loaded your code here, but where you define app in main.py should not be part of the contacts class. If it is, your reference to main.app in your app.yaml won't work and your page won't load.
