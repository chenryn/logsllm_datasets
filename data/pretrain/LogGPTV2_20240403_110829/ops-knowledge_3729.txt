User:  How to check disk space and memory usage of server? Please provide commands and explanations.
Assistant: Check disk space: 1. The df command The df command is used to display the statistical information of the disk usage status of the file system. Run the command without parameters, and display information such as the total file system, remaining, usage, and mount points. For example: ``` df -h ``` The -h parameter is used to display the displayed disk usage in a human-readable way (such as GB, MB). As shown below: ![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/2168568/1631352812799-79cf32b9-434a-4f34-bd6b-58c6205e0386.png#clientId=u3ee93199- 2ada-4&from=paste&height=308&id=u4466b414&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=308&originWidth=736&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=31063&status=done&style=none&taskId=u35eee 796-e9ab-4b73-8b95-a8a601c1dfc&width=736) of which the first Column indicates the name of the device where the file system is located; the second column is the point where the file system is mounted; the third column shows the total size of the file system; the fourth column shows the size of the used space; the fifth column shows the remaining free space; the last column is Occupancy ratio of the file system size. 2. The du command The du command can be used to estimate the disk space usage. When using this command, you need to specify a specific directory or file. For example, to view the size of files and directories contained in each subdirectory under the current directory, you can run the following command: ``` du -sh * ``` The -s parameter means to display only the total size of a specific directory or file; -h means to use Display disk usage in an easy-to-read way; * indicates all subdirectories under the current directory. As shown below: ![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/2168568/1631352847241-50b8e9f3-a3ce-4ee9-ba1c-62b1a6f7029e.png#clientId=u3ee93199- 2ada-4&from=paste&height=200&id=u399de6d6&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=200&originWidth=349&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=10730&status=done&style=none&taskId=u75104 9a7-a423-41f4-8ce0-bb77cf58cf8&width=349) run here The command outputs the size of each subdirectory under the current directory in an easy-to-read manner, and the unit is KB, MB, GB, etc. Check memory usage: 1. free command The free command is used to display memory usage. When running the command without parameters, it will display the total, used, idle and occupied but exchangeable (ie remaining) memory size of the system. For example: ``` free -h ``` The -h parameter will display the data in the output result in the form of KB, MB, GB, etc. As shown below: ![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/2168568/1631352901950-62810044-bd04-4711-97cb-a5913808e243.png#clientId=u3ee93199- 2ada-4&from=paste&height=61&id=u7269d4ec&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png&originHeight=61&originWidth=724&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=5506&status=done&style=none&taskId=u8c70cde9- cba4-4fca-a43a-d1ce91e73bb&width=724) among them the first The first row represents physical memory, and the second row represents the swap partition (swap). 2. top command The top command can dynamically display the process status of the system, including CPU usage and memory usage. After running the top command, enter the M command to sort by the memory usage, so as to view the processes with large memory usage. For example: ``` top ``` and enter M to sort by memory usage, as shown in the figure below: ![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/2168568 /1631352956921-1f2639d2-126d-4a1b-94e9-3aa7c3c0b010.png#clientId=u3ee93199-2ada-4&from=paste&height=324&id=u08dc1e0f&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&name=image.png& originHeight=324&originWidth=914&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=38845&status= done&style=none&taskId=u0ab53ca2-75d5-4e87-b697-379d5d78d17&width=914) At this time, the processes in the list will be sorted according to the memory usage from large to small, and the MEM in the first line is the amount of memory occupied by the process.
