User: I'd like to give to each of my customers access to their own bucket under my GCS enabled app. 
I also need to make sure that a user's bucket is safe from other users' actions. 
Last but not least, the customer will be a client application, so the whole process needs to be done transparently without asking the user to login.
If I apply an ACL on each bucket, granting access only to the user I want, can I create an API key only for that bucket and hand that API key to the client app to perform GCS API calls?
Assistant: Unfortunately you only have two good options here:

Have a service which authenticates the individial app according to whatever scheme you like (some installation license, a random GUID assigned at creation time, whatever) and vends GCS signed URLs, which the end user could then use for a single operation, like uploading an object or listing a bucket's content. The downside here is that all requests must involve your service. All resources would belong entirely to your application.
Abandon the "without asking the user to login" requirement and require a single Google login at install time.
