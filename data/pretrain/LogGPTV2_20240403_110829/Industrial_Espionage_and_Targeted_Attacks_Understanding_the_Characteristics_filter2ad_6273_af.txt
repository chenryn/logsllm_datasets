Fig. 11. First and last detection time of the droppers/droppees in WINE compared to the ﬁrst and
last day of the targeted attacks
the attack is being observed in the wild), there are also some campaigns that reuse old
malware to perform the subsequent stages of the targeted attack.
In the previous sections, we have shown that targeted attacks employ a wide range of
vulnerabilities. While some exploit old vulnerabilities (i.e., disclosed in 2009 or 2010),
approximately 50% of them exploit vulnerabilities that were disclosed in 2011. Since
we performed our analysis on data collected in 2011, it is possible that some of the tar-
geted attacks were actually zero-day attacks. A zero-day is deﬁned to be an attack that
involves exploitation of a vulnerability that is still not publicly disclosed at the time of
the attack [1]. To identify the campaigns that might have performed zero-day attacks, we
compared their attack window with the disclosure date of the vulnerability they exploit.
As a result, eight campaigns started on average 16 days before the disclosure date; there-
fore, the attacks involved in those campaigns were apparently exploiting unknown vul-
nerabilities at that time (i.e., CVE-2011-0609, CVE-2011-0611 and CVE-2011-2462),
and thus we can safely conclude that the attackers were using zero-day attacks.
To the best of our knowledge, the remaining of the campaigns did not perform zero-
day attacks. However, attackers reacted very fast to deploy new exploits during their
attack campaign. Indeed, most of them started exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities just a
few days after the disclosure date.
The campaigns we have identiﬁed in this paper are associated with a number of dif-
ferent droppers during their lifetime. Attackers can create different droppers over time,
either to evade malware detection systems by applying polymorphism, or to increase
their effectiveness by adding new exploitation methods as new vulnerabilities are being
disclosed (e.g., Taidoor attacks). However, a majority of the campaigns do not up-
date their droppees over time or do not apply polymorphism at that stage. The graph in
Figure 12 shows that for almost 70% of the campaigns, a dropper downloads exactly
the same droppees, i.e., trojans or backdoors that are shared with other droppers used
within the same campaign.

As explained in Section 2, in a typical targeted attack scenario, the attackers ﬁrst at-
tempt to compromise the victim to install a backdoor or a trojan such that in later stages
of the attack, data exﬁltration can be realized. To ﬁnd out whether the targeted attacks
we analyzed always follow the same lifecyle, as a ﬁnal experiment we have identiﬁed
the threat categories that droppers and droppees fall into. Figure 13(a) illustrates that the
majority of the droppers fall into the Trojan or backdoor category. Therefore, it is fair
to conclude that, after the exploitation phase, most malicious attachments downloaded
another malicious binary that aims at installing a backdoor program. On the other hand,
only one quarter of the droppees were trojans or backdoors. This shows that some of
the campaigns reuse old malware and perform other malicious activities, in addition to
exﬁltrating sensitive information from the targeted organization.

6 Conclusion
Targeted attacks are still rare occurrences today compared to classical malware attacks,
which are usually more proﬁt-oriented and performed on a much larger-scale. However,
this type of attacks can be extremely difﬁcult to defend against and has the potential to
seriously impact an organization. In the longer-term, targeted attacks and APTs repre-
sent a signiﬁcant threat against the economic prosperity of many companies and against
the digital assets of governmental organizations, as demonstrated by the recent high
proﬁle attacks that made the headlines in 2010-2011.
To understand the real nature of targeted attacks and how those attacks are being
orchestrated by motivated and well resourced teams of attackers, we have conducted
an in-depth analysis of 18,580 email attacks that were identiﬁed as targeted by Syman-
tec.cloud during the year 2011. Using advanced TRIAGE data analytics, we were able
to attribute series of targeted attacks to attack campaigns likely performed by the same
individuals. By analyzing the characteristics and dynamics of those attack campaigns,
we have provided new insights into the modus operandi of the attackers involved in
various series of targeted attacks launched against industries and governmental organi-
zations. Our research has clearly demonstrated that a targeted attack is rarely a single
attack, but instead that attackers are often determined and patient, as they usually per-
form long-running campaigns which can sometimes go on for months while they target
in turn different organizations and adapt their techniques.
We also showed that about 2/3rd of attack campaigns were highly focused and tar-
geting only a limited number of organizations within the same activity Sector (such
as the SYKIPOT attacks), whereas 1/3rd of the campaigns were ﬁtting the proﬁle of a
Massive Organizationally Targeted Attack (MOTA) – i.e., targeting a large number of
organizations across multiple sectors (like in the NITRO and TAIDOOR attacks).
Finally, we have evaluated the prevalence and sophistication level of the targeted
attacks in our dataset by analyzing the malicious attachments used as droppers. While
a large deal of the attacks are apparently relying more on social engineering, have a
low level of sophistication and use little obfuscation, our malware analysis also showed
that, in at least eight attack campaigns, attackers were using zero-day exploits against
unknown vulnerabilities which were disclosed two weeks after the date of the ﬁrst series
of attacks observed for those campaigns.
