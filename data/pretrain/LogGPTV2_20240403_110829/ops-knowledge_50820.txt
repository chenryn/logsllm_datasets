User: In Python, what is the shortest and the standard way of calling a command through subprocess but not bothering with its output.
I tried subprocess.call however it seems to return the output. I am not bothered with that, I just need to run the program silently without the output cluttering up the screen.
If it helps, I am callling pdflatex and my intention is just to call it.
Assistant: just call it as you are and tack >/dev/null on the end of the comamnd. That will redirect any textual output.
