ASes that do not transmit any non-compliant path in
our experiment and could possibly ﬁlter or de-prefer
the non-compliant paths. This can be considered as an
upper bound of the measurement. The third case is
a subset of the second one: An AS qualiﬁes for this
category if we have evidence that it follows ROA for
both preﬁxes in both time frames. Therefore the AS is
very likely to ﬁlter BGP announcements according to
ROV results or it can solely depend on an upstream
AS that satisﬁes this condition. This category can be
considered as a lower bound ROV acting AS. Manual
analysis is then needed to remove false positives in ROV
upstream dependents. The fourth case is a subset of
the second and a superset of the third. It selects ASNs
that we have no negative evidence about and there is a
positive evidence that shows that the AS ﬁlters ROAs
for at least one preﬁx in each measurement period.
This category is deﬁned because the requirements for
the third one proved to be excessively strict. The third
case requires the validating AS to receive the valid
path for each preﬁx, which is not assured nor expected
in all cases and therefore it generates false negatives.
Thus we introduced the relaxed criteria (4) that helps
us overcome this limitation.
The criteria are crafted to work with the two mea-
surement rounds that are using the same preﬁxes and
reversed ROAs to minimize possibility of false positives.
There are still unpredictable factors, such as trafﬁc
engineering, that contribute to the path selection and
certain combinations can accidentally select valid paths.
However, it is unlikely to happen twice in short time
periods and also to correctly react on reversing ROAs.
B. Data Analysis and Results
The presented results are consolidated and processed,
and element counts of the previously explained groups
are derived from RouteViews and RIPE RIS MRT
dumps. The procedure involved downloading the MRT
dumps after more than 24 hours after the ﬁrst pub-
lication of ROAs and after injection of the preﬁxes
from both origin sources and after the subsequent ROA
changes. We repeated the analysis 3 times with variable
delay among attempts and no signiﬁcant difference has
been detected in the entire result set.
The observed categories yielded following counts:
• Observed paths for both beacon preﬁxes: 696
• Total ASNs in the observed AS-paths: 296
• AS ROV categories:
(1) No validation (negative evidence): 250 (84.5%)
(2) Possible validation (upper bound): 46 (15.5%)
(3) Proved validation: 0
(4) Probable validation: 4 (1.35%)
The small scale and coverage limitation of this ap-
proach apparently affected the results and generated a
low number of observed ASes. The reason lies in the
637
routing concentration in the Internet - most of the paths
take route through a limited number of core ASes. Since
the experiment was based on a ﬁxed beginning of the
paths, the only unique part in most of them was the
ending of the path. However, the vantage points have
in certain cases multiple peerings with one end ASN,
which decreases the observation diversity of 696 paths
to only 296 unique ASNs in combined AS-paths.
In contrast the coverage limitation could introduce
positive bias. Arguably, the reason for obtaining fa-
vorable percentage of probable validating autonomous
systems lies in the fact
the ASes that sponsor
peerings with the vantage points count among the most
progressive and technologically developed places in the
Internet.
that
Moreover, control-plane analysis is affected by a
known fundamental limitation: Route servers in most
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) do not include their
ASN in AS-path and therefore a credit for dropping in-
valid preﬁxes might be given to the ﬁrst AS downstream
even though the ﬁltering happens on the route server. In
this case the ROV observation might be also lost if the
downstream AS generates a negative evidence point as
well.
IV. Traceroute Probes from RIPE Atlas
The most signiﬁcant ﬂaw of the control-plane analysis
is limited visibility due to the low number of vantage
points and thus insufﬁcient Internet coverage. We strive
to obtain representative data for the entire Internet.
To employ more remote observation points we include
a data-plane measurement. The method of choice for
getting structurally similar data as in the control-plane
measurement
is remotely executed traceroute. RIPE
Atlas [25] platform has been selected in order to run
traceroute on several thousands remote points and col-
lect the results in a uniform and machine-readable way.
A. Experimental Evaluation
Taking advantage of RIPE Atlas allows us to expand
our experiment to more than 7.700 remote points. Figure
2 illustrates the setup of our experimental evaluation.
Two consecutive traceroute runs are executed on each
probe in our testing set. The ﬁrst traceroute is directed
−→
to an IP address from the preﬁx P1 and the second one
T ≡ (t1,t2, . . . ,tn) contains
to P2. Each traceroute result
a lists of IP addresses that can be translated to a path
Π = (p, (A(t1),A(t2), . . . ,A(tn)) where p is the preﬁx of
traceroute destination and A(t) is symbol for resolving
ASN for the router IP address t. With the derived path
for each traceroute result we create a set of all obtained
virtual paths X(cid:10)
P1,P2 and apply the reasoning from the
previous section on these paths.
• Probes utilized in both time frames: 7730
• Identical path pairs: 7554 (97.7%)
• Different path pairs: 137 (1.8%)
• Incomplete pairs: 39 (0.5%)
The path pairs have been resolved to virtual AS-
paths and the analysis identical to the control-plane
measurement has been conducted. It yielded following
AS ROV categories:
(1) No validation (negative evidence): 2043 (97.0%)
(2) Possible validation (upper bound): 49 (2.3%)
(3) Proved validation: 2 (0.1%)
(4) Probable validation: 12 (0.5%)
V. TCP SYN+ACK Capture
The control-plane measurement is limited by the low
number of vantage points and low number of their
peers, ranging in several hundreds. The RIPE Atlas
measurement extended this range to a few thousand in-
dependent viewpoints. To extend the experiment further
and measure ROV in larger portion of the Internet we
perform active probing of servers.
A. Experimental Evaluation
The method is based on sending TCP connection
initiation segments. Destination IP addresses are taken
from 1.25M-top Alexa [23] top websites. The original
list has been reduced to approximately 677K unique
IP addresses suitable for the experiment. We call them
d1,d2, ...,dN. Two distinct TCP SYN segment probes are
sent to each destination di. A speciﬁc source IP address
that lies in preﬁx P1 is used for the ﬁrst probe and an
IP address from P2 for the second probe. Our list of
destinations contains mostly HTTP servers and therefore
the probes are sent to a destination port 80/tcp to
maximize the number of replies we get from the remote
hosts. The TCP SYN+ACK replies from the destinations
di are sent and routed to the probe source IP addresses
in the preﬁxes P1 and P2. We capture the TCP reply
segments as they are routed towards the probe source
IP addresses into the ASes A1 or A2 and we identify
the probe destination, the reply receiving ASN and the
probe source IP preﬁx. The desired coverage extension
comes at a price of limited routing information that is
extracted from each individual measurement. To reliably
resolve a routing path that the reply packets take we
have to adjust the objective of the experiment: We ﬁnd
destinations that beneﬁt from the ﬁltering provided by
ROV to determine the number of protected sites in our
destination set, instead of trying to identify individual
ASes implementing ROV as in the two previous cases.
Figure 4 shows the routing patterns for the probe replies.
It follows the path propagation difference scheme and
exploits the equal idea as in the previous two sections.
Fig. 2: RIPE Atlas traceroute experiment
The main difference lies in data acquisition and
analysis method that has to be adapted for larger scale
and for more signiﬁcant noise level in traceroute data.
However, the expected number of ASNs meeting the
previously set criteria is still low. Thus, the results can
be still manually checked, false positives removed and
the positive results veriﬁed with the AS administrators
or from external sources.
B. Data Analysis and Results
The RIPE Atlas results are convoluted from multiple
measurements, that have to be scheduled separately due
to RIPE Atlas restrictions on number of probes and
maximum daily credit. Despite the limitations, it is still
possible to emulate the control-plane measurement to
a great extent. A new aspect in these measurements is
the need for addressing data-plane noise, Atlas probe
failures, misconﬁgured ﬁrewalls or other factors that
cause incomplete or missing traceroute results. Figure
3 illustrates the noise effects, by plotting raw results
of traceroute pairs comparison in a single measurement
round.

Fig. 3: Resolved Atlas pairs
The traceroute probe batches have been sent three
times in each measurement period. The results were
extracted, recombined to form the probe pairs and the
traceroute results were transformed into derived virtual
AS-paths for further categorization. The combined ex-
periment statistics:

∧ v(cid:10)(d,A,ρ) = 0}
(3) Remaining destination IP addresses that do not
fall into any of the previous groups.
The ﬁrst group contains the preﬁxes that responded
to the wrong origin AS at least once in our experiment.
This group contains all destinations that are not pro-
tected by ROV. The second set contains the destinations
for which we have at least two positive evidence points
from two different time frames, hence this set contains
the destinations that are likely to be protected by ROV.
Destinations that do not respond at all, do not respond
to most of our probes or responded randomly falls to
the last group, that can be considered as unknown and
unresolvable.
In this experiment a considerable noise has to be ﬁl-
tered or addressed otherwise. The distortion of observed
routing can be caused by different factors ranging from
load balancing techniques that produce random routing,
trafﬁc engineering, misconﬁguration, network outages
and ongoing changes in the Internet topology. To cancel
out the effects of random packet drops we send multiple
probes to our destinations. The complete measurement
rounds have to be repeated several times with 24 hour
time frame to spot random routing changes. And the
results have to be combined together and ﬁt into the
simplistic scheme outlined by our group deﬁnitions.
B. Data Analysis and Results
The results from the TCP probing are more difﬁcult
to re-combine into pairs and post-process because of a
high number of various errors generated by the data-
plane. Figure 5 shows the number of lost replies and
mismatched packets - replies that have been received
from unknown sources, which were not queried, multi-
ple replies to one probe and incorrect replies in general.

Analysis of the pcap ﬁles according to the method
described above yielded the following groups of the
destination IP addresses:
(1) Unprotected by ROV: 632570 (93.30%)

Even though we rely on the same attributes of BGP
path selection algorithm as in the previous experiments,
the structure and quality of data in this setup are
completely different. The experiment output consist
of pcap ﬁles that contain captured packets with the
destination IP address lying in the preﬁxes P1 and P2.
The ﬁles were obtained from the ASes A1 and A2 in
each measurement time frame ρ1 and ρ2.
