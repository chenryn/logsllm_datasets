        This definition rests on the notion of “informed consent” as 
defined by Aristotle [7]. If there  is any  information about other 
need  a  documentary  evidence.  An  idea  of  privacy  breach 
understood  in  these  terms  thus  remains  very  valid  in  the  era  of 
cloud  computing.  Samuel  Warren’s  and  Louis  Brandies’  1890 
paper  [9],  “The  Right  to  Privacy,”  in  which  they  refer  to  Judge 
Cooley summarizing it as consisting of the right “to be let alone.” 
The  current  establishment  casts  this  as  a  right  to:  Control  over 
information  about  oneself.  It  is  in  this  tradition  of  thought  that 
Alan  Westin  defined  privacy  as  an  individual  right,  held  by  all 
people,  [29]:To  control,  edit,  manage,  and  delete  information 
about  them[selves]  and  decide  when,  how,  and  to  what  extent 
information is communicated to others.  
in the case of multimedia collections, as they could reveal much 
of the user’s personal and social environment.[9] 
        Commonly  users do not  think or are not even aware of the 
risks when they share something online. Based on Das and Sahoo 
(2011)  survey  often  the  decision  about  sharing  something  is 
“made on the moment”, however in todays networked world, the 
next  day  the  content  you  have  shared  is  accessible  to  parents, 
teachers,  employers,  Aware  and  Obama  (2009)  state:  Far  too 
many users believe that their postings on the Internet are private 
between  them  and  the  recipient.  The  reality,  however,  is  that 
once  the  statement  is  typed,  it  can  be  copied,  saved  and 
forwarded.  In  addition,  the  user  no  longer  owns  all  the 
information posted to social networks. “So if you’re using Gmail 
or  Yahoo  mail  or  Flickr  or.  YouTube  or  belong  to  Facebook 
you’ve  given  up complete control of  your personal information’

A.  Types of Privacy issues 
1.  Privacy  concerns  regarding  Social  Media  Sharing 
Services  
        Social  media  sharing  services  are  services,  which  allow  its 
users  to  generate  and  share  different  types  of  content.  Youtube 
and  Vimeo  are  an  example  for  sharing  service  for  video  and 
audio, Instagram and flicker are the ones for sharing photos and 
there are many more. However the aim of this paper is not to go 
in  depth  into  what  kind  of  different  sharing  service  providers, 
platforms,  apps  and  etc.  there  are  on  the  market  but  to  discuss 
about the privacy issues that arise with sharing different kinds of 
content on these networks. 
        Posting Content such as picture and video arise new privacy 
concerns due to their context revealing details about the physical 
and social context of the subject. Ahern, Eckles et al. (2007: 357) 
analysing  the  issue  and  conducting  studies  on  Privacy  Patterns 
and  Considerations  in  online  and  mobile  photo  sharing  claim: 
The growing amount of online personal content exposes users to 
a new set of privacy concerns. Digital cameras, and lately, a new 
class  of  camera  phone  applications  that  can  upload  photos  or 
video  content  directly  to  the  web,  make  publishing  of  personal 
content  increasingly  easy.  Privacy  concerns  are  especially  acute

2.  Privacy concerns regarding Social networking services  
        The following chapter looks into the privacy issues of social 
networking  services.  Social  Networking  sites  as  mentioned 
earlier are the sites aimed for micro-blogging, to document about 
ones 
likings  and  dislikings  and  everyday 
happenings. 
        Susan  B.  Barnes  a  Professor  in  the  Department  of 
Communication at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New 
York claims that in America, people live in a paradoxical world 
of  privacy.  As  we  know  people  will  freely  give  up  personal 
information  to  join  social  networks  on  the  Internet  and  social 
networking  tools  have  almost  become  indispensable  for  them. 
Many people may not be aware of the fact that their privacy has 
already been jeopardized and they are not taking steps to protect 
their personal information from being used by others. [14] 
        Social  networking  sites  (such  as  Facebook,  Orkut)  create  a 
central  repository  of  personal  information.  These  archives  are 
persistent  and  cumulative.  Instead  of  replacing  old  information 
with  new  materials,  online 
journals  are  archive–oriented 
compilations  of  entries  that  can  be  searched.  While  American 
adults are concerned about how the government and corporations 
are  centrally  collecting  data  about  citizens  and  consumers, 
teenagers are freely giving up personal and private information in 
online journals. Adults are concerned about invasion of privacy, 
while  teens  freely  give  up  personal  information.  This  occurs 
because  often  teens  are  not  aware  of  the  public  nature  of  the 
Internet. [14] 
        Facebook  has  met  criticism  on  a  range  of  issues,  including 
online  privacy,  child  safety  and  hate  speech.  The  Electronic 
Frontier  Foundation  has  identified  two  personal  information 
aggregation 
techniques  called  "connections"  and  "instant 
personalization"  that  assure  anyone  has  access  even  to  personal 
information  you  may  not  have  intended  to  be  public.  [15]There 
has been many more privacy issues with Facebook

        Location  based  social  networks  are  part  of  what  is  called 
Location  based  services  (LBS).They  are  made  possible  by 
linking  Global  positioning  system  (GPS),  which  track  user’s 
location, to the capabilities of the World Wide Web, along  with 
other vital features such as instant messaging. [22] 
        Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN) derive from LBSs 
and are often referred to as Geosocial Networking. As reported in 
Microsoft  Research  “a  LBSN  does  not  only  mean  adding  a 
location to an existing social network so that people in the social 
structure  can  share  location-embedded  information,  but  also 
consists  of  the  new  social  structure  made  up  of  individuals 
connected by the interdependency derived from their locations in 
the physical world as well as their location-tagged media content, 
such  as  photos,  video,  and  texts”  [23].Further,  the  connection 
between  users  goes  beyond  sharing  physical  locations  but  also 
involve  sharing  knowledge  like  common  interests,  behaviour, 
and  activities.  Such  pervasive  tools  represent  a  challenge  to 
privacy. 
        LBSN  users  face  the  situation  that  the  information  they 
publish  on  the  such  platforms  could  be  used  to  track  their   
unwanted situations like being the victim of stalking.The Privacy 
advocates  fear  that  Foursquare,  along  with  other  geolocation 
apps    Gowalla  and  Google  Latitude,  are  vulnerable  to  "data 
scraping",  namely,  the  sophisticated  trawling  and  monitoring  of 
user  activity  in  an  effort  to  build  a  rich  database  of  personal 
information.  
        Specifically  the  insurgence  of  applications  designed  to 
function  as  venues  information  aggregators  can  potentially 
represent  a  major  threat  to  privacy  and  LBSN.  Another    issue 
related  to  is  known  as  ‘opt-in’  vs  ‘opt-out’  default  settings.  An 
opt-in scenario refers to having default settings where a platform 
requires user to join or sign up to specific given service in order 
to  receive  the  benefits  of  it.  The  provider  is  then  granted 
permission to access the user's data and to offer the service. 
4.  Sites Convergence 
        A  recent  issue  related  to  privacy  on  today’s  internet  is  the 
that users often have ‘profiles’ and accounts on different site that 
due  to  their  different  nature  a  number  of  information  become 
publicly available that if puzzled together provide a picture of the 
user in certain cases more private that the user would like to be. 
        eg-convergence  of  sites:  Subject  A  is  the  same  as  in

V.  SECURITY 
        In addition to privacy concerns, social networking sites can 
be  used  by  cyber  criminals  to  attack  you  or  your  devices.  Here 
are some steps to protect yourself: 
        1.  Login:  Protect  your  social  networking  account  with  a 
strong  password  and  do  not  share  this  password  with  anyone  or 
re-use it for other sites. In addition, some social networking sites 
support  stronger  authentication,  such  as  two-step  verification. 
Enable stronger authentication methods whenever possible. 
        2.  Encryption:  Many  social  networking  sites  allow  you  to 
use  encryption  called  HTTPS  to  secure  your  connection  to  the 
site.  Some  sites  like  Twitter  and  Google+  have  this  enabled  by 
default,  while  other  sites  require  you  to  manually  enabled 
HTTPS via account settings. Whenever possible use HTTPS. 
        3. Email: Be suspicious of emails that claim to come from a 
social  networking  site;  these  can  easily  be  spoofed  attacks  sent 
by cyber criminals. The safest  way to reply to  such  messages is 
to log in to the website directly, perhaps from a saved bookmark, 
and check any messages or notifications using the website. 
        4.  Malicious  Links/Scams:  Be  cautious  of  suspicious  links 
or  potential  scams  posted  on  social  networking  sites.  Cyber 
criminals can post malicious links and if you click on them, they 
take  you  to  websites  that  attempt  to  infect  your  computer.  In 
addition,  just  because  a  message  is  posted  by  a  friend  does  not 
mean  it  is  from  them,  as  their  account  may  have  been 
compromised.  
        5.  Apps:  Some  social  networking  sites  give  you  the  ability 
to add or install third-party applications, such as games. Keep in 
mind  there  is  little  or  no  quality  control  or  review  of  these 
applications;  they  may  have  full  access  to  your  account  and 
private information.  
A.  Design Flaws and Limitations 
1.Productivity 
        One  reason  why  organizations  on  social  networking  within 
the  geographical  point  is  that  the  incontrovertible  fact  that 
workers  pay  a  good  deal  of  your  time  change  their  profiles  and 
sites  throughout  the  day.  If  each  worker  in  an  exceedingly  50-
strong men spent half-hour on a social networking website daily, 
that  might  compute  to  a  loss  of  half-dozen,500  hours  of 
productivity  in  one  year!  though  this  could  be  a  generalization, 
organizations  look  terribly  rigorously  at  productivity  problems, 
and  twenty  five  hours  of  non-productive  work  per  day  doesn't 
think  again  well  with  management.  once  you  consider  the 
common  wage  per  hour  you  get  a  much  better  (and  decisive) 
image.  There  is  additionally  a  control  on  company  morale. 
workers  don't  appreciate  colleagues  outlay  hours  on  social 
networking sites (and others) whereas they're functioning to hide 
the  work.  The  impact  is  additional  pronounced  if  no  action  is 
taken against the abusers.
