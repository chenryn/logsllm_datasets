7.4 Discussions
We provided a (cid:12)rst systematic comparative study of the
major existing BLH algorithms across a comprehensive range
of k, the scope of data used in a privacy attack. While the
ranking of the algorithms by our study agrees with prior
results in the literature that either do not consider the cor-
relation or only consider it minimally (e.g., k = 2 for MI),
our new results on the hitherto unstudied range of k are im-
portant, given the clear presence of long temporal correla-
tions in real world data (e.g., traces of household electricity
consumption) and the undisputed ability of adversaries to
actually exploit this correlation. Particularly, our analysis

8. CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented a systematic study of the im-
pact of temporal correlation in time-series data on the quan-
ti(cid:12)cation of the data’s privacy protection. We evaluated
four sets of information-theoretic privacy measures, includ-
ing three that are adopted from existing measures in the
literature and a new measure of oﬄine conditional entropy
(OCE) that we proposed. By an automaton- and a Markov-
driven data model, we demonstrated that OCE satis(cid:12)es both
of our proposed axiomatic properties of desirable privacy
measures, whereas the other measures do not.
We then used OCE to evaluate the performance of three
foremost existing BLH algorithms for privacy protection of
smart meter data traces, and demonstrated the advantages
of this evaluation compared with mutual information. We
used a balance of real world U.K. traces and long synthetic
traces generated from realistic (and validated) power usage
models to ensure the relevance and convergence of our re-
sults. Our results provided a (cid:12)rst con(cid:12)rmation of the rank-
ing of these algorithms when long data correlations (i.e., a
large value of the k parameter used in the privacy measures)
are considered, beyond the regime studied in earlier work.
We also presented a novel covert channel attack on BLH pro-
tection, in which a slight malicious modi(cid:12)cation of the LS1
algorithm at strategic moments can leak signi(cid:12)cant private
information about a household’s usage of appliances. This
attack is interesting in its own right in that it only requires
an eminently feasible compromise of the BLH system’s con-
trol software { similar attacks have been repeatedly observed
for consumer grade devices { but otherwise it leverages a
normally functioning smart meter infrastructure to report
the private information. Importantly, the true power of the
malicious control becomes clear only when it is evaluated at
a large enough value of k.
