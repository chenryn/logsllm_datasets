Playwright has a utility `toMatchScreenshot` that will test a screenshot of
something against a predefined image that is in it's snapshot directory. I
would like for it to test against an image that is at an arbitrary absolute
path. If I pass in an arbitrary path, it will coerce the path (replace the
separators with hyphens) to a path inside the snapshot directory.
Is there a way I can use playwright's snapshot matching abilities to match
against an arbitrary image?
