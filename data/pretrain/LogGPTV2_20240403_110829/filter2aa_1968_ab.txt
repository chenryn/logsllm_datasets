4 Breach of contract damages generally are limited to the value of the actual loss
caused by the breach.  See 24 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 65:1 (4th ed. 2007).
Copyright damages, by contrast, include the copyright owner’s actual damages and any
additional profits of the infringer, or statutory damages as high as $150,000 per infringed
work.  17 U.S.C. § 504; see Frank Music Corp. v. MGM, Inc., 772 F.2d 505, 512 n.5 (9th
Cir. 1985).  Courts may also impose injunctive relief, seize infringing articles, and award
costs and attorneys’ fees.  17 U.S.C. §§ 502, 503, 505.

A.
Do Users of Glider Infringe Blizzard’s Copyright?
MDY does not dispute that Blizzard owns a valid copyright in the WoW game client
and game server software.  Nor does MDY dispute that the game client software, which
typically is located on the hard drive of a player’s personal computer, is copied from the hard
drive to the computer’s random access memory (“RAM”) when WoW is played.  
Ninth Circuit law holds that the copying of software to RAM constitutes “copying”
for purposes of section 106 of the Copyright Act.  MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.,
991 F.2d 511, 518-19 (9th Cir. 1993).  Thus, if a person is not authorized by the copyright
holder (through a license) or by law (through section117, which will be discussed below) to
copy the software to RAM, the person is guilty of copyright infringement because the person
has exercised a right (copying) that belongs exclusively to the copyright holder.
MDY contends that users of Glider do not infringe Blizzard’s copyright because they
are licensed to copy the game client software to RAM.  MDY claims that WoW players
acquire this license when they purchase the game client software and load it on the hard
drives of their personal computers.  MDY claims that contrary provisions of the EULA and
TOU, such as express prohibitions on the use of bots, are mere terms of contract, not
limitations on the scope of the license granted by Blizzard.  Thus, although Blizzard may
assert a claim against Glider users for breach of contract, MDY argues, it cannot assert the
more powerful claim of copyright infringement.4 
“Generally, a copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive license to use his
copyrighted material waives his right to sue the licensee for copyright infringement and can
sue only for breach of contract.”  Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 188 F.3d 1115,
1121 (9th Cir. 1999) (“Sun I”) (citations omitted).   “If, however, a license is limited in scope

and the licensee acts outside the scope, the licensor can bring an action for copyright
infringement.”  Id.  To prevail on a copyright infringement claim, therefore, a plaintiff who
has granted a license must establish that the license terms are “limitations on the scope of the
license rather than independent contractual covenants,” and that the defendant’s actions
exceed the scope of the license.   Id. at 1122.
1.
Is the EULA Limited in Scope?
The use of WoW is governed by two agreements – the EULA and the TOU.  Players
must affirmatively consent to these agreements before playing WoW.  The first paragraph
of the EULA states:  “IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO INSTALL, COPY, OR USE THE
GAME.”  Dkt. #42 at 2 (capitalization in original).  The next paragraph provides that “[a]ny
and all uses of the [game client software] are governed by the terms” of the EULA, that the
game client software is “distributed solely for use by authorized end users according to the
terms” of the EULA, and that “[a]ny use, reproduction, modification or distribution of the
[game client software] not expressly authorized by the terms of the [EULA] is expressly
prohibited.”  Id. 
Section 1 of the EULA specifically addresses the license granted by Blizzard.  With
emphasis on particular provisions, the section reads as follows:
Grant of Limited Use License.  If you agree to this License Agreement,
computer software (hereafter referred to as the “Game Client”) will be
installed on your hardware.  If your hardware meets the minimum
requirements, the installation of the Game Client will enable you to play the
Game by accessing your account with the Service (your “Account”).
Subject to your agreement to and continuing compliance with this License
Agreement, Blizzard hereby grants, and you hereby accept, a limited, non-
exclusive license to (a) install the Game Client on one or more computers
owned by you or under your legitimate control, and (b) use the Game Client
in conjunction with the Service for your non-commercial entertainment
purposes only.  All use of the Game Client is subject to this License
Agreement and to the [TOU], both of which you must accept before you can
use your Account to play the Game.
Id. at 3 (emphasis added).  
Several parts of this section are worth noting.  The title – “Grant of Limited Use
License” – makes clear that the license is limited, as does the later reference to a “limited,

5 Blizzard also argues, although with less force, that Glider users violate sections
4(B)(ii) and 4(B)(iv) of the EULA.  Section 4(B)(ii) prohibits exploiting the game client
software for any commercial purpose, and section 4(B)(iv) prohibits unauthorized
connections to the game.  Dkt. #42 at 4.  Section 4(A) provides that failure to comply with
the terms of section 4 results in the immediate and automatic termination of the EULA.  Id.
The Court will not grant summary judgment based on section 4 of the EULA because the
language of the section is ambiguous and Blizzard has presented no legal authority in support
of license provisions that “self-destruct” when users commit certain violations.

non-exclusive license.”  The grant of the limited license is expressly made “[s]ubject to your
agreement to and continuing compliance with this License Agreement.”  The section further
provides that “[a]ll use of the Game Client is subject to” the EULA and the TOU.  Thus, the
very portion of the contract that grants a license to use the game client software also makes
clear that the license is limited.
2.
Are Key Provisions of the EULA and TOU Limitations on the
Scope of the License or Separate Contractual Covenants?
Having determined that the Blizzard license is limited, the Court must construe the
EULA and TOU to determine whether the provisions violated by the use of Glider are
themselves “limitations on the scope of the license, which would mean that [the users] had
infringed the copyright by acting outside the scope of the license; or whether the terms [are]
merely separate contractual covenants, which would make this a contract dispute[.]”  Sun I,
188 F.3d at 1119.  Blizzard argues that Glider users violate portions of section 4 of the TOU
(subsections 4(B)(ii) and 4(B)(iii)) and portions of section 5 (subsections 5(B)(6) and
5(B)(8)).  Dkt. #39 at 6-7.  The Court will address these sections.5
As an initial matter, the Court concludes that limitations on the license granted by
Blizzard may be found in both the EULA and the TOU.  Section 1 of the EULA, which
grants the limited license, expressly states that users are subject to both the EULA and the
TOU.  Dkt. #42 at 3.  These contracts must therefore be read together.  As already noted,
both agreements must be accepted before a user can play WoW.  
The EULA and TOU contain no provision that explicitly lays out the scope of the
Blizzard limited license.  The Court concludes, however, that the limitations on scope are

6 Section 4 is titled “Limitations on Your Use of the Service.”  Id.  The title thus
reflects an intent to create limitations on use.  Although the title refers to “the Service,” a
term that is defined to mean the online portion of the WoW game (Dkt. #41 at 2), the Service
cannot be accessed or used without the game client software and the EULA expressly makes
the license of the game client software subject to the terms of the TOU.  Dkt. #42 at 2.  The
Court thus views the title of section 4 as consistent with the interpretation of that section as
a limitation on the license granted by Blizzard.

found in section 4 of the TOU.  The provisions of section 4 generally are designed to
preserve and protect Blizzard’s proprietary interests in its software and game, including its
copyright interests.  Dkt. #41 at 4.  Subsection A of section 4 prohibits users from
intercepting, emulating, or redirecting the proprietary components of the game, activities that
would include the exclusive copying and distribution rights possessed by Blizzard under
section 106 of the Copyright Act.  Subsection B prohibits users from modifying files that are
part of the game, an activity akin to the creation of derivative works – another right possessed
exclusively by Blizzard as copyright holder.  Subsection C prohibits users from disrupting
the game or others players’ use of the game.  Subsection D reserves Blizzard’s exclusive
right under section 106 of the Act to create derivative works.  Id.
The provisions of section 4 thus make clear that although users are licensed to play
WoW and to use the game client software while playing, they are not licensed to exercise
other rights belonging exclusively to Blizzard as the copyright holder – copying, distributing,
or modifying the work.  The provisions are limits on the scope of the license granted by
Blizzard.6
Section 5 of the TOU is different.  It is titled “Rules of Conduct.”  Id. at 4.  The
subsections of section 5 are titled “Rules Related to Usernames and Guild Designations”
(§ 5(A)), “Rules Related to ‘Chat’ and Interaction With Other Users” (§ 5(B)), and “Rules
Related to Game Play” (§ 5(C)).  Section 5 thus sets rules for the game, whereas section 4
establishes limits more clearly designed to preserve Blizzard’s copyright interests.  The
section 5 rules also regulate relatively minor matters such as the use of celebrity names
(§ 5(A)(4)) or offensive language (§ 5(A)(2)) for WoW characters.  Section 5 establishes
game rules by contract.

When the EULA and TOU are considered in their entirety, the Court concludes that
section 4 of the TOU establishes limitations on the scope of the license and section 5 sets
rules of the game as independent contract terms.  A single contract clearly can contain both
types of provisions.  See Netbula, LLC v Storage Tech. Corp., No. C06-07391 MJJ, 2008 WL
228036, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 18, 2008) (concluding that one clause of an agreement was a
contractual covenant while another clause was a limitation on the scope of the license).
3.
Do Users of Glider Act Outside the Scope of The License?
Users of Glider clearly violate the prohibition in section 4(B)(ii) of the TOU against
the use of “bots” or any “third-party software designed to modify the [WoW] experience[.]”
Dkt. #41-8 at 4.  Players who use Glider to mine WoW for game assets also violate section
4(B)(iii).  When WoW users employ Glider, therefore, they act outside the scope of the
license delineated in section 4 of the TOU.  Copying the game client software to RAM while
engaged in this unauthorized activity constitutes copyright infringement.  See MAI, 991 F.2d
at 518-19 (copying software to RAM constitutes “copying” for purposes of section 106 of
the Copyright Act); Ticketmaster LLC v. RMG Techs., Inc., 507 F. Supp. 2d 1096, 1108
(C.D. Cal. 2007) (use of bot violated TOU and gave rise to copyright infringement). 
MDY relies on the Federal Circuit’s decision in Storage Technology Corp. v. Custom
Hardware Engineering & Consulting, Inc., 421 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2005), to argue that
“uses” which violate a license constitute copyright infringement only when the uses
themselves infringe one of the exclusive rights granted by the Copyright Act.  Dkt. #57 at
6-7.  The Court is not convinced that Storage Technology should be read so narrowly.  It is
obvious that a person cannot be liable for copyright infringement without committing an act
of infringement.  Thus, where a license is at issue, the person must not only act outside the
scope of the license, but must also engage in an act that infringes upon the exclusive rights
granted the copyright holder by section 106 of the Act.  This much is clear from both Ninth
Circuit law and Storage Technology.  But to the extent MDY suggests that the act that causes
the person to fall outside the scope of the license and the act that constitutes copyright
infringement must be one and the same, MDY has cited no Ninth Circuit authority.  Nor does
