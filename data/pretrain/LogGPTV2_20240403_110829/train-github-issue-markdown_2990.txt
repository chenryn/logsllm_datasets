#### Code Sample
url =
"""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_winners_of_the_Boston_Marathon"""  
tables = pd.read_html(url, header=0)  
print(tables[0].head())
#### Problem description
The above code ''should' just extract the displayed text in the HTML table;
what's in the dataframe should be what's displayed on screen. This isn't what
happens. If the HTML contains a hyperlink with a title attribute, this is
picked up and added to the dataframe, duplicating the data.
#### Expected Output

    0  1897          John J. McDermott   
    1  1898         Ronald J. MacDonald

    3  1900         John "Jack" Caffery   
    4  1901         John "Jack" Caffery

    3                            Canada  2:39:44          NaN  
    4                            Canada  2:29:23  2nd victory 
#### Output
