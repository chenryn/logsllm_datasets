I have a textfield that has keyboard type multiline and maxLines: null. The
text will wrap on any device (including my real one) while I run the code in
debug mode, but only continues on the same line when I run it on release mode.  
`new TextField( decoration: new InputDecoration.collapsed( hintText: 'Blah
blah blah...'), maxLines: null, keyboardType: TextInputType.multiline,
controller: _storyDescriptionController, ),`
