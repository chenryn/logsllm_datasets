Hi,
We are having issues with duplication in the result set in one of our
instances running 2.1.3.
The topology is (task:Task)-[:HAS_STATE]->(state:TaskState) where the task has
a unique ID, and the cardinality of the HAS_STATE is 1:1 (one state connected
to the task via HAS_STATE):

However, when queried for the state, it returns two exact duplicate rows. You
can see that the id() of the relationship is the same:

Doing a distinct brings it to the correct result of one row.

However the weirdest part is that once the instance is restarted, the problem
goes away:

I'm thinking this might be an issue with the cache, but there is no sure way
in which we can reproduce it. Any input that might help for reproducing the
issue or have you ever experienced this issue before?
Thanks
