Table 18: Top 10 domains associated with malicious IPs in EC2 by
VirusTotal.
of the average available IPs in EC2. In contrast, no malicious IPs
were found in Azure. Table 17 breaks down the malicious EC2
IPs by region and month, showing an overall increase of malicious
activity over time.
We extract 2,888 unique domains from the 13,752 malicious
URLs. Of these, 222 (7.7%) contain the substring “download” in
their domain names. Table 18 shows the top 10 domains by number
of URLs that include the domain. The results show that Dropbox
(which runs on EC2) and other ﬁle hosting providers have become
a popular platform for distributing malware. The VirusTotal re-
ports show that 371 IPs belonging to Dropbox have been used to
distribute malicious content (the domains of these IPs all resolved
to “dl.dropboxusercontent.com” or “dl.dropbox.com”.) These 371
IPs hosted 1,929 malicious URLs and 2,421 pieces of malware.
Tr.im provides a URL-shortening service [39] that attackers some-
times use to hide malicious URLs. We observe some engines only
detecting the shortened URL, so the malicious page remains ac-
cessible via the malicious long URL. The remaining URLs in the
top 10 correspond to sites distributing adware and other potentially
unwanted software.
Figure 16: CDF of lifetimes of IPs hosting malicious content as in-
dicated by Google Safe Browsing in (left) EC2 and (right) Azure.
HTML. We ﬁnd the lifetime of malicious IPs to be relatively long;
see Figure 16. In EC2, 62% of malicious IPs host malicious URLs
for more than 7 days, and 46% host malicious URLs for over 14
days. The lifetime of malicious IPs in EC2-VPC is slightly shorter
than in EC2-Classic. The longest availability of a malicious IP was
45 days in VPC and 93 days (the complete measurements period)
for classic. In Azure, about 70% of malicious IPs host malicious
URLs for more than 7 days, and 50% for at least 14 days.
We also ﬁnd some IPs appear to serve as a “linchpin” for ma-
liciousness. A linchpin IP hosts a webpage that aggregates many
malicious URLs [37]. For example, we found at one point a partic-
ular IP address on EC2 contained 128 malware URLs (associated
with different domains); all of these URLs linked to webpages that
contained the Blackhole Exploit kit [38]. In our dataset, we iden-
tify ﬁve linchpin IPs that all host the same webpage. The malicious
URLs in these webpages point to 23 different domains. The aver-
age lifetime of the IPs that host these malicious URLs is 20 days.
VirusTotal. VirusTotal aggregates information from multiple en-
gines that detect malicious activity (e.g., AV products and black-
lists). One service VirusTotal provides is to query an IP address
to obtain a JSON report of malicious activity associated with the
IP. Each report contains passive DNS information for the IP, and
for each engine that detected malicious activity on that IP, the time
and type of the malicious activity, e.g, malicious URLs and MD5
hashes of malware hosted on the IP. During Feb. 2014, we used this
service to collect reports on all the IPs in EC2 and Azure.
VirusTotal aggregates information from the multiple engines
without validating their detections, thus it is possible that an en-
gine may (incorrectly) consider an IP address as malicious, when
other engines do not. To reduce false positives, we only consider
an IP address malicious when it is reported as malicious by two or
more engines. Even with this constraint there could still be some
false positives, which will be inherited by the following analysis.
After applying the above constraint, we ﬁnd that from Sep. 30,
2013 to Dec. 31, 2013, there were 2,070 malicious IPs in EC2,
hosting 13,752 malicious URLs. The malicious IPs represent 0.3%

Ecosys-tem on Clouds
As a ﬁnal case study to exercise WhoWas, we study the software
ecosystem of web services running the cloud. This includes the a
census covering the kinds of web servers, back-end software lan-
guages, website templates, and third party-trackers running on top
of EC2 and Azure.
In the rest of this section all the percentages reported are averages
taken over all rounds of measurement; we omit repeatedly referring
to them as averages for brevity.
Web servers and backend techniques. For EC2, we identiﬁed
the server software running on 89.9% (682 K on average) of the
available IPs. Apache (55.2%), nginx (21.2%), and Microsoft-IIS
(12.2%) are the most popular web servers, accounting for over
88.6% of the identiﬁed servers. MochiWeb is also used (30,372
servers on average, 4.4%), but the servers running it are only asso-
ciated with 47 clusters in total. Its use is almost entirely accounted
for by a single PaaS provider. We further identify the backend tech-
niques that support about 32% (215 K on average) of servers. Of
these servers, 52.6% are using PHP, followed by ASP.NET (29.0%)
and Phusion Passenger (8.1%). For the server usage and backend
techniques, we did not see any signiﬁcant difference between VPC
and classic.
In Azure, we ﬁnd, perhaps unsurprisingly, that the software
ecosystem displays less diversity. Microsoft-IIS runs on 89%
(about 86 K on average) of the identiﬁed servers in Azure. Only
about 7.6 K IPs are running Apache and 1.7 K are running nginx,
accounting for a total of 9.7% of identiﬁed servers. For back-ends
in Azure, we found that 94.2% are using ASP.net, followed by PHP
(4.3%) and Express (0.6%).
Examining the versions of commonly used servers, we ﬁnd
new versions of servers are not being adopted quickly. Of the
Apache servers in EC2, 24.6% are using Apache/2.2.22, followed
by Apache-Coyote/1.1 (15.0%) and Apache/2.2.25 (7.6%). More
than 40% of identiﬁed Apache servers are using Apache/2.2.*. A
few IPs (208 in total) in EC2 use Apache 1.3.*. The most recent
version of Apache used in EC2 is Apache 2.4.7, and this is used by
147 IPs in the last round of measurement (the highest measured).
Surprisingly, some of the websites that employ a large number of
IPs are still using Apache/2.2.22.
In Azure, the top three IIS releases being used are 8.0 (39.0%),
7.5 (23.7%), and 7.0 (19.8%). Only 3.4% are using IIS 8.5.
The Security Engineering Research Term (SERT) reported the
ten most vulnerable server versions as determined by a large-scale
scan [40]. We ﬁnd seven of the ten vulnerable servers are also being
used in both clouds. For example, in EC2 in total across all rounds
of measurement 2,641 IPs are running Microsoft-IIS/6.0, and 56
IPs are running ‘‘Apache/2.2.24 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.24 OpenSSL/
1.0.0-fips mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 mod_bwlimited/1.4 FrontPa
ge/5.0.2.2635’’. Most servers also use old releases of PHP. Of the
servers that are using PHP in EC2, 60% are using PHP 5.3.*. PHP
5.3.10 (24.5%), 5.3.27 (16.22%) and 5.3.3 (9.7%) are the 3 top used
PHP releases. The most recent version of PHP used in EC2 is PHP
5.4.23, used by 845 servers in the last round of measurement.
Website templates. We identify the template of webpages on
an average of about 26 K IPs (3% of available IPs) running on
EC2. The top 3 templates being used are: WordPress (71.1%),
Joomla! (9.7%) and Drupal (4.1%). In Azure, we only ﬁnd tem-
plates for an average of about 950 webpages. WordPress (55%) and
Joomla! (12%) are still the most popular templates in this smaller
set.
Figure 19: CDFs of the number of days an IP address hosts the
same webpage (left) before ﬁrst being labeled as malicious by
VirusTotal and (right) after last being detected as malicious by
VirusTotal.
WhoWas. We use WhoWas to analyze the content hosted over time
by the malicious EC2 IPs obtained from VirusTotal. Only 98 of the
malicious EC2 IP addresses appear in one of the ﬁnal clusters in our
analysis. The others return default webpages or errors. These 98
IPs are associated to 166 different clusters: 63 IPs are associated to
only one cluster, 21 to two clusters, and ﬁve to three clusters. Two
of the IPs are associated to 19 clusters. Among these 98 IPs, we ob-
serve three types of malicious behaviors over time. The ﬁrst type
corresponds to 34 IPs that host the same malicious webpage with-
out any changes over time. The second type are 42 IPs where the
same malicious webpage repeatedly appears and disappears. Once
detected, the malicious webpage is temporarily removed from the
IP, but returns several days later. The third type corresponds to 22
IPs that host multiple malicious webpages.
Next, we examine the lag time of the blacklists, deﬁned to be
the time a blacklist takes to detect a malicious website after it goes
up. The engines in VirusTotal may scan an IP multiple times, gen-
erating multiple records, which may be associated with different
malicious webpages. For our purposes, there are two import time
points for any given webpage: (1) the ﬁrst detection time, which
is the ﬁrst time an engine labels a webpage on an IP as malicious,
and (2) the last detection time, which is the last time the malicious
webpage on that IP was reported as being malicious by an engine.
The last detection time also indicates when the engines believe the
webpage has become benign.
Using WhoWas, we compare the lifetime of a cluster associated
with a malicious IP address to those two time points. Figure 19
shows CDFs of the time between a webpage becoming available
and being marked as malicious by the blacklist (left graph), and
the time after being removed from blacklists that a malicious web-
page remains active (right graph). Overall, about 90% of type 1
and type 3 webpages, and 50% of type 2 are detected within three
days. Most of the type 1 and type 3 webpages are removed after
the last detection. But in type 2, only about 40% of webpages are
actually removed. There are some webpages that have a very long
lifetime. For example, a particular type 1 IP hosted malware for
at least 82 days (at the time of writing it is still available, in fact).
Anecdotally, we also found that it frequently changes its domain
name, presumably to avoid detection.
We can also use the clustering mechanism of WhoWas to ﬁnd
new malicious IP addresses, by labeling as malicious IP addresses
in a cluster with a VirusTotal-labeled malicious IP address.
In
this way, we label an additional 191 IPs. As a breakdown, 15
VirusTotal-labeled IPs each had one additional IP; 10 IPs had 2
additional IPs, 6 had 3, and 16 had 4–13. We manually inspected
the WhoWas records for these additional IPs, verifying the correct-
ness of the approach in every case. All this shows that WhoWas
can help ﬁnd malicious activity.
