### Analysis of Malicious Activity in EC2 and Azure

The average number of available IPs in EC2 was analyzed, and no malicious IPs were found in Azure. Table 17 breaks down the malicious EC2 IPs by region and month, showing an overall increase in malicious activity over time.

We extracted 2,888 unique domains from the 13,752 malicious URLs. Of these, 222 (7.7%) contain the substring "download" in their domain names. Table 18 shows the top 10 domains by the number of URLs that include the domain. The results indicate that Dropbox (which runs on EC2) and other file hosting providers have become popular platforms for distributing malware. According to VirusTotal reports, 371 IPs belonging to Dropbox have been used to distribute malicious content. These 371 IPs hosted 1,929 malicious URLs and 2,421 pieces of malware.

Tr.im provides a URL-shortening service that attackers sometimes use to hide malicious URLs. We observed that some engines only detect the shortened URL, allowing the malicious long URL to remain accessible. The remaining URLs in the top 10 correspond to sites distributing adware and other potentially unwanted software.

### Lifetime of Malicious IPs

The lifetime of malicious IPs is relatively long, as shown in Figure 16. In EC2, 62% of malicious IPs host malicious URLs for more than 7 days, and 46% host malicious URLs for over 14 days. The lifetime of malicious IPs in EC2-VPC is slightly shorter than in EC2-Classic. The longest availability of a malicious IP was 45 days in VPC and 93 days (the complete measurement period) for classic. In Azure, about 70% of malicious IPs host malicious URLs for more than 7 days, and 50% for at least 14 days.

Some IPs appear to serve as a "linchpin" for maliciousness, hosting webpages that aggregate many malicious URLs. For example, one IP address on EC2 contained 128 malware URLs (associated with different domains), all linking to webpages containing the Blackhole Exploit kit. In our dataset, we identified five linchpin IPs that all host the same webpage. The malicious URLs in these webpages point to 23 different domains. The average lifetime of the IPs that host these malicious URLs is 20 days.

### VirusTotal Analysis

VirusTotal aggregates information from multiple engines that detect malicious activity, such as AV products and blacklists. During February 2014, we used this service to collect reports on all the IPs in EC2 and Azure. To reduce false positives, we only consider an IP address malicious when it is reported as malicious by two or more engines. After applying this constraint, we found that from September 30, 2013, to December 31, 2013, there were 2,070 malicious IPs in EC2, hosting 13,752 malicious URLs. The malicious IPs represent 0.3% of the total IPs.

### Characterizing the Web Software Ecosystem on Clouds

As a final case study, we used WhoWas to study the software ecosystem of web services running on EC2 and Azure. This includes a census covering the kinds of web servers, backend software languages, website templates, and third-party trackers.

#### Web Servers and Backend Techniques

For EC2, we identified the server software running on 89.9% (682 K on average) of the available IPs. Apache (55.2%), nginx (21.2%), and Microsoft-IIS (12.2%) are the most popular web servers, accounting for over 88.6% of the identified servers. MochiWeb is also used (30,372 servers on average, 4.4%), but its use is almost entirely accounted for by a single PaaS provider. We further identified the backend techniques supporting about 32% (215 K on average) of servers. Of these, 52.6% use PHP, followed by ASP.NET (29.0%) and Phusion Passenger (8.1%). No significant differences were observed between VPC and classic.

In Azure, the software ecosystem displays less diversity. Microsoft-IIS runs on 89% (about 86 K on average) of the identified servers. Only about 7.6 K IPs are running Apache and 1.7 K are running nginx, accounting for a total of 9.7% of identified servers. For back-ends in Azure, 94.2% use ASP.net, followed by PHP (4.3%) and Express (0.6%).

#### Server Versions

New versions of servers are not being adopted quickly. In EC2, 24.6% of Apache servers use Apache/2.2.22, followed by Apache-Coyote/1.1 (15.0%) and Apache/2.2.25 (7.6%). More than 40% of identified Apache servers use Apache/2.2.*. A few IPs (208 in total) in EC2 use Apache 1.3.*. The most recent version of Apache used in EC2 is Apache 2.4.7, used by 147 IPs in the last round of measurement.

In Azure, the top three IIS releases being used are 8.0 (39.0%), 7.5 (23.7%), and 7.0 (19.8%). Only 3.4% are using IIS 8.5. The Security Engineering Research Team (SERT) reported the ten most vulnerable server versions. We found seven of the ten vulnerable servers are also being used in both clouds. For example, in EC2, 2,641 IPs are running Microsoft-IIS/6.0, and 56 IPs are running 'Apache/2.2.24 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.24 OpenSSL/1.0.0-fips mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 mod_bwlimited/1.4 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635'. Most servers also use old releases of PHP. Of the servers using PHP in EC2, 60% use PHP 5.3.*. PHP 5.3.10 (24.5%), 5.3.27 (16.22%), and 5.3.3 (9.7%) are the top three used PHP releases. The most recent version of PHP used in EC2 is PHP 5.4.23, used by 845 servers in the last round of measurement.

#### Website Templates

We identified the template of webpages on an average of about 26 K IPs (3% of available IPs) running on EC2. The top three templates being used are WordPress (71.1%), Joomla! (9.7%), and Drupal (4.1%). In Azure, we only find templates for an average of about 950 webpages. WordPress (55%) and Joomla! (12%) are still the most popular templates in this smaller set.

### Malicious Behavior Over Time

Using WhoWas, we analyzed the content hosted over time by the malicious EC2 IPs obtained from VirusTotal. Only 98 of the malicious EC2 IP addresses appear in one of the final clusters in our analysis. These 98 IPs are associated with 166 different clusters. Among these, we observed three types of malicious behaviors over time:
1. **Type 1**: 34 IPs that host the same malicious webpage without any changes over time.
2. **Type 2**: 42 IPs where the same malicious webpage repeatedly appears and disappears. Once detected, the malicious webpage is temporarily removed from the IP but returns several days later.
3. **Type 3**: 22 IPs that host multiple malicious webpages.

### Lag Time of Blacklists

We examined the lag time of the blacklists, defined as the time a blacklist takes to detect a malicious website after it goes up. Using WhoWas, we compared the lifetime of a cluster associated with a malicious IP address to the first detection time and the last detection time. Figure 19 shows CDFs of the time between a webpage becoming available and being marked as malicious by the blacklist, and the time after being removed from blacklists that a malicious webpage remains active. Overall, about 90% of type 1 and type 3 webpages, and 50% of type 2 are detected within three days. Most type 1 and type 3 webpages are removed after the last detection, but in type 2, only about 40% of webpages are actually removed.

### Finding New Malicious IP Addresses

We can use the clustering mechanism of WhoWas to find new malicious IP addresses by labeling IPs in a cluster with a VirusTotal-labeled malicious IP address. In this way, we labeled an additional 191 IPs. As a breakdown, 15 VirusTotal-labeled IPs each had one additional IP; 10 IPs had 2 additional IPs, 6 had 3, and 16 had 4â€“13. We manually inspected the WhoWas records for these additional IPs, verifying the correctness of the approach in every case. This shows that WhoWas can help find malicious activity.

### Known Vulnerabilities in WordPress

WordPress versions below 3.6 contain a series of known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
