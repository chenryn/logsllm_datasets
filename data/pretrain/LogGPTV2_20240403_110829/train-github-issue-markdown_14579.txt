I created a `languageDef.js` file for ObjectPascal that used to work from the
first preview version until v0.9.2.  
As far as I know this format is no longer supported so I moved to the `.plist`
definition format. I was able to rewrite the grammar definition in order to
let the highlighted source look like 95% the same as before.
But I have a problem to redefine the bracket matching.  
This screenshot shows the bracket matching for `begin` and `end` in version
0.9.2:

I used this code in 0.9.2 to enable the bracket matching:
        brackets: [            
            // ...
            { token: 'keyword.tag-begin', open: 'begin', close: 'end' },
           // ...     
        ],
How do I enable the bracket matching in version 0.10.0 for this kind of
brackets?  
I tried to do it in the `languageMain.js` file inside the language
configuration sections `brackets`, `__electricCharacterSupport` and
`__characterPairSupport`. But none of the works when the brackets contain
multiple characters.  
Is this feature completely broken in 0.10.0?
