I previously created a `languageDef.js` file for ObjectPascal that worked from the first preview version up to v0.9.2. However, as I understand, this format is no longer supported, so I have transitioned to the `.plist` definition format. I was able to rewrite the grammar definition to maintain a 95% similarity in the highlighted source code. 

However, I am encountering an issue with redefining the bracket matching. The following screenshot illustrates the bracket matching for `begin` and `end` in version 0.9.2:

In version 0.9.2, I enabled the bracket matching using the following code:
```javascript
brackets: [            
    // ...
    { token: 'keyword.tag-begin', open: 'begin', close: 'end' },
    // ...     
],
```

How can I enable the bracket matching in version 0.10.0 for these types of brackets? I attempted to implement it in the `languageMain.js` file within the language configuration sections `brackets`, `__electricCharacterSupport`, and `__characterPairSupport`. Unfortunately, none of these methods work when the brackets contain multiple characters.

Is this feature completely broken in version 0.10.0?
