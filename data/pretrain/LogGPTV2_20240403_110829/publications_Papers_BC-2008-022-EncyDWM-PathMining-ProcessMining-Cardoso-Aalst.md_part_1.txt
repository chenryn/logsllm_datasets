#### Introduction
Business process management systems (Smith and Fingar, 2003) provide a fundamental infrastructure to define and manage business processes and workflows. These systems, often called process-aware information systems (Dumas et al., 2005), coordinate the automation of interconnected tasks. Well-known examples include Tibco, WebSphere MQ Workflow, FileNet, and COSA. Other systems such as ERP, CRM, SCM, and B2B are also driven by explicit process models and are configured based on workflow models specifying the order in which tasks need to be executed.

When process models or workflows are executed, the underlying management system generates log data describing the activities being carried out. This log can be used to discover and extract knowledge about the execution and structure of processes. The goal of process mining is to extract information about processes from these logs.

Recent developments in process-aware information systems (Dumas et al., 2005) reveal three trends:
1. **Embedding Workflow Technology in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA):** Workflow technology is increasingly being integrated into SOA.
2. **Increased Flexibility:** Systems are becoming more flexible and adaptable to accommodate human interactions.
3. **Omnipresence of Event Logs:** Current systems, ranging from cross-organizational systems to embedded devices, provide detailed event logs.

These trends are important enablers for path mining and process mining. The abundance of recorded events in structured formats facilitates the analysis of run-time behavior. Additionally, the desire for flexibility and adaptability drives the need for monitoring. If processes are not enforced by a system, it is crucial to understand what is actually happening, such as how frequently people deviate from the default procedures.

#### Background
Path mining can be seen as a tool within Business Process Intelligence (BPI). This approach uses generic mining tools to extract implicit rules that govern the path of tasks followed during the execution of a process. Generally, the realization of a process involves executing a subset of tasks. Path mining is essential for predicting the Quality of Service (QoS) in processes, particularly in e-commerce, where suppliers and customers define contracts specifying QoS items such as products or services, deadlines, quality, and cost.

A process, typically represented as a graph, includes multiple linearly independent control paths (executed in parallel). The QoS can vary significantly depending on the path followed during execution. Predicting the path with a certain degree of confidence can enhance the precision of QoS estimation algorithms.

#### Settings
This section presents a typical business process model and a process log, which will be used to explain the concepts of path mining and process mining.

**Business Process Scenario:**
A major bank has adopted a workflow management system to support its business processes. One of the services provided is the loan process, depicted in Figure 1. The process consists of 14 tasks, starting with the "Fill Loan Request" task, where clients fill in an electronic form with personal information and loan details. The next task, "Check Loan Type," determines the type of loan and forwards the request to one of three tasks: "Check Home Loan," "Check Educational Loan," or "Check Car Loan."

**Process Log:**
Many systems have event logs, often referred to as "history," "audit trail," or "transaction log." These logs contain information about events related to tasks and cases. A case, or process instance, is the entity being handled, such as a customer order, job application, insurance claim, or building permit. Table 1 illustrates a typical process log.

**Extended Process Log:**
To perform path mining, process logs need to be extended to store information about the values and types of input parameters passed to tasks and the output parameters received from tasks. Table 2 shows an extended process log that includes these details.

**Process Profile:**
To begin path mining, a profile must be created for each process. A profile provides the input for machine learning and is characterized by a fixed, predefined set of attributes corresponding to the task input/output parameters stored in the process log. Each profile is associated with a path attribute indicating the path followed during the process execution.

**Profile Classification:**
The attributes in a profile trigger the execution of specific tasks. For each profile, we associate a path attribute, which is a target class. Classification algorithms classify instances into target classes. Once profiles and path attributes are determined, data mining methods can establish a relationship between the profiles and the paths followed at runtime.

**Experiments:**
We present the results of applying an algorithm to a synthetic loan dataset. We generated a synthetic dataset using the loan process model and logged a set of process instance executions. The data includes process names, instance IDs, task names, variable names, and the path followed during execution. Table 3 shows the additional data stored in the process log.

Each entry corresponds to an instance execution. We conducted 34 experiments, analyzing 34,000 records containing data from 1,000 process executions. We used the J.48 algorithm, Weka’s implementation of the C4.5 decision tree learner, to classify profiles. The results are shown in Figure 2.
