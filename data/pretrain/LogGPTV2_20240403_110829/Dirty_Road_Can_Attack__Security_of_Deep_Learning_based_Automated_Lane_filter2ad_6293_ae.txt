### Vehicle Attack Simulation and Real-World Evaluation

#### Simulation Results
| Scenario | Goal | Average Deviation (m) | Maximum Speed (mph) | Standard Deviation (std) | Success Rate | Time (s) |
|----------|------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Highway  | Hit barrier on the left | 0.76 | 65 (29 m/s) | 5e-3 | 100% (100/100) | 0.97 |
| Local    | Hit truck in the opposite lane | 0.55 | 45 (20 m/s) | 7e-2 | 100% (100/100) | 1.36 |

#### Safety Impact on Real Vehicles
While the simulation-based evaluation demonstrates significant safety risks, it does not account for other driver assistance features commonly used with ALC, such as Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB). This raises questions about whether the safety issues identified in ยง6 persist when these additional features are active, especially those designed to enhance safety like AEB.

To address this, we conducted real-world experiments using a Toyota 2019 Camry equipped with OpenPilot, which provides ALC, LDW, and ACC, while the Camry's stock features include AEB and FCW [8]. The tests were performed on a rarely-used dead-end road, ensuring minimal disruption to other vehicles. The setup is shown in Figure 14.

##### Evaluation Methodology
We validated the attack realizability under various lighting conditions in our previous miniature-scale experiment (ยง5.4). In this experiment, we directly injected an attack trace at the lane detection (LD) model output level, as detailed in Appendix C. This approach avoids the need to place physical patches on the road, which could interfere with other vehicles.

##### Experiment Setup
- **Cardboard Boxes**: Placed adjacent to but outside the current lane to mimic barriers and obstacles.
- **Driving Speed**: ~28 mph (~45 km/h), the minimum speed for engaging OpenPilot.
- **Trials**: 10 trials with and without the attack.

##### Results
- **With Attack**: 100% collision rate (10 out of 10 trials), including 5 front and 5 side collisions.
- **Without Attack**: No collisions in any of the 10 trials.

These results indicate that driver assistance features like LDW, ACC, FCW, and AEB do not effectively prevent the safety risks posed by our attack on ALC. Specifically:
- **LDW**: Not triggered because it relies on the same lane detection module affected by the attack.
- **ACC**: No action taken as no front vehicle was detected.
- **FCW**: Triggered 5 times, but only 0.46 seconds before the collision, insufficient for human reaction.
- **AEB**: Not triggered in any of the 10 attack trials, resulting in a 100% false negative rate.

### Limitations and Defense Discussion

#### Limitations
1. **Attack Deployability**: High success rate (93.8%) with 8 quick-deployable road patches. Further stealth can be achieved by mimicking road workers and choosing low-traffic times.
2. **Generality Evaluation**: Evaluated on one production ALC (OpenPilot). Vulnerability of other systems like Tesla Autopilot and GM Cruise remains unclear.
3. **End-to-End Real-World Evaluation**: Limited by safety and access constraints. Future work aims to lower the minimum engagement speed and gain access to private testing facilities.

#### Defense Discussion

##### Machine Learning Model Level Defenses
- **Evaluation**: Tested 5 popular defense methods (JPEG compression, bit-depth reduction, Gaussian noise, median blurring, autoencoder reformation).
- **Results**: All methods reduced attack success rates but also decreased benign-case success rates. None effectively defended against the attack without harming normal driving performance.

##### Sensor/Data Fusion Based Defenses
- **LiDAR**: Costly and not generally used in production ALC systems.
- **HD Maps**: Potential solution, but requires accurate and up-to-date lane information. Current ALC systems do not use HD maps due to scalability and cost concerns.

### Related Work
- **Autonomous Driving (AD) System Security**: Research on sensor security and autonomy software security. Our work focuses on production ALC, addressing design challenges not covered by prior studies.
- **Physical-World Adversarial Attacks**: Multiple works have explored image-space adversarial attacks, but few have systematically addressed the operational domain of ALC.
