APPENDIX
A. SECURITY PROOF FOR NAOR COM-
MITMENT VARIANT
In Section 2.3 we deﬁned a multi-bit variant of Naor’s
commitment in the CRS model. For n-bit strings, we need
a crs ∈ {0, 1}4n. Let G : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}4n be a pseudo-
random generator, and let pad : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}4n be the
function that prepends 3n zeroes to the front of its argu-
ment. Then the commitment scheme is:
• Comcrs(x; r): set C = G(r) + crs · pad(x), with arith-
• Chkcrs(C, σ = (r, x)): return x if C = G(r) + crs ·
metic in GF (24n); set σ = (r, x).
pad(x); otherwise return ⊥.
Theorem 2. This commitment scheme satisﬁes the prop-
erties of binding and hiding given in Section 2.3.
Proof. Hiding follows easily from the security of PRG G.
In particular, for all crs and x, a commitment is generated
as C = G(r) + crs · pad(x). Since r is chosen uniformly, the
result is pseudorandom.
Binding follows from the following argument. An adver-
sary succeeds in equivocating if and only if it can produce
C, r, x, r(cid:48), x(cid:48) with x (cid:54)= x(cid:48) and:
C = G(r) + crs · pad(x) = G(r
(cid:48)
) + crs · pad(x
(cid:48)
)
⇐⇒ crs = [G(r) − G(r
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
)](pad(x
) − pad(x))
−1
Since x (cid:54)= x(cid:48) and pad is injective, pad(x(cid:48)) − pad(x) (cid:54)= 0
indeed has a multiplicative inverse in the ﬁeld.
Let us call a crs “bad” if there exists r, r(cid:48), x (cid:54)= x(cid:48) sat-
isfying the above property. Clearly an adversary’s success
probability in equivocation is bounded by Pr[crs is bad].
There are at most 22n values of G(r) − G(r(cid:48)) and at most
2n values of pad(x(cid:48))−pad(x) (under the standard encoding of
GF (2k) into {0, 1}k, we have pad(x(cid:48))−pad(x) = pad(x(cid:48)⊕x)).
Hence there are at most 23n bad values of crs. It follows that
the probability of a random crs ∈ {0, 1}4n being bad is at
most 1/2n.
