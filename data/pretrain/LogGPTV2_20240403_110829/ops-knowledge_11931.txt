I am attempting to set up `easy_install` on my Mac, but I encounter the following error:

```
Installing Setuptools
running install
Checking .pth file support in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/
error: can't create or remove files in install directory
The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the installation directory:
[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/test-easy-install-789.pth'
The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or the distutils default setting) was:
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/
```

It appears that I do not have the necessary permissions to write to the `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/` directory.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, try running the command with elevated privileges using `sudo`. For example:

```sh
sudo python easy_install <package_name>
```

This will allow the installation process to write to the specified directory.
