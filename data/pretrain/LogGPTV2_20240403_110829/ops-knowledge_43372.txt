In the left panel, select the "Turn Windows features on or off" option. In the pop-up "Windows Features" dialog box, expand the "Internet Information Services" node, and select the "Web Management Tools" and "World Wide Web Services" options. In the "World Wide Web Services" option, expand the "Application Development Features" node, select the "ASP.NET 4.7" and ".NET Extensibility 4.7" options. Then click the "OK" button to let the Windows server install IIS. Step 2: Configure IIS On the Windows server, open "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager" and select "Application Pools" in the left panel. Create a new application pool and set the .NET version to "4.0". In the "Sites" panel, click the "Add Website" button and enter the website name in the pop-up dialog box. Enter the storage location of your web application in the "Physical Path" field. In the IP Address field, select All Unassigned, and enter 80 in the Port Number field.

Step 3: Test the website Enter the IP address or host name of the IIS server in the browser, and add the website name. If your web application is properly configured and running on the server, you should be able to see the front page of your web application. Notes: - Firewall settings: IIS server listens to port 80 by default, so when you run IIS, make sure your firewall allows traffic on port 80 to pass through. - Application pool settings: In order to avoid the failure of the application pool to cause the entire site to crash, it is recommended to create an application pool for each page separately. - Security Settings: Make sure your web application has proper security configurations, such as SSL certificates and protection against cross-site scripting attacks. - Website Backup: Regularly back up your entire website to prevent accidental data loss.
