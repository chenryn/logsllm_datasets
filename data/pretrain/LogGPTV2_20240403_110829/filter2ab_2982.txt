### Title: Black Hat Asia 2023: Patching Loopholes: Discovering Backdoors in Applications

In the digital age, applications are integral to our daily lives, enabling everything from routine tasks to the storage of sensitive data. However, the security of these applications is a critical concern. As the cybersecurity lead for the Singapore Government, GovTech is committed to securing government applications through proactive security assessments.

Given the diverse and expansive application landscape, we employ a range of techniques, including fuzzing, source code reviews, and reverse engineering, to identify new vulnerabilities. In this presentation, we will delve into the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used to uncover backdoors that developers may have inadvertently or maliciously introduced into two specific applications: a Windows-based thick client and an iOS application. These backdoors, often unknown to users, pose significant security risks, and understanding how to detect and mitigate them is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of our digital infrastructure.
