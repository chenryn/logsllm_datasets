From the DEF CON 19 CFP:
Okay, let’s get sneaky...
Covert
• without the subject’s knowledge
Post-Exploitation
• after a remote compromise, local backdoor
Forensics
• reconstructing data above and 
beyond what the subject 
anticipates
Forensics and 
penetration testing/
other offensive 
operations
For the forensics geeks...
?
No subject location, no problem
Surreptitious acquisition and analysis
Familiar tools...
For the penetration testing 
geeks...
Potential for more important data gathered 
per compromised system
“We don’t keep that data”
Multiple revisions of ﬁles, old data
Data carving
General purpose scripting
Stealthy!
Typical Forensics 
Examination Scenarios
• Hardware seizure
• Authorized software agents
• On-site
• “Suspect”/Subject is aware
Covert Remote 
Forensics
• Unaware Subject
• No known physical location?
• Not a deal-killer.
• Remote imaging
• Remote block device access
Ears perking up yet?
• Intelligence
• Penetration testers upping post-
exploitation game
• Compliance
• Criminal

File System Forensic 
Capabilities
• Allocated ﬁles
• Deleted ﬁles
• Slack space
• Disk/Volume
• Unallocated space
• Deletion vs. Formatting vs. Wiping
• Imaging
Slack Space Example
Sector size: 512 bytes
Cluster size: 4 sectors
File size: 4150 bytes
RAM Slack (probably 0’d)
Disk Slack (potential goodies)
Can’t I do this already?
• Load sleuth kit up onto the compromised 
target?
• Probably will work but...
• ...stomping on deleted ﬁles
• ...not that stealthy
• ...a little less slick than what I’m 
proposing:
Enter Railgun
• “Patrick HVE” - Are you out there? Massive 
thanks!
If we can call Windows 
API remotely...
• ...then we can access physical/logical block 
devices directly
• ...which means we can read arbitrary 
sectors from the disk
• ...why not map remote block devices to 
local ones?
Metasploit Post 
Modules
• enum_drives.rb
• Helper/Support
• imager.rb
• byte-for-byte imaging
• Hashing
• Split images
• Cool, but..........
nbd_server.rb!
• Run forensic tools locally, on local block 
devices that are mapped to remote block 
devices!
• API calls made over meterpreter shell
• NBD (Network Block Device)
• Easy way to get programmatic block 
devices in Linux
• Read-only (forensic write-blocking)
• Direct remote access with off-the-shelf/ 
commercial/open-source tools

Caveats and exercises 
for the reader
• Network
• Speed
• Stealth
• Cleaner/cross-platform implementation
• Pure ruby iSCSI?
Conclusions
• Go and wring more data out of systems!
• Builds capability for forensic examiners and 
penetration testers
• Encourage secure wiping
