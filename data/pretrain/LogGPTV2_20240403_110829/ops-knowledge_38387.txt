User: In a bash shell, I can use 'bash ' or 'source ' to invoke a script by hand. Can I do the similar thing in the Python IDLE's interactive shell? I know I can go to File >> Open Module, then run it in a separate window, but that's troublesome.
Assistant: If what you meant is executing in the Python IDLE's interactive shell instead of command prompt or command line, then I usually use this approach:
python  -m idlelib.idle -r "C:/dir1/dir2/Your script.py"
It works well with me. Tested on my Windows 10, python 3.7.3.
Please ensure that you have added your desired python version on your environment variables.
