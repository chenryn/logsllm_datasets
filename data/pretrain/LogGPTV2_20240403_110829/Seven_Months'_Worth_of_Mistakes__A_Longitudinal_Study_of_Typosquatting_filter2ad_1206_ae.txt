posquatters by showing ads on the mistyped domains. As such,
these networks can be held equally responsible for the damage
against the authoritative domains that are being attacked. Next
to the use of ads as a monetization strategy, there have also
been documented cases of typosquatting domains used to serve
malware [9]. Nikiforakis et al. [20] showed that typosquatting
can also occur outside the conﬁnes of a browser’s address bar,
in remote JavaScript inclusions. There, developers mistype the
domains of remote code providers and thus make their sites
susceptible to malicious script injections served through the
appropriate mistyped domains.
Szurdi et al. [23] recently investigated typosquatting regis-
trations targeting .com domains that are in the “long tail” of
the popularity distribution. The authors present a tool named
Yet Another Typosquatting Tool (YATT), which uses passive
domain features and (optionally) active domain features such
as DNS, WHOIS and content information, to identify and
categorize typosquatting domains into categories similar to
ours. The authors use this tool to classify 4.7 million potential
typosquatting .com domains derived from the Alexa top 1 mil-
lion. Their results indicate that, although the typosquatting
saturation decreases for less popular authoritative domains, it
is still at 40% near the Alexa 1 million rank and an estimated
20% of all .com domains appear to be typosquatting domains.
The study also includes a longitudinal component, tracking the
domain registrations between October 2012 and October 2013
based on daily dumps of the .com zone ﬁle. In contrast to our
study, the content of these domains is not taken into account for
the longitudinal analysis. That is, when a new domain appears
in the zone ﬁle, it is compared against the list of all potential
typosquatting domains generated from the Alexa 1 million, to
determine whether or not it is an active typosquatting domain.
The authors ﬁnd, amongst other results, that typosquatting
domains of popular authoritative domains appear to change
hands much more frequently than other domains.
Finally, Vissers et al. [24] very recently performed a study
which explored the ecosystem of domain parking services.
While these services have previously been investigated in the
context of cybersquatting, this study explores the domain park-
ing ecosystem in its own right. The authors discover, among
other results, that between 1.63% and 9% of the investigated
parking domains are typosquatting domains. The study also
shows that some of the investigated parking service providers
have a signiﬁcantly higher ratio of typosquatting domains
than others, with only one provider serving no typosquatting
domains at all.

Homograph attacks: In domain-homograph attacks, attack-
ers take advantage of the perceived visual similarity between
two or more letters, in order to trick the user into believing that
she is interacting with a speciﬁc authoritative website while
she is interacting with a malicious one. This confusion can be
abused to convince users to willingly submit their credentials
and other sensitive information. The main difference between
these attacks and the previously mentioned domain squatting
attacks, is that the homograph domains are usually spread-out
through spam emails and social networks, instead of relying
on user mistakes, since their construction cannot usually be
achieved through typical typing mistakes.
Gabrilovich and Gontmakher showed that characters from
non-Latin character-sets that look like Latin characters can
be substituted to confuse the user of
the nature of a
given domain [10]. For instance, an attacker could register
paypal.com using the Cyrillic letter P (lower case “r”,
Unicode U+0440), which looks almost identical to the Latin
letter “p”. Today, this type of attack is signiﬁcantly harder since
browser vendors revert to the punycode format of URLs [4],
whenever they think that a domain is maliciously crafted.
Dhamija et al. [6], investigate why phishing works, and
mention “visually deceptive text”, i.e., domains that substitute
characters with look-alikes within the same character-set, such
as bankofvvest.com (two “v”s instead of a “w”). Hol-
gers et al. [13] performed a large-scale study of homograph
attacks by gathering popular domains and searching for their
homographed versions. Their results showed that, even though
the monetization strategies of homograph domains are very
similar to traditional domain squatting, the practice of regis-
tering homograph domains is signiﬁcantly less popular than
typosquatting.
Other types of domain squatting:
In 2011, Dinaburg
proposed a new type of domain squatting, bitsquatting [7].
Dinaburg hypothesized that random bit-ﬂips that occur in
hardware memory that is failing or operating outside normal
temperatures, can be abused for domain squatting purposes,
assuming that the ﬂips would occur in the bits holding the
textual representation of a domain name. Domain squatters can
register domains that have a one-bit difference from popular
authoritative domains and capture the trafﬁc resulting from
such erroneous bit-ﬂips. Dinaburg registered 30 bitsquatting
domains, such as mic2osoft.com, and recorded more than
50,000 requests over an eight-month period. Later research
showed that domain squatters have already adopted this tech-
nique [18]. Recently, Nikiforakis et al. also discovered that
domain squatters, next to typos, are also abusing the sound
similarity of words to construct malicious squatting domains
and attract users to them [19].
V. CONCLUSION
Typosquatting has been known and studied for over 15
years, yet we have shown that it remains a popular form of
domain abuse up until this day. By performing the ﬁrst content-
based longitudinal study of typosquatting abuse, we have
investigated to what extent previously discovered typosquatting
trends still hold today, and have also discovered many new
typosquatting facts. Our main results include that (1) few
trademark owners protect themselves against typosquatting by
defensively registering typosquatting domains for their own do-
mains, (2) over 75% of all possible typosquatting domains for
short popular authoritative domains are already registered, and
that typosquatters are increasingly targeting longer domains,
(3) typosquatters are varying their monetization strategy over
time, (4) some companies choose not to renew their defensive
registrations of typosquatting domains, leading these domains
back into the eager hands of typosquatters, (5) up to 50%
of all typosquatting domains can be traced back to just four
typosquatting page hosters and (6) certain top-level domains
are much less prone to typosquatting than others, due to their
price setting and local registration and arbitration policies. We
hope this paper and the corresponding dataset, which has been
made publicly available online, can serve as a new reference
for the state of the typosquatting landscape.
