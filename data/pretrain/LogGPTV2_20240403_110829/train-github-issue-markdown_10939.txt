What use are options like `precision`, `rounding_mode` for an integer type?
Why is this form called "integer" when it clearly deals with floats?
I'd expect integer type to allow only values like `-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`
etc, and to have options like `allow_negative` and `allow_zero`.

I'd expect `number` field to behave like this (based on configuration
options), and `integer` type should only allow.. well.. integer values. The
name of this form is misleading.
PS. Am I the only one who finds `precision` weird option for an "integer"
type?
