User: Under the framework of the established technical architecture, you need to plan a new virtual machine cluster deployment. Please explain how to choose the appropriate hardware configuration and software patches, and design the cluster load balancing solution.
Assistant: 1. Hardware configuration selection: 1) CPU and memory: Select CPU and memory specifications according to the number of virtual machines and application load. Generally speaking, more virtual machines and more complex workloads require more CPU and memory hardware with high configuration. 2) Storage: Store the disk image and data of the virtual machine on a highly reliable storage device, such as RAID, to ensure performance and data reliability. 3) Network: Deploy high-availability network devices, such as dual network cards, load balancers, etc., to reduce the risk of single point failure. 2. Software patch selection: Timely upgrade the virtualization software version and security patches to mitigate security vulnerabilities and improve performance. 3. Cluster load balancing scheme design: 1) Load balancer: By setting up a load balancer, client requests can be distributed to multiple virtual machine instances to achieve load balancing. 2) Failover: When a physical machine fails, the virtual machine instance can be migrated to a healthy physical machine through the Failover mechanism to ensure high availability of the virtual machine. 3) Dynamic load balancing: monitor the performance indicators of each virtual machine at the same time, such as CPU, memory, network, etc., make decisions based on the performance status of each virtual machine and schedule resources from the central machine, so as to achieve dynamic load balancing and improve the processing of virtual machines capacity and stability.
