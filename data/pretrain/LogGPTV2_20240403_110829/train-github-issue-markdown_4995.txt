# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18363.900
    PowerToys version: 0.19.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
Whenever I try to use FancyZones, the overlay looks kinda weird. The numbers
are duplicated and in different spots, which results in FancyZones looking
like this.
These are my FancyZones settings:  & . I do not have any custom layouts and
encountered the issue when using the default grid style. Other styles also
seem to give the issue, but the grid style is then "on top" of the chosen
style, as seen here.
By the way, it seems to only be a visual issue, as it will always apply the
correct zone, e.g. when using rows and grid style is on top, the window snaps
to the row format, not to the grid format.
