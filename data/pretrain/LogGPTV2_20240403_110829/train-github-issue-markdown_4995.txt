### Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** 10.0.18363.900
- **PowerToys Version:** 0.19.1
- **PowerToy Module:** FancyZones

### Issue Description
When using the FancyZones feature, I encounter a visual anomaly with the overlay. The numbers on the zones appear duplicated and are displayed in different positions, causing the overlay to look like this:

### Settings
- **FancyZones Settings:**
  - No custom layouts are in use.
  - The issue is observed with the default grid style.
- **Other Styles:**
  - The problem also occurs with other layout styles, but the grid style seems to overlap the chosen style, as shown in the following example:

### Additional Notes
- This appears to be a purely visual issue, as the correct zone is always applied. For instance, when using rows and the grid style is overlaid, the window snaps to the row format, not the grid format.

Please let me know if you need any further information or additional details to help resolve this issue.
