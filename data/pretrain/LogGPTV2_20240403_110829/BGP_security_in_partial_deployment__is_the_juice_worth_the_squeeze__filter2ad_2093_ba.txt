ular and the IXP-augmented graphs respectively. As an up-
per bound, we consider only the former number. Recall from
Section 4.1 that our security metric is an average of happy
sources, where the average is taken over all sources and all
appropriate destination-attacker pairs. It follows that that
for any one destination, there can be at most 11, 953 doomed
single-homed ASes when summed over all attackers and all
sources. Therefore, the fraction of doomed sources does not
exceed .001% and .01% when considering all and only non-
stub attackers respectively. While Observation E.4 suggests
there could be other doomed nodes (other than the just the
single-homed stub ASes), however, the Internet graph is suf-
ﬁciently well-connected to ensure that the number of such
ASes is small.
Immune ASes. A similar characterization is possible for
immune ASes.
Observation E.4. In the security 1st model, for a par-
ticular destination-attacker pair (d, m), a source AS vi is
immune if every one of its perceivable routes PR(vi,∅, m)
contains d.
As we discussed above, immune ASes tend to be single-
homed stub ASes.
F. PROTOCOL DOWNGRADE ATTACKS.
In Section 3.2 we discussed how protocol downgrades can
occur in the security 2nd and 3rd model. We now prove
Theorem 3.1, that shows that protocol downgrade attacks
are avoided in the security 1st model; that is, every AS s
that uses a secure route that does not contain the attacker
m under normal conditions, will continue to use that secure
route when m launches its attack.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. The theorem follows from the
correctness of the algorithm in Appendix B.4 for comput-
ing routes when security is 1st. Suppose the set of secure
routes is S. Consider an AS s who has its secure route Rs
ﬁxed during the FSCR, FSPeerR, FSPrR subroutine of the
algorithm in Appendix B.4 when the set of secure ASes is S
and the attacker is m = ∅ (i.e., during normal conditions,
when there is no attack). If Rs does not contain m, then
s will have its route ﬁxed to exactly the same secure route
Rs during the FSCR, FSPeeR, FSPrvR subroutine of the
algorithm in Appendix B.4 when the set of secure ASes is S
and m attacks. This follows because all routes that contain
m must be ﬁxed after the FSCR, FSPeeR, FSPrvR portions
of the algorithm (since, by deﬁnition, all routes containing
m must be insecure during m’s attack). An inductive argu-
ment shows that all ASes on route Rs will therefore be ﬁxed
to the same route that they used in normal conditions, and
the theorem follows.
F.1 Computing protocol downgrades.
To quantify the success of protocol downgrade attacks
with respect to an attacker-destination pair (m, d) and a set
of secure ASes S, we need to ﬁrst establish which ASes have
a secure route to the destination under normal conditions,
that is, when there is no attack. To do this, we compute the
S*BGP routing outcome when there is no attacker (setting
m = ∅ for the set S) for the speciﬁc model under consid-
eration. The algorithm records for every AS discovered in
this BFS computation whether (1) all routes in its BPR set
at that iteration is secure or (2) all these routes are inse-
cure. We then compute the S*BGP routing outcome for
the pair (m, d) for the set S (for the speciﬁc model under
consideration)). Again, the algorithm records for every AS
discovered in this BFS computation whether (1) all routes
in its BPR set at that iteration are secure or (2) all these
routes are insecure. We conclude that a protocol-downgrade
attack against an AS is successful if that AS falls in the 1st
category in the ﬁrst of these computations and in the 2nd
category in the second computation. The correctness of this
approach follows from the correctness of our algorithms in
Appendix B.
G. MONOTONICITY
In Section 6.1 and Appendix A we showed that collateral
damage is possible in the security 2nd and 1st models. We
now prove Theorem 6.1 that shows that collateral damage
does not occur in the security 3rd model; that is, for any des-
tination d, attacker m, source s and S*BGP deployments T
and S ⊆ T , if s stabilizes to a legitimate route in deployment
S, then s stabilizes to a legitimate route in deployment T .
Proof of Theorem 6.1. The theorem follows from the
correctness of our algorithm for computing routing outcomes
when security is 3rd (Appendix B.2). First, an inductive ar-
gument shows that every AS s that the algorithm “ﬁxes” to a
secure route in deployment S is also “ﬁxed” to a secure route
in T ; it follows that all such ASes stabilize to a legitimate
route in both S and T . Next we argue that every AS s that
