### Changes in Comcast Inter-Domain Traffic Patterns

**Figure 3: Changes in Comcast Inter-Domain Traffic Patterns (July 2007 - July 2009)**

- **Graph (a): Origin and Transit Growth**
  - This graph illustrates the weighted average percentage of inter-domain traffic originating, terminating, and transiting through Comcast ASNs.
  
- **Graph (b): Ratio Change**
  - This graph shows the change in Comcast's In/Out peering ratio over the two-year period.

### Top Ten Origin ASNs (July 2009)

| Rank | Provider       | Percentage |
|------|----------------|------------|
| 1    | Google         | 5.03%      |
| 2    | ISP A          | 1.78%      |
| 3    | LimeLight      | 1.52%      |
| 4    | Akamai         | 1.16%      |
| 5    | Microsoft      | 0.94%      |
| 6    | Carpathia Hosting | 0.82%   |
| 7    | ISP G          | 0.77%      |
| 8    | LeaseWeb       | 0.74%      |
| 9    | ISP C          | 0.73%      |
| 10   | ISP B          | 0.70%      |

**Table 3: Top Ten Origin ASNs by Weighted Average Percentage of All Inter-Domain Traffic in July 2009**

**Figure 4: Cumulative Distribution of Inter-Domain Traffic Contributed by Origin ASNs (July 2007 - July 2009)**

- **Key Observations:**
  - Google accounts for an average of 5% of all inter-domain traffic.
  - ISP Aâ€™s enterprise/CDN business contributes 1.7%, and LimeLight contributes 1.52%.
  - CDNs, as a category, are estimated to contribute approximately 10% of all Internet inter-domain traffic.
  - Our estimates may understate CDN contributions due to the difficulty in distinguishing CDN traffic from other data sources.
  - Akamai CDN traffic is excluded from this analysis because it is primarily served from caches within provider infrastructure.
  - Large content providers are increasingly interconnected with each other and other providers.

### Direct Peering Relationships (July 2009)

- **Google:** 65% of study participants use a direct adjacency.
- **Microsoft:** 52% maintain a direct peering relationship.
- **LimeLight:** 49% have a direct peering relationship.
- **Yahoo:** 49% have a direct peering relationship.

### Application Traffic Analysis (July 2007 - July 2009)

#### Methodology

- **Port/Protocol Classification:**
  - Commercial appliances classify applications by protocol and TCP/UDP port.
  - Limitations: Port-based heuristics can only identify control traffic for protocols like FTP and do not account for tunneled applications or P2P traffic using non-standard ports.
  - More than 25% of observed inter-domain traffic remains unclassified.

- **Payload Classification (DPI):**
  - Inline appliances deployed across five provider deployments in Asia, Europe, and North America.
  - These appliances use proprietary payload signatures and behavioral heuristics to classify applications.
  - The dataset provides additional validation and insight but may be biased towards consumer applications and P2P traffic.

#### Largest Applications by Traffic Volume (July 2009)

**Table 4: Top Application Categories by Weighted Average Percentage of Inter-Domain Traffic**

- **Table 4a: Port/Protocol Classification**
  - Web: 52%
  - Video: 2.64%
  - VPN: 1.41%
  - Email: 1.38%
  - Unclassified: 37%

- **Table 4b: Payload Matching**
  - Web: 52.12%
  - P2P: 18.32%
  - Email: 1.54%
  - Other: 20.54%
  - Unclassified: 5.51%

**Figure 5: Cumulative Distribution of Inter-Domain Traffic by Well-Known Ports and Protocols (July 2007 - July 2009)**

- **Key Observations:**
  - HTTP video may account for 25-40% of all HTTP traffic.
  - Encrypted P2P/other ports represent 10-15% of uncategorized traffic.
  - Other video/audio streaming protocols make up 3-5% of uncategorized traffic.
  - The remaining traffic is distributed across hundreds of less common applications.

#### Application Traffic Changes

- **TCP and UDP:**
  - Combined, they account for more than 95% of all inter-domain traffic.
  - VPN protocols (IPSEC AH and ESP) contribute another 3%.
  - Tunneled IPv6 (protocol 41) adds a fraction of one percent.
  - The remaining traffic is distributed across a wide range of protocols, likely representing configuration errors and denial-of-service attacks.

- **Cumulative Distribution:**
  - In July 2007, 52 ports contributed 60% of the traffic.
