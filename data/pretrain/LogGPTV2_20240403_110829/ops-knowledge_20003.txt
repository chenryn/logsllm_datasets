Assistant: This log chunk shows the NameSystem and DataNode components of a distributed file system performing various operations. The NameSystem is adding stored blocks to the blockMap, while the DataNode is receiving blocks from other nodes, sending blocks to other nodes, and terminating packet responders. Additionally, the DataNode is verifying blocks and the NameSystem is allocating blocks.
