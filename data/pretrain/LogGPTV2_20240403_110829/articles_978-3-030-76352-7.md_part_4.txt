in these context-aware methods. Furthermore, most of the studies have not supported
multivariate analysis. Advantages of multivariate analysis include an ability to glean
a more realistic picture than looking at a single variable. On the other hand, hybrid
processing takes advantage of historical data, which will increase the accuracy of the
method.

grid-basedclustering,andmodelconstructionusingmultipleregression.
DataPreprocessing: Firstly, each historical data value (historical data of data value
thatshouldbeevaluatedintermsofquality)andcontextualinformation(historicaldata

consideredasanaccuratedatavalue.
Grid-BasedClustering: Allhistoricaldatavaluesoncontextualinformationmustthen
be clustered in terms of a common feature (e.g. location in geo-location data). For
this purpose, this historical information is clustered with a grid-based clustering. The
greatadvantageofgrid-basedclusteringisitssignificantreductionofthecomputational

ModelConstructionusingMultipleRegression: As soon as the clustering is com-

3.2 AssessingQualityofStreamingData(Online)
Aftercreatingadistributionmodelforeachcluster,byobservingnewdatastreams,the
online quality assessment process begins, which has several steps including assigning
datastreamstothedesiredcluster,recordingcontextualinformationinthecorresponding
log,obtainingthedistributionfunctionandthepredictedvalue,detectingandcleaning

andontheotherhand,ifthenumberofclustersissmall,theaccuracyofthedistribution

a trade-off by providing a grid-based clustering algorithm. In each of the first depth
clusters,thereismetadataforfastersearchandallocationofdatatothedesiredcluster.
Therefore,usingthesemetadata,thedatastreamsandtheircontextualinformationare

Abstract. Internet of Things is being used in every field of life. The
increased IoT devices are building heterogeneous networks which result
in introducing some serious challenges. The presence of mobile nodes
makes the network unstable, the protocols used in these network do
not offer the required security level and network growth results in more
energy consumption. On the other hand, the Container-Based solutions
are getting huge attention because they are lightweight then Virtual
Machines (VMs). They are reusable, flexible and offer dynamic alloca-
tion of resources. In this article, we have proposed a Container-Based
architecture which offers Mobility, Energy and Security Management as
a Service (MESMaaS). Our main objective is to implement MESMaaS
at the core of the network to address Network issues and to achieve
improved network performance in terms of network life time, network
stability,re-transmissionofdata,signalingcost,packetloss,data&net-
work security and other communication issues.

ciency and security as offered by the traditional communication protocols [1,5].
Considering the network and user requirements, the provision of services such
as mobility, energy and security management are matters which still need to be
addressed. Most of the applications of the Internet of Thing today use mobility
as a way for sharing and processing of information. It also facilitates the inte-
gration of Low power wireless networks with other Internet Protocol (IP)-based
networks. But the presence of mobile nodes in the network makes the network
unstable which result in increased signaling cost and increased re-transmission
ofdata.Therefore,thesupportformobilityinanIoTenvironmentisparamount
to make network stable. Further, the energy efficiency increases the lifetime of a
network and security ensures the reliability of the network.
Recently, container based virtualization has already been introduced to IoT
devices which is mainly focusing on resource utilization such as single device
providing multiple sensing requirements. The intended research will provide a

instability due to presence of mobile node and lake of security due to constraint

we can achieve quality of service by eliminating performance anomalies in con-
straint networks. This article will invite the attention of researchers towards
container based network optimization and direction for the future research. The
research article is organized as follows:
The Sect.2 will provide the research work already conducted in this field
and benefits offered by the container-based services. In Sect.3, we will discuss a

implementation.TheSect.5willconcludetheresearchandwewilldiscussabout
the future direction.
1.1 Container-Based Virtualization
Resource utilization through virtualization is one of the most important con-
cepts in cloud computing as it involves the process of creating virtual instance
of an object instead of creating it physically. Now it is not limited to creating a
virtual machine, hardware platform, utilizing computer network resources, stor-
age server or an operating system. The virtualization provides an intermediate
softwarelayeronthetopofasystemtoprovideabstractionofasystemtoutilize

Containers are comparatively more resource efficient as they eliminate the
execution of guest operating system and more time efficient as they avoid boot-

for a specific platform. Containers enable us to run multiple platforms on same
IoT device simultaneously to run a specific application. Research studies [6,11]

2.1 Existing Container-Based Virtualization Solutions
Docker offers an open platform for implementing container-based virtualization
on Linux using Linux kernel. The Docker Container as compared to VM does
not demand independent OS. It is build on the functionality provisioned by
the kernel to achieve resource isolation i.e. computation power, memory, block
