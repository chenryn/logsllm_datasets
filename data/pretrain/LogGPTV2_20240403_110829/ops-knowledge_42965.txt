User: I would like to write a tiny calendar-like application for someone as a birthday present (to be run on Ubuntu). All it should do is display a separate picture each day, so whenever it's invoked it should check the date and select the appropriate picture from the collection I would provide, but also, in case it just keeps running, it should switch to the next picture when the next day begins.
The date-checking on invocation isn't the problem; my question pertains to the second case: how can I have the program notice the beginning of the next day? My clumsy approach would be to make it check the current date at regular intervals and let it change the displayed picture once there was a change in date, but that strikes me as very roundabout and not particularly elegant.
In case any of you have got some idea of how I could accomplish this, please don't hesitate to reply. I would aim to write the application in either Perl or Python, so suggestions concerning those two languages would be most welcome, but any other suggestions would be appreciated as well.
Thanks a lot for your time!
Assistant: Did you think about scheduling the invoke of your script?
For me, the best approach is this:
1.Have two options to run the script:

run_script
run_script --update

2.Schedule the update run in some task scheduler (for example Cron) to be executed daily.
3.When you would want to check the image for current day, simply run the script without update option.
If you would like me to extend any part of these, simply ask about it.
