To effectively implement CIS Control 7.3, "Perform Automated Operating System Patch Management," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Establish a Patch Management Policy**: Develop and document a comprehensive patch management policy that outlines the frequency, scope, and responsibilities for applying operating system patches. This policy should be aligned with the organization's overall security strategy.

2. **Automate Patch Deployment**: Implement an automated patch management system to regularly update all enterprise assets. This system should be configured to deploy patches at least monthly, or more frequently if critical vulnerabilities are identified.

3. **Prioritize Critical Patches**: Ensure that the patch management system prioritizes and applies critical security patches as soon as they become available. This helps to mitigate the risk of exploitation by known vulnerabilities.

4. **Test Patches in a Controlled Environment**: Before deploying patches to production systems, test them in a controlled environment to ensure they do not cause any unintended disruptions or conflicts with existing applications.

5. **Monitor and Report on Patch Status**: Continuously monitor the status of patch deployment across all assets and generate regular reports to track compliance and identify any gaps in the patching process.

6. **Regularly Review and Update the Patch Management Process**: Periodically review and update the patch management process to incorporate new best practices, address any issues, and adapt to changes in the organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure.

CIS Control 7.3 is categorized under the asset type "Applications" and falls under the security function "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of cyber threats.
