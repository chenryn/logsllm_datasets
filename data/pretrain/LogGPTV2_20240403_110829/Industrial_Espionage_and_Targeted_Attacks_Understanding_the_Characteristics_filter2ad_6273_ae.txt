### 4.4 Massive Organizational Targeted Attacks (MOTA): Nitro and Taidoor

Approximately one-third of attack campaigns are organized on a "large-scale" and fit the profile of a Massive Organizationally Targeted Attack (MOTA). These attacks target numerous individuals across multiple organizations, spanning various sectors, and often occur over several days. Such large-scale campaigns are typically well-resourced, employing up to four different exploits during a single campaign. Some campaigns are multilingual, tailoring the language used in the email attacks to the targeted recipients (e.g., Chinese for .cn domains, Japanese for .jp, Russian for .ru, etc.).

The TAIDOOR attacks, which were covered in a previous threat report [13], exemplify this type of mass-scale attack campaign. These attacks can involve a long series of attack waves, sometimes spread over an extended period (several months or even years). As illustrated in Figure 9, the relationships between attackers in these campaigns are often complex, with many interconnections at multiple levels (e.g., common MD5s, shared mailer or IP address). This complexity suggests that multiple teams of attackers may be collaborating or sharing resources such as malicious code, virtual servers for launching attacks, or intelligence data on targets. The campaigns usually target a large number of recipients working for different organizations, which may be active in completely different sectors.

The NITRO attacks, another example of a mass-scale attack campaign identified by TRIAGE, primarily occurred in late July 2011 and continued into mid-September. An additional, unconfirmed NITRO campaign was also identified in October 2011. The primary goal of the NITRO attacks appears to be industrial espionage, targeting the chemical and petroleum industries to collect intellectual property for competitive advantage. For instance, Symantec blocked over 500 attacks where the attackers used a spoofed email address (purportedly from an IT support desk) to entice users to install a fake Adobe software update packaged in a zip file, which contained a zero-day exploit. While most targeted recipients were employees in the chemical industry, our research shows that the NITRO attackers also targeted senior executives in the defense and aerospace sectors during the same series of attacks in October 2011.

### Case Study: The NR4 Campaign

Let's examine another case of a MOTA campaign, as shown in Figure 10. The NR4 campaign is one of 130 mass-scale attack campaigns identified by TRIAGE. The ultimate goal of the attackers behind this campaign remains unknown, but they targeted diplomatic and government organizations. Over a three-month period, 848 attacks were launched on 16 different days. All attacks originated from accounts on a popular free webmail service, using one of three different sender aliases. Multiple email subject lines, mostly related to current political issues, were used, and almost all targeted recipients were placed in the BCC field of the emails.

**Figure 10.** Visualizing the NR4 targeted attack campaign (mass-scale type)

The first wave of attacks began on April 28, 2011, from a single email alias, targeting four organizations. One organization saw its CEO, media, and sales personnel targeted. Over the course of the campaign, the CEO was targeted 34 times. On May 13, 2011, a new email account began sending emails, and it was from this account that the majority of the attacks occurred. This alias continued to target the four initial organizations and added dozens of additional organizations. One organization, first targeted in this wave, was targeted 450 times, with 23 people within the organization being targeted, primarily researchers.

The final attack wave started on June 30, 2011, and ended 19 days later. It targeted both existing and five new organizations. By July 19, 2011, the NR4 campaign concluded. During the three months, hundreds of emails, in English and Chinese (for Chinese-speaking targets), were sent to targeted users. Each email contained an attached PDF or RAR file with the same exploit, which would infect users once opened. Interestingly, the three attackers involved in the NR4 campaign used the same command-and-control (C&C) servers for controlling compromised machines and exfiltrating data.

### 5. On the Prevalence and Sophistication Level of Targeted Attacks

In this section, we aim to find evidence supporting the following assumptions about targeted attacks:
- Targeted attacks employ more sophisticated exploitation methods compared to other types of attacks, so the attachment files in our experimental dataset should not be seen in the wild long before the observed attack dates.
- Targeted attacks target only a limited number of organizations or sectors, so the attachment files or dropped binaries after successful exploitations should not be present on a large number of computers.

To achieve these goals, we enrich the existing information about the attachment files used in targeted attacks by correlating data from Symantec’s Worldwide Intelligence Network Environment (WINE).

#### 5.1 Investigating Historical Information

To achieve our goals, we utilized data from Symantec’s dynamic malware analysis platform, VirusTotal, and WINE. Symantec’s dynamic analysis platform (DAP) analyzes various file types, including *.pdf, *.doc, and *.xlsx. To better understand the intentions of the attackers, we analyzed the files downloaded after successful exploitations. We used Symantec’s DAP to acquire a list of downloaded or created files (droppees) once the attachment file (dropper) was opened and successfully compromised the victim's computer. We then searched for these droppees in WINE to gather historical information.

WINE is a platform through which Symantec shares data with the research community. It includes datasets such as malware samples, binary file reputation data, A/V telemetry data, email spam, URL reputation, and IPS telemetry. For our analysis, we focused on the A/V telemetry and binary reputation system. Since 2009, the A/V telemetry has recorded detections of known threats, while the binary reputation data includes all binary files not detected by Symantec’s security products, providing insights into what happened before signatures for malicious binaries were created.

In summary, to investigate the prevalence and sophistication of targeted attacks, we applied the following methodology for each campaign identified by TRIAGE:
1. Prepared a list of MD5 hashes of the droppers employed in the attacks.
2. Searched the droppers in Symantec’s DAP to find associated droppees.
3. Searched both droppers and droppees in the A/V telemetry data to determine the lifetime of the targeted attacks.
4. Searched the droppees in the binary reputation data.

By correlating the results from the three WINE components, we extracted the following information:
- The first and last time the file was detected as malicious.
- The first and last time the file was downloaded by customers before a detection signature was generated.
- The number of machines that downloaded or attempted to download the file.
- The associated threat name and vulnerability ID, if available.

#### 5.2 Malware Analysis Results

We conducted experiments to gain insights into the characteristics of malware used in targeted attacks.

**First Experiment:**
We queried 18,850 attachment files in Symantec’s DAP and VirusTotal. Only 941 (5.0%) of the droppers used in targeted attacks were identified. Therefore, we could not retrieve any information about 195 out of 345 campaigns from either Symantec or any other A/V product. Since a majority of the attachments were not found by any A/V scanners, we concluded that targeted attacks are not very prevalent. If they were as prevalent as other large-scale attacks, it would be harder to remain undetected. Another possible explanation is that targeted attacks use more sophisticated techniques, allowing them to evade most security measures and remain hidden for longer periods.

**Second Experiment:**
We parsed the analysis reports produced by Symantec’s DAP to acquire the list of droppees downloaded or created after droppers successfully compromised the victims. The droppers created 1,660 distinct files. We then searched all droppers and their associated droppees in WINE and extracted the relevant information. In WINE, we found records for dropper/droppee detections and downloads for only 51 attack campaigns identified by TRIAGE. The lack of records for the remaining campaigns could be due to the victims not being Symantec customers or the use of zero-day attacks that evade signature-based detection methods.

To measure the prevalence of the 51 attacks found in WINE, we computed the number of computers reporting the presence of the droppees or droppers. The average number of machines affected by one of these campaigns was only 5, further supporting the conclusion that targeted attacks are not very prevalent.

Targeted attacks are usually active for a limited period, ranging from a few days to several months. To validate this, we compared the first and last times the droppers/droppees were recorded in WINE with the start and end times of the targeted attacks. Figures 11(a) and 11(b) show that the majority of attachment files were not observed in the wild more than two weeks before the attack time specified by Symantec.cloud. Droppees, however, exhibit different behavior, with some never observed outside the attack window.
