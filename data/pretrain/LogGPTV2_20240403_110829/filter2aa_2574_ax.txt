 Data Compromised Repository Websites
These sites hold a list of websites that have suffered from a data breach in the past. 
When a site suffers from a data breach, registered user details—especially usernames 
and passwords—usually get revealed to the public. Many people have a bad practice 
of using the same password for more than one account (e.g., using the same password 
for Facebook and for an e-mail account), so knowing one password may grant access to 
other social accounts/services belonging to the same user.

The following sites are popular websites that list information from a data breach; you 
can use them to gain intelligence about any target online:
• 
Have I been Pwned (https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords): 
This site lists half a billion real-world passwords previously exposed 
in data breaches. You can also download the Pwned Passwords list, 
which contains additional data about each breached account (such 
as the number of times that password had been seen in the source 
data breaches). This site can be searched using a target e-mail 
address or the password itself to see whether it appears in plain 
text on any public password dump list (see Figure 6-3). This is a 
recommended site.
•

Hacked E-mails (https://hacked-emails.com): Check anonymously

Note! the darknet contains many public databases that list pwned accounts with 
passwords in clear text. the last known password dump file found on the darknet 
contained 1.4 billion clear-text credentials in a single file.ii
For the individual, it is illegal to access other people’s accounts using stolen 
credentials on pwned databases. For oSint investigators, the debate continues 
whether leaked information is a legal source of oSint or not!

Windows Server technology means that the target company is using Windows OS in 
its infrastructure). A person’s expertise, education, and job history can be found easily 
by looking at their résumé on job websites; an individual’s résumés can also reveal
