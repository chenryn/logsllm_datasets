We've been adding a bunch of sync file system ops (aka handlers) recently -
for example `deno.statSync`. We want to have async thread pool versions of
these ops but we would like to do it without fully duplicating all of the
existing code.
This will require a relatively invasive refactoring of how we structure
handlers.rs, so that we're mapping messages to Rust futures instead of to
functions. Then we should leverage https://tokio-rs.github.io/tokio/tokio_fs
This is more of an umbrella issue - it will likely take several smaller
refactors to get there.
