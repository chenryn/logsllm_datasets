## Abstract
Over the past decade, the number of mobile phones has surpassed the world population, particularly in developing countries like India and China. The convergence of telephony and the Internet, facilitated by technologies such as VoIP, has enabled cybercriminals to exploit the telephony channel for attacks, including scams, fraudulent services, and voice-based phishing (vishing). In this paper, we introduce and deploy the first mobile phone honeypot, MobiPot, which collects fraudulent calls and SMS messages. We implement multiple methods to advertise honeycards (honeypot SIM card numbers) and investigate how fraudsters target these numbers. Over a seven-month period, MobiPot collected over two thousand voice calls and SMS messages, with more than half being unsolicited. Our findings show that seeding honeycards helps discover new types of mobile telephony threats.

## 1. Introduction
According to reports from the University of Manchester and the International Telecommunication Union, mobile phone subscriptions have grown by over 7% annually in the last ten years. Since October 2014, there have been more mobile phones than people, with the GSMA's real-time tracker setting the number of mobile devices at 7.58 billion as of November 2015, surpassing the estimated world population of 7.24 billion. Countries like China and India have experienced significant growth in mobile technologies, with China having over 1.2 billion active mobile phones and a 93% penetration rate.

Cybercriminals, who traditionally relied on the Internet for fraud, now see telephony as an attractive target due to its wider reach and the higher trust people place in it. This makes it susceptible to social engineering attacks, such as resetting online banking credentials and stealing money. Advances in Internet telephony, such as VoIP, have provided a fast, cheap, and easy way for large-scale attacks, including telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) and robocalls.

Recently, researchers introduced a telephony honeypot called Phoneypot to investigate telephony threats, confirming the existence of various forms of abuse. However, their work did not differentiate between landline and mobile numbers or actively engage attackers for in-depth study.

In this paper, we introduce and deploy a novel mobile telephone honeypot, MobiPot, to better understand mobile telephony threats. MobiPot uses honeycards to monitor, engage, and record activities of potential attackers via calls and SMS messages. To our knowledge, MobiPot is the first system to provide automated engagement with potential attackers, enabling longer conversations and deeper insights into attacks. We also propose and implement several ways to seed honeycards, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of various seeding techniques. Finally, we analyze the call and SMS records to investigate the behavior of mobile telephony attackers, leading to multiple insights, including the use of both SMS messages and calls in coordinated scams.

### Contributions
- We propose and deploy the first reported mobile telephony honeypot system, MobiPot, using honeycards from multiple regions and providers in China.
- We seed honeycards in three distinct ways, including mobile malware, social networks, and abuse lists, and analyze the effectiveness of these seeding mechanisms.
- Over a seven-month period, we collected 1,021 SMS messages from 215 senders and 634 calls from 413 callers. Using a semi-automated approach, we verified that 82.95% of the SMS messages and 57.73% of the calls were unsolicited and represented mobile telephony abuse/threats.
- We validate our results with public complaint databases, showing that a large fraction of source numbers classified as malicious were previously unknown.
- We identify several interesting cases that help us better understand the mobile telephony threat.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related work and background, Section 3 introduces MobiPot and its deployment, Section 4 presents the data collected and our analysis, Section 5 presents case studies, and Section 6 discusses additional seeding options. We conclude the paper in Section 7.

## 2. Related Work and Background
Honeypots have been extensively used to collect threat intelligence in computer networks, including email spam, malware, and general attacks. They have also been used to investigate VoIP threats, such as SPIT (Spam over IP and Telephony) and other VoIP abuse. In contrast, research on telephony honeypots is limited.

A MAAWG best practices paper demonstrates the benefits of having a telephony honeypot. Gupta et al. introduced and deployed a telephony-based honeypot called Phoneypot, aimed at investigating telephony-specific threats like TDoS, telemarketing, and telesurveys. Phoneypot used unallocated telephone numbers to collect evidence of voice abuse but did not explore SMS abuse or actively engage callers.

MobiPot differs from Phoneypot in several ways:
- It focuses specifically on mobile telephony threats by implementing a dedicated SIM card-based honeypot.
- It extends the analysis to include SMS messages, collecting twice as many messages as calls.
- It records the content of both messages and calls, going beyond Phoneypot by seeding honeypot numbers in multiple ways and investigating the effectiveness of these approaches.

Other related work includes Jiang et al.'s analysis of voice call graphs to detect telephony frauds and Maggi and Griffin's analysis of vishing, showing that vishing is popular in the United States and often conducted by humans.

## 3. System Overview and Deployment
### 3.1 System Architecture
To interface with real mobile phone numbers and enable automatic recording of calls and SMS messages, we use a hybrid approach. We employ a GSM-VoIP gateway to virtualize the mobile telephony infrastructure and use real mobile phone numbers in the form of SIM cards (honeycards) to implement the physical layer. We use the GoIP-8, an 8-SIM card version of a GSM-VoIP gateway, to register our GSM honeycards with the VoIP soft-switch system Asterisk. This setup allows us to manage multiple honeycards and concurrently receive/transmit over each of them in a single installation.

We configure GoIP-8 with eight honeycards registered in some of the largest cities in China across two telecom providers. We use the VoIP soft-switch system to emulate a person interacting with the caller. When a call is received, we play an automated engaging message to keep the caller on the line. Caller and callee numbers, as well as the content of SMS messages and calls, are recorded and stored in an encrypted database.

### 3.1.1 MobiPot Deployment in China
We chose China for our first deployment due to its high adoption of mobile phones. According to Statista, China has over 1.2 billion active mobile telephones and a 93% penetration rate. There are more mobile phones than traditional landline installations in China.

### 3.1.2 Seeding MobiPotâ€™s Phone Numbers
Another challenge is "advertising" the phone numbers used by MobiPot to make them appealing to attackers. We classify honeycards based on how they are seeded using a PPP model (Passive, Public, and Private).

- **Passive Honeycards (nsd1 and nsd2)**: These are never seeded. Calls and SMS messages to these numbers are typically misdialed or randomly targeted.
- **Public Honeycards (soc1 and soc2)**: These are seeded by actively publishing them on websites in the public domain, assuming this will make them attractive to fraudsters but not to legitimate users. Social networking sites and online dating websites are potential targets for fraudsters to scrape and obtain phone numbers.
- **Private Honeycards (mal1 and mal2)**: These are seeded through mobile malware, which can steal contact details and potentially lead to calls or messages from fraudsters.

Table 1 shows the details of our numbers and how and when they were seeded.

| Group | Technique | Numbers | Seeded Date |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Passive | None | nsd1, nsd2 | N/A |
| Public | Social Network | soc1, soc2 | [Date] |
| Private | Malware | mal1, mal2 | [Date] |

By carefully exposing MobiPot's phone numbers, we aim to attract as many unsolicited calls as possible for recording and analyzing.
