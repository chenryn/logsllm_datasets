ABSTRACT
Over the past decade, the number of mobile phones has
increased dramatically, overtaking the world population in
October 2014. In developing countries like India and China,
mobile subscribers outnumber traditional landline users and
account for over 90% of the active population. At the same
time, convergence of telephony with the Internet with tech-
nologies like VoIP makes it possible to reach a large number
of telephone users at a low or no cost via voice calls or SMS
(short message service) messages. As a consequence, cy-
bercriminals are abusing the telephony channel to launch
attacks, e.g., scams that oﬀer fraudulent services and voice-
based phishing or vishing, that have previously relied on
the Internet.
In this paper, we introduce and deploy the
ﬁrst mobile phone honeypot called MobiPot that allow us to
collect fraudulent calls and SMS messages. We implement
multiple ways of advertising mobile numbers (honeycards)
on MobiPot to investigate how fraudsters collect phone num-
bers that are targeted by them. During a period of over
seven months, MobiPot collected over two thousand voice
calls and SMS messages, and we conﬁrmed that over half of
them were unsolicited. We found that seeding honeycards
enables us to discover attacks on the mobile phone numbers
which were not known before.

INTRODUCTION
According to reports from the University of Manchester [17]
and the International Telecommunication Union [34], mobile
phone subscriptions have grown over 7% yearly in the last
ten years. Since October 2014, there have been more mobile
phones than people [7]. As of November 2015, the GSMA’s
real-time tracker sets the number of mobile devices to 7.58
billion [16], overtaking the 7.24 billion estimated world pop-
ulation [8]. Countries like China and India have experienced
a huge growth in mobile technologies [27, 6]. For example,

China has over 1.2 billion active mobile phones with 93%
penetration rate [32].
Cybercriminals, who traditionally relied on the Internet
to commit fraud, consider telephony an attractive target
not only due to its wider reach, but the fact that people
have traditionally trusted it more, making it prone to more
eﬀective social engineering attacks a-l´a-Mitnick for stealing
private information or accessing protected systems. As we
fortify defenses on the Internet side, telephony provides an
alternative path to potential victims for the cybercriminals.
They can easily reach such victims with unsolicited calls and
spam SMS messages, which has become a serious problem
in many countries. Social engineering attacks over the tele-
phony channel to reset online banking credential and steal
money have already been reported [20]. Voice phishing at-
tacks can exploit the telephony channel to lure their victims
into revealing conﬁdential information like birthday, resi-
dence, and credit card numbers [22].
Lately, advances in Internet telephony technologies like
VoIP have provided miscreants a fast, cheap, and easy way
to conduct large-scale attacks. For example, fraudsters can
dial and reach victims via voice calls worldwide at very
low cost. Telephony denial-of-service attacks [14] or mas-
sive number of robocalls (one-ring calls) [2] have become
another form of telephony threats. Recently researchers in-
troduced a telephony honeypot (Phoneypot) aimed at inves-
tigating telephony threats, and found evidence of telephony
denial-of-service, unsolicited telemarketing, and debt collec-
tor abuse [13]. Authors used unassigned telephone numbers
– numbers that do not belong to real users – to collect evi-
dence of unwanted calls targeting people in North America.
Their work conﬁrmed the existence of a wide variety of tele-
phony abuse, but did not diﬀerentiate landline and mobile
numbers or actively invite or engage attackers for more in-
depth study. In addition to that, the aim of the work was
to study accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of data col-
lected to understand telephony abuse.
In this paper, we introduce and deploy a novel mobile tele-
phone honeypot that we name MobiPot (Mobile HoneyPot)
to gain better understanding of mobile telephony threats.
First, we conﬁgure MobiPot with honeycards (honeypot sim-
card numbers) to monitor, engage, and record activities of
potential attackers who target our honeycards via calls and
SMS messages. Unlike email spam, voice calls require active
engagement with the callers to understand their goals. To
the best of our knowledge, MobiPot is the ﬁrst system to
723provide the ability for automated engagement with poten-
tial attackers which enables it to record longer conversations
and therefore gain better insights into the attacks. Second,
we propose and implement several ways to actively advertise
or seed honeycards. This allows us to evaluate the eﬀective-
ness of various seeding techniques, including those that were
not investigated in previous studies. For example, malicious
mobile apps are known to steal contact details (phone num-
bers). By using this seeding method for honeycards, we can
ﬁnd out if such stolen phone numbers actually get calls or
messages by fraudsters. Finally, we analyze the call and
SMS records to investigate how mobile telephony attackers
behave. This led to multiple insights into attacks, including
the use of both SMS messages and calls in certain coordi-
nated scams.
In summary, our paper makes the following contributions:
• We propose and deploy the ﬁrst reported mobile tele-
phony honeypot system called MobiPot with honey-
cards that come from multiple regions and providers
in China.
• We seed honeycards in three distinct ways, including
mobile malware, social networks, and abuse lists and
analyze eﬀectiveness of these seeding mechanisms.
• Over a period of seven months, we collected 1,021
SMS messages from 215 senders and 634 calls from
413 callers. By using a semi-automated approach, we
verify that 82.95% of the SMS messages and 57.73%
of the calls are unsolicited and indeed represent mobile
telephony abuse/threats.
• We validate our results with public complaint databases
and show that a large fraction of source numbers that
we classify as malicious were previously unknown.
• We also identify a number of interesting cases that help
us better understand the mobile telephony threat.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follow. We
ﬁrst present related work and background in Section 2 with
discussions on the diﬀerence between an earlier telephony
honeypot called Phoneypot [13] and MobiPot. We then in-
troduce MobiPot and its deployment in a realistic setting in
Section 3. Section 4 presents the data that we collect with
the deployment of MobiPot and our analysis of this data.
We present some interesting case studies in Section 5 and
discuss additional seeding options in Section 6. We conclude
the paper in Section 7.
2. RELATED WORK AND BACKGROUND
Honeypots have been extensively used for collecting threat
intelligence in computer networks to ﬁght email spam [31],
malware [10], and attacks in general [30]. They have also
been used to investigate VoIP threats, including spam over
IP and Telephony (SPIT) [35] and other VoIP abuse [9].
In contrast to the use of honeypots for Internet threats,
there has been limited research on telephony honeypots.
There is a MAAWG best practices paper to demonstrate
the beneﬁts of having a telephony honeypot [12]. Close
to our work, Gupta et al. [13] introduced and deployed a
telephony-based honeypot called Phoneypot aimed at inves-
tigating telephony-speciﬁc threats like telephony denial-of-
services (TDoS), telemarketing, and telesurveys. Phoneypot
used unallocated telephone numbers to collect evidence of
voice abuse. It did not explore SMS abuse and callers were
not actively engaged. Call audio was not recorded either.
MobiPot diﬀers from Phoneypot in a number of ways and
explores several new areas. Firstly, it speciﬁcally focuses
on mobile telephony threats by implementing a dedicated
simcard-based honeypot. Secondly, in addition to calls, Mo-
biPot extends the analysis to include SMS sent to honey-
cards and resulting in a collection of twice as many mes-
sages as calls. Thirdly, in addition to the callers’ source
number, MobiPot records the content of both messages and
calls. We go beyond Phoneypot by seeding the honeypot
numbers in multiple ways and investigating eﬀectiveness of
the seeding approaches. In particular, because we focus on
mobile phones, we are able to study if phone numbers leaked
by malicious applications actually do receive calls.
Besides Phoneypot, there is other related work that tar-
gets telephony threats. Jiang et al. [18] performed analysis
on voice call graphs to detect telephony frauds from call
records. In a following work, the same authors designed and
applied a statistical model to detect spam numbers based on
their footprints on the grey telephone space [19]. Maggi [22]
and Griﬃn [11] analyzed the voice pishing (vishing) phe-
nomenon on a collection of detailed reports submitted by
the victims through a website they deployed. They showed
that vishing is very popular in the United States and often
conducted by humans, as we conﬁrmed in our work.
3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW AND DEPLOYMENT
As discussed in Section 2, there has been a recent deploy-
ment of a telephony honeypot that investigated and con-
ﬁrmed the existence of a wide variety of telephony abuse [13].
In this paper, we propose a mobile speciﬁc honeypot system
called MobiPot that diﬀers from this prior work in terms of
its design in a numbers of ways.
First, we focus on mobile phone numbers as the victim and
try to identify attacks speciﬁcally targeting mobile users.
For example, we include SMS messages into our study which
were not considered in the previous system [13]. Second, we
want to take a more active approach in engaging the sources
of abuse calls so that we could extract more information
from them. MobiPot does this by engaging the callers and
recording the call audio. The passive approach taken by
prior work did not do this and simply recorded the caller
and called numbers with a timestamp. Third, we consider
seeding the phone numbers (making our honeycards known
to attackers) part of the deployment process, whereas exist-
ing work only passively monitored unused phone numbers.
Figure 1 shows an overview of our systems design.
3.1 System Architecture
To interface with real mobile phone numbers (on a GSM
network with simcards) and at the same time enable au-
tomatic recording of calls and SMS messages, we follow a
hybrid approach in the system design. We use a GSM-VoIP
gateway to virtualize the mobile telephony infrastructure –
including its stack – and real mobile phone numbers in the
form of simcards (i.e., the honeycards) to implement the
physical layer. With the GSM-VoIP gateway, we manage
multiple honeycards and concurrently receive/transmit over
each of them in a single installation. We rely on 8-simcard
version of GoIP (GoIP-8 [21]) as the GSM-VoIP gateway
to register our GSM honeycards with the VoIP soft-switch
724telephony privacy protection which allows us to record
calls legally [23, 5]. We recognize that legitimate users
may misdial honeycards and could send an SMS mes-
sage by mistake. This is no diﬀerent than phone users
reaching strangers by mistake. We made sure that any
information received by MobiPot was securely main-
tained (in an encrypted database) and was not shared
or used for any purpose other than this study.
In view of these considerations, we chose to have our ﬁrst
deployment of MobiPot in China. We collected the data us-
ing our system in China for over seven months from August
22nd 2014 to March 27th 2015 (both dates included).
Seeding MobiPot’s Phone Numbers
3.1.2
Another challenge consists of “advertising” phone numbers
used by MobiPot to make them appealing for the attackers
for abuse. Telephony users are known to receive unwanted
calls without the need of advertising their numbers, e.g.,
from telemarketers that automatically call a multitude of
numbers, or simply spam. This could be because the phone
number space is limited and a high fraction of possible num-
bers are allocated. However, to understand how attackers
choose phone numbers that are targeted by them (especially
in a country like China that has a huge population and a
massive number of mobile phones), we design and deploy
MobiPot by carefully exposing its phone numbers. The goal
is to attract as many unsolicited calls as possible for record-
ing and analyzing; therefore, we investigate various ways of
promoting the phone numbers so that more attackers con-
sider these numbers as their targets. Using a PPP model
(P assive, P ublic and P rivate), we classify honeycards based
on how they are seeded to be attractive for the scrapers and
not for legitimate users.
We organized our eight mobile numbers in groups of two
and seeded six of them with three diﬀerent techniques – i.e.,
a pair of mobile numbers for each seeding technique. The
remaining two numbers were not seeded. Table 1 shows the
details of our numbers and how and when they were seeded.
Passive honeycards .
Passive honeycards (nsd1 and nsd2) are never seeded.
Calls and SMS messages to these numbers are typically mis-
dialed or randomly targeting phone numbers without any
pre-qualiﬁcation, or attempts to qualify a phone number as
“interesting/active”. Another reason of unwanted calls and
messages could be prior history, where these numbers might
have been issued previously to some other entity.
Seeding Public Honeycards– Social Network (soc1 and
soc2).
These honeycards are seeded by actively publishing them
at websites in a public domain with the assumption that this
will make them attractive to fraudsters but not to legitimate
users.
Social networking sites like Facebook, Google+, Twitter,
and personal web blogs/web sites could potentially be the
targets for fraudsters to scrape and obtain phone numbers.
Moreover, some of the online dating websites allow users to
provide phone numbers to be a part of their public proﬁle
which can be misused by fraudsters. This idea stems from
research which suggests that fraudsters may be using social
networking sites to entice users to call the numbers they

system running Asterisk 1. The cost of which is approx-
imately 1,000 USD. Asterisk is a well-known open source
telephony switching and private branch exchange service for
Linux. We use SIP as the communication protocol between
Asterisk and GoIP-8. Our implementation runs on a stan-
dard Linux Ubuntu-32bit installation with 4GB of RAM and
500GB of hard-drive.
3.1.1 MobiPot Deployment in China
We conﬁgure GoIP-8 with eight honeycards registered in
some of the largest cities of China across two telecom providers
(see Table 1). We use the VoIP soft-switch system to emu-
late a person interacting with the caller. A major challenge
with telephony honeypots, as much with honeypots in gen-
eral, is to keep the attacker (busy) in the system as long
as possible. For that purpose, when a call is received, we
play an automated engaging message with the goal of in-
centivizing the caller to keep the call running. We emulate
a receiver with hearing diﬃculties by playing pre-recorded
messages (in Chinese) that read Hello. [...] Hello? [...] Do
you hear me? [...] Better now? [...]. Caller and callee num-
bers as well as the content of SMS messages and calls were
recorded and stored in a database. We focus our evaluation
on China for the following reasons.
• China has the largest adoption of mobile phones. Ac-
cordingly to Statista, China tops the world with over
1.2 billion active mobile telephones and 93% penetra-
tion rate [32]. As of now, there are more mobile phones
than traditional landline installations in China.
