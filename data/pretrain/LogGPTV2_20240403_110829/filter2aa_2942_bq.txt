addressed.  
RISK RESPONSE DECISION  
TASK 3-3: Decide on the appropriate course of action for responding to risk.  
As described in [NIST SP 800-39], enterprises should select, tailor, and finalize C-SCRM 
controls based on an evaluation of alternatives and an overall understanding of threats, risks, and 
supply chain priorities. Within Level 1 and Level 2, the resulting decision and the selected and 
tailored common control baselines (i.e., revisions to established baselines) should be documented 
within a C-SCRM-specific Risk Response Framework.71 Within Level 3, the resulting decision 
and the selected and tailored controls should be documented within the C-SCRM plan as part of 
an authorization package.  
Risk response decisions may be made by a risk executive or delegated by the risk executive to 
someone else in the enterprise. While the decision can be delegated to Level 2 or Level 3, the 
significance and the reach of the impact should determine the level at which the decision is being 
made. Risk response decisions may be made in collaboration with an enterprise’s risk executives, 
mission owners, and system owners, as appropriate. Risk response decisions are heavily 
influenced by the enterprise’s predetermined appetite and tolerance for risk. Using robust risk 
appetite and tolerance definitions, decision makers can ensure consistent alignment of the 
enterprise’s risk decisions with its strategic imperatives. Robust definitions of risk appetite and 
tolerance may also enable enterprises to delegate risk decision responsibility to lower levels of 
the enterprise and provide greater autonomy across all levels.  
Within Level 1 and Level 2, the resulting decisions should be documented with any changes to 
requirements or selected common control baselines (i.e., enterprise or mission and business

process level) within C-SCRM-specific Risk Response Frameworks. The C-SCRM Risk 
Response Framework may influence other related Risk Response Frameworks.  
The Risk Response Framework should include: 
• A description of the threat source, threat event, exploited vulnerability, and threat event 
outcome; 
• An analysis of the likelihood and impact of the risk and final risk exposure; 
• A description of the selected mitigating strategies and controls along with an estimate of 
the cost and effectiveness of the mitigation against the risk.  
Within Level 3, the resulting decision and the selected and tailored controls should be 
documented in a C-SCRM plan. While the C-SCRM plan is ideally developed proactively, it 
may also be developed in response to a supply chain cybersecurity compromise. Ultimately, the 
C-SCRM plan should cover the full SDLC, document a C-SCRM baseline, and identify 
cybersecurity supply chain requirements and controls at the Level 3 operational level. The C-
SCRM plan should be revised and updated based on the output of cybersecurity supply chain 
monitoring.  
C-SCRM plans should:  
• Summarize the environment as determined in the Frame step, such as applicable policies, 
processes, and procedures based on enterprise and mission requirements currently 
implemented in the enterprise 
• State the role responsible for the plan, such as Risk Executive, Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), program manager, or system owner 
• Identify key contributors, such as CFO, Chief Operations Officer (COO), 
acquisition/contracting, procurement, C-SCRM PMO, system engineer, system security 
engineer, developer/maintenance engineer, operations manager, or system architect 
• Provide the applicable (per level) set of risk mitigation measures and controls resulting 
from the evaluation of alternatives (in the Respond step) 
• Provide tailoring decisions for selected controls, including the rationale for the decision 
• Describe feedback processes among the levels to ensure that cybersecurity supply chain 
interdependencies are addressed 
• Describe monitoring and enforcement activities (including auditing, if appropriate) 
applicable to the scope of each specific C-SCRM plan 
• If appropriate, state qualitative or quantitative measures to support the implementation of 
the C-SCRM plan and assess the effectiveness of the implementation72  
• Define a frequency for reviewing and revising the plan 
• Include criteria that would trigger revision, such as life cycle milestones, gate reviews, or 
significant contracting activities 
72 NIST SP 800-55, Rev. 1, Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security (July 2008), provides guidance on 
developing information security measures. Agencies can use general guidance in that publication to develop specific measures 
for their C-SCRM plans. See http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-55-Rev1/SP800-55-rev1.pdf.

• Include suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and 
other ICT/OT-related service providers in C-SCRM plans if they are made available as 
part of agreements 
Agencies may want to integrate C-SCRM controls into the respective system security plans or 
develop separate operational-level C-SCRM plans. At Level 3, the C-SCRM plan applies to 
high-and moderate-impact systems, per [FIPS 199]. Requirements and inputs from the enterprise 
C-SCRM strategy at Level 1 and the mission C-SCRM strategy and implementation plan at 
Level 2 should flow down and be used to guide the develop C-SCRM plans at Level 3. 
Conversely, the C-SCRM controls and requirements at Level 3 should be considered when 
developing and revising the requirements and controls applied at the higher levels. C-SCRM 
plans should be interconnected and reference each other when appropriate.  
Table G-9 summarizes the controls to be contained in Risk Response Frameworks at Level 1 and 
Level 2, the C-SCRM plans at Level 3, and examples of those controls.

RISK RESPONSE IMPLEMENTATION  
TASK 3-4: Implement the course of action selected to respond to risk. 
Enterprises should implement the C-SCRM plan in a manner that integrates the C-SCRM 
controls into the overall agency risk management processes. 
Outputs and Post Conditions  
The output of this step is a set of C-SCRM controls that address C-SCRM requirements and can 
be incorporated into the system requirements baseline and agreements with third-party providers. 
These requirements and resulting controls will be incorporated into the SDLC and other 
enterprise processes throughout the three levels.  
For general risk types, this step results in:  
• Selected, evaluated, and tailored C-SCRM controls that address identified risks; 
• Identified consequences of accepting or not accepting the proposed mitigations; and 
• Development and implementation of the C-SCRM plan. 
Monitor  
INPUTS AND PRECONDITIONS 
Monitor is the step in which enterprises 1) verify compliance, 2) determine the ongoing 
effectiveness of risk response measures, and 3) identify risk-impacting changes to enterprise 
information systems and environments of operation.  
Changes to the enterprise, mission and business processes, operations, or the supply chain can 
directly impact the enterprise’s cybersecurity supply chain. The Monitor step provides a 
mechanism for tracking such changes and ensuring that they are appropriately assessed for

impact (in the Assess step). If the cybersecurity supply chain is redefined as a result of 
monitoring, enterprises should coordinate with their suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers to resolve 
implications and mutual obligations. A critical component of the Monitor step includes the 
upward dissemination of information to inform higher level risk assessments (e.g., mission and 
business process assessment informs enterprise assessment). This ensures that enterprise leaders 
maintain visibility into risk conditions across the enterprise.  
Enterprises should monitor for supply chain risk events to reassess risk and determine 
appropriate risk responses. This should include determining whether the event has triggered an 
incident or compels the need for information sharing. Examples of supply chain risk events 
include:  
• Change of ownership, merger, or acquisition 
• Disruption to the supply chain 
• Continuity or emergency event that affects a source or its supply chain 
• Ransomware or other cybersecurity attack that affects a source or its supply chain 
• New information about a critical vulnerability that may or does affect technology 
used by the source and/or its supply chain 
• Discovery of a counterfeit or non-conforming product or component  
• Change in location for manufacturing or software development, especially 
changes from domestic to foreign locations 
• OEM no longer produces and/or supports a product or critical component of a 
product 
• Evidence of non-disclosed functionality or features of a covered article  
• Any notification that requires additional investigation to determine whether the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Federal Government’s data and 
information systems can be directly attributed to an attack involving the 
refurbishment, tampering, and counterfeiting of ICT products 
• Presence of covered articles produced by a prohibited or otherwise non-authorized 
source 
• Evidence of suspicious Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI)  
• Other changes that may negatively affect the risk profile of the source, the 
covered article, and/or the associated supply chain (e.g., loss of key personnel, 
degradation of the company’s financial health, etc.)  
Enterprises should integrate C-SCRM into existing continuous monitoring programs.73 In the 
event that a continuous monitoring program does not exist, C-SCRM can serve as a catalyst for 
establishing a comprehensive continuous monitoring program. Figure G-7 depicts the Monitor 
step with inputs and outputs along the three enterprise levels.  
73 NIST SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and Organizations 
(September 2011), describes how to establish and implement a continuous monitoring program. See
