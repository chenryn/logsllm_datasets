User: I'm working in a multiuser environment with the following setup:

Linux 64bits environment (users can login in to different servers).
Eclipse (IBM Eclipse RSA-RTE) 32bits. So Java VM, Eclipse and PyDev is 32bits.
Python 3 interpreter is only available for 64bits at this moment.

In the preferences for PyDev, I want to set the path to the Python interpreter like this:
/app/python/@sys/3.2.2/bin/python
In Eclipse/PyDev, @sys points to i386_linux26 even if the system actually is amd64_linux26. So if I do not explicitly write amd64_linux26 instead of @sys, PyDev will not be able to find the Python 3 interpreter which is only available for 64bits. The link works as expected outside Eclipse/PyDev, e.g. in the terminal.
Any ideas how to force Eclipse/PyDev to use the real value of @sys?
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: I don't really think there's anything that can be done on the PyDev side... it seems @sys is resolved based on the kind of process you're running (not your system), so, if you use a 64 bit vm (I think) it should work...
Other than that, you may have to provide the actual path instead of using @sys...
