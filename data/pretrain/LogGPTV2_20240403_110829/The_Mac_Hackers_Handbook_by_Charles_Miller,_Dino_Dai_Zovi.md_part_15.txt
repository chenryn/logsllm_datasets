### Bypassing Anti-Debugging Mechanisms

Fortunately, this anti-debugging mechanism can be easily bypassed. In Chapter 12, "Rootkits," we will demonstrate a method using kernel modules to defeat it. For now, we can use GDB manually. The fundamental idea is to prevent iTunes from successfully calling `ptrace()` with the `PT_DENY_ATTACH` request. We will intercept this function call in the debugger and ensure that when the `PT_DENY_ATTACH` parameter is passed, the function does nothing.

To achieve this, first, ensure that iTunes is not running. Then, start GDB and set a conditional breakpoint at `ptrace()`. This step is somewhat redundant since iTunes should not be calling `ptrace()`, but it's better to be safe. When the breakpoint is hit, have GDB return without executing the function. Place these commands in a GDB initialization file (`.gdbinit`):

```gdb
break ptrace
condition 1 *((unsigned int *) ($esp + 4)) == 0x1f
commands 1
return
c
end
```

#### Setting Up GDB

1. **Start GDB:**
   ```sh
   $ gdb /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes
   ```

2. **Load the GDB Initialization File:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) source itunes.gdb
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) run
   ```

4. **Detach from the Process:**
   After starting iTunes, you can safely detach from the process and debug or trace as needed.
   ```gdb
   (gdb) detach
   ```

#### Example GDB Session

```sh
$ gdb /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes
GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-768) (Tue Oct 2 04:07:49 UTC 2007)

```

Notice how the breakpoint is hit early in the process's lifetime. You now have a running instance of iTunes without the `P_LNOTRACE` flag set, allowing you to attach to it again at your convenience.

```sh
$ gdb -p 3757
GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-768) (Tue Oct 2 04:07:49 UTC 2007)

(gdb)
```

#### Using DTrace for Monitoring

DTrace also works well for monitoring. For example, if iTunes is displaying an episode of Chuck from Season 1, you can use DTrace to monitor file operations:

```sh
$ sudo dtrace -qs filemon.d 3757
open(/dev/autofs_nowait) = 20
open(/System/Library/Keyboard
Layouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle/Contents/Info.plist) = 21
close(21)
close(20)
open(/dev/autofs_nowait) = 20
open(/System/Library/Keyboard
Layouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/
InfoPlist.strings) = 21
close(21)
close(20)
close(20)
open(/.vol/234881026/6117526/07 Chuck Versus the Alma Mater.m4v) = 20
```

Order is restored to the universe.

### Conclusion

Before delving into exploitation techniques, it is crucial to understand how to explore the internals of applications. We discussed GDB and `ptrace` on Mac OS X, highlighting differences from more common implementations. We then explored DTrace, a kernel-level runtime application tracing mechanism, and wrote several small D programs to perform useful functions for security researchers, such as monitoring file usage, system calls, and memory allocations. We also covered the Mac OS X port of PyDbg, which allowed us to write Python scripts for debugging tasks like searching memory and in-memory fuzzing. Additionally, we showed how Pai Mei can be used for binary reverse engineering. Finally, we demonstrated how to circumvent Leopard’s anti-debugging measures.
