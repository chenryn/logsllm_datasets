**VSCode Version:** 1.0.0  
**OS Version:** Windows

I am a huge fan of this editor. It is incredibly responsive, and I find the processes of opening and editing files to be exceptionally fast.

However, I have encountered an issue with Emmet's abbreviation expansion in custom syntaxes, such as `.blade` and `.vue`. To attempt to resolve this, I tried adding the following configuration to my `settings.json`:

```json
"files.associations": {
    "*.blade.php": "html"
}
```

While this did enable Emmet to work, it also caused my Blade syntax highlighting extension to stop functioning. If there were a way for both Emmet and the syntax highlighting to work simultaneously, it would make VSCode even more perfect for me. 

It would be fantastic if a future release could include a setting that allows users to enable Emmet abbreviation expansion for specific file types directly in `settings.json` or another accessible location. In that case, I believe VSCode would be the best text editor in the world.
