I love this editor. it's awesome, very fast response, open, edit.  
but it's not support emmet expand abbreviations in custom syntax eg .blade,
.vue
i try to add "files.associations": {"*.blade.php": "html"}, emmet work but my
extension blade syntax hilighting not working. if it's can work together i
think my heart is got by vscode üëç
if next release has settings about enable emmet expand abbreviations in
settings.json or other place.  
i think it's wonderful text editor in this world.
Best regard
ps. sorry for my bad english
