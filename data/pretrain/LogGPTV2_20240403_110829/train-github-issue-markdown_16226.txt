Unless I am missing an existing configuration option (searched through the
default settings, nothing jumped out at me), VS Code will always default to
CRLF (at least on Windows).
For developers targeting cross platform (particularly with publishing packages
to npm, for example) it would be nice to be able to set a user setting to
default to LF instead of CRLF (or vice versa for other scenarios).
