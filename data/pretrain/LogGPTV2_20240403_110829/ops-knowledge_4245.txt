User: I am using Google App Engine for the first time, whenever I make requests using two instances of the application, the responses come sequentially.. 
For example, I opened two pages of the app's main page, made an AJAX request from one then refreshed the other, the page doesn't load until the first page gets its response.. so the server actually waits and responds to requests sequentially.. 
Is this an issue with the development server only? or am I missing something here?
Assistant: The Python dev_appserver is single-threaded and only serves one request at a time. The production environment, naturally, has no such restriction.
