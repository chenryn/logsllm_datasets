User: Is it possible to run cprofile on a mult-threaded python program that forks itself into a daemon process? I know you can make it work on multi thread, but I haven't seen anything on profiling a daemon.
Assistant: Well you can always profile it for a single process or single thread & optimize. After which make it multi-thread. Am I missing something here?
