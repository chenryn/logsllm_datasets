User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I force Windows Server 2003 to restart? So I'm logged onto a remote desktop session as Administrator. The CPU usage is pegged at 50% with the csrss.exe process running under the Console session as the culprit.

I can't log off the Console user from the Task Manager and I can't restart using "shutdown /r /f"

Is there any way I can force the server to restart or kill the Console session? There is no one else logged on to the server right now and I don't have physical access to reset it. Explorer is barely responsive but the task manager and command line and working fine.

Assistant: Have you tried taskkill.exe /pid &lt;pid&gt; /f for the CSRSS.EXE process?
