Foreword
Few would disagree when I say that the world of technology has grown ever more complex
over the last couple of decades since the internet came to prominence. More and more
products have arrived, promising us solutions to tame the growing complexity. Along with
the promises come a raft of experts, there to help us through what is actually yet more
complexity.
2012 saw the first release of Ansible. By 2013, it was gaining significant traction since its
promise of power through simplicity was not an empty one. Here was a technology rooted
in a simple truth—solving problems with technology really means solving problems for
people. Therefore, people matter. A tool that is easy to pick up and learn? What an amazing
thought! Early adopters were those who saw through the functionality list to realize that
here was a people-pleasing game changer.
I first met James at one of his technical Ansible talks a few years ago. It was still relatively
early days for Ansible, although we'd just been acquired by Red Hat. At that first meeting, I
realized that here was a fellow who understood the link between people and Ansible's
powerful simplicity. I've been lucky enough to see James speak on a number of occasions
since, with two standout talks coming to mind.
At AnsibleFest 2018 in Austin, Texas, James gave a great talk about a client engagement
where he presided over a business-critical database upgrade—on a Friday afternoon.
What's the golden rule we all tout in tech? Don't make business-critical changes on a
Friday! Yet James's charismatic storytelling had the audience enthralled. The second
occasion was more recent, at an Ansible London meetup. Taking a very different approach
to the usual tech-heavy talks, James presented the audience with a tale of positive
psychology, a story that had Ansible as the underlying tool supporting people. It turned
out to be a great success, sparking a lively interaction across the audience during the Q&A
session that followed.
Scalability isn't just about a technology; it is about people. If you want a technology to scale,
it must be easy for people to adopt, to master, and to share. James is a model of scalability
himself, as he so readily shares his knowledge. He also shows in this book that Ansible is
an orchestrator, a conductor of the symphony if you like, with the ability to span an
enterprise. I'm sure you'll enjoy reading it as much as I've enjoyed every interaction I've
had with James.

I've worked alongside James for several years and consider him to be one of the foremost
Ansible experts in the world. I've been witness to his help in the digital modernization
efforts of large and small organizations with the help of automation and DevOps practices.
In Hands-On Enterprise Automation on Linux, James generously shares his experience with a
practical, no-nonsense approach to managing heterogeneous Linux environments. If you
learn best through a hands-on approach, then this is the book for you. James provides
plenty of in-depth examples in each chapter so that you can cement your understanding
and feel prepared to take Ansible into a live environment.

Thanks to my wife and daughter for putting up with the late nights and early mornings.
Iain Grant is a senior engineer with over 20 years' experience as an IT professional, in both
small and enterprise companies, where he has held a wide variety of positions, including
trainer, programmer, firmware engineer, and system administrator. During this time, he
has worked on multiple operating systems, ranging from OpenVMS, through Windows, to
Linux, where he has also contributed to the Alpha Linux kernel. He currently works in an
enterprise environment looking after over 300 Linux servers, with responsibility for their
automation and management.
I would recommend this book as standard reading for any professional or senior engineer
working with Linux. The areas covered provide you with excellent guidance and examples
of a controlled build, as well as a managed and secure environment, resulting in an easier
life for anyone looking after small or large Linux estates.
