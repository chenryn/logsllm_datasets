error  analysis  in  signal  processing  structures,  digital 
filters  [Chapter 5,  241  and  fast  transform  implementa- 
tions [Chapter 7,  l].  However, the motivations in these 
situations were to measure the effects of roundoff  noises 
introduced  during  arithmetic  operations  and  to  gauge 
the  impact of  quantizing scaling coefficients.  In  these 
error analyses, the imperfect operations are modeled by 
including a small random variable with every significant 
arithmetic  calculation.  The  statistics  governing  these 
variables are quite small  reflecting the precision  of  the 
arithmetic  computations.  Since the  sytems  are  linear, 
superposition applies.  The impact of each noise source 
is evaluated separately with  the total  effects determined 
by  the aggregate results at the outputs.  Generally, only 
first and  second  order moments are  evaluated to guide 
designs. 
The  role  of  modeling  errors  for  fault  tolerance  pur- 
poses  is to describe failures by  a random  variable with 
possibly  large  statistics.  Nevertheless,  modem  signal 
processing textbooks do not  delve as deeply  into noise 
analysis,  probably  because  of  the  wide  availibility  of 
floating point arithmetic units which have large dynamic 
ranges as opposed to the older fixed-point arithmetic em- 
ployed in earlier digital filters and transform assemblies. 
For fault tolerance error modeling purposes, an error 
value, say E  as shown in Figure 3, is added to line r an

Furthermore,  the  linear  mapping  F ( k )  is  nonsingular

all theoutputerrorvectors(pattems)vLk), r  = 1,2, ..., N ,  
form a basis for the output space (Remember the unit vec-

of  linearly  independent  vectors  Ai“),  Ar), ... ,A$)  can 
be constructed.  These N  vectors can  be collected  in an 
N  x  N  matrix. 
The linearly  independent output error  vectors  can  be 
consolidated into  a  nonsingular matrix  V ( k )  which,  of 
course, is identical to F(”.

it would be possible to form a linear combination of the 
functionals (viewed in the dual space [17]), determining 
a composite linear functional  A(k)  that  would guarantee 
nonzero values regardless of which output error parttern

However,  the  output  error patterns  are only  linearly 
independent  when  derived  from the same  stage's  input 
lines. Nevertheless, it is desirable to find a composite lin- 
ear functional defined by vector b that will be "sensitive" 
to ALL output error patterns.

The column  vector b, N  x  1, is related  to the complex 
scalers collected into a new vector y , 1 x n.!V. This may 
be seen by defining a matrix A constructed by concatenat- 
ing the dual space matrices A ( k ) * ,  equations (24). 
The  solution  y* to  equation  (29b)  is  overdetermined, 
but there are some constraints that are reasonable.  First, 
when  b  is  chosen  for  convenience  of  implementation, 
it should have  all nonzero entries.  This way  any single 
error coming from the final  stage will automatically  be 
checked in the syndrome calculation process.  Also, as a 
heuristic, all  the entries of y should be nonzero.  These 
values effectively represent  the gain from a single error 
position (line and stage) to the syndrome output. Hence, 
if any y term were zero, the checking system would have 
to rely  on other linear functionals to sense the effects  of 
such an error. 
A  design  methodology emerges.  Select  the compo- 
nents  of  b  conveniently  and  nonzero.  Then  check  if 
there is a y vector  providing nonzero gains  to the syn- 
drome  output  from  every  error  location.  Fortunately, 
these two  mismatched  vectors  b  and  y are  interrelated 
through  the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse  of  A*.  This 
pseudo-inverse has a useful characteristic. 
A*A*'  =  in^

y* = b*A*? 
(30b.I 
This  pseudo-inverse when  constructed  using  the  SVD 
decomposition of A* is unique [Sect. 8.1 1, 91.  Such cal- 
culation  capabilities are generally  contained  in  modern 
computer algebra packages. 
On the other hand,  linear algebra theory  does not  re- 
move all possibilities of an error pattem being annihilated 
by the composite linear functional b as defined by equa- 
tion (28b). To see the large number of such possibilities, 
consider the linear functional related to b and an error pat- 
resulting from an error on line TO and stage bo.
