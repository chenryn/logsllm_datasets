User: How to use the Git version control tool to manage code and code collaboration and release?
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system used to manage versions of code so that team members can collaborate on developing and maintaining code. Here are some steps to use Git to manage code: 1. Install Git. On Windows and Linux, you can download the installer from the official Git website. On Mac OS, you can download Git from Homebrew or MacPorts. 2. Initialize the Git repository. Create a new Git repository using the Git init command. Open a terminal in the project folder and type git init. 3. Add the code. Use the Git add command to add code to a Git repository. Add code to the staging area, ready to commit. 4. Submit the code. Use the Git commit command to commit the code to the Git repository. Submissions must include a submission description describing all additions and changes. 5. Create a branch. Create new branches using the Git branch command. The new branch provides an isolated development environment, allowing you to develop experimentally without affecting the main branch. 6. Switch branches. Use the Git checkout command to switch branches. 7. Merge the branches. Use the Git merge command to merge the branch into the master branch. This operation needs to be done carefully to avoid accidental damage. 8. Push to the remote repository. Use the Git push command to push the local code to the remote warehouse. This operation requires the correct configuration of the permissions and access rights of the Git remote repository. 9. Pull code changes. Use the Git fetch and Git merge commands to pull remote code changes and merge them into local branches. 10. Tag. Use Git tag to create and manage tags for marking important code versions or releases. 11. Resolve conflicts. Conflicts can occur if multiple team members edit the same code file at the same time. Use the Git diff command to review code changes, and the Git merge command to resolve conflicts. 12. Record the change history. Git tracks the change history of each file, and the commit history and details of each commit can be viewed using the Git log command. By using the Git version control tool, teams can efficiently manage code, collaborate and receive feedback, making project development smoother.
