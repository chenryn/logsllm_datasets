when i press alt the F in the File menu is underlined yet when i press ALT+F i
get editor:move-to-end-of-word?  
and when i press ALT+H to supposedly access the help menu i get editor:delete-
to-beginning-of-word?  
the rest of the menu keyboard shortcuts work  
conflict only happens when an editor window has focus i guess  
it works fine when for example all files are closed or no editor has focus  
i am on windows
