Assistant: To configure the mail server to support the enterprise to send emails in batches and ensure that the mails can be delivered normally, you can follow the steps below: 1. Choose the appropriate mail server software, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, Postfix, Sendmail, etc., and choose according to your needs and budget. 2. Configure DNS reverse resolution records to ensure that the IP address of the mail server can be associated with the correct domain name. 3. Configure SPF records to identify the company's mail server and sender's address to the outside world, and help the receiving mail server to authenticate the sender's IP address. 4. Allow the sending IP address and port of the mail server to pass through the firewall. 5. Configure anti-spam settings, including blacklist and whitelist, keyword filtering, email address verification, content filtering, etc., to ensure compliance of sender address and email content. 6. For multiple recipients, consider sending emails in batches to avoid sending a large number of emails at one time and causing the mail server to crash due to response. 7. Ensure mail server supervision, including logging and performance monitoring, as well as timely maintenance and updates. By configuring the mail server according to the above steps, the enterprise can send emails in batches and ensure that the emails can be delivered normally.
