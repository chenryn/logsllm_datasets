ABSTRACT
Compromised smart meters sending false power consumption data
in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) may have drastic con-
sequences on the smart grid’s operation. Most existing defense
models only deal with electricity theft from individual customers
(isolated attacks) using supervised classi(cid:27)cation techniques that do
not o(cid:29)er scalable or real time solutions. Furthermore, the cyber and
interconnected nature of AMIs can also be exploited by organized
adversaries who have the ability to orchestrate simultaneous data
falsi(cid:27)cation attacks after compromising several meters, and also
have more complex goals than just electricity theft. In this paper,
we (cid:27)rst propose a real time semi-supervised anomaly based con-
sensus correction technique that detects the presence and type of
smart meter data falsi(cid:27)cation, and then performs a consensus cor-
rection accordingly. Subsequently, we propose a semi-supervised
consensus based trust scoring model, that is able to identify the
smart meters injecting false data. The main contribution of the
proposed approach is to provide a practical framework for com-
promised smart meter identi(cid:27)cation that (i) is not supervised (ii)
enables quick identi(cid:27)cation (iii) scales classi(cid:27)cation error rates bet-
ter for larger sized AMIs; (iv) counters threats from both isolated
and orchestrated attacks; and (v) simultaneously works for a va-
riety of data falsi(cid:27)cation types. Extensive experimental validation
using two real datasets from USA and Ireland, demonstrates the
ability of our proposed method to identify compromised meters in
near real time across di(cid:29)erent datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the building
blocks of the smart grid technology, responsible for collecting data
on loads and consumer’s electricity consumption [16]. Such data
are usually collected by smart meters installed on the customer site,
and are expected to play a pivotal role in current and future smart
grids. For example, AMI data will be at the basis of critical tasks
such as automated billing and pricing, demand response, forecast,
load adjustments [31], and management of daily and critical peak
shifts. Hence, the integrity of AMI data is of utmost importance.
However, data falsi(cid:27)cation attacks target the integrity of AMI data.
In the literature, defense against the falsi(cid:27)cation of electric-
ity consumption data, has been mostly focused on electricity
theft, [9, 13, 14, 23], where individual customers are the primary
adversaries, who report lower than actual usage for lesser electric-
ity bills. Since the actually measured reading of power consump-
tion is reduced, such an adversarial strategy is a deductive mode
of data falsi(cid:27)cation. Such attacks from individual rogue customers
are usually uncoordinated and we term them as isolated attacks.
However, it is recognized that the cyber and interconnected
nature of AMIs can be exploited by more organized adversaries,
(e.g., organized criminals [30] and business rivals [10, 27]), who
are more equipped to bypass cryptographic defense, compromise
several smart meters, and alter a large or small amounts of data
simultaneously, thereby signi(cid:27)cantly impacting the smart grid’s
operations [10, 13, 30]. We term such attacks as orchestrated at-
tacks. Orchestrated physical attacks tampering the meter hardware
to produce false data was reported in [29, 30]. Thus, cryptography
or network intrusion alone cannot protect against this threat.
The goals of organized adversaries may not be restricted to mon-
etary bene(cid:27)ts on the customer billing side resulting from electric-
ity theft. As an example, higher than actual power consumption
can be reported by a meter as a byproduct of static and dynamic
load altering attack [17] or hardware tampering a(cid:29)ecting both cus-
tomers and utilities. Such an attack is termed as an additive mode
of data falsi(cid:27)cation. An additive attack launched by a utility on its
rival company’s meters, may induce loss of business con(cid:27)dence by
the customers of the victim company, due to higher bills. The ex-
pected future use of AMI data for demand response, forecast and
load planning may induce additive attacks to bene(cid:27)t customers by

drawing undue incentives during demand response [1]. Note that,
an organized attacker may also perform a balancing additive and
deductive attacks to evade detection methods that use mean aggre-
gates, which are termed as camou(cid:30)age mode of data falsi(cid:27)cation.
Previous works on orchestrated or isolated attacks have many
disadvantages. Classi(cid:27)cation based techniques use computation-
ally expensive Multi-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [8, 9],
Neural Networks [7] and only focus on retrospective identi(cid:27)ca-
tion (takes 6 months to 2 years), lacking the possibility of detect-
ing the attacks or compromised meters before serious damages.
Other works [1, 11] utilize a complete supervised approach by
maintaining continuous (cid:27)ne grained meter speci(cid:27)c historical evi-
dence which is impractical and error prone for large scale AMI net-
works, and requires separate training for particular attack types.
State based detector needs special hardware which is very costly
as elaborated in Section 2. Some consensus based approaches
use traditional measures of central tendency such as median and
mean [14, 22, 23] or their variants. Such consensus measures get
easily a(cid:29)ected by larger margins of false data or larger fractions of
compromised meters (when using instantaneous consensus met-
rics). They also fail under camou(cid:30)age attacks (typical in orches-
trated attacks), may lead to larger error rates (when using historical
consensus metrics), since the mean aggregate of power consump-
tion data readily changes (proved later by real datasets).
In this paper, we propose an anomaly based consensus correc-
tion scheme and a semi-supervised learning based trust scoring
model, that detects occurrence as well as the speci(cid:27)c type of falsi-
(cid:27)cation of power consumption data (referred to as attack context),
and then identify the compromised meters injecting such false data
in an AMI, regardless of isolated or orchestrated attacks. Speci(cid:27)-
cally, we propose a novel metric based on harmonic to arithmetic
mean ratios of daily power consumption to detect anomalies and
infer the attack context. Based on the inferred attack context, we
calculate a resilient mixture mean and standard deviation as an ap-
proximate consensus measures that weaken the alterations caused
by the false data from orchestrated attacks. Subsequently, a set of
discrete rating levels is associated to each meter over time using
the proximity of its reported data to this resilient mixture mean.
Then, a Folded Gaussian distribution based weighing procedure is
used to assign weights to each of the discrete rating levels. Based
on rating levels and weights observed over a time window, a trust
value is calculated per meter that classi(cid:27)es compromised meters.
We validated our model through extensive experiments on real
datasets acquired from two di(cid:29)erent AMI infrastructures with
varying sizes and regions. Results show that our proposed method
is able to detect and decipher additive, deductive, and camou(cid:30)age
attacks launched by organized adversaries in real time. We demon-
strate that our method is robust to a high fraction of compromised
meters (upto 75%), is able to identify compromised meters from
non-compromised ones over margins of false data, thus making it
scalable for large sized AMI. Additionally, our method identi(cid:27)es
against isolated attacks from individual meters. We compare our
results with three existing works to show improvement.
2 LIMITATIONS OF RELATED WORK
Existing works on AMI data falsi(cid:27)cation can be classi(cid:27)ed into
Classi(cid:27)cation based, State Estimation based, and Consensus based
methods. Classi(cid:27)cation based approaches [7–9] require extensive
training phases and multi-class SVMs for each customer separately,
in order to detect electricity thefts. They are computationally com-
plex and only allow retrospective identi(cid:27)cation. A study compar-
ing classi(cid:27)cation methods [7] concluded that the accuracy of most
of these models are only 60% to 70%, although they su(cid:29)er from
privacy intrusion and complexity issues.
State based detection techniques [6, 12, 13] in contrast, require
additional monitoring hardware deployed at various points across
the AMI and distribution network for consistency checks. Addi-
tional hardware requirement is costly to the extent that it has been
recognized as a practical deterrent for utility providers to use such
solutions in scale. Some works monitor non-technical loss (NTL)
at the transformer meter. However, in [7] it is observed that NTL
could vary due to large number of factors other than attacks (e.g.,
legitimate changes due to unexpected weather) and hence su(cid:29)ers
from high number of false alarms. Moreover, the NTL approach
cannot detect for camou(cid:30)age or load altering induced attacks.
Consensus based methods [14, 22, 23] use smoothened moving
average of median or mean power consumption for detection, fol-
lowed by information theory to identify meters. Most works ex-
cept [14] assume isolated electricity theft from a small number of
malicious meters that does not greatly bias the consensus. But this
assumption on unbiased consensus may not hold for organized
adversaries with higher attack budgets launching orchestrated at-
tacks. Some works such as [22, 23], use historical mean/median
power consumption for comparison of bad behavior. However, the
mean power consumption varies readily due to contextual factors
such as weather, customer habits etc. as shown later from studies
with our real datasets. Some works [1, 11] use a supervised learn-
ing of historical proximity patterns of each meter with instanta-
neous consensus, but fails for higher fractions of compromised me-
ters (≥ 40%). Additionally, supervised approaches become cumber-
some for large scale grids due to large training sets and require
labels which may not be available or accurate. Another major lim-
itation these methods, is that the assumed margins of false data
per meter are usually (cid:27)xed and are also typically very high (600W-
1500W), which favors easier detection. As shown later, the mean
consumption can easily get a(cid:29)ected by both larger margins of
false data or legitimate consumption changes (e.g., sudden weather
changes), which increases errors. This is evident from [14, 22],
where (cid:27)ne grained monitoring still yields accuracy of about 62%.
Note that cryptography based approaches are not enough since
physical attacks can also cause data falsi(cid:27)cation [29, 30].

DESCRIPTION
t at the end of time slot t. We model P i
We consider a set of N smart meters reporting power consump-
tion data to a data concentrator periodically. Let the i-th smart me-
ter report a datum P i
t as
the realizations of a random variable (r.v.) P i denoting the power
consumption distribution of the i-th smart meter. A Neighborhood
Area Network (NaN), formed by a collection of houses is governed
by a NaN gateway node, that may act as data concentrators col-
lecting data from multiple smart meters in an area. Multiple NAN
gateways may be connected to form a Field Area Network (FAN),

governed by a FAN gateway, which in turn is connected to the Util-
ity Wide Area Network (WAN).
Decentralized defense models are deployed at either NAN or
FAN gateways while centralized detection frameworks are de-
ployed at the WAN [3]. Since the datasets did not reveal the ac-
tual topology, we show results on smaller subsets of meters and as
a whole, to mimic both deployment possibilities and understand
performance scalability with varying micro-grid size N .
3.1 Dataset Description
To study the distribution of P i , we investigated hourly (i.e., t
slotted hourly) reported real power consumption datasets of 700
houses from Austin, Texas [25] and 5000 houses from Dublin,
Ireland [26] that belong to residential customers. We observed
that each P i follows an approximate lognormal distribution in the
Texas dataset. We also observed that all such log-normal distri-
butions are clustered close to each other such that the variance
between them is not arbitrarily large. The evidence is shown in
Fig. 1(a). Given this observation, we claim that the combination of
the individual lognormals can be well approximated by a mixture
distribution which is also log-normal (as evident from Fig. 1(b)). We
denote Pmix as the random variable with approximate lognormal
mixture distribution considering all houses in the grid. The trends
from Texas dataset, also matches with trends from the same exper-
iments over the Irish dataset with similar results on consumption
for a di(cid:29)erent population for di(cid:29)erent years as shown in Figs. 2 (a)
and 2(b), proving generality of observations.
