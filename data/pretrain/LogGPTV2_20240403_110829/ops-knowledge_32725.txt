User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the ambient temperature of a node and gige software component over a period of time. The temperature ranges from 25 to 35 degrees Celsius. There were also two warnings and one critical log from the gige software component.
