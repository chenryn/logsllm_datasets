User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can you use a local path for mandatory profiles? I run the network at a small college, and we're trying to improve how we handle public lab computers.

One thing I'm considering is using mandatory profiles. As part of the design for this, I want to know if I can set the profile to be stored on the local system. We would then deploy the profile to a folder on the local C: drive of each computer as part of our imaging process. This would help reduce network latency for loading the profile, and also allow us to have a slightly different profile depending on which lab you log in to.

Will this work, or does it have to be a network share? If it has to be a network share, will \\localhost work?

Assistant: i had the same problem. I have to set up a P.C. classroom for students with mandatory profiles without the use of an active directory domain server.
I needed to setup and customize a LOCAL mandatory profile on a sample machine for replication.
I wrote some notes to describe the working solution, in italian, below an attempt to translate it (i apologize for my poor english)


login as a user in the Administrators group
From "User Management" create user student with password student and set:
-Password never expires
-User can not change password
Start Menu > Change User > log in as user student
Log Off
Create a new folder in C:\Users\ and give it a name like defstudprofile.v2.
Login as Administrator and copy the profile "DEFAULT" (the default system profile) to the newly created folder using the System Settings menu > Advanced > User Profiles Settings > BUTTON "Copy to ...".


  IMPORTANT! Before you copy use the "Change" to allow the group "Authenticated Users" use of the new profile.


This operation overwrites the entire contents of the folder 'defstudprofile.v2' with the contents of the default profile, but allows 'Authenticated Users' to use it.
Menu "Edit Local Users and Groups" > user "student" > "Profile" - enter in the "Profile Path" box the path of the folder defstudprofile.v2 ... remembering that the folder must be specified without the .v2 extension. so the path becomes C:\Users\defstudprofile
Log Off
login again as user student
Customize the desktop settings, the home page of the browsers, the proxy, and anything else you need blocked or changed
Log Off
Log back in as user student and verify that the settings are all stored.
Before you continue you should Log off and back several times, opening several applications to make sure they are all properly configured.
Log in as an administrator. Go to the the C:\Users\defstudprofile.v2 profile folder  and rename the ntuser.dat file to ntuser.man
Log Off
DONE! login as student and try to change some settings - disconnect and go back. The profile student is locked!


Further customizations of the mandatory profile can be done by renaming ntuser.man back to ntuser.dat to unlock the profile, and setting the file back to ntuser.man again to re-lock it.
