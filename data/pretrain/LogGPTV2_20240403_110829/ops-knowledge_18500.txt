**Using Local Paths for Mandatory Profiles in a Public Lab Environment**

I manage the network at a small college, and we are looking to improve how we handle public lab computers. One option I am considering is the use of mandatory profiles. As part of this design, I need to know if it is possible to store these profiles locally on each computer. Our plan is to deploy the profile to a folder on the local C: drive of each computer as part of our imaging process. This approach would help reduce network latency when loading the profile and allow us to have slightly different profiles depending on which lab the user logs into.

**Is it Possible to Use a Local Path for Mandatory Profiles?**

Will this work, or does the profile need to be stored on a network share? If a network share is required, will `\\localhost` work?

**Setting Up a Local Mandatory Profile Without Active Directory**

I faced a similar challenge when setting up a PC classroom for students with mandatory profiles, without using an Active Directory domain server. I needed to create and customize a local mandatory profile on a sample machine for replication. Below are the steps I followed, translated from my original Italian notes (apologies for any language errors).

1. **Create and Configure the Student User Account:**
   - Log in as a user in the Administrators group.
   - From "User Management," create a user named "student" with the password "student."
   - Set the following options:
     - Password never expires
     - User cannot change password

2. **Log In as the Student User:**
   - Start Menu > Change User > Log in as user "student."
   - Log off.

3. **Create and Prepare the Profile Folder:**
   - Create a new folder in `C:\Users\` and name it `defstudprofile.v2`.
   - Log in as Administrator.
   - Copy the default system profile to the newly created folder:
     - System Settings menu > Advanced > User Profiles Settings > BUTTON "Copy to..."
     - Before copying, use the "Change" option to allow the group "Authenticated Users" to use the new profile.
   - This operation overwrites the entire contents of the `defstudprofile.v2` folder with the contents of the default profile but allows "Authenticated Users" to use it.

4. **Set the Profile Path for the Student User:**
   - Menu "Edit Local Users and Groups" > user "student" > "Profile"
   - Enter the path of the `defstudprofile.v2` folder in the "Profile Path" box, but omit the `.v2` extension. The path should be `C:\Users\defstudprofile`.

5. **Customize the Profile:**
   - Log in again as the user "student."
   - Customize the desktop settings, browser home pages, proxy settings, and any other necessary configurations.
   - Log off and log back in as the user "student" to verify that the settings are saved.
   - Repeat the log-off and log-in process several times, opening various applications to ensure they are all properly configured.

6. **Lock the Profile:**
   - Log in as an administrator.
   - Navigate to the `C:\Users\defstudprofile.v2` profile folder.
   - Rename the `ntuser.dat` file to `ntuser.man`.
   - Log off.

**Verification:**
- Log in as the student user and try to change some settings. Log off and log back in to confirm that the profile is locked and no changes persist.

**Further Customizations:**
- To make further customizations to the mandatory profile, rename `ntuser.man` back to `ntuser.dat` to unlock the profile. After making the necessary changes, rename the file back to `ntuser.man` to re-lock the profile.
