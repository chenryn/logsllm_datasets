User: Trying to do HelloWorld on GoogleAppEngine, but getting the following error.
C:\LearningGoogleAppEngine\HelloWorld>dev_appserver.py helloworld

I've found posts on GoogleCode, StackO regarding this issue. But no matter what I try, I still can't overcome this error.
Python version installed on Windows 7 machine is: 2.7.3
GAE Launcher splash screen displays the following:
Release 1.7.0
Api versions: ['1']
Python: 2.5.2
wxPython : 2.8.8.1(msw-unicode) 
Can someone help?
Assistant: just had the exact same error messages: I found that restarting Windows fixed everything and I did not have to deviate from the YAML or py file given on the google helloworld python tutorial.
