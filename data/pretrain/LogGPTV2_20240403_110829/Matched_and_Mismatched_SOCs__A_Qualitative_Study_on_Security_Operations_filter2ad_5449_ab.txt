performed on the transcribed interviews [17].
Our study was exempted by our Institutional Review Board (IRB),
as our questions did not measure individual behaviors. Despite this,
we still followed the same ethics and privacy requirements that an
IRB would normally enforce. When we transcribed the interviews,
we anonymized the participant’s name, the organization’s name,
and all personally identifiable information. The audio records of
the interviews are kept encrypted.
Participant Recruitment. We recruited participants in two steps.
In the first step, we contacted SOC-related individuals from vari-
ous industry sectors through multiple vectors including searching
profiles on LinkedIn, attending online security related business we-
binars, attending industry security events and conferences across
the U.S., and asking known contacts. We sent each of these indi-
viduals an email with details about our research study, interview
procedure, the motivation behind the research study, information
regarding the data anonymization process, and potential benefits to
the participants and their organizations. Unfortunately, only those
in our known contact list replied to our request, and some of them
agreed to participate. Throughout our search for potential partici-
pants, we recruited ten of our participants through emails and two
of our participants at industry security events and conferences.

thus cannot enforce security operations effectively.
Network information helps a SOC to understand an organiza-
tion’s security posture and respond to security incidents. The in-
formation is of different types, such as “network architecture doc-
umentation,” “list of devices in network zone models” (P18), “full
asset inventory,” and “configuration management database” (P5).
For example, P18 stated that the situational awareness (SA) (Sec-
tion 4.1.7) is impacted by the level of visibility:
In terms of the clients that we have on board, our situational
awareness is confined to the devices that are on board. We had
several cases that they were sending alerts from devices that
we never agreed to receive events from.
In addition, P5 highlighted the impact of the incompleteness of
network visibility on response speed:
We do not have a full asset inventory, that is a big constraint
(for fast response). We do not have configuration management
database, that is a big constraint (for fast response).
The reason for incomplete network visibility is multi-faceted. In-
ternally, the issue may be due to the structural setup of SOCs. For
example, a tiered SOC with a hierarchical setup that is assigned
limited visibility of incidents and machines to analysts at different
tiers, described by P3:
SOCs that are tiered will have limited visibility based on its
tier because a SOC analyst can accidentally make a mistake
during escalation.
Externally, incompleteness may be caused by the improper man-
agement or operation from another department. In specific, P18
mentioned the lack of information maintenance and the lack of the
communication between IT operations and security teams:
(The information the SOC requests) is not always up to date. [...]
(The SOC’s receiving alerts from unknown devices) is usually
because the IT ops and security teams are not necessarily the
same people and messages get lost and things like that.
P7 stated that visibility is impacted because of the administrators
breaking organizational rules. In this case, the SOC monitors a
large network that is connected to smaller sub-networks controlled
by different administrators, and P7 observed scenarios where ad-
ministrators decide not to follow pre-determined organizational
guidelines in creating their infrastructure or do not report new
devices that they connect to the network, which negatively impacts
the overall visibility of the SOC.
P4 also complained about the company employees’ disobeying
the rules:
The company as a whole push for stronger device management
and identification but it is a very difficult thing at a global
scale. Sometimes, somebody does not necessarily bound to the
same standards so they will just throw some routers to get the
networks working.
Also, the incompleteness is due to the nature of the organization,
which requires flexibility of device connectivity. For example, P∗1
works for a particular sector with special requirements which makes
it impossible to have high visibility all the time, given the fact that
1Our study includes a limited number of industry sectors, and this quote contains one of those
sectors. Therefore, we anonymized our participant’s ID to protect their identity against the possi-
bility of de-anonymization.

study. Both coders had similar backgrounds, with only the pri-
mary researcher having previous SOC knowledge. The primary
researcher guided the second coder, in concepts of qualitative re-
search studies and related methodologies, techniques for coding
interviews, and SOC knowledge.
After the coding procedure, we calculated the Cohen’s Kappa
coefficient as a representative of inter-coder reliability score. The
Cohen’s Kappa coefficient for this study is 0.71, which Landis et
al. [30] stated as a substantial score of agreement for categorical
data.
4 SOC ISSUES
In this section, we discuss SOC issues that we uncovered from the
interviews. Recall from Section 3 that questions such as budget
plan and technique deployment strategy are manager-only due to
the scope of work. For the issues from the questions answered by
both analysts and managers, we calculate the respective ratiosof
the participants agree with the issue, and we compare the ratios
between analysts and managers, as shown in Table 2. We also sort
the issues by the difference of the agreement between analysts
and managers. Based on the sorted results, shown in Figure 2, we
observe a gap in the analyst-manager difference of agreement: while
most of the issues are under 20% difference, three of them are around
30% or above. In this paper, we call the issues with less than 20%
difference the matched issues, whereas the ones with greater than
30% difference the mismatched issues. We will introduce the two
types of issues separately, followed by the other issues identified
by manager-only or interviewee-specific questions.
4.1 Matched Issues
Here, we discuss the issues that our participants have the most
agreement. We selected them by observing the gap in the analyst-
manager difference of agreement, shown in Figure 2.
4.1.1 Low Visibility on Devices and Network Topology
The lack of network visibility is the most common issue in our
participant’s SOCs: 71.43% of analysts and 60% of the managers,
including both outsourced and internal SOCs, raised the concern

many personal devices will be actively connected to the network
at any time:
Given the fact that this is a university, the expectation is that
each student brings at least four of their own devices to every
class. Then you start bringing in the professors and various
departments who want their own PCs and researchers who are
running high compute performance clusters under their desks.
So, there is not a possible way to list all these machines.
To mitigate the incomplete network visibility issue, avoidable or un-
avoidable, the participants talked about the solutions that have been
working effectively or will potentially work. P∗1, the participant
who works for the university with specific requirements on flexible
device connections, stated that incomplete visibility had “not been
a problem” for them due to effective tracking of all information
through their SIEM (Security Information and Event Management),
by having authentication clusters, and by actively watching pack-
ages. When an incident happens, they look for the person who was
authenticated to that machine instead of the machine itself. Also,
P4 considered that the visibility problem would be mitigated “if
they had a system that would notify them when new machines are
introduced on the network.”
4.1.2 Inferior Defense Against Specific Types of Attacks
In our interview, we asked our participants about the attacks that
they previously encountered from the aspects of victim specification,
attacker specification, and attack types. We also asked them about
the most challenging attack that they experienced while working
at SOCs.
Victim specialty. We categorized attacks as general attacks, in-
dustry-specific attacks, and organization-specific attacks, which
are attacks targeting the general public, the specific industry sector,
and the specific organization, respectively. We asked the intervie-
wees about their experiences on each type of attack. Among all the
participants, fifteen participants stated that they mostly encounter
the general and basic kind of attacks that are not tailored, espe-
cially for an industry or an organization. Ten of our participants
stated that they experience industry-specific attacks on occasion,
such as tailored phishing attacks exclusively for a particular sector.
Eight participants stated that they experience organization-specific
attacks in which an attacker targets a specific organization with a
clearly defined goal in mind, such as compromising confidential
data that is only kept within a particular organization.
Attacker specification. We classified attackers into individual
attacks and nation-state sponsored attacks, and we asked the inter-
viewees to compare the difficulty of defending against both attacks.
According to nine participants, attacks that are the most difficult to
defend against are nation-state sponsored attacks. One of the stated
reasons was the nature of these attacks: participants argued that
these attackers have bountiful resources, even more than the SOC.
Participants also pointed out that these types of attackers have ade-
quate time for the reconnaissance phase and find the best strategy
to attack their target network. Regarding nation-state sponsored
attacks, P16 said:
I think a lot of foreign adversaries are hard. We see traffic
coming from another country, another nation and we are able
to quickly block that traffic. But, these foreign adversaries,
they buy different domain names, different IP spaces. It is very
difficult to fully block that particular person ahead of time. So,
you are constantly trying to defend against someone that is
what I would consider a moving target.
The participant suggested that a SOC should provide proactive
monitoring and a powerful incident response team that has access
to high-quality threat intelligence to defend against such attackers.
Attack Types. We divided attacks into remote exploits, phishing,
denial of service, and so on, and we asked the interviewees the
experience of defending against each type of attack. Phishing is the
most common attack mentioned by fifteen participants. Except for
P8, our participant chose not to share further information regarding
the attacks that they previously encountered given the confidential
nature of those details.
The reason for phishing being the most common attacks mostly
varies; however, three participants (P2, P9, and P12) from the same
section vector similarly stated that they receive more phishing
attempts because their industry sector is more prone to phishing
attacks. Specifically, P∗1 gave an example and said:
From an airline standpoint, we see that our company is spoofed,
and it looked like a web check-in but with malware.
Furthermore, we asked the interviewees about solutions for phish-
ing attacks. P6 mentioned “using tools that can prevent phishing
emails” before they reach their mail server. Two of our participants
(P7 and P10), stated that proper training is the “only way” to pre-
vent phishing attacks. Regarding a previous successful phishing
attempt, P8 provided details of such an incident that had severe
consequences in which the employee was trained specifically for
phishing in the last 30 days:
A secretary to a researcher was attacked. It was a very well-
crafted phishing attack, and the machine got compromised.
Based on the information in the mailbox and the system, they
were able to pivot and able to hack into the mail server. From
there, the attacker was able to monitor the actions that were
taken against them and move internally on the network.
The participant stated that attackers had sent emails on the re-
searcher’s behalf to the organization that recognizes the researcher
as a trusted source.
Besides phishing attacks, another participant, P13, mentioned
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) as a difficult and disruptive
type of attack, which is used to impact the availability of a service
by utilizing multiple hijacked machines, thus hindering legitimate
users from using that service [34].
4.1.3 Overloaded and Low-quality Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence (TI) is a collection of information regarding
security threats [31]. Organizations subscribe to open source and
commercial threat intelligence feeds to benefit from such informa-
tion. Besides, they maintain teams that are dedicated to searching
for emerging threats. For SOCs, high-quality TI is paramount in
detecting and preventing incidents.
Eleven participants stated that the threat intelligence that they
collect from both open-source and commercial feeds is high-quality
and useful. However, five participants stated that some feeds pro-
vide very large volumes of information, and they are flooded with
uncorrelated, industry unrelated, and low-quality data. Regarding
the usefulness of their TI, P12 was concerned and said:
A lot of our TI is coming from vendors, and our vendors are not
the best producing TI. There is not a lot of contextual data in
there, which makes them pretty much useless for us. However,
sometimes, they prove to be useful, but not every time.
The interviewer asked P10 if they carefully examine all their threat
intelligence feeds, and the participant said:
We cannot, it is too much. It was 17 terabytes two months
ago, and now it is 20 terabytes. It gets to the point that it is
information overload. We are working toward filtering half of
the TI that we collect.
Almost half of our participants (P1, P5, P6, P11, P12, P13, and P15)
reported having dedicated TI teams.
4.1.4 Poor Quality Reports and Logs
SOC systems continuously generate reports and logs for many
purposes including, but not limited to, informing an analyst of
an incident, monitoring the performance of a particular device,
monitoring the false positive rate of a tool, or auditing the status
of the metric collection. Generating these reports and logs is one
of the major and critical daily activity of a SOC.
Twelve participants stated that they are satisfied with their re-
ports and logs; however, five participants had concerns regarding
their reports.
P12 was concerned about the lack of context in their reports and
said:
Reports generated are ambiguous. It is very difficult to add
meaning to them. We should add more context to our reports.
P9 stated that it is difficult to add meaning to the reports and logs
and sometimes they do not contain enough context, and therefore
are unactionable. The participant said:
There may be a lot of data which is also interesting data but
maybe not entirely what I need, or it may not give any context
to the information which is presented. It takes a lot of time
trying to determine how the data fit the alert’s context in terms
of the infrastructure.
The most commonly mentioned mitigation by our participants
was constant tuning, which is adjusting reports to a better, more
optimal state. Three of the participants (P2, P3, and P4), added that
tuning is more accurate, faster, and more efficient if the organization
develops and uses homegrown tools as this gives them the ability
to customize those tools and reports before deployment in the SOC.
Moreover, if tuning is necessary after these tools are deployed, the
process is faster as the engineers who developed the tools can act
on tuning requests faster, as compared to requesting a vendor to
make changes. Aside from developing homegrown tools, P4 stated
that in their SOC, they have a team dedicated for constant tuning
of their reports and logs.
Although P12 mentioned that reports generated by their SOC
systems are ambiguous and require improvements, P12’s manager
thinks that their reporting and logging mechanisms are in perfect
condition.
P9 is another analyst participant who disagrees with their man-
ager on this matter. Although their manager thinks that their re-
ports are fine, P9 reported that they are sometimes not actionable.
The participant stated that reports do have a lot of interesting infor-
