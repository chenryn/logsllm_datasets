User: I am trying to use the PyDEV console in eclipse for a demonstration of some Python code. For this demonstration I need to resize the default font size used in the PyDev console window.
Some googling led me to change the  'General/Appearance/Colors and Fonts/Debug/Console Font', but that didn't work. I tried changing all candidates I could identify in the Colors and Font settings, but none of them influences the font size in the PyDev console window.
Is there any way to achieve this?
This is in eclipse 4.3.2 (kepler) with Pydev 3.8
