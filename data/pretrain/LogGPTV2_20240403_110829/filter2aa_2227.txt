The Future of Cybertravel: 
Legal Implications  
of the Evasion of Geolocation

What is this talk about? 
  What the law has (or does not have) to say about evasion 
of geolocation or “cybertravel” – about acts by which a 
user makes geolocation tools believe that he is physically 
located somewhere other than where he is located. 
  Example: I sit in the U.S. but use MyExpatNetwork.co.uk to 
acquire a U.K. IP address and appear as though I am 
connected to the internet from the U.K.  
  Is this legal? Does the law care? Will the law care in the 
future?

Why will this talk be of benefit to you? 
  Learn (or update your knowledge) about what the law says 
about geolocation and the evasion of geolocation. 
  Begin thinking about any risks you may consider or subject 
yourself to when you evade geolocation or provide tools to 
evade geolocation (= think about what questions you might 
want to ask your lawyer). 
  Become aware of policy issues that might concern you if you 
care about the future of the internet.

  If the law begins to rely on geolocation, what does it 
mean for the evasion of geolocation? 
  Cybertravel as a misrepresentation of one’s true 
location 
  Cybertravel and the right to obscure one’s location 
Marketa Trimble

5.2  Future law 
  How should evasion be treated in the future? 
  A negligible issue on the margins (de minimis) 
  Equivalent to physical travel, including limited 
constitutional protection for international travel 
  What would be the conditions for implementation?
