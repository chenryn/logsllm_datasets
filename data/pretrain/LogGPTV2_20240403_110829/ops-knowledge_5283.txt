User: In the "Memcache Viewer", is there any way to dump a list of existing keys? Just for debugging, of course, not for use in any scripts!
I ask because it doesn't seem like the GAE SDK is using a "real" memcache server, so I'm guessing it's emulated in Python (for simplicity, as it's just a development server).. This would mean there is a dict somewhere with the keys/values..
Assistant: No. I did not found such functionality in memcached too.
Thinking about this issue, I found this limitation understandable - it would require keeping a registry of keys with all related problems like key expiration, invalidation and of course locking. Such system would not be as fast as memcaches are intended to be.
