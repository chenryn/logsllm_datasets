User:  How to use AWS Lambda service to build an automatic email sending system triggered by timing?
Assistant: 1. Create S3 Bucket - Create a new S3 Bucket in the AWS Console to store email templates and attached files. 2. Prepare the Lambda function - Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Console and name it "auto-email-sender". Choose the runtime and permissions you want to use, and make sure the function has enough disk space and memory to handle your mailing needs. 3. Write the Lambda Handler - Create a new folder inside the Lambda console, and a Python file that contains the code to trigger the email to be sent. The file name should be named "lambda_handler.py". Need to use modules and libraries to complete the function of automatic email sending. 4. Package deployment - Use the following command to package and upload Python files and dependencies to the Lambda function: ``` pip install -t /path/to/lambda/package requests cd /path/to/lambda/package zip -r9 / path/to/lambda/deploy/auto-email-sender.zip . cd /path/to/lambda/handler zip -g /path/to/lambda/deploy/auto-email-sender.zip lambda_handler.py aws lambda update -function-code --function-name auto-email-sender --zip-file fileb://path/to/lambda/deploy/auto-email-sender.zip ``` 5. Create a CloudWatch rule - in the AWS Console Create a CloudWatch event rule in , and select the Lambda function in the trigger action. Enter the CRON expression that needs to fire, then save the rule. 6. Configure the Lambda function - Click the "auto-email-sender" function in the AWS Console to enter the configuration page. In the "Environment Variables" tab, add SMTP and mail settings. 7. Test - Trigger the rule at the time you set and check the Lambda logs to confirm that the mail was sent successfully. 8. Automation - Create automated processes to automatically update Lambda and related dependencies, and perform automated testing and automated deployment. Automated business processes can be achieved through AWS Code Pipeline. 9. Ensure security - Use the object IAM Role to manage access to Lambda functions to avoid potential security risks. Use event notifications to monitor the running status of Lambda to ensure the reliability and stability of operations.
