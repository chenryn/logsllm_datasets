business and then of course knew what we do in
our free time, what our names are. . . Since then, I
pay extremely close attention which tag is on the
pictures.” (P24)
While some negative experiences with clients may pose
physical safety risks, other participants described clients
threatening their boundaries by draining workers’ time and re-
sources: “time-wasters” just looking to chat or ask for photos
without intending to book a session.
Legal risks. The extent to which sex work is legalized, and
how it is regulated, inﬂuences how safe many sex workers feel

while working. Our interview participants worked primarily
in Germany and Switzerland, where sex work is legal, but
several had also worked abroad in countries with different
legal frameworks. Their experiences both in Germany and
Switzerland, as well as abroad, highlight that the different
ways legality is deﬁned impacts their safety. Several partic-
ipants noted that when countries follow the Nordic model,
in which selling sex is not illegal but buying sexual services
is [59], they feel less safe. Our survey supported this: two-
thirds of respondents reported that whether they were legally
permitted to work as a sex worker affected how safe they felt.
One participant explained that this was because clients are
more afraid and less willing to share their real information
with sex workers when the client is buying illegal services;
sex workers rely on this information to vet new clients, or
to check that an unknown client does not have a bad reputa-
tion among other sex workers [7, 67]. P10 described related
challenges from working in France:
“If guys want to see escorts they [must] pay like
1,000 Euros if they are [caught]. So that makes the
job more difﬁcult because you have to stay in this
in secret. . . . If you have a problem you can’t [call]
the police.” (P10)
Even when working in a country where sex work is legal,
a worker’s immigration status may prevent them from legally
registering as a sex worker. Of those we surveyed, 20% re-
ported that they felt “insecure” or “very insecure” because
of their immigration status. In particular, our participants de-
scribed how the inability to work legally due to immigration
status or the country’s legal framework results in a lack of ac-
cess to law enforcement, trustworthy clients, healthcare, and
other safety nets, leading to risks to physical safety, respect,
and ﬁnancial security.
Even among those who are eligible to work legally, discom-
fort with the way legalized sex work is regulated can create
safety issues. For example, as of 2017, German sex workers
are required to register in order to work [10]. Some partic-
ipants worried about how the government might use such
data about them. Two participants shared that the registration
requirements reminded them of the Nazi era:
“The registration and the new law, that concerns
me. . . . I don’t want to give them all my data. . . I
feel like I’m in the 30’s. Of course I have concerns
about that. . . [will] the moment ever come where
there are like, online raids and people try to track
our proﬁles?” (P12)
P26 had similar thoughts, and said, “maybe the [registra-
tion] data isn’t being mishandled today, but in the future it
could be.” This highlights the tension between legality and
privacy; in order to be compliant, sex workers in Germany
must sacriﬁce personal information that they may feel puts
them at risk.
According to P16, the registration requirement also creates
divisions between sex workers and makes it more difﬁcult for
sex workers to organize together, as their goals and needs are
different. This creates barriers to building community, which
in turn creates a barrier to staying safe:
“There is absolutely no worker solidarity between
the German workers and the non-German workers.
They’re happy for all of us [non-German workers]
to basically die in the gutter, and it’s very frustrating.
I blame the way that the laws are set up in Germany,
because it puts sex workers into two camps, those
who are legal and compliant with German law, and
those who. . . still need to work, but they can’t get
licenses.” (P16)
Several of our participants also expressed anger at the ways
FOSTA-SESTA impacted their work even in Europe. FOSTA-
SESTA is a 2018 law passed by the United States Congress,
which was purportedly designed to remove protection from
liability for websites that facilitate sex trafﬁcking. The effect
was that many sites that sex workers had used to advertise,
screen, and build community, including Backpage.com, were
taken down or categorically excluded sex work from their
platform [3, 12]:
“Backpage was really great and SESTA/FOSTA re-
ally sucks. . . especially here in Germany where my
job is totally legal and I pay taxes. Pretty frustrated.
[It used to be] about 30% of income and I still didn’t
recover from it. Backpage was very easy to use for
clients.” (P13)
P2 worried that FOSTA-SESTA and similar laws would
soon block them from all platforms they use to do sex work:
“When I see stuff like FOSTA, it’s also a question
of time and when Europe will become similar. And
then there’ll probably be nothing left for us except
to manage everything by hand.” (P2)
Non-sex-work-speciﬁc laws also impact the safety of sex
workers. For example, Germany has an imprint requirement
for websites (“Impressumspﬂicht”), requiring websites to list
the website operator’s legal name, address, and contact infor-
mation [17]. Many participants mentioned that this require-
ment threatens their privacy and potentially their physical
safety because they must either list their real contact informa-
tion on a site on which they otherwise use a pseudonym, or
risk being in violation of the law.
Risks from digital sex-work platforms. Even digital sex-
work platforms pose safety risks to sex workers. Several par-
ticipants reported having their intellectual property — photos
of them or composed advertisements they had created —
stolen and republished on other sex-work advertising websites
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    381
that they had never used before. The business strategy of these
websites is to steal workers’ ads with legitimate photos and
contact information in order to draw in customers, hoping
that when the sex worker whose content has been stolen be-
gins receiving calls from clients who found them on the new
site, they choose to begin using the website in earnest. Some-
times, these new websites use workers’ photos to advertise
services the sex worker does not actually offer, creating risks
to their physical safety if a client contacts them expecting
those services. The participants to whom this happened de-
scribed having their content stolen as an upsetting violation
of their boundaries and privacy. Potential recourse, which
might involve commissioning a lawyer to send a take-down
notice, was described as “too laborious” (P14) or unlikely to
be successful:
“I haven’t been able to get mine down. . . . I know a
lot of people have [tried very hard], and they don’t
take them down. And that’s the thing with being
criminalized, it’s like where do we even turn? No
one cares about people stealing your stuff.” (P18)
Risks from other digital platforms. Sex workers also ex-
perience harm on non-sex-work digital platforms due to plat-
form rules and community standards. American-based digi-
tal payment platforms, like Paypal, are especially challeng-
ing for sex workers. Paypal offers a popular and simple way
to transfer money, but is not a reliable tool for sex workers.
Many of our participants reported having accounts frozen or
deleted, sometimes blocking access to their funds. This is
likely done under Paypal’s “Acceptable Use Policy,” which
prohibits “transactions involving. . . certain sexually oriented
materials or services” [58].
The lack of reliable, common payment platforms, and the
risk that popular payment platforms like Paypal will freeze or
disable their accounts, sometimes left our participants with
difﬁcult choices for processing payments and made ﬁnancial
security more difﬁcult. While many still use cash primarily,
cash posed challenges for large payments and for digital sex
work. We discuss participants’ strategies for working around
these limitations in Section 4.3.
Even when workers do not use digital platforms for sex
work, they may experience harms due to their identity as a sex
worker. Many participants talked about how they could not
use American social media platforms to discuss, let alone ad-
vertise, their legal sex work services because these platforms
had rules against sexually-explicit content. One participant
shared their experience of being banned from a social media
platform without warning or notice:
“I had I don’t know how many followers on Insta-
gram and at some point. . . it was just deleted. . . that
deﬁnitely hurt my business . . . since a lot of clients
say, yeah, where can I ﬁnd pictures of you or some-
thing and then I would just send a link to my Insta-
gram account and that was convenient.” (P4)
As P20 put it, “Google is now a market driver and one has
to submit to their ‘norms.’. . . Or Facebook.” In many cases,
there is no recourse to being banned [5, 7].
Similarly, two participants talked about being banned from
AirBnB, despite never using the platform for sex work — as
far as they can tell, their identity as a sex worker alone was
enough to get them permanently banned from the platform:5
“AirBnB bans workers just for being [sex workers].
They have not shown their face, don’t use same
email or phone. . . and they don’t [do sex] work from
[an] AirBnB and they got banned.” (P13)
While digital platforms such as PayPal, Facebook, and
AirBnB are based in the U.S., they operate at a global scale.
The imposition of American-driven community standards on
sex workers working legally has signiﬁcant repercussions for
nearly every aspects of workers’ safety we identiﬁed above:
physical, ﬁnancial, privacy, and the ability to set boundaries
and create and maintain community.
Digitally-mediated interpersonal risks. Digital platforms
can also enable or facilitate risks to sex workers from other
platform users. Several participants described challenges with
platforms that require them to share their legal name. P3
explained how this made Paypal dangerous by exposing their
legal name to clients when they pay:
“Being able to use Paypal would be awesome. . . [it
doesn’t work because] we’re all criminals. And
I work under an alias. Paypal doesn’t allow that.
Paypal and also Amazon are U.S.-led companies.
You’ll be kicked out if you do sex work” (P3)
These “real name” policies have long been documented
as dangerous or damaging, for example for trans people who
have not had a legal name change [16,29]. For our participants,
many of whom use an alias when they work for safety pur-
poses, such policies risk exposing their legal name to clients,
and thus threaten participants’ boundaries, their privacy, and
potentially their physical safety by increasing the risk of stalk-
ing or blackmail.
Instances of digitally-mediated context collapse, in which
a platform forces the intersection of previously distinct au-
diences [44], had similar consequences on our participants’
goals. Multiple participants discussed having clients contact
them through a social media or dating site that they did not
use for sex work, or friends and family ﬁnding their sex work
accounts. Sometimes this is a direct result of platform design
5AirBnB ﬁled patents for technology that allows them to identify sex
workers and those that are mentally ill in 2018 [18], but reports surfaced
regarding AirBnB discriminating against sex workers as early as 2016 [57].

rather than deliberate snooping. For example, Facebook’s Peo-
ple You May Know (PYMK) algorithm is known [32, 71] to
cause this issue:
“I wanted a second account with Facebook [for
clients to interact with me]. I had a different email
address. . . I didn’t want my friends to see it at all,
but they were suggested to me [by Facebook] im-
mediately. . . [so] I just deleted it right away.” (P29)
Regardless of the mechanism through which a sex worker
is found, the experience is violating and threatens workers’
established boundaries:
“Somebody found my [private] Tinder proﬁle. . . . I
did simply explain to him that I found that a bit
stalking-like what he was doing. And that I didn’t
appreciate such personal contact. He carried it so far
to search and ﬁnd my private Facebook proﬁle, then
I blocked him. I don’t want to have personal contact
with my clients on my Facebook proﬁle.. . . That
also destroys my image as dominatrix.” (P21)
While some described strategies for avoiding these privacy
violating experiences (see Section 4.3), others shared this sen-
timent with P23: “there are things that are just unavoidable.”
4.3 Safety Strategies
Many participants took steps to meet their safety goals and
avoid potential threats to those goals. Rather than being tech-
nically complex, participants mainly relied on manual pro-
tective strategies, such as vetting clients, self-censorship, and
keeping two separate devices. While technology made some
of these strategies more effective, few participants relied on
security tools to be safe online. Often this was due to secu-
rity tools and features being a burden, disrupting other safety
strategies, or being difﬁcult for clients to use, leading to a lack
of adoption or abandonment.
Covering. A common strategy our participants used to pro-
tect their physical safety is to “cover,” or tell a friend or col-
league the details of an appointment beforehand, so that they
can contact the police or another emergency contact if the
person does not check in at a pre-planned time. This strategy
was used by 68% of our survey respondents. P2 described
their strategy, and how the Internet helps them feel safer:
“Someone almost always knows where I am. I’ll put
out some updates in regular intervals, call someone
or do a video chat or something. . . . My safety sys-
tem without the Internet would. . . not completely
fall apart, but. . . it wouldn’t be as comfortable. And
also not as comprehensive.” (P2)
However, the effectiveness of covering depends on having
a reliable contact to provide cover, and on being diligent about
checking in while at the appointment. P5 shared a story about
forgetting to check in with their contact:
“In the heat of the moment I forgot to check the
time and then someone knocked on the door and
there were two men and the hotel manager at the
door and it was then, of course, super embarrassing.”
(P5)
Several participants described wishing that there were bet-
ter mechanisms for doing this without needing to depend on
other people, which can be cumbersome and unreliable. P27
envisioned an app or other digitally-mediated platform that
could possibly ﬁll this role:
“Especially for women. . . [who] don’t speak the
language. . . . they would enter where they are and
for how long and they could push a button to say
that they’re there. And then after the time runs out
again, that they’re out again. Of course, with a gen-
erated password each time. When that doesn’t hap-
pen. . . the person that you entered as an emergency
contact gets contacted by the app. If you don’t have
anyone, then it’s the administrator that alerts the
necessary authorities.” (P27)
P27 also suggested that if this type of covering tool existed,
it would also work as a deterrent for aggressive clients, and
that “probably it would be enough, if johns knew that there
was something like that.”
Vetting clients. Some interview participants talked about
vetting clients prior to meeting them in person, and 51% of
survey respondents said they gather information about clients
before meeting them.
Vetting can take two forms. In the ﬁrst form, sex workers
