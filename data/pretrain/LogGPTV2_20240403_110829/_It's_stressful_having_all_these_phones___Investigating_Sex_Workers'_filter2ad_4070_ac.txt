### Business and Personal Boundaries

Since then, I have paid extremely close attention to the tags on the pictures. (P24)

While some negative experiences with clients may pose physical safety risks, other participants described clients who drain their time and resources, often referred to as "time-wasters." These individuals engage in lengthy conversations or request photos without intending to book a session.

### Legal Risks

The extent to which sex work is legalized and regulated significantly influences the safety of sex workers. Our interview participants primarily worked in Germany and Switzerland, where sex work is legal. However, several had also worked in countries with different legal frameworks. Their experiences highlight that the way legality is defined impacts their safety. For instance, under the Nordic model, where selling sex is legal but buying sexual services is not, many participants felt less safe. This was supported by our survey, where two-thirds of respondents reported that their legal status as sex workers affected their sense of safety.

One participant explained that when clients are purchasing illegal services, they are more hesitant to share their real information, which sex workers rely on to vet new clients and check for any negative reputations. P10 described the challenges of working in France:

"If guys want to see escorts, they must pay like 1,000 Euros if they are caught. So, that makes the job more difficult because you have to stay in secret. If you have a problem, you can’t call the police." (P10)

Even in countries where sex work is legal, immigration status can prevent workers from legally registering. Of those surveyed, 20% reported feeling "insecure" or "very insecure" due to their immigration status. This results in a lack of access to law enforcement, trustworthy clients, healthcare, and other safety nets, leading to risks to physical safety, respect, and financial security.

For those eligible to work legally, discomfort with the regulatory framework can create safety issues. For example, since 2017, German sex workers are required to register. Some participants expressed concerns about how the government might use this data. P12 shared:

"The registration and the new law concern me. I don’t want to give them all my data. I feel like I’m in the 30’s. Of course, I have concerns... will the moment ever come where there are online raids, and people try to track our profiles?" (P12)

P26 echoed similar thoughts, suggesting that while the data may not be misused today, it could be in the future. This highlights the tension between legality and privacy. P16 noted that the registration requirement also creates divisions among sex workers, making it harder to build community and stay safe:

"There is absolutely no worker solidarity between the German workers and the non-German workers. They’re happy for all of us [non-German workers] to die in the gutter, and it’s very frustrating. I blame the way the laws are set up in Germany, putting sex workers into two camps: those who are legal and compliant, and those who still need to work but can’t get licenses." (P16)

### Impact of FOSTA-SESTA

Several participants expressed frustration with the impact of FOSTA-SESTA, a 2018 U.S. law designed to remove liability protection for websites facilitating sex trafficking. The effect was the shutdown of many platforms used by sex workers for advertising, screening, and community building, such as Backpage.com. P13 commented:

"Backpage was really great, and SESTA/FOSTA really sucks. Especially here in Germany, where my job is totally legal and I pay taxes. It used to be about 30% of my income, and I still haven’t recovered. Backpage was very easy for clients to use." (P13)

P2 worried that similar laws would soon block all platforms they use:

"When I see stuff like FOSTA, it’s also a question of time before Europe becomes similar. And then there’ll probably be nothing left for us except to manage everything by hand." (P2)

### Non-Sex-Work-Specific Laws

Non-sex-work-specific laws also impact the safety of sex workers. For example, Germany's "Impressumspflicht" requires websites to list the operator's legal name, address, and contact information. Many participants mentioned that this threatens their privacy and potentially their physical safety, as they must either list their real contact information or risk violating the law.

### Digital Platform Risks

Digital platforms, including those specifically for sex work, pose safety risks. Several participants reported having their intellectual property—photos and advertisements—stolen and republished on other websites. These sites steal content to attract customers, hoping the sex worker will start using the platform. Sometimes, these sites advertise services the worker does not offer, creating physical safety risks. Participants described this as an upsetting violation of their boundaries and privacy. Potential recourse, such as sending a takedown notice, was described as "too laborious" (P14) or unlikely to be successful:

"I haven’t been able to get mine down. I know a lot of people have tried very hard, and they don’t take them down. And that’s the thing with being criminalized; it’s like, where do we even turn? No one cares about people stealing your stuff." (P18)

### Risks from Other Digital Platforms

Sex workers also experience harm on non-sex-work digital platforms due to platform rules and community standards. American-based digital payment platforms, like PayPal, are particularly challenging. Many participants reported having accounts frozen or deleted, sometimes blocking access to their funds. This is likely due to PayPal's "Acceptable Use Policy," which prohibits transactions involving certain sexually oriented materials or services.

The lack of reliable, common payment platforms, and the risk of popular platforms freezing or disabling accounts, leaves participants with difficult choices for processing payments and maintaining financial security. While many still use cash, it poses challenges for large payments and digital sex work.

Participants also discussed being banned from social media platforms for discussing or advertising their legal sex work. One participant shared:

"I had I don’t know how many followers on Instagram, and at some point, it was just deleted. That definitely hurt my business, as many clients asked for pictures, and I would send a link to my Instagram account, which was convenient." (P4)

Similarly, two participants were banned from Airbnb, seemingly for being sex workers, despite not using the platform for sex work:

"Airbnb bans workers just for being [sex workers]. They have not shown their face, don’t use the same email or phone, and they don’t do sex work from an Airbnb, yet they got banned." (P13)

These U.S.-based platforms, operating globally, impose American-driven community standards on sex workers, significantly impacting their physical, financial, and privacy safety.

### Digitally-Mediated Interpersonal Risks

Digital platforms can also enable or facilitate risks from other users. Several participants described challenges with platforms requiring them to share their legal names. P3 explained:

"Being able to use PayPal would be awesome, but we’re all criminals. I work under an alias, and PayPal doesn’t allow that. PayPal and Amazon are U.S.-led companies, and you’ll be kicked out if you do sex work." (P3)

Such policies risk exposing legal names to clients, threatening boundaries, privacy, and physical safety. Context collapse, where distinct audiences intersect, also has consequences. Multiple participants discussed clients contacting them through social media or dating sites, or friends and family finding their sex work accounts. Facebook’s People You May Know (PYMK) algorithm is known to cause this issue:

"I wanted a second account with Facebook for clients. I had a different email address and didn’t want my friends to see it, but they were suggested to me immediately, so I deleted it right away." (P29)

Regardless of the mechanism, the experience is violating and threatens established boundaries:

"Somebody found my private Tinder profile. I explained that I found it stalking-like and didn’t appreciate personal contact. He searched and found my private Facebook profile, so I blocked him. I don’t want personal contact with clients on my Facebook profile, as it destroys my image as a dominatrix." (P21)

### Safety Strategies

Many participants took steps to meet their safety goals and avoid potential threats. These strategies include manual protective measures like vetting clients, self-censorship, and keeping separate devices. While technology can enhance these strategies, few participants relied on security tools, often due to their complexity, disruption, or difficulty for clients.

#### Covering

A common strategy is to "cover," or inform a friend or colleague of appointment details beforehand, so they can contact emergency services if the person does not check in at a pre-planned time. P2 described their strategy:

"Someone almost always knows where I am. I’ll put out updates, call someone, or do a video chat. My safety system without the Internet would not completely fall apart, but it wouldn’t be as comfortable or comprehensive." (P2)

However, the effectiveness of covering depends on having a reliable contact and being diligent about checking in. P5 shared a story about forgetting to check in:

"In the heat of the moment, I forgot to check the time. Someone knocked on the door, and there were two men and the hotel manager. It was super embarrassing." (P5)

Several participants wished for better mechanisms to cover without relying on others. P27 envisioned an app:

"Especially for women who don’t speak the language, they could enter where they are and for how long, and push a button to say they’re there. After the time runs out, they confirm they’re out. With a generated password each time, if that doesn’t happen, the emergency contact gets alerted. If you don’t have anyone, the administrator alerts the necessary authorities." (P27)

P27 also suggested that such a tool would deter aggressive clients, as "probably it would be enough if johns knew there was something like that."

#### Vetting Clients

Some participants talked about vetting clients before meeting them in person. Vetting can involve gathering information about clients to ensure they are safe and reliable.
