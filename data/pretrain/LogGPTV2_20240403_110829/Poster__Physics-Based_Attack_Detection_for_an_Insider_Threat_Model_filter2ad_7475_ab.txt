value is being spoofed to stay undetected.
This experiment considers possibly the most obvious of this sort
of interconnection and dependency between stages, in the sense
that the water out-flow from the tank should be equal to the water
in-flow to the subsequent tank.
The theoretical motivation behind this experiment is, if the model
is carefully designed, by taking care of laws of physics and by
considering the system dynamics, then we can design a real-time
dynamic detector which could detect the fault and can also raise an
alarm in case of an anomaly. In a water tank, we know that the rate
of change of water inside the tank is equal to the difference between
water flowing in to the tank and water flowing out from the tank
with respect to time. We can represent this using a mass-balance
equation such as,
= Qin − Qout
A
dh
dt
since V = A × h,
(1)
where V represents the volume of the tank, A is the cross-sectional
area of the tank, and h is the height of the water inside the tank,
Eq. 1 provides a linear equation, we can see the term [Qin − Qout]
represents the water flow which depends upon the PLC control
actions. Let us consider that the state of the system is the height of
water inside a tank. Then the solution of this equation gives us the
following result.
xk +1 = Axk + Buk ,

Where xk ∈ Rn and uk ∈ Rm is the system’s state and PLC control
action at any time instance k with A and B as state space matrices
of appropriate dimensions. Similarly we can describe the sensor
state and we can get the set of system equations. From the sensor
state we can extract the proposed feature set (rate of change) as
follows,
Fs = xk +1 − xk
(k + 1) − (k) ,
We collected data for normal operation of the process and then
under an insider attacker with physical access to the plant. We
created chunks of readings from that data and extracted the feature
for each chunk. A machine learning (SVM) model is trained on the
labeled data set to find the anomalies.
In Table 1, we can see the detection accuracy using the SVM. Re-
ducing chunk size to 5 could not capture enough variation from the
data while increasing chunk size beyond 30 reduces the number
of feature sets available for training and testing as the data set is
limited. The best accuracy we achieve is for a chunk size of 10,
which is 96.87%.

majority of the insider threat works are related to cyber domain,
some research efforts regarding attacker models in CPS domain
have been made in [13, 14]. In [14], Teixeria et al. defined an attack
space based on adversary’s knowledge and resources. Using this
framework, bias injection, replay and zero dynamics attacks are
analyzed. Work in [13], extends Dolev-Yao model for CPS domain.
The proposed model is necessary as conventional Dolev-Yao at-
tacker does not include physical space and hence the attacks which
can be mounted from physical components of a CPS. Due to space
limitations a summary of different attack scenario mentioned in
Table 2, helps in understanding the motivation of an attacker and
also the attack type. Physics based attack detection is also studied
in literature [6, 8, 10, 12, 15]. All of these have limitations explained
therein and takes a control theoretic approach while we explored
novel features and deploy machine learning algorithm.
4 CONCLUSIONS
A novel method for detecting physical attacks in a setting of an
insider threat model is proposed. Attack detection scheme based
on the Physics of the process is able to detect anomalies with an
accuracy of 96%. We conclude that the proposed Physics based
method is effective against an attacker trying to achieve certain
goals as stated in attacker model. To improve the analysis further,
we are extending the proposed scheme for scalability (considering
attributes like water flow sensor, chemical dosing and pressure
sensors), for a case of complex CPS, where we are trying to get
precise system models to apply our attack detection scheme.
