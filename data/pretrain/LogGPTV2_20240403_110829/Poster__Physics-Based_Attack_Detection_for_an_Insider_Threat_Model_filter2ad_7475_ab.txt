### Figure 2: Attack Scenario 2, Region B
In this scenario, the level sensor LIT301 is under physical attack, and simultaneously, the sensor value is being spoofed to remain undetected.

### Experiment Overview
This experiment examines the interconnection and dependency between stages in a water tank system. Specifically, it considers that the outflow from one tank should equal the inflow to the subsequent tank. The theoretical basis for this experiment is that if the model is carefully designed, taking into account the laws of physics and system dynamics, it can detect faults and raise alarms in real-time.

### Mass-Balance Equation
In a water tank, the rate of change of water volume inside the tank is given by the difference between the inflow and outflow rates. This can be represented by the mass-balance equation:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}
\]
where \( V \) is the volume of the tank, \( A \) is the cross-sectional area, and \( h \) is the height of the water inside the tank. Since \( V = A \times h \), the equation becomes:
\[
A \frac{dh}{dt} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}
\]
(1)

### System Dynamics
The term \( [Q_{in} - Q_{out}] \) represents the water flow, which depends on the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) control actions. If we consider the state of the system as the height of the water inside the tank, the system dynamics can be described by:
\[
x_{k+1} = Ax_k + Bu_k
\]
where \( x_k \in \mathbb{R}^n \) and \( u_k \in \mathbb{R}^m \) are the system's state and PLC control action at time instance \( k \), and \( A \) and \( B \) are state space matrices of appropriate dimensions.

### Feature Extraction
From the sensor state, we can extract the feature set (rate of change) as follows:
\[
F_s = \frac{x_{k+1} - x_k}{(k+1) - k}
\]

### Data Collection and Analysis
We collected data for normal operation and under an insider attacker with physical access to the plant. We created chunks of readings from this data and extracted features for each chunk. A machine learning (SVM) model was trained on the labeled dataset to identify anomalies.

### Detection Accuracy
Table 1 shows the detection accuracy using the SVM for different chunk sizes. Reducing the chunk size to 5 did not capture enough variation, while increasing it beyond 30 reduced the number of feature sets available for training and testing due to the limited dataset. The best accuracy was achieved with a chunk size of 10, at 96.87%.

| Chunk Size | Accuracy |
|------------|----------|
| 30         | 60%      |
| 50         | 70%      |
| 60         | 86.6%    |
| 20         | 95%      |
| 15         | 96.87%   |
| 10         | 89.06%   |
| 5          | -        |

### Related Work
This section discusses prior research related to attacker models in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Most insider threat works are related to the cyber domain, but some efforts have been made in the CPS domain. For example, Teixeira et al. [14] defined an attack space based on the adversary's knowledge and resources, analyzing bias injection, replay, and zero dynamics attacks. The work in [13] extends the Dolev-Yao model for CPS, addressing the limitations of the conventional model in handling physical components.

### Insider Attack Categories
Table 2 summarizes different insider attack scenarios, their motivations, and types.

### Conclusions
We propose a novel method for detecting physical attacks in an insider threat model. The detection scheme, based on the physics of the process, achieves an accuracy of 96%. Future work will extend the proposed scheme for scalability, considering attributes like water flow sensors, chemical dosing, and pressure sensors, to apply the attack detection scheme to more complex CPS.
