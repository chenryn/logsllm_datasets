User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题how to prevent cron logs from registering in syslog? I have separated my crontab logging into /var/log/cron.log by uncommenting the below line in /etc/syslog.conf, but it still writes to /var/log/syslog too!

cron.*                                  /var/log/cron.log


How can i prevent it from writing to /var/log/syslog?

Assistant: You need to find the line that defines what should be sent to /var/log/syslog and modify it so that cron messages are not included. For example on an Ubuntu system I have to hand the /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf file has the following entry for syslog:

*.*;auth,authpriv.none             -/var/log/syslog


changing it to:

*.*;cron,auth,authpriv.none             -/var/log/syslog


Does what you want. Note that the above is taking advantage of the ability to specify multiple facilities with the same priority as a list, if you don't already have a .none priority you would have to do this for example:

*.*;auth,authpriv.info;cron.none             -/var/log/syslog
