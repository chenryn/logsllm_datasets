### Title: Blackhat EU-21 - TeamTNT: Explosive Cryptomining Threats

Since the introduction of Amazon Web Services (AWS), there has been a steady migration from on-premise to cloud deployments. Misconfigured cloud services often present easy targets for attackers. Palo Alto Networks reported that, during the Spring of 2021, Docker services were attacked approximately every 90 minutes. Of these attacks, around 76% were attributed to cryptojacking threat actors, with one of the most active being TeamTNT.

TeamTNT is a prominent cryptojacking group that primarily targets Linux servers. This session will delve into the threat actor's activities and their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) across various campaigns. The first public report on TeamTNT, published by Trend Micro in May 2020, detailed attacks on servers running exposed Docker instances. However, our research indicates that TeamTNT has been active since the Fall of 2019, six months before the initial report.

While TeamTNT is best known for compromising Kubernetes clusters and servers running Docker, this session will also highlight their campaigns against servers running Redis and Windows. Additionally, the threat actor maintains a public persona on Twitter. We will explore their social media activity and how they uniquely interact with the security research community.

The session, along with the accompanying whitepaper, will provide defenders with comprehensive information to better protect and detect attacks by this threat actor. The full toolset used by TeamTNT, including scripts, DDoS malware, backdoors, and rootkits, will be presented.
