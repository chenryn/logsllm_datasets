**Current Behavior**
When using the `formArrayName` directive, it prevents `@ContentChildren()` from detecting the children of the element where `formArrayName` is applied.

**Expected Behavior**
`@ContentChildren()` should be able to correctly identify and reach the children of an element that has the `formArrayName` directive applied to it.

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions**
A Plunker demonstrating the issue can be found [here](<link-to-plunker>). In this example, `<your-component>` is defined twice in the template, but the length of the array returned by `@ContentChildren()` is 1, indicating that not all children are being detected.

**Environment Information:**
- **Angular Version:** 2.4.7
