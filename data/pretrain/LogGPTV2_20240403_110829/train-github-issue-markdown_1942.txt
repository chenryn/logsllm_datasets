**Current behavior**  
Usage of the `formArrayName` directive stops `@ContentChildren()` from finding
children of the element onto which `formArrayName` was applied.
**Expected behavior**  
`@ContentChildren()` reaches children of `formArrayName`.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
This plunker shows the problem. `` is defined twice in the
template, but the length of the found components is 1.
**Please tell us about your environment:**
  * **Angular version:** 2.4.7
