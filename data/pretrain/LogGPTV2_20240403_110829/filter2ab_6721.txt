**ATT&CK ID:** G0010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Turla

**Description:**
Turla, a well-known threat actor, has been observed compromising internal network systems to use them as proxies for forwarding traffic to command and control (C2) servers. [25]

This technique allows Turla to obfuscate their activities and make it more difficult for defenders to trace the malicious traffic back to its origin.
