## Expected Behavior
GTM tags should work the same way on every page, whether the user arrived at
this page or browsed to it.
## Current Behavior
GTM tags that use the `event` type stop working properly as soon as a user
browse the website. By "browse", I mean using client-side navigation, which
doesn't refresh the page but only part of it (kinda the point of SPA)
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
You can reproduce on my online staging environment:
  * Install Chrome plugin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna to be able to see the GTM events calls in the browser console
  * Go to https://staging.hep.loan-advisor.studylink.fr/idrac
  * Click on the top-left IDRAC logo, you should see logs on the console (event fired)
  * Go to https://staging.hep.loan-advisor.studylink.fr and select the "Idrac" choice from the select input, then click "Go", you should see logs in the console again (redirection detected, which creates a pageview)
  * Click on the top-left IDRAC logo, you won't see any log this time
## Context
I believe that somehow GTM binds some DOM events upon loading that get cleaned
when the DOM changes due to Next.js redirection, which reloads the DOM,
partially.
Those GTM tags (type: event) I'm talking about are basically triggers based on
HTML class/id in the DOM. When I use the GTM Preview mode (debug), I can see
that there is no gtm.linkClick fired when clicking the logo, if I got
redirected from another page using a frontend-redirection. But if I refresh
the page and click, it works just fine.

The simplest workaround I see is to disable client-side redirection but
forcing a page refresh, but that's not a nice workaround and kills the point
of building an SPA in the first place.
Maybe there is a way to force refresh the GTM script (need to clean it from
the DOM and add it again because it won't trigger if already loaded), or to
use a feature within GTM that binds everything again? I don't know.
