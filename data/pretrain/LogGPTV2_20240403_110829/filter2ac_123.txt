**ATT&CK ID:** T1563.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** RDP Hijacking

Adversaries may exploit legitimate remote desktop sessions to move laterally within a network environment. Remote desktop functionality is a standard feature in many operating systems, enabling users to access and interact with the graphical user interface (GUI) of a remote system as if they were physically present. Microsoft's implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is known as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).

By hijacking an active RDP session, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the remote system and potentially escalate their privileges, making it easier to navigate through the network undetected. This technique leverages the trust established by the legitimate user's session, thereby evading some security controls that might otherwise detect or prevent such activity.
