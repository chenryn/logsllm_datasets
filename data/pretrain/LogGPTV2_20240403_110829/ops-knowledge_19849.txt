Question: When designing the interface between an isolated library sandbox and the main application, such as a web browser, which of the following considerations are crucial to prevent security breaches?
"A": "Ensuring that pointers in one memory are meaningful in another memory without explicit memory copying.",
"B": "Validating data coming from the library to prevent compromised libraries from returning unexpected error codes or flags.",
"C": "Allowing libraries to call any function in the application as long as it is part of the original API design.",
"D": "Restricting arguments to callback functions to prevent compromised libraries from passing arbitrary pointers."
