ABSTRACT
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming increasingly critical
for the well-being of society (e.g., electricity generation and distri-
bution, water treatment, implantable medical devices etc.). While
the convergence of computing, communications and physical con-
trol in such systems provides benefits in terms of efficiency and
convenience, the attack surface resulting from this convergence
poses unique security and privacy challenges. These systems repre-
sent the new frontier for cyber risk. CPS-SPC is an annual forum
in its 4th edition this year, that aims to provide a focal point for
the research community to begin addressing the security and pri-
vacy challenges of CPS in a comprehensive and multidisciplinary
manner and, in tandem with other efforts, build a comprehensive
research road map.

1 INTRODUCTION
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computing and communi-
cation capabilities with monitoring and control of entities in the
physical world. These systems are usually composed of a set of
networked agents, including sensors, actuators, control processing
units, and communication devices. While some forms of CPS are al-
ready in use, the widespread growth of wireless embedded sensors
and actuators is creating several new applications in areas such as
medical devices, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure,
and is increasing the role that the information infrastructure plays
in existing control systems such as in the process control industry
or the power grid.
Many CPS applications are safety-critical: their failure can cause
irreparable harm to the physical system under control, and to the
people who depend, use or operate it. In particular, critical cyber-
physical infrastructures such as electric power generation, trans-
mission and distribution grids, oil and natural gas systems, water
and waste-water treatment plants, and transportation networks

play a fundamental and large-scale role in our society. Their dis-
ruption can have a significant impact on individuals, and nations
at large. Securing these CPS infrastructures is, therefore, vitally
important.
The challenges in securing CPS are many. But fundamentally,
it is important to recognize that securing CPS differs from the tra-
ditional cyber security concerns of confidentiality, integrity and
availability (CIA) that have dominated the security of informa-
tion technology (IT) systems. At its core, CPS security must be
approached and framed from the perspective of how attacks on
CIA properties perturb control-theoretic properties such as con-
trollability, observability and stability and consequently system
safety. Like past editions, CPS-SPC 2018 aims to bring together a
community around security and privacy challenges in CPS. It is
held in conjunction with ACM Computer and Communications
Security (CCS) conference, a flagship annual conference of ACM
SIGSAC (Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control) and
a premier security conference. The co-location of these two events
brings advantages to both, as well as to the community itself.
2 SCOPE
CPS-SPC 2018 encourages participation from researchers and prac-
titioners from diverse CPS domains and multiple disciplinary back-
grounds representative of CPS, including but not limited to infor-
mation security, control theory, embedded systems, and human
factors. It provides a forum for researchers from these various CPS
domains and backgrounds to share their ideas and results, to dis-
cuss emerging technologies and trends that impact CPS, to study
differences and commonalities across different CPS domains, and to
build a multidisciplinary body of knowledge in this sub-field that
is still developing principles, models, and theories for security and
privacy in CPS.
This year’s workshop builds on the foundations laid by the last
three editions and invited submissions at the interface of control
theory, information security, embedded and real-time systems, and
human factors among others as applied to CPS. Specifically the
topics of interest included but were not limited to:
• mathematical foundations for secure CPS
• control theoretic approaches to secure CPS
• high assurance security architectures for CPS
• security and resilience metrics for CPS
• metrics and risk assessment approaches for CPS
• privacy in CPS
• network security for CPS
• game theory applied to CPS security
• security of embedded systems, IoT and real-time systems in
the context of CPS

• human factors and humans in the loop
• understanding dependencies among security, reliability and
• economics of security and privacy in CPS
• intrusion detection in CPS
• model-based security systems engineering
• experimental insights from real-world CPS or CPS testbeds
CPS domains of interest include but are not limited to:
• health care and medical devices
• manufacturing
• industrial control systems
• SCADA systems
• Robotics
• smart building environments
• unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
• autonomous vehicles
• transportation systems and networks
Also of interest were papers that can point the research com-
munity to new research directions, and those that can set research
agendas and priorities in CPS security and privacy.
3 PROGRAM
CPS-SPC 2018 is a one day workshop held on October 19th 2018. The
program comprises three technical sessions with talks on accepted
short and regular length research papers. This year the workshop
received 22 papers with authors from 15 different countries and
accepted 8 full and 2 short papers for presentation at the workshop.
