## Abstract
Recently, Lee et al. claimed that the blind signature schemes proposed by Camenisch et al. do not satisfy the untraceability property. In this paper, we analyze and demonstrate that the traceability attack proposed by Lee et al. is flawed.

## Introduction
A blind signature scheme is a cryptographic protocol that allows a requester to obtain a signature without revealing the message, while ensuring that the signer cannot later trace any message-signature pair. Such a scheme achieves unforgeability for the signer and untraceability for the requester. Camenisch et al. [1] proposed two blind signature schemes based on the discrete logarithm problem.

## Review of Camenisch et al.’s Schemes
The participants in the scheme are the signer and the requester. The details of Camenisch et al.’s DSA-based blind signature scheme are as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The signer selects a random number \( x \) and computes \( y = g^x \mod p \).
   - The signer also randomly selects \( k \) and computes \( r = g^k \mod p \).
   - The signer sends \( (y, r) \) to the requester.

2. **Requesting:**
   - The requester selects two random numbers \( a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_q \).
   - The requester calculates \( m' = m \cdot r^a \mod p \) and sends \( m' \) to the signer.

3. **Signing:**
   - The signer computes \( s = r^x \cdot m'^b \mod q \) and sends \( s \) back to the requester.

4. **Verification:**
   - The requester checks whether \( g^s \equiv y^{m'} \cdot r^b \mod p \) holds.
   - Anyone can verify the signature by checking if \( g^s \equiv y^m \cdot r^b \mod p \) holds.

## Lee et al.’s Traceability Attack
Lee et al. described a traceability attack on Camenisch et al.’s DSA-based blind signature scheme as follows:

1. The signer records all instances of \( (m, s, r, k) \).
2. After the requester publishes \( (m, s, r, k) \), the signer can calculate \( b_i = (s_i - r_i x) / k_i \mod q \).
3. The signer then computes \( a_i = (r_i - g^{b_i}) / k_i \mod p \).
4. Finally, the signer checks whether \( g^{a_i} \equiv r_i \mod p \) holds. If true, the signer can trace the blind signature.

## Analysis of Lee et al.’s Attack
Based on Lee et al.’s traceability attack, we analyze that the condition \( g^{a_i} \equiv r_i \mod p \) is always true. For a given \( (m, s, r, k) \), the signer can derive \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) such that \( g^{a_i} \equiv r_i \mod p \) holds for all instances of \( (m, s, r, k) \). Therefore, the attack is flawed.

## Conclusions
In this paper, we have analyzed and demonstrated that Lee et al.’s traceability attack on Camenisch et al.’s blind signature schemes is flawed. Although Lee et al.’s scheme satisfies the untraceability property, it is more complex than Camenisch et al.’s schemes.
