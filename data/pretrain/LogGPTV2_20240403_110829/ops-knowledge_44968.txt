### Issue Description
I am encountering an error while attempting to install the `PyCluster` package. My environment is as follows:

- Windows OS

### Error Details
When I try to install `PyCluster`, I receive the following error message:

```

### Suggested Workaround
It appears that `PyCluster` is not available on PyPI, which is why you are unable to install it. A possible alternative is to use the `pyclustering` library, which provides similar functionality and is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.x.

To install `pyclustering`, you can use the following command:

```sh
pip install pyclustering
```

This command should work with the Anaconda prompt as well.

If you specifically need `PyCluster` and it is not available, you might want to consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, as many libraries have discontinued support for Python 2.7. 

Thank you for your help!
