Hi.
I have a big structure data whose content changes dynamicaly, and in which I
want to observe tiny variables.  
For simplicity I made a code that is triggered on a click, code that call a
timeout in order to be sure that all pending works (jquery, vue, and any
others) are finished. In this timeout I change a boolean variable associated
to a html checkbox.  
So far, it seems that the html vue is not correctly updated after change to
the model from the timeout call.
### Vue.js version
2.1.8
### Reproduction Link
In the provided code/example, after a click on the html checkbox a timeout
(set to 5s) is called, in which the checkbox variable value is changed.
Here : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BpaXze  
The code:
      {{checkbox}}
### What is Expected?
I expect the checkbox to be updated after setting its value.
### What is actually happening?
The variable itself is correctly updated, but not the html checkbox.
