Figure 15: Fraction of dual-stack ASes reachable us-
ing an IPv4 AS path where all AS links in that path
are in the IPv6 AS-level graph. If IPv6 BGP paths
chosen were consistent with IPv4 paths, then 60% to
70% of ASes could be reached over a path congruent
in IPv4 and IPv6.

Figure 16: Fraction of dual-stack ASes reachable us-

then 95% of paths would be identical.
established equivalent peerings in IPv4 and IPv6, 95% of AS
paths could be identical in IPv4 and IPv6, i.e., for an AS
link on such a path, both ASes are present in the IPv6 topol-
ogy, and both ASes already peer in IPv4. If these ASes also
started IPv6 peering, we could see the AS paths converge.
These results are encouraging, but they are even more mo-
tivating when juxtaposed with performance measurements
which show IPv4 and IPv6 data plane performance is com-
parable when the AS paths are the same. Together, these
results demonstrate the undeniable beneﬁt of BGP peering
parity between IPv4 and IPv6 AS-level topologies.
8. RELATED WORK
Many attempts have been made to evaluate the status
of IPv6 adoption and penetration [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42, 43]. None have found signiﬁcant activity, even
though IPv6 has been implemented on all major network
and host operating systems. Current levels of observable
IPv6 activity fall well below 1% [40, 42, 43]. Google plots
a time-series of the percentage of Google users that would
access www.google.com over IPv6 if it had an IPv6 address,
547which moved from 0.1% in September 2008 to 0.6% in May
2012 [3]. By some accounts, IPv6 development is progress-
ing faster in Asian countries, e.g., China [44]. Notably, the
2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was the ﬁrst major world
event with a presence on the IPv6 Internet [45]. These mea-
surement studies were either focused on IPv6 capability, i.e.,
how many websites and clients were IPv6 capable, or on the
actual levels of IPv6 traﬃc on the network. In our work, we
have focused on IPv6 deployment at the level of organiza-
tions, represented in BGP as Autonomous Systems. Huston
and Michaelson [46] of APNIC examined a range of types of
data collected over four years (January 2004 to April 2008)
in search of IPv6 deployment activity. They analyzed inter-
domain routing announcements, APNIC’s web access logs,
and queries of reverse DNS zones that map IPv4 and IPv6
addresses back to domain names. All of their metrics showed
some increase in IPv6 deployment activity starting in the
second half of 2006, but they emphasized the data’s limita-
tions, since it mostly reﬂected some interest in IPv6 rather
than usable IPv6 support. More recently, Michaelson [47]
measured the disparity between IPv6 capability at the net-
work level, and IPv6 capability of end-users. Karpilovski et
al. [48] measured IPv6 deployment using data on address
allocation, BGP routing, and traﬃc. They concluded that
even though IPv6 address allocations were increasing, actual
traﬃc levels remained negligible. Huston [49] continuously
tracks the evolution of the IPv6 topology and routing, with
some high-level comparisons with the current state of IPv4.
Aben [50] provides an interactive look into the deployment
of IPv6 at the AS-level, further divided by country. To the
best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst work to compare and
contrast IPv6 evolution with that of the IPv4 ecosystem.
BGP update dynamics and scalability have been active
topics of research during the last decade or so, mostly for
the IPv4 topology, e.g. [33, 32]. Lately, however, there has
been some concern about the scalability of BGP interdomain
routing [25]. Huston [28] compared update churn in IPv4
and IPv6, and found that while churn in IPv4 does indeed
appear “ﬂat”, that in IPv6 increases exponentially. In this
paper, we compared IPv4 and IPv6 update dynamics, and
showed that they are qualitatively similar. The apparent
diﬀerence between the absolute volume of IPv4 and IPv6
updates over time is simply a function of the diﬀerent growth
rates of the underlying topologies – the IPv4 topology grows
linearly, while the IPv6 topology grows exponentially.
A recent measurement study by Nikkah et al. [16] com-
pared performance (measured in terms of web page down-
load times) over IPv4 and IPv6, with the goal of determining
whether the control plane or the data plane was responsible
for worse performance over IPv6. They found that while
the data plane performs comparably in IPv4 and IPv6, dif-
ferences in the control plane (routing) are responsible for
performance diﬀerences seen between IPv4 and IPv6. We
show web page download time is dominated by RTT because
the pages fetched are typically small, so these performance
measurements are dominated by delay rather than available
bandwidth. We also demonstrate there is signiﬁcantly more
gain that could be made with the existing ASes that have
deployed IPv6; if equivalent links are established in IPv6 as
in IPv4 then 95% of existing paths could be identical.
9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
With the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
now having exhausted its pool of available IPv4 addresses,
and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) scheduled to
run out in the near future, there has been growing inter-
est in how IPv6 is being deployed and used. In this paper,
we undertook the ﬁrst study of the evolution of IPv6 de-
ployment, comparing and contrasting it with how IPv4 has
evolved over the last decade and a half. Our ﬁndings hint
that the IPv6 network is indeed maturing, and while the
increasing pace of IPv6 uptake over the last two years is an
encouraging sign, IPv6 adoption is distinctly non-uniform,
both topologically and geographically. From the topologi-
cal perspective, IPv6 deployment is ahead in the core of the
network, driven by transit and content providers, while it
lags at the edges, which mostly consist of enterprise cus-
tomers. While the data at our disposal does not allow us
to study why deployment is lagging at the edge, we conjec-
ture that this is due to a lack of incentives for edge networks
to deploy IPv6, given available alternative strategies, e.g.,
NAT. For many edge networks, deploying IPv6 represents
a cost (transitioning infrastructure, training staﬀ, increased
management/troubleshooting overhead) without a tangible
beneﬁt. A single player, Hurricane Electric, predominates
the IPv6 topology signiﬁcantly more than the most predom-
inant AS in the IPv4 topology. This suggests that several
graph-theoretic metrics (e.g., average AS-path length) could
be signiﬁcantly skewed by the single large player in IPv6.
In terms of geographical trends, IPv6 adoption is higher in
Europe and the Asia Paciﬁc region. We conjecture that
adoption in the Asia-Paciﬁc region was spurred by IPv4 ad-
dress exhaustion, which happened ﬁrst in that region. A
big push toward IPv6 by network operators in the RIPE
region could explain why Europe is ahead of North Amer-
ica. From the point of view of routing dynamics, we ﬁnd
that IPv6 behaves mostly like IPv4. The diﬀerences in the
growth of the absolute volume of updates in IPv4 and IPv6
stem from the diﬀerent growth rates of the two topologies –
IPv4 now grows linearly in terms of ASes and preﬁxes, while
IPv6 grows exponentially. Finally, we ﬁnd that performance
over IPv6 paths is comparable to that over IPv4 if the AS-
level paths are the same, while it can be signiﬁcantly worse
when AS-level paths are diﬀerent. Interestingly, we found
that while only 40-50% of AS paths are currently identical
in IPv4 and IPv6, up to 95% of AS paths could be identical,
if current IPv6-capable ASes established equivalent peerings
in IPv4 and IPv6.
There are several avenues for future work. First, we plan
to keep collecting and processing topology and routing data
for both IPv4 and IPv6. We plan to release to the research
and operational communities periodic data tracking the evo-
lution of IPv6 topology and routing, to enable compari-
son with IPv4 evolution over the last 15 years. We expect
that such monitoring will become more useful as networks
move toward deploying IPv6 in production. In particular,
it will be interesting to measure if IPv6 deployment acceler-
ated following the World IPv6 Launch [51] event, scheduled
for June 6, 2012. Complementary to our eﬀorts in mea-
suring IPv6 deployment, we are developing a quantitative
model of IPv6 adoption at the organization level, which we
will parameterize and validate using our our ongoing mea-
surements. A crucial factor in determining whether IPv6
is widely adopted is the end-to-end performance achievable
548over IPv6, and whether that performance is comparable to
that achievable over IPv4. We plan to continue and extend
our current IPv6 performance measurements to identify or
rule out other causes of performance disparity beyond RTT,
such as loss, fragmentation, segmentation, and packet re-
ordering, and make results available to the community.
