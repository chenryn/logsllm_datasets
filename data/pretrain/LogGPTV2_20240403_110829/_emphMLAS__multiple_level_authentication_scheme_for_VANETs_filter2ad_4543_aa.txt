## Abstract

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerging networks that enable vehicles to communicate for enhanced driving safety. The basic idea is to allow vehicles to broadcast ad hoc messages (e.g., traffic accidents) to other vehicles. However, this raises concerns about security and privacy. Messages must be signed and verified before they can be trusted, while the real identity of vehicles should remain anonymous but traceable by authorized parties. Existing solutions either rely too heavily on tamper-proof hardware or lack effective message verification schemes. In this paper, we propose a multiple level authentication scheme that uses tamper-proof devices but removes the strong assumption of a preloaded long-term system master secret. Instead, the master secret can be updated as needed to enhance security. Messages are classified into regular and urgent types. Regular messages are verified using Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC), while urgent messages require RSU-aided verification through a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme. Simulations show that our scheme is more efficient than RSU-aided schemes, with up to 110 times lower verification delay. Our implementation also reveals that batch verification may not be as efficient as expected, and without it, the verification delay can be up to 173 times smaller.

## 1. Introduction

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are an emerging type of network designed to enhance driving safety through inter-vehicle communications and interactions with roadside infrastructure. Each vehicle is equipped with an On-Board Unit (OBU), and Road-Side Units (RSUs) are installed along roads. A Trusted Authority (TA) and application servers are located in the backend. OBUs and RSUs communicate using the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) protocol over a wireless channel, while RSUs, TA, and application servers use a secure fixed network (e.g., the Internet). The primary application of VANETs is to allow vehicles to broadcast safety messages (e.g., road conditions, traffic accidents) to nearby vehicles and RSUs, enabling route adjustments and traffic light changes to avoid congestion.

Security and privacy are critical in VANETs. Messages from OBUs must be integrity-checked and authenticated to prevent attacks such as message modification or impersonation. Additionally, privacy is a significant concern; drivers may not want their travel routes to be traced. While some existing solutions address these issues, they often treat all messages uniformly, which is inefficient. In this paper, we classify messages into regular and urgent types and propose different verification methods for each. Regular messages, which are periodic and non-urgent, are verified using HMAC, while urgent messages, which are critical, are verified with RSU-aided conditional privacy-preserving authentication. Our scheme also allows for updating the system master secret, enhancing security. Simulations and analysis show that our scheme is both effective and efficient, with significantly lower verification delays compared to existing protocols.

## 2. Related Work

Traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital signatures are commonly used for integrity-checking and authentication. However, PKI-based approaches can be computationally intensive for OBUs, especially in high-traffic areas. Some recent works, such as [3, 4, 8–15], have proposed alternative solutions. For example, the IBV protocol [3] uses batch verification with tamper-proof hardware, but it relies on a preloaded system-wide secret key, making it vulnerable if one device is compromised. The RAISE protocol [4] allows vehicle-to-vehicle communication with RSU assistance but incurs high message overhead. SPECS [5] proposes group communication protocols, but these can be complex and inefficient. Other efforts, such as [9, 10], focus on physical signal properties and HMAC-based solutions to improve efficiency. Group signature schemes [11–13] offer conditional privacy but are also complex. Secure VANET applications, such as [14, 15], address specific use cases like parking and toll calculation.

## 3. Problem Statement

### System Model and Assumptions

A VANET consists of OBUs, RSUs, and a TA. We focus on inter-vehicle communications over the wireless channel. Our assumptions include:
1. The TA is trusted and periodically online for updating the system master secret key. RSUs and TA communicate via a secure fixed network.
2. RSUs have higher computational power than OBUs.
3. The RSU-to-vehicle communication range is at least twice the inter-vehicle communication range.
4. A conventional PKI exists for distributing the system master secret.
5. Only the TA and the vehicle itself know the real identity of any vehicle.

### Security Requirements

Our scheme aims to meet the following security requirements:
1. **Message Integrity and Authentication:** Any vehicle should be able to verify that a message is sent and signed by an authorized tamper-proof device. RSUs and TA should also be able to verify the message's origin.
2. **Identity Privacy Preserving:** The real identity of a vehicle should be kept anonymous from other vehicles.
3. **Traceability and Revocability:** The TA should be able to obtain a vehicle's real identity when necessary, such as for urgent messages.

## 4. Preliminaries

Our scheme uses PKI for distributing the system master secret, HMAC for verifying regular messages, pairing-based mechanisms for verifying urgent messages, and proxy re-encryption for RSUs to re-encrypt the system master secret. We briefly introduce these concepts below.

### 4.1. Public-Key Encryption

Public-key encryption, also known as asymmetric encryption, involves a trusted party assigning each user a pair of public and private keys. The public key is known to everyone, while the private key is kept secret. To securely send a message, the sender encrypts the message using the receiver's public key, and the receiver decrypts it using the corresponding private key. RSA [17] is a well-known algorithm for public-key encryption. We denote the process of encrypting plaintext \( M \) with public key \( PK \) to obtain ciphertext \( C \) as \( C = AS\_ENCPK(M) \).

### 4.2. Public-Key Digital Signature

Public-key digital signatures involve a signer using their private key to create a signature, which can be verified by anyone using the signer's public key. This ensures the message's authenticity and integrity. We denote the process of signing a message \( M \) with a private key \( SK \) to produce a signature \( S \) as \( S = SIGN_{SK}(M) \), and the verification process as \( VERIFY_{PK}(M, S) \).

## 5. Proposed Scheme

### 5.1. System Setup

1. **Key Generation:**
   - The TA generates a system master secret \( MS \) and a corresponding public key \( MPK \).
   - The TA distributes \( MPK \) to all OBUs and RSUs via the PKI.
   - The TA securely transmits \( MS \) to each OBU using a secure channel.

2. **Message Classification:**
   - **Regular Messages:** These are periodic and non-urgent messages, such as vehicle status updates.
   - **Urgent Messages:** These are critical messages, such as accident reports.

### 5.2. Regular Message Verification

1. **Message Signing:**
   - An OBU signs a regular message \( M \) using HMAC with the system master secret \( MS \): \( HMAC_{MS}(M) \).

2. **Message Verification:**
   - Neighboring vehicles verify the HMAC using the same system master secret \( MS \).

### 5.3. Urgent Message Verification

1. **Message Signing:**
   - An OBU signs an urgent message \( M \) using a pairing-based mechanism with the system master secret \( MS \).

2. **Message Verification:**
   - Nearby RSUs verify the message using the system master secret \( MS \) and a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme.
   - If necessary, the TA can reveal the real identity of the sender.

### 5.4. System Master Secret Update

- The TA can update the system master secret \( MS \) if a tamper-proof device is compromised.
- The updated secret is securely transmitted to all OBUs.

## 6. Analysis and Evaluation

### 6.1. Security Analysis

- **Integrity and Authentication:** Our scheme ensures that messages are signed and verified, preventing unauthorized modifications and impersonation.
- **Privacy Preservation:** The real identity of vehicles remains anonymous, except when revealed by the TA for urgent messages.
- **Traceability and Revocability:** The TA can trace and revoke the identity of a vehicle if necessary.

### 6.2. Performance Evaluation

- **Verification Delay:** Simulations show that our scheme has up to 110 times lower verification delay compared to RSU-aided schemes.
- **Batch Verification Efficiency:** Our implementation reveals that batch verification may not be as efficient as expected. Without batch verification, the verification delay can be up to 173 times smaller.

## 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a multiple level authentication scheme for VANETs that classifies messages into regular and urgent types and uses different verification methods for each. Our scheme enhances security by allowing the system master secret to be updated and provides efficient verification with significantly lower delays. Future work will focus on further optimizing the scheme and addressing additional security and privacy challenges in VANETs.
