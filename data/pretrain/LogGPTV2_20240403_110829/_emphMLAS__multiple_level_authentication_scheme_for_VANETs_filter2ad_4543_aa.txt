The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging type of network which enables vehi-
cles on roads to inter-communicate for driving safety. The basic idea is to allow arbitrary
vehicles to broadcast ad hoc messages (e.g. trafﬁc accidents) to other vehicles. However,
this raises the concern of security and privacy. Messages should be signed and veriﬁed
before they are trusted while the real identity of vehicles should not be revealed, but trace-
able by authorized party. Existing solutions either rely too heavily on a tamper-proof hard-
ware device, or do not have an effective message veriﬁcation scheme. In this paper, we
propose a multiple level authentication scheme which still makes use of tamper-proof
devices but the strong assumption that a long-term system master secret is preloaded into
all tamper-proof devices is removed. Instead the master secret can be updated if needed to
increase the security level. On the other hand, messages sent by vehicles are classiﬁed into
two types – regular messages and urgent messages. Regular messages can be veriﬁed by
neighboring vehicles by means of Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) while
urgent messages can only be veriﬁed with the aid of RSUs nearby by means of a conditional
privacy-preserving authentication scheme. Through extensive simulation, we show that
our multiple level authentication scheme is much more efﬁcient that those RSU-aided
authentication scheme as long as the proportion of urgent messages is less than 100%.
The veriﬁcation delay required can be up to 110 times smaller than other protocols. Our
implementation shows that batch veriﬁcation may not be as efﬁcient as expected. In case
without batch veriﬁcation, the veriﬁcation delay required by our scheme can even be up to
173 times smaller.

1. Introduction
The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging
type of network by which driving safety can be enhanced
through inter-vehicle communications or communications
with roadside infrastructure. It is an important element of
the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) [1]. In a typi-
cal VANET, each vehicle is assumed to have an on-board
unit (OBU) and there are road-side units (RSUs) installed
along the roads. A trusted authority (TA) and maybe some
other application servers are installed in the backend. The

OBUs and RSUs communicate using the Dedicated Short
Range Communication (DSRC) protocol [2] over the wire-
less channel while the RSUs, TA, and the application serv-
ers communicate using a secure ﬁxed network (e.g. the
Internet). The basic application of a VANET is to allow arbi-
trary vehicles to broadcast safety messages (e.g. road con-
dition,
to other nearby
vehicles and RSU such that other vehicles may adjust their
travelling routes and RSU may inform the trafﬁc
control center to adjust trafﬁc lights for avoiding possible
trafﬁc congestion. This paper focuses on inter-vehicle
communications.
trafﬁc accident
information)
Like other communication networks, security issues
have to be well-addressed. For example, the message from
an OBU has to be integrity-checked and authenticated

before it can be relied on. Otherwise, an attacker can mod-
ify a vehicle’s safety message or even impersonate a vehi-
cle to transmit a fake safety message. For example, a boy
may impersonate an ambulance to request other vehicles
to give way to him or request nearby RSUs to change trafﬁc
lights to green so that he can catch up an appointment
with his girl friend. Besides, privacy is another issue that
raises a lot of concern in recent years. A driver may not
want others to know its travelling routes by tracing mes-
sages sent by its OBU. Someone may argue that in current
road system, a vehicle can already be traced by means of its
license plate number. However, most parts of VANET are
automatic (e.g. the status of a vehicle will be broadcasted
by its OBU periodically and automatically) and such an
automatic messaging system should not leak a driver’s pri-
vacy any easier than the current situation. Thus an anony-
mous communications protocol is needed. While being
anonymous, a vehicle’s real identity should be able to be
revealed by a trusted party when necessary. For example,
the driver who sent out fake messages causing an accident
should not be able to escape by using an anonymous iden-
tity. Thus we call this kind of privacy conditional privacy.
Privacy-preserving authentication schemes have been
discussed in the research community for a while. Examples
include [3–5]. However, all of them propose having the
same treatment to all messages. This is obviously impro-
per. Some messages are more urgent than others. In fact,
in daily operation of a VANET, more than 90% of messages
are regular (non-urgent) messages such as those about
change of travelling speed and turning direction. Urgent
messages only appear when there are accidents or unex-
pected road conditions. Therefore, adopting the same
authentication scheme (and with the same security level)
to both regular and urgent messages usually yields a waste
of power. In this paper, we propose to ﬁrst classify mes-
sages sent by a vehicle into regular messages and urgent
messages. Regular messages refer to those that are sent
periodically (every 500 ms according to the DSRC [2] stan-
dard). They are usually about the current status of a vehicle
including its travelling speed, turning direction and brake
application. Urgent messages, on the other hand, refer to
those that are sent when there are critical road situations
such as accidents and road blocking. Messages sent by a
ﬁre engine or an ambulance are also considered as urgent
since slowing down their travelling speed can cause loss
of human life or property. We then propose different treat-
ments on the two kinds of messages. For regular messages,
the receiving vehicle only needs to show that they were
generated and sent by a trusted tamper-proof device while
for urgent messages, we provide a mechanism for a trusted
party to reveal the real identity of the sender. That is, at-
tacks caused by a vehicle are accountable.
Talking about tamper-proof devices, some existing
schemes also assume the existence of them. However, their
security assumption is too strong to be accepted. They as-
sume that a long-term master secret key is preloaded into
all tamper-proof devices and all security functions rely on
it. In this sense, once one of the temper-proof devices is
cracked and the system master secret is leaked to an at-
tacker, the whole system will be compromised. In this pa-
per, we use tamper-proof devices with a weaker security
assumption. We still need a system master secret for secu-
rity functions. However, instead of preloading them into
tamper-proof devices permanently, we propose to trans-
mit them to vehicles in a secure way. Also the system mas-
ter secret can be updated when any tamper-proof device is
proved to be compromised. This can help to raise the secu-
rity level of the system.
Through security analysis and extensive simulation, we
show that our schemes achieve the goals of authenticity,
conditional privacy preserving and traceability. At the
same time, the veriﬁcation time is much shorter than pre-
vious schemes. The veriﬁcation delay required by our
scheme can be up to 110 times smaller than other proto-
cols. On the other hand, our implementation shows that
batch veriﬁcation may not be as efﬁcient as expected. In
case without batch veriﬁcation, the veriﬁcation delay re-
quired can even be up to 173 times smaller. Hence our
scheme is both effective and efﬁcient.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Related works are presented in Section 2. The system model
and the problem statement are described in Section 3.
Some preliminaries about bilinear maps are given in Sec-
tion 4. Our schemes are presented in details in Section 5.
The analysis and evaluation of our schemes are given in
Sections 6 and 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.
2. Related work
In terms of integrity-checking and authentication, digi-
tal signature in conventional public key infrastructure
(PKI) [6] is a well accepted choice. However, requiring a
vehicle to verify the PKI signatures of other vehicles by it-
self as in works like [7] induces two problems as men-
tioned in [4]. First, the computation power of an OBU is
not strong enough to handle all veriﬁcations in a short
time, especially in places where the trafﬁc density is high.
Second, to verify a message from an unknown vehicle in-
volves the transmission of a public key certiﬁcate which
causes heavy message overhead. Therefore, one possible
approach is to let the nearby RSU to help a vehicle to verify
the message of another.
Related problems have been addressed in some recent
works [4,3,8–15]. In [3], the IBV protocol was proposed
for vehicle-to-RSU communications. The RSU can verify a
large number of signatures as a batch using three pairing
operations (see the Section 4 for what a pairing operation
is). However, their work relies heavily on a tamper-proof
hardware device, installed in each vehicle, which preloads
the system-wide secret key. Once one of these devices is
cracked, the whole system will be compromised. On the
other hand, by actual
implementation, we found that
batch veriﬁcation is not as efﬁcient as they argue. Finally,
the IBV protocol is not designed for vehicle-to-vehicle
communications.
In a more recent work [4], the RAISE protocol was pro-
posed for vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The protocol
is software-based. It allows a vehicle to verify the signature
of another with the aid of a nearby RSU. To notify other
vehicles whether a message from a certain vehicle is valid,
a hash value of 128 bytes needs to be broadcasted. There

can be tens up to thousands of signatures within a short
period of time, thus the notiﬁcation messages induce a
heavy message overhead. In another recent work, SPECS
[5], some security and privacy-enhancing communications
schemes were proposed. Of particular interest, a group
communications protocol was deﬁned. After a simple
handshaking with any RSU, a group of known vehicles
can verify the signature of each other without any further
support from RSUs. A common group secret is also devel-
oped for secure communications among group members.
Other recent efforts for making authentication in
VANETs more efﬁcient include [9,10]. In [9], the authors
propose to use the physical property of a transmitting sig-
nal to discriminate one transmitter from others because
physical measurement is more efﬁcient than software
computation. [10], on the other hand, aims at enhancing
the efﬁciency of any certiﬁcate-based authentication
scheme. The authors propose a HMAC-based solution to re-
place the time-consuming and traditional certiﬁcate revo-
cation list checking process. Regarding conditional privacy
preserving, some recent works [11–13] propose to achieve
the goal by using group signature schemes. That is, each
vehicle in the system is assigned a group private key. When
a vehicle wants to broadcast a message, it signs the mes-
sage using its group private key. Veriﬁers such as RSUs
can then verify its signature using a common group public
key. In this way, a signature can be properly veriﬁed but at
the same time, the real identity of the signer can be hidden.
Only if necessary, a trusted party can use a private key to
reveal the real identity of the signer. Though conditional
privacy preserving can be achieved, we argue that such
group signature schemes are complicated and inefﬁcient.
In terms of secure VANET applications, [14,15] are two
representatives. [14] proposes a secure navigation scheme
for locating parking lots in a car park while [15] proposes a
secure and privacy preserving road toll calculation scheme
under the principle of multi-party computation.
3. Problem statement
This section explains our system model, assumptions
and security requirements.
System model and assumptions: Recall that a vehicu-
lar network consists of on-board units (OBUs) installed on
vehicles, road-side units (RSUs) along the roads, and a
trusted authority (TA). We focus on the inter-vehicle com-
munications over the wireless channel. We assume the
followings:
1. The TA is trusted and is online periodically and when
needed for updating system master secret key. RSUs
and TA communicate through a secure ﬁxed network.
To avoid being a single point of failure or a bottleneck,
redundant TAs which have identical
functionalities
and databases are installed.
2. The RSUs have higher computation power than OBUs.
3. The RSU to Vehicle Communication (RVC) range is at
least twice of the Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC)
range. In this way, all vehicles receiving the same mes-
sage as the RSU are in the feasible range to receive the
notiﬁcation from the RSU.
4. There exists a conventional public key infrastructure
(PKI) for the distribution of system master secret. We
will talk about the details in Section 5.1.
5. The real identity of any vehicle is only known by the TA
and itself but not by others.
Security requirements: We aim at designing a scheme
to satisfy the following security requirements:
1. Message integrity and authentication: Whenever a vehi-
cle sends a message, any other vehicle should be able
to verify that the message is indeed sent and signed
by an authorized tamper-proof device without being
modiﬁed by anyone. At the same time, any RSU and
TA together should be able to verify that the message
is indeed sent and signed by a registered vehicle with-
out being modiﬁed by anyone. They can then inform
other vehicles the veriﬁcation result.
2. Identity privacy preserving: The real identity of a vehicle
should be kept anonymous from other vehicles and a
third-party should not be able to reveal a vehicle’s real
identity by analysing multiple messages sent by it.
3. Traceability and revocability: Although a vehicle’s real
identity should be hidden from other vehicles, if neces-
sary (e.g. in case of urgent messages), the TA should
have the ability to obtain a vehicle’s real identity.
4. Preliminaries
Our scheme adopts public key infrastructure (PKI) for
the distribution of system master secret, adopts Hash-based
Message Authentication Code (HMAC) for the veriﬁcation
of regular messages, adopts pairing-based mechanism
(deﬁned on two cyclic groups with a bilinear mapping
[16]) for the veriﬁcation of urgent messages and makes use
of proxy re-encryption technique for an RSU to re-encrypt
system master secret to different vehicles. We brieﬂy
introduce each of these concepts in this section.
4.1. Public-key encryption
Public-key encryption is a function provided by the
public key infrastructure (PKI) and is also known as asym-
metric encryption. A trusted party assigns each user a pair
of public key and private key. The public key can be known
by everyone while the private key is kept secret. To se-
curely send a message, the sender encrypts the message
using the receiver’s public key. The receiver can then ob-
tain the message by decrypting using the corresponding
private key. RSA [17] is a well-known algorithm for pub-
lic-key encryption. Throughout this paper, we denote the
process of encrypting plaintext M with public key PK to ob-
tain ciphertext C as C = AS_ENCPK(M).
4.2. Public-key digital signature
Public-key digital signature is another function pro-
