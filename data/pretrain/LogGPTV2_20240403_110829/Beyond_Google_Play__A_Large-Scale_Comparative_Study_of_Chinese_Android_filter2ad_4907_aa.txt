ABSTRACT
China is one of the largest Android markets in the world. As Chinese
users cannot access Google Play to buy and install Android apps,
a number of independent app stores have emerged and compete
in the Chinese app market. Some of the Chinese app stores are
pre-installed vendor-specific app markets (e.g., Huawei, Xiaomi and
OPPO), whereas others are maintained by large tech companies
(e.g., Baidu, Qihoo 360 and Tencent). The nature of these app stores
and the content available through them vary greatly, including their
trustworthiness and security guarantees.
As of today, the research community has not studied the Chinese
Android ecosystem in depth. To fill this gap, we present the first
large-scale comparative study that covers more than 6 million An-
droid apps downloaded from 16 Chinese app markets and Google
Play. We focus our study on catalog similarity across app stores,
their features, publishing dynamics, and the prevalence of various
forms of misbehavior (including the presence of fake, cloned and
malicious apps). Our findings also suggest heterogeneous developer
behavior across app stores, in terms of code maintenance, use of
third-party services, and so forth. Overall, Chinese app markets
perform substantially worse when taking active measures to pro-
tect mobile users and legit developers from deceptive and abusive
actors, showing a significantly higher prevalence of malware, fake,
and cloned apps than Google Play.

1 INTRODUCTION
According to recent reports, there are more than 700 million An-
droid users in China [84]. Due to the restriction of Google’s services
in China since late 2010 – and by extension of Google Play [46, 73]
– hundreds of millions of Chinese Android users resort to alterna-
tive markets to buy and install Android apps. This restriction over
Google services in China has been seen as a business opportunity
by many Chinese Internet companies (e.g., Tencent and Baidu) and
smartphone manufacturers (e.g., Huawei and Xiaomi). Despite the
fact that these app markets target mainly the Chinese Android
users, they are also available to users from all over the world.
The diversity and large number of third-party markets in China
have made it difficult for both mobile users and app developers to
choose the most appropriate one(s) to discover or distribute their
apps. This state of affairs has also opened new opportunities for
malicious actors: previous work has suggested that repackaged
apps, including malware, are widely distributed in Google Play, but
especially through third-party markets [52, 53, 57, 58, 60, 89, 102].
To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has performed
a systematic and comparative study across different app markets,
including the Chinese ones. To fill this research gap, we perform
a multi-dimensional and large-scale study covering more than 6.2
million apps to identify the differences between Google Play and
16 popular Chinese Android app markets. We begin our study by
offering a high-level characterization of these app stores, discussing
features such as their copyright checks, app auditing processes, their
strategies to attract app developers, and their transparency efforts
(Section 2). Second, after presenting our dataset and app collection
method (Section 3), we compare their download distributions, user
rating distributions, and presence of third-party tracking and adver-
tising libraries (Section 4). Third, we study their catalog similarities
and their publication dynamics, with emphasis on detecting the dis-
tribution of the presence of a given developer and app across stores
(Section 5). We then provide an in-depth analysis of malicious and
deceptive behaviors across app markets, discussing the presence of
fake and cloned apps, over-privileged apps, and malware (Section 6).
We conclude our paper with a discussion around the state of affairs
in the Chinese Android ecosystem, and its implications to users
and developers alike (Section 7).

Our main research contributions are as follows:
• We conduct a comparative study of various intra- and inter-
market features. Our results reveal a long tail distribution of app
popularity, with the top 1% of apps usually accounting for over
80% of total downloads across the 17 studied markets. Further, we
observe the presence of heterogeneous behaviors across markets
(e.g., in terms of code maintenance and metadata consistency).
• We find that the set of third-party libraries (e.g., SDKs provided
by advertising and tracking services) embedded in Android apps
are different for those published in Chinese stores than in Google
Play. This observation could be explained by the inability to
access Google services such as Google Analytics and AdMob
from China, and Chinese developers’ need to monetize their apps
through services specialized in the Chinese market.
• Popular apps are more likely to be simultaneously published in
multiple markets compared to unpopular ones. However, there
is a strong market bias across developers: 1) 57% of Google Play
developers do not publish their apps on any of the Chinese mar-
kets, and 2) almost half of the Chinese-specific developers do not
publish apps in Google Play.
• We analyze the prevalence of various types of malicious behav-
iors in our dataset, specifically the presence of fake and cloned
apps, over-privileged apps, and malware. Google Play clearly out-
performs Chinese markets in all dimensions of our study thanks
to their positive efforts to eradicate these behaviors. Our results
reveal that the presence of malicious and repackaged apps in the
majority of Chinese app stores is significant and prevalent over
time (10%, on average, in the case of malware), in some cases
reaching almost 1 in 4 apps in the market.
• In order to estimate the extent to which app markets implement
security checks on submissions, we performed a second crawl
8 months after the first snapshot. Our exploration suggests that
over 84% of the potentially malicious apps found in Google Play
were removed. This differs considerably in the case of Chinese
markets, with malware removal ratios varying from 0.01% to
34.51% in the best case.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative study
between Google Play and alternative Chinese app stores at scale,
longitudinally and across various dimensions. Our results motivate
the need for more research efforts to illuminate the widely unex-
plored Chinese mobile and web ecosystem. We believe that our
efforts can positively contribute to bring user and developer aware-
ness, attract the focus of the research community and regulators,
and promote best operational practices across app store operators.

2 CHINESE ANDROID APP MARKETS
Due to the access restrictions of Google Play in China, Chinese
Android users resort to a large ecosystem of alternative third-party
Android app markets, which could be classified into three categories
according to their nature:
• Vendor-specific app markets. China has a vast and powerful
smartphone manufacturing industry with well-known vendors
such as Huawei, Xiaomi, and Lenovo. Almost every Chinese
smartphone vendor maintains its own app market, which also
comes pre-installed on their devices.
• Web companies. Chinese Internet giants such as 360, Baidu, and
Tencent also compete in the Chinese Android market with their
own app stores. These companies usually provide support to
some smartphone vendors behind the scenes. For example, the
Sony app store in China is powered by Baidu App Market, and
the Smartisan app store is supported by Tencent Myapp Market.
• Specialized markets. A number of relatively small Chinese com-
panies are specialized in Android app services. They usually make
profit through app promotion and other business-oriented part-
nerships with app developers/companies. For example, 25PP is
an Android app market powered by the PP smartphone assistant,
which is a popular management system app in China. Similarly,
Wandoujia is an app store provided by a company focused on
app recommendation, especially for mobile games.
In this study, we first resort to several independent industry
reports about app market ranking in China [3–5, 14, 29, 30]. We
cover all the top 10 Android markets in China, excluding the Vivo
market (ranks 6 to 10 in China), because the Vivo market does
not provide a web-based app download interface, which makes it
difficult for us to crawl the apps. Our list covers the app stores for
the top five smartphone vendors in China [27], three top Chinese
web companies, and eight popular specialized Android app markets.
The app markets in this list cover more than 98% of active users in
China [3, 29]. The majority of these markets target Chinese Android
users, but some of them operate at a global scale, particularly those
run by Android handset vendors. For example, Huawei’s app market
is also popular in Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East [20].
2.1 Features of Chinese App Markets
In this section, we study some critical aspects and features across
app stores, including their openness to developers, their publication
and app auditing process, and their transparency, as shown in
Table 1. For that, we first registered a developer account for each
market and then manually examined their developer policies, terms
of service and other documents released by these markets [6, 8, 12,
13, 15–17, 21–25, 28, 33].
(1) Openness: Most Chinese app markets allow third-party devel-
opers to publish their apps for free2. However, a small number of
app stores enforce some limitations. For instance, Lenovo’s MM
market only allows registered companies to release apps [22],
whereas OPPO market only allows publishing apps falling in
specific categories, such as “wallpaper” and “theme” apps [25].
Vendor markets such as OPPO and Xiaomi force developers
to release apps that are fully compatible with their own de-
vices [25, 33]. Finally, App China explicitly limits an APK size
to 50 MB [13].
(2) Copyright checks: In order to limit the publication of fake
and cloned apps, all the Chinese markets but HiApk and PC
Online perform copyright ownership checks. Developers should
submit a “Software Copyright Certificate” indicating that they
are the original authors of the released apps.
(3) Publishing incentives: Chinese app stores provide a number
of incentive mechanisms for encouraging app developers to
2Google Play’s registration fee costs $25 [19].
