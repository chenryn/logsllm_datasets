**Abstract:**
China is one of the largest Android markets globally. Due to the inaccessibility of Google Play, numerous independent app stores have emerged, competing in the Chinese app market. These include pre-installed vendor-specific app markets (e.g., Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO) and those maintained by large tech companies (e.g., Baidu, Qihoo 360, Tencent). The nature, trustworthiness, and security guarantees of these app stores vary significantly.

To date, the research community has not thoroughly studied the Chinese Android ecosystem. This paper presents the first large-scale comparative study, covering over 6 million Android apps from 16 Chinese app markets and Google Play. We focus on catalog similarity, features, publishing dynamics, and the prevalence of misbehavior, including fake, cloned, and malicious apps. Our findings indicate heterogeneous developer behavior across app stores, particularly in code maintenance and third-party service usage. Overall, Chinese app markets perform worse in protecting users and developers from deceptive and abusive actors, with a higher prevalence of malware, fake, and cloned apps compared to Google Play.

## 1 Introduction
According to recent reports, there are more than 700 million Android users in China [84]. Since the restriction of Google services in late 2010, including Google Play [46, 73], Chinese Android users have turned to alternative app markets. This situation has been seen as a business opportunity by many Chinese Internet companies (e.g., Tencent and Baidu) and smartphone manufacturers (e.g., Huawei and Xiaomi). Despite targeting mainly Chinese users, these app markets are also accessible worldwide.

The diversity and number of third-party markets in China have made it challenging for both mobile users and app developers to choose the most suitable ones for discovering or distributing apps. This has also opened new opportunities for malicious actors. Previous studies have suggested that repackaged apps, including malware, are widely distributed in Google Play but even more so through third-party markets [52, 53, 57, 58, 60, 89, 102].

To our knowledge, no previous work has conducted a systematic and comparative study across different app markets, including the Chinese ones. To fill this gap, we perform a multi-dimensional and large-scale study covering over 6.2 million apps to identify differences between Google Play and 16 popular Chinese Android app markets. We begin by characterizing these app stores, discussing their copyright checks, app auditing processes, strategies to attract app developers, and transparency efforts (Section 2). After presenting our dataset and app collection method (Section 3), we compare their download distributions, user rating distributions, and the presence of third-party tracking and advertising libraries (Section 4). We then study their catalog similarities and publication dynamics, focusing on the distribution of developers and apps across stores (Section 5). We provide an in-depth analysis of malicious and deceptive behaviors, discussing the presence of fake and cloned apps, over-privileged apps, and malware (Section 6). Finally, we discuss the state of the Chinese Android ecosystem and its implications for users and developers (Section 7).

Our main research contributions are:
- **Comparative Study:** We conduct a comparative study of various intra- and inter-market features, revealing a long-tail distribution of app popularity and heterogeneous behaviors across markets.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** We find that the set of third-party libraries embedded in Android apps differs between Chinese stores and Google Play, likely due to the inability to access Google services such as Google Analytics and AdMob in China.
- **Market Bias:** Popular apps are more likely to be published in multiple markets, but there is a strong market bias: 57% of Google Play developers do not publish in any Chinese markets, and almost half of Chinese-specific developers do not publish in Google Play.
- **Malicious Behaviors:** We analyze the prevalence of various types of malicious behaviors, finding that Google Play outperforms Chinese markets in eradicating these behaviors. Malware and repackaged apps are prevalent in Chinese markets, with an average of 10% of apps being malware.
- **Security Checks:** We estimate the extent to which app markets implement security checks by performing a second crawl 8 months after the initial snapshot. Over 84% of potentially malicious apps found in Google Play were removed, while removal ratios in Chinese markets varied from 0.01% to 34.51%.

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study between Google Play and alternative Chinese app stores at scale, longitudinally, and across various dimensions. Our results highlight the need for more research into the Chinese mobile and web ecosystem, promoting user and developer awareness, attracting the focus of the research community and regulators, and promoting best operational practices across app store operators. We have released our dataset and experiment results to the research community at: http://market.orangeapk.com/

## 2 Chinese Android App Markets
Due to the restrictions on Google Play in China, Chinese Android users rely on a large ecosystem of alternative third-party app markets, which can be classified into three categories:

- **Vendor-Specific App Markets:** Major smartphone vendors like Huawei, Xiaomi, and Lenovo maintain their own app markets, often pre-installed on their devices.
- **Web Companies:** Internet giants such as 360, Baidu, and Tencent also operate app stores, sometimes providing support to other smartphone vendors. For example, the Sony app store in China is powered by Baidu App Market, and the Smartisan app store is supported by Tencent Myapp Market.
- **Specialized Markets:** Smaller companies specializing in Android app services, such as 25PP and Wandoujia, make profits through app promotion and partnerships with app developers.

In this study, we refer to several independent industry reports about app market rankings in China [3–5, 14, 29, 30]. We cover the top 10 Android markets in China, excluding the Vivo market, which does not provide a web-based app download interface. Our list includes the app stores of the top five smartphone vendors, three top Chinese web companies, and eight popular specialized Android app markets, covering over 98% of active users in China [3, 29]. While most of these markets target Chinese users, some, especially those run by smartphone vendors, operate globally. For example, Huawei’s app market is popular in Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East [20].

### 2.1 Features of Chinese App Markets
We study critical aspects and features of these app stores, including their openness to developers, publication and app auditing processes, and transparency (Table 1). We registered a developer account for each market and manually examined their policies and terms of service [6, 8, 12, 13, 15–17, 21–25, 28, 33].

1. **Openness:** Most Chinese app markets allow third-party developers to publish apps for free. However, some have limitations. For example, Lenovo’s MM market only allows registered companies to release apps [22], and OPPO market restricts app categories [25]. Vendor markets like OPPO and Xiaomi require apps to be fully compatible with their devices [25, 33], and App China limits APK size to 50 MB [13].
2. **Copyright Checks:** All Chinese markets except HiApk and PC Online perform copyright ownership checks, requiring developers to submit a “Software Copyright Certificate.”
3. **Publishing Incentives:** Chinese app stores offer various incentives to encourage developers, such as revenue sharing and promotional support.
