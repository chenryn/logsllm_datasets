**Instructions:**
Let's try this again, but this time using margins. Use Clockwise Notation to set the margin of an element to **40 pixels on its top and left side**, and 20 pixels on its bottom and right side.

**Criteria:**
- The `green-box` class should give the top of elements 40px of margin.
- The `green-box` class should give the left of elements 40px of margin.
- The `green-box` class should give the bottom of elements 20px of margin.
- The `green-box` class should give the right of elements 20px of margin.

**Acceptable Solution:**
```css
margin: 40px 20px 20px 40px;
```

To align the criteria with the instructions, please ensure that the top margin is set to 40px.

Cheers!
