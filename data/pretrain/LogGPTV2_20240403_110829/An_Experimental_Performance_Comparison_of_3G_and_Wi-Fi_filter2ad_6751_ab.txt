always select the AP with the strongest signal, while moving, this was generally
not the optimum choice. When the client approaches a potential AP, it would
be best to select the AP that would be just coming into range to maximize the
usable connection duration. We found that many connection attempts succeeded
but when the data transfer was about to begin, the connection was severed. This
does not mean that opportunistic contacts cannot happen at speeds, but instead
brings to light the need for faster AP association and setup techniques similar
to QuickWiFi[4] and better AP selection algorithms for mobile clients. Both of
these would allow better exploitation of opportunistic transactions for in-motion
scenarios.
Also plotted in Figure 2 is the total amount of data transferred for each
access technology. The 3G connection is always connected throughout the entire
experiment and shows a linear increase in the total bytes received. Wi-Fi, is
represented by a step function which highlights how each connection opportunity
beneﬁts the overall amount of data received. Each point on the “Wi-Fi total” line
represents a successful contact with an AP. Even though Wi-Fi contacts show
large variability due to the intermittent nature of the contact opportunities, there
is still a signiﬁcant amount of data transferred because of the higher data rates
of the technology. This is more apparent in the walking experiments where the
speeds are much slower and the use of the sidewalks brings the client physically
closer to the APs, allowing the client to remain connected for longer durations.
Figure 3 shows throughput results of a single, representative experiment for 3G
and Wi-Fi at walking speeds. The walking experiments last around 3385 seconds
and 3G is able to transfer around 285 MB of data. Wi-Fi, on the other hand,
is only connected for 1353 seconds of the experiment and downloads 210 MB.
Again, each Wi-Fi contact is able to exploit the opportunity and take advantage
of very short, high throughput contacts, transferring signiﬁcant amounts of data.
3.2 3G vs Wi-Fi Uploads
Figure 4 shows the instantaneous throughput of 3G and Wi-Fi uploads at walking
speeds. It has a similar behavior to that of the downloads described previously
but this time, the total data transferred for Wi-Fi exceeds 3G by 2.6 times. This
is due to poor upload performance of 3G on the mobile device.

The instantaneous 3G traﬃc pattern shows transitioning between idle states
and periods of data transfers that result in throughput much less than that of the
downloads (averaging at 130 kbits/s). In order to understand this phenomenon,
we performed additional experiments with a stationary laptop (Lenovo T500
using the iPhone SIM card) and the iPhone with updated software and baseband
ﬁrmware, 3.0 (7A341) and 04.26.08 respectively. We found that this periodic
pattern is no longer evident. The new traces exhibit more consistent, albeit lower,
throughput throughout the entire duration of an upload. The total amount of
data transferred for a similar experiment did not change. We conjecture that
these are due to improvements in the iPhone baseband software which allow
more eﬃcient buﬀering of data, eliminating the burstiness of the traﬃc egressing
the device. Further upload experiments with the laptop show that it is able to
transfer data at twice the rate of the iPhone. These results suggest hardware
limitations on the iPhone and/or an artiﬁcial software limitation placed on the
device5.
One of the side observations from our experiments that impact the mobile
client throughput is that residential Internet service rates are much higher than
shown in [7]. Upon further investigation, we discovered that Verizon FIOS6 has
recently become available in this area and our experiments show that some
homes have upgraded to this higher level of service. This is hopeful for utilizing
opportunistic communications since more data can be transferred during these
very short contact opportunities. It is also important to note that during these
experiments, the full potential of the Wi-Fi AP was not reached and instead
was limited to the rate of the back-haul link the AP was connected to. Even
though the cost of higher throughput links are dropping in price for residential
service plans, aﬀordable service provider rates are still well below the available
wireless rates of 802.11. This will always place the bottleneck for this type of
communication at the back-haul link to the Internet7.
4 Related Work
This work compares two dominant access technologies, namely 3G and Wi-Fi,
in the wild. Despite many works related to the performance of 3G and Wi-Fi
networks, this is the ﬁrst work to publish a side-by-side comparison while in
motion. This work highlights the potential of Wi-Fi as a contender for high
throughput in-motion communication.
The performance of communicating with stationary access points has been
studied in a variety of diﬀerent scenarios. There have been experiments on a
high speed Autobahn[14], in the Californian desert[5], and on an infrequently
travelled road in Canada[6] where the environment and test parameters were

carefully controlled. These works showed that a signiﬁcant amount of data can
be transferred while moving by access points along the road.
The authors of [3] took this idea into the wild and reported on 290 drive-
hours in urban environments and found the median connection duration to be
13 seconds. This ﬁnding is very promising for in-motion communications. This
could potentially allow large amounts of data to be transferred over currently
under-utilized links without the use of expensive 3G connections.
Previous work investigating performance of HSDPA (High Speed Data Packet
Access), and CDMA 1x EV-DO (Code Division, Multiple Access, Evolution-
Data Optimized) networks show similar ﬁndings with variability in these data
networks[10,12,8]. We also see this behavior in our experiments run on a HSDPA
network.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we perform a comparison of two popular wireless access tech-
nologies, namely 3G and Wi-Fi. 3G provides continuous connectivity with low
data rates and relatively high cost while Wi-Fi is intermittent with high bursts
of data and comes for free when they are open. We experimentally show that
with default AP selection techniques, oﬀ-the-shelf equipment, and no external
antennae, we are able to opportunistically connect to open or community Wi-Fi
APs (incurring no cost to the user) in an urban area and transfer signiﬁcant
amounts of data at walking and driving speeds. Intermittent Wi-Fi connectivity
in an urban area can yield equivalent or greater throughput than what can be
achieved using an “always-connected” 3G network.
Wi-Fi could be easily modiﬁed to increase the number of successful opportu-
nities. (1) Reduce connection setup time with APs, especially with community
networks like FON that have a lengthy authentication process. (2) Clients could
take advantage of Wi-Fi maps and real time location updates in order to choose
which APs will provide the most beneﬁt to the in-motion user[13]. Finally, Wi-
Fi is bottlenecked by the ISP link and (3) caching data on the AP (both for
upload and download) would eliminate the Internet back-haul link bottleneck.
We are currently testing an improved in-motion Wi-Fi architecture that exhibits
signiﬁcantly higher transfer rates than 3G at all speeds.
