(right), nickel silver pins from a Mul-T-Lock telescoping pin-tumbler are used. Marks are present, but 
much lighter than in our normal examples.
For the attacker, it is difficult to not touch the sides of pins. This can happen during raking as well as 
single-pin picking. Marks left on the sides of pins are quite noticeable and not as prone to wear and those 
in the center of the pin. In the photo (left), light scratches at varied angles are visible.
In the case of low-high pinning combinations it is even harder to lift pins without touching other pins. In 
this photo (center), several long scratches travel up the side of the pin. Interestingly, we may be able to 
measure the length of scratches to determine if the attacker raised the adjacent pin high enough.
Like the bottoms of the pins, the sides can tell a great deal about the skill level of the attacker. In this 
photo (right), gouges on the sides of the keys are rather deep, caused by extreme force being used on both 
the tension and picking tools. With this much material removed, it may be possible to identify pin 
material on a suspect's possessions.
Inside the plug we also expect to find various forensic evidence. In this photo (left), the plug walls have 
scratches are various angles that are inconsistent with the use of a key.
The top of the keyway is a great area for forensic evidence because a properly cut key will never touch 
here. Of course, pin-tumblers never touch here either, as this are is between pin chambers. For these 
reasons we consider this a “virgin” area where any tool marks found are indicative of something 
suspicious. In this photo (center), light scratching on the top of the keyway is visible.
Marks can also be found higher on the plug walls, near the pin chambers and internal warding. In this 
photo (right), a large mark is found on an internal ward (between pin chambers). From the shape, angle, 
and size of the mark we can rule out a key as the culprit. If a key did do this, it would likely be present on 
other wards inside the lock, too.
Tensions tools used in lockpicking also leave identifiable forensic evidence. When we take the plug apart, 
we can usually find light scratching and scuffing at the front of the keyway. Marks can be at the top or the 
bottom of the plug, depending on the tension preferences of the attacker, and how clear they are may help 
us determine their skill level. In the photo (left), light scratching and a definitive tension tool mark (the 
line) are visible.
Light tension is preferred when pick locks with security pins or other high security features. Often only a 
feather touch is needed to pick a lock, though excessive tension is a beginner mistake. In this photo 
(center) light scratches are visible, as well as the final resting position of the tool (the clearest mark). The 
light scratches are usually caused by having to fiddle with the tension tool to get it seated properly.
In addition to the pins and plug we can look at the cam of the lock. While evidence on the cam is not 
always available, it does help indicate the skill level of an attacker. At many locksport events the cams are 
removed and you'll notice people with the pick sticking out the back of the lock. When mounted, they are 
hitting the cam instead, creating a good deal of forensic evidence. In this photo (right), excessive 
scratching on the cam indicates a low-skill attacker.
Pick Guns
Pick guns are a covert entry tool used to pick pin-tumbler based locks. Pick guns have manual and 
electric variants, each with their own type of forensic evidence. Both work to rapidly separate pin pairs at 
the shear-line to allow the plug to rotate. Pick guns are similar in function to bump keys.
Manual pick guns are spring-loaded tools that resemble a toy gun with a lockpick attached to the front. 
The lockpick is interchangeable, and referred to as the "needle." To open the lock, the needle is inserted 
in the lock and placed under all pin stacks. As with lockpicking, a separate tension tool is used to apply 
tension and rotate the plug. Light tension is applied to the tension tool and the trigger of the pick gun is 
fired. According to physics, the kinetic energy transfers from bottom pin to top pin, causing the top pins 
to "jump" in their chambers. If all top pins jump above the shear-line at the same time, the plug can be 
rotated to unlock the lock.
Electric and vibrational pick guns work on a similar principle, but instead oscillate the needle back and 
forth, causing it to vibrate. The tool is controlled to get the resonating frequency of the needle at the right 
point so that top pins jump above the shear-line. In the case of vibrational or electric pick guns, we will 
see considerably more evidence on the plug walls because the device is constantly moving.
Forensic Evidence
The striking of the pick gun needle against the bottom pins causes very clear forensic evidence. Unlike 
picking, which causes scratches, the pick gun causes impact marks that, when done many times, begin to 
resemble the spokes of a bicycle along the circumference of the pin. In this photo (left), several impact 
marks are visible.
The marks left by a pick gun are so distinct, compared to the rest of the pin, that is is often possible to 
count them to determine how many times the pick gun was triggered. Each time the needle strikes, the 
bottom pins may rotate slightly, allowing marks to be separate and distinct. In this photo (center), a 
multitude of impact marks along the tip of the pin are visible. 
As with lockpicking, the cam of the lock may have marks on it if the needle of the pick gun is inserted 
too far. Just like the impact marks on the tips of the pins, we can usually count how many times the pick 
gun was used if it touched the game. In this photo (right), many marks are visible on the cam caused by 
repeated use of a pick gun. It is likely that cam material will linked to and found on the pick gun, if it is 
ever recovered.
Key Bumping
Key bumping is a covert entry technique against pin-tumbler locks that uses a specially prepared key to 
"bump" top pins above the shear-line. There are two types of key bumping, pull-out and minimal 
movement, but both produce similar forensic evidence on the bump key and the lock.
To bump a lock, a key is acquired that fits the keyway of the lock. The key is modified so that all cuts are 
at their lowest depths or lower. If done by hand, a key gauge or micrometer can be used to measure the 
key and ensure cuts are deep enough. If done with a key machine, the key may be duplicated from a 
working bump key, or cut by code to the lowest depths.
In the pull-out method, the key is inserted into the lock fully then withdrawn one pin space. In the 
minimal movement method, the key is further modified by removing material from the tip and shoulder 
of the key. The minimal-movement key is inserted completely into the lock. In both cases, light tension is 
applied to the key and a tool (known as a bump hammer) is used to impact the bow of the key, causing 
the key to be forced into the lock. The impact on the key causes kinetic energy to travel from the key to 
the top pins, causing the top pins to momentarily jump. If all top pins jump above the shear-line while 
tension is applied the plug is free to rotate.
Forensic Evidence
The act of key bumping basically slams the key against the bottom pins to allow for kinetic energy to be 
transferred from the key to the top pins. Because they are immobile and absorb the kinetic energy, this 
causes considerable damage to the bottom pins in the form of large dents. In the photo (left), a large dent 
is visible on the pin, inconsistent with normal wear (and lockpicking or pick guns, for that matter).
A bump key that is cut by hand, with a low speed key cutter, or made of a considerably stronger material 
(steel, iron, nickel-silver) than the pins may act as a file as it impacts bottom pins. In this photo, light 
scratches can be seen traveling through the bumping dent. It is possible that marks are distinguishable 
enough and can be linked to a specific bump key, though this is rare.
Bumping is rarely 100% successful, either because bottom pins are bumped above shear line, or top pins 
are not bumped high enough. When this happens the tension applied will misfire, causing one or more top 
pins to bind. This causes light shearing against the bottom of the top pins, visible in this photo (right).
The pin chambers within the plug may also be damaged by bumping. When kinetic energy does not 
properly transfer to the top pin, the pin stack may instead press against the chamber walls (caused by the 
movement of the bump key). Repeated bumping may cause these areas to distort, stretching in various 
directions. In the photo (left), the pin chamber is stressed is distorted in many directions, but mostly to 
the top left.
One of the most noticeable pieces of evidence from key bumping is damage to the face of the lock. This 
is caused by the shoulder of the key impacting the area above and below the keyway. The use of modified 
shoulders may prevent this from happening, commonly done with a glue gun stick (and referred to as a 
glue gun shoulder). In the photo (center), a large dent above the keyway is present, inconsistent with 
normal wear.
In the minimal-movement method, material is removed from the tip and shoulder. This makes the method 
work but also inserts the key far enough that in some cases affects the keyway. This is due to the key 
material getting thicker as it reaches the bow. In the photo (right), this distortion can be seen around the 
edges of the keyway.
Impressioning
Impressioning is a covert entry technique that creates a working key for a target lock. Impressioning has 
two variants: copying, which focuses on making a mold of a working key; manipulation, which focuses 
on using a blank key to manipulate lock components to determine their proper positions. This page will 
focus on manipulation-based impressioning.
Manipulation-based impressioning works by taking a blank key that fits a target lock, applying extreme 
torque to the key (thus binding components), and manipulating the key blank in order to produce marks 
on the key. This is correct for pin-tumbler locks, but the actual process varies for different lock designs. 
The theory behind impressioning is that components at the wrong position will bind and become 
immobile. When the soft brass key contacts the immobile components, a mark should be produced. When 
a component is properly positioned it should no longer bind and thus no longer leave marks. The blank is 
used to gather marks, then filed in those positions. This is repeated until all components are in their 
proper position and the lock opens.
There are variations on the manipulation process that use pressure responsive materials, such as lead, 
tape, or plastic to facilitate the process of impressioning. In these cases we may also find material transfer 
as the soft materials rub against the keyway and inside of the plug.
Forensic Evidence
Because we are forcibly binding bottom pins at or above the shear line we expect to see marks on the pins 
where this occurred. In the photo (left) we can see several marks where the pin was bound against the 
plug in the form of straight lines sheared into the pin. (Note: the scratches to the left are pick marks)
Sometimes, impressioning marks are so clear that we can count the rounds of impressioning (right). If 
marks are far apart the forensic locksmith can also measure the distance between them. This may indicate 
a more skilled attacker if they are using factory depth increments to speed up the impressioning process.
The key blank may be specially prepared for impressioning via manipulation in a variety of ways. One of 
the possibilities is the use of Ultraviolet ink and an ultraviolet light source. This is an interesting 
technique, but as you can see in the photo (left) it leaves ultraviolet ink residue on the face and insides of 
the lock.
When using UV impressioning, UV ink is reapplied each time the blank is filed. In turn, the pins will 
have a large amount of UV reside on them. Notice the obvious key pattern of UV ink across the sides of 
the pin (right). In addition, the UV pen fibers may have been stuck to the key and left behind on the pins 
or the plug walls.
Decoding
Decoding is a general term for a class of covert and surreptitious entry methods, all of which have the 
expressed purpose of decoding the proper position of components in a lock through an examination of the 
key or internal components. Decoding is probably the most ambiguous of all the compromise methods, 
with a wide variety of tools and techniques used.
Decoding does not necessarily create a key for the lock, like impressioning would, nor does it always 
open the lock, as is the case with lockpicking. The power of decoding is the ability to gather information 
that allows the production of working keys for the lock. Decoding is also powerful because many forms 
are surreptitious, thus leave no discernible forensic evidence.
Keys can be directly examined and decoded. Key decoding focuses on identifying the pattern of bitting 
cuts on the key. These can be determined by looking at the code numbers stamped on the key, or through 
direct measurement of each cut with a ruler, micrometer, or caliper. These measurements are used to 
determine the manufacturer's bitting code so that a key may be easily made. Sophisticated locksmithing 
tools are available that will automatically identify the bitting code based on the cuts and keyway profile 
of the key. This is the most basic of decoding methods, and may be problematic with high-security keys 
that have advanced features like sidebars, angled bitting cuts, moving parts, or magnetic/electronic 
components.
Components inside the lock can also be decoded through invasive, manipulative tools. These tools have 
radically different designs, and are generally specific to particular brand or model of lock. Most 
manipulative tools focus on measuring each component to determine: weight, range of movement, shape, 
spacing, and alignment. Many manipulative decoding tools resemble traditional lockpicking tools with 
the addition of a measurement device. Opening the lock via lockpicking is sometimes a pre-requisite to 
decoding the components. Many tools also decode the lock as they pick it. The standard tubular lockpick 
and the Sputnik tool are the most popular examples. Manipulation of combination locks requires no 
invasive tools and is discussed more thoroughly in the Anti-Forensics section.
Disassembly of the lock can also be done to directly measure all internal components. This can be a 
complicated procedure depending on what type of lock it is and how it is installed. This process usually 
requires the lock be compromised first so that the door can be opened. Facilities with lax security 
measures may leave doors unlocked and unguarded, allowing someone to quickly remove, disassemble, 
and decode a lock. Reassembly and re-installation of the lock is equally important, and if done incorrectly 
can cause the lock or proper key to no longer function. In the photo, a hotel safe lock has been (almost) 
completely disassembled. Consider the implications if the safes in the hotel were master keyed, or keyed 
with a predictable pattern.
Visual/optical decoding focuses on observation or surveillance of the 
key or internal components without needing to invasively manipulate 
them. A photograph of a standard key's bitting is enough to decode 
the bitting code. Surveillance may be used against combination locks
