User: I just installed a linux system (Kubuntu) and was wondering if there is a program to make python programs executable for linux.
Assistant: If one want to make executable hello.py
first find the path where python is in your os with : which python
it usually resides under "/usr/bin/python" folder.
at the very first line of hello.py one should add : #!/usr/bin/python
then through linux command chmod 
one should just make it executable like : chmod +x hello.py
and execute with ./hello.py
