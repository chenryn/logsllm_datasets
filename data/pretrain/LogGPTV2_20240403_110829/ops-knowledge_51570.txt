Question: "A new security feature has been implemented to prevent rollback attacks on an Android device. What are the main advantages of binding cryptographic keys to the operating system and patch level of the system image, as seen in Keymaster 2 and 3?"
 "A": "It allows any version of the device to use keys created with a newer or older version of the system image."
 "B": "It prevents an attacker from rolling back a device to a vulnerable version to use keys created with a safer, updated version."
 "C": "It enables keys to be upgraded without invalidating the previous version, allowing for seamless downgrades if necessary."
