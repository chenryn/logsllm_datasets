apm (atom package manager) conflicts with the widely used advanced power
management system on Linux. This has been confirmed on both current versions
of Ubuntu and Debian.
Atom installs "apm" by default into /usr/bin, Advanced Power Management
installs its client, also named "apm" into /usr/bin as well.
Since this is a widely used system, I would suggest that either the Atom
package manager be renamed, or installed into another location so that they do
not conflict.
