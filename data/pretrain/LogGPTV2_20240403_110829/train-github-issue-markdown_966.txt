# Bug report
## Describe the bug
Some Link components stops working in development and production
## To Reproduce
here is a live example https://frontend-e4m1qf1rc.now.sh/ ( **note** : there
is popup ads, i hope you have an adblock)  
1- Click on any news article, if you click on the home Link or the Logo link
in the header, everything works as expected.  
but when clicking on a news article, and refresh the page, and clicking on the
home Link, the Link freezes and it's not routing to the proper route  
2- This also occurs when going directly to a news article from a full
url(domaine.com/news/some-slug)
## Expected behavior
for the Link components to route to the desired route without freezing
## Screenshots
this is how i use Link for those non-working routes:
        home
