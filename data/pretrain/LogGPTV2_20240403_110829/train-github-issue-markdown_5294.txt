I have found that the class "modal-open" is being applied too late to the body
tag. Because of this, there is a brief appearance of double scroll bars. This
is happening in Firefox (22.0) and Chrome (28.0.1500.72 m), both desktop. It
happens in IE10 as well but because of the scroll bars overlaying content it
is not noticeable.
