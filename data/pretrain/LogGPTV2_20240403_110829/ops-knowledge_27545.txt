User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题how to re-direct from http(s)://(www.)example.com to https://example.com using Nginx? Just as the title states.

I found another helpful Q/A, but it does not show how to do it correctly in Nginx settings, I mean the parameters. He might mean that https://exmaple.com should have a valid handshake before being re-direct to https://www.example.com .  In my scenario https://www.example.com works great, but https:example.com can not be re-direct to https://www.example.com.

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;
    rewrite ^ https://example.com$request_uri? permanent;
}

server {
    listen 443;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl on;
    # some other settings, correctly

}


But, it when browsing http://example.com it is redirected to https://example.com but it shows in chrome 

This site can’t be reached 
example.com unexpectedly closed the connection.
ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED```


I want redirect all to https://example.com, how ?

--updated--

the /var/log/nginx/access.log shows

"GET / HTTP/2.0" 301 216 "-" 


no error in /var/log/nginx/error.log

Many thanks!!!

Assistant: So you want to redirect all traffic to https://www.example.com?

I think you're missing the ssl directive in listen 443 ssl;

See sample below

Main Config with HTTPS - www.example.com

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name www.example.com;
    ssl_certificate /path/ssl.crt
    other ssl config....
}


Redirect HTTPS naked domain to WWW

server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name example.com;
        return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
    }


Redirect all HTTP

server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
    }
