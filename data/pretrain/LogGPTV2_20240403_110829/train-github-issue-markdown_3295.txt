Currently, the `numpy.random.multivariate_normal` function utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) via `numpy.dual.svd` on the provided covariance matrix to generate samples. This method allows for the use of positive semi-definite covariance matrices. However, the SVD approach is not unique because the singular vectors are not guaranteed to be unique. For example, both
\[ \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \]
and
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]
can be valid sets of singular vectors for a 2x2 identity matrix.

An alternative approach is to use Cholesky decomposition, which results in a unique decomposition. However, this method is limited to positive definite matrices. To address this, we can consider using a Cholesky decomposition with complete pivoting, as described in the LAPACK documentation:
[Cholesky Decomposition with Complete Pivoting](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/da/dba/group__double_o_t_h_e_rcomputational_ga31cdc13a7f4ad687f4aefebff870e1cc.html)

This approach offers the advantages of both methods: it works with positive semi-definite matrices and provides a unique decomposition, to the best of my knowledge.
