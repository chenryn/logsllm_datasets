Currently, `numpy.random.multivariate_normal` makes use of SVD decomposition,
`numpy.dual.svd`, on the provided covariance matrix to perform the sampling.
This approach allows the use of positive semi-definite covariance matrix.
However, it is not unique as the singular vectors are not guaranteed to be. In
fact,
    [[-1, 0],
     [0,  -1]]
and
    [[1, 0],
     [0,  1]]
can be the singular-vectors of a 2-by-2 identity matrix.
A Cholesky decomposition instead would result in an unique decomposition with
the down side of only working on positive definite matrices. We could use
instead a Cholesky decomposition with complete pivoting:

It provides both advantages: works on positive semi-definite matrices and are
unique (as far as I know).
Any thoughts?
