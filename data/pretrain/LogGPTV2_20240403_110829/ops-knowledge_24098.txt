User: I made myself a little module which I happen to use quite a lot. Whenever I need it I simply copy it to the folder in which I want to use it. Since I am lazy I wanted to install it so that I can call it from anywhere, even the interactive prompt. So I read a bit about installing here, and concluded I needed to copy the file over to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages. That however, doesn't seem to do anything.
Does anybody know where I need to copy my module for it to work system wide?
Assistant: You could also have a folder that contains all your global modules e.g. my_modules/ then localize the site-packages/ folder of the Python version your are using (you will find it easily by using this command: python -m site). Now, cd to this folder and create a custom file with a .pth extension. In this file, add the absolute path to the folder that contains all the modules you want to make available system wide and save it. Your module should be available now
