When maximized and then exited, it saves the sizes and not the maximization.
And it ends up opening un-maximized, but with the maximized sizes.
**Correct behaviour should be:** If maximized, use the value of last resize
before maximization, but also flag the maximization.
On Windows, resizing due to Aero-Snap behaviors should be not be saved, and
ignored. Similar behavior to maximization has to be used for correctness.
