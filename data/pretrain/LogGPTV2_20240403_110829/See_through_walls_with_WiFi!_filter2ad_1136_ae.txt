Figure 8—Tracking human motion with Wi-Vi. The ﬁgures show output traces with a different number of humans after processing with the smoothed
MUSIC algorithm. They plot A![θ, n] where θ is the angle in [−90, 90] is plotted on the y-axis and time is on the x-axis. (a) shows traces for one human; (b)
for two humans; and (c) for three humans moving behind the wall of a closed room.
conﬁned space, a person that moves towards Wi-Vi will eventually
have to move away or stop. Second, the brightness of the line typ-
ically indicates distance. Note that for the same spatial angle, one
may be close or far from Wi-Vi. Hence, some large angles appear
bright or dim depending on the part of the trace we look at.
A third observation is that as the number of humans increases,
it becomes harder to separate them. The problem is that the curved
lines are fuzzy both due to residual noise and the fact that a human
can move his body parts differently as he moves. For example, wav-
ing while moving makes the lines signiﬁcantly fuzzier as in 8(a3).
Finally, our experiments are conducted in multipath-rich indoor
environments. Thus, the results in Fig. 8 show that Wi-Vi works
in the presence of multipath effects. This is because the direct path
from a moving human to Wi-Vi is much stronger than indirect paths
which bounce off the internal walls of the room. A moving human
acts like a large antenna. In order to block the direct path, the human
body must be obstructed by a pillar or a large piece of furniture, and
stay obstructed for the duration of Wi-Vi’s measurements.12
12We note that the experiments in this paper were performed in scenarios
where the separator is homogeneous wall (e.g., concrete, wooden, glass,
etc.). There might be scenarios in which the separator is non-homogeneous
(e.g., the ﬁeld of view of Wi-Vi’s directional antenna captures a side of
a wall and a glass window), which may cause some indirect paths to be
stronger than the direct path. In this case, Wi-Vi will still detect a moving
7.4 Automatic Detection of Moving Humans
We are interested in evaluating whether Wi-Vi can use the spa-
tial variance described in §5.2 to automate the detection of moving
humans. As in the previous section, we run our experiments in the
same conference rooms described in §7.3. Again, we position Wi-
Vi such that it faces a wall that has neither a door nor a window.
For each of our experiments, we ask a number of humans between
0 and 3 from our volunteers to enter the room and move at will.
Each experiment lasts for 25 seconds excluding the time required
for iterative nulling. We perform each experiment with a different
subset of subjects, and conduct a total of 80 experiments, with equal
number of experiments spanning the cases of 0, 1, 2, and 3 moving
humans. We process the collected traces ofﬂine and compute the
spatial variance as described in §5.2.
Fig. 9 shows the CDFs (cumulative distribution functions) of the
spatial variance for the experiments run with each number of mov-
ing humans: 0, 1, 2, and 3. We observe the following:
• The spatial variance provides a good metric for distinguishing the
number of moving humans. In particular, the variance increases
as the number of humans involved in each experiment increases.
This is also evident from the ﬁgures in 8, where one can visually
object but may have errors in tracking the angle of the movement or predict-
ing the number of moving humans.

see that the spatial variance is higher with more moving bodies
in the room.
• Interestingly, the separation between successive CDFs decreases
as the number of humans increases. In particular, the separation
is larger between the CDFs of no humans and one human, than
between the CDFs of one human and two humans. The separa-
tion is the least between the CDFs of 2 humans and 3. To under-
stand this behavior, recall that because the room has a conﬁned
space, as the number of people increases, the freedom of move-
ment decreases. Hence, adding a human to a congested space is
expected to add less spatial variance than adding her to a less
congested space where she has more freedom to move.
Next, we would like to automate the thresholds for distinguish-
ing 0, 1, 2, and 3 moving humans. To do so, we divide the data into
a training set and a testing set. To ensure that Wi-Vi can generalize
across environments, we ensure that the training examples are all
conducted in one conference room, while the testing examples are
conducted in another conference room (Recall that the two rooms
have different sizes). We use the training set to learn the thresholds
to separate the spatial variances corresponding to 0, 1, 2, and 3 hu-
mans. We then use these thresholds to classify the experiments in
the testing set. Finally, we perform cross-validation, i.e., we repeat
the same procedure after switching the training and testing sets.
Table 2 shows the result of the classiﬁcation. It shows that Wi-Vi
can identify whether there is 0 or 1 person in a room with 100%
accuracy; this is expected based on the CDFs in Fig. 9. Also, row
3 shows that two humans are never confused with 0 or 1. How-
ever, Wi-Vi confused 2 humans with 3 humans in 15% of the trials,
whereas it accurately identiﬁed their number in 85% of the cases.
7.5 Gesture Decoding
Next, we evaluate Wi-Vi’s ability to decode the bits associated
with the gestures in §6. In each experiment, a human is asked to
stand at a particular distance from the wall that separates the room
from our device, and perform the two gestures corresponding to
bit ‘0’ and bit ‘1’. Each human took steps at a length they found
comfortable. Typical step sizes were 2-3 feet. The experiments are
repeated at various distances in the range [1m, 9m]. All experi-
ments are conducted in the same conference rooms described above
and under the same experimental conditions. One of our conference

Figure 10—Accuracy of Gesture Decoding as a Function of Distance.
The ﬁgure shows the fraction of experiments in which Wi-Vi correctly de-
coded the bit associated with the performed gesture at different distances
separating the subject from the wall. Note that Wi-Vi decodes a gesture only
when its SNR is greater than 3dB; this explains the sharp cutoff between 8
and 9 meters.
rooms is only 7m wide, whereas the other is 11m wide. Hence, the
experiments with distances larger than 6 meters are conducted in
the larger conference room, whereas for all distances less than or
equal 6 meters, our experiments included trials from both rooms.
The obtained traces are processed using the matched ﬁlter and de-
coding algorithm described in §6.2.
Fig. 10 plots the fraction of time the gestures were decoded cor-
rectly as a function of the distance from the wall separating Wi-Vi
from the closed room. We note the following observations:
• Wi-Vi correctly decoded the performed gestures at all distances
less than or equal to 5m. It identiﬁed 93.75% of the gestures per-
formed at distances between 6m and 7m. At 8m, the performance
started degrading, leading to correct identiﬁcation of only 75% of
the gestures. Finally, Wi-Vi could not identify any of the gestures
when the person was standing 9m away from the wall.
• It is important to note that, in our experiments, Wi-Vi never mis-
took a ‘0’ bit for a ‘1’ bit or the inverse. When it failed to decode
a bit, it was because it could not register enough energy to detect
the gesture from the noise. This means that Wi-Vi ’s errors are
erasure errors as opposed to standard bit errors.
• We measured the time it took the different subjects to perform a
one bit gesture. Averaged over all traces, our subjects took 2.2s
to perform a gesture, with a standard deviation of 0.4s.
To gain further insight into Wi-Vi’s gesture decoding, Fig. 11
plots the CDFs of the SNRs of the ‘0’ gesture and the ‘1’ gesture,
across all the experiments. Interestingly, the gesture associated with
a ‘0’ bit has a higher SNR than the gesture associated with a ‘1’ bit.
This is due to two reasons: First, the ‘0’ gesture involves a step for-
ward followed by a step backward, whereas the ‘1’ gesture requires
the human to ﬁrst step backward then forward. Hence, for the same
starting point, the human is on average closer to Wi-Vi while per-
forming the ‘0’ gesture, which results in an increase in the received
power. Second, taking a step backward is naturally harder for hu-
mans; hence, they tend to take smaller steps in the ‘1’ gesture. This
observation is visually evident in Fig. 5 where a ‘0’ gesture has a
higher power (red) than the ‘1’ gesture.
We note that the main factor limiting gesture decodability with
increased distance is the low transmit power of USRPs. The linear
transmit power range for USRPs is around 20 mW (i.e., beyond this
power the signal starts being clipped), whereas Wi-Fi’s power limit
is 100mW. Hence, one would expect that with better hardware, Wi-
Vi can have a higher decoding range.
7.6 The Effect of Building Material
Finally, we evaluate Wi-Vi’s performance with different building
materials. Thus, in addition to the two conference rooms described
