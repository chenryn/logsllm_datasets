To those well-versed in the Eclipse IDE and the PyDev plugin, I would greatly appreciate your technical support.

I am currently developing a Python module that requires command-line arguments using the `sys.argv` function. However, when I attempt to run the program with the command `E:\...\src>program.py arg1 arg2`, the expected output is not displayed. Instead, a new command line prompt (E:\...\src>) appears, and the Eclipse IDE window briefly flashes orange without executing any code from my Python module. Additionally, if I close Eclipse and try to run `program.py` directly, it simply reopens Eclipse and opens my program in a new tab.

This issue is particularly puzzling because just last week, the same setup was working perfectly for another program that also used `sys.argv` to accept command-line arguments. I am seeking advice on whether there are any settings or updates that may have caused this problem. Has anyone else encountered and resolved a similar issue? I have already verified that my PATH variable is correctly set, so that is not the source of the problem.

Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I have since found the solution to my own question, as mentioned in a previous comment. I was only able to post this answer after waiting due to the restrictions on new Stack Overflow accounts.
