Question: When initializing a Mac with Apple silicon, several security keys and certificates are generated and managed. Suppose you are configuring a new Mac device and are in the process of setting up the secure boot environment. What are the correct steps and components involved in this initialization process?
"A": "The Secure Enclave generates a User Identity Key (UIK) which is then certified for Activation Lock, including constraints for validation-time enforcement on the LocalPolicy.",
"B": "A LocalPolicy file is signed by the Basic Attestation Authority (BAA) server before being sent back to the device.",
"C": "During the creation of a LocalPolicy, RemotePolicy constraints are applied to ensure the policy contains the ECID of the Mac and the specific Remote Policy Nonce Hash (rpnh).",
"D": "The Owner Identity Key (OIK) is generated and stored securely on the BAA server to ensure it can be accessed during recoveryOS boot operations."
