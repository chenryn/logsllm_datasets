which affects the user experience.
3. Temporal Features. The CV provider can try to change the
number of blocked elements by making the advertising DOM
structure simpler, as shown in Listing 3, or more complex by
using unnecessary DOM elements. This effectively reduces the
number of blocked elements. However, page source features
can still detect circumvention by analyzing ad positions rather
than the DOM structure. Another possible exploit is to delay
the triggering of circumvention (e.g. after the 12 second period)
so that CV-INSPECTOR does not detect the number of blocked
events. However, this goes against the main objective of ads,
which is to quickly display ads to the user before the user
leaves the page. This delaying approach would negatively

the revenue that
4. Page Source Features. To evade the features related to
the number of iframes and images in ad positions, a CV
provider can change the location of ads when circumvention
is employed. For example, if ads were original shown on the
right side bar for the “No Adblocker” case, then the ads can
be moved to left side bar. However, this increases the overhead
for the publisher to integrate with CV providers, as the new ad
locations must be seamlessly incorporated into individualized
templates of different sites. In the above example, the left
side bar must make sense within the publisher’s template
to be a feasible ad location. Also recall from Fig. 1(b) that
the publisher must still fetch for new ad content. Thus, CV-
INSPECTOR can still capture this circumvention characteristic
through our web requests features.
Takeaways. Overall, CV-INSPECTOR raises the bar in the
arms race with CV providers, by extracting diverse features
that collectively capture the fundamental behavior of CV

providers through differential analysis. In order to evade dif-
ferential analysis, CV providers would have to make the site’s
behavior “With Adblocker” similar to that of “No Adblocker.”
However, this either limits ad re-injection to simple static ads
(often not proﬁtable for publishers) or requires that CV ser-
vices are triggered for all users (using adblockers or otherwise)
resulting in higher cost for the publisher.
G. Summary
temporal
In this section, we presented the design and implementation
of CV-INSPECTOR. Speciﬁcally, it collects data from web
requests, DOM mutations,
information (including
blocked events caused by ABP), page source, and screenshots.
Then, it employs differential analysis designed uniquely to
capture circumvention activity, and we extract intuitive features
speciﬁcally designed for capturing circumvention. We also
provide an iterative methodology for obtaining ground truth,
that can speed up the process while discovering more positive
labels. We trained and evaluated a Random Forest classiﬁer
using this GT data set, and demonstrated that it achieves an
accuracy of 93% in detecting sites that employ CV providers.
We further ﬁnd that web request features relating to path
entropy is the most effective feature. By capturing the essential
characteristics of circumvention, we conclude that it would
be difﬁcult for CV providers to evade both CV-INSPECTOR
and ﬁlter rules without incurring costs, i.e., not being able to
show proﬁtable ads to the users and overhead of activating
circumvention for all users. Next, we apply and evaluate CV-
INSPECTOR in real world settings.
V. CV-INSPECTOR: IN THE WILD DEPLOYMENT
We employ CV-INSPECTOR in two real world scenarios.
First, in Sec. V-A, we employ CV-INSPECTOR on the popular
Tranco-20K sites to discover sites that circumvent adblockers,
and are possibly unknown. Second, in Sec. V-B, we use CV-
INSPECTOR to monitor the effectiveness of ACVL on sites
that are well-known to circumvent adblockers, and which
are continuously monitored by ﬁlter list curators. For the
evaluation of monitoring, we use two data sets: our own GTP
data set and Adblock Plus Monitoring data set provided by
ABP. More details are provided in the respective sections and
the data sets are detailed in Sec. IV-A4 and Table II.
A. Discovering Circumvention in the Wild
1) In the Wild Performance: We ﬁrst conduct a large-scale
analysis of deploying CV-INSPECTOR in the wild. Our goal
is to facilitate the crowdsourcing effort by the adblocking
community to discover sites that successfully circumvent ad-
blockers. To that end, we apply CV-INSPECTOR on the popular
Tranco-20K sites, which contains 29.3K pages with sub-pages.
Recall that the Tranco top-2K sites were used as candidates for

data set vs. being correct in the prediction.
labeling (CL), which eventually affected the training set (GT)
for our CV-INSPECTOR’s classiﬁer. Therefore, we exclude it
from the in the wild evaluation because we want to keep the
Tranco sites used for training (top-2K) and testing (top 2k-
20K) disjoint. We follow our earlier data collection approach,
described in Fig. 6, to crawl these URLs. As shown in Table V,
CV-INSPECTOR detects 91 sites as “CV” and the remaining
29,248 sites as “No CV.” We validate the 91 “CV” sites and
a random sample (380) of “No CV” sites. CV-INSPECTOR
achieves 87% precision when identifying sites with successful
CV and 91% for the opposite case. Our evaluation in Table V
shows that CV-INSPECTOR generalizes well in the wild, with
similar precision when compared to Table IV.
The Random Forests classiﬁer picks the likeliest class,
which in binary classiﬁcation is by default the class with
probability above 0.5. This is the case in the results presented
in Tables V, VII, and VIII in this section. CV-INSPECTOR
can be applied to different use cases (e.g. discovery or mon-
itoring of sites employing circumvention) that value different
metrics (e.g. recall vs. precision, respectively). Since there is
no universally applicable operating point, instead of tuning
parameters to overﬁt a particular use case and data set, we
discuss the trade-offs involved and leave it up to the users
of CV-INSPECTOR to decide upon the operating point that
matches their goals.
Trade-offs. Fig. 12 reports how CV-INSPECTOR navigates
the trade-off between discovering more sites that successfully
circumvent adblockers and precision, when applied to the
Tranco-20K data set. For instance, a conﬁdence level threshold
of 0.6 achieves a precision of 98% with only one FP. This
would be an attractive option to minimize human supervision
for monitoring sites of interest. However, if discovering sites
that use circumvention is more important, then lowering the
threshold below 0.5 would ﬁnd more sites at the expense of
increasing human efforts to deal with FPs. The operating point
can be tweaked to optimize various objectives of interest.
As a concrete example, Fig. 13(a) depicts how CV-
INSPECTOR can navigate the trade-off between true positive
rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). The suitable classiﬁer
(b) Precision vs. Recall
Fig. 13. Trade-offs on the Tranco-20K Data Set. (a) Within our ROC curve,
we can maximize Youden’s J index if we value high true positive rate (TPR)
with low false positive rate (FPR) for the purpose of discovering sites with
successful circumvention. The threshold following this criteria is 0.41, which
corresponds to a TPR of 0.85 and FPR of 0.11. (b) Within our precision-recall
curve, we can ﬁnd the threshold that corresponds to the optimal F1-score for
positive labels. The threshold following this criteria is 0.45, which achieves
an F1-score of 0.79.
threshold depends on the use case. For example, if one wants
to optimize for TPR (i.e., recall) while keeping the FPR low,
one metric to maximize is Youden’s J index, which leads to
a threshold of 0.41 with corresponding TPR of 0.85 and FPR
of 0.11. This is the right objective when we are interested in
discovering more sites that employ circumvention at the risk
of some additional false positives.
Another even more relevant
trade-off in our case is
precision vs. recall, depicted on Fig. 13(b). We ﬁnd that a
threshold of 0.45 maximizes the F1-score for positive labels,
achieving a F1-score of 0.79. It is not surprising that this value
is close but below 0.5, because our Tranco-20K data set is
imbalanced as shown in Table V. As discussed in Sec. IV-D,
positive labels are rare when compared to negative labels,
which makes the classiﬁer less sensitive to the minority class.
To compensate for this, one would decrease the threshold to
improve recall for positive labels at the expense of precision.
2) Circumvention Providers: We now analyze the break-
down of different circumvention providers. Note that CV-
INSPECTOR is not designed to distinguish between different
circumvention providers. Therefore, we rely on other heuristics
to detect speciﬁc CV providers.
Unique Keywords for CV Providers. We curate keywords
that are indicative of speciﬁc CV providers through a careful
manual inspection of known circumvention sites in our GT data
set. Intuitively, to discover keywords, we ﬁrst search using the
name of the providers within our collected data of web requests
(e.g., URLs and HTTP request/response headers) and page
source ﬁles (e.g., HTML ﬁles consisting of HTML, inline CSS,
and inline JS). Notably, we discover that some CV providers,
like ExoClick, AdDefend, and Adthrive, do not attempt to hide
