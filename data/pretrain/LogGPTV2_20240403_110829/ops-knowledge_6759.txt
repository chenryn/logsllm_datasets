User: When a script is executed with pythonw it will not open a console.
Is there a way to capture the stdout of such a script by keeping the usage of pythonw?
Note, I am looking for a solution that does not require the modification of the script (I know that I can use logging)
Update: pythonw script.py >somefile seems to work. How can I redirect it to console?
Assistant: It was obvious: pythonw script.py|more
