Malware increasing on “App Stores” 
Chris Di Bona from Google, November 2011: 
”virus companies are playing on your fears to try to sell you bs protection 
software for Android, RIM and IOS. They are charlatans and scammers. IF 
you work for a company selling virus protection for android, rim or IOS 
you should be ashamed of yourself.” 
“The barriers to spreading such a program from phone to phone are large 
and difficult enough to traverse when you have legitimate access to the 
phone, but this isn’t independence day, a virus that might work on 
one device won’t magically spread to the other.” 
All the major vendors have app markets, and all the major vendors have 
apps that do bad things, are discovered, and are dropped from the 
markets.

Where’s the challenge? 
The Inside of an APK File 
• AndroidManifest.xml contains 
the meta information; 
– Package name & version  
– Activities  
– Services 
• classes.dex contains all the 
code for Dalvik Virtual Machine. 
• META-INF/ contains the 
certificate and signature.  
APK are signed zip files 
The AndroidManifest File 
Google’s Binary xml File 
• Format is not documented 
• Tools for reading Binary xml files are readily 
available 
• Tools for writing Binary xml files are limited 
The Dex File  
Dalvik Executable Format 
• Format is well documented  
• Many modification tools available 
– asmdex  
– smali/baksmali  
– Dexmaker 
• APKs can only use 16 to 32MB of memory so a 
separate Dalvik VM should be started 
The META-INF/ Folder 
Certificate & Signature 
•
Format is well documented 
•
Many creation tools available 
• jarsigner from JDK 
• signapk from Android Source 
•
Minor modifications must be done to run on 
an Android device
