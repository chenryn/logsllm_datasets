[ics](https://icspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a pythonic iCalendar
library. Its goals are to read and write ics data in
a developer-friendly way.
# Installation
Install using pip:
```bash
pip install ics
```
# Usage
!!! warning "`ics` will delete all data that it doesn't understand. Maybe it's better for your case to build a parse for ics."
## Import a calendar from a file
```python
file = '/tmp/event.ics'
from ics import Calendar
with open(file, 'r') as fd:
    calendar = Calendar(fd.read())
# 
calendar.events
# {,
# ,
#  ...}
event = list(calendar.timeline)[0]
```
## Export a Calendar to a file
```python
with open('my.ics', 'w') as f:
    f.writelines(calendar.serialize_iter())
# And it's done !
# iCalendar-formatted data is also available in a string
calendar.serialize()
# 'BEGIN:VCALENDAR\nPRODID:...
```
