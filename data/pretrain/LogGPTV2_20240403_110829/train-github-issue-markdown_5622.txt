So here's a weird one. I have a Docker container based on debian:stable where
I install python3 and python3-pip, and when trying to install requests from a
requirements.txt file I get the following:
    Downloading/unpacking requests (from -r /tmp/requirements/xxx.txt (line 2))
      Running setup.py egg_info for package requests
    Exception:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip/basecommand.py", line 104, in main
        status = self.run(options, args)
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip/commands/install.py", line 245, in run
        requirement_set.prepare_files(finder, force_root_egg_info=self.bundle, bundle=self.bundle)

      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip/req.py", line 359, in assert_source_matches_version
        version = self.installed_version
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip/req.py", line 351, in installed_version
        return self.pkg_info()['version']
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip/req.py", line 318, in pkg_info
        data = self.egg_info_data('PKG-INFO')
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip/req.py", line 261, in egg_info_data
        data = fp.read()
      File "/usr/lib/python3.2/encodings/ascii.py", line 26, in decode
        return codecs.ascii_decode(input, self.errors)[0]
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 8161: ordinal not in range(128)
However, when I run `pip-3.2 install requests` directly, it works fine.  
I honestly have no idea where even to start on debugging this.
