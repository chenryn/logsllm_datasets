I understand you are encountering issues when trying to activate a virtual environment in your Django project on a Windows OS. The error message, `'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file`, suggests that the `source` command, which is specific to Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux and macOS), is being used incorrectly on a Windows system. 

Let's clarify and correct the process for activating a virtual environment in a Windows environment:

1. **Create the Virtual Environment:**
   You have already created the virtual environment using:
   ```sh
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
   ```
   Note: The `--no-site-packages` flag is deprecated and no longer needed as it is now the default behavior.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   On Windows, you should use the `activate` script located in the `Scripts` directory of your virtual environment. The correct command is:
   ```sh
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Verify Activation:**
   After running the above command, your command prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active. It will look something like this:
   ```sh
   (venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>
   ```

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**
   When you are done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply typing:
   ```sh
   (venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>deactivate
   ```

### Additional Notes:
- **Python Version:** You mentioned Python 7, but please note that the latest version of Python as of my last update is Python 3.9. Ensure you are using a supported version of Python.
- **Virtualenv Version:** You mentioned using virtualenv 2.2.x, which is quite old. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of `virtualenv` or using `venv`, which is included with Python 3.3 and later.

### Example of Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment:
```sh
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>python -m venv venv

c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>venv\Scripts\activate

(venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>
```

If you continue to experience issues, please ensure that your system's PATH environment variable includes the directory where Python is installed. This can be checked and modified through the System Properties in Windows.
