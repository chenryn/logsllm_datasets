`scrollToHash` doesn't work as expected.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I would expect the anchor to be scrolled to.
## Current Behavior
Anchor is scrolled to correctly, but quickly after the scroll position is
reset to the top of the page.  
Increasing the setTimeout value fixes the issue but seems brittle.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Add anchor to url
  2. Visit page
