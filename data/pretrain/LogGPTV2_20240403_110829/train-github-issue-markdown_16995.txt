# Bug report
## Describe the bug
Whenever I do `npm run build` it doesn't remove the old files from previous
builds inside the .next folder. This eventually causes the
`.next/server/static/` folder to have a lot of folders of the old builds. Is
this intended?
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. `npm run build`
  2. Open `.next/server/static`
  3. `npm run build` multiple times
  4. New folders are generated (with the respective BUILD_ID), but the old folders for the previous builds aren't deleted.
  5. `npm run dev`
  6. `.next` is rebuilt from the ground up, which deletes old builds
  7. But if you never `npm run dev`, the old build folders stay there. Which is usually the case for projects in production servers
## Expected behavior
Old build folders should be deleted right? (on development environments it's
okay since `npm run dev` resets it, but on production environments these
folders will start to pile up)
I just checked one of my servers and saw a bunch of these unnecessary folders.
In this server i would `git pull`, `npm run build && pm2 restart [pm2 name]`.
So it eventually accumulated a bunch of these
## Screenshots
All the previous builds are still in the folder, `XB7kfZi8MyFj3pO7k5iSZ` is
the current build as seen in the `BUILD_ID` file
