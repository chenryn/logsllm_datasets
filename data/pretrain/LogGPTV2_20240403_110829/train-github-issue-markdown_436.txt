I am interested in implementing a new connector for Superset to add MongoDB
support, and would like to know if others have started similar work too so as
to avoid duplicate effort.
### Inspiration
@priyankajuyal I think there're 3 methods to support mongodb in superset:
  * Implement a mongodb in sqlalchemy, this requires a lot of work and may not be easy to do cause sqlalchemy is a object relational mapper library, while mongodb is not relational.
  * Implement a new connector for superset. Right now superset has two connectors, one is for sqlalchemy, one is for druid, and similar things can be implemented for mongodb, this should be the right choice.
  * Transform mongodb to some relational db, stripe has a deprecated project for this job: https://github.com/stripe/mosql.
