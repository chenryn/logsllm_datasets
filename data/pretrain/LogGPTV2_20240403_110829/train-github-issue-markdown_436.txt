I am interested in developing a new connector for Superset to add support for MongoDB. Before proceeding, I would like to know if anyone else has already started similar work to avoid duplicating efforts.

### Inspiration
@priyankajuyal, I believe there are three potential methods to integrate MongoDB with Superset:

1. **Implement MongoDB Support in SQLAlchemy:**
   - This approach involves creating a MongoDB dialect for SQLAlchemy. However, this could be quite challenging and time-consuming because SQLAlchemy is primarily designed as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for relational databases, while MongoDB is a NoSQL database. The fundamental differences between these two types of databases make this option less feasible.

2. **Develop a New Connector for Superset:**
   - Currently, Superset supports two main connectors: one for SQLAlchemy (which handles relational databases) and another for Druid (a high-performance analytics data store). A similar connector can be developed specifically for MongoDB. This seems to be the most appropriate and practical solution.

3. **Transform MongoDB Data into a Relational Format:**
   - Another method is to transform MongoDB data into a format that can be used by a relational database. Stripe has a deprecated project called `mosql` that performs this transformation: [https://github.com/stripe/mosql](https://github.com/stripe/mosql). However, this approach may introduce additional complexity and overhead.
