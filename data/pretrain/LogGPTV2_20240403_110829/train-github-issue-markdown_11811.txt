by **PI:EMAIL** :
    Similar to issue #6258, but not the same.
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    Try to read a CSV file where the fields are unquoted and one of them begins in something
    that would need lazy quotes, e.g.
    Field1,Field2,"LazyQuotes" Field3,Field4,Field5
    What is the expected output?
    ["Field1", "Field2", "\"LazyQuotes\" Field3",
    "Field4", "Field5"]
    Length 5
    What do you see instead?
    ["Field1", "Field2", "LazyQuotes\"
    Field3,Field4,Field5"]
    Length 3
