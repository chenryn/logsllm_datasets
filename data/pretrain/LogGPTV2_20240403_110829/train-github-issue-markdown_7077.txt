The following combination of `include_role` and `when` condition in one of my
roles results in the error message posted below.
`myrole/tasks/main.yml`:
     ---
     - include_role: name=mydebug
       when: project == "some-project"
Error:
    fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"failed": true, "msg": "The conditional check 'p' failed. The error was: error while evaluating conditional (p): 'p' is undefined\n\nThe error appears to have been in '/opt/ansible/roles/proj-conf/tasks/main.yml': line 2, column 3, but may\nbe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.\n\nThe offending line appears to be:\n\n---\n- include_role: name=mydebug\n  ^ here\n"}
Without the condition, the role runs fine. Any clue what's causing this
behavior?
For information:  
ansible 2.2.0.0
The `mydebug` role is a simple wrapper around the predefined `debug` role.
`mydebug/tasks/main.yml`:
    ---
    - debug:
      msg: "test"
My playbook:
    ---
    - hosts: '{{ target }}'
      roles:
        - { role: myrole, project: '{{ project }}'}
