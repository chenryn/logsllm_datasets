I need to use a `fabfile` to remotely start a program on remote servers, retrieve the results, and run the program in the background to avoid waiting for it to complete. Initially, I attempted to use `os.fork()` to achieve this. When I SSH into the remote server and run the program with `os.fork()`, it works correctly in the background. However, when I use `fabfile`'s `run` or `sudo` commands to start the program remotely, `os.fork()` fails, and the program terminates silently.

To address this, I switched to using `python-daemon` to daemonize the program. For a while, this solution worked perfectly. However, I recently encountered an issue where the program needs to read Python `shelve` dictionaries. With `python-daemon`, the `shelve` dictionaries cannot be loaded correctly, and I am unsure why this is happening.

Has anyone faced a similar issue and found an alternative solution besides `os.fork()` and `python-daemon`?

**Update:**

For those who may come across this post in the future, `python-daemon` can still work. The issue was that the `shelve` dictionaries were being loaded in the parent process. When `python-daemon` spawns a child process, the dictionary handlers are not passed correctly. By ensuring that the `shelve` dictionaries are loaded within the same process, everything works as expected.

Thank you to everyone who provided valuable comments and suggestions on this thread!
