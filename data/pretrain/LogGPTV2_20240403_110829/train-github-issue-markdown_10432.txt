When building an application compiled using babel, lots of developer use the
`runtime` transformer but still requires the polyfills for ES6+ definitions.
The application's package is generally similar to:
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "babel-runtime": "^5.0.0"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "babel": "^5.0.0"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "build": "babel -d lib src"
      }
    }
Unfortunately the polyfills are located at `babel/runtime` which requires the
developer to specify `babel` as dependencies (not a dev one) if he want to use
it. Adding the polyfills to `babel-runtime` would solve this issue.
