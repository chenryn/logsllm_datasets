I want to access the used/generated babel configuration. Especially which
presets includes which plugins exactly.
PS: I get option-manager work, the ONLY problem is that plugins which presets
uses, are anonymous functions. Normally the **key** prop reference to the full
path. Plugins included by presets have a dynamical incrementef name something
with "$"
How this ensures to avoid duplication plugins?  
Is there any way to get some hints of those kind of plugins, so i can list it
in a kind debug output?
