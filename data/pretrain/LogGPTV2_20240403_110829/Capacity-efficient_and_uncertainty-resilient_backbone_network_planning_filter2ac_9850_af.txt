#### Long-Term Capacity Efficiency
Over a period of five years, the projected traffic demand from our production traffic forecaster roughly doubles every two years. Hose-based capacity planning is more efficient in the long run for several reasons:

1. **Relative Capacity Gain**: The relative capacity gain of Hose increases year by year. By 2025, it can save 17.4% capacity compared to Pipe.
2. **Scalability**: While both Pipe and Hose capacity scale faster than traffic growth (to account for failure scenarios), Hose capacity increases at a lower rate. This capacity saving is due to the multiplexing gain from traffic aggregation, as discussed in Section 2.

The advantage of Hose is not immediately apparent because the Hose model has only been in use for a few years. Our current topology is primarily based on Pipe-based planning, and it takes time to transition to a Hose-compliant network. In Figure 14(b), we remove this factor by planning the network from scratch, showing a 7% capacity decrease against the 2021 Pipe result in Figure 14(a). These observations suggest that evolving a network with the Hose model can lead to a more optimized network topology compared to the Pipe model.

#### Cost Savings
While we cannot share proprietary cost values, we approximate the cost benefit of Hose using fiber pair consumption. Figure 15 shows the additional percentage of fiber usage normalized by the baseline. We observe a similar trend to the capacity growth, with the cost advantage becoming more pronounced over time. In four to five years, the savings can be as high as 20%.

#### Optimization Time vs. Accuracy
Table 2 further investigates the results from Figure 14(b) with varying Hose coverage. Even a relatively low coverage of 40% achieves a significant capacity saving of 8.62%. At a high coverage of 83%, the overall computation time is an affordable 1063 minutes (or 17.7 hours). Because the Demand Traffic Matrices (DTMs) are processed iteratively in batches, later batches may already be satisfied by earlier ones. Thus, the computation time per DTM is only a few minutes and further reduces with more DTMs, thanks to the batching effect. This highlights that our solution is scalable and insensitive to DTM selection when the coverage is sufficient.

Figure 16 compares the planned capacity per IP link for different Hose coverage values against the 83% coverage baseline. The planning difference is notable but diminishes as Hose coverage improves. Given the good time scalability of our system, we recommend choosing a high Hose coverage to avoid under-provisioning, such as that achieved by coverage values of 58% and 67%. The capacity saving remains stable when the coverage value exceeds 83%.

#### Capacity Distribution
Figure 17 shows the standard deviation of capacity across all IP links at each site for Year 1 planning (2021 result in Figure 14). Capacity is distributed more uniformly in Hose. For the Hose model, almost 70% of sites have a capacity variance less than 5 Tbps, while the number is only 50% for Pipe. At 80%, Pipe has a variance 1.5 times larger than Hose. The tail of variance for Pipe is also larger than Hose. A more uniform capacity distribution is desirable for resilience against unplanned failures and future scaling, as it allows more Traffic Matrices (TMs) to fit into even link capacities at a site. Hose-based planning adds capacity more uniformly across links due to the varied TMs it considers.

### 7. Operational Experience
We have learned important operational lessons from running Hose-based network planning in production. This section discusses unexpected use cases, system adjustments, and directions for future improvements.

#### 7.1 Disaster Recovery Buffer
"Disaster readiness" is a fundamental aspect of Facebook's infrastructure [22]. Disasters refer to catastrophic events like hurricanes or major fires in data centers (DCs). Facebook conducts disaster recovery (DR) exercises to test its capability under actual disasters. These DR tests migrate requests from potentially failing DCs to healthier ones, exploring inter-service dependencies and dynamic resource constraints to identify real-time mitigation plans. Each candidate plan creates a drastic shift in the original TM. For a network planned with Pipe, each TM must be carefully evaluated to ensure the current production backbone can accommodate the changed TM. With Hose-based planning, a planner can provide an upper bound on the total ingress and egress traffic supported per DC. By looking at current traffic utilization, one can quantify additional traffic that can be added without overloading the region, providing deterministic DR buffers for operational teams.

#### 7.2 Partial Hose
Our Hose model assumes that a service would send traffic to any destination region. However, some services may only need to communicate with a small subset of regions, as their placement is limited. For example, a data warehouse service uses a specialized server type available in only 4 regions, accounting for 75% of the total inter-region traffic between these 4 regions. Considering service placement can help estimate Demand Traffic Matrices (DTMs) more accurately. In this case, we can create a smaller Hose for these 4 regions and a larger Hose for the remaining traffic. This partial Hose model provides additional information on application communication patterns. We use partial Hose under two conditions: (1) if the service's traffic volume is significantly large, and (2) if the service placement is inherently limited by hardware resources, making it difficult to move the service to other regions.

#### 7.3 A/B Testing
Testing network plans using demand forecasts and modeling assumptions for production networks is challenging. The actual performance becomes clear only months or years after deployment. In practice, we rely on extensive A/B testing and manual verification by experts from network planning, sourcing, and deployment teams. We set up A/B testing for different network build plans, comparing key metrics such as IP topology, optical fiber count, cost, flow availability, latency, and unsatisfied failures. Experts then check these designs for anomalies. Our testing strategy is currently based on engineering knowledge, and we encourage more research to enable scientific A/B testing for network build plans.

#### 7.4 Stability of Parameter Setting
In production, we find that the choice of parameters, such as Hose coverage, is stable over time. This stability is due to the relative stability of traffic demand variations. Backbone traffic is dominated by machine-to-machine traffic between DCs, reflecting service placement. In production, service placement is relatively stable to accommodate various infrastructure constraints, such as server availability, fault tolerance requirements, and disaster recovery planning. Complete demand shifts are rare, but moderate shifts of 30-50% traffic between different regions are common under different failures. This leads to our engineering choice of 83% Hose coverage, as demonstrated in Section 6.

### 8. Related Work
#### Hose Model in Virtual Private Network (VPN)
Duffield et al. [9] introduced the Hose model for resource management in VPNs, allocating bandwidth to satisfy Hose-conformant worst-case traffic distribution. Follow-up work has improved dynamic bandwidth resizing [7, 10, 20]. These studies allocate existing bandwidth resources to guarantee Hose requirements, while our work designs the underlying network to satisfy all possible traffic splits under a Hose. Our work is more closely related to [15], which designs a tree topology to satisfy Hose, while our solution works with general graphs.

#### Hose Model in Cloud Resource Sharing
Hose is used to model demands in DCs [4] and cloud environments [4, 8, 14, 17â€“19]. These studies use the Hose model for per-VM traffic demand and abstract the network fabric with a big virtual switch. For instance, Oktopus [4] proposes a VM placement algorithm based on Hose constraints, summing the worst-case TMs and leading to significant over-provisioning. Our approach is more efficient, using an operationally effective slack factor to choose hard-enough TMs, resulting in multiplexing gains as demonstrated in production (Section 6.2).

#### Network Planning
Scenario-based planning addresses traffic uncertainty by using forecast results for specific network scenarios, emphasizing a set of TMs [23]. Our selection of TMs is more general, not limited by predefined scenarios. Zhang et al. [24] propose finding critical TMs by clustering for general network analysis, but their work is not tailored for network planning. We are interested in applying their algorithm to network planning and comparing its efficacy to our DTM selection algorithm. Little has been revealed about production network planning except for a brief introduction in [5]. To our knowledge, we are the first to describe real-world network planning in detail.

### 9. Conclusion
Network planning plays a crucial role in long-term network evolution and service growth. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using the Hose model for network planning, leveraging its multiplexing gain to save capacity and absorb traffic uncertainty. We share our experience in planning a production backbone over several years, shedding light on the potential of Hose in a new problem domain and stimulating further research in this area.
