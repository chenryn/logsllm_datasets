structure of the public key 𝑄2. Being empowered by Rowhammer
and the bit-tracing attack, we take the attack further into full recov-
ery of all key bits. This is achieved by converting the MQ system
into smaller under-determined MQ systems which are in the same
form as the original MQ system. Instead of decomposing the matrix,
we regroup the equations into a discrete set of variables. Without
the amplification of the fault attack, it would not be possible to
solve the smaller MQ systems since they are underdetermined. In
this sense, our overall QuantumHammerattack represent a novel
approach.
Preventing Algebraic Collapse: What enables QuantumHam-
mer is that the MQ equations use a small subset of the key bits in
the way the key generation primitive is defined for LUOV. Hence,
recovering a small fraction of the key bits via Rowhammer and
the bit-tracing attack was sufficient to collapse the MQ system to
smaller size tractable MQ systems. In many scenarios, a small frac-
tion of the key bits may be recovered using side-channel attacks.
Hence this attack poses a serious threat to real-life deployments.
To prevent such collapse it would be prudent to check the resulting
MQ system underlying the security of the scheme at design time
under the assumption that any fixed size subset of the key bits are
compromised.
8 CONCLUSION
Rowhammer attack can lead to serious consequences by flipping
bits in other processes and leaking key information. Post-quantum
schemes are expected to replace the existing public-key schemes in
near future. This research shows that both hardware and crypto-
graphic security are of utmost importance for cryptosystems. LUOV
signature scheme, currently in round two of NIST’s PQC standard-
ization process is based on the well known oil and vinegar scheme
which withstood over two decades of cryptanalysis. We have ana-
lyzed the scheme both mathematically and implementation wise
and found weaknesses in both areas. The QuantumHammerattack
combines both weaknesses to launch a successful attack recovering
the full secret key of the scheme. There is a need to evaluate the
hardware and software implementations of the cryptosystems in
combination with the mathematical evaluation.
