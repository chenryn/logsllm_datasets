I am working with Google App Engine (Python) and I would like to implement an OpenID login with a default provider, so users can log in seamlessly. After the user successfully logs in via OpenID, I want to prompt them for a password. If the user enters the correct password, they should be able to access static content (HTML pages). If the password is incorrect, they should be redirected to another page. This protection needs to be implemented on the server side.

I am looking for a solution similar to `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd` but tailored for Google App Engine. Any suggestions?

**Response:**

To my knowledge, Google App Engine does not natively support a setup where you can require a static password after an OpenID login. However, you can achieve this by serving the static content through a custom handler. Hereâ€™s a possible approach:

1. **Client Requests Static Content:**
   - The client makes a request for the static content.

2. **Handler Registration:**
   - Register a custom handler to manage the URL for the static content.

3. **Authentication Check:**
   - The handler checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it prompts the user to enter a password.

4. **Password Verification:**
   - If the user enters the correct password, the handler reads the static file and sends it back to the user.
   - If the password is incorrect, the handler redirects the user to another page.

By following this approach, you can ensure that the static content is protected and only accessible to users who have both logged in via OpenID and entered the correct password.
