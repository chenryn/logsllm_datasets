User: So I'm working with AppEngine (Python) and what I want to do is to provide OpenID Login setting a Default provider so the user can Log-In without problems using that provider. The thing is, I want to prompt the user a Password right after they login in order to show static content (HTML Pages); If the user doesn't enter the correct password then I want to redirect them to another page. The protection has to be server side please :) Any Ideas??
P.S. I'm seeking for a solution similar to ".htaccess/htpasswd" but for app engine.
Assistant: AFAIK, GAE does not support such setup (static password after OpenID login).
The only way I see to make this work would be to serve static content via your handler: 

Client makes a request for static content
Your handler is registered to handle this URL
Handler checks is user is authenticated. If not, requests a password.
When authenticated, handler reads static file and sends it back to user.
