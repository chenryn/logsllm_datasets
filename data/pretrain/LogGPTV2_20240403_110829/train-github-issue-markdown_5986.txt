Hello,

It would be great to have the capability to perform parallel processing using `joblib` when applying operations to a `groupby` object. I envision an optional `parallel` argument, which defaults to `False`.

I believe it would be most effective to include this `parallel` argument directly in the `groupby` method. Currently, the only workaround is to create a list from the `groupby` results, apply a function to that list using `joblib`, and then concatenate the results. This approach leads to inefficient and hard-to-read code.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how this feature could be used:

```python
# Parallel fillna
data.groupby(...).fillna(..., parallel=True)

# Parallel apply
data.groupby(...).apply(..., parallel=True)

# Parallel custom operation
data.groupby(...).whatever(..., parallel=True)

# Non-parallel custom operation
data.groupby(...).whatever(...)  # not parallel
```

This enhancement would greatly improve the efficiency and readability of the code, especially for large datasets and complex operations.

Best regards,
