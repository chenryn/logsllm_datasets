Hello,
It would be nice to have the possibility to do parallel processing using
`joblib` when applying something to a groupby. I'm dreaming about a `parallel`
optional argument which defaults to `False`.
I think it's best to have that parallel argument while grouping
The only option I have now is to make list on the groupby results, apply a
function on that list using joblib, and concatenate the results. It leads to
unefficient and difficult to read code.
    ############
    # Examples #
    ############
    data.groupby(...).fillna(..., parallel=True)
    data.groupby(...).apply(..., parallel=True)
    data.groupby(...).whatever(..., parallel=True)
    data.groupby(...).whatever(...) # not parallel
