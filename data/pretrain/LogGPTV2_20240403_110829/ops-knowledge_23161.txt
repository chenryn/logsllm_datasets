User: This is my first time using Eclipse, so I think it must be some newbie configuration error. However, I can not sort it out, so I hope one of you might be able to help me.
This is what I did:

Installed Python 2.7
Installed EasyEclipse for Python 1.3.1
Went to Window>Preferences>Pydev>Interpreter-Python and selected C:\python27\python.exe
Created a new project (when I had to select project type, there was only python 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, so I selected 2.5, even though I am running 2.7)
Created a file in that project with a simple helloworld.
Clicked the "Run" play button.

When I do this, I get the error "The selection cannot be launched, and there are no recent launches."
As I said, I get the feeling this is just some configuration issue. In particular, could it be something about my "run configuration"? I see this as a dialog box, but I really don't know what I am supposed to be doing in it.
Your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Assistant: I got it. When I was creating a file, I needed to specify the .py extension. After doing this, the file ran.
