This is my first time using Eclipse, and I suspect that I might be encountering a common configuration issue for beginners. Despite my efforts, I have been unable to resolve the problem on my own, so I am reaching out for assistance.

Here are the steps I followed:

1. Installed Python 2.7.
2. Installed EasyEclipse for Python 1.3.1.
3. Navigated to **Window > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreter - Python** and selected `C:\python27\python.exe`.
4. Created a new project. During the project creation, I was only given options for Python 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5. Since I am running Python 2.7, I chose Python 2.5.
5. Created a file within the project with a simple "Hello, World!" script.
6. Attempted to run the file by clicking the "Run" play button.

However, when I tried to run the file, I received the following error: "The selection cannot be launched, and there are no recent launches."

I suspect this might be a configuration issue, possibly related to my "run configuration." I have seen the run configuration dialog box, but I am unsure of how to properly set it up.

Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

**Update:**

I have resolved the issue. The problem was that I did not specify the `.py` extension when creating the file. After adding the correct file extension, the file ran successfully.
