**Title: Legal GNSS Spoofing and Its Effects on Autonomous Vehicles at Black Hat US 2019**

Many critical systems, including those in autonomous vehicles, rely on accurate location data provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, public GNSS signals lack robust integrity mechanisms, making them vulnerable to spoofing attacks. U.S. federal law prohibits over-the-air spoofing of GNSS and other signals, which complicates the assessment of these vulnerabilities in real-world settings outside of controlled laboratory environments.

This research demonstrates the utility of a Mobile GNSS Spoofing System that allows for legal, real-world evaluation of GNSS vulnerabilities. The mobile spoofing system was employed to assess the security of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). Various attacks were conducted, including forced lane switching, driving the UGV off the road, and causing it to stop. These experiments highlight the potential risks and the need for enhanced security measures in GNSS-dependent systems.
