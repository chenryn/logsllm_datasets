I get the following error
    julia> x=[1,2]
    2-element Array{Int64,1}:
    Evaluation succeeded, but an error occurred while showing value of type Array{Int64,1}:
    ERROR: premature end of integer: "24"
     in error at error.jl:21

The premature end of integer: "24" appears to be somewhat arbitrary. The error
message above was obtained in the shell that opens upon double-clicking the
julia application. However, when I call julia from emacs (using ESS) the
ERROR-line reads
    ERROR: premature end of integer: "25"
Otherwise the error message is the same.
