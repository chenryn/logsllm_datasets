enumerate all possible combinations, in a computing environment 
with  an  Intel  Core  I7  processor  and  24  GB  of  memory.  This 
shows  that  the  time-consuming  operations  cannot  keep  up  with 
the  changing  web,  especially  for  those  phishing  websites.  The 
page content of the suspected URLs may be removed and labeled 
as  unavailable  without  obtaining  an  assured  category.  In  our 
PhishTrack  approach,  the  two  proposed  components  T1  and  T2 
came  the  similar  numbers  regardless  of  which  metrics  are 
concerned.  There  were  91.97%  (i.e.,  2165/2354)  of  found 
phishing  URLs  are  newly  discovered.  In  other  words,  they  had 
not  been  collected  in  the  blacklist  released  by  PhishTank.  We 
further analyzed the errors of our proposed approach. We found 
that  most  of  false  positive  cases  are  related  to  some  specific 
hosting  services.  The  phishing  websites  had  been  removed  and 
returned  to  legitimate  homepage  of  hosting  providers.  These 
errors can be avoided with an exception list, which contains well-
known  legitimate  domain  names.  In  addition,  there  are  few 
unavailable  instances,  because  our  method  took  about  only  10 
hours given the same data in the same computing environment. 
In  summary, 
the 
PhishTrack approach obviously discovered more phishing URLs 
and predicted fewer incorrect URLs than the PhishNet approach. 
In  addition,  comparing  PhishNet  with  PhishTrack,  the  former 
needs  certain  amount  of  collected  phishing  URLs  for  observing 
specific  heuristic  patterns,  while  the  latter  can  work  using 
individual phishing URL by tracking criminals’ behavioral trails. 
The former also expends large amounts of execution time. These 
findings  show  that  our  approach  is  effective  and  efficient  for 
proactive blacklist update. Intrinsically, the proposed PhishTrack 
approach is more proper to block the phishing accesses actively 
for avoiding threats to be propagated unlimitedly.

According to most recent Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) 
industry advisory [1], the average life span of phishing attacks in 
2H2013  was  28  hours  and  43  minutes,  in  which  half  of  all 
phishing attacks live for less than 8 hours. These findings reveal 
that  time  is  a  critical  factor  for  curbing  phishing  crimes.  In 
response, PhishTank releases the recent phishing blacklists every 
hour  for  anti-phishing.  We  hourly  downloaded  the  brand-new 
blacklist containing phishing URLs belonging to PayPal target on 
14496th  July  2014.  Each  blacklist  is  regarded  as  a  seed  for  updating 
blacklist actively using our proposed PhishTrack approach. Figure 
1  compares  the  URL  differences  between  the  original  blacklists 
and our updated ones. The numbers of URL entries in the original 
blacklists were marked in purple color. The numbers of unsuitable 
URLs  at  the  experimental  time  is  denoted  in  blue  color.  The 
numbers  of  retained  URLs  and  newly  discovered  ones  are 
represented  in  red  and  green  color,  respectively.  The  average 
number  of  URL  entries  in  the  original  PhishTank’s  blacklists  is 
2081.67. There are no significant differences among the original 
blacklists,  because  about  99%  of  URLs  were  kept  in  the 
continuous  6  hours.  Empirical  analysis  indicated  that  our 
approach  found  578.83  new  URLs  and  removed  1101.67 
ineffective  ones  on  average.  The  average  number  of  URLs 
included in our updated blacklists is 1558.83. This shows that our 
update method can actively find suspected URLs and remove the 
out-of-update  ones  to  form  the  on-the–fly  phishing  blacklist  for 
reflecting  the  real  web  situation.  Besides,  our  model  spent  less 
than  20  minutes  to  finish  the  update  process  performed  in  a 
parallel computing framework. It is significantly less than average 
78.9 hours consumed by PhishTank for phishing verification. 
Figure 1. URL differences between the original and updated blacklists 
In  summary,  the  PhishTank  provides  a  crowd-sourcing  platform 
in  which  volunteers  can  submit  and  verify  the  suspected  URLs 
manually. If nobody submits the phishing URLs in real time, it is 
impossible to include them in the released blacklists. In addition, 
if a submitted URL wastes much time for waiting the voting result, 
it may be unavailable even the true category belongs to phishing 
threat  and  the  criminals  have  achieved  their  phishing  purpose. 
Different  from  PhishTank  mechanism,  our  PhishTrack  approach 
automatically  updates  the  existing  blacklists  to  find  on-the-fly 
phishing URLs actively. Intuitively, our solution is more suitable 
to the rapidly changing web. 
4.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This  work  demonstrates  the  feasibility  of  exploring  the  existing 
blacklists  for  discovering  the  on-the-fly  phishing  URLs  in  real 
time.  A  proactive  blacklist  update  mechanism  that  consists  of 
redirection  tracking  and  form  tracking  is  proposed  to  find 
suspected URLs as early as possible.  Experimental  results  show 
that  PhishTrack  is  an  effective  and  efficient  method  that  yields 
promising performance. In practice, it needs to be complemented 
by  other  phishing  detection  schemes  for  enhancing  blacklisting. 
How to keep up with the changing trails of phishing threats within 
very short time periods is a really challenging research problem.  
A  more  aggressive  strategy  will  be  investigated  in  the  future  to 
achieve more satisfactory blocking performance for anti-phishing.
