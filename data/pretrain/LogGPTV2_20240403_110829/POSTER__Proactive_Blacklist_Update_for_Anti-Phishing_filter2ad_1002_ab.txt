### Enumerating Combinations and Evaluating Phishing Detection Approaches

In a computing environment equipped with an Intel Core I7 processor and 24 GB of memory, enumerating all possible combinations can be computationally intensive. This highlights the challenge of keeping up with the rapidly changing web, particularly in the context of phishing websites. The content of suspected URLs may be removed and labeled as unavailable before they are categorized. 

In our PhishTrack approach, the two proposed components, T1 and T2, yielded similar results across various metrics. Specifically, 91.97% (i.e., 2165 out of 2354) of the detected phishing URLs were newly discovered, meaning they had not been included in the PhishTank blacklist. Further analysis of the errors in our approach revealed that most false positives were related to specific hosting services. These errors can be mitigated by maintaining an exception list containing well-known legitimate domain names.

Additionally, there were few instances of unavailable URLs, as our method took approximately only 10 hours to process the same data in the same computing environment. In summary, the PhishTrack approach discovered more phishing URLs and predicted fewer incorrect ones compared to the PhishNet approach. PhishNet requires a substantial amount of collected phishing URLs to observe specific heuristic patterns, whereas PhishTrack can operate using individual phishing URLs by tracking criminals' behavioral trails. PhishNet also consumes a significant amount of execution time. These findings indicate that our approach is both effective and efficient for proactive blacklist updates. Intrinsically, the PhishTrack approach is better suited for actively blocking phishing accesses to prevent threats from propagating indefinitely.

### Experimental Results

The experimental results, summarized in Table 1, show the performance evaluation of the phishing update methods.

| Methods | #Phish | #NotPhish | #N.A. |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| PhishNet | 963    | 29        | 875   |
| PhishTrack | 1,140 | 11        | 168   |
| H1      | 32     | 26        | 10    |
| H2      | 780    | 3         | 747   |
| H3      | 129    | 0         | 38    |
| H4      | 22     | 0         | 80    |
| H5      | 0      | 0         | 0     |
| All     | 2,354  | 26        | 875   |

According to the most recent Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) industry advisory [1], the average lifespan of phishing attacks in the second half of 2013 was 28 hours and 43 minutes, with half of all phishing attacks lasting less than 8 hours. This underscores the critical role of time in curbing phishing crimes. In response, PhishTank releases updated phishing blacklists every hour. We downloaded the latest blacklists containing PayPal-targeted phishing URLs on July 6, 2014, and used them as seeds for updating blacklists using our PhishTrack approach.

Figure 1 compares the URL differences between the original and updated blacklists. The numbers of URL entries in the original blacklists are marked in purple, unsuitable URLs at the experimental time in blue, retained URLs in red, and newly discovered ones in green. The average number of URL entries in the original PhishTank blacklists is 2081.67, with about 99% of URLs remaining consistent over 6 continuous hours. Our approach found an average of 578.83 new URLs and removed 1101.67 ineffective ones, resulting in an average of 1558.83 URLs in the updated blacklists. This demonstrates that our update method can actively find suspected URLs and remove outdated ones to reflect the real web situation. Additionally, our model completed the update process in under 20 minutes using a parallel computing framework, significantly faster than the 78.9 hours consumed by PhishTank for phishing verification.

### Summary and Future Work

PhishTank provides a crowd-sourcing platform where volunteers can submit and verify suspected URLs manually. If no one submits phishing URLs in real-time, they cannot be included in the released blacklists. Furthermore, if a submitted URL takes too long to be verified, it may become unavailable even if it is a genuine phishing threat. In contrast, the PhishTrack approach automatically updates existing blacklists to find on-the-fly phishing URLs, making it more suitable for the rapidly changing web.

### Conclusions and Future Work

This work demonstrates the feasibility of exploring existing blacklists to discover on-the-fly phishing URLs in real-time. A proactive blacklist update mechanism, consisting of redirection and form tracking, is proposed to find suspected URLs as early as possible. Experimental results show that PhishTrack is an effective and efficient method. In practice, it should be complemented by other phishing detection schemes to enhance blacklisting. Keeping up with the changing trails of phishing threats within very short time periods remains a challenging research problem. Future work will investigate more aggressive strategies to achieve better blocking performance for anti-phishing.
