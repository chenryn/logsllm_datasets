## Abstract
Fiber optic cables connecting data centers are a significant investment for large organizations. The importance of these cables has led to a conservative deployment approach with built-in redundancy and reliability. In this work, we propose a more dynamic approach by adapting the capacity of fiber optic links based on their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We analyzed the SNR of over 2,000 links in an optical backbone over a three-year period and found that the capacity of 64% of IP links can be increased by at least 75 Gbps, resulting in an overall capacity gain of over 134 Tbps. Additionally, reducing the link capacity can prevent 25% of link failures, leading to higher capacity and better availability.

We introduce RADWAN, a traffic engineering system that allows optical links to adapt their rate based on observed SNR, achieving higher throughput and availability while minimizing churn during capacity reconfigurations. We evaluated RADWAN using a testbed with 1,540 km of fiber and 16 amplifiers and attenuators. Simulations show that RADWAN improves overall network throughput by 40% compared to state-of-the-art systems. The service provider we studied is implementing the necessary infrastructure to deploy the first variable-capacity link between Canada and Europe this year.

## 1. Introduction
Optical backbones are multi-million dollar assets, with fiber being the most expensive component. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook invest heavily in fiber to support wide-area connectivity between distant data centers. However, due to conservative provisioning, they have not fully leveraged this investment. Our analysis shows that wide-area fiber links often exhibit better signal quality (measured by SNR) than the minimum required for 100 Gbps transmission, leaving potential capacity untapped.

By analyzing historical SNR data from 2,000 optical channels, we found that the capacity of 64% of links can be augmented by 75 Gbps or more, leading to a total capacity gain of over 134 Tbps. Simply raising link capacities statically to a higher value (e.g., 150 Gbps or 200 Gbps) supported by the SNR increases the risk of link failures due to fluctuations in signal quality. Conversely, reducing the transmission rate from 100 Gbps to 50 Gbps can mitigate at least 25% of current failures.

The fundamental issue is the orthodoxy in wired network operation, where a fiber link is either up with a fixed capacity or down, largely ignoring changes in the underlying optical signal quality. Wireless networks, however, use adaptive bit-rate schemes to respond to changing signal quality. While these schemes face practical challenges in wireless communication, optical links are well-suited for rate adaptation due to the coarser time granularity of signal quality variations and the ease of inferring signal quality from bit-error rates (BER).

We present RADWAN (Rate Adaptive WAN), a system that adapts channel bit-rates in WANs to improve overall throughput and availability. RADWAN includes a centralized controller that adjusts the modulation format of fiber channels based on SNR. By switching to lower modulation formats, RADWAN allows critical WAN links to function at lower data rates instead of failing. We make two key contributions:

1. **Optimal WAN Traffic Engineering**: We address the latency incurred by network hardware when changing link modulation formats. Our centralized traffic engineering optimization problem minimizes unnecessary capacity reconfiguration, improving overall network throughput by 40% in real-world scenarios.
   
2. **Avoiding High Latency of Modulation Reconfiguration**: We built a testbed emulating a four-datacenter WAN connected via 1,540 km of fiber. Our experiments show that reconfiguring modulation formats on commodity hardware incurs an average latency of 68 seconds. We developed a prototype that reduces this reconfiguration time by a factor of 1,000.

RADWAN opens new research avenues, such as graph abstractions for networks with dynamic capacity links and the impact on classical networking algorithms. It also provides a foundation for smart capacity planning, failure recovery, load balancing, and on-demand bandwidth allocation. A major service provider is deploying the first operational dynamic capacity link between Canada and Europe in 2018.

## 2. Quantifying the Opportunity
We analyzed the signal quality in a large optical backbone comprising 2,000 optical channels. Our dataset includes the average, minimum, and maximum SNR per channel, aggregated over 15-minute intervals for three years.

### 2.1 Characterizing SNR in our WAN
The average SNR can support much more than the configured link rate of 100 Gbps. Figure 1(a) shows the distribution of the average SNR, indicating that over 64% of channels can support data rates of 175 Gbps. This represents a significant opportunity to improve throughput by operating closer to the actual SNR.

Figure 1(b) illustrates the stability of SNR over time for 40 channels on the same WAN fiber cable. Despite occasional dips, the SNR remains well above 6.5 dB, highlighting over-provisioning by network operators to prevent link failures.

Figure 1(c) shows the variability of SNR across different time scales. For intervals of 15 minutes, 10 hours, 1 day, and 1 week, we calculated the SNR variation for all optical channels. The results confirm that SNR remains stable over several hours, with only a small fraction (â‰¤ 5%) of links observing significant variation in the 10-hour interval.

While it might seem feasible to increase the transmission rate of all links based on the stable SNR, infrequent but sizeable variations in SNR can lead to increased link failures. Therefore, dynamic adaptation is essential to maintain high throughput and availability.
