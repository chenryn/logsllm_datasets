width is reserved for f1. Weights for the other ﬂows
are computed similarly.
is allocated the entire output bandwidth. The weight wi of
ﬂow fi is deﬁned as its reserved bandwidth normalized with
respect to the total bandwidth of the output link, i.e.,
wi =
ri
R
(2)
In other words, the weight wi of a ﬂow represents the
fraction of the output bandwidth that is reserved for ﬂow
fi. Therefore
wi ≤ 1
i=N
Xi=1
Figure 1 shows an output link being shared by multiple
ﬂows and how the weight of each ﬂow is computed. Band-
width is allocated to ﬂows in proportion to their weights.
If all N ﬂows are backlogged, i.e., have packets queued for
transmission, the average bandwidth allocated to fi should
be
R ≥ ri
wi
j=N
j=1 wj

Therefore the bandwidth allocated to a backlogged ﬂow fi
is always at least its reserved bandwidth ri. Equality occurs
i=N
i=1 wi = 1, i.e., the output bandwidth is completely
when 
allocated among the N ﬂows.
In a fashion similar to round-robin schedulers, Stratiﬁed
Round Robin assigns slots to ﬂows. When a ﬂow is assigned
a slot, it is allowed to send a certain number of its queued
packets over the output link. The main scheduling deci-
sion is to decide which of the N ﬂows is assigned the next
slot. However, in order to avoid the poor delay properties
of round-robin schemes, while simultaneously retaining their
low complexity, Stratiﬁed Round Robin must do something
beyond simply allocating slots in circular fashion. The key
idea, which enables getting the best of both worlds, is to
aggregate ﬂows into ﬂow classes.
3.2 Flow stratiﬁcation
Flows are “stratiﬁed” into ﬂow classes based on their
weights. More formally, for k ≥ 1, ﬂow class Fk is deﬁned
as
Fk = (cid:26)fi :
1
2k
≤ wi  0. Let A denote the set of active
ﬂow classes. A backlogged ﬂow fi ∈ Fk is called pending if
fi has not been assigned a slot in Fk’s current scheduling
interval. Intuitively, a pending ﬂow is one that has not re-
cently received its fair share of bandwidth. A ﬂow class is
called pending if it contains at least one pending ﬂow. Let
P denote the set of pending ﬂow classes.
As mentioned before, the basic strategy is to assign every
ﬂow fi ∈ Fk exactly one slot in each scheduling interval of
Fk. The end of the current scheduling interval of a ﬂow class
is therefore a deadline for all backlogged ﬂows belonging to
that ﬂow class to be assigned a slot. Like a deadline-based
scheme, the inter-class scheduler selects the ﬂow class Fk
with the earliest deadline. The intra-class scheduler then
assigns a ﬂow fi ∈ Fk the current slot. Note that while
choosing a ﬂow class, only those that are pending are con-
sidered for assigning slots. A ﬂow class Fk ceases to be
pending when all ﬂows belonging to Fk have been assigned
a slot in its current scheduling interval. When the last pend-
ing ﬂow fi ∈ Fk is assigned a slot, Fk is no longer pending.
In this case, Fk remains like that until the start of its next
scheduling interval, when all ﬂows belonging to Fk become
pending again.
After servicing a ﬂow in the current time slot, the clock
time tC must be advanced. If there are any pending ﬂow
classes, tC is incremented by 1. Otherwise, tC is advanced
to the earliest time when some ﬂow class becomes pending
again 2. In either case, the set of pending ﬂow classes P must
be updated to include all ﬂow classes that become pending
at the new clock time tC .
Figure 2 illustrates an example of Stratiﬁed Round Robin
assigning slots to ﬂows in the example of Figure 1. Notice
that each ﬂow receives slots in proportion to its approximate
weight as given by the ﬂow class it belongs to. For example,
ﬂow f1 receives 8 slots out of 16 because it belongs to class
F1. Flows f2 and f3 each receive 2 slots out of 16 because
they belong to the same class F3 even though their actual
weights are diﬀerent. Also note that slots 13 and 15 are
not shown because no packets are sent in these slots and
therefore no real time elapses. After slots 12 and 14, no
ﬂows classes are pending and therefore the clock advances
to the next slot when a ﬂow class becomes pending.
3.4 Intra-class scheduling
Within a ﬂow class, ﬂows are scheduled in round-robin
fashion. Every time a ﬂow fi is assigned a slot, it is given
a credit ci, which determines how many bytes the ﬂow is
allowed to send in that slot. Round-robin schedulers like
DRR give each ﬂow a ﬁxed-size credit of LM bits where LM
is the maximum packet size. This ensures that at least one
packet will be sent every time a ﬂow is assigned a slot. A
deﬁcit counter is used to carry over unused credit to the
next slot in the event the ﬂow is backlogged but unable to
send a packet due to insuﬃcient credit. This mechanism is
necessary to prevent unfair allocation of bandwidth caused
by diﬀerent packet sizes used by diﬀerent ﬂows. Therefore
the number of bytes transmitted by ﬂow fi in one slot is at
most ci + di.
Stratiﬁed Round Robin operates in a similar manner, but
with an important diﬀerence. Every time ﬂow fi ∈ Fk is as-
signed a slot, rather than being given a ﬁxed-size credit, it
is given a credit that is proportional to its weight wi. Recall
that two ﬂows fi and fj may belong to the same class Fk
even though wi may be up to twice as large as wj . How-
ever both fi and fj are assigned exactly one slot in every
scheduling interval of Fk. To ensure that the service received
by these ﬂows are proportional to their respective weights,
the credit given to them every time they are assigned a slot
must also be made proportional to their weights 3. There-
fore, a ﬂow fi ∈ Fk is assigned a weight-proportional credit
of
