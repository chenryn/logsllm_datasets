conﬁguration devoted to each task. We do so by manually associ-
ating each command in the conﬁguration language with a unique
function. Table 2 shows the list of the functions we use in our anal-
ysis, with several example commands for each of the categories.
Given this categorization, we construct a database that maps conﬁg-
uration commands to one of these functions. Due to the abstraction
we apply to the conﬁgurations, we do lose ﬁne-grain information
that can be valuable to our study, but the goal of this work is to offer
a high-level analysis of network conﬁguration and its evolution.
Although our categorization is extensive, the mapping does not
cover all conﬁguration commands: some commands are difﬁcult
to classify or do not map to any particular function (e.g., commit

• Longitudinal analysis. To understand how the network con-
ﬁguration has evolved over time, and the primary factors un-
derlying different evolution patterns, we perform a longitu-
dinal analysis of conﬁguration changes, using ﬁve years of
RCS ﬁles from each network.
• Correlation analysis. To understand whether certain aspects
of the network conﬁguration frequently change together, we
perform a correlation analysis to determine network conﬁg-
uration tasks that operators commonly perform together.
Our toolkit parses each RCS ﬁle and aggregates information for the
snapshot and basic change analysis, such as how many lines of con-
ﬁguration are devoted to each function, how many changes occur
and what types of changes (i.e., addition, deletion, modiﬁcation)
occur, when and where these changes happen. It also parses the
data and author information from the RCS ﬁles determine the fre-
quency of changes made on certain days, times, and by certain au-
thors. The toolkit then inserts this information into a database that
performs the longitudinal and stanza analysis. Correlation analysis
requires additional software functionality, beyond gathering ﬁrst-
order statistics. To perform this analysis, the toolkit parses the RCS
ﬁles and extracts every version of the conﬁguration ﬁle. The conﬁg-
uration ﬁles are parsed, and stanzas from each conﬁguration ﬁle are
stored in a database, using which we can study correlated changes.
4. THE EVOLUTION OF CONFIGURATION
We now present results on network conﬁguration evolution in the
two campus networks. In the process, we identify change charac-
teristics that the campuses share in common and those where they
differ. We augment our analysis with operator discussions to shed
light on the impact of operational practices on conﬁguration evolu-
tion in the respective campuses.

Time of Day
Figure 3: Changes to the UW network conﬁguration over a day.
We make the following high-level observations. First, the net-
works have a similar number of ﬁrewalls, but UW has nearly four
times as many routers and almost twice as many switches. Sec-
ond, although most changes happen in ﬁrewalls and switches (with
changes on switches dominating), routers, which are far fewer in
number, tend to have many more conﬁguration changes per de-
vice (on average) in both the GT and UW networks. We delve into
router conﬁguration changes in Section 4.2. Third, we ﬁnd interest-
ing differences between the two networks: in UW, switches clearly
undergo a large number of modiﬁcations relative both to other de-
vices in the same network, and to switches in the GT network. GT
has relatively more changes to its ﬁrewall devices than UW. We
delve into ﬁrewall and switch conﬁguration evolutions across the
two campuses in Sections 4.3 and 4.4, respectively.
When do changes occur? Figure 3 shows how conﬁguration
changes are distributed across hours of the day for UW. The pat-
tern shows that most changes to switches and routers are made dur-
ing the work hours. However, many of the conﬁguration changes
to ﬁrewalls happen later, as shown by a large increase in commits
around 8 p.m. In contrast to routers and switches, the ﬁrewall con-
ﬁgurations are often managed by a department-speciﬁc system ad-
ministrator and then transferred to a member of the campus IT staff,
who checks them for consistency and eventually uploads the ﬁles
to the ﬁrewalls and commits them toward, or after the end of, work-
ing hours. Figures 4a and 4b show how changes to network con-
ﬁguration are distributed across the months of the year in the two
networks. We observe that the number of conﬁguration changes
peaks during August. Our conversations with operators revealed
that, in both networks, large network-wide changes are put off un-
til the summer when many of the users are away and disruptions
might have the least detrimental effect on users of the network.
Table 5 summarizes the main ﬁndings from our analysis of these
two campus networks. We note several interesting characteristics
that may ultimately help understand network conﬁguration and its
evolution better, and ultimately devise better methods or tools for
device conﬁguration and management. The rest of this section dis-
cusses these ﬁndings and others in more detail.
4.2 Routers
We ﬁrst focus our analysis on routers. The main function of rou-
ters in the network is to support layer-3 routing, but, interestingly,
many of the conﬁguration changes on routers are associated with
tasks other than layer-3 routing.
What types of changes occur? We begin by measuring the num-
ber of conﬁguration commands changed for each device type and
normalize the results by the number of devices, as shown in Ta-
bles 3 and 4.

academic year.
Many changes in routers are security-related. Bulk
changes in routers come from security-related tasks, and
different campuses use different mechanisms, thus show-
ing dissimilar patterns of changes.
Deployment location matters. Where the device is
placed within the network , e.g., border vs edge, have sig-
niﬁcant inﬂuence on the size of change and what changes.
Intuitively, devices at the border undergo a lot more
changes than edge devices. In addition, the changes are
more restrictive at borders and are more closely moni-
tored.
Variety of network-wide tasks contribute to changes in
devices. This includes network expansion, change of pol-
icy, addition of new features or modiﬁcation of existing,
and provisioning new customers or deleting subnetworks.
Specialized devices are similar across different net-
works. Highly specialized network appliances, like ﬁre-
walls, tend to have very similar traits when it comes to
conﬁguration and its evolution.
Correlated changes in ﬁrewall devices occur within the
acl command. In ﬁrewalls, commands are highly concen-
trated on acl stanzas. However, we found highly corre-
lated behavior within the acl stanza, namely object deﬁni-
tion and actual access lists.
Switch conﬁguration is highly port-centered. Switches
are conﬁgured port-by-port, and batch changes on inter-
faces is frequent. l1 has a variety of subcommands, hence
large correlation occur among commands in switches, al-
though they differ by network and tasks assigned.

analyzing a snapshot of recent conﬁguration ﬁles from all routers
from each campus. Figures 5c and 5d present the changes occurring
in both networks over ﬁve years for the routers in each campus. In
both campuses, the l1 and l3 commands are added, deleted, or mod-
iﬁed most frequently. In the GT network, l2 changes are extremely
frequent, due to changes to static ARP entries, which we will ex-
plain in more detail later. There are many more modiﬁcations to the
UW network in general, many of which result from modiﬁcations to
the existing l1– l3 and vlan commands. Further investigation shows
that VLAN interface deﬁnitions in UW router conﬁgurations are
constantly changing due to addition, update and removal of “cus-
tomers” of the UW network (departments or groups of users with
speciﬁc needs, each group with its own VLAN). This explains the
large amount of the l1, l2 and vlan conﬁguration changes. As we
show later, the changes in l3 are due to security related changes to
a particular router.
Distinct security-related practices are found. Notably, many
conﬁguration changes to routers involve security-related tasks, al-
though the mechanisms that each network uses differ. Each campus
has security practices that use speciﬁc router conﬁguration com-
mands. The signiﬁcant amount of the l2 command changes in Fig-
ure 5c shows one example. Further inspection reveals that this is
due to static ARP entries in routers deployed in residence halls in
the GT network. The GT network maps each end host machine’s
MAC address to a static IP address in residence halls. The main
goal is to provide better security and more ﬁne-grained monitor-
ing. This part of the conﬁguration constantly undergoes changes as
residents come and go. We examine changes to the stanzas in the
routers for the different networks in Figures 6a and 6b. Our anal-
ysis shows that, on average, most routers in the UW network have
conﬁguration changes that reﬂect a consistent breakdown across
functions, regardless of the router. The exception to this pattern is
device 6, which has signiﬁcantly more layer-3 changes than other
devices. Upon further examination, we discovered that router is a
blackhole device. Blackhole ﬁltering, or null routing, provides a
ﬁrewalling service with minimal impact on performance, by rout-
ing certain trafﬁc to nowhere, and not providing any information
regarding what happened to the trafﬁc sources (no “no route to des-
tination” reported back; hence the term blackhole). This practice
uses “static routes” to manipulate the blackhole behavior; thus, we
see constant changes to l3 stanzas in this router device. This is
another example of using speciﬁc router conﬁguration commands
to achieve certain security goals. The GT network also has routers
with changes that are distinct from one another. Devices 5, 6, 7, and
8 are “resnet” routers in the campus dormitories with static ARPs.
Number of changes in core routers are noticeably larger than

network have many l1 and vlan changes, which are distinct from
other routers. These three routers are core routers through which
many VLANs are trunked. Core routers are responsible for routing
trafﬁc between the upper border gateway and subnets at the edge.
Many VLANs for edge subnets are aggregated (or trunked) at these
routers, so changes in each subnet can result in substantial changes
