and the delay for detecting attacks. The section ends with the study
of stealthy attacks.
5.7.1 Linear Model
In this paper we use the linear system characterized by the ma-
trices A, B, and C, obtained by linearizing the non-linear TE-PCS
model about the steady-state operating conditions. (See Ricker [49].)
The linear model is a good representative of the actual TE-PCS
Figure 5: The number of false alarms decreases exponentially
with increasing τ . This results conﬁrm the theory supporting
the nonparametric CUSUM algorithm.
In general, we would like to select τ as high as possible for each
sensor to avoid any false alarm; however, increasing τ increases the
time to detect attacks.
Detection Time.
To measure the time to detect attacks, we run simulations by
launching scaling attacks (ai(k) = λmyi(k)) on sensors y4, y5
and y7. Figs 6 and 7 shows the experimental results.
The selection of τ is a trade-off between detection time and the
number of false alarms. The appropriate value differs from system
to system. Because the large number of false alarms is one of the
main problems for anomaly detection systems, and because the TE-
PCS process takes at least 10 hours to reach the unsafe state (based
on our risk assessment section), we choose the conservative set of
parameters τy4 = 50, τy5 = 10000, τy7 = 200. These parameters
allow us to detect attacks within a couple of hours, while not raising
any false alarms.

CUSUM statistic shown in Fig. 10 shows how the attacker remains
undetected until time T = 30 (hrs).
We found that a surge attack does not cause signiﬁcant damages
because of the inertia of the chemical reactor: by the time the statis-
tic reaches the threshold τ , the chemical reactor is only starting to
respond to the attack. However, since the attacker can only add
very small variations to the signal once it is close to the thresh-
old, the attack ceases to produce any effect and the plant continues
operating normally.

5.7.3 Stealthy Attacks
To test if our selected values for τ are resilient to stealthy attacks,
we decided to investigate the effect of stealhty attacks as a function
of τ . To test how the attacks change for all threshols we parameter-
ize each threshold by a parameter p: τ test
i = pτi. Fig. 8 shows the
percentage of times that geometric stealthy attacks (assuming the
attacker controls all three sensor readings) were able to drive the
pressure above 3000kPa while remaining undetected (as a function
of p).

promised.
Finally, we assume two types of attackers. An attacker that has
compromised y5 (but who does not know the values of the other
sensors, and therefore can only control Sy5 (k)), and an attacker
that has compromised all three sensors (and therefore can control
the statistic S(k) for all sensors). We launched each attack 20
times. The results are summarized in Figure 11.

sure of the tank above 3,000kPa as a function of scaling param-
eter p.
We implemented all stealth attacks starting at time T = 10
(hrs). We assume the goal of the attacker is to be undetected until
T = 30 (hrs). For example, Fig. 9 shows the results of attack-
ing all three sensors with a geometric attack. The nonparametric

Our results show that even though our detection algorithm fails to
detect stealthy attacks, we can keep the the plant in safe conditions.
We also ﬁnd that the most successful attack strategy are geometric
attacks.
6. RESPONSE TO ATTACKS
A comprehensive security posture for any system should include
mechanisms for prevention, detection, and response to attacks. Au-
tomatic response to computer attacks is one of the fundamental
problems in information assurance. While most of the research
efforts found in the literature focus on prevention (authentication,
access controls, cryptography etc.) or detection (intrusion detec-
tion systems), in practice there are quite a few response mecha-
nisms. For example, many web servers send CAPTCHAs to the
client whenever they ﬁnd that connections resemble bot connec-
tions, ﬁrewalls drop connections that conform to their rules, the ex-
ecution of anomalous processes can be slowed down by intrusion
detection systems, etc.
Given that we already have an estimate for the state of the system
(given by a linear model), a natural response strategy for control
systems is to use this estimate when the anomaly detection statistic
ﬁres an alarm. Fig 12 shows our proposed architecture. Speciﬁ-
cally: for sensor i, if Si(k) > τi, the ADM replaces the sensor
measurements ˜yi(k) with measurements generated by the linear
model ˆyi(k) (that is the controller will receive as input ˆyi(k) in-
stead of ˜yi(k)). Otherwise, it treats ˜yi(k) as the correct sensor
signal.
Computing Blocks
Figure 12: An Anomaly Detection Module (ADM) can detect
an attack and send an estimate of the state of the system to the
controller.
Introducing automatic response mechanisms is, however, not an
easy solution. Every time systems introduce an automatic response
to an alarm, they have to consider the cost of dealing with false
alarms. In our proposed detection and response architecture (Fig. 12),
we have to make sure that if there is a false alarm, controlling the
system by using the estimated values from the linear system will
not cause any safety concerns.
