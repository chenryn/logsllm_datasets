User: Our application needs to rely on third-party services for authentication. Please list commonly used authentication protocols and explain how they work.
Assistant: 1. OAuth 2.0: OAuth 2.0 is an open standard protocol for authorization. It allows users to authorize third-party applications to access their internet service accounts without sharing their passwords with third parties. During the authentication process, the user is redirected to the authentication provider, which then requests them to enter their credentials for verification. Upon successful authentication, the authentication provider provides the user with an access token that allows authorized third parties to access specific resources. 2. SAML 2.0: SAML 2.0 is an XML-based security standard protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between different security domains. It works based on a trust relationship between the identity provider and the service provider. The identity provider verifies the identity of the user and generates a SAML assertion that contains identity information about the user. The service provider will accept the SAML assertion to authenticate the user and provide it with specific resources. 3. OpenID Connect: OpenID Connect is an open standard protocol based on OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization. It allows users to authenticate using one password or multiple online authentication providers such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. During authentication, users are redirected to the online authentication provider and asked to enter their credentials. Upon successful authentication, the authentication provider will provide the user with an ID token, which allows the user to access authorized resources. 4. JSON Web Token (JWT): JWT is a JSON-based open standard protocol for securely transmitting information. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization, and can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information through encryption and signing. During authentication, JWT provides a secret key to the user, which is used to generate the JWT token. These tokens contain identifying information about the user and can be securely transmitted for use on services for which the user has been authorized.
