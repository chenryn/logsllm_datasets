I might have found an issue with the junit reporting that especially appears
when the report gets imported to xray.  
I actually create a screenshot manually with a filename and type and also via
the automatic mode for the after hook.
the result ist that actually one file gets imported as screenshots.png(the
manual one) that can be opened within jira since at treats as an png file.
The screenshots that get created automaticly via the pw config just gets
imported as screenshot without the file ending and can not be opened then.
Also if I download them and set the file type i can not open them.
### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.32.2]
  * Operating System: [All, Windows 11, Ubuntu 20, macOS 13.2, etc.]
  * Browser: [All, Chromium, Firefox, WebKit]
  * Other info:
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Config file**
    // playwright.config.ts
    // JUnit reporter config for Xray
    const xrayOptions = {
      // Whether to add  with all annotations; default is false
      embedAnnotationsAsProperties: true,
      // By default, annotation is reported as .
      // These annotations are reported as value.
      textContentAnnotations: ['test_description'],
      // This will create a "testrun_evidence" property that contains all attachments. Each attachment is added as an inner  element.
      // Disables [[ATTACHMENT|path]] in the .
      embedAttachmentsAsProperty: 'testrun_evidence',
      // Where to put the report.
      outputFile: './xray-report.xml',
    };
    use: {
        screenshot: {mode: 'only-on-failure', fullPage: true},
    }
**Test file (self-contained)**
    it('do stuff', async ({ page }) => {
      await overviewPage.goto();
      const path = testInfo.outputPath('tmp_screenshot.png');
      await page.screenshot({path});
      testInfo.attachments.push({name: 'screenshot.png', path, contentType: 'image/png'});
      await overviewPage.selectSomething.click();
    });
**Steps**
  * [Run the test]
  * [...]
**Expected**
screenshots should be saved as "screenshot.png" since this is the default
filetype for screenshots
**Actual**
Only screenshots that are saved with the correct file ending will be converted
as an png by xray  
automatic screenshots get saved as "screenshot" and then can not be opened
(broken file)
