rates under a variety of scenarios in the experimental simulations, especially study of 
temporary  inconsistency  in  new  distributed  detection  architecture.  These  extensions 
are being developed under the cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture 
A Specification-Based Intrusion Detection Model for OLSR 
347 
proposed  in  [30].  Further  studies  of  distributed  detection  agents  on  all  nodes  and 
extension  of  authentication  techniques,  such  as  TESLA[7],  for  authentication  of 
forwarding messages is part of our ongoing work; this will enable us  to resolve the 
assumptions  in  this  model  and  enable  implementing  the  model  in  more  realistic 
platforms. 
7   Related Work  
Most IDS approaches for MANETs attempt to detect malicious packet dropping; this 
includes both routing and data packets. We describe these approaches briefly in this 
review,  since  this  intrusive  behavior  is  one  of  several  that  may  be  employed 
exclusively  on  routing  control  packets  to  disrupt  the  routing  within  a  MANET.  A 
general packet drop detector for MANETs is described in [18]. A statistical approach 
is  presented  by  Rao  and  Kesidis  in  [9]  using  estimated  congestion  at  intermediate 
nodes  to  make  decisions  about  malicious  packet  dropping  behavior  at  these  nodes. 
The work described in [1], [2], and [5] use the mechanism of assigning a value to the 
“reputation” of a node and using this information to weed out misbehaving nodes and 
use only trusted and verifiably good nodes. In [10], Ramanujan et al. present a system 
to  detect,  avoid  and  recover  from  malicious  attacks  on  ad  hoc  networks.  They  only 
focus  on  attacks  that  target  the  routing  function  within  these  networks.  Key  ideas 
include a distributed firewall mechanism to limit the impact of flooding, an algorithm 
to  detect  and  recover  from  intruder  induced  path  failures  and  a  wireless  router 
extension architecture.  
The case for a cooperative IDS architecture for mobile ad hoc networks was made 
first in [14] by Zhang and Lee. Anomaly detection is the primary intrusion detection 
approach discussed. Some details are provided for an anomaly detection model in the 
routing  updates.  In  more  recent  work  [3],  Huang  and  Lee  present  a  cooperative 
cluster-based  architecture.  We  note  that  the  architecture  is  designed  primarily  to 
support statistical anomaly detection. It is  unclear  how  statistical anomaly detection 
will  succeed  in  the  MANET  wireless  domain,  since  establishing  normative  profiles 
will  be  challenging  in  the  presence  of  dynamic  topologies,  noisy  and  intermittent 
wireless communications and a lack of concentration points where aggregated traffic 
can be analyzed.   Subhadhrabandhu, et al., [29] evaluate several selection strategies 
for placement of IDS  modules for misuse detection  within mobile ad hoc networks. 
Sterne et al. [30] present a cooperative intrusion detection architecture developed to 
address the unique challenges in the MANET domain. 
Several  approaches  address  the  issues  in  providing  secure  routing  in  MANETs. 
These 
include  cryptographic  approaches  as  well  as  IDS  approaches.  The 
cryptographic approaches [4], [7], [13], [11], [8] propose authentication protocols for 
the  routing  control  data  message  exchange  in  various  protocols.  Thus,  a  secure 
version  of  the  DSR  routing  protocol  is  proposed  in  Ariadne  [4]  using  the  TESLA 
authentication  protocol  [7].  Asymmetric  cryptography  is  proposed  in  [13]  to  secure 
the  AODV  routing  protocol.  The  ARAN  routing  protocol  [11]  using  certificates 
requires a trusted certificate authority. A secure link state routing for mobile ad hoc 
networks is proposed in [8], attaching certified keys to the link state updates flooded 
within a specified zone.

C.H. Tseng et al. 
The  IDS  approaches  attempt  to  detect  attacks  on  specific  routing  protocols.  In 
these approaches, the routing control messages are monitored employing a variety of 
IDS approaches for signs of intrusive behavior. Thus, in [17], Gwalami et al employ 
an  IDS  approach  that  is  based  on  a  stateful  analysis  of  the  data  of  AODV  control 
packet  streams  in  order  to  detect  intrusions.  This  approach  is  based  on  the  State 
Transition  Analysis  Technique  (STAT)  [24]  developed  initially  to  model  host  and 
network  based  intrusions  in  a  wired  environment.  In  the  current  implementation,  a 
sensor is deployed individually in each of a subset of nodes, and the sensors do not 
communicate  with each other. Analysis of insider attacks  on the  AODV protocol is 
presented in [6].  A formal specification of the AODV protocol is presented in [28]. 
This  is  used  to  detect  implementation  bugs  in  the  AODV  protocol.  A  specification 
based ID approach for monitoring the AODV routing protocol is proposed in [12].  
8   Conclusion 
Analyzing  the  OLSR  routing  specification,  we  define  the  normal  OLSR  routing 
behavior  and  list  possible  attack  mechanisms  from  a  single  attacker.  Based  on  the 
normal  routing  behavior,  nodes  retrieve  routing  information,  and  establish  and 
maintain their routing tables correctly using the Hello and TC messages. We develop 
constraints on these Hello and TC messages in order to establish that the integrity of 
the  routing  tables  at  all  nodes  is  not  compromised.  We  develop  the  proof  of 
satisfaction of the requirement that the integrity of routing tables of all nodes is safe-
guarded.  In  addition,  we  implement  the  constraints  and  example  attacks  on  the 
Glomosim simulation platform.  
In  future  work,  we  aim  to  implement  and  deploy  the  model  for  more  realistic 
MANET  scenarios.  Tasks  here  include  (i)  developing  a  message  exchange  model  to 
allow  distributed  detectors  to  have  required  minimum  local  routing  information  by 
exchanging  messages  between  local  detectors,  and  (ii)  enhance  the  model  to  ensure 
detectors  to  have  all  required  messages  and  deal  with  message  loss,  delay  and  false 
alarms. Additionally, we plan to add new constraints monitoring forwarding behavior of 
OLSR TC message forwarding and normal unicast packet forwarding. Our final goal is 
to deal with all assumptions of the model for the realistic implementation of the model.1
