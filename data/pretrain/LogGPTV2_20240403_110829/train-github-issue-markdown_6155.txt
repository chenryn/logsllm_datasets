### Problem
`rcParams["savefig.directory"]` sets the default directory used by the figure-
saving dialog. It is either a fixed firectory (defaulting to $HOME), or, if an
empty string, uses the current directory of the process. After saving a
figure, its value gets updated to the directory where _that_ figure was saved
(so if it starts at /foo/bar but you interactively select to save a figure as
/quux/baz.png, next time you click on the figure-saving icon the dialog will
start at /quux)... _except_ if the initial value is the empty string (i.e.,
the current directory) in which case later dialogs will _still_ start at the
current directory.
I have indeed set `savefig.directory` to be empty, as I quite often want to
save figures "close" to the script directory; however, if I want e.g. to put
multiple figures in the same subdirectory or sibling directory, then I need to
interactively do so for each figure, which is a lot of clicking.
### Proposed Solution
Hence, at least for this use case, it would be reasonable to always update
`savefig.directory` after an interactive save, even if its initial value is
empty. I guess this may (like always) break some workflows(?!) -- although
that seems slightly unlikely to me --, so we may possibly just put the
decision of whether to ever update that rcParam into yet another separate
rcParam (`savefig.update_directory_after_save`)... or we may decide it's not
worth that additional complexity unless someone actually complains ;-)
