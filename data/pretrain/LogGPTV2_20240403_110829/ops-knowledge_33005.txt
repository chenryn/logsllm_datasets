User: I have a server that I'd like to use to maintain persistent connections with a set of devices, just so that they can pass simple messages back and forth. It's a trivial task, but selecting a server-side platform has been suprrisingly difficult (especially since I have no administrative privileges - it's a dedicated commercial server).
My best idea so far is to write a TCP server in Python. The Twisted platform seems suitable for the task, and has a lot of good reviews. However, my server has Python 2.7 but not Twisted, and the admins have been reluctant to install it for me.
Is there any way that I can just upload a Twisted package to the server and reference it in my libraries without installing it as a framework?
Assistant: Use virtualenv to create your private Python libraries installation.
