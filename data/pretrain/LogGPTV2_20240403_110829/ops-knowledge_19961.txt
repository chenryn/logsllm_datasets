User:  How to configure Elasticsearch to support Chinese search?
Assistant: To enable Elasticsearch to support Chinese search, you need to configure the following three aspects: 1. Tokenizer: Chinese word segmentation is different from English word segmentation, and you need to use a Chinese tokenizer. Elasticsearch provides a variety of Chinese tokenizers to choose from, such as ik tokenizer (ik-analyzer), mmseg tokenizer, etc. When configuring the tokenizer, it is necessary to consider the impact of different tokenizers on the accuracy and efficiency of Chinese word segmentation. 2. Stop Words (Stop Words): Stop words refer to words that are ignored during the search process, such as "of", "is" and so on. Elasticsearch provides a default English stop word list, but for Chinese, you need to customize the stop word list to better support Chinese search. 3. Synonyms (Synonyms): There are many synonyms in Chinese, such as "mobile phone" and "telephone" can replace each other. Synonyms need to be configured in Elasticsearch so that related words can be matched when searching. The following is a simple example that demonstrates how to configure a Chinese tokenizer (ik-analyzer) and custom stop words and synonyms in Elasticsearch. 1. Install ik tokenizer Install ik-analyzer in Elasticsearch: ``` bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik/releases/download/v7.5.1/elasticsearch-analysis -ik-7.5.1.zip ``` 2. Configure the tokenizer In the Elasticsearch configuration file, add the following content: ``` index: analysis: analyzer: ik_smart: type: "custom" tokenizer: "ik_smart" ik_max_word: type: "custom" tokenizer: "ik_max_word" ``` Among them, ik_smart is an intelligent tokenizer that can divide the text according to the characteristics of the text; ik_max_word is a fine-grained tokenizer that can divide the text into smaller fragments. 3. Add stop words In Elasticsearch, you need to create a custom stop word list: ``` PUT /_stopwords { "stopwords": ["的", "了", "是", "我"] } ``` 4. Add synonyms In Elasticsearch, you need to create a custom synonym file, such as my_synonyms.txt: ``` mobile phone, phone, mobile phone, mobile phone phone ``` Then, in the configuration file of Elasticsearch, add The following: ``` index: analysis: filter: my_synonym_filter: type: "synonyms" synonyms_path: "path_to_my_synonyms.txt" analyzer: my_synonym_analyzer: type: "custom" tokenizer: "ik_smart" filter: ["my_synonyms_filter "] ``` In this way, when a user searches for "mobile phone", synonyms including "telephone", "mobile phone" and "mobile phone" will be automatically matched. The above is a simple example, you can configure it according to your specific needs.
