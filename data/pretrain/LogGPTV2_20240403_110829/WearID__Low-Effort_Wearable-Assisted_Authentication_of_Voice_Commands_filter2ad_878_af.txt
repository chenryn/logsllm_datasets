#### A.1 Difficulty of Comparing Microphone Data with Motion Sensor Data

Figure 2 illustrates the difficulty of comparing microphone data with motion sensor data. A participant speaks ten words to both a microphone and an accelerometer, and both data are re-sampled to the same sampling rate for similarity comparison. Figure 2(a) shows the time-domain correlation coefficient between the microphone-recorded sound (X-axis) and motion sensor data (Y-axis) by cross-comparing ten words. We observe that the correlations at the diagonal (i.e., same word sound) and non-diagonal (i.e., different word sounds) are indistinguishable. The results indicate that re-sampling and time-domain analysis are insufficient to address the similarity comparison of the two different sensing modalities. Figure 2(b), the CDF of the correlation coefficients, further depicts the challenge of matching the sound across the two domains, where the sound of the same word and those of different words all show low correlation values (i.e., less than 0.1). Thus, we need to investigate the inherent unique relationship between the two sensing modalities to facilitate their similarity comparison.

#### A.2 Examples of the Voice Commands

We evaluate WearID with 20 representative voice commands that involve highly sensitive information or functionalities. These voice commands could be used by an adversary to access sensitive information or functionalities. Specifically, the adversary could acquire private information (e.g., schedule, password, email, contact list) of users. With these voice commands, they may also conduct unauthorized purchases or manipulate smart home devices. Note that we use voice commands of different lengths to examine the generality of WearID.
