model, and chaos theory, the bottom line is, we live in a self-organizing creative
intelligent learning trial-and-error participatory interactive evolving universe. That’s
quite a different story than we had twenty years ago. And it sets the stage to say that life
has evolved everywhere the environmental conditions are correct. 
RT: If life can happen, it will happen. 
EM: Exactly. Much of 20th century science, like special relativity, limits on the speed of
light, dismissing non-locality as unimportant, all that is being challenged as just being
wrong. I think over the next few decades, we will discover the physics that allowed ETs
to get here. 
RT: You wrote a very strong endorsement of Paul Hill’s “Unconventional Flying
Objects: a scientific analysis” (Hampton Roads: 1995) which articulates a solid basis in
contemporary physics for understanding the propulsion systems of UFOs as observed and
reported. You wrote, “Paul Hill has done a masterful job ferreting out the basic science
and technology behind the elusive UFO characteristics and demonstrating they are just
advanced and exotic extensions of our own technologies.” 
EM: Yes. He was right on. He did a good study of the data. The data says things on
radiation, energy, he uses “force field,” we would call that zero-point energy field now,
but by and large he approached it correctly. He had very good data, categorized it and
evaluated it according to science as understood now. He said, we don’t have it yet but it’s
not outside the realm of science that we understand.
RT: What’s your sense at the age of seventy of where this is all headed? How will you be
thinking about this in five or ten years?
EM: In space I had an epiphany, an experience of the connectedness of everything. I later
came to understand it. It’s where you experience, see the separateness of things with your
physical eyes but experience the connectedness of all things in an altered state. From that
point on, life was never the same for me. I had to come out and find what these deep
issues are, recognizing that our scientific cosmology was incomplete and out religious
cosmologies archaic. I was looking for a new myth about ourselves, but by myth I mean
truth. 
For thirty years, we have been looking at connecting these dots and finding new dots to
connect to create the picture better. All of these changes in science, beginning with chaos
structure and special relativity and its limitations. and discovering what the devil
resonance means in terms of non locality, to me those are the key elements because they
bring consciousness into it. They bring the fact that information in the universe is not
limited by the speed of light and maybe nothing else is either. I think within the next
decade or so and probably within the next few years the real truth of this visitation we
have experienced will be uncovered. The momentum is building for that right now, very
strongly. Now, I always have to qualify my remarks by saying, I have no firsthand
experience with ET stuff or even UFO stuff so I have to preserve some wiggle room by
saying I could be totally wrong –
RT: But that’s the way it looks.
EM: That’s the way it looks at the moment. Our science in the 21st century will do very
shortly to Einstein and Pauli and Schroedinger what they did to Newton a hundred years
ago. Their science is great as far as it goes but it doesn’t go far enough.
RT: If it’s good science that has to happen.
EM: It has to happen. I think we’re ready for a major paradigm shift. We’re already
seeing it on the frontiers of science. Mainstream academicians are still stuck but it
doesn’t look like the Big Bang is the right answer. Hoyle’s most recent work, Halton
Arp’s most recent work, is powerfully damning to the Big Bang, which is a knee-jerk
reaction to the red shift. It’s just not right. So we have, it looks like, a whole new era of
science about to open up, provided that humanity can survive.
RT: Let me take the ET hypothesis one step further. Most of the people I talk to – various
individuals, never anyone on the record, but people who have had astonishing encounters,
air force pilots, commercial pilots, even some in the intelligence community say that
while what they are saying is not classified, they have talked to X off the record who
talked to Y – these people seem to generally articulate the same point of view on the
reality of UFO phenomena, the reality of visitation. But given what we know about
psychological operations and counter-intelligence, cover and deception, simulated
phenomena to cover technological advances, I can’t go any further that listening to what
they report and remaining agnostic. I don’t know how much is bumbling, or organized
forgetfulness, or confusion, or intentional disinformation.
EM: There is so much disinformation and misinformation that is deliberate. There is
clearly a covert attempt to disguise and debunk this information.
RT: So how do we know? How do we know what we know? What methodology, what
procedure would a reasonably intelligent guy follow to determine as clearly as he can
what is likely to be likely? 
EM: Richard, I can’t answer that question, only because I think in terms of chaotic
systems, systems in disequilibrium. When systems are far from equilibrium they are not
predictable and they can go any way, and this is a not-predictable system, it’s a pot
boiling, and exactly where it will break out and bubble over, no one has the answer to
that. It is going to be determined by the collective unconscious more than the plans of
whoever is trying to keep the lid on this. There’s no doubt that someone is trying to keep
the lid on it. Who that is, how it is, where it is, we only get glimmers. 
I have personally been told by a senior officer on a joint intelligence committee a few
years ago – all he would say, when asked the question, is there an organization still doing
all this? all we could get out of him was, a couple of weeks later, after he did some
checking, “Yes. You’re right.” That’s all he would say. 
I don’t know what much more we could do. What some of us are trying to do is get
congressional pressure put on it, but politicians are so politically sensitive about their
careers that not one in ten thousand will touch it. We tried and tried and almost got there
a few times and then they backed out. 
RT: At that point, you have no idea what they’re encountering in terms of resistance.
EM: No we don’t. We don’t know if someone came in the office and closed the door and
told them, shut your goddamn mouth or it’s peer pressure or election pressure or what. 
RT: Without triangulating data, you can’t know.
EM: No. All we can do is go on the preponderance of data and the preponderance of data
is so overwhelming that at least some portion of this activity is ET activity. A goodly
portion of it, it would now appear, is not ET activity. There are black programs where
they can emulate some of the so-called ET phenomenon. It appears they are doing it. But
when we’ve said these things, we can’t say them with a hundred per cent certainty. We’re
still guessing. It’s a terribly complex, difficult phenomena and there are a lot of people
opposed. The fundamentalist religious community recognizes that it will destroy
established religion as we have known it, if it comes out.
In my opinion, the theological structure that comes closest to what we’re seeing with
quantum holographic work is Tibetan Buddhism. It comes right out of shamanism and
Buddhism as it entered Tibet centuries ago. I consider the dispersed Tibetan scholars to
be some of the greatest scholars on consciousness studies that we have. Their notion of
spirit, reincarnation, etc., dovetails well with work in quantum holography. I lecture on
reincarnation and say that you can’t tell the difference in principle between an old soul
and a new soul with a long memory. You just tune into the collective unconsciousness,
and claim the memories as your own. From a therapeutic point of view it does not matter
what model or structure you use. If people trying to resolve early life trauma can pull out
of the collective unconscious information about an event that can help them understand
or heal their trauma, it doesn’t matter where it comes from. It’s irrelevant from the
therapeutic point of view but for those of us trying to articulate the new mythology
disguised as truth, it’s important.
RT: Explanations have to be congruent with the other pieces of our constructions of
reality. We’re trying to build a multi-faceted construction of reality now within which we
can have discourse like this. That’s challenging.
EM: Much of what happened to me that I would have liked to talk about, I have not
talked about for thirty years, because the culture had not moved far enough forward for it
even to compute. I would have sounded like a madman.
RT: Breakthrough ideas always sound crazy. You have to build bridges to others’
consensus reality so they can speak with you. 
EM: Exactly right. Thirty years ago, working with mystics and shamans, seeing what was
real … yes, it was real, but how do you fit it into a framework that matches the rest of
reality that we know about? 
If we could get the world’s leaders out there to look at the earth from deep space, we
would have a very different political system than the one we have.
In 1971, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, then a U.S. Navy Captain, became the sixth man to walk on the
moon. 
He is a scientist, test pilot, navel officer, astronaut, entrepreneur, author and lecturer. In
1973, he founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences to sponsor research in the nature of
consciousness. He is co-founder of the Association of Space Explorers, an international
organization founded in 1984 for all who share the experience of space travel.
He is author of The Way of the Explorer (Putnam, 1996) and Psychic Exploration: A
