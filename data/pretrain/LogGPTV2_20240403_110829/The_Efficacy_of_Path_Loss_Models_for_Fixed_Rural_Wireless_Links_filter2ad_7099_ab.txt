### Overall Model Performance

**Figure 2.** Overall model performance as described by (residual) root mean squared error (RMSE) and spread-corrected RMSE (SC-RMSE). The spread-corrected error is adjusted (reduced) by the expected measurement spread on a given link.

In this study, we do not place significant emphasis on coverage requirements because we observe that these are often not strictly adhered to in the literature. For instance, the Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain model is frequently used outside its intended coverage. In our analysis, both appropriate and "inappropriate" models are given an equal opportunity to make predictions for our network. We have no initial bias regarding which model should perform best.

### Results

The predicted received signal strength \( P_r \) is calculated using the following equation:

\[ P_r = P_t + G_t(\theta) + G_r(\phi) - \hat{L} \]

To obtain results, each model is asked to predict the median path loss for each link in our network. The model provides an estimate of the loss \( \hat{L} \), which is combined with known values to calculate the predicted received signal strength \( P_r \):

- \( G_t \) is the antenna gain of the transmitter in the azimuthal direction \( \theta \) of the receiver.
- \( G_r \) is the antenna gain of the receiver in the azimuthal direction \( \phi \) of the transmitter.
- These gains are derived from measured antenna patterns (one for each type of antenna).
- The transmit power \( P_t \) is set to 18 dBm for all nodes, which is the maximum transmit power of the Atheros radios used in our nodes.

For a given link, we calculate the median received signal strength value across all measurements (\( \bar{P_r} \)). The prediction error \( \epsilon \) is then the difference between the prediction and the median measured value: \( \epsilon = \bar{P_r} - P_r \).

Some models include tunable parameters of varying complexity. For these models, we test a range of reasonable parameter values without any preconceived notions about which will perform best. To conserve space, the following discussion and figures present results from only the 27 best-performing models/configurations.

**Figure 2** provides the overall performance of each algorithm in terms of its RMSE. To account for underlying variance in the measurements, we use a "spread-corrected" RMSE (\( \hat{\epsilon} \)), where the link's measured standard deviation (\( \bar{\sigma} \)) is subtracted from the prediction error: \( \hat{\epsilon} = |\epsilon| - \bar{\sigma} \). This corrected RMSE gives an idea of the error in excess of the expected variance due to temporal variation (e.g., fast-fading and intrinsic/diurnal periodicity).

The best-performing models achieve an RMSE on the order of 15 dB. Specifically:
- The Alsebrook model (with its terrain roughness parameter set to 200m) has an RMSE of just under 18 dB (16.7 dB when corrected).
- The Flat-Edge model (with 10 "buildings" presumed) has an RMSE of 16.5 dB (15.3 dB when corrected).

**Figure 3** provides two domain-oriented metrics that describe models' competitive and individual "goodness":
- **Competitive metric**: The percentage of links for which a given model produces the best prediction. No single model dominates; the best predictions are spread fairly evenly among half a dozen models, each achieving the best prediction between 10 and 15 percent of the time.
- **Individual metric**: The percentage of links for which a given model's prediction is within the expected spread (measurement standard deviation). The best-performing models are "correct" 10% of the time using this metric. If we lower the bar to making a prediction within two standard deviations of the measured median value, the best-performing models (Egli, Friis (with \( \alpha = 2 \)), Flat-Edge, ITM, ITU Terrain, and Two-Ray) achieve between 10 and 15% correct.

**Figure 4** plots our next metric: the ability to order links. In some applications, it may be sufficient for a propagation model to order two or more links by strength. Here, we plot Spearman's non-parametric rank order coefficient \( \rho \) for each model. For this metric, a value of 0.45 indicates a strong positive correlation.

**Note:**
- Although we correct for measurement variation, it is generally small: 1.31 dB median standard deviation and 1.67 dB at the third quantile.
- Some models, such as the ITM, perform substantially better when considering only the fraction of cases within their intended coverage. For example, the ITM has a competitive spread-corrected RMSE of 17.3 dB when only error-free predictions are considered.
