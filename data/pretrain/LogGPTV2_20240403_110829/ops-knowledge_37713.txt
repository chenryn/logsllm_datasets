User: I want to use the macports version of python instead of the one that comes with Leopard.
Assistant: Instead of uninstalling the built-in Python, install the MacPorts version and then modify your $PATH to have the MacPorts version first.
For example, if MacPorts installs /usr/local/bin/python, then modify your .bashrc to include PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH at the end.
