# Environment
Windows build number: 10.0.18362  
Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.6.2951.0  
Powershell Version: 5.1.18362.145
# Steps to reproduce
Enter a PS Session, run some command that will cause the output to scroll past
the bottom of the terminal window (for example, Get-Process), exit the PS
Session, enter "clear" or "clear-host", then scroll up. Part of the output
from the command run in the PS Session will still be present in the scrollback
buffer and cannot be removed or cleared without closing the tab.
Example in code:
    Enter-PSSession 1.1.1.1
    for($i = 0; $i -lt 150; $i++){write-host $i} 
    exit
    clear-host
    #scroll up in the terminal window
The attached screenshot shows the contents of my scrollback buffer after
running similar code and then running a clear-output command. You can see the
output of the commands and the numbers 0-13 present in the scrollback buffer,
as in my particular case the code caused the output window to scroll down 15
lines while in the PS Session. At this point clear and clear-host will not be
able to remove these 15 lines of output from the Scrollback Buffer.

Oddly enough it seems the issue is the same even if you run a "clear-host"
while still inside of the PS Session. But running a "clear-host" while inside
the PS Session _does_ work as long as the output hasn't caused the terminal
window to scroll.
# Expected behavior
Entering a "clear" or "clear-host" command in PowerShell should clear the
terminal window, including clearing the scrollback buffer of all output. This
is the functionality of the cmdlet if running from a cmd window, the
PowerShell app, and PS ISE.
# Actual behavior
When using the Windows Terminal to enter a PS session with another host, if
the output from that session causes the terminal output to scroll down, upon
exiting that PS Session and running a "clear" or "clear-host" command will not
clear the first portion of the output from the PS session, equal to the number
of lines that the ps session caused the window to scroll down.
# Other notes
I've tested this with PowerShell 5.1 in Windows 10 from the PowerShell app,
cmdhost running powershell, and from PS ISE , it does not seem to occur in any
other circumstances outside of the Windows Terminal, so I'm opening this as a
Windows Terminal bug. It's not critical, but pretty annoying if doing remote
PowerShell work.
