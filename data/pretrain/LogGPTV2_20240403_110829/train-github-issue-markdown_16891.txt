My apologies if this is the wrong venue. It wasn't clear from the contributors
guidelines whether issues are a suitable place for questions/feature-requests,
and when I asked via the community chat room and the usual places I didn't get
much engagement.
Does Deno have a supported-or-experimental way to track the creation of
asynchronous contexts? I see async_hooks isn't something you'll be
implementing -- at least until Node lands a non-experimental version of it.
The specific use-case I have in mind is an OpenTelementry context manager, but
I'm also thinking of other Application Performance Monitoring use-cases where
we're trying to tie multiple asynchronous actions to a single scope (scope
meaning a single HTTP request, or a single GRPC method invocation, etc.)
Also, FWIW, the usual cowboy way APM vendors would handle this doesn't look
like it's possible in Deno -- redefining the global `Promise` doesn't carry
over when you `import` other modules. Probably "the right" behavior, but it
does seem to make our usual monkey patching not possible.
Is this something that's on the roadmap and/or people's minds? "No" is a
perfectly acceptable answer, I'm just trying to get the lay of the land before
I go down one particular road or the other.
