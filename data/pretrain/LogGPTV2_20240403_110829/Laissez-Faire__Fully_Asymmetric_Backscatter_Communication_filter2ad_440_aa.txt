### Introduction
Good morning. I am Pan Hu from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In this talk, I will discuss Laissez Faire Backscatter, a fully asymmetric backscatter communication system.

### Communication vs. Sensing Gap

**Power Consumption Comparison:**
- **Communication:** WiFi, Zigbee, BLE, UWB
- **Sensing:** Camera (Stonyman), ECG, Microphone, Accelerometer

The power consumption of low-power radios is significantly higher than that of typical sensors. For instance, while many sensors can operate at less than 1 milliwatt, radio interfaces consume thousands of times more power, making communication a major bottleneck for low-power operation.

### Bridging the Gap with Backscatter

**Backscatter Technology:**
- **Active Radios:** Power-hungry due to symmetric design, requiring components like RF synthesizers, mixers, and amplifiers.
- **Backscatter:** Asymmetric design where the reader is powerful and the tag is minimalistic, using only one transistor to modulate the carrier wave sent by the reader.

### Energy vs. Spectrum Tradeoff

**Design Considerations:**
- **Energy Efficiency:** Minimizing power consumption.
- **Spectrum Efficiency:** Maximizing the use of available spectrum.

Two configurations are possible:
1. **Match RF Bitrate to Sensor Sampling Rate:**
   - **Advantages:** Low power consumption, smaller data and energy buffers.
   - **Disadvantages:** Low spectrum utilization.

2. **Match Bitrate to Available Spectrum:**
   - **Advantages:** High spectrum utilization.
   - **Disadvantages:** Higher power consumption, larger data and energy buffers.

### Multiple Access Protocols

**TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access):**
- **Operation:** Divides time into slots, each tag transmits in its assigned slot.
- **Advantages:** Good energy efficiency.
- **Disadvantages:** Low spectrum efficiency, especially with slow tags.

**CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access):**
- **Operation:** Expands each bit into multiple bits using a pseudo-random code.
- **Advantages:** High spectrum efficiency.
- **Disadvantages:** Sacrifices power efficiency due to the need for encoding and decoding.

### Conclusion

Laissez Faire Backscatter leverages the asymmetric nature of backscatter communication to bridge the gap between high-power radios and low-power sensors. By carefully designing the protocols, we can achieve a balance between energy and spectrum efficiency, enabling efficient and scalable wireless communication for low-power applications.
