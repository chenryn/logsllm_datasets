Radio: major bottleneck for low-power operation

As we all know, low power radios like Bluetooth low energy are crucial for a variety of applications, from wearables to internet of things.
But these radios are not as low power as they seem to be. These radios are advertised as extremely low power and this is true if they are heavily duty-cycled, say 1% of the time. But during the process of active 
transmission and reception, they consume roughly 20mW, which is a non-trivial amount of power. This “active mode power” hurts us when it comes to streaming data continuously from sensors. 
This graph shows the power consumption of low power radios versus typical sensors. The y-axis is in log-scale. 
If you look at trends in low-power sensors, you will see that many sensors, even high-rate ones like MEMS accelerometers, microphones, ECG, and even cameras can operate lower than a milliwatt, sometimes only 
several micro-watts in active mode. In contrast, the radio interface consumes thousands of times more power than the sensor itself. In this case communication becomes a major bottleneck for low power 
operation.

Backscatter can bridge the gap!
A promising technology to bridge this gap is backscatter communication.  To explain why backscatter can do it, let me analysis why active radio consumes so much.

Active radios are often designed in a symmetric manner where both the transmitter and receiver generate the carrier and the baseband. This means that each end has radio frequency synthesizers, mixers, low 
noise ampliﬁers and power ampliﬁers which contributes to the high power consumption when the radio is on. Adding all these components up, the total power will exceed 20mW.

In contrast, backscatter is designed in an asymmetric manner.  Usually the backscatter reader is much more powerful than the tag. Instead of having power-hungry components at the tag side,

How is this possible? Let me explain it. Instead of sending information from the backscatter tag to the reader directly, the reader ﬁrst send an unmodulated carrier wave to the tag.

At the tag side,  instead of generating the RF carrier wave directly which usually consumes more than 20mW, it just modulation information on top of the carrier sent by the reader. This can be done by 
using a transistor to modulate the status of the antenna, which consumes about 20uW.

Energy v.s. Spectrum Tradeoﬀ
Energy Efﬁciency
Spectrum Efﬁciency
Given we have a power-efficient radio, we need to design protocols very carefully so that they retain the power beneﬁts of backscatter. One important design consideration in backscatter is the trade 
off between energy  and spectrum efficiency.

We illustrate the example with two conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst conﬁguration is that, we can match the Backscatter data rate to the sampling rate of sensors.

In the ﬁrst conﬁguration, data is being streamed as and when it is generated by the sensor, for example a microphone connected to a backscatter radio. In this case, the baseband clock is matched to the sensor 
sampling rate, which is good since a lower rate baseband clock consumes less power.

and each tag choose a time slot to transmit. Here, slower operation is clearly inefficient since slow tags will need large slots to transmit their bits. This will hurt other tags that can transmit faster.
