ABSTRACT 
Across  a  range  of  subfields,  computer  scientists  and 
engineers  have  responded  to  society’s  call  to  safeguard 
privacy through technology, yielding scientific progress and 
impressive innovation. As the fields of privacy science and 
engineering mature, however, it’s worth taking a moment to 
ask  what  ideas  of  privacy  explicitly  or  implicitly  underlie 
this work and whether they are meaningful, that is to say, 
whether  they  map  onto  ideas  of  privacy  that  provoked 
societal concerns, in the first place. If not, it is unclear, at 
best, what ends these scientific efforts are actually serving. 
In my lecture, I argue that privacy as Contextual Integrity 
(CI)  is  meaningful  in  this  sense  –  philosophically  sound 
while being accessible to formal representation. As such, CI 
could  serve  as  a  much-needed  a  bridge  between  technical 
approaches  and  ethical  and  policy  approaches.  I  will 
identify  promising  directions  for  future  work  based  on 
interesting  technical  applications  of  CI  that  have  already 
emerged.
