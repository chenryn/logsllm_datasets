In this use case, the PE/PA(s) is often hosted as a cloud service (which usually provides superior 
availability and would not require remote workers to rely on enterprise infrastructure to access 
cloud resources) with end assets having an installed agent (see Section 3.2.1) or accessing a 
resource portal (see Section 3.2.3). It may not be most responsive to have the PE/PA(s) hosted on 
the enterprise local network as remote offices and workers must send all traffic back to the 
enterprise network to reach applications/services hosted by cloud services.

4.2 
Multi-cloud/Cloud-to-Cloud Enterprise 
One increasingly common use case for deploying a ZTA is an enterprise utilizing multiple cloud 
providers (see Figure 9). In this use case, the enterprise has a local network but uses two or more 
cloud service providers to host applications/services and data. Sometimes, the application/service 
is hosted on a cloud service that is separate from the data source. For performance and ease of 
management, the application hosted in Cloud Provider A should be able to connect directly to the 
data source hosted in Cloud Provider B rather than force the application to tunnel back through 
the enterprise network. 
Figure 9: Multi-cloud Use Case 
This use case is the server-server implementation of the CSA’s software defined perimeter (SDP) 
specification [CSA-SDP]. As enterprises move to more cloud-hosted applications and services, it 
becomes apparent that relying on the enterprise perimeter for security becomes a liability. As 
discussed in Section 2.2, ZT principles take the view that there should be no difference between 
enterprise-owned and -operated network infrastructure and infrastructure owned and operated by 
any other service provider. The zero trust approach to multi-cloud use is to place PEPs at the 
NIST SP 800-207

access points of each application/service and data source. The PE and PA may be services 
located in either cloud or even on a third cloud provider. The client (via a portal or local installed 
agent) then accesses the PEPs directly. That way, the enterprise can still manage access to 
resources even when hosted outside the enterprise. One challenge is that different cloud 
providers have unique ways of implementing similar functionality. Enterprise architects will 
need to be aware of the how to implement their enterprise ZTA with each cloud provider they 
utilize. 
4.3 
Enterprise with Contracted Services and/or Nonemployee Access 
Another common scenario is an enterprise that includes on-site visitors and/or contracted service 
providers that require limited access to enterprise resources to do their work (see Figure 10). For 
example, an enterprise has its own internal applications/services, databases, and assets. These 
include services contracted out to providers who may occasionally be on-site to provide 
maintenance (e.g., smart heating and lighting systems that are owned and managed by external 
providers). These visitors and service providers will need network connectivity to perform their 
tasks. A zero trust enterprise could facilitate this by allowing these devices and any visiting 
service technician access to the internet while obscuring enterprise resources.  
Figure 10: Enterprise with Nonemployee Access 
In this example, the organization also has a conference center where visitors interact with 
employees. Again, with a ZTA approach of SDPs, employee devices and subjects are 
differentiated and may be able to access appropriate enterprise resources. Visitors to the campus 
can have internet access but cannot access enterprise resources. They may not even be able to

discover enterprise services via network scans (i.e., prevent active network reconnaissance/east-
west movement). 
In this use case, the PE(s) and PA(s) could be hosted as a cloud service or on the LAN (assuming 
little or no use of cloud-hosted services). The enterprise assets could have an installed agent (see 
Section 3.2.1) or access resources via a portal (see Section 3.2.3). The PA(s) ensures that all 
nonenterprise assets (those that do not have installed agents or cannot connect to a portal) cannot 
access local resources but may access the internet. 
4.4 
Collaboration Across Enterprise Boundaries 
A fourth use case is cross-enterprise collaboration. For example, there is a project involving 
employees from Enterprise A and Enterprise B (see Figure 11). The two enterprises may be 
separate federal agencies (G2G) or even a federal agency and a private enterprise (G2B). 
Enterprise A operates the database used for the project but must allow access to the data for 
certain members of Enterprise B. Enterprise A can set up specialized accounts for the employees 
of Enterprise B to access the required data and deny access to all other resources, but this can 
quickly become difficult to manage. Having both organizations enrolled in a federated ID 
management system would allow quicker establishment of these relationships provided that both 
organizations’ PEPs can authenticate subjects in a federated ID community.   
Figure 11: Cross-Enterprise Collaboration 
This scenario can be similar to Use Case 1 (Section 4.1) as employees of both enterprises may 
not be located on their organizations’ network infrastructures, and the resource they need to 
access may be within one enterprise environment or hosted in the cloud. This means that there do 
not need to be complex firewall rules or enterprise-wide access control lists (ACLs) allowing 
certain IP addresses belonging to Enterprise B to access resources in Enterprise A based on 
Enterprise A’s access policies. How this access is accomplished depends on the technology in 
use. Similar to Use Case 1, a PE and PA hosted as a cloud service may provide availability to all 
parties without having to establish a VPN or similar. The employees of Enterprise B may be 
asked to install a software agent on their asset or access the necessary data resources through a 
web gateway (see Section 3.2.3).

4.5 
Enterprise with Public- or Customer-Facing Services 
A common feature in many enterprises is a public-facing service that may or may not include 
user registration (i.e., users must create or have been issued a set of login credentials). Such 
services could be for the general public, a set of customers with an existing business relationship, 
or a special set of nonenterprise users such as employee dependents. In all cases, it is likely that 
requesting assets are not enterprise-owned, and the enterprise is constrained as to what internal 
cybersecurity polices can be enforced. 
For a general, public-facing resource that does not require login credentials to access (e.g., public 
web page), the tenets of ZTA do not directly apply. The enterprise cannot strictly control the 
state of requesting assets, and anonymous public resources (e.g., a public web page) do not 
require credentials in order to be accessed.   
Enterprises may establish policies for registered public users such as customers (i.e., those with a 
business relationship) and special users (e.g., employee dependents). If the users are required to 
produce or are issued credentials, the enterprise may institute policies regarding password length, 
life cycle, and other details and may provide MFA as an option or requirement. However, 
enterprises are limited in the policies they can implement for this class of user. Information about 
incoming requests may be useful in determining the state of the public service and detecting 
possible attacks masquerading as legitimate users. For example, a registered user portal is known 
to be accessed by registered customers using one of a set of common web browsers. A sudden 
increase in access requests from unknown browser types or known outdated versions could 
indicate an automated attack of some kind, and the enterprise could take steps to limit requests 
from these identified clients. The enterprise should also be aware of any statutes or regulations 
regarding what information can be collected and recorded about the requesting users and assets.

Threats Associated with Zero Trust Architecture 
No enterprise can eliminate cybersecurity risk. When complemented with existing cybersecurity 
policies and guidance, identity and access management, continuous monitoring, and general 
cyber hygiene, a properly implemented and maintained ZTA can reduce overall risk and protect 
against common threats. However, some threats have unique features when implementing a 
ZTA. 
5.1 
Subversion of ZTA Decision Process 
In ZTA, the policy engine and policy administrator are the key components of the entire 
enterprise. No communication between enterprise resources occurs unless it is approved and 
possibly configured by the PE and PA. This means that these components must be properly 
configured and maintained. Any enterprise administrator with configuration access to the PE’s 
rules may be able to perform unapproved changes or make mistakes that can disrupt enterprise 
operations. Likewise, a compromised PA could allow access to resources that would otherwise 
not be approved (e.g., to a subverted, personally-owned device). Mitigating associated risks 
means the PE and PA components must be properly configured and monitored, and any 
configuration changes must be logged and subject to audit.  
5.2 
Denial-of-Service or Network Disruption 
In ZTA, the PA is the key component for resource access. Enterprise resources cannot connect to 
each other without the PA’s permission and, possibly, configuration action. If an attacker 
disrupts or denies access to the PEP(s) or PE/PA (i.e., DoS attack or route hijack), it can 
adversely impact enterprise operations. Enterprises can mitigate this threat by having the policy 
enforcement reside in a properly secured cloud environment or be replicated in several locations 
following guidance on cyber resiliency [SP 800-160v2]. 
This mitigates the risk but does not eliminate it. Botnets such as Mirai produce massive DoS 
attacks against key internet service providers and disrupt service to millions of internet users.5 It 
is also possible that an attacker could intercept and block traffic to a PEP or PA from a portion or 
all of the user accounts within an enterprise (e.g., a branch office or even a single remote 
employee). In such cases, only a portion of enterprise subjects is affected. This is also possible in 
legacy remote-access VPNs and is not unique to ZTA.  
A hosting provider may also accidentally take a cloud-based PE or PA offline. Cloud services 
have experienced disruptions in the past, both infrastructure as a service (IaaS)6 and SaaS.7 An 
operational error could prevent an entire enterprise from functioning if the policy engine or 
policy administrator component becomes inaccessible from the network.

There is also the risk that enterprise resources may not be reachable from the PA, so even if 
access is granted to a subject, the PA cannot configure the communication path from the 
network. This could happen due to a DDoS attack or simply due to unexpected heavy usage. This 
is similar to any other network disruption in that some or all enterprise subjects cannot access a 
particular resource due to that resource not being available for some reason. 
5.3 
Stolen Credentials/Insider Threat 
Properly implemented ZT, information security and resiliency policies, and best practices reduce 
the risk of an attacker gaining broad access via stolen credentials or insider attack. The ZT 
principle of no implicit trust based on network location means attackers need to compromise an 
existing account or device to gain a foothold in an enterprise. A properly developed and 
implemented ZTA should prevent a compromised account or asset from accessing resources 
outside its normal purview or access patterns. This means that accounts with access policies 
around resources that an attacker is interested in would be the primary targets for attackers.  
Attackers may use phishing, social engineering, or a combination of attacks to obtain credentials 
of valuable accounts. “Valuable” may mean different things based on the attacker’s motivation. 
For instance, enterprise administrator accounts may be valuable, but attackers interested in 
financial gain may consider accounts that have access to financial or payment resources of equal 
value. Implementation of MFA for access requests may reduce the risk of information loss from 
a compromised account. However, an attacker with valid credentials (or a malicious insider) may 
still be able to access resources for which the account has been granted access. For example, an 
attacker or compromised employee who has the credentials and enterprise-owned asset of a valid 
human resources employee may still be able to access an employee database.   
ZTA reduces risk and prevents any compromised accounts or assets from moving laterally 
throughout the network. If the compromised credentials are not authorized to access a particular 
resource, they will continue to be denied access to that resource. In addition, a contextual trust 
algorithm (see Section 3.3.1) is more likely to detect and respond quickly to this attack than 
when occurring in a legacy, perimeter-based network. The contextual TA can detect access 
patterns that are out of normal behavior and deny the compromised account or insider threat 
access to sensitive resources.  
5.4 
Visibility on the Network 
As mentioned in Section 3.4.1, all traffic is inspected and logged on the network and analyzed to 
identify and react to potential attacks against the enterprise. However, as also mentioned, some 
(possibly the majority) of the traffic on the enterprise network may be opaque to layer 3 network 
analysis tools. This traffic may originate from nonenterprise-owned assets (e.g., contracted 
services that use the enterprise infrastructure to access the internet) or applications/services that 
are resistant to passive monitoring. The enterprise that cannot perform deep packet inspection or 
examine the encrypted traffic and must use other methods to assess a possible attacker on the 
network.  
That does not mean that the enterprise is unable to analyze encrypted traffic that it sees on the 
network. The enterprise can collect metadata (e.g., source and destination addresses, etc.) about 
NIST SP 800-207

30 
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-207 
the encrypted traffic and use that to detect an active attacker or possible malware communicating 
on the network. Machine learning techniques [Anderson] can be used to analyze traffic that 
cannot be decrypted and examined. Employing this type of machine learning would allow the 
enterprise to categorize traffic as valid or possibly malicious and subject to remediation.  
5.5 
Storage of System and Network Information 
A related threat to enterprise monitoring and analysis of network traffic is the analysis 
component itself. If monitor scans, network traffic, and metadata are being stored for building 
contextual policies, forensics, or later analysis, that data becomes a target for attackers. Just like 
network diagrams, configuration files, and other assorted network architecture documents, these 
resources should be protected. If an attacker can successfully gain access to this information, 
they may be able to gain insight into the enterprise architecture and identify assets for further 
reconnaissance and attack. 
Another source of reconnaissance information for an attacker in a ZT enterprise is the 
management tool used to encode access policies. Like stored traffic, this component contains 
access policies to resources and can give an attacker information on which accounts are most 
valuable to compromise (e.g., the ones that have access to the desired data resources). 
As for all valuable enterprise data, adequate protections should be in place to prevent 
unauthorized access and access attempts. As these resources are vital to security, they should 
have the most restrictive access policies and be accessible only from designated or dedicated 
administrator accounts. 
5.6 
Reliance on Proprietary Data Formats or Solutions 
ZTA relies on several different data sources to make access decisions, including information 
about the requesting subject, asset used, enterprise and external intelligence, and threat analysis. 
Often, the assets used to store and process this information do not have a common, open standard 
on how to interact and exchange information. This can lead to instances where an enterprise is 
locked into a subset of providers due to interoperability issues. If one provider has a security 
issue or disruption, an enterprise may not be able to migrate to a new provider without extreme 
cost (e.g., replacing several assets) or going through a long transition program (e.g., translating 
policy rules from one proprietary format to another). Like DoS attacks, this risk is not unique to 
ZTA, but because ZTA is heavily dependent on the dynamic access of information (both 
enterprise and service providers), disruption can affect the core business functions of an 
enterprise. To mitigate associated risks, enterprises should evaluate service providers on a 
holistic basis by considering factors such as vendor security controls, enterprise switching costs, 
and supply chain risk management in addition to more typical factors such as performance, 
stability, etc. 
5.7 
Use of Non-person Entities (NPE) in ZTA Administration 
Artificial intelligence and other software-based agents are being deployed to manage security 
issues on enterprise networks. These components need to interact with the management 
components of ZTA (e.g., policy engine, policy administrator), sometimes in lieu of a human 
administrator. How these components authenticate themselves in an enterprise implementing a 
NIST SP 800-207 
ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE 
31 
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-207 
ZTA is an open issue. It is assumed that most automated technology systems will use some 
means to authenticate when using an API to resource components.   
The biggest risk when using automated technology for configuration and policy enforcement is 
the possibility of false positives (innocuous actions mistaken for attacks) and false negatives 
(attacks mistaken for normal activity) impacting the security posture of the enterprise. This can 
be reduced with regular retuning analysis to correct mistaken decisions and improve the decision 
process.  
The associated risk is that an attacker will be able to induce or coerce an NPE to perform some 
task that the attacker is not privileged to perform. The software agent may have a lower bar for 
authentication (e.g., API key versus MFA) to perform administrative or security-related tasks 
compared with a human user. If an attacker can interact with the agent, they could theoretically 
trick the agent into allowing the attacker greater access or into performing some task on behalf of 
the attacker. There is also a risk that an attacker could gain access to a software agent’s 
credentials and impersonate the agent when performing tasks.
