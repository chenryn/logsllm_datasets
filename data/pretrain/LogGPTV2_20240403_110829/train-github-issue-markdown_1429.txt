It appears that the `dbpedia_csv.tar.gz` file you downloaded is corrupted, and the provided link for the dataset—
<https://googledrive.com/host/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M/dbpedia_csv.tar.gz>—is returning a 404 error. Although the file seems to have been downloaded (with a size of 1657 bytes), an error occurs when attempting to run the `text_classification_cnn.py` script from the TensorFlow examples.

Here’s the error message you received:

```

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Verify the Download Link**:
   - The original link is no longer valid. You should check if there is an updated or alternative source for the `dbpedia_csv.tar.gz` dataset. The TensorFlow GitHub repository or other data repositories might have the correct link.

2. **Download the Dataset Again**:
   - Once you have the correct link, download the dataset again and ensure it is not corrupted. You can use tools like `curl` or `wget` to download the file and verify its integrity using checksums if available.

3. **Check the File Size**:
   - A 1657-byte file is likely incorrect. The expected size of the `dbpedia_csv.tar.gz` file should be much larger. Ensure the file size matches the expected size after downloading.

4. **Run the Script Again**:
   - After ensuring the file is correctly downloaded and not corrupted, try running the `text_classification_cnn.py` script again.
