User: How to Realize System Resource Utilization Monitoring of Linux System?
Assistant: Under the Linux system, the following methods can be used to monitor the utilization of system resources: 1. top command: It can display the resource usage of running processes, including CPU usage, memory usage, I/O operations, etc. 2. htop command: Similar to the top command, but with a more friendly interface, it can display the process occupancy status more intuitively. 3. vmstat command: It can monitor the usage of memory, CPU, disk and other resources, and also display the historical data of system usage. 4. sar command: Real-time monitoring of system resources can be realized. After data statistics, the statistical results will be stored in files for later analysis and query. 5. iostat command: It can monitor disk performance indicators, including disk read and write speed, disk I/O load, etc. 6. Free command: It can display the memory usage of the system, including physical memory, swap space, etc. The above commands can be used by entering commands in the terminal, or combined with other tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, etc. for data display and monitoring.
