User: Is it possible to launch a command line prompt from pycharm that has all the environment variables set already (IE PYTHONPATH) for my projects custom environment.
Assistant: If you go to Run -> Edit Configurations in PyCharm, this will let you set CLI arguments, and there's also a couple of different PYTHONPATH-related fields (Add content roots to PYTHONPATH, Add source roots to PYTHONPATH).  You can also right-click a folder under the Project menu and check Mark as Sources Root - which I believe adds this directory to the PYTHONPATH at PyCharm script run-time.
Also, like metsfansaid, you could create a batch file to populate your Windows PYTHONPATH environmental variables prior to running anything in the new environment.  I believe PyCharm will inherit those.
