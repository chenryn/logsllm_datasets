**Is it possible to launch a command line prompt from PyCharm that has all the environment variables, such as `PYTHONPATH`, already set for my project's custom environment?**

Yes, you can configure PyCharm to launch a command line prompt with the necessary environment variables set. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Configure Run/Debug Configurations:**
   - Go to `Run` > `Edit Configurations` in PyCharm.
   - In the `Run/Debug Configurations` dialog, you can set the command-line arguments and modify the `PYTHONPATH`-related settings.
   - There are options to add content roots and source roots to the `PYTHONPATH`. You can enable these by checking the boxes for "Add content roots to PYTHONPATH" and "Add source roots to PYTHONPATH."

2. **Mark Directories as Sources Root:**
   - Right-click on a folder in the `Project` view and select `Mark Directory as` > `Sources Root`.
   - This action will include the selected directory in the `PYTHONPATH` when running scripts in PyCharm.

3. **Using a Batch File (for Windows):**
   - Create a batch file (e.g., `set_env.bat`) that sets the `PYTHONPATH` and other environment variables.
   - For example:
     ```batch
     @echo off
     set PYTHONPATH=C:\path\to\your\project;C:\path\to\other\libraries
     ```

   - Run this batch file before launching your project in PyCharm. PyCharm should inherit the environment variables set by the batch file.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your command line prompt in PyCharm is configured with the correct environment variables, including `PYTHONPATH`, for your project's custom environment.
