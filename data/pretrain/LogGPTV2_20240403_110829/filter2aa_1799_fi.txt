Relocates an automatically selected NUMA 
node’s physical memory to the specified 
physical address.
targetname
String
DEBUGGER_USB
_TARGETNAME
Defines the target name for the USB debug-
ger when used with USB2 or USB3 debug-
ging (debugtype is set to USB).
testsigning
Boolean
ALLOW_PRERELEASE
_SIGNATURES
Enables test-signing mode, which allows 
driver developers to load locally signed 
64-bit drivers. This option results in a water-
marked desktop.
truncatememory
Address in bytes
TRUNCATE_PHYSICAL
_MEMORY
Disregards physical memory above the 
specified physical address.
2 All the BCD elements codes for Boot Applications start with BCDE_LIBRARY_TYPE, but that has been omitted due to limited space.

Values
BCD Element Code3
Meaning
bootlog
Boolean
LOG_INITIALIZATION
Causes Windows to write a log of the boot to 
the file %SystemRoot%\Ntbtlog.txt.
bootstatuspolicy
DisplayAllFailures, 
ignoreAllFailures, 
IgnoreShutdownFailures, 
IgnoreBootFailures
BOOT_STATUS_POLICY
Overrides the system’s default behavior of 
offering the user a troubleshooting boot 
menu if the system didn’t complete the pre-
vious boot or shutdown.
bootux
Disabled, Basic, Standard
BOOTUX_POLICY
Defines the boot graphics user experience 
that the user will see. Disabled means that 
no graphics will be seen during boot time 
(only a black screen), while Basic will display 
only a progress bar during load. Standard 
displays the usual Windows logo animation 
during boot.
bootmenupolicy
Legacy
Standard
BOOT_MENU_POLICY
Specify the type of boot menu to show in 
case of multiple boot entries (see “The boot 
menu” section later in this chapter).
clustermodeaddressing
Number of processors
CLUSTERMODE
_ADDRESSING
Defines the maximum number of processors 
to include in a single Advanced Programmable 
Interrupt Controller (APIC) cluster.
configflags
Flags
PROCESSOR_
CONFIGURATION_FLAGS
Specifies processor-specific configuration 
flags.

BCD Element
Values
BCD Element Code3
Meaning
dbgtransport
Transport image name
DBG_TRANSPORT_PATH
Overrides using one of the default kernel 
debugging transports (Kdcom.dll, Kd1394, 
Kdusb.dll) and instead uses the given file, 
permitting specialized debugging transports 
to be used that are not typically supported 
by Windows.
debug
Boolean
KERNEL_DEBUGGER
_ENABLED
Enables kernel-mode debugging.
detecthal
Boolean
DETECT_KERNEL_AND
_HAL
Enables the dynamic detection of the HAL.
driverloadfailurepolicy
Fatal, UseErrorControl
DRIVER_LOAD_FAILURE
_POLICY
Describes the loader behavior to use when 
a boot driver has failed to load. Fatal will 
prevent booting, whereas UseErrorControl 
causes the system to honor a driver’s default 
error behavior, specified in its service key.
ems
Boolean
KERNEL_EMS_ENABLED
Instructs the kernel to use EMS as well. (If 
only bootems is used, only the boot loader 
will use EMS.)
evstore
String
EVSTORE
Stores the location of a boot preloaded hive.
groupaware
Boolean
FORCE_GROUP
_AWARENESS
Forces the system to use groups other than 
zero when associating the group seed to new 
processes. Used only on 64-bit Windows.
groupsize
Integer
GROUP_SIZE
Forces the maximum number of logical 
processors that can be part of a group (maxi-
mum of 64). Can be used to force groups to 
be created on a system that would normally 
not require them to exist. Must be a power 
of 2 and is used only on 64-bit Windows.
hal
HAL image name
HAL_PATH
Overrides the default file name for the HAL 
image (Hal.dll). This option can be useful 
when booting a combination of a checked 
HAL and checked kernel (requires specifying 
the kernel element as well).
halbreakpoint
Boolean
DEBUGGER_HAL
_BREAKPOINT
Causes the HAL to stop at a breakpoint early in 
HAL initialization. The first thing the Windows 
kernel does when it initializes is to initialize 
the HAL, so this breakpoint is the earliest one 
possible (unless boot debugging is used). If the 
switch is used without the /DEBUG switch, the 
system will present a blue screen with a STOP 
code of 0x00000078 (PHASE0_ EXCEPTION).
novesa
Boolean
BCDE_OSLOADER_TYPE
_DISABLE_VESA_BIOS
Disables the usage of VESA display modes.
optionsedit
Boolean
OPTIONS_EDIT_ONE
_TIME
Enables the options editor in the Boot 
Manager. With this option, Boot Manager 
allows the user to interactively set on-demand 
command-line options and switches for the 
current boot. This is equivalent to pressing F10.
osdevice
GUID
OS_DEVICE
Specifies the device on which the operating 
system is installed.

BCD Element
Values
BCD Element Code3
Meaning
pae
Default, ForceEnable, 
ForceDisable
PAE_POLICY
Default allows the boot loader to determine 
whether the system supports PAE and loads 
the PAE kernel. ForceEnable forces this be-
havior, while ForceDisable forces the loader 
to load the non-PAE version of the Windows 
kernel, even if the system is detected as 
supporting x86 PAEs and has more than 4 
GB of physical memory. However, non-PAE 
x86 kernels are not supported anymore in 
Windows 10.
pciexpress
Default, ForceDisable
PCI_EXPRESS_POLICY
Can be used to disable support for PCI 
Express buses and devices.
perfmem
Size in MB
PERFORMANCE_DATA
_MEMORY
Size of the buffer to allocate for perfor-
mance data logging. This option acts simi-
larly to the removememory element, since 
it prevents Windows from seeing the size 
specified as available memory.
quietboot
Boolean
DISABLE_BOOT_DISPLAY
Instructs Windows not to initialize the VGA 
video driver responsible for presenting bit-
mapped graphics during the boot process. 
The driver is used to display boot progress 
information, so disabling it disables the abil-
ity of Windows to show this information.
ramdiskimagelength
Length in bytes
RAMDISK_IMAGE
_LENGTH
Size of the ramdisk specified.
ramdiskimageoffset
Offset in bytes
RAMDISK_IMAGE
_OFFSET
If the ramdisk contains other data (such as 
a header) before the virtual file system, in-
structs the boot loader where to start read-
ing the ramdisk file from.
ramdisksdipath
Image file name
RAMDISK_SDI_PATH
Specifies the name of the SDI ramdisk to load.
ramdisktftpblocksize
Block size
RAMDISK_TFTP_BLOCK
_SIZE
If loading a WIM ramdisk from a network 
Trivial FTP (TFTP) server, specifies the block 
size to use.
ramdisktftpclientport
Port number
RAMDISK_TFTP_CLIENT
_PORT
If loading a WIM ramdisk from a network 
TFTP server, specifies the port.
ramdisktftpwindowsize
Window size
RAMDISK_TFTP_
WINDOW_SIZE
If loading a WIM ramdisk from a network 
TFTP server, specifies the window size to use.
removememory
Size in bytes
REMOVE_MEMORY
Specifies an amount of memory Windows 
won’t use.
restrictapiccluster
Cluster number
RESTRICT_APIC_CLUSTER
Defines the largest APIC cluster number to 
be used by the system.
resumeobject
Object GUID
ASSOCIATED_RESUME
_OBJECT
Describes which application to use for 
resuming from hibernation, typically 
Winresume.exe.
safeboot
Minimal, Network, 
DsRepair
SAFEBOOT
Specifies options for a safe-mode boot. 
Minimal corresponds to safe mode without 
networking, Network to safe mode with 
networking, and DsRepair to safe mode with 
Directory Services Restore mode. (See the 
“Safe mode” section later in this chapter.)

Tells Windows to use the program specified

Control\SafeBoot\AlternateShell value as the 
graphical shell rather than the default, which
