I originally posted this on the Network Engineering forum, but it was suggested that I share it here as well.

I have been learning Python, and since I work in networking, I would like to start writing scripts that can assist me with my daily tasks involving network switches. My question is: What network-related projects have you used Python for? Specifically, what types of tasks have you automated with scripts? I am not looking for source code, but rather for inspiration and ideas for my own coding projects.

Thank you all in advance!

**Response:**

There are numerous ways to leverage Python for network automation. Here are some common tasks and projects that can serve as inspiration:

1. **Configuration Backup and Management:**
   - Automate the backup of device configurations and store them on a server.
   - Copy running and startup configurations from all devices at will.
   - Ensure configuration changes adhere to company standards.

2. **Configuration Changes and Audits:**
   - Automate specific configuration changes across multiple devices.
   - Search for and identify specific configuration entries that may need to be altered or updated.

3. **Device Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Monitor device status and generate reports.
   - Automate the collection and analysis of device logs.

4. **Network Documentation:**
   - Generate and maintain up-to-date network documentation.
   - Create and update network diagrams automatically.

To find more ideas and examples, I recommend searching GitHub, Pastebin, and Stack Overflow for projects that use the following libraries:

- `netmiko`: For network device communication.
- `paramiko`: For SSH connections and remote command execution.
- `ciscoconfparse`: For parsing and manipulating Cisco IOS configurations.

Scripts using these libraries are typically network-related and can provide a wealth of ideas and inspiration for your own projects.
