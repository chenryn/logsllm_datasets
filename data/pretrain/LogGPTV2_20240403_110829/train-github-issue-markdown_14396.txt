When using Microsoft Windows, the feature I miss most from X Window System is its distinct selection buffer. In X Window, the selection buffer and the clipboard operate independently, allowing for a more flexible copy-and-paste experience. Integrating a similar functionality into Microsoft Windows, where the selection buffer is managed separately from the clipboard, would be highly beneficial.

This enhancement would complement utilities like Xmouse, further improving the overall user experience.
