### Abstract
Forward-secure signatures (FSSs) have recently gained significant attention in the cryptographic community as a practical solution to mitigate the risks associated with key exposure in digital signature systems. However, prior research has not thoroughly explored the real-world performance and feasibility of FSSs compared to traditional, non-forward-secure signatures. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of several FSS schemes, comparing their performance both among different types of FSS and against traditional signatures. Our study makes two key contributions: first, we introduce a new methodology for evaluating the performance of signature schemes, and second, we provide a detailed examination of the practical performance of FSSs. We demonstrate that, in many cases, the best FSS scheme performs comparably to traditional schemes, with the worst-case scenario being only 2-4 times slower. Conversely, using an inappropriate FSS configuration can result in significantly degraded performance. Our methodology helps prevent such misconfigurations and is applied to common applications of digital signatures. We conclude that forward-secure signatures are not only theoretically valuable but also highly practical when used correctly, offering a robust solution to key exposure in real-world applications. Our metrics and reference implementation provide developers with the tools necessary to efficiently use FSSs.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Key-Exposure Problem
Digital signatures play a crucial role in ensuring security on the Internet, supporting applications such as electronic commerce, private and authenticated communication, and secure storage. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to key exposure, which is more likely to occur than cryptanalysis. Once a private key is exposed, all future and past signatures become suspect, leading to significant overhead in revoking and reissuing signatures and introducing new security vulnerabilities.

For example, the compromise of a Certificate Authority's (CA) root private key affects all certificates issued by that CA until clients are updated with the new root public key. All existing certificates must be revoked and re-certified, causing widespread disruption. In legal contracts, a party can repudiate a contract by exposing their private key, claiming the signature was forged. In an electronic checkbook application, if the private key is exposed, the bank and account holder must investigate and possibly repudiate every check, including valid uncashed checks.

### 1.2 Forward-Secure Signatures and Applications
Forward-secure signatures (FSS), first proposed by Anderson [2] and formalized by Bellare and Miner [4], offer a promising solution to key exposure. FSS differ from traditional signatures by periodically updating the private key via a one-way process, ensuring that past private keys cannot be recovered from the new key. This guarantees that the exposure of the current private key does not compromise past signatures.

FSS can fundamentally change the semantics of certificates and signatures. For instance, in a FSS-enabled CA, certificates are signed with a temporary private key and released after the key is updated. Subsequent compromise of the CA root key only affects certificates issued after the compromise, limiting the disruption. In an electronic checkbook application, the account holder can inform the bank of the compromised key version, allowing past signatures to be processed normally while voiding future ones.

FSS can also enable novel applications, such as limiting the monetary amount of data signed by a particular key. Once a threshold is reached, the signing key is updated, useful for one-time credit cards, betting slips, receipts, airline tickets, legal archives, and time-stamping services.

### 1.3 Our Contributions
This paper provides a comprehensive empirical study of the performance characteristics of FSS, developing a new usage-based metric to evaluate the trade-offs between different signature systems. Our study reveals that no single FSS construction performs well in all situations, and understanding the performance characteristics is critical to avoiding significant overheads. We show that, in many applications, the overhead of FSS over traditional signatures is minimal, and even in the worst case, it is only 2-4 times slower. We also provide a reference implementation of FSS schemes, which will be released under an open-source license.

## 2. Forward-Secure Signatures

### 2.1 Overview of FSS Schemes
In this section, we survey known FSS methods, focusing on their security and efficiency properties. We particularly examine the schemes evaluated in this work, which include most of the best-known methods to date.

#### 2.1.1 Simple Solutions
Consider a trivial FSS scheme with a parameter \( T \) denoting the total number of time periods. Starting from any standard signature scheme, the signer generates \( T \) secret/public key pairs \((sk_1, pk_1), \ldots, (sk_T, pk_T)\). The public key is set to \( PK = (pk_1, \ldots, pk_T) \), and the secret key for the first period is \( SK_1 = (sk_1, \ldots, sk_T) \). For each period \( 1 \leq j \leq T \), signing and verification are performed using the base scheme relative to \( sk_j \) and \( pk_j \). To update from period \( j \) to \( j+1 \), the signer erases \( sk_j \).

This scheme is secure as long as the underlying standard signature scheme is secure. Signature and verification times, as well as the size of the public and secret keys, are proportional to \( T \).
