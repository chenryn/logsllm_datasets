Assistant: It is very simple to use Ansible automation tool to configure and manage various system settings and configurations. The following is an example of using Ansible: Step 1: Install Ansible First, install Ansible in the management system. The installation steps may vary from system to system, but can usually be installed using a command-line package manager. For example, using the Ubuntu system, you can enter the following command to install: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ansible Step 2: Prepare Ansible playbook Ansible uses playbook files to describe automated management tasks. A playbook is a YAML file that contains a series of steps. Create a playbook file called webserver.yaml and enter the following: --- - hosts: webservers remote_user: root tasks: - name: install apache2 apt: name: apache2 state: present - name: create index.html copy: content: "Welcome to my website!" dest: /var/www/html/index.html Step 3: Run the playbook file Next, run the webserver.yaml file: ansible-playbook webserver.yaml The above command will complete two tasks : Install the Apache2 server and create a simple web welcome page. In practice, many tasks can be accomplished using Ansible automation tools, including installing and updating software packages, configuring network settings, adding and managing users, executing commands, and more. In short, through Ansible, system configuration and management can be easily and efficiently realized.
