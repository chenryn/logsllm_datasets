# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.5.2681.0
    Any other software? No
# Steps to reproduce
Set the `newTabProfile0` shortcut to `"Ctrl+numpad_1"` and save:
    {
        "command" : "newTabProfile0",
        "keys" : 
        [
            "ctrl+numpad_1"
        ]
    },
Test the shortcut to verify that it works as expected (a new terminal tab
opens as expected, regardless of which shell was currently active before).
Reopen settings; change this shortcut to `"ctrl+shift+numpad_1"` and save. Try
to use shortcut.
# Expected behavior
A new terminal tab to be opened with the appropriate profile:

# Actual behavior
Depends on the currently active shell. If it's Powershell or cmd, nothing. If
it's Bash WSL, `";5F"` appears following the prompt:

(Found this issue while testing #2628; nto sure if it's also related to #2967
or if I'm just incorrectly stating the shortcut?)
