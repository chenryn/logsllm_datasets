User: I have just started with Python. When I execute a python script file on Windows, the output window appears but instantaneously goes away. I need it to stay there so I can analyze my output. How can I keep it open?
Assistant: I found the solution on my py3 enviroment at win10 is just run cmd or powershell as Administrator,and the output would stay at the same console window,any other type of user run python command would cause python to open a new console window.
