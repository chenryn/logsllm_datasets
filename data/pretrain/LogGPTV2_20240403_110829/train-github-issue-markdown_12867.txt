### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.1
  * Operating System version: windows10
  * Java version: 1.8.0
### Steps to reproduce this issue
I run the code, which is copied from dubbo-samples-consul.
  1. run the docker-compose.yml
  2. run provider
  3. run consumer
### Actual Result
Provider seems ok:
![provider](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/16648345/59410921-a023a680-8dec-11e9-9e08-4e355e539e4f.png)
Consumer fails with error:
![consumer](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/16648345/59410968-c0ebfc00-8dec-11e9-8a2e-3eeb25f1d78c.png)
So I check the status of service on consul:
![health_check1](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/16648345/59410620-dc0a3c00-8deb-11e9-81a4-c5683655a610.png)
![health_check2](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/16648345/59410629-e298b380-8deb-11e9-9223-1916262d1a54.png)
It seems that health check fails, but direct connection to service without
registry is ok.
So is there anything that I do wrongly, or is there any difference on
windows10?
