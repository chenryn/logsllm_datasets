**ATT&CK ID:** T1573  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Encrypted Channel

Adversaries may use a well-known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control (C2) traffic, rather than relying on the inherent security features of a communication protocol. Although these algorithms are designed to provide secure communication, the implementations can still be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are embedded within the malware samples or configuration files. This exposure can potentially allow an analyst to decrypt the C2 traffic, thereby compromising the security of the encrypted channel.
