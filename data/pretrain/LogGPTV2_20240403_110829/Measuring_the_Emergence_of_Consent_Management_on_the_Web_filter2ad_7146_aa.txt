ABSTRACT
Privacy laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have pushed
internet firms processing personal data to obtain user consent. Un-
certainty around sanctions for non-compliance led many websites
to embed a Consent Management Provider (CMP), which collects
users’ consent and shares it with third-party vendors and other
websites. Our paper maps the formation of this ecosystem using
longitudinal measurements. Primary and secondary data sources
are used to measure each actor within the ecosystem. Using 161
million browser crawls, we estimate that CMP adoption doubled
from June 2018 to June 2019 and then doubled again until June
2020. Sampling 4.2 million unique domains, we observe that CMP
adoption is most prevalent among moderately popular websites
(Tranco top 50-10k) but a long tail exists. Using APIs from the ad-
tech industry, we quantify the purposes and lawful bases used to
justify processing personal data. A controlled experiment on a pub-
lic website provides novel insights into how the time-to-complete
of two leading CMPs’ consent dialogues varies with the preferences
expressed, showing how privacy aware users incur a significant
time cost.

advertising revenues [51]. Sanctions associated with recent privacy
laws threaten this state of affairs. In the EU, the General Data Pro-
tection Regulation (GDPR) requires firms processing personal data
to establish a legal basis, such as by obtaining user consent. In the
US, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires websites
to collect the consent of minors and also to allow users to opt-out
of the sale of their personal data. To comply with both laws, an in-
frastructure of consent must be designed so that users can consent
to the privacy practices of websites and Ad-tech vendors.
In the past, each website offered a unique privacy policy and
dialogue. This diversity overwhelmed users who could not commit
hundreds of hours to reading each privacy policy [6, 36] nor nav-
igate novel interface designs without making errors [2]. Privacy
advocates argued that users should set preferences in the browser
to avoid such problems [9, 27, 34], whereas Ad-tech companies
lobbied against standardized privacy. However, the new imperative
to obtain consent creates problems for Ad-tech vendors who must
manage and document heterogeneous forms of consent collected
across multiple websites.
Our insights include:
• Using 161 million browser crawls, we measure CMP adoption
over time and by website popularity. We show that uptake is
most prevalent among ‘mid-market’ sites (50th − 10, 000th),
although this varies between CMPs. We also show the win-
ners and losers of inter-CMP competition in the form of
websites switching CMPs.
• In terms of methodology, we introduce a novel URL sampling
approach seeded by social media shares, which improves sub-
site coverage. This is complemented by a traditional toplist
sample.
Consent management providers (CMPs) emerged in the last three
years to standardize the collection of online consent. These inter-
mediaries define legal terms and conditions, present these to users
via an embedded consent dialogue, store the resulting signal, and
share it with third-parties. In essence, CMPs have created a consent
ecosystem involving users, websites, and third-party vendors. For
example, one CMP allows websites to collect consent for a ‘Global
Vendor List’ with a membership fee of 1200 e, which was termed
the commodification of consent [60].
The rise of CMPs represents a new stage in how privacy prefer-
ences are communicated, with previous stages including cookies
settings in browsers [37] or custom cookie banners on websites [53].
This paper offers a longitudinal study of the formation of a consent
ecosystem orchestrated by CMPs. We introduce the notion of a con-
sent flow—from users through consent dialogues to a website and
then onto third-parties—and make measurements at each interface.
This complements post-GDPR related work relying on snapshots
of relatively small samples of domains, which is shown in Figure 1.

• Using APIs from the Ad-tech industry, we quantify the pur-
poses and lawful bases used to justify processing personal
data. We find many vendors claiming ‘legitimate interest’,
which allows them to process data without the user’s con-
sent.
• We address gaps in the literature by measuring the time to
complete consent dialogues, highlighting how users incur a
significant time cost when opting out.

tion 3 describes our measurement approach. Section 4 presents our
results, which are discussed in Section 5. We identify related work
in Section 6 and offers conclusions in Section 7.
2 BACKGROUND
Section 2.1 describes how privacy laws create demand for consent
management. Section 2.2 describes the organisations and technical
standards relevant to consent management solutions.
2.1 Privacy Laws and Consent
The role of user consent in recent privacy laws is the most signifi-
cant aspect for this paper. The GDPR applies to all firms processing
personal data, which entangles Ad-tech trackers and data brokers
as well as websites. Such firms can establish a legal basis for doing
so by obtaining user consent (Article 6.1a) or by claiming a legiti-
mate interest (Article 6.1b–f), such as if the data processing protects
the “vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person”
(6.1d) [47]. If controllers choose to obtain consent, it must be a
“freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the
data subject’s wishes” (Recital 32) and “documented” (7.1). A data
controller infringing either Article 6 or 7 is punishable by “a fine
up to e 20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide revenue.”
In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which
came into effect in January 2020, requires websites to: obtain

Framework (TCF).
parental consent for users under 13; affirmative consent for those
under 16; and to allow other users to opt-out of the sale of their
personal data [17]. The CCPA and GDPR further differ in the obli-
gations on third-party vendors and the definition of personal infor-
mation. The resulting uncertainty created a business opportunity
for CMPs who claim to specialize in compliance. The next section
describes the resulting products.
2.2 Consent Management Solutions
Ambiguity about how to technically implement the principles of
privacy law [7] led to heterogeneity in consent management solu-
tions. In response, the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) – not to
be confused with the Internet Architecture Board – developed the
Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), “the only GDPR con-
sent solution built by the industry for the industry” [20]. The TCF
standardizes and centralizes the storage of ‘global’ consent cookies.
It is visualized in Figure 2. We describe this technical standard to
illustrate what CMPs do, and also because it is implemented by
many but not all of the CMPs we measure in later sections.
The first building block of the TCF is the definition of purposes
and features that are shown to users. In TCF 1.0, purposes define
reasons for collecting personal data, for example; personalization,
ad selection, or usage analytics. Features on the other hand describe
methods of data use that overlap multiple purposes, such as combi-
nation with offline sources. A full list of purposes and features can
be found in Table A.1. Both must be disclosed to the users, but users
are only given control over consenting to individual purposes.
The second building block of the TCF is the Global Vendor List
(GVL), a master list of advertisers participating in the framework.
The GVL is maintained by the IAB. Vendors declare the purposes for
which they collect data and the features upon which they rely. They
can also declare legitimate interest for specific purposes, which
allows them to process personal data under the GDPR even if the
Measuring the Emergence of Consent Management on the Web

user does not consent. For each advertiser, the GVL contains; a name,
a link to the advertiser’s privacy policy, the feature and purpose
ids consent is requested for, and the declared legitimate interests.
Registered advertisers pay a yearly management fee of 1.200 e.
Cookie prompts implementing the TCF often request consent for
all advertisers in this list, even though the website does not have a
business relationship with every vendor. If the list is updated with
new vendors (or additional purposes), users are prompted with a
new dialogue in order to obtain additional consent.
The third building block involves the Consent Management
Providers implementing the TCF on publishers’ websites. They pro-
vide the cookie prompt, store the user’s choice as a browser cookie,
and provide an API for advertisers to access this information. The
IAB also maintains a public list for CMPs, which lists 150 participat-
ing providers as of May 2020 [19]. A website wishing to implement
the TCF independently must become a CMP, otherwise they can
out-source this to an existing CMP. In reality, a handful of CMPs
dominate the market.
Beyond the technical standard, IAB Europe also governs the
surrounding ecosystem. The legal terms used in consent dialogues,
such as the purposes of data collection, are standardized in the TCF.
Firms adopting the standard are expected to follow the defined
policy and IAB Europe publicizes a tool to audit CMPs (but not ven-
dors). We go on to provide evidence that the TCF is inconsistently
implemented in practice and not at all in some cases, such as for
CMPs targeting the US market.
3 MEASUREMENT APPROACH
We identify our items of interest (what we want to measure) in
Section 3.1. We map the items to a set of indicators and measure-
ment methods that collectively describe our methodology in Sec-
tion 3.2. Finally, we assess the threats to reliability and validity of
our methodology in Section 3.5.
3.1 Items of Interest
The following items (I1–I7) span the consent ecosystem, which is
visualized in Figure 2. In particular, the red arrows and pipes with
pressure gauges are the links in the ecosystem that we measure.
We know little about the prevalence of CMPs on the web. This com-
plicates generalizing results about CMPs from snapshot samples
of the most popular websites with size in the order of thousands,
as was done in previous work [32, 39]. In order to build a fuller
picture of the consent ecosystem, we ask: how does CMP adoption
vary according to website popularity (I1), and related, how has this
changed over time and been influenced by developments in privacy
law (I2).
The third item of interest relates to publisher behaviour: to what
extent do websites customize the embedded CMP (I3). Privacy laws
describe how consent can be legally collected, violations of which
have been studied in [32, 39]. The responsibility for such violations
is far from clear when a website embeds a CMP, which is especially
true when the CMP allows the website to customize the embedded
consent dialogue.
Turning to vendors processing personal data, there are many
