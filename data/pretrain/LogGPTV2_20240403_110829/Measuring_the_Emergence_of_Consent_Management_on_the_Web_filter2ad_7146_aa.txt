## Abstract
Privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have compelled internet companies to obtain user consent for processing personal data. The uncertainty surrounding penalties for non-compliance has led many websites to integrate Consent Management Providers (CMPs), which collect and share user consent with third-party vendors and other websites. This paper maps the development of this ecosystem using longitudinal measurements. By analyzing 161 million browser crawls, we estimate that CMP adoption doubled from June 2018 to June 2019 and then doubled again by June 2020. Sampling 4.2 million unique domains, we find that CMP adoption is most prevalent among moderately popular websites (Tranco top 50-10k), though a long tail exists. Using APIs from the ad-tech industry, we quantify the purposes and lawful bases used to justify processing personal data. A controlled experiment on a public website provides new insights into the time-to-complete for two leading CMPs' consent dialogues, highlighting the significant time cost incurred by privacy-conscious users.

## 1. Introduction
Vendors collecting personal data often operate without user awareness, employing covert tracking technologies [1, 29, 38]. Websites relying on advertising revenue have historically tolerated this [51]. However, recent privacy laws, such as the GDPR in the EU and the CCPA in the US, have introduced sanctions that challenge this status quo. These laws require websites to obtain user consent for data processing, leading to the emergence of an infrastructure for managing consent. Previously, each website had its own unique privacy policy and dialogue, overwhelming users who could not feasibly read each one [6, 36] or navigate different interfaces without errors [2]. Privacy advocates have suggested setting preferences in browsers to address these issues [9, 27, 34], while Ad-tech companies have resisted standardization. The need for consent has created challenges for Ad-tech vendors, who must manage and document diverse forms of consent across multiple sites.

Our key findings include:
- Using 161 million browser crawls, we measure CMP adoption over time and by website popularity, showing that it is most prevalent among mid-market sites (50th-10,000th).
- We introduce a novel URL sampling approach based on social media shares, complemented by traditional toplist sampling.
- Using Ad-tech industry APIs, we quantify the purposes and lawful bases for processing personal data, finding that many vendors claim "legitimate interest" to process data without user consent.
- We address gaps in the literature by measuring the time to complete consent dialogues, highlighting the significant time cost for privacy-conscious users.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Privacy Laws and Consent
Recent privacy laws, such as the GDPR and CCPA, have emphasized the role of user consent in data processing. The GDPR applies to all firms handling personal data, requiring them to obtain user consent (Article 6.1a) or claim a legitimate interest (Article 6.1b-f). If controllers choose to obtain consent, it must be "freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous" (Recital 32) and "documented" (7.1). Non-compliance can result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The CCPA, effective January 2020, requires parental consent for users under 13, affirmative consent for those under 16, and allows other users to opt out of data sales [17].

### 2.2 Consent Management Solutions
The ambiguity in implementing privacy law principles led to the development of the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) by the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). The TCF standardizes and centralizes the storage of global consent cookies. It consists of three building blocks:
1. **Purposes and Features:** Definitions of reasons for collecting personal data (purposes) and methods of data use (features), which must be disclosed to users.
2. **Global Vendor List (GVL):** A master list of advertisers, maintained by the IAB, detailing their purposes, features, and declared legitimate interests. Vendors pay a yearly fee of €1,200.
3. **Consent Management Providers (CMPs):** Implement the TCF on publishers' websites, providing cookie prompts, storing user choices, and offering an API for advertisers to access this information.

## 3. Measurement Approach
### 3.1 Items of Interest
We focus on the following items to build a comprehensive picture of the consent ecosystem:
- **I1:** How does CMP adoption vary according to website popularity?
- **I2:** How has CMP adoption changed over time and been influenced by privacy laws?
- **I3:** To what extent do websites customize the embedded CMP?

Previous studies have relied on small, snapshot samples, but our longitudinal study provides a more detailed and dynamic view. We also investigate the time required to complete consent dialogues, addressing a gap in the literature.

### 3.2 Methodology
- **Data Collection:** 161 million browser crawls and 4.2 million unique domain samples.
- **URL Sampling:** Novel approach based on social media shares, complemented by traditional toplist sampling.
- **API Analysis:** Using Ad-tech industry APIs to quantify purposes and lawful bases for data processing.
- **Controlled Experiment:** Measuring the time-to-complete for two leading CMPs' consent dialogues.

### 3.3 Threats to Reliability and Validity
- **Sampling Bias:** Potential bias in URL sampling and domain selection.
- **Temporal Changes:** Rapid changes in the CMP ecosystem may affect the generalizability of our findings.
- **Implementation Variability:** Inconsistent implementation of the TCF and other consent solutions.

## 4. Results
### 4.1 CMP Adoption Trends
- **Time Series Analysis:** CMP adoption doubled from June 2018 to June 2019 and again by June 2020.
- **Popularity Segmentation:** Most prevalent among mid-market sites (50th-10,000th).

### 4.2 Customization and Compliance
- **Customization Extent:** Significant variation in how websites customize embedded CMPs.
- **Compliance Issues:** Inconsistencies in TCF implementation, particularly in the US market.

### 4.3 Time-to-Complete Analysis
- **Controlled Experiment:** Significant time cost for privacy-conscious users, varying with the preferences expressed.

## 5. Discussion
Our findings highlight the rapid growth of the CMP ecosystem and the varying levels of adoption and customization. The significant time cost for users underscores the need for more efficient and user-friendly consent management solutions. The inconsistencies in TCF implementation suggest ongoing challenges in achieving full compliance.

## 6. Related Work
- **Previous Studies:** Point-in-time snapshots of small samples, such as [11, 16, 48, 56, 58, 30, 39, 32].
- **Quantcast Example:** Frequent changes in consent dialogues (38 times in our observation period).

## 7. Conclusions
This paper provides a longitudinal study of the emerging consent management ecosystem, revealing trends in CMP adoption, customization, and the time cost for users. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent and user-friendly consent solutions. Future work should focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of CMPs and ensuring broader compliance with privacy regulations.
