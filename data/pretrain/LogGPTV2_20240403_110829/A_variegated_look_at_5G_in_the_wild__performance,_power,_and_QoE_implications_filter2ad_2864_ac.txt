brightness level and subtract the screen power (which is obtained
separately) from the total when presenting the results. In this study,
power (in W) refers to energy consumed per unit time.
Data Collection Methodology. We conduct both controlled and
in-the-wild walking experiments to collect network and power
traces at two different cities in the US ‚Äì Minneapolis (MN) and
Ann Arbor (MI) ‚Äì using two commercial 5G carriers (Verizon and T-
Mobile). For Verizon, we collect data for their NSA-based mmWave
5G as well as their low-band 5G service. For T-Mobile, we focus on
their low-band 5G which is deployed in both SA and NSA modes. For
all our experiments, we use two models of 5G smartphones: S10 and
S20U. For the walking experiments, we fixed a 20-min loop (‚àº1.6km).
While low-band 5G connectivity for both carriers was omnipresent,
mmWave was rather limited. The loop contained three mmWave
5G towers each fitted with three directional mmWave transceivers.
We collect 10 traces for each unique carrier-mode-band setting
(e.g., Verizon-NSA-Low Band). The power monitor collects data
at 5000Hz while we set the network logging rate at 10Hz. As the
traces are collected separately by 5G Tracker tool [41] and Monsoon
power monitor, we synchronize them by starting both loggers at the
same time and further verify by correlating measurements activities
known to cause significant power jump.
4.2 RRC Parameters and Power
Using RRC-Probe, we infer a list of RRC parameters for 4G and
5G (see Table 7 in Appendix A.3 for details). From the results, we
find that the timers of NSA 5G and 4G LTE are very similar. This
is because NSA 5G still retains the existing 4G infrastructure for
control plane operations while innovating the data plane to enhance
the network capacity.
Fig. 10 illustrates the results of inferring the RRC states. For
NSA 5G, the RRC states are basically the same as 4G. However,
according to the 5G-NR specifications [20], a new RRC state called
RRC_INACTIVE is introduced in SA 5G. We believe this new state can
be seen in Fig. 10 (see top left part representing T-Mobile SA 5G).
We find that the UE remains in this state for about 5s (i.e., 10s to 15s
of interval) before transitioning to RRC_IDLE. The main purpose
of this state (akin to a low-power state) is to provide an efficient
mechanism for the UE‚Äôs radio to sleep (thus saving power) and at
the same time enable a quick and lightweight transition back to
the RRC_CONNECTED state (thus improving latency by reducing
the radio‚Äôs wake up time). These benefits are largely achieved by
reducing the control plane signaling overhead. Besides, we notice
that T-Mobile SA 5G has a tail timer of 10s which is similar to that
of T-Mobile NSA 5G and Verizon NSA 5G, indicating UE directly
enters RRC_IDLE after leaving RRC_CONNECTED. We also confirm
the timers using Monsoon power monitor. This is different from
the observations in [59] that found the 5G tail is 20s, i.e., 2√ó of 4G
tail (10s), which indicates the 5G module must go through both 5G
and 4G tails before entering RRC_IDLE. Careful attention needs to be
given in configuring such timers as they impact energy efficiency.
We next study the impact of 5G on power during RRC state tran-
sitions. We calculate the tail power by averaging the power readings
during the entire tail period considering both DRX On duration and
the rest of the DRX cycle. As shown in Table 2, 5G consumes more
energy than 4G during the tail period and for mmWave 5G the tail
power is especially higher. This is likely because the UE‚Äôs radio

remains active during the tail period in order to wake up periodi-
cally for paging and 5G radio consumes more power than 4G (when
the throughput is zero, shown later in ¬ß4.3). Further taking into
account the 4G ‚Üí 5G switch power which consumes additional
power and is very common (see Fig. 9), 5G is less efficient in terms
of state transitions. Therefore, to save power, traffic patterns like
periodical data transmission or intermittent waking up should be
avoided under 5G. One solution would be forcing the UE to stay in
4G when high throughput is not needed.
4.3 Power for Data Transfer
Previous work on 3G/4G power modeling [31] has constructed
power models for data transfer by taking into account the device
throughput and concluded that higher throughput leads to higher
power consumption. As 5G (esp. mmWave) can provide much higher
throughput compared to 4G, we study how throughput affects the
device power over 5G. With controlled experiments, we measure the
device power when transferring data at different download/upload
throughput over 4G and 5G. We run UDP data transfer and vary the
target throughput using iPerf3. To reduce the impact of poor signal
propagation issues of mmWave 5G, we run the experiments by
hand-holding the smartphone at a fixed location with Line-of-Sight
(LoS) to a 5G panel.
4G vs. 5G. Fig. 11 presents the relationship between throughput
and power with a comparison between 4G/LTE and 5G. We also
show this relationship across two different bands of 5G: NSA low-
band (LB) and NSA mmWave. These experiments were done on
S20U6 over Verizon. We can find that for both 4G and 5G, and for
both uplink and downlink directions, the power increases linearly
as throughput increases. However, the power for mmWave 5G
(uplink and downlink) increases at a slower rate than for the other
two radio networks. Although at low throughput levels the power
consumption for mmWave 5G is higher, it becomes more efficient
when the throughput is high. As seen in Fig. 11, the crossover point

at which mmWave 5G becomes more efficient than 4G and low-
band 5G is: (1) 187 Mbps and 189 Mbps for downlink; (2) 40 Mbps
and 123 Mbps for uplink. These results clearly reveal the power-
performance relationships (and trade-offs) between not just 4G
and 5G but also the different bands within 5G. Note that different
UE models may have varied levels of power consumption [24].
Similarly, we can observe different crossover points in throughput-
power curves between S20U and S10 (see Appendix A.4 for more
details). It is also interesting to compare the slopes between low-
band 5G and 4G/LTE. In the downlink direction, the slopes of LB-5G
ad 4G/LTE are almost identical. In the uplink direction though, LB
5G is much more efficient than 4G/LTE. Next, we calculate the
proportion of power consumed by data transfer activity out of total
power. On average, data transfer in mmWave 5G consumes 48-76%
of the total power consumption for downlink and 46-66% for uplink,
while the same for 4G are 21-53% (downlink) and 20-66% (uplink).
This is similar to what was also observed earlier by Xu et al. [59] (for
mid-band 5G). But our results show that the upper bound for 5G
downlink is higher by an additional 21% when compared to [59],
which is likely due to higher data rates offered by mmWave 5G.
We further calculate the energy efficiency (energy per bit) and
plot the results in Fig. 12 with a log scale, where we can also con-
clude the higher efficiency when transferring at higher speeds under
5G. 5G can be 79% (74%) less efficient than 4G at a low throughput
but up to 5√ó (2√ó) more when the throughput is high, for downlink
(uplink). In fact, this can also be confirmed from mathematical mod-
eling: Assume the device power is ùëÉ, energy efficiency is ùê∏ and the
throughput is ùëá , we will have ùëÉ = ùëê1‚àóùëá +ùëê2 and ùê∏ = ùëÉ/ùëá = ùëê2/ùëá +ùëê1.
So we can get log ùê∏ ‚âà ùëê3 ‚àó logùëá + ùëê4, by taking logarithm on both
sides of the equation. Here ùëêùëñ is constant.
Downlink vs. Uplink. We also compare the downlink transfer
with uplink transfer for 4G and 5G (Fig. 11). Based on the carrier
configurations, we conclude that the rate of increase in power
consumption for uplink is higher by 2.2√ó to 5.9√ó than downlink (see
Appendix A.4), which is in consensus to prior work on 3G/4G [31].
4.4 Impact of Signal Strength on Power
In addition to throughput, there are other factors affecting the
power consumption during data transfer. For example, poor wire-
less signal strength can negatively affect the device power sav-
ing [26, 55]. Moreover, due to poor signal propagation, mmWave‚Äôs

signal strength are known to fluctuate frequently and wildly due
to impact of UE-side factors such as mobility or signal reflection
characteristics of the surroundings (e.g., open space vs concrete
buildings) [40].
We conduct in-the-wild data transfer experiments to collect net-
work throughput and power traces at two locations with Verizon 5G:
(1) Ann Arbor, MI: mmWave 5G only, (2) Minneapolis, MN: both
mmWave and low-band 5G. Fig. 13 summarizes how power can
be affected by both RSRP and throughput. From the results, we
find that (1) higher throughput leads to higher power consump-
tion; (2) Signal strength also affects the power consumption, which
aligns well with earlier findings (¬ß4.3) and previous work [26]. To
better isolate the impact of signal strength and understand how
it affects power consumption, we show the energy efficiency for
different signal strength (RSRP) levels in Fig. 14. As NR-SS-RSRP
increases, the energy per bit decreases. This indicates that better
signal strength leads to improved energy efficiency. Moreover, for
Minneapolis (see right-plot on Fig. 13), we can clearly see there
are two clusters of data points. By looking at the network status
information, we further confirm that the points in the upper-left
cluster represent the data collected when the device is connected
to low-band 5G while the other points are for mmWave 5G. In Ann
Arbor, we only see mmWave 5G in the logs. Hence, we quantita-
tively observe that the power consumption varies across different
5G bands that the device is actively using.
4.5 5G Power Model Construction
Previous studies either only consider downlink/uplink through-
put [31] or signal strength [24, 42] when modeling the device power
for data transfer. However, neither of the assumptions hold given
the high variability of 5G throughput in particular for downlink
and the vulnerability of 5G signal to the physical environment.
Besides, we have seen different bands can have varied power con-
sumption characteristics, hence, it is also important to take into
account the band information. To improve model accuracy, we pro-
pose to build a network power model for 5G by considering both
signal strength and throughput. Based on the observations in ¬ß4.3,
a linear model can fit well for both uplink and downlink if we solely
consider throughput while controlling other factors. However, our

preliminary experiments show that linearly regressing with mul-
tiple factors such as throughput and signal strength together on
our walking dataset leads to even higher errors compared to only
considering throughput, indicating that the diverse array of multi-
ple impacting factors may not be accurately fit linearly, we instead
turn to machine learning-based data-driven approaches to identify
the relationships among features for power modeling. Specifically,
we apply the Decision Tree Regression (DTR) algorithm.
Model Evaluation. We construct our models and evaluate using
a standard metric for regression performance ‚Äì Mean Absolute Per-
centage Error (MAPE) to reflect the accuracy of our model in terms of
relative errors. As observed in ¬ß4.4, we construct the power model
for different devices (S10, S20U), networks (Verizon, T-Mobile), and
radio technologies (NSA/SA, mmWave/low-bands) separately. Note
we build models for each setting as opposed to using such infor-
mation as a feature in the model. We also generate models using
previous approaches for comparison. We plot the performance
results for all the models in Fig. 15, in which TH+SS represents
our model which takes into account both throughput and signal
strength while TH and SS represent the models generated only con-
sidering throughput or signal strength, respectively. Our models
always outperform the models generated from both the previous
approaches, which indicates that both features play an important
role in affecting the device network power consumption. Without
considering the throughput information, the errors of SS models
are found to be huge compared to TH+SS, especially for mmWave
(high-band, HB) which can deliver ultra-high bandwidth. For ex-
ample, using S20U, Verizon‚Äôs mmWave 5G service can provide up
to 3 Gbps (see in ¬ß3.2). S10 achieves around 2 Gbps over Verizon
mmWave 5G (similar to PX5, see Appendix A.1 for details). This
highlights the importance of throughput information for the power
model construction, especially for mmWave-based networks. Note
that there are performance differences between the models con-
structed using data from different devices (e.g., between first two
models). Not surprisingly, this signifies that different devices have
different hardware specs (e.g., chipset lithography) that impact
power consumption.
Validation on Real Applications. Finally, we evaluate the ac-
