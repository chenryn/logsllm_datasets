Bug report? | yes  
Symfony version | 2.7  
commit `faf671d`  
commit `c891413`
These commits clear $this->refs inside the Symfony\Component\Yaml\Parser\parse
method and references to anchors in previously parsed files don't work.
Removing the lines solves the problem and configurations based on such
overrides/includes work as expected.
Please, make a revision of the commited code and put some proper unit tests
for such configurations.
