**Bug Report**

- **Symfony Version:** 2.7
- **Commits:**
  - `faf671d`
  - `c891413`

**Description:**

The commits mentioned above modify the `parse` method in `Symfony\Component\Yaml\Parser`. Specifically, they clear the `$this->refs` variable, which results in references to anchors in previously parsed files no longer working as expected.

**Solution:**

Removing the lines that clear `$this->refs` resolves the issue, and configurations that rely on such overrides or includes function correctly.

**Request:**

Please review the committed code and add appropriate unit tests to ensure that these configurations work as intended.
