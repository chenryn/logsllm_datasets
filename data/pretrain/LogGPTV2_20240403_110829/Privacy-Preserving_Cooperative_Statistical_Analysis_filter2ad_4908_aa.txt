**Abstract:**
The growth of the Internet has opened up significant opportunities for cooperative computation, where the result depends on the private inputs of separate entities. In scenarios where these entities do not trust each other, secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques become crucial. This paper addresses the challenge of performing statistical analysis in a cooperative environment while preserving the privacy of each participant's data. We develop protocols based on data perturbation and cryptographic primitives to enable such analyses.

## 1. Introduction

The expansion of the Internet has created numerous opportunities for cooperative computation, where the outcome relies on the private inputs of multiple entities. When these entities do not trust each other, traditional methods that require a trusted third party are infeasible. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques offer a solution by allowing computations to be performed without revealing individual inputs.

Statistical analysis is a common computational task, but existing methods typically require access to the entire dataset. Little research has been done on how to perform statistical analysis in a cooperative setting where participants want to analyze a joint dataset while keeping their own data confidential. This paper develops protocols for conducting statistical analysis in such environments using data perturbation and cryptographic techniques.

This work was partially supported by Grant EIA-9903545 from the National Science Foundation and by sponsors of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security.

## 2. Problem Statement

In this paper, we investigate how various statistical analysis problems can be solved in a cooperative environment where two parties need to conduct analysis on a joint dataset. We refer to these as secure two-party statistical analysis problems.

Basic statistical operations include computing the mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficient, and regression line. If one has access to the full dataset, these operations can be performed using standard equations. However, in a cooperative environment, participants may need to conduct statistical analysis without knowing the full dataset due to privacy constraints. For example:

- A school wants to study the relationship between students' IQ scores and their annual salaries. The school has the IQ scores but not the salary information, which must be obtained from companies. Neither the school nor the companies want to disclose sensitive data.
- Two retail companies, A and B, each have data on their customers' buying behaviors. They want to perform statistical analysis on their combined data for mutual benefit but do not want to reveal detailed customer information to each other.

Standard statistical methods cannot easily address these privacy concerns. Our goal is to develop protocols that support statistical analysis in a privacy-preserving manner.

## 3. Models for Cooperative Statistical Analysis

There are two common models for cooperation in practice:

1. **Heterogeneous Model**: Each party observes different features of the sample.
2. **Homogeneous Model**: Both parties observe the same features of the sample.

The solutions for these models differ significantly. In the heterogeneous model, one party might only observe feature X, while the other observes feature Y. In the homogeneous model, both parties observe the same features but want to keep their data private.

## 4. Data Perturbation and Cryptographic Techniques

To preserve privacy, no party should send its data in plain text. We use data perturbation, adding random numbers to the original data to disguise it. Performing statistical analysis on perturbed data produces incorrect results, so we demonstrate methods to remove the perturbation without compromising privacy. These methods rely on cryptographic primitives such as 1-out-of-n Oblivious Transfer and homomorphic encryption schemes.

Most statistical analyses involve the scalar product of two private vectors. We study the private scalar product problem independently and use the solution to build our protocols. The private scalar product protocol can also be used to solve other secure two-party problems, such as computational geometry problems.

## 5. Assumptions and Future Work

In this preliminary study, we assume all parties are semi-honest, meaning they follow the protocol but may try to derive private inputs from intermediate computations. This assumption is widely adopted in secure multi-party computation studies.

### 2. Related Work

#### Secure Multi-Party Computation

The secure two-party statistical analysis problems are special cases of the general Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) problem. SMC deals with computing a function on distributed inputs while ensuring that no more information is revealed than what can be computed from the input and output. Theoretical solutions exist, but they can be impractical for specific cases. Our motivation is to develop efficient, specialized solutions for statistical analysis.

#### 1-out-of-n Oblivious Transfer

Our protocols heavily depend on the 1-out-of-n Oblivious Transfer (OT) protocol. In OT, one party (Bob) has n inputs, and the other party (Alice) learns one of these inputs without learning anything about the others, and Bob does not learn which input Alice chose. An efficient OT protocol was proposed by Naor and Pinkas, achieving polylogarithmic communication complexity.

#### Homomorphic Encryption Schemes

We use public-key cryptosystems with homomorphic properties, such as \( \text{Enc}(m_1) \cdot \text{Enc}(m_2) = \text{Enc}(m_1 + m_2) \). Examples of such systems include Paillier and ElGamal encryption.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Directions

This paper presents protocols for privacy-preserving cooperative statistical analysis. Future work will focus on extending these protocols to more complex statistical methods and improving their efficiency.
