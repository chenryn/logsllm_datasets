        )
the `mail_from=None` will trigger an error when sending the mail, when using
AWS Simple Email Service you need to provide a from address and has to be
already verified in AWS SES > "Verified identities"
### What you expected to happen
I expected it to send a mail but it doesn't because
### How to reproduce
_No response_
### Anything else
This is easily solved by providing a from address like in:
        smtp_mail_from = conf.get('smtp', 'SMTP_MAIL_FROM')
        hook.send_email(
            mail_from=smtp_mail_from,
the problem is: Can we reuse the smtp.SMTP_MAIL_FROM or do we need to create a
new configuration parameter like email.email_from_address ?
  * smtp uses its own config smtp.smtp_mail_from
  * sendgrid uses an environment variable `SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM` (undocumented by the way)
So, my personal proposal is to
  * introduce an email.email_from_email and email.email_from_name
  * read those new configuration parameters at utils.email.send_email
  * pass those as arguments to the backend (kwargs `from_email`, `from_name`) . the sendgrid backend can already read those  although seems unused at the momemt.
