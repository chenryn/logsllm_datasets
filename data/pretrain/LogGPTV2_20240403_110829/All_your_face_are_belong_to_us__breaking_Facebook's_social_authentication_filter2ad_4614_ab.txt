friends may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to identify them, especially when there
are loose or no actual relationships with such friends. A typical case
is a celebrity or a public ﬁgure. Even normal users, with 190 friends
on average1, might be unable to identify photos of online contacts
that they do not interact with regularly. Dunbar’s number [11] sug-
gests that humans can maintain a stable social relationship with at
most 150 people. This limit indicates a potential obstacle in the us-
ability of the current SA implementation, and should be taken into
account in future designs.
Another parameter that inﬂuences the usability of SA is the num-
ber of photos that depict the actual user, or at least that contain ob-
jects that uniquely identify the particular user. As a matter of fact,
feedback [15] from users clearly expresses their frustration when
challenged by Facebook to identify inanimate objects that they or
their friends have erroneously tagged for fun or as part of a contest
which required them to do so.
Finally, in certain cases, Facebook currently presents users with
the option to bypass the SA test by providing their date of birth.
This constitutes a major ﬂaw in their security mechanism. Obtain-
ing the victim’s date of birth is trivial for an adversary, as users may
reveal this information on their Facebook proﬁle.
2.4 Threat Model and Known Attacks
Throughout this paper we refer to the people inside a user’s on-
line social circle as friends. Friends have access to information
used by the SA mechanism. Tightly-connected social circles where
a user’s friends are also friends with each other are the worst sce-
narios for SA, as potentially any member has enough information
to solve the SA for any other user in the circle. However, Facebook
designed SA as a protection mechanism against strangers, who
have access to none or very little information. Under this threat
model, strangers are unlikely to be able to solve an SA test. We
argue that any stranger can position himself inside the victim’s so-
cial circle, thereby gaining the information necessary to defeat the
SA mechanism. Kim et al. [17] suggest that the progress made by
face-recognition techniques may enable automated attacks against
photo-based authentication mechanisms. At the same time, Dan-
tone et al. [8] have demonstrated that social relationships can also
be used to improve the accuracy of face recognition. Moreover, Ac-

quisti et al. [1] went beyond the previous approach and presented a
system that can associate names to faces and, thus, de-anonymize
a person solely by using a picture of his or her face. Although
no scientiﬁc experimentation on real-world data has been made to
measure the weakness of SA, these studies suggest that the face-
to-name relation, which is the security key behind SA, may be ex-
ploited further to demonstrate that the scheme is insecure. Our in-
tuition that attackers can overcome the limitations of Facebook’s
perceived threat model has been the motivation behind this paper.
2.5 Attack Surface Estimation
In our attack model, the attacker has compromised the user’s cre-
dentials. This is not an unreasonable assumption; it is actually
the reason behind the deployment of the SA. This can be accom-
plished in many ways (e.g., phishing, trojan horses, key logging,
social engineering) depending on the adversary’s skills and deter-
mination [10]. Statistically speaking, our initial investigation re-
veals that Facebook’s current implementation results in 2 out of 3
photos of each SA page (84% of 3 is 2.523) with at least one face
that a human can recognize. This makes SA tests solvable by hu-
mans. However, our investigation also reveals that about 80% of
the photos found in SA tests contain at least one face that can be
detected by face-detection software. This rationale makes us argue
that an automated system can successfully pass the SA mechanism.
To better understand the impact of our attack, we provide an empir-
ical calculation of the probabilities of each phase of our attack. In
other words, if an attacker has obtained the credentials of any Face-
book user, what is the probability that he will be able to access the
account? What is the probability if he also employs friend requests
to access non-public information on proﬁles? To derive the portion
of users susceptible to this threat, we built the attack tree of Fig. 2.
We distinguish between a casual and a determined attacker, where
the former leverages publicly-accessible information from a vic-
tim’s social graph whereas the latter actively attempts to gather ad-
ditional private information through friendship requests.
Friends list. Initially, any attacker requires access to the victim’s
friends list. According to Dey et al. [9] P(F) = 47% of the user’s
have their friends list public—as of March 2012. If that is not the
case, a determined attacker can try to befriend his victim. Studies
have shown [4, 5, 19, 24] that a very large fraction of users tends
to accept friend requests and have reported percentages with a 60–
90% chance of succeeding (in our analysis we use 70%, lower than
what the most recent studies report). Therefore, he has a combined
84% chance of success so far, versus 47% for the casual attacker.
Photos.
Ideally the attacker gains access to all the photos of
all the friends of a victim. Then with a probability of 1 he can
solve any SA test.
In reality, he is able to access only a subset
of the photos from all or a subset of the friends of a victim. Our
study of 236,752 Facebook users revealed that P(P) = 71% of them
exposed at least one public photo album. Again we assume that a
determined attacker can try to befriend the friends of his victim to
gain access to their private photos with a chance of P(B) (cid:3) 70%
to succeed, which is a conservative average compared to previous
studies. At the end of this step, the determined attacker has on
average at least one photo for 77% of the friends of his victim while
a casual attacker has that for 33%. This is versus Facebook which
has that for 100% of the friends with uploaded photos.
Tags. The next step is to extract labeled frames (tags) of peo-
ple’s faces from the above set of photos to compile (cid:4)uid, face(cid:5)
tuples used by Facebook to generate SA tests and by the attacker
to train facial models so as to respond to those tests. By analyzing
16, 141, 426 photos from out dataset, corresponding to the 33% of
friends’ photos for the casual attacker, we found that 17% of these
photos contain tags (hence usable for generating SA tests), yet only
the 3% contain tags about the owner of the photo. This means that
by crawling a proﬁle and accessing its photos it is more likely to get
tags of friends of that proﬁle than of that proﬁle itself. The astute
reader notices that Facebook also has to focus on that 17% of pho-
tos containing tags to generate SA tests: Facebook will utilize the
17% containing tags of all the photos uploaded by a user’s friends
and therefore generate SA tests based on 100% of the friends for
whom tags are available, whereas an attacker usually has access to
less than that. In the extreme case, having access to a single friend
who has tagged photos of all the other friends of the target user
(e.g., he is the “photographer” of the group), the attacker will ac-
quire at least one tag of each friend of the user and will be able to
train a face recognition system for 100% of the subjects that might
appear in an SA test. In practice, by collecting the tags from the
photos in our dataset we were able to gather (cid:4)uid, face(cid:5) tuples for
42% of the people in the friend lists of the respective users. There-
fore, assuming that all of a user’s friends have tagged photos of
them on Facebook, a casual attacker is able to acquire this sensi-
tive information for 42% of the tagged friends used by Facebook
to generate SA tests. As we show in §4.3, with only that amount
of data, we manage to automatically solve 22% of the real SA tests
presented to us by Facebook, and gain a signiﬁcant advantage for
an additional 56% with answers to more than half the parts of each
test. We cannot calculate the corresponding percentage for the de-
termined attacker without crawling private photos (we discuss the
ethical reasons for this in §5). However, we simulate this scenario
in §4.2 and ﬁnd that we are able to pass the SA tests on average
with as little as 10 faces per friend.
Faces. Finally, from the tagged photos, the attacker has to keep
the photos that actually feature a human face and discard the rest—
we can safely hypothesize Facebook does the same, as discussed
in §2.2. We found that 80% of the tagged photos in our dataset
contain human faces that can be detected by face-detection soft-
ware, and Facebook seems to follow the same practice; therefore,
the advantage for either side is equal. Overall, our initial investiga-
tion reveals that up to 84% of Facebook users are exposed to the
crawling of their friends and their photos. They are, thus, exposed
to attacks against the information used to protect them through the
SA mechanism. A casual attacker can access (cid:4)uid, face(cid:5) tuples of
at least 42% of the tagged friends used to generate social authen-
tication tests for a given user. Such information is considered sen-
sitive, known only to the user and the user’s circle, and its secrecy
provides the strength to this mechanism.
3. BREAKING SOCIAL AUTHENTICATION
Our approach applies to any photo-based SA mechanism and can
be extended to cover other types of SA that rely on the proof of
knowledge of “raw” information (e.g., biographies, activities, rela-
tionships and other information from the proﬁles of one’s social cir-
cle). We focus on Facebook’s SA, as it is the only widespread and
publicly-available deployment of this type of social authentication.
As detailed in §3.1, our attack consists of three preparation steps
(steps 1-3), which the attacker runs ofﬂine, and one execution step
(step 4), which the attacker runs in real-time when presented with
the SA test. Fig. 3 presents an overview of our system’s design.
3.1 Implementation Details
3.1.1 Step 1: Crawling Friend List
Given the victim’s UID, a crawler module retrieves the UIDs and
names of the victim’s friends and inserts them in our database. As
discussed in §2.5, casual attackers can access the friend list when
this is publicly available (47% of the users), whereas determined
attackers can reach about 84% of the friend lists by issuing befriend
