## Abstract
While click-based graphical password schemes using a single background image (e.g., PassPoints) have been primarily evaluated for usability, their security remains under-examined. This study investigates the security implications of such schemes, including the influence of different background images and strategies for guessing user passwords. We conducted both short- and long-term user studies: one lab-controlled with 43 participants and 17 diverse images, and another field test involving 223 user accounts. Our empirical data confirms the existence of popular points (hot-spots) in many images. We explore two types of attacks to exploit these hot-spots: (1) a "human-seeded" attack that harvests click-points from a small set of users, and (2) an entirely automated attack based on image processing techniques. The most effective attacks, generated by harvesting password data from a small set of users, can guess 36% of user passwords within 2^31 guesses (or 12% within 2^16 guesses) in one instance, and 20% within 2^33 guesses (or 10% within 2^18 guesses) in another. Our image-processing attack, which adapts a bottom-up model of visual attention, can guess up to 30% of user passwords within 2^35 guesses for some images but less than 3% for others. These results suggest that these graphical password schemes are at least as vulnerable to offline attacks as traditional text passwords.

## 1. Introduction
Text-based password authentication often suffers because users choose easily memorable, and thus easily guessable, passwords. Even when the theoretical password space is large, the effective password space chosen by users is much smaller, making exhaustive guessing attacks feasible. To address this, graphical password schemes, which require users to remember an image or parts of it, have been proposed. These schemes leverage the well-documented human ability to remember pictures better than words [25]. However, the security of these schemes, particularly in terms of the effective password space, is not well established.

One such scheme, PassPoints [45, 46, 47], and other click-based graphical password schemes [18, 4, 31, 37], involve users clicking a sequence of points on a single background image. Usability studies have focused on parameters like error tolerance, login times, and general perception [45, 47]. A critical question remains: how secure are these schemes? Despite speculation that security may be compromised by hot-spots—areas of an image more likely to be clicked—this issue has not been thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we analyze the security of a PassPoints implementation, confirming the existence of hot-spots and exploring their impact on security through both lab-controlled and field studies. We also evaluate two types of attacks: human-seeded and purely automated.

## 2. Background and Terminology
Click-based graphical passwords require users to log in by clicking a sequence of points on a single background image. Variations exist depending on the allowable click-points. We focus on PassPoints-style schemes, where users can click anywhere on the image. The tolerable error (tolerance) \( t \) is the allowed deviation for a subsequent login click to be accepted. For our implementation, \( t = 9 \) pixels, defining a 19x19 pixel square T-region. A cluster is a set of one or more click-points within a T-region, and its size is the number of click-points. A hot-spot is indicated by a large cluster relative to the sample size. Our implementation uses 451x331 pixel images, resulting in an alphabet of 414 T-regions. With 5-click passwords, the full theoretical password space is only 43 bits, which we discuss further in Section 7.

## 3. Lab Study and Clustering Analysis
We conducted a university-approved 43-user study in a controlled lab environment. Each session lasted about one hour, and participants were university students without expertise in computer security. Users created click-based graphical passwords on 17 different images, four from a previous study [46] and 13 selected to provide a range of detail. Seven of the 13 images were chosen to minimize hot-spots.

### Experimental Details
We implemented a web-based experiment. Users practiced creating and confirming passwords on two images. Parameters were consistent with previous usability experiments [47]: 5 click-points per password, 451x331 pixel images, and a 19x19 pixel error tolerance. Users were instructed to choose 5 distinct points. After practicing, users created and confirmed passwords on each image, followed by a 3D mental rotation task to simulate the passage of time. If users failed to confirm or log in, they could reset their password. Two images, paperclips and bee, had significant skips, suggesting lower security in practice. Images were presented in a random, unique order to avoid order bias.

### Results on Hot-Spots and Popular Clusters
To explore hot-spotting, we assigned all user click-points to clusters. We used a greedy algorithm to assign click-points to the largest clusters first, then sorted and permanently assigned them. This process determined the set of non-empty clusters and their sizes. We calculated the observed number of clusters of size 5 or greater, finding that some images had significantly more hot-spots than others.

## 4. Field Study and Password Harvesting Attacks
In the field study, we analyzed 223 user accounts over seven weeks. We explored two images in depth, selected based on the lab study's security measures. We implemented and evaluated two types of attacks: human-seeded and purely automated. The human-seeded attack, based on harvesting password data from a small set of users, was highly effective, guessing 36% of passwords within 2^31 guesses (or 12% within 2^16 guesses) on one image, and 20% within 2^33 guesses (or 10% within 2^18 guesses) on another. The automated attack, using image processing methods, guessed up to 30% of passwords within 2^35 guesses for some images but less than 3% for others.

## 5. Image Processing Methods for Guessing Attacks
We adapted Itti et al.'s [17] model of bottom-up visual attention and corner detection to expedite guessing attacks. This approach was successful on some images, even with naive dictionary strategies. Our most interesting contribution is the application of a human-seeded attack strategy, similar to Davis et al.'s [8] attack on recognition-based graphical passwords, but with a more straightforward dictionary generation method and seed data from a separate population.
