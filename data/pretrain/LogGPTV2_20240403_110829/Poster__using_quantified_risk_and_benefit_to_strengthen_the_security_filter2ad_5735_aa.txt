ABSTRACT
Risk and beneﬁt are two implicit key factors to determine
accesses in secure information sharing. Recent researches
have shown that they can be explicitly quantiﬁed and used
to improve the ﬂexibility in information systems. This paper
introduces the motivation and a technical design of Quanti-
ﬁed riSk and Beneﬁt adaptive Access Control (QSBAC) to
strengthen the security of information sharing. The paper
also introduces the key issues to design policies in QSBAC.

INTRODUCTION
With the development of the information technologies, in-
cluding cloud computing and social network service systems,
information is currently being shared on a larger scale. Peo-
ple can almost access and share their favorite information in
any place, at any time and with any device.
However, one of the most important challenges of infor-
mation sharing is how to assure its security [6]. That is,
the parties sharing the information should be protected ac-
cording to security policies which could be preset explicitly,
though policies are sometimes hidden in application scenar-
ios. For example, in case of personalization recommenda-
tion, if a user is willing to share more private data, he or she
will obtain a more accurate result. But, the risk of the leak-
age of private data will also arise. In this case, the policies
are hard to be preset.
Quantiﬁed risk and beneﬁt can be used to strengthen the
security of information sharing, because:

• Each security policy implicitly considers risk and ben-
eﬁt. Risk [1][3] and beneﬁt [7] are usually two key fac-
tors in security, and hidden in each step of the access
control processes. If we use a policy, where a user al-
lows a website to know his or her age, as an example,
the user obliviously will accept all risks and beneﬁts
brought by the website’s access to his or her age data.
The acceptance could be determined because the risk
is negligible, e.g. the website is an online banking site;
or because the beneﬁt is big enough, e.g. the website is
a social network service site where the user can share
information with his or her active friends.
• It is suitable to deal with emergent and dynamic ap-
plications where risk and beneﬁt aware policies can be
explicitly set [1][3][2].
If quantiﬁed risk and quanti-
ﬁed beneﬁt of an access request can be measured, the
decision result will be supported by more directed ev-
idence. This is especially important in emergent or
dynamic application scenarios, where the preset poli-
cies cannot meet all application scenarios. Usually,
the undeﬁned application situations will lead to the
use of a default policy, for example, reject all requests
for conﬁdentiality or integrity or allow all requests for
availability. Obviously, such default policies are not
very satisfying. Risk and beneﬁt aware policies can
make decision result based on explicit measurement of
risk and beneﬁt, which is a promising way to manage
dynamic application scenarios.
This paper introduces a technical design of Quantiﬁed riSk
and Beneﬁt adaptive Access Control (QSBAC), discusses the
key issues of the QSBAC policies, which include how to use
fuzzy set and fuzzy logic, and evaluates the policy engine of
QSBAC.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: section 2
introduces the steps to enforce QSBAC; section 3 discusses
the key issues to design the policies of QSBAC; section 4
evaluates the policy engine of QSBAC; section 5 investigates
the related work; and section 6 summarizes the paper.
2. STEPS TO ENFORCE QSBAC
QSBAC considers two types of quantiﬁed risk: risk of al-
lowing access (RAA) and risk of denying access (RDA), and
two types of quantiﬁed beneﬁt: beneﬁt of allowing access
(BAA) and beneﬁt of denying access (BDA).
The process of enforcing QSBAC consists of the following
steps:
781S1: Set Risk Mitigation Actions (RMA) and Beneﬁt Incen-
tive Actions (BIA): Risk mitigation actions refer to how
actions or modules in the system reduce the risk when
the information sharing access request1 is allowed or de-
nied, and beneﬁt incentive actions refer to how actions
or modules in the system stimulate the beneﬁt when the
request is allowed or denied.
S2: Set quantiﬁed risk and beneﬁt adaptive policies: A QSBAC-
enabled system will be policy-driven. That is, security
administrators will preset QSBAC policies. Note that,
the QSBAC policies are designed not to replace tradi-
tional security policies, such as role-based access con-
trol policies, but to be a supplement of them to deal
with the undeﬁned situations, especially emergent or
dynamic application situations.
S3: Quantiﬁed risk and beneﬁt measurements: The four vari-
ables (RAA, RDA, BAA and BDA) will be measured by
preset measurement functions. Due to the complexity
of processing the measurements and its domain-speciﬁc
feature, this paper does not discuss the details. Note
that, during the measurements applicable risk mitiga-
tion actions and beneﬁt incentive actions will be consid-
ered.
S4: Determine a request according to the policies and mea-
surements: When a request comes, the PDP (Policy
Decision Point) will evaluate the request and return a
result which includes a decision (allow or deny the re-
quest), necessary risk mitigation actions, and necessary
beneﬁt incentive actions.
S5: Implement the reponse with risk mitigation actions and
beneﬁt incentive actions: Traditionally, if a request is
allowed, a secure system will implement the request;
Otherwise, the secure system would do nothing. But
in a QSBAC-enabled secure system, the system would
implement the risk mitigation actions and beneﬁt incen-
tive actions included in the decision result. The actions
could be transactional and long-term. Therefore a more
complex session control mechanism is required for secure
information sharing.
S6: Record the runtime context as a data source to optimize
the risk mitigation actions, the beneﬁt incentive actions,
the policies and the measurement functions of quantiﬁed
risk and quantiﬁed beneﬁt.
3. POLICIES OF QSBAC
We extend XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup
Language)[5] to express policies in QSBAC. XACML is be-
coming a standard of access control policy language. XACML
mainly consists of the following tag elements: 
mainly consists of sub policy sets, policies, and obligations;
 mainly consists of the following elements: a , a set of , a rule-combining algorithm-identiﬁer,
an , an ; and
the  element mainly consists of the following ele-
ments: a , an , a , an , an .
Our extension, referred as to QSBAC-XACML, includes
the following extra elements:

sharing access request’ in the rest of this paper.
