User: Please help how it is possible to detect if python27 runtime is run in thread safe mode or not for code?
For example to notify that module is not compatible or apply threading code if required.
I want to port some code to python27 as thread safe and some as not thread safe but not understand how it works in Google App Engine.
Assistant: You can't have "some thread safe and some not thread safe". That's impossible. If some code is not thread safe, then none of the code is thread safe. That's just how thread safety works.
