**Description:**
The `query process` command displays information about processes running on a Remote Desktop Session Host server. You can use this command to determine which programs a specific user is running and which users are running a specific program. The command returns the following information:
- User who owns the process
- Session that owns the process
- ID of the session
- Name of the process
- ID of the process

**Syntax:**
```
query process [*|<PID>|<UserName>|<SessionName>|/id:<SessionID>|<ProgramName>] [/server:<ServerName>]
```

**Parameters:**

- **`*`**: Lists the processes for all sessions.
- **`<PID>`**: Specifies the numeric ID identifying the process you want to query.
- **`<UserName>`**: Specifies the name of the user whose processes you want to list.
- **`<SessionName>`**: Specifies the name of the active session whose processes you want to list.
- **`/id:<SessionID>`**: Specifies the ID of the session whose processes you want to list.
- **`<ProgramName>`**: Specifies the name of the program whose processes you want to query. The `.exe` extension is required.
- **`/server:<ServerName>`**: Specifies the Remote Desktop Session Host server whose processes you want to list. If unspecified, the server where you are currently logged on is used.
- **`/?`**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- Administrators have full access to all `query process` functions.
- If you do not specify the `<PID>`, `<UserName>`, `/id:<SessionID>`, `<ProgramName>`, or `*` parameters, the command will display only the processes that belong to the current user.
- When `query process` returns information, a greater than (>) symbol is displayed before each process that belongs to the current session.

**Examples:**

- To display information about the processes being used by all sessions, type:
  ```
  query process *
  ```

- To display information about the processes being used by session ID 2, type:
  ```
  query process /id:2
  ```

This command is useful for monitoring and managing processes on a Remote Desktop Session Host server, providing detailed insights into which users and sessions are running specific programs.
