Lately I have been playing with fonts with ligatures like PragmataPro, Fira
Code, Hasklig, etc...
The only way I have found to make Atom to actually render any ligature is by
adding `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` to my style config. Anyways, this
completely breaks pretty much the entire editor. Cursor position stops working
correctly (a single ligature requires 2 or 3 left/right arrow clicks for the
cursor to move back/forwards), the delete key acts really funny, etc...
Even more, after commenting `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility`, Atom keeps
doing funny stuff until I restart it.
Those type of fonts are getting more and more common; it would be really nice
if Atom could handle them correctly.
Btw, PragmataPro works just fine in Chrome, test it here:

optimizeLegibility` to the textbox you'll be testing.
