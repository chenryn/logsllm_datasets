### Current Behavior:
When the dependency tree contains multiple versions of a subdependency, npm installs the highest version at the top level (i.e., in `node_modules/pkgname`), even if another version is more frequently referenced. This results in the more frequently referenced version being installed multiple times, leading to redundancy.

### Expected Behavior:
NPM should determine the most frequently referenced version for each subdependency (excluding direct project dependencies) and install that version at the top level. This approach would minimize duplication and improve the overall structure of the `node_modules` directory.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Initialize a new npm project:
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install a specific version of `next`:
   ```sh
   npm install next@10.0.2
   ```
3. List the `source-map` dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm ls source-map
   ```

Expected: `source-map@0.6.1` should be the top-level version.
Actual: `source-map@0.7.3` is the top-level version.

### Environment:
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Node.js Version:** 14.13.0
- **NPM Version:** 7.0.12
