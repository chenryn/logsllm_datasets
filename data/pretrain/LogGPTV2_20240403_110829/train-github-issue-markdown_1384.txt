### Current Behavior:
When the dependency tree contains many versions for one subdependency, npm
puts the highest version at the top level (i.e., at node_modules/pkgname),
even when another version has more referrals. This other version is then
installed many times.
### Expected Behavior:
NPM checks for each package (that is not a direct dependency of the project)
which version appears most often and puts that one on the top level, reducing
duplication.
### Steps To Reproduce:
    npm init
    npm i next@10.0.2
    npm ls source-map
source-map@0.6.1 should be the top level one, not @0.7.3.
### Environment:
Windows 10  
Node 14.13.0  
Npm 7.0.12
