User: How to use SSH (Secure Shell) to remotely log in to a Linux server and execute some common commands, such as viewing logs and modifying file permissions?
Assistant: The following are the steps to remotely log in to a Linux server using SSH: 1. Open a terminal or a command line on the local computer, and enter the following command: ```sh ssh username@ip_address ``` where username is the username on the remote server , ip_address is the IP address of the server. For example: ```sh ssh john@192.168.0.100 ``` If it is the first time to connect to the server, it will ask whether to confirm the connection, enter yes and press Enter. 2. Enter the password on the remote server and press Enter. 3. After successfully logging in, you can enter commands in the terminal to operate the server, such as: View log files: ```sh tail -f /var/log/messages ``` Modify file permissions: ```sh chmod 755 file. txt ``` Use other common commands like ls, cd, mkdir, etc. 4. If you want to exit the remote connection, you can enter the exit command or use the shortcut key Ctrl + D. Note: Please be sure to keep your account number and password safe, so as not to be abused by others. When using SSH to connect, it is recommended to use public key authentication, which can improve the security of the connection.
