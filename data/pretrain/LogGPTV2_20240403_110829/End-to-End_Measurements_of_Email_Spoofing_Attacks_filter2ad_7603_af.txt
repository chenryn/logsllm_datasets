ioral differences in the role-playing experiments with re-
ality [59]. Our work is the ﬁrst to examine the impact
of security indicators on phishing emails using realistic
phishing tests.
Visual Security Indicators.
Security Indicators are
commonly used in web or mobile browsers to warn users
of unencrypted web sessions [25, 39, 61, 49], phishing
web pages [21, 24, 69, 70], and malware sites [7]. Exist-
ing work shows that users often ignore the security indi-
cators due to a lack of understanding of the attack [69] or
the frequent exposure to false alarms [43]. Researchers
have explored various methods to make security UIs
harder to ignore such as using attractors [13, 12, 14]. Our
work is the ﬁrst to measure the usage and effectiveness
of security indicators on forged emails.
9 Conclusion
Through extensive end-to-end measurements and real-
world phishing tests, our work reveals a concerning gap
between the server-side spooﬁng detection and the ac-
tual protection on users. We demonstrate that most email
providers allow forged emails to get to user inbox, while
lacking the necessary warning mechanism to notify users
(particularly on mobile apps). For the few email services
that implemented security indicators, we show that secu-
rity indicators have a positive impact on reducing risky
user actions under phishing attacks but cannot eliminate
the risk. We hope the results can help to draw more com-
munity attention to promoting the adoption of SMTP se-
curity extensions, and developing effective security indi-
cators for the web and mobile email interfaces.

forged email to bypass the SPF/DKIM check. However,
it gives the attacker a static and reputable IP address. If
the attacker aggressively sends malicious emails through
the vulnerable mail server, it can damage the reputation
of the IP. We have reported the vulnerability to the ser-
vice admins.
Appendix C – Misleading User Interface
Figure 11 shows three examples of misleading UI ele-
ments. Figure 11(a) and 11(b) show that when an at-
tacker spoofs a user from the same email provider as
the receiver, the email provider will automatically load
the proﬁle photo of the spoofed sender from its inter-
nal database.
In both Google Inbox and Seznam, the
forged emails look like that they were sent by the user
“Forged”, and the photo icon gives the forged email a
more authentic look. Figure 11(c) demonstrates the mis-
leading UIs when the attacker spoofs an existing con-
tact of the receiver. Again, despite the sender address
(PI:EMAIL) is spoofed, Zoho still loads the con-
tact’s photo from its internal database. In addition, users
can check the recent email conversations with this con-
tact by clicking on the highlighted link. These elements
make the forged email look authentic.

an attacker to piggyback on their mail servers to send
forge emails. This threat model is very different from
our experiments above, and we brieﬂy describe it us-
ing Figure 1. Here, the attacker is the sender MUA,
and the vulnerable server (e.g., runbox.com) is the
sender service. Typically, Runbox should only allow
its users to send an email with the sender address as
“{someone}@runbox.com”. However,
the Runbox’s
server allows a user (the attacker) to set the “MAIL
FROM” freely (without requiring a veriﬁcation) in step
 to send forged emails. This attack does not help the
