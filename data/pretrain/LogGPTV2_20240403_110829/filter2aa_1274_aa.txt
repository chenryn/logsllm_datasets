• Give back, so others can take 
your work to the next level
• Make yourself an expert 
• Valuable skill set 
• Fun and rewarding
• Get credit, notoriety, profit
• Build you resume
• You are already doing the work

What hackers bring to the table…
• Native curiosity

• Less constraints, Less fear
• Freedom to choose problems 
that industry or academia 
can’t/won’t touch

Seek to be the World Expert
• Or at least an expert
• N world experts in the 
room
• Momentum
• Once at edge you will 
see problems (and 
solutions) that others 
don’t know exist
“In fact, researchers have 
settled on what they 
believe is the magic 
number for true expertise: 
ten thousand hours.”

>How can I get in touch with 
you?
You can write to me in care of 
my publishers. They will then 
compost your letter, allow it to 
ferment for several months, 
and eventually send it to me. I 
will then neglect to reply, no 
doubt suffering an incremental 
increase in negative karma. It's 
up to you.

Look at What Editor’s Change
“Writing novels is hard, and 
requires vast, unbroken slabs of 
time. Four quiet hours is a 
resource that I can put to good 
use.”
“Two slabs of time, each two 
hours long, might add up to the 
same four hours, but are not 
nearly as productive as an 
unbroken four.”
“If I know that I am going to be 
interrupted, I can't concentrate, 
and if I suspect that I might be 
interrupted, I can't do anything at 
all.”
