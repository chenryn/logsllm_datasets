User: I am using os.remove in a for loop. Sometimes, the process was blocked, like a dead lock, but I'm not using a thread.
I want to know why process was blocked, and what can I do to prevent it?
Assistant: The file you're deleting might be in use or requires administrative privileges to remove. You can use a subprocess to call you script as an administrator.
