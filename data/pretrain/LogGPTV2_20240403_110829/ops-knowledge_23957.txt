User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there any security threat with open WiFi connection? For a few days, my mobile device has been able to catch Wi-Fi signals that are within its radius. It's not asking for a password to use the service. So, I'm using the Wi-Fi service whenever I need to. 

Is there any chance to hack my email and other accounts which I'm opening using this service? Are there any other security issues with this type of access?

Assistant: Unprotected Wifi networks, particularly in public places, are most certainly a threat. This is because you are connecting to a network without knowing who else could be on the network.

'Free Wifi' provided by cafes, restaurants, etc serve as excellent places for harvesting passwords.

The attacker will perform a Man in the Middle attack, typically by employing ARP Cache Poisoning. At that point, the attacker can read all plaintext passwords, including unsecured email (Email that does not use TLS), unencrypted ftp, websites without SSL, etc. Not to mention they can see all your google searches, all domains that you visit (encrypted or not) and so forth.

And they got to this point without putting in any real effort, ARP Cache Poisoning and Packet Sniffing are easy. A more advanced attacker might set up an active proxy on his machine to perform attacks such as SSL Stripping, which would give him access to all sites you visit, including HTTPS. This means he now has your PayPal, Facebook and Twitter passwords.

Moving on, an attacker might target your machine directly, if you have not updated your software in a while, is it likely that he can spawn a shell with Metasploit and download all your files for later analysis. This includes any saved browser passwords, authentication cookies, bank statements etc.



TL;DR: When connecting to a network, you are exposing your device and all your traffic to all other users of that network. In an open WiFi this includes the girl sat across the street in the back of a van with a Kali laptop and a GPU array. Update your software and don't log into anything sensitive without using a VPN.
