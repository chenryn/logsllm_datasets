Assistant: This log chunk shows the storage of broadcast variables and PythonRunner times in memory. The broadcast variables were stored as values and bytes, with estimated sizes ranging from 93.0 B to 384.0 B. The PythonRunner times were recorded as total, boot, init, and finish. The MemoryStore also stored two blocks, rdd_2_2 and rdd_2_3, as bytes with estimated sizes of 850.0 B and 930.0 B respectively.
