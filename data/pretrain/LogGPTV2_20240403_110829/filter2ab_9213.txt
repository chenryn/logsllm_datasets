title:blackhat:us-19 Arm IDA and Cross Check: Reversing the Boeing 787&#39;s Core Network
In 2008 the FAA issued several Special Conditions for The Boeing 787 Dreamliner. There were serious safety and security concerns about the brand-new network design Boeing had implemented, which provided the Dreamliner with some "e-enabled" capabilities never seen before. This scenario raised some alarms in certain security circles that eventually faded out.10 years later, this talk will provide the first public analysis of the Boeing 787's Core Network, revealing previously unknown vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to compromise the security of the original design. The talk will also elaborate on the additional implications of these security flaws.
