User: Which line endings should be used for platform independent code (not file access)?
My next project must run on both Windows and Linux.
I wrote code on Linux and used Hg to clone to Windows and it ran fine with Linux endings. The downside is that if you open the file in something other than a smart editor the line endings are not correct.
Assistant: In general newlines (as typically used in Linux) are more portable than carriage return and then newline (as used in Windows).  Note also that if you store your code on GitHub or another Git repository, it will convert it properly without you having to do anything.
