# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I created a `account` folder in the `pages` folder. And in this `account`
folder, I added a `index.js` file.
I would like to reach this page through `/account/`, but I get a 404 error. It
is only reachable through `/account`.
## Describe the solution you'd like
When I create a folder, I would like to be able to reach it with a trailing
slash.
