User: TAB completion works fine in iPython terminal, but not in Firefox browser. 
So far I had tried but failed,
1). run a command $ sudo easy_install readline, 
then the .egg file was wrote in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/readline-6.2.4.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg,
but TAB completion still doesn't work in Jupyter Notebook.
2). also tried to find locate the ipython_notebook_config.py or  ipython_config.py, but failed.
I use Python 3.5 and iPython 4.0.0.  and both are installed in Ubuntu 15.10  /usr/share/anaconda3/bin/ipython.
Any help would be appreciated!
Assistant: I had a similar issue and unfortunately cannot comment on a post, so am adding an easy solution that worked for me here.  I use conda and conda list showed I was running jedi-0.18.0.  I used the command conda install jedi==0.17.2.  This quickly fixed the problem for my conda environment.
Additional note: I usually use jupyter-lab, and was not seeing the error messages generated.  By switching to jupyter notebook, I saw the following error:

I highlighted a couple of the jedi messages, but this all reinforced it was a problem related to the version of jedi installed.
