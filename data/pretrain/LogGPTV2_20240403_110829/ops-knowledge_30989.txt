**Issue: Tab Completion in Jupyter Notebook (Firefox) Not Working**

I am experiencing an issue with tab completion in the Jupyter Notebook when using Firefox. The tab completion works as expected in the iPython terminal, but it does not function in the browser. Here is a summary of my attempts to resolve the problem:

1. **Installation of readline:**
   - I ran the command: 
     ```
     $ sudo easy_install readline
     ```
   - This installed the .egg file at the following location:
     ```
     /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/readline-6.2.4.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg
     ```
   - However, this did not resolve the tab completion issue in the Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Locating Configuration Files:**
   - I attempted to locate and modify the `ipython_notebook_config.py` or `ipython_config.py` files, but was unable to find them.

**Environment Details:**
- Python 3.5
- iPython 4.0.0
- Ubuntu 15.10
- iPython installed at: `/usr/share/anaconda3/bin/ipython`

**Solution Provided by Another User:**

A user who faced a similar issue suggested downgrading the `jedi` package. They were using `conda` and found that they had `jedi-0.18.0` installed. By running the following command, the issue was resolved:
```
conda install jedi==0.17.2
```

**Additional Note:**
- The user typically uses JupyterLab, where the error messages were not visible.
- Switching to the Jupyter Notebook revealed the following error:

```plaintext

    super().init(code, environment=environment,

```

This error trace indicates that the issue was related to the version of `jedi` installed.
