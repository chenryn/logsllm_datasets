Appendix
A Tuned TTS
Table 5 shows the parameters of tuning18 and the size of the
corpus after ﬁltering for each target black-box model. Note
that the ﬁltered corpus for Amazon Transcribe API is less than
other platforms even with a much lower conﬁdence. Therefore,
we think this model may not be sensitive to our TTS audios
of these commands, which is stated in Section 6.2.

B Impacts of Supplemental Corpus
As mentioned in Section 5.3, we used the open source corpus
of Mini Librispeech as supplement to enrich the features of
the tuned TTS corpus. To evaluate the impact of various sizes
of the supplemental corpus, we trained several substitute mod-
els by combining the tuned audios for Microsoft Bing Speech
Service API (6.83 hours) with different scales of supplemental
corpus as the training corpus. The sizes of the supplemental
corpus include 1-hour, 3-hours, 5-hours, 20-hours, 40-hours,
respectively19. Consequently, we obtained ﬁve different sub-
stitute models for Microsoft Bing Speech Service API, and
generated AEs based on them. The embedded commands are
the ten target commands of Microsoft Bing Speech Service
API listed in Table 10 in Appendix G.

Microsoft Bing Speech Service API.

The results are shown in Table 6. The column “Pdf-id num-
bers” indicates the total number of the probability distribution
function identiﬁers of the phonemes’ features. It can be seen
that, except the substitute model trained with 1-hour supple-
mental corpus, the AEs generated from the other models can
18We use “SoX – Sound eXchange” to generate noise, and the maximum
amplitude is 1.
19Since the size of the entire corpus of the Mini Librispeech is 7.35 hours,
so the oversized corpus of 20-hours and 40-hours were randomly chosen
from Librispeech corpus (about 1000 hours).

all attack the target successfully. Probably the reason is that
the substitute model trained with 1-hour supplemental corpus
does not learn enough features.
C Local Model Approximation with a Larger
Corpus.
In Table 7, we show the commands and effectiveness for
“local model approximation with a larger corpus” method
introduced in Section 6.4.

model.

E Details of Human Perception Survey
The participants were asked to listen to each audio
and answer the question whether they think it
is a
weird song. The details of the survey can be found in
https://github.com/RiskySignal/Devil-Whisper-Attack. At the
end of the questionnaire, we added one plain TTS audio ask-
ing the participant to write down the clearly pronounced num-
ber. Such attention question at the end will help us ﬁlter out
the questionnaires with random responses. In addition, we
also recorded how many times each audio was played. Finally,
we got 70 effective questionnaires from 120 participants after
ﬁltering.
F Transferability of the AEs on Apple Siri
We test the AEs of other platforms on the wakened Apple
Siri. If Siri can recognize the hidden command correctly, we
consider the AE for the target command successful. Detailed
commands can be found in Table 9.
