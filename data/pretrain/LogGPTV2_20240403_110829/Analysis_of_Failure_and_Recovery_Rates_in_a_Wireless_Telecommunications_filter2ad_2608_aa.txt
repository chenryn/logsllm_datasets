Abstract
We derive estimates of mean time to failure and mean
time to recover/repair for both hardware and software in
a large wireless telecommunications system, based on six
months of manually recorded outage data. The observed
failure and recovery distributions are not consistent with
simple exponential processes. The data can be described
by Weibull or two-stage hyper-exponential distributed pro-
cesses. The duration distributions for scheduled and un-
scheduled software outages have very different characteris-
tics. The complex distributions observed may be the compo-
sition of simple independent processes which cannot be sep-
arated in this data set due to a lack of adequately detailed
information or proper characterization of outage causes.
In this system we found a coverage of (cid:24) 98 for auto-
recovery from unscheduled software failures with an auto-
repair fraction of (cid:24) 36.
1. Introduction
Modeling and predicting the availability of new plat-
forms requires knowledge of certain key parameters, e.g.,
mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to re-
cover/repair (MTTR). One way to provide reasonable esti-
mates for these parameters is to examine ﬁeld performance
data from currently deployed systems. We are particularly
concerned here with the observed rate of outages in differ-
ent failure classes (which maps to MTTF), the mean outage
duration (which is a measure of MTTR), and the probability
of successful recovery (or coverage).
A critical additional question for modeling is: What
are the actual failure and outage distributions? Simple
Markov models assume that the outage durations and times-
to-failure are distributed as pure exponentials; if this is not
the case, modeling the system assuming exponentials and
the derived MTTRs/MTTFs may produce unreliable results.
It is arguable that characterizing the shapes of the distribu-
tions is actually more important than the parameters, reﬂect-
ing something fundamental about the way systems behave.
The following analysis attempts to characterize failure
and recovery behavior for a cellular telephone system based
on outages reported by operators in manual logs covering a
continuous period of 184 days. The system consisted of a
number of base station systems (BSS), each made up of a
base station controller (BSC) controlling one or more base
transceiver stations (BTSs). The number of BTSs in the sys-
tem (1288) remained roughly constant over this period. The
logs provide detailed documentation of all system outages
to the BTS level. Outage times (start, stop, and duration)
are recorded with a resolution of one minute. Each outage
is assigned to one of 6 “Problem” categories (Table 1): BSC
Hardware, BSS Software, BTS Hardware, Environmental
Related, TELCO Related, and Human Error. (Ten events
logged in non-standard categories were combined into ei-
ther the Environmental or TELCO classes, as appropriate.
No outages were directly attributed to overload.) These as-
signments represent the operators’ evaluation of the source
or root cause of each system failure. Other information
available in the logs includes whether an outage was sched-
uled or unscheduled and a free-form Remarks ﬁeld which
may contain additional details about the outage.
2. Outage impact by failure type
A summary of the outages is shown in Table 1. Out-
age categories are taken directly from the outage logs; for
BTS Hardware and BSS Software we have also shown the
results further divided into scheduled and unscheduled out-
ages. The quoted errors on mean outages are computed
from the sample variance.
External causes dominate, with the Environmental and
TELCO categories accounting for 68.4% of the total re-

ported outage time. We can compare this to Kuhn’s anal-
ysis of reported failures in PSTN [4]. Kuhn’s categories of
“Human errors (others)”, “Acts of nature”, and “Vandalism”
correspond to our Environmental and TELCO Related cat-
egories; in Kuhn these accounted for 59% of non-overload
outage time, roughly comparable to what we see in the cel-
lular system data.
Kuhn’s data are biased to long outages (> 30 min) of
large switches and do not necessarily reﬂect the total be-
havior of the systems we are interested in here. A more
direct comparison can be made by examining only the long
(> 30 min) outages in the wireless data. The Environmental
and TELCO categories account for about the same fraction
(71.6%) of the total outage time in these longer outages as
they do in the overall data set.
On the other hand, the “Human error” rate reported here
is extremely low compared to Kuhn and other industry stud-
ies of causes of telecommunications outages. Kuhn’s “hu-
man errors (company)” accounted for 25% of outages and
14% of customer minutes lost. Presumably in our data many
of these types of errors have been placed in other categories.
The largest “internal” contributor to outage time is BSS
Software, at 22.3%, followed by BTS Hardware (5.6%).
These are the outages we will try to characterize in the fol-
lowing sections.
3. MTTF Estimates
Assuming the number of BTSs is constant throughout
the observation period (184 days), we can derive estimated
MTTFs for each class of failure from the outage data. In
order to examine the actual distribution of failures, we can
perform survival analysis of the systems taking into account
the censoring effects of the ﬁnite observation interval.

Time (hr)
log(Time (hr))
For the BTS Hardware failures, we determine for each
BTS the time to ﬁrst hardware failure. (Because we have
taken  = 0 at the start of the logs, the MTTFs derived for
this system at this time may not directly apply to installa-
tions at other stages in their lifetime.) BTSs which do not
fail before the end of the observation interval are assigned
a right-censored interval of 184 days. From this list of in-
tervals we can derive a survival curve based on the Kaplan-
Meier estimator [3, 2, 6]. The survival curve (Figure 1) esti-
mates S(t), the fraction of systems surviving (i.e., not failed)
as a function of time.

Time (hr)
log(Time (hr))
The Weibull distribution, commonly used in reliability
analysis, is a generalization of the exponential distribution
with a time-dependent failure rate (or hazard function)
h = (cid:21)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:11) 1:
Thus (cid:11)  1 an increasing failure rate, and (cid:11) = 1 reduces to the
exponential process.
The right hand panel in Figure 1 is a replotting of the
estimated survival curve as log(-log(S(t))) vs. log(t); un-
der this scaling a Weibull distributed process will produce a
straight line with a slope equal to the shape parameter (cid:11) and
a log(t) intercept equal to (cid:11) g(cid:21) [2]. In this case we can
see that the data are fairly well-described by a line, follow-
ing a Weibull distribution with (cid:11) = 0:841 and 1=(cid:21) = 62900
hrs.
The mean of the Weibull distribution is given by
(cid:21) 1 1  1=(cid:11), so the MTTF estimated from the ﬁtted pa-
rameters is 68,900 hrs. This is signiﬁcantly higher than the
simple estimate of 31,800 hrs obtained assuming an expo-
nential failure process.
For software failures we consider time-to-failure not
only for the ﬁrst failure on each BTS but for every fail-
ure (counting from the last software reset). This is justi-
ﬁed since a software reset provides essentially a clean state
and restarts the lifetime clock. (We have further assumed
that any type of failure on the BTS implies a software re-
set.) Figure 2 shows the estimated survival curve for the
unscheduled BSS Software failures. The right hand plot in
Figure 2 is the Weibull scaling of the same curve, show-
ing that a Weibull process is a good model of the unsched-
uled software failures. The ﬁtted line has (cid:11) = 0:443 and
1=(cid:21) = 2570 hrs, giving a MTTF of 6600 hrs for unsched-
uled software failures. This is a rapidly decreasing fail-
ure rate, implying software failures are more likely near
the time of restart, possibly due to initialization problems.
(Software aging, on the other hand, would produce an in-
creasing failure rate during the operating interval.)
Note that we are considering the intervals between fail-
ures, independent of the location of the interval in the ob-
servation period. This should not be confused with reliabil-
ity growth measures which would determine a systematic
change in failure rate from the beginning to the end of the
period covered by the logs.
There is a signiﬁcant variation from month to month in
the software failure rates. This variation indicates that there
are some changes either in the software or the system oper-
ating environment during this period which affect the soft-
ware MTTF. Further investigation of possible changes in
the system is necessary to understand the observed ﬂuctua-
tions and their effect on the failure distributions. In contrast
to the software MTTF, the month to month variation of the
HW MTTF is reasonably consistent with statistical ﬂuctua-
tion about the overall mean.
The logs do not distinguish between software failures
originating in a BTS and those from a BSC, combining both
into the single problem category of BSS Software. How-
ever, if the root cause of a BSS SW outage were a BSC SW
failure we would expect to see a large number of simulta-
neous BTS outages resulting from the loss of the controller.
Since there aren’t any cases like that in this problem class
we have assumed (somewhat conservatively) that all BSS
SW outages are BTS SW failures.
