## Abstract
This study derives estimates of the mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to recover/repair (MTTR) for both hardware and software components in a large wireless telecommunications system, based on six months of manually recorded outage data. The observed failure and recovery distributions do not conform to simple exponential processes but can be described by Weibull or two-stage hyper-exponential distributed processes. The duration distributions for scheduled and unscheduled software outages exhibit distinct characteristics. The complex distributions observed may be the result of the composition of simple independent processes that cannot be separated due to a lack of detailed information or proper characterization of outage causes. In this system, we found an auto-recovery coverage of approximately 98% for unscheduled software failures, with an auto-repair fraction of about 36%.

## 1. Introduction
Modeling and predicting the availability of new platforms requires knowledge of key parameters such as MTTF and MTTR. One approach to provide reasonable estimates for these parameters is to analyze field performance data from currently deployed systems. This study focuses on the observed rate of outages in different failure classes (which maps to MTTF), the mean outage duration (a measure of MTTR), and the probability of successful recovery (or coverage).

A critical question for modeling is: What are the actual failure and outage distributions? Simple Markov models assume that outage durations and times-to-failure follow pure exponential distributions. If this assumption is incorrect, modeling the system with exponentials and the derived MTTRs/MTTFs may produce unreliable results. Characterizing the shapes of the distributions is often more important than the parameters themselves, as it reflects fundamental aspects of system behavior.

The following analysis characterizes failure and recovery behavior for a cellular telephone system based on outages reported by operators in manual logs covering a continuous period of 184 days. The system consists of multiple base station systems (BSS), each comprising a base station controller (BSC) and one or more base transceiver stations (BTSs). The number of BTSs (1288) remained roughly constant over this period. The logs provide detailed documentation of all system outages down to the BTS level, with outage times (start, stop, and duration) recorded to the minute. Each outage is categorized into one of six "Problem" categories: BSC Hardware, BSS Software, BTS Hardware, Environmental Related, TELCO Related, and Human Error. Ten events logged in non-standard categories were reclassified into either the Environmental or TELCO classes, as appropriate. No outages were directly attributed to overload. These assignments represent the operators' evaluation of the source or root cause of each system failure. Additional information includes whether an outage was scheduled or unscheduled and a free-form Remarks field for additional details.

## 2. Outage Impact by Failure Type
Table 1 summarizes the outages, categorizing them directly from the outage logs. For BTS Hardware and BSS Software, the results are further divided into scheduled and unscheduled outages. The quoted errors on mean outages are computed from the sample variance.

External causes dominate, with the Environmental and TELCO categories accounting for 68.4% of the total reported outage time. This can be compared to Kuhn's analysis of reported failures in PSTN, where similar categories accounted for 59% of non-overload outage time. However, Kuhn's data are biased towards long outages (> 30 min) of large switches and may not reflect the total behavior of the systems under study here. When examining only the long (> 30 min) outages in the wireless data, the Environmental and TELCO categories account for about the same fraction (71.6%) of the total outage time.

The "Human error" rate reported here is extremely low compared to Kuhn and other industry studies, which attribute 25% of outages and 14% of customer minutes lost to human errors. Presumably, many of these types of errors have been placed in other categories in our data. The largest internal contributor to outage time is BSS Software, at 22.3%, followed by BTS Hardware (5.6%).

## 3. MTTF Estimates
Assuming the number of BTSs is constant throughout the observation period (184 days), we derive estimated MTTFs for each class of failure from the outage data. To examine the actual distribution of failures, we perform survival analysis, taking into account the censoring effects of the finite observation interval.

### BTS Hardware Failures
For BTS Hardware failures, we determine the time to the first hardware failure for each BTS. BTSs that do not fail before the end of the observation interval are assigned a right-censored interval of 184 days. From this list of intervals, we derive a survival curve using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The survival curve (Figure 1) estimates \( S(t) \), the fraction of systems surviving (i.e., not failed) as a function of time.

The Weibull distribution, commonly used in reliability analysis, is a generalization of the exponential distribution with a time-dependent failure rate (or hazard function) \( h(t) = \lambda \beta (\lambda t)^{\beta-1} \). Thus, \( \beta > 1 \) indicates an increasing failure rate, and \( \beta = 1 \) reduces to the exponential process.

The right-hand panel in Figure 1 replots the estimated survival curve as \( \log(-\log(S(t))) \) vs. \( \log(t) \). Under this scaling, a Weibull-distributed process will produce a straight line with a slope equal to the shape parameter \( \beta \) and a \( \log(t) \) intercept equal to \( \log(\lambda) \). In this case, the data are well-described by a line, following a Weibull distribution with \( \beta = 0.841 \) and \( 1/\lambda = 62900 \) hours. The mean of the Weibull distribution is given by \( \lambda^{-1/\beta} \), so the MTTF estimated from the fitted parameters is 68,900 hours. This is significantly higher than the simple estimate of 31,800 hours obtained assuming an exponential failure process.

### BSS Software Failures
For software failures, we consider the time-to-failure not only for the first failure on each BTS but for every failure (counting from the last software reset). A software reset provides a clean state and restarts the lifetime clock. (We assume that any type of failure on the BTS implies a software reset.) Figure 2 shows the estimated survival curve for the unscheduled BSS Software failures. The right-hand plot in Figure 2 is the Weibull scaling of the same curve, showing that a Weibull process is a good model of the unscheduled software failures. The fitted line has \( \beta = 0.443 \) and \( 1/\lambda = 2570 \) hours, giving an MTTF of 6600 hours for unscheduled software failures. This indicates a rapidly decreasing failure rate, suggesting that software failures are more likely near the time of restart, possibly due to initialization problems. (Software aging would produce an increasing failure rate during the operating interval.)

There is significant variation in the software failure rates from month to month, indicating changes in the software or system operating environment during this period. Further investigation is necessary to understand these fluctuations and their effect on the failure distributions. In contrast, the month-to-month variation of the hardware MTTF is reasonably consistent with statistical fluctuation about the overall mean.

The logs do not distinguish between software failures originating in a BTS and those from a BSC, combining both into the single problem category of BSS Software. However, if the root cause of a BSS SW outage were a BSC SW failure, we would expect to see a large number of simultaneous BTS outages resulting from the loss of the controller. Since there are no such cases in this problem class, we assume (somewhat conservatively) that all BSS SW outages are BTS SW failures.

### Exponential Q-Q Plot for BTS HW Outage Durations
Figure 3 shows an exponential Q-Q plot for BTS HW outage durations in the wireless system data. Overplotted are two exponential distributions that together roughly describe the data.

### BTS Hardware Repair Durations
Figure 4 shows the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival curve for BTS Hardware repair durations, with normal scaling and 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines) and, right, with Weibull scaling, as in Figure 1.
