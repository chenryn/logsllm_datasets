- Components and architecture

## 3. Live Demonstration
- Step-by-step demonstration
- Real-time setup and configuration

## 4. Demo Results
- Observations and outcomes
- Performance metrics

## 5. Cisco Deployment
- Implementation details
- Best practices
- Case studies

## 6. Channel Discovery
- Process and mechanisms
- Detailed steps and examples

## 7. Adjacency Discovery
- Registrar and Enrollee roles
- Key generation (e.g., 3072-bit RSA key)
- Detailed steps and examples

## 8. Secure Channel Establishment
- Steps to establish a secure channel
- Security protocols and measures

## 9. Configuration and Setup
### Registrar Configuration
- Example: 
  ```plaintext
  autonomic registrar
  domain-id ERNW.de
  whitelist flash:whitelist.txt
  CA local
  no shut
  autonomic
  ```

### Enrollee Configuration
- Required settings and configurations

## 10. Autonomic Effects
- Impact on network management
- Benefits and challenges

## 11. Security Considerations
- Are you in control?
- Under the hood: detailed security mechanisms

## 12. Live Chat Support
### Issue 1: Secure Channel Between Different Domains
- **Me:** "Hi, I connected 2 nodes from 2 different domains and they built the secure channel!"
- **Support:** "Thanks for reporting, we created BugID CSCvd15717. We will check with the BU for that."
- **Support (follow-up):** "The BU responded that as both have a certificate signed by the same CA, they can connect."
- **Me:** "Wait, what about different domains? This shouldn’t be possible."
- **Support:** "We will add a feature to check domains in the future!"

### Issue 2: Certificate Revocation
- **Me:** "Hi, I can’t revoke the certificate of one of the accepted nodes."
- **Support:** "We will check that. Please note that the revoking of certificates is not supported on local CA."
- **Support (follow-up):** "We created CVE-2017-6664 for that."

### Issue 3: Remote Reset of Secure Channel
- **Me:** "Hi, the attacker can reset remotely the secure channel every time they are created, and the information is also in plain text!"
- **Support:** "We created CVE-2017-6665 for that."

### Issue 4: Node Crash Due to Multiple Resets
- **Me:** "Hi, if the attacker resets the channel multiple times, eventually the node crashes down!"
- **Support:** "We created CVE-2017-6663 for that."

### Issue 5: Invalid Enrollee IDs
- **Me:** "Hi, the attacker can crash the registrar by sending invalid enrollee IDs."
- **Support:** "We created CVE-2017-3849 for that."

## 13. Identified Vulnerabilities
- **CVE-2017-6664:** Certificate revocation issue
- **CVE-2017-6665:** Remote reset of secure channel
- **CVE-2017-6663:** Node crash due to multiple resets
- **CVE-2017-3849:** Crashing the registrar with invalid enrollee IDs
- **DeathKiss!**
- **CVE-2017-3850:** Additional vulnerability

## 14. Conclusion
