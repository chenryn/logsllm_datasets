### Electron Version
^11.0.1

### Operating System
macOS Big Sur, 11.0.1

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
None (also tested in 12.0.0)

### Expected Behavior
I have added two `BrowserView` instances to a `BrowserWindow` using the `addBrowserView` method on the `BrowserWindow` instance. Ideally, both `BrowserView` instances should be interactable, allowing me to focus and enter text in either of them. Additionally, both `BrowserView` instances should respond to click events.

### Actual Behavior
Only one of the `BrowserView` instances is interactable. The `BrowserView` on the left works as expected, but the one on the right is frozen and does not respond to any click events or input.
