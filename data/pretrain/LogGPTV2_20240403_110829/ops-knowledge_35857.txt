User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where does Cron checks the time zone on Debian? I have seen number of topics that are related to my question, but non of them answers it.

Where does Cron look-up the time zone ?

root@awesome:~# date
Fri Feb 17 14:02:02 EET 2012

root@awesome:~# hwclock -r
Fri 17 Feb 2012 14:03:39 EET  -0.815689 seconds


But the Cron still works on GMT zone. (I have to make every cron job +2h to make it run properly on time)

Is there mistakes in time-zone configuration ? Or there are more time-zone configuration on Debian Linux, and I am configurationg in on the wrong one ? (I have configured my time zone via tzselect

Assistant: You have to restart the cron daemon to the change in timezone to take effort for cron.

  Restarting Daemons and Long-Running Programs
  
  After the zoneinfo files are updated, you may need to restart daemons
  and other long-running programs to get them to use the new zone
  information. Examples of such programs include apache, bind, cron,
  fetchmail -d, inetd, mailman, sendmail, and sysklogd. A common symptom
  of this problem is seeing incorrect timestamps mixed in with the
  correct timestamps in your log files (e.g. /var/log/syslog). Even
  interactive programs like "mutt" may continue to use the old timezone
  information until they are restarted.
