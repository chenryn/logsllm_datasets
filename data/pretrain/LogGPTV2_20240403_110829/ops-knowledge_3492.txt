User: Set up server firewall rules to ensure server security and privacy.
Assistant: 1. Minimize open ports: Only open necessary ports, such as HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), SSH(22), SMTP(25), FTP(21), DNS(53), etc. Close unnecessary ports, such as RPC ports, NetBIOS, etc. 2. Restrict the IP addresses entering and leaving: Set up the IP address whitelist and blacklist on the server, only the IP addresses in the whitelist can enter and leave the server. IP addresses in the blacklist will be refused connections. 3. Enable SYN attack protection: Set the SYN attack strategy to prevent attackers from using some loopholes in the TCP protocol to initiate SYN attacks and cause the server to crash. 4. Disable the ICMP protocol: Set firewall rules to disable the ICMP protocol, which can prevent attackers from using tools such as ping to detect the server. 5. Limit TCP connections: Set firewall rules to limit the maximum number of TCP connections, to prevent attackers from using a large number of TCP connections to occupy server resources. 6. Enable IPsec encrypted communication: Enable IPsec encrypted communication, so that the communication between the server and the client can be safely encrypted to prevent information from being stolen. 7. Prohibit the use of unsafe protocols: Set firewall rules to prohibit the use of unsafe protocols, such as Telnet, FTP, etc., to prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive information of the server through these protocols. 8. Set up access control: Set up access control to only allow authorized users to access, and at the same time strengthen password management, set complex passwords and change passwords regularly. 9. Regularly update the firewall rules: Regularly update the firewall rules, check the loopholes and inapplicable rules in the firewall rules in time, and maintain the security and privacy of the server.
