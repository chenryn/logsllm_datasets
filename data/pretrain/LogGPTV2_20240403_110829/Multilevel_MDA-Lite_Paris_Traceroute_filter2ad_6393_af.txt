Our work builds on Paris Traceroute [15, 48] and the Multipath Detection Algorithm (MDA) [17, 47]. It also aligns with a series of measurement studies aimed at enhancing our ability to trace the IP-level paths that packets take through the Internet. For instance, Reverse Traceroute [32] uses the IP Record Route option to capture IP addresses on the return path of probe replies. Vanaubel et al.’s Network Fingerprinting technique [46] examines the Time-to-Live (TTL) values of probe replies to infer the type of router that sent them. When combined with the examination of the MPLS label stack in ICMP Time Exceeded messages, this technique can trace MPLS tunnels. Dublin Traceroute [20] employs a unique approach to identify NAT boxes on multipath routes by analyzing the IP ID field of probe replies [21].

Similarly, our multilevel route tracing technique extends beyond the interface level to uncover detailed information about the devices through which packets pass.

### Multilevel Route Tracing
Our multilevel route tracing leverages existing alias resolution techniques, particularly Midar’s [33] Monotonic Bounds Test (MBT), which compares overlapping time series of IP IDs from probe replies. The MBT builds on earlier approaches by Ally [44] and RadarGun [22]. We also utilize Vanaubel et al.’s Network Fingerprinting [46]. However, we do not employ other alias resolution methods such as Mercator [27] and iffinder [30], which are based on Pansiot and Grad’s technique [39] of checking whether a probe to one IP address elicits a reply from another. Additionally, we do not use Sherry et al.’s prespecified timestamp technique [41] or Spring et al.’s method [43] of examining reverse DNS lookups for similarities, as these require hand-designed rules reflecting each ISP's naming conventions. Graph analysis-based alias resolution techniques like APAR [28], kapar [5], and DisCarte [42] are also not used, as they analyze route traces from multiple sources to multiple destinations.

### Fakeroute Simulator
Fakeroute is a purpose-built network simulator designed for statistical validation of multipath route detection algorithm implementations across various topologies. Unlike general network simulators such as ns-3 [29] or emulators like GNS3 [4], which can run real router operating systems, Fakeroute focuses solely on multipath route detection.

### Surveys of Load-Balanced Paths
Our surveys update and expand upon previous work, such as Augustin et al.’s survey [19] from ten years ago. Similar to Marchetta et al.’s survey [37], our work transforms IP-level traces into router-level topologies. However, we achieve this with a single tool during the tracing process, rather than using additional measurements from other tools post hoc. Almeida et al. characterized multipath routes in the IPv6 Internet [14], but our tool currently only supports IPv4. While Marchetta et al. and Almeida et al.’s surveys are recent (from 2016 and 2017, respectively), they report a maximum of 16 interfaces per hop, whereas our survey reveals up to 96.

### Multipath Route Tracing on RIPE Atlas
Despite resource constraints, RIPE Atlas can implement a rudimentary form of MDA. In repeated route tracing measurements, a level of flow ID variation is allowed, with up to 64 variations of the Paris ID. Measurements are generally scheduled conservatively, allowing a probe box to cycle through 64 distinct Paris IDs over minutes or hours. This approach enables RIPE Atlas to discern multiple forward paths between a source and destination, though it does so without optimizing probe savings or statistical guarantees. This limitation motivated our search for an improved, reduced-overhead MDA.

### Conclusion and Future Work
This paper contributes four advancements related to Paris Traceroute, each with potential for further development:
1. **MDA-Lite**: An alternative to the MDA that significantly reduces overhead while maintaining low failure probability. We aim to deepen the mathematical analysis to determine significance levels and test the assumption of uniform load balancing.
2. **Fakeroute**: A simulator for validating multipath tracing software. Future work includes extending it to simulate exceptions to MDA and MDA-Lite assumptions, such as handling ICMP rate limiting and supporting multilevel route tracing.
3. **Multilevel Multipath Route Tracing**: Provides a router-level view of multipath routes. We continue to investigate the differences between direct and indirect probing for alias resolution.
4. **Surveys of Multipath Routing**: Our surveys show that load-balancing topologies have grown beyond previously reported sizes. Future work will involve repeating these surveys on a larger scale and comparing MDA and MDA-Lite more extensively.

Currently, our work is focused on IPv4, and we plan to extend it to IPv6.
