User: Please explain the principle, function and commonly used index types of database indexing.
Assistant: Database indexes have the following functions: 1. Improve query efficiency. 2. Ensure the uniqueness of the data. 3. Accelerate data insertion and modification operations. Index types include primary key index, unique index, common index, full-text index, composite index, and covering index. The primary key index is used to uniquely identify each record, which can improve the query speed of data. A unique index guarantees the uniqueness of the indexed column and allows null values. Ordinary index is the most basic index type, which can improve query efficiency. The full-text index is used to search text data, and can quickly find records containing keywords. A composite index is an index created on multiple columns, which can improve the query efficiency of multiple columns. The covering index contains all the data required by the query, which can avoid the operation of returning to the table of the query and improve the query efficiency.
