my project is about a self driving car by using an odroid-c2 and usb camera
,wich can detect barriers and Traffic lights !  
first step i succeed to realize the mjpeg streamer refering to this url:
forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=23503  
and at the end i got a real live video by accesing to http://ip-adress:port/  
now i want to link the output of the mjpeg streamer with the code of opencv :
i want to put the output of the mjpeg as an input of opencv for detecting to
carry on my project .So my question is :how can i include the output of mjpeg
streamer in the opencv code ??
