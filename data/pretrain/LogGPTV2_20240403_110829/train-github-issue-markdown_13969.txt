My project focuses on developing a self-driving car using an ODROID-C2 and a USB camera. The system is designed to detect barriers and traffic lights.

In the first phase, I successfully set up an MJPEG streamer by following the instructions provided in this forum post: [ODROID Forum - MJPEG Streamer Setup](http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=23503). As a result, I can now access the live video feed by navigating to `http://ip-address:port/`.

Now, I am looking to integrate the output from the MJPEG streamer into my OpenCV code. Specifically, I want to use the live video feed as an input for OpenCV to perform object detection. My question is: How can I include the output of the MJPEG streamer as an input in my OpenCV code?

Thank you for your assistance.
