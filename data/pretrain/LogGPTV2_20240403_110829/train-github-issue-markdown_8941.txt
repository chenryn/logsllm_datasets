    [x] bug report
**Current behavior**  
The promise of `whenStable` does resolve in time when used in an `async` test
with a reactive form and async validators. Code and unit tests within the
`whenStable` block do not run.  
However when using jasmines `done` callback instead of `async` the behavior is
correct
**Expected behavior**  
same as when using jasmines `done` callback
**Minimal reproduction of the problem**
