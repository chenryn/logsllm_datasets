**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Training

**Description:**
Implement user training programs to educate employees on recognizing and responding to common phishing and spearphishing tactics. Specifically, train users to identify suspicious file names, such as those with double extensions (e.g., `invoice.pdf.exe`). Additionally, raise awareness about other indicators of potentially malicious activities, and teach users how to report and handle suspicious events effectively. This proactive approach will help mitigate the risk of successful phishing attacks.
