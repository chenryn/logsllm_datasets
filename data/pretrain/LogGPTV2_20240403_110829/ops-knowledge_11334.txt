User: Please describe how to use cron job to run programs or scripts regularly in Linux system?
Assistant: Cron is a tool for timing tasks in Linux. Jobs can be scheduled to run at specified intervals by editing the cron table (a file read by the cron daemon). The following are the steps to use Cron jobs to run programs or scripts regularly in the Linux system: Step 1: Open the Cron table file. Cron table files are usually in the /etc/crontab file, or you can use the following command to open the Cron table: $ crontab -e Step 2: Set up scheduled tasks. Add new rows at the end of the opened Cron table and set up scheduled tasks if desired. The syntax is: ``` * * * * * command - - - - - | | | | | | | | | ----- Day of the Week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7) | | | ------- Month (1 - 12) | | --------- Day of the Month (1 - 31) | --------- Hour (0 - 23) --------------- Minute (0 - 59) ``` For example, if you want to run a script at 2 o'clock on the first day of every month, you can use the following syntax: 0 2 1 * * /path/to/script.sh Step 3: Save and exit the cron table file. Press Ctrl+X, then Y to save and exit. Now, the scheduled task that is set will run automatically at the specified time interval.
