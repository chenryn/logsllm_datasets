Question: In a TLS handshake, when a client and server aim to establish a secure communication channel, several steps are taken to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the connection. What are the purposes of generating a Premaster Secret (PS) and exchanging MACs over all messages sent during the handshake?
"A": "The Premaster Secret ensures that both the client and server have a shared key that is not known to eavesdroppers, and MACs guarantee message integrity by verifying that handshake messages have not been tampered with.",
"B": "The Premaster Secret is used to verify the server's certificate, and MACs are exchanged to authenticate the client to the server.",
"C": "The Premaster Secret prevents replay attacks, and MACs are used to determine the encryption algorithm for the session.",
"D": "The Premaster Secret is a form of client authentication, and MACs ensure that the handshake messages are received in the correct order."
Answer: A
