In this section we describe our method to increase the economic accuracy of service
activity time calculations. A costing approach can increase economic accuracy, when it supports
economic decisions by providing more precise information. We demonstrate this by extending
exponential smoothing (ES) with our customer factor approach. Exponential smoothing is a
standard forecasting method. Forecasting is a technique to predict future values and is associated
with operations research to provide input for decision making (Jensen, 2002). To monitor the
forecast accuracy we use statistical standard methods: the cumulative sum of forecast error
(CFE), the mean forecast error (MFE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute deviation
(MAD), root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
(Goetschalckx, 2011). The standard formula for ES calculate applied on a service co-creation is:
 =∗+−∗ (3)
The smoothing factor (0 ≤ ≤ 1) is used to change focus more on past observations
or current values. To integrate the customer factor approach we use the adjusted formula (4).
With the independent smoothing factor which is 0 ≤ ≤ 1. The customer factor weight
( ) is −1 ≤ ≤ 1. The proportional forecast error = ∗ is a parameter to
limit the forecasted value between and . and are necessary to limit the
impact of computed customer factors and not to over forecast. The adapted formula (4) is our
adapted exponential smoothing method to calculated
=∗+1−∗∗∗+1−∗∗∗ (4)

Evaluation Setting
We use the following hypotheses to test the adapted forecasting method, see (4).
: = where (compare to (3)) is the standard exponential smoothing method and
(compare to (4)) is the adapted method. : prevents forecasting too less human
resources. : The total sum of forecasted activity time with is higher compared to . To
obtain results we made the steps: (a) Select the service activities from our service use case, (b)
identify customer factors and map them on customer factors classes, (c) calculate for each
co-creation based on the provided operative data, (d) apply forecasting formulas and
(e) and use selected forecast error metrics. The results of one parameter combination are
illustrated in Table 1.

Results
The is not valid because of the results of and are always different.
Because of , we intentionally want our to over-forecast. A forecast model is over-
forecasting with  0, the model is said to under-forecast. In general an
ideal forecast model has a = 0. We can answer positive because of the =
−0.0092. Also is valid because the Sum of Activity Time (SAT) of is higher. Also
positive is that the Absolute Forecast Error (AFE) is higher with 58.46% for . This implies
that the financial loss with is smaller and more accurate for service costing.
CONCLUSIONS
The presented customer factor approach enables a service provider to compute more
accurate service costs. Based on our service use case we computed results that support our
assumptions. In about 60% of 1537 investigated co-creations, the customer factor approach
provided more accurate results compared to a standard forecasting method. Also the risk to under
forecast was lower with our approach.
Based on the results a service provider can derive detailed information about the required
level of customer involvement and activity time consumption. This information can be used to
plan required human resources and associated competencies.
In this paper we have demonstrated the applicability on one service scenario. To confirm
our results, and to show the applicability using different type of services, we are currently
applying our approach to additional services (software engineering and maintenance of
manufacturer of medical devices). In our further research activities, we want to find out, if a high
customer factor level increases the probability to reach forecasted activity time consumption.
Another activity is the application of regression analysis to analyze the dependency between
customer factors and activity time consumption.
