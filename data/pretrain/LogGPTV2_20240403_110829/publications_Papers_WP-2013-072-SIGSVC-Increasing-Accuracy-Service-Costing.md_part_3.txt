### Method for Increasing Economic Accuracy in Service Activity Time Calculations

In this section, we present a method to enhance the economic accuracy of service activity time calculations. A costing approach can improve economic accuracy by providing more precise information, thereby supporting better economic decisions. We demonstrate this improvement by extending the exponential smoothing (ES) technique with our customer factor approach.

#### Exponential Smoothing and Forecasting
Exponential smoothing is a standard forecasting method used to predict future values, which is often associated with operations research to provide input for decision-making (Jensen, 2002). To monitor forecast accuracy, we use several statistical metrics: cumulative sum of forecast error (CFE), mean forecast error (MFE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (Goetschalckx, 2011).

The standard formula for ES applied to a service co-creation is:
\[ \hat{y}_t = \alpha y_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha) \hat{y}_{t-1} \]
where \( \alpha \) (0 ≤ \( \alpha \) ≤ 1) is the smoothing factor, which determines the weight given to past observations versus current values.

To integrate the customer factor approach, we use the adjusted formula:
\[ \hat{y}_t = \alpha y_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha) \left( \beta \cdot \hat{y}_{t-1} + (1 - \beta) \cdot c_f \right) \]
where:
- \( \beta \) (0 ≤ \( \beta \) ≤ 1) is an independent smoothing factor.
- \( c_f \) (-1 ≤ \( c_f \) ≤ 1) is the customer factor weight.
- The proportional forecast error \( e_t = \frac{y_t - \hat{y}_t}{y_t} \) is a parameter to limit the forecasted value between \( y_t \) and \( \hat{y}_t \).
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are necessary to limit the impact of computed customer factors and prevent over-forecasting.

#### Evaluation Setting
We test the adapted forecasting method using the following hypotheses:
- **H1**: \( \hat{y}_t \neq \hat{y}_t' \) where \( \hat{y}_t \) (compare to (3)) is the standard ES method and \( \hat{y}_t' \) (compare to (4)) is the adapted method.
- **H2**: The adapted method prevents under-forecasting of human resources.
- **H3**: The total sum of forecasted activity time with \( \hat{y}_t' \) is higher compared to \( \hat{y}_t \).

To obtain results, we follow these steps:
1. Select service activities from our service use case.
2. Identify customer factors and map them to customer factor classes.
3. Calculate the co-creation based on provided operative data.
4. Apply the forecasting formulas.
5. Use selected forecast error metrics.

The results of one parameter combination are illustrated in Table 1.

| Accuracy Metric | Standard ES | Adapted ES |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| CFE             | 0.0328      | -14.1858   |
| MAD             | 0.9453      | 0.9687     |
| MSE             | 5.2516      | 5.8361     |
| RMSE            | 2.2916      | 2.4158     |
| MAPE            | 5.0953%     | 5.5273%    |
| MFE             | 0           | -0.0092    |
| SAT (in h)      | 506.8384    | 713.3862   |
| AFE             | 41.54%      | 58.46%     |

**Table 1. Comparison of Forecast Accuracy**

#### Results
- **H1** is valid because the results of \( \hat{y}_t \) and \( \hat{y}_t' \) are always different.
- **H2** is valid because the adapted method intentionally over-forecasts to prevent under-forecasting. An ideal forecast model has MFE = 0, and our MFE = -0.0092 indicates a slight under-forecast, but within acceptable limits.
- **H3** is valid because the Sum of Activity Time (SAT) of \( \hat{y}_t' \) is higher. Additionally, the Absolute Forecast Error (AFE) is higher with 58.46% for \( \hat{y}_t' \), implying that the financial loss with \( \hat{y}_t' \) is smaller and more accurate for service costing.

### Conclusions
Our customer factor approach enables service providers to compute more accurate service costs. Based on our service use case, the customer factor approach provided more accurate results in about 60% of 1,537 investigated co-creations compared to a standard forecasting method. The risk of under-forecasting was also lower with our approach.

Service providers can use this information to plan required human resources and associated competencies. We are currently applying our approach to additional services (e.g., software engineering and maintenance of medical devices) to confirm our results and demonstrate applicability across different types of services. Future research will explore whether a high customer factor level increases the probability of reaching forecasted activity time consumption and apply regression analysis to analyze the dependency between customer factors and activity time consumption.
