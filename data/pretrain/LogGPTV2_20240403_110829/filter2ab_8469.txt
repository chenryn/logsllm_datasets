### Title: Breaking Managed Data Services in the Cloud at Black Hat Asia 2023

**Abstract:**

The cloud has become the new operating system of the internet, with almost all companies leveraging it to host workloads and data. While there is extensive discussion on how to configure and maintain secure public cloud environments, there is a notable lack of security research into the core cloud infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in these core services can have significant impacts on customers.

In this presentation, we will share our research that led to two major discoveries: crossing tenant boundaries in two managed data services provided by the largest cloud vendors. Our research focused on two data integration services, where we were able to exploit vulnerabilities to obtain credentials for other customer accounts and execute code on remote machines.

We will discuss new types of vulnerabilities in cloud provider services, their anatomy, and the implications. We will explore how seemingly simple vulnerabilities can lead to substantial impacts, and yet, why it is still beneficial to be a cloud customer.
