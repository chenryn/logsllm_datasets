4 Results
4.1 Route Stability
Fig. 3 shows the cumulative distributions of distinct routes per pair and preva-
lence of dominant routes. The ﬁgures show that over 20% of the pairs in 2006
and almost 30% of the pairs in 2009 witness a single route. Fig. 3(b) has a clear
jump at 50% prevalence, which we attribute to load-balanced routes with equal
per-packet balancing. This jump is not visible in routes between academic end-
points, due to their minimal usage of load-balancers. Furthermore, over 55% of
the pairs that have both source and destination in academic ASes, which is the
case when using PlanetLab, have a single route. Pairs that have both end-points
in the USA have slightly higher route stability, with roughly 35% of them having
a single route. These observations stress the need for a diverse set of VPs when
doing e2e Internet analysis.
Analysis of the RouteISM (not shown due to lack of space) supports the
observation of an overall stable e2e routing in the Internet, as over 90% of the
pairs (and 95% of the academic pairs) have RouteISM smaller than 0.2. This
values is used in Sec. 4.2 as a threshold between stable and non-stable pairs.
4.2 Origin of Delay Instability
We ﬁrst show that our use of conﬁdence interval is meaningful. Fig. 4(a) plots
the cumulative distribution of the ratio between a route’s conﬁdence interval and
its mean delay. The ﬁgure shows that, for both years, 90% of the routes have a
ratio of less than 0.25. This indicates that the delay conﬁdence intervals are not
‘too long’ in general, and extend only for routes with large variance (as shown
in the examples in Fig. 1).
Fig. 4(b) shows that for both data sets, over 40% of the pairs have an overlap
of 1 and an additional 30% of the routes have overlap of over 0.8. Namely, in 70%

of the cases changes in route delay cannot be attributed to multiple path routing
but rather to changes between the routes. In 15% of the cases (20% in the 2006
data sets) the change in delay is mainly due to route changes as the overlap is zero
or close to 0. Over 95% of the pairs that have academic source and destination
ASes have an overlap of over 0.7. This is mainly the result of academic networks
having small routes diﬀerence (induced by local load-balancing) and little usage
of “spill-over” backup routes. Only 5% of the pairs that have both source and
destination in the USA witnessed overlap of 0.
Finally, we evaluate how the route stability aﬀects the overlap of delays.
Fig. 5(a) shows that routes with high RouteISM (≥ 0.2) have higher percentage
of non-overlap delay intervals. Namely, when the diﬀerence between the routes
is larger, there are higher chances that their delay distribution will be diﬀerent.
Fig. 5(b) shows that, unlike RouteISM, the prevalence of the dominant route
does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the level of overlap.

5 Conclusion
This work presents a measurement study of the e2e delay variance and its ori-
gins. Given a set of probed RTT delays, we ﬁnd a conﬁdence interval which
better captures the delay of each observed route. We then compute the overlap
of these intervals for uncovering the origin of these variations. Additionally, we
develop techniques for quantifying route stability and measure its aﬀect on the
origin of delay variance. We ﬁnd that for roughly 70% of the pairs and for over
95% of the academic pairs, the delay variations are mostly within the routes and
not between diﬀerent routes.
