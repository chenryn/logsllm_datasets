titleblackhat:asia-21 Reverse Engineering Compliance
A big part of reverse engineering is asking "how does this work?" That's usually a step on the way to asking "why does it work thatway?" or "how can I make this work for me?" And usually, we reverse machine code. But we can bring the same thinking to other things. We can look at a standard and figure out what it's trying to accomplish. That's useful for moving ourselves and our organizations away from a checkbox mentality to meeting the spirit of the requirement. And it turns out that a standard is also a subset of a threat model: answers to the question "what are we going to do about it?" Exposing that threat model will have all sorts of positive effects. Some of those come from just talking about the threat model, and more come from pushing standards bodies to do the right thing, and show their threat model. In this talk, Adam will show what he thinks makes up the PCI threat model, explain how he reverse engineered it, and talk about how the work exposes a way to replace the compliance mindset with threat informed defense.
