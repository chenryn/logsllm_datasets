It immediately follows that (cid:30) is true in both I and I 0. Consider the
following cases.
1. If (cid:30) is a ground logically signed rule, then (cid:30) is satisﬁed in
A; thus (cid:30) is satisﬁed
A; therefore (cid:30) is true in
every possible world in WA and in W 0
in every possible world in WA [ W 0
I (cid:8) I 0 at A.
2. Consequently, if (cid:30) is a logically signed rule, all its ground
instances will be true in I (cid:8) I 0 at A; thus (cid:30) is true in I (cid:8) I 0
at A.
3. If (cid:30) is a directly signed rule, its logically signed version is
true in I (cid:8) I 0 at A; if (cid:30) is not self-signed, then it is also in
both SA and S 0
A; therefore (cid:30) is
true in I (cid:8) I 0 at A.
A, which means (cid:30) 2 SA \ S 0
We conclude that I (cid:8) I 0 is a model for P.
DEFINITION 6
(INTERSECTION OPERATOR (cid:12)). For two in-
terpretations I and I 0 and peer A, we deﬁne
IA (cid:12) I 0
A = ((WA \ W 0
A) ; (SA [ S 0
A))
and further deﬁne
I (cid:12) I 0 = f(B; IB (cid:12) I 0
B) j B 2 N g:
PROPOSITION 2
(MODEL CLOSURE UNDER INTERSECTION).
The intersection I (cid:12) I 0 of any two models of P is still a model of
P.
This proposition can be proved using the arguments in the proof of
the previous proposition.
DEFINITION 7
((cid:22) RELATION). For two interpretations I and
I 0 and an arbitrary peer A, we deﬁne
IA (cid:22) I 0
A iff
(WA (cid:19) W 0
A) and(SA (cid:26) S 0
A):
Then we deﬁne I (cid:22) I 0 iff for all B 2 N ; IB (cid:22) I 0
upper bound for I.
B: We call I 0 an
The relation (cid:22) is reﬂexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric, hence
it is a partial order on interpretations. As examples, we have (I (cid:8)
I 0) (cid:22) I, and I (cid:22) (I (cid:12)I 0). The partial order has a maximal element
I1, in which each peer has no possible worlds and a set containing
all directly signed non-self-signed rules. We further deﬁne I (cid:30) I 0
iff I (cid:22) I 0 and I 6= I 0.
DEFINITION 8
(ISOLATED MODEL). The union of all models
of KB P is its isolated model, written P.
The isolated model reﬂects the viewpoint of each peer, consid-
ering only that peer’s local knowledge. A peer’s local reasoning is
performed with respect to its portion of an isolated model.
DEFINITION 9
(RELEASABILITY). A rule (cid:30) directly signed
by peer B is releasable from peer A to C in interpretation I iff (cid:30)
is true at IA and I j=A B lsigns srelease((cid:30); A; C).
DEFINITION 10
(STABILIZED INTERPRETATION). An inter-
pretation I is stabilized iff for all peers A, B, and C and all rules
(cid:30) that are directly signed by B, if (cid:30) is releasable from A to C, then
(cid:30) is true in I at C.
Intuitively speaking, every interesting message has already been
sent in a stabilized interpretation.
DEFINITION 11
(MESSAGES). We deﬁne global, local, (max-
imum) legal, and new messages as follows:
1. A global message M = f(A; MA) j A 2 N g, where MA
is a ﬁnite set of directly signed rules. A rule m in MA is a
local message for peer A. We omit the terms “global” and
“local” when the intent is clear from the context.
2. M is a new message for interpretation I iff there exists a peer
A and rule (cid:30) 2 MA, such that I 6j=A (cid:30).
3. M is a legal message for interpretation I iff for all peers A
and all rules (cid:30) 2 MA, there exists a peer B such that (cid:30) is
releasable in I from B to A.
4. M is the maximum legal message for I iff for every legal
message M 0 for I and for all peers A, M 0
A (cid:18) MA.
A global message is also a PeerAccess KB.
DEFINITION 12
(TRANSITION AND SUCCESSORS). We deﬁne
immediate successor relation ) (leads to), transition sequence,
fairness and eagerness as follows.
1. Interpretation I 0 is an immediate successor of I, denoted
I ) I 0, iff there exists a legal message M for I such that
(I (cid:12) M ) = I 0. In this case, we say I leads to I 0 by mes-
sage M, and M sends m to I 0 at A when m 2 MA. I 0 is a
non-trivial successor of I if M is a new message for I.
2. A sequence I1; I2; : : : of interpretations is a transition se-
quence iff I 1 ) I 2 ) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) .
3. A transition sequence is fair iff for each choice of j > 0,
each legal message M j for I j, every peer A, and every
rule m 2 M j
A, there exists an interpretation I l in the se-
quence that leads to I l+1 by sending legal message M l, and
m 2 M l
A. The intuition is that every possible local mes-
sage gets sent during the sequence, within a ﬁnite number of
transitions.
An interpretation can have more than one immediate successor.
Note that if I ) I 0, then I (cid:22) I 0.
DEFINITION 13
(UPPER BOUND). Let Seq be an inﬁnite se-
quence of interpretations I 1; I 2; : : : such that I 1 (cid:22) I 2 (cid:22) : : :. I is
an upper bound of Seq iff for all j, I j (cid:22) I.
PROPOSITION 3
(UPPER BOUND UNION CLOSURE WITH (cid:22)).
If I (cid:22) I a and I (cid:22) I b, then I (cid:22) (I a (cid:8) I b).
2. The union L (cid:12) L0 of two upper bounds for an interpretation
sequence Seq is still an upper bound for Seq.
Proof. (Part 1) Let W, W a, and W b be the corresponding sets of
possible worlds and let S, Sa, and Sb be the corresponding sets
of directly signed formulas. For all choices of peers A, I (cid:22) I a
and I (cid:22) I b imply that W (cid:19) W a and W (cid:19) W b; thus W (cid:19)
(W a [ W b). We obtain S (cid:18) (Sa \ Sb) similarly, and conclude
that I (cid:22) (I a (cid:8) I b). (Part 2) The desired result follows by applying
Part 1 to all interpretations in the sequence.
DEFINITION 14
(FIXPOINT). Let Seq be an inﬁnite sequence
of interpretations I 1; I 2; : : : such that I 1 (cid:22) I 2 (cid:22) : : :. The union
I (cid:3) of all upper bounds for Seq is Seq’s ﬁxpoint.
For every upper bound I for Seq, I (cid:3) (cid:22) I. Note that Seq does not
necessarily include the ﬁxpoint.
Let Seq be an inﬁnite transition sequence P; I 1; I 2; : : :. We say
that Seq is a transition sequence for P.
DEFINITION 15
(CANONICAL MODEL). P’s canonical model,
written P, is the intersection of the ﬁxpoints of all the transition se-
quences for P.
THEOREM 1
(PEERACCESS CONFLUENCE THEOREM). For
each inﬁnite transition sequence Seq for P and its ﬁxpoint I (cid:3), we
have:
1. I (cid:3) (cid:22) P.
2. I (cid:3) = P iff Seq is a fair transition sequence.
(Part 1.) By deﬁnition, P is the intersection of I (cid:3) and
Proof.
others, thus I (cid:3) (cid:22) P.
(Part 2.) Represent any two of these fair sequences E and F as
E 1 = P, E 2, ..., and F 1 = P, F 2, ....
Let m be a member of the set of directly signed formulas in
sequence E’s ﬁxpoint E (cid:3) at peer A. Then m has to be in some
Ei’s set of directly signed formulas at A. Otherwise, we can have
an upper bound E+ that has the same possible worlds and set of
directly signed formulas as E (cid:3), except that m is not in E+’s set
of directly signed formulas at A. In that case E + (cid:31) E (cid:3), which
contradicts the fact that E (cid:3) is the ﬁxpoint. So we can assume m
ﬁrst appears in E at Ei and is sent from B at Ei(cid:0)1.
Let the tuple (x, P , A), called a message delivery, represent the
fact that that peer P sent a local message x to A at transition E i(cid:0)1.
Let S be an empty stack, and push (m, B, A) onto S. Then for
each peer P that sent B a message during stage E i(cid:0)2, push a tuple
(x, P , B) onto the stack. Repeat the process for each message that
a peer P 0 sent to P or B at stage Ei(cid:0)3. Continue the process back
through each stage, pushing messages sent by (potentially more
and more) peers, until all relevant messages from the ﬁrst stage
have been pushed.
The resulting stack shows how m came to be delivered to A.
Each message in the stack is legal (releasable) if all messages above
it in the stack have already been sent. If we pop messages off the
stack one by one, we get a ﬁnite sequence of legal message deliv-
eries, (m1, B 1, A1), (m2, B 2, A2), : : :, (m, B, A.) Because F 1
equals E1, m1 must be releasable at F 1 from A1 to B 1. Under
the fairness assumption, this legal message must be sent at some
point in F ; say it happens at F r. After that point, m2 is releasable
from A2 to B 2, and the same argument as used for m1 implies that
m2 is eventually sent in F . Repeating this argument, we ﬁnd that
eventually m is sent in F ; say this happens in F k at A. Then m is
1.
also in F (cid:3) at A, as otherwise we would have a ﬁxpoint F + (cid:31) F (cid:3).
We conclude that E (cid:3) and F (cid:3) have the same sets of directly signed
formulas.
E and F start with the same set of possible worlds at A, and
every time a message is received at A, the elimination of possible
worlds (by intersecting with all possible worlds implied by the re-
ceived messages at A) is determined by the set of messages in A.
If a possible world w is in E 1 at A, but not in E (cid:3) at A, then it
must be eliminated from some E i at A because of a message m
received by Ei at A. As we have proved, m also gets delivered to
some F j, which eliminates w from F j at A and all F j’s succes-
sors. Thus w is not in F (cid:3) at A either. We conclude that E (cid:3) = F (cid:3),
which means that all of P’s fair transition sequences have the same
ﬁxpoint, written F.
We can use the same arguments to show that every local message
sent to A in an unfair transition sequence is also present in the set
of directly signed formulas at A in the ﬁxpoint of a fair transition
sequence, but not the other way around. Thus any unfair transition
sequence’s ﬁxpoint F 0 (cid:30) F, which means F (cid:12) F 0 = F. As P
is deﬁned as the union of all transition sequences’ ﬁxpoints, we
conclude that P = F.
For the other direction, we have already proved that for any un-
fair sequence for P and resulting ﬁxpoint F 0, we have F 0 (cid:31) P. It
follows that if a sequence’s ﬁxpoint is P, then this sequence must
be a fair sequence.
6. PROOF THEORY
We now turn our attention from what is truein the interpretations
of PeerAccess knowledge bases to what is provable.
DEFINITION 16
((LOCAL) DERIVATION). We have the follow-
ing local derivation rules to derive new information inside a par-
ticular peer A’s KB, PA:
(cid:15) Instantiation. From a logically signed rule (cid:30) in PA, derive
an instance of (cid:30).
(cid:15) Modus ponens. From the logically signed rule f   f1 ^
(cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ^ fm and facts f1 through fm, derive f.
(cid:15) Signature. From a rule logically signed by A, derive its di-
rectly signed counterpart.
(cid:15) Self-release. From a rule (cid:30) directly signed by B, derive “B
lsigns srelease((cid:30); A; B)” and “B lsigns srelease((cid:30); A; A)”.
(cid:15) Instantiation. If a logically signed rule (cid:30) is true in P at A,
then every instance of it is present in every possible world of
P at A, so every instance of it is also true in P at A.
(cid:15) Modus ponens. For every logically signed rule (cid:30) of the form
f   f1 ^ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ^ fm and facts f1 through fm, let f 0
1 through
f 0
m be corresponding ground instances. For every world w of
P at A, as all f 0
m are present in w, if f 0 is not in
w, then the rule (cid:30) is not true in w, which is a contradiction.
We conclude that f 0 is in w and f is true in P at A.
1 through f 0
(cid:15) Signature. If a ground rule (cid:30) logically signed by A is true
in P at A, the model theoretic deﬁnition of directly signed
rules tells us that (cid:30)’s directly signed counterpart is also true
at A.
(cid:15) Release. The remaining local derivation rules are for the
