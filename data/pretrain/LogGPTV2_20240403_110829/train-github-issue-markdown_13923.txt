The build process for the latest TypeScript-Material-React example is failing due to the `color="secondary"` parameter. Here are the details of the error and a potential solution:

### Error Details

**Error Message:**
```
create-react-app-with-typescript/src/pages/index.tsx
(61,17): Type '{ raised: true; color: "secondary"; onClick: () => void; children: string; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & ButtonProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'.
  Type '{ raised: true; color: "secondary"; onClick: () => void; children: string; }' is not assignable to type 'ButtonProps'.
    Types of property 'color' are incompatible.
      Type '"secondary"' is not assignable to type '"default" | "inherit" | "primary" | "accent" | "contrast" | undefined'.
```

**Failing Code:**
```tsx
<Button raised color="secondary" onClick={() => console.log("Super Secret Password")}>
  Super Secret Password
</Button>
```

### Solution

The `color` prop in the `Button` component does not accept `"secondary"` as a valid value. The valid values for the `color` prop are `"default"`, `"inherit"`, `"primary"`, `"accent"`, and `"contrast"`.

To resolve the issue, you can change the `color` prop to one of the valid values. For example:

**Working Code:**
```tsx
<Button raised color="primary" onClick={() => console.log("Super Secret Password")}>
  Super Secret Password
</Button>
```

Alternatively, if you need to use a secondary color, you may need to customize the theme or use a different approach to apply the desired color.
