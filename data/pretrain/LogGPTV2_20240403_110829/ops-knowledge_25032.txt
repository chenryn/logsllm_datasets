User: Please introduce what are the four major infrastructures of network security? what's the effect?
Assistant: The four basic infrastructures of network security include: firewall, intrusion detection system (IDS), virtual private network (VPN) and identity authentication (Authentication) system. 1. Firewall: Firewall is the first line of defense of network security, used to protect the network from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Its main function is to filter data packets entering and leaving the network, and can perform operations such as flow control and data packet filtering. The strategy is flexible and convenient, and different rules can be formulated according to different business needs to improve network security. 2. Intrusion Detection System (IDS): An IDS is a security device that monitors network traffic and is mainly used to detect network attacks and malformed traffic. It can monitor traffic according to the previously given rules, detect suspicious attacks in time, and issue alarm notifications for processing, improving network security defense. 3. Virtual private network (VPN): A virtual private network is a network that realizes secure communication through encryption and tunneling technology. protection and improve the security of data transmission. 4. Authentication system: The authentication system is a security mechanism for verifying user identities, which can verify user identities, control access rights, and reduce the risk of malicious attacks and data leakage. Its role is to ensure that all users accessing the network are authorized legal users to ensure data security.
