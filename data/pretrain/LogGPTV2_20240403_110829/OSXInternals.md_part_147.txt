### 11.7. Hybrid and Other File Systems in Mac OS X

#### 11.7.1. Creating and Mounting a Hybrid Image
To create a hybrid image that includes both HFS+ and ISO 9660 file systems, you can use the `hdiutil` command as follows:

```bash
$ hdiutil makehybrid -o /tmp/hybrid.iso . -hfs -iso -hfs-volume-name HFS -iso-volume-name ISO -hide-hfs iso.txt -hide-iso hfs.txt
Creating hybrid image...
```

This command creates a hybrid image at `/tmp/hybrid.iso` with the following properties:
- HFS+ volume named "HFS"
- ISO 9660 volume named "ISO"
- The file `iso.txt` is hidden from the HFS+ volume.
- The file `hfs.txt` is hidden from the ISO 9660 volume.

To attach and examine the hybrid image, use:

```bash
$ hdiutil attach -nomount /tmp/hybrid.iso
/dev/disk10 Apple_partition_scheme
/dev/disk10s1 Apple_partition_map
/dev/disk10s2 Apple_HFS
```

The partition map can be viewed with:

```bash
$ hdiutil pmap /dev/rdisk10
Partition List
## Dev_______ Type_______________ Name_____________ Start___ Size____ End_____
0 disk10s1 Apple_partition_map Apple 1 63 63
-1 Apple_ISO ISO 64 24 87
1 disk10s2 Apple_HFS DiscRecording 3.0 88 36 123
Legend
- ... extended entry
+ ... converted entry
```

If you explicitly mount the ISO 9660 file system, you will only see the `ISO.TXT` file:

```bash
$ mkdir /tmp/iso
$ mount -t cd9660 /dev/disk10 /tmp/iso
$ ls /tmp/iso
ISO.TXT
$ umount /tmp/iso
```

If you mount it as an HFS+ volume, you will only see the `hfs.txt` file:

```bash
$ hdiutil detach disk10
$ open /tmp/hybrid.iso
$ ls /Volumes/HFS
hfs.txt
```

Apple's ISO 9660 implementation stores resource forks as associated files with a `._` prefix.

#### 11.7.2. MS-DOS File System
Mac OS X supports the FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 variants of the MS-DOS file system. This support is provided via a loadable kernel extension (`/System/Library/Extensions/msdosfs.kext`).

To create and mount an MS-DOS file system:

```bash
$ hdiutil create -size 32m -fs MS-DOS -volname MS-DOS /tmp/ms-dos.dmg
$ hdiutil attach /tmp/ms-dos.dmg
/dev/disk10 /Volumes/MS-DOS
$ hdiutil pmap /dev/rdisk10
## Dev_______ Type_______________ Name_____________ Start___ Size____ End_____
-1 disk10 MS-DOS Single Volume 0 65536 65535
```

Mac OS X supports symbolic links on the MS-DOS file system by storing link-target information in a specially formatted text file. For example, to create a symbolic link:

```bash
$ echo -n target.txt | md5
4d6f333d2bc24ffddcca34414a0cb12d
```

You may need to unmount and remount the volume for the file system to recognize the file as a symbolic link.

#### 11.7.3. NTFS
Mac OS X includes read-only support for NTFS. The NTFS driver (`/System/Library/Extensions/ntfs.kext`) is based on the FreeBSD NTFS driver and is loaded by the `mount_ntfs` program when required.

#### 11.7.4. UDF
Universal Disk Format (UDF) is used by DVD-ROM discs and many CD-R/RW packet-writing programs. It is implemented as a kernel extension (`/System/Library/Extensions/udf.kext`) and is loaded by the `mount_udf` program when required. Mac OS X 10.4 supports the "normal" flavor of the UDF 1.5 specification.

#### 11.7.5. UFS
UFS (Unix File System) in Darwin is similar to that in FreeBSD but is always big-endian, even on little-endian hardware. UFS does not support multiple forks, native extended attributes, or aliases. However, resource forks and extended attributes can be emulated. For example, a file with a nonzero resource fork copied to a UFS volume is split into two files: one for the data fork and one for the resource fork.

UFS2, a newer version of UFS, provides several improvements such as 64-bit block pointers and support for extended attributes. Unlike HFS+, UFS is case-sensitive and supports sparse files.

To compare HFS+ and UFS, consider creating two 16MB disk images and attempting to create a 32MB sparse file on each:

```bash
$ hdiutil create -size 16m -fs HFS -volname HFS hfs.dmg
$ hdiutil create -size 16m -fs UFS -volname UFS ufs.dmg
$ open hfs.dmg
$ open ufs.dmg
$ cd /Volumes/HFS
$ df -k .
Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Avail Capacity Mounted on
/dev/disk10s2 16337 261 16076 2% /Volumes/HFS
$ mkfile -nv 32m bigfile
mkfile: (bigfile removed) Write Error: No space left on device
$ cd /Volumes/UFS
$ df -k .
Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Avail Capacity Mounted on
/dev/disk11s2 15783 15 14979 0% /Volumes/UFS
$ mkfile -nv 32m bigfile
bigfile 33554432 bytes
$ ls -lh bigfile
-rw------- 1 amit amit 32M Oct 22 11:40 bigfile
$ df -k .
Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Avail Capacity Mounted on
/dev/disk11s2 15783 27 14967 0% /Volumes/UFS
```

Although Mac OS X supports UFS as a root file system, HFS+ is recommended for better integration with the operating system's features.

#### 11.7.6. AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)
AFP is a protocol for file sharing over the network, primarily used between Mac OS X systems. It is implemented in a loadable kernel extension (`/System/Library/Filesystems/AppleShare/afpfs.kext`). AFP supports multiple User Authentication Methods (UAMs) and Unix-style access privileges.

#### 11.7.7. FTP
The `mount_ftp` command allows you to mount a directory on an FTP server locally:

```bash
$ mount_ftp ftp://user:password@host/directory/path local-mount-point
```

The FTP file system is implemented as a user process that acts as both an FTP client and a local NFS server, using NFS to export the FTP view.

#### 11.7.8. NFS
Mac OS X derives its NFS client and server support from FreeBSD, conforming to NFS version 3 and including NQNFS extensions. The supporting daemons include `rpc.lockd`, `rpc.statd`, and `nfsiod`.

NQNFS adds statefulness to NFS, using leases to facilitate server recovery of client state in the event of a crash.

#### 11.7.9. SMB/CIFS
SMB (Server Message Block) is a widely used protocol for sharing resources over a network. Mac OS X provides support for SMB/CIFS through Samba, an Open Source SMB server.

#### 11.7.10. WebDAV
WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of HTTP that allows collaborative file management on the web. You can mount a WebDAV-enabled directory using the `mount_webdav` command:

```bash
$ mkdir /tmp/idisk
$ mount_webdav http://idisk.mac.com// /tmp/idisk
$ ls /tmp/idisk
About your iDisk.rtf Movies Sites
Backup Music Software
Documents Pictures
Library Public
```

Mac OS X also supports secure WebDAV using Kerberos and HTTPS.

#### 11.7.11. cdda
The `cdda` file system makes the tracks of an audio compact disc appear as AIFF files. It is implemented with a mounting utility (`mount_cddafs`) and a loadable file system kernel extension (`/System/Library/Extensions/cddafs.kext`).

This completes the overview of various file systems supported by Mac OS X, including their creation, mounting, and specific features.
