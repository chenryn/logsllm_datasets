ABSTRACT
Service level agreements (SLAs) deﬁne performance guarantees
made by service providers, e.g, in terms of packet loss, delay, delay
variation, and network availability. In this paper, we describe a new
active measurement methodology to accurately monitor whether
measured network path characteristics are in compliance with per-
formance targets speciﬁed in SLAs. Speciﬁcally, (1) we describe a
new methodology for estimating packet loss rate that signiﬁcantly
improves accuracy over existing approaches; (2) we introduce a
new methodology for measuring mean delay along a path that im-
proves accuracy over existing methodologies, and propose a method
for obtaining conﬁdence intervals on quantiles of the empirical de-
lay distribution without making any assumption about the true dis-
tribution of delay; (3) we introduce a new methodology for mea-
suring delay variation that is more robust than prior techniques;
and (4) we extend existing work in network performance tomog-
raphy to infer lower bounds on the quantiles of a distribution of
performance measures along an unmeasured path given measure-
ments from a subset of paths. We unify active measurements for
these metrics in a discrete time-based tool called SLAM. The uni-
ﬁed probe stream from SLAM consumes lower overall bandwidth
than if individual streams are used to measure path properties. We
demonstrate the accuracy and convergence properties of SLAM in
a controlled laboratory environment using a range of background
trafﬁc scenarios and in one- and two-hop settings, and examine its
accuracy improvements over existing standard techniques.

increasingly common for SLAs to specify transport-level perfor-
mance assurances using metrics such as packet loss, delay, delay
variation, and network availability [2, 3, 4, 33]. Meeting SLA guar-
antees results in revenue for the ISP. However, failing to meet SLA
guarantees can result in credits to the customer. The implications
of not meeting SLA guarantees are therefore serious: a disruption
in service can result in signiﬁcant revenue loss to both the customer
and provider. SLA compliance monitoring, assessing whether per-
formance characteristics are within speciﬁed bounds, is therefore
critical to both parties.
Compliance monitoring is a critical challenge for SLA engineer-
ing. SLAs must be designed that can be accurately and efﬁciently
monitored, while simultaneously limiting the risk of non-compliance.
For example, assuring a low loss rate might be possible only if loss
rates can be estimated with sufﬁciently high conﬁdence. Although
passive measurements (e.g., via SNMP) may provide high accuracy
for a metric such as loss on a link-by-link basis, they may be insuf-
ﬁcient for estimating the performance of customer trafﬁc. Thus, al-
though there are situations where active measurements may be too
heavyweight or yield inaccurate results [10, 31, 35], they nonethe-
less remain a key mechanism for SLA compliance monitoring.
In this paper, we address the following questions: can SLA com-
pliance along a path be accurately monitored with a single lightweight
probe stream? and can this stream be the basis for efﬁcient network-
wide compliance monitoring? There have been a large number of
active measurement methodologies proposed to estimate transport-
level performance characteristics. Nonetheless, there has been little
work to directly address the speciﬁc problem of SLA compliance
monitoring. In this context, measurement accuracy, ability to re-
port conﬁdence bounds, ability to quickly adapt to changing net-
work conditions, and ability to efﬁciently assess performance on a
network-wide basis are of great importance.
The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new
active measurement methodology to accurately assess whether mea-
sured network path characteristics are in compliance with speciﬁed
targets. We describe a heuristic technique for estimating packet
loss rate along a path that signiﬁcantly improves accuracy over ex-
isting approaches. Second, we introduce a new method for mea-
suring mean delay along a path that is more accurate than exist-
ing methodologies. We also develop a mathematical foundation
for obtaining conﬁdence intervals for the quantiles of the empirical
delay distribution. Third, we introduce a new method for mea-
suring delay variation that is more robust than prior techniques.
These probe algorithms are uniﬁed in a multi-objective discrete-
time based tool called SLAM (SLA Monitor), which was sketched
in an earlier workshop paper [36]. That paper was limited to intro-
ducing SLAM’s architectural framework and outlining the loss rate
measurement heuristic used by SLAM.
The second contribution of this paper is to extend prior work in
the area of performance tomography toward the goal of network-
wide SLA compliance monitoring.
In particular, we develop a
methodology to infer lower bounds on the quantiles of a distri-
bution of path performance measures using measurements from a
subset of network paths.
We demonstrate the properties of SLAM in a controlled labora-
tory environment using a range of background trafﬁc scenarios and
using both one- and two-hop topologies. We compare SLAM’s de-
lay and loss estimation accuracy with standard IPPM probe method-
ologies [7, 8] of the same rate, and examine the convergence and
robustness of SLAM estimates of delay, delay variation, and loss.
Our experiments show that our estimates of mean delay are within
one msec of the true mean delay, while the standard probe method-
ology [7] can suffer inaccuracies up to about a factor of two. We
also show that for a conﬁdence level of 90%, SLAM’s estimated
bounds on a wide range of delay quantiles, with few exceptions,
include the true quantile value. We show that in a simple two-hop
topology, the inferred bound on the delay distribution is tight, and
close to the actual distribution. Our experiments also reveal that
SLAM estimates the end-to-end loss rate with high accuracy and
with good conﬁdence bounds. For example, in a scenario using
self-similar background trafﬁc, the true loss rate over a 15 minute
period is 0.08% and the SLAM estimate is 0.07%.
In contrast,
the standard method for estimating loss rate [8] can have errors of
more than two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the robustness
of SLAM’s delay variation monitoring methodology, showing how
the existing standard RTP jitter metric [32] may be too sensitive
to network path conditions, and that SLAM performs well in our
more complex two-hop scenario.
2. RELATED WORK
General aspects and structure of SLAs have been discussed in [27,
33]. Performance assurances provided by SLAs range from net-
work path availability, to transport-level metrics, to application-
speciﬁc metrics. These guarantees may be based on a variety of
statistics of the particular metric, such as the mean, median, or a
high quantile, computed over various time scales. Examples of the
kinds of guarantees offered by service providers are available on-
line [2, 3, 4].
To ensure that SLA performance targets are met with high proba-
bility, service providers collect measurements either passively within
the network, by injecting measurement probes into the network,
or by using a combination of both [6, 13, 18, 42]. While active
measurement-based compliance monitoring has received some at-
tention in the past, e.g., [18], there has been little validation in
realistic environments where a reliable basis for comparison can
be established. There has been limited work addressing the ac-
curacy of some active measurement approaches; exceptions are
found in [10, 31, 35]. The issue of accuracy clearly has serious
implications for SLA compliance monitoring. Other efforts have
been limited in focus to estimation and optimization of a single
metric, e.g., [16, 19]. Our work takes an active measurement ap-
proach, focusing on simultaneous, or multi-objective, measurement
of transport-level performance metrics. We further differentiate our
work through validation in a controlled, realistic testbed.
In general, there has been a great deal of work on active mea-
surements of end-to-end delay, delay variation, and loss, e.g., [7,
8, 11, 19, 21, 28, 29, 30, 40, 41].
IETF standardization efforts for
active measurement of delay, delay variation, loss, and reordering
have taken place within the IETF IPPM working group [7,8,21,30].
Regarding delay, our method for distribution quantile estimation is
distinguished from the earlier work of Choi et al. [16] in that we
do not require the quantile of interest to be speciﬁed a priori, and
that we do not make any assumption regarding the underlying de-
lay distribution. As a result, our method is robust to abrupt changes
in underlying network conditions. Lastly, we note that our formu-
lation of a delay variation measurement methodology stands apart
from the related IPPM [21] and real-time protocol (RTP) [32] spec-
iﬁcations in that rather than considering highly localized variations
in delay (e.g., between consecutive probe packets), we consider de-
lay variations over streams of packets.
3. PATH-ORIENTED SLA COMPLIANCE
MONITORING
We now describe the basic assumptions and methods for estimat-
ing delay, delay variation, and loss along a single end-to-end path.
Our objective is to develop accurate, robust estimators based on a
discrete-time probe process. Moreover, we seek to improve on the
best known standard IPPM methodologies [7, 8, 32]. Another met-
ric that is often part of SLA speciﬁcations is network availability.
Availability can be loosely deﬁned as the capability of the network
to successfully transmit any end-to-end probe over an interval of
time, e.g., 60 seconds [26]. Although availability may be consid-
ered as a special case of loss, we have yet to examine this metric in
detail.
3.1 Delay
Both mean delay and high quantiles of the empirical delay dis-
tribution are used in SLAs. We ﬁrst consider estimation of mean
delay along a path, which we model as a continuous function f (t)
whose independent variable is the time that a probe packet is sent
and the dependent variable is measured one-way delay. Based on
this model, a natural approach to mean delay estimation is to use
Simpson’s method for numerical integration. The Simpson’s for-
mulation is straightforward: once the domain of integration is par-
titioned, the integral of the function f over the subinterval I j is
estimated by 1
6 ( f (a j) + f (b j) + 4 f (c j)), with a j, b j the endpoints
of I j, and with c j its midpoint. The error of the Simpson estimate
is known to be e j = f (4)(ξj)
2880 |I j|5, with ξj some point in the interval
I j. Thus, if the fourth derivative of f exists and is not too large, it is
safe to state that the local error is of order 5; i.e., if we double the
number of samples, the error in the estimate will be reduced locally
by a factor of 32, and globally by a factor of 16.
To apply Simpson’s method to a discrete-time probe process for
estimating mean end-to-end delay, we do the following: at time slot
i, we draw a value k from a geometric distribution with parameter
pdelay. The geometric distribution is the discrete analog of the ex-
ponential distribution and should yield unbiased samples. Probes
representing the endpoints a j and b j are sent at time slots i and
i + 2(k + 1) with the midpoint probe sent a time slot i + (k + 1). At
time slot i + 2(k + 1) the next subinterval begins, thus the last probe
of a given subinterval is the ﬁrst probe of the next one. Simpson’s
estimates from each subinterval are summed to form the total area
under the delay function. The mean delay estimate is then obtained
by dividing the integral estimate by the number of subintervals.
With the above formulation, the subintervals are not of equal
lengths (the lengths form a geometric distribution). Thus, we can
either directly apply Simpson’s method to estimate the mean de-
lay, or we can apply relative weights to the subintervals according
to their lengths. In our results described below, we use weighted
subintervals which we found to give more accurate results, though
the absolute differences were small.
There are several considerations in using this approach. First,
probes may be lost in transit. We presently discard subintervals
where probe loss occurs. Second, while the assumption that delay
largely behaves as a smooth function seems reasonable, it may be
more accurate to account for random spikes in delay by modeling
the process as the sum of two processes, one smooth and one ran-
dom. For example, if the function f (t) is written as f1(t) + f2(t),
with f1 smooth and f2 random, then our numerical integration does
much better on f1 and slightly worse on f2 as compared to straight
averaging. The Simpson’s approach should be effective for this
model as well:
if the values of the random part are quite small
compared to the smooth part, then our estimate should be better
than simple averaging (i.e., the sampling method advocated in RFC
2679 [7]). Note that there is little risk in using Simpson’s method:
even if delay is a completely random process (which is not likely),
the variance of the Simpson’s rule estimator for mean delay is in-
creased only slightly as compared to simple averaging.
Distribution-Free Quantile Estimation. Besides using mean delay
as the basis of service-level guarantees, ISPs also use high quantiles
of the delay distribution, such as the 95th percentile [16].
Let {xi :
i = 1, . . . , n} be n independent samples drawn at ran-
dom from a common distribution F, sorted in increasing order. For
simplicity, assume F is continuous. Let Qp denote the pth quantile
of that distribution, i.e., the unique solution of F(Qp) = p.
We wish to obtain conﬁdence intervals for Qp based on {xi}.
One approach would be to start with the empirical distribution func-
tion: bF(x) = n−1#{i : xi ≤ x} and use a quantile estimate of the form
bQp = max{x : bF(x) ≤ p}. Analysis of the variance of this estimator
might give us asymptotic conﬁdence intervals as n becomes large.
Instead, we seek rigorous probabilistic bounds on Qp that hold for
all n.
Pr[xk ≤ Qp] = G(n, p, k).
Now {xk ≤ x} is the event that at least k of the samples are less
than or equal to x, an event which has probability G(n, F(x), k),
j(cid:17). Taking x = Qp we have
where G(n, p, k) = ∑ j≥k p j(1− p)n− j(cid:16) n
Based on the xi, we now wish to determine a level X +(n, p,ε)
that the true quantile Qp is guaranteed to exceed only with some
small probability ε. Thus, we chose X +(n, p,ε) = xK +(n,p,ε) with
K+(n, p,ε) = min{k : G(n, p, k) ≤ ε}.
Similarly, Pr[xk ≥ Qp] = 1 − G(n, p, k). Based on the xi, we
now wish to determine a level X −(n, p,ε) that the true quantile
Qp is guaranteed to fall below only with some small probability ε.
Thus, we chose X −(n, p,ε) = xK −(n,p,ε) with K−(n, p,ε) = max{k :
1 − G(n, p, k) ≤ ε}.
Put another way, K+(n, p,ε) is the 1 −ε quantile of the binomial
Bn,p distribution, while K−(n, p,ε) is the ε quantile of the binomial
Bn,p distribution. The K± can be computed exactly; examples are
given in Table 1.

3.2 Delay Variation
Characterizing delay variation in a complex setting and in a com-
pact and robust way is a challenging problem. In looking for a suit-
able model for delay variation (DV), we found that the notion itself
is deﬁned in multiple ways. For example, IPPM RFC 3393 [21]
refers on the one hand to the variation of delay with respect to some
reference metric, such as the average or minimum observed delay,
and on the other hand to the dynamics of queues along a path or at
a given router. DV samples in RFC 3393 are deﬁned as the differ-
ence in one-way delays of packet i and packet j, Di − D j. These
two packets may be consecutive packets of a probe stream, but they
need not be. A statistic of interest identiﬁed by the RFC is the em-
pirical distribution of DV samples, the mean of which is sometimes
used in SLAs. Maximum DV is also of importance, as it may be
useful for sizing playout buffers for streaming multimedia applica-
tions such as voice and/or video over IP [24].
An alternative deﬁnition of delay variation is found in the Real-
time Protocol (RTP) standard, RFC 3550 [32]. It uses an exponen-
tially weighted moving average over the absolute one-way delay
differences, j(i) = j(i − 1) + (|Di − Di−1| − j(i − 1))/16, where Di
is the one-way delay of packet i, and j(0) = 0. The RTP jitter value
is intended for use as a measure of congestion. Rather than being
used as a meaningful absolute value, it is meant to be used as a
mechanism for qualitative comparison of multiple RTP stream re-
ceivers, or at different points of time at a single receiver. We posit
that a DV estimator that can capture dynamic conditions has more
direct relevance to applications and is therefore more meaningful
to SLAs.
Building on these notions of delay variation, we consider a stream
of probes of length k, e.g., 100 probes. We denote the time differ-
ence between two probes i and j when they are sent as si, j and
the time difference between the same two probes when they are
received as ri, j. We construct a matrix M where each cell Mi, j con-
tains the ratio ri, j/si, j. Thus, Mi, j is 1 if the spacing between probes
i and j does not change; is greater than 1 if the measured spacing
increases; or is less than 1 if the measured spacing decreases as the
probes traverse the network path. (Ratio ri, j/si, j is deﬁned as 1 for
i = j and it is deﬁned as 0 if probe i or j is lost.) Note that com-
puting the above ratio ri, j/si, j with respect to consecutive probes in
the stream gives a more accurate description of the instantaneous
nature of DV while probes farther apart give a description of DV
over longer time intervals.
Next, we compute the eigenvalues of this matrix M, resulting in
a vector e of length k, with values sorted from largest to smallest.
If the probe stream traverses the network undisturbed, we would
expect that matrix M would consist entirely of 1s, with the largest
eigenvalue as k and all other eigenvalues as 0; we denote the vector
of these “expected” eigenvalues as e′. We subtract e′ from e, tak-
ing the L1 norm of the resulting vector: ∑k
i|. We refer to
this L1 norm as our DV matrix metric. As with RTP, it is not in-
tended to be meaningful in an absolute sense but useful for relative
comparisons over time.
i=1 |ei − e′
The DV matrix formulation relies on and is motivated by the
fact that we have a notion of what is expected in the absence of
turbulence along the path, i.e., that probe spacings should remain
undisturbed. By looking at the eigenstructure of the DV matrix, we
extract, in essence, the amount of distortion from what we expect.
3.3 Loss
The loss metric speciﬁed by SLAs is packet loss rate: the num-
ber of lost packets divided by total number of arriving packets over
a given time interval. As identiﬁed in [35], the difﬁculty in esti-
mating the end-to-end loss rate is that it is unclear how to measure
demand along a path (i.e., the denominator used in calculating the
loss rate) particularly during congestion periods. Thus, we propose
a heuristic approach as outlined in an earlier workshop paper [36].
sists of three packets, sent back-to-back. We measure the loss rate
end-to-end frequency of congestion episodes bF and the mean du-
ration of congestion episodes bD. In this approach, each probe con-
bl of the probes during congestion episodes. Since the methodology
of [35] does not identify individual congestion episodes, we take an
empirical approach, treating consecutive probes in which at least
one packet is lost as indication of a congestion episode (i.e., similar
to [41]). We assume that the end-to-end loss rate L is stationary and
We start with the methodology in [35], which initiates a probe
pair at a given time slot with probability ploss for estimation of the
ergodic. Given an estimate of the frequency of congestion bF, we
estimate the end-to-end loss rate as bL = bFbl.
The key assumption of this heuristic is that we treat the probe
