# Analysis of Ghost Domain Names at Open DNS Resolvers

## 1. Introduction
This document analyzes the persistence and vulnerability of ghost domain names in open DNS resolvers. We explore how these domains are resolved over time and the factors that influence their longevity.

## 2. Time-Based Resolution of Ghost Domain Names
### 2.1. Time Series Data
- **Dates in August 2011:**
  - 03/08
  - 05/08
  - 07/08
  - 09/08

- **Figure 3a:**
  - **Description:** This figure shows the resolution of domain names at open DNS resolvers over time. The dashed vertical line indicates the original TTL (Time to Live) expiration time for [1-2].ghostdomain.info after they are removed from the domain registry.
  - **Observation:** The number of resolvers that can resolve a revoked legitimate domain name (1.ghostdomain.info) rapidly decreases after its TTL expires. In contrast, a ghost domain name (2.ghostdomain.info) can be resolved by most DNS resolvers even after its TTL has expired. More than 93% of DNS resolvers still reply with a positive response for resolving the ghost domain name after its TTL has expired, indicating that these resolvers are vulnerable to the ghost domain name attack. Even one week after TTL expiration, the ghost domain names are still resolvable by more than 70% of all DNS resolvers.

- **Figure 3b:**
  - **Description:** This figure provides a geographic view of all the haunted DNS resolvers one week after the TTL expiration.
  - **Observation:** The number of haunted DNS resolvers gradually declines over time, but a significant number remain vulnerable.

### 2.2. Post-TTL Expiration Behavior
- **Revoked Legitimate Domain Name:**
  - After TTL expiration, a revoked legitimate domain name can still be resolved by approximately 10% of DNS resolvers. This is due to extremely loose enforcement of cache update policies at certain resolvers, which accept all referral sections and overwrite cached entries without validation.

- **Ghost Domain Name:**
  - A ghost domain name can be resolved by most DNS resolvers even after its TTL has expired. This is because some resolvers do not strictly enforce cache update policies and can be haunted by a ghost domain name with periodic queries.

## 3. Cost of Maintaining Ghost Domain Names
### 3.1. Bandwidth Consumption
- **Main Cost:** The primary cost of maintaining a ghost domain name is network bandwidth consumption. An attacker needs to send numerous DNS queries to refresh the cached entries of a ghost domain name. The amount of effort required is proportional to the number of targeted resolvers.
- **Refreshing Interval:** The refreshing interval is determined by the TTL value of the delegation data for the ghost domain and the refreshing interval per TTL. To keep the cached data alive, at least one refreshing operation is needed before a cached entry expires.

### 3.2. Practical Considerations
- **TTL Limitations:** Most DNS resolvers enforce a maximum TTL limitation, typically around one day (16.35%) or one week (79.81%). This limits the effectiveness of using a very large TTL value.
- **Refreshing Frequency:** If an attacker ensures that one refreshment is sent for each quarter of TTL, additional refreshing efforts can increase the effectiveness, but not significantly. Refreshing more often is useful only to reduce the chance of packet losses.

## 4. Factors Affecting the Lifetime of Ghost Domains
### 4.1. Resolver Types
- **Stable Resolvers:**
  - The TTL value monotonically decreases to zero, then goes back to the original value.
- **Resolvers with Unreachable Periods:**
  - Unreachable periods create gaps in the middle of the line, during which ghost domains may fail to be renewed.
- **Proxies:**
  - Multiple cache servers in the backend cause multiple TTL lines. Ghost domains are easy to lose after churn of backend servers.
- **Resolvers that Occasionally Lose Cached Entries:**
  - This may be caused by cache replacement, cache flushing, or resolver resets. These factors can also cause the loss of ghost domains.

### 4.2. Experimental Observations
- **Resolver Types:**
  - Over 85% of resolvers that fail to keep ghost domains belong to the last two types, which are inherently easy to lose cached entries.
  - Less than 10% of failed resolvers come from the set of stable resolvers, which are less likely to lose cached entries, including ghost domains.
  - Over 65% of experimental resolvers are stable, suggesting that a ghost domain can stay alive for a long time. After one week, over 70% of experimental resolvers still keep the ghost domains we created.

## 5. Discussion
### 5.1. Defense Approaches
- **Basic Defense Strategy:**
  - Restrict the service range of the DNS resolver and routinely flush the DNS cache to purge possible ghost domains.
- **Fundamental Solutions:**
  - **Strengthen the Bailiwick Rule:** Tighten the bailiwick rule so that a recursive resolver only accepts a zoneâ€™s delegation data from the authoritative server of its parent zone.
  - **Refine the Credibility Rule:** Disallow cache overwriting when received records have the same trust level as cached data.
  - **Allow Updates with TTL Exceptions:** Allow cache updates with exceptions to the TTL value, preventing the ghost domain attack from preserving revoked domains.

### 5.2. Current Practices
- **DNSSEC:**
  - DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) avoids this problem implicitly through its strict delegation requirements.

## 6. Conclusion
The persistence of ghost domain names in open DNS resolvers is a significant security issue. By understanding the factors that influence their longevity and implementing effective defense strategies, we can mitigate the risks associated with ghost domain attacks.
