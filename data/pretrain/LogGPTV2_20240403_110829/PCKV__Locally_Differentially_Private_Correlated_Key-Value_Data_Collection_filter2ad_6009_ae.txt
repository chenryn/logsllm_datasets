Figure 6: MSEs of synthetic data under two distributions, where the
left is MSE of frequency estimation and the right is MSE of mean
estimation. The theoretical MSEs (dashed lines) of PCKV-UE and
PCKV-GRR are calculated by Theorem 4. When ε is small, the gap
between empirical and theoretical results is caused by the correction
in the improved estimation (Algorithm 4), while our theoretical MSE
is analyzed for the baseline estimation without correction.
Inﬂuence of Data Distribution. By comparing the results
of PCKV-UE and PCKV-GRR under different distributions in
Figure 6, MSE ˆmk of all keys in Gaussian distribution is larger
than in Uniform distribution because the frequency of some
keys is very small in Gaussian distribution. However, MSE ˆmk
of the top 20 frequent keys is much smaller because the fre-
quent keys have higher frequencies. Note that the distribution
in these mechanisms because
has little inﬂuence on MSE ˆfk
the user size used in frequency estimation is always n, while
the user size used in value mean estimation of k ∈ K is n f
∗
k .
Inﬂuence of Domain Size. The MSEs of frequency and
mean estimation with respect to different domain size d
(where ε = 1 or 5) are shown in Figure 7. We can observe
that MSE ˆfk
is proportional to the domain size d in PrivKVM,
KVUE, and PCKV-GRR. Note that the reasons for the same
observation are different. For PrivKVM and KVUE, the per-
turbation probabilities are independent of domain size, but
the large domain size would make sampling protocol (ran-
domly pick one index from the domain of keys) less possible
to obtain the useful information. For PCKV-GRR, the large
domain size does not inﬂuence the Padding-and-Sampling
protocol, but it will decrease the perturbation probabilities a
and b in (23) and enlarge the estimation error. However, the

large domain size does not affect the frequency estimation
of PCKV-UE. For the result of mean estimation, we have
similar observations. Note that MSE ˆmk is not proportional to
the domain size because the correction of mean estimation
can alleviate the error. For PCKV-UE, the increasing MSE ˆmk
when d < 100 is caused by the decreased true frequency when
d is increasing (note that σkey = 50 and samples outside the
domain are discarded when generating the data). The predic-
tion of PrivKVM (1r5v) with virtual iterations does not work
well for a large domain size under small ε.
Accuracy of Top Frequent Keys Selection. To evaluate
the success of the top frequent keys selection, we calculate
the precision (i.e., the proportion of correct selections over all
predicted top frequent keys) for different mechanisms, shown
in Figure 8 (precision in this case is the same as recall). For
the top 10 frequent keys under ε = 3, the precision of PCKV-
UE is over 60% even for a large d (i.e., misestimation is at
most 4 over the top 10 frequent keys). However, PrivKVM
and KVUE incorrectly select almost all top 10 frequent keys
when d = 2000. For the top 20 frequent keys under ε = 5,
PCKV-UE and PCKV-GRR can correctly estimate 95% and
85% respectively even for d = 2000.
Comparison of Allocation Methods. In our PCKV frame-
work, the privacy-utility tradeoff is improved by both the
tighter bound in budget composition (Theorem 2 and Theo-
rem 3) and the optimized budget allocation (Lemma 2 and
Lemma 3). In order to show the beneﬁt of our optimized allo-
cation, we compare the results of optimized method with two

alternative allocation ones in Figure 9, where the correspond-
ing theoretical comparison has been discussed in Sec. 5.4.
The naive allocation is ε1 = ε2 = ε/2, and the non-optimized
allocation with tighter bound is represented in (21), which also
works for PCKV-GRR when (cid:2) = 1. We can observe that for
both PCKV-UE and PCKV-GRR, the allocation methods with
tighter bound (non-optimized and optimized) outperform the
naive one in the estimation accuracy of mean and frequency.
Even though MSE ˆfk
in optimized allocation is slightly greater
than the non-optimized one, it has much less MSE ˆmk. Note
that the magnitude of MSE ˆfk
and MSE ˆmk are different. For ex-
ample, when ε = 1, the gap of MSE ˆfk
between non-optimized
and optimized allocation in PCKV-UE is 4×10−6, but the gap
of MSE ˆmk between them is 0.08. These observations validate
our theoretical analyses and discussions in Sec. 5.4.
6.2 Real-World Data
The results of four types of real-world rating datasets are
shown in Figure 10, where the MSEs are averaged over the
top 50 frequent keys. The parameters (number of ratings,
users, and keys) are listed in Table 1, where we select reason-
able (cid:2) for evaluation to compare with existing mechanisms
with naive sampling protocol (the advanced strategy of se-
lecting an optimized (cid:2) is discussed in Sec. 5.1). Under the
large domain size in real-world datasets, PrivKVM (1r5v)
with virtual iterations does not work well, thus we only show
the results of PrivKVM (c = 1). Compared with the results
of E-commerce dataset, the MSEs of Clothing dataset do not
change very much because all algorithms can get beneﬁts
from the large n, which compensates the impacts from the
larger d or the larger (cid:2). Compared with the results of PCKV-
UE in Clothing dataset, MSE ˆfk
in Amazon dataset is smaller
(due to the large n) but MSE ˆmk is larger (due to the small
true frequencies). In the ﬁrst three datasets, PCKV-UE has
the best performance because (cid:2) is small and the large domain
size does not impact its performance directly. In the Movie
dataset, since PCKV-GRR can beneﬁt more from a large (cid:2),
it outperforms PCKV-UE in both frequency and mean esti-
mation. Note that both PCKV-UE and PCKV-GRR have less
MSEs compared with other mechanisms in Movie dataset.
Since PCKV-UE and PCKV-GRR are suitable for different
cases, in practice we can select PCKV-UE or PCKV-GRR
by comparing the theoretical estimation error under speciﬁed
parameters (i.e., ε,d and (cid:2)) as discussed in Sec. 5.4.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, a new framework called PCKV (with two mech-
anisms PCKV-UE and PCKV-GRR) is proposed to privately
collect key-value data under LDP with higher accuracy of
frequency and value mean estimation. We design a correlated
key and value perturbation mechanism that leads to a tighter
budget composition than sequential composition of LDP. We
further improve the privacy-utility tradeoff via a near-optimal
budget allocation method. Besides the tight budget composi-
tion and optimized budget allocation, the proposed sampling
protocol and mean estimators in our framework also improve
the accuracy of estimation than existing protocols. Finally, we
demonstrate the advantage of the proposed scheme on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.
For future work, we will study how to choose an optimized
(cid:2) in the Padding-and-Sampling protocol and extend the corre-
lated perturbation and tight composition analysis to consider
more general forms of correlation and other hybrid data types.
