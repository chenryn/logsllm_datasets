Abstract. This paper examines the problem of characterizing and as-
sessing the global impact of the load imposed by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
overlay on the AS-level underlay. In particular, we capture Gnutella snap-
shots for four consecutive years, obtain the corresponding AS-level topol-
ogy snapshots of the Internet and infer the AS-paths associated with
each overlay connection. Assuming a simple model of overlay traﬃc, we
analyze the observed load imposed by these Gnutella snapshots on the
AS-level underlay using metrics that characterize the load seen on indi-
vidual AS-paths and by the transit ASes, illustrate the churn among the
top transit ASes during this 4-year period, and describe the propagation
of traﬃc within the AS-level hierarchy.
Keywords: Overlay networks, AS-level topology, BGP simulation.
1 Introduction
The large volume of traﬃc associated with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications has
led to a growing concern among ISPs which need to carry the P2P traﬃc relayed
by their costumers. This concern has led researchers and practitioners to focus
on the idea of reducing the volume of external P2P traﬃc for edge ISPs by local-
izing the connectivity of the P2P overlay (for recent work, see for example [1,2]).
However, such an approach only deals with the local eﬀect of an overlay on in-
dividual edge ASes. Even though the volume of P2P traﬃc on the Internet is
large and growing, assessing the global impact of a P2P overlay on the individual
ASes in the network, which we call the AS-level underlay, remains a challenging
problem and is not well understood. This is in part due to the fact that investi-
gating this problem requires a solid understanding of an array of issues in two
diﬀerent domains: (i) design and characterization of overlay-based applications,
and (ii) characterization of AS-level underlay topology and BGP routing in this
underlay. Another signiﬁcant challenge is dealing with inaccurate, missing, or
ambiguous information about the AS-level underlay topology, AS relationships
and tier properties, and BGP routing policies.
This paper investigates the problem of assessing the load imposed by a given
overlay on the AS-level underlay. We show that assessing this impact requires

tackling a number of challenging problems, including (i) capturing accurate snap-
shots of the desired overlay, (ii) estimating the load associated with individual
overlay connections, and (iii) determining the AS-path in the underlay that cor-
responds to individual overlay connections. Toward this end, this paper makes
two main contributions. First, we present a methodology for assessing the im-
pact of an overlay on the AS-level underlay. Our methodology incorporates a
collection of the best known practices for capturing accurate snapshots of a P2P
overlay and, more importantly, for determining the AS-path corresponding to
each overlay connection. We rely on snapshots of the AS-level Internet topol-
ogy provided by CAIDA where each link between two ASes is annotated with
the relationship between them. Using a BGP simulator called C-BGP [4], we
perform a detailed simulation of BGP routing over these annotated snapshots
of the AS-level underlay to infer the corresponding AS-path for each overlay
connection and determine the aggregate load crossing individual ASes. To assess
the propagation of overlay traﬃc through the AS-level hierarchy, we also infer
the tier information for individual ASes using the TierClassify tool [3].
Second, we illustrate our methodology by characterizing the impact of four
snapshots of the Gnutella overlay that were captured over four successive years
on the AS-level underlay snapshots of the Internet taken on the same dates the
Gnutella overlay snapshots were obtained. We characterize the load imposed
by these overlays on the corresponding underlay in a number of diﬀerent ways:
(i) observed load on individual AS-paths and its diversity, (ii) observed load on
individual transit ASes, (iii) AS-path length, and (iv) the propagation of overlay
traﬃc through the AS-level hierarchy. Our analysis provides valuable insight into
how changes in overlay connectivity and underlay topology aﬀect the mapping
of load on the AS-level underlay.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we further elab-
orate on the problem of mapping an overlay on the AS-level underlay, describe
the challenges involved, and present our methodology. Section 3 describes our
datasets and presents our characterization of the load imposed by the Gnutella
overlay on the corresponding AS-level underlay, spanning a 4-year period. We
conclude the paper and sketch our future plans in Section 4.
2 The Problem and Our Methodology
Our goal is to map the traﬃc associated with a P2P overlay to the AS-level
underlay. The input to this process is a representation of a P2P overlay structure
consisting of the IP addresses (and port numbers) of the participating peers
together with their neighbor lists. The output is the aggregate load on all aﬀected
ASes and between each pair of aﬀected ASes that have a peering link with one
another (in each direction). Our methodology to tackle this problem consists of
the following intuitive steps:
1. Capturing the topology of a P2P overlay,
2. Estimating the load on individual connections in the overlay,
3. Inferring the AS-paths associated with individual overlay connections,

4. Determining the aggregate load on each AS and between connected ASes (in
each direction separately).
In this section, we discuss the challenges posed by each step, clarify our assump-
tions, and describe our approach for each step.
2.1 Capturing the Overlay Topology
Capturing a snapshot of the overlay topology for a P2P application is feasible
if the list of neighbors for individual peers can be obtained. For example, in
Gnutella it is possible to query individual peers and retrieve their neighbor lists.
Therefore, a Gnutella-speciﬁc crawler can be developed to progressively collect
this information until a complete snapshot of the overlay is captured.
In our earlier work, we have developed a fast P2P crawler that can capture
accurate snapshots of the Gnutella network in a few minutes [5]. Using this
crawler, we have captured tens of thousands of snapshots of the Gnutella over-
lay topology over the past several years. In this study, we use a few of these
snapshots for the top-level overlay of Gnutella (an overlay consisting of Gnutella
Ultrapeers). While other P2P applications such as BitTorrent are responsible for
a signiﬁcantly larger volume of traﬃc over the Internet than Gnutella and would
therefore provide a more relevant P2P system for this study, we are not aware of
any reliable technique to capture accurate snapshots of the corresponding over-
lays. Since accuracy of the overlay topology is important in this study, we focus
on Gnutella. However, our methodology is not restricted to this application and
can be used with other P2P systems.
2.2 Estimating the Load of Individual Overlay Connections
The load of individual overlay connections depends on the subtle interactions be-
tween several factors including: (i) the number of peers that generate traﬃc (i.e.,
sources), the rate and pattern of traﬃc generation by these peers, and their relative
location in the overlay, (ii) the topology of the overlay, and (iii) the relaying (i.e.,
routing) strategy at individual peers. Capturing these factors in a single model is
a non-trivial task and could be application-speciﬁc. For example, the load of indi-
vidual connections for live P2P video streaming is more or less constant, whereas
the load of individual BitTorrent connections may vary signiﬁcantly over time.
In the absence of any reliable model for per-connection traﬃc, without loss
of generality, we assume in our analysis that all connections of the overlay ex-
perience the same average load in both directions. This simplifying assumption
allows us to focus on the mapping of the overlay topology on the underlying
AS-level topology. If a more reliable model for the load of individual connections
is available, it can be easily plugged into our methodology by assigning proper
weights (one in each direction) to each connection of the overlay. In this paper,
we simply assume that the weight for all connections in both directions is one.
2.3 Inferring AS-Paths for Individual Overlay Connections
For each connection in the overlay, determining the corresponding AS-path in
the underlay is clearly the most important and most challenging part of our
4

methodology. We use a popular BGP simulator to determine the AS-path be-
tween any given pair of ASes, but note that carefully-designed measurement-
based approaches may provide viable alternatives. Our simulation-based method
consists of the following steps:
Mapping Peers to ASes: We use archived BGP snapshots from RouteViews [6]
to map the IP addresses of individual peers to their corresponding ASes that we
call edge ASes. Therefore, determining the AS-path for the overlay connection be-
tween two peers translates into determining the path between their corresponding
edge ASes.
Capturing AS-level Topology and Inter-AS Relationships: In this study,
we rely on the AS-level topologies provided by CAIDA [7]. These topologies have
been widely used in the past, even though more recent work has shown that the
provided topologies are missing a signiﬁcant portion of peering links between lower-
tiered ASes [8,9]. Note that our approach is not tied to using the CAIDA-provided
AS-level topologies, and any more complete AS-level topology can be incorpo-
rated once it becomes available. To properly simulate BGP routing, we need to
determine the AS relationship between connected ASes in the AS-level topology.
Toward this end, we use the fact that CAIDA’s snapshots of the AS-level topol-
ogy [7] are annotated with the inferred relationships between each pair of con-
nected ASes. In these snapshots, AS relationships are inferred using the algorithm
initially proposed by Gao [10] and extended by Dimitropoulos et al. [11]. This al-
gorithm, mainly based on the concept of “valley-free routing” in BGP (along with
some other intuitive assumptions), categorizes the AS relationships into three cat-
egories: (i) Customer-Provider, (ii) Peer-Peer, or (iii) Sibling-Sibling.
Simulating BGP: We determine the AS-path between any pair of edge ASes that
host connected peers in the overlay (i.e., infer the corresponding AS-path) by sim-
ulating BGP over the annotated AS-level topology using the C-BGP simulator [4].
C-BGP abstracts the AS-level topology as a collection of interconnected routers,
where each router represents an AS. It simulates the desired BGP routing policies
for each relation between connected ASes. We use a set of intuitive BGP policies for
each type of AS relationships that are speciﬁed by C-BGP. In particular, these poli-
cies (i) ensure that the routes through one’s customers have the highest preference
and those passing through its providers have the lowest preference, and (ii) prevent
ASes with multiple providers from acting as transit node among their providers.
We noticed that some characteristics of CAIDA’s annotated AS-level topology, in
particular the presence of circular provider-costumer relationships among a group
of ASes, prevent our C-BGP simulations to converge with the above policies. To
resolve these problems, we systematically change a small number of relationships
(e.g., to break a cycle in customer-provider relationships). Further details of this
process are described in our related technical report [12]. We select snapshots of
both the AS-level topology and the overlay topology of the same dates so as to
minimize any potential error due to asynchrony in the snapshots.

Clearly, representing each AS by a single router results in inferring only one
AS-path between each pair of ASes. This implies that multiple AS-paths that
may exist in practice between two ASes [13] are not accounted for in our simu-
lations. While this assumption simpliﬁes the problem in a way that is not easily
quantiﬁable, we are not aware of any existing technique that can reliably capture
and account for this subtle behavior of BGP routing.
Assessing AS Tiers: To characterize the propagation of P2P traﬃc through
the AS-level hierarchy, we ﬁrst need to assess the location of each AS in this
hierarchy. We use the “TierClassify” tool [3] to identify the tier of each individual
AS. The algorithm used in this tool relies mainly on the assumption that all tier-
1 ASes should be interconnected with one another. Therefore it tries to ﬁnd a
clique among the ASes with highest degrees. Once the tier-1 clique is identiﬁed,
the algorithm simply follows provider-customer relationships and classiﬁes other
ASes such that each tier n AS can reach the tier-1 clique in n − 1 hops.
2.4 Determining Aggregate Load on and between Individual ASes
Given the corresponding AS-path for each overlay connection, we can easily
determine the aggregate load (in terms of the number of connections) that passes
through each AS, as well as the transit load (in each direction) between each
pair of connected ASes in the topology.
3 Eﬀect of Overlays on the Underlay
In this section, we characterize the eﬀect of a P2P overlay on the AS-level un-
derlay using four snapshots of the Gnutella top-level overlay. We broadly divide
ASes into two groups: Edge ASes that host peers in an overlay, and Transit (or
Core) ASes that provide connectivity between edge ASes. We ﬁrst describe our
datasets (i.e., the snapshots of overlay and the corresponding AS-level underlay
topologies), and then we characterize the imposed load on the underlay using the
following measures: (i) diversity and load on individual AS-paths, (ii) load on
individual transit ASes, (iii) identity and evolution of the top transit ASes, (iv)
AS-path length, and (v) propagation of traﬃc through the AS-level hierarchy.
Datasets: We use four snapshots of the top-level Gnutella overlay that were
collected in four consecutive years starting in 2004. Examining overlay snapshots
over time enables us to assess some trends that are associated with the evolution
of the AS-level topology.
We use the labels G-xx to refer to the snapshot taken in year 20xx. The
left columns of Table 1 (labeled “Gnutella snapshots”) summarize the capture
date, number of peers and edges for these overlay snapshots. The table shows
that the population of Gnutella peers in the top-level overlay and their pairwise
connections have both increased by ≈ 600% during this four-year period.
We also use daily snapshots of the BGP routing table retrieved from the Route-
Views archive collected at the same dates as our overlay snapshots. The middle

columns in Table 1 (labeled “BGP snapshots”) give the number of IP preﬁxes and
the total number of ASes in each BGP snapshot. These numbers show that the
AS-level topology has also grown signiﬁcantly during this four-year period.
Diversity and Load on Individual AS-Paths: One way to characterize the
impact of an overlay on the underlay is to determine the number of unique AS-
paths that all overlay connections are mapped on as well as distribution of load
among those AS-paths. The right columns of Table 1 (labeled “AS-paths”) show
the number of unique AS-paths for all connections of each overlay along with
the percentage of those paths that carry more than 100 overlay connections. The
number of unique AS-paths is growing over time but at a lower pace compared
to the number of overlay connections. This suggests that there is more similarity
in AS-paths among overlay connections as the overlay grows in size over time.
To examine the mapping of overlay connections to AS-paths more closely,
Figure 1(a) depicts the CCDF of the number of overlay connections that map to
individual AS-paths in log-log scale for all four overlay snapshots. The skewed
shape of these distributions indicates that a small number of AS-paths carry a
large fraction of load. For example, whereas around 10% of paths carry more
than 10 connections, only 1% of the paths carry more than 200 connections.
Interestingly, the distributions of overlay connections that map to AS-paths are
very similar across diﬀerent snapshots despite signiﬁcant changes in the identity
of peers and in the topologies of overlay and underlay.
Observed Load on Individual Transit ASes: Since we assumed that all
overlay connections have the same load, we simply quantify the load on each
transit AS by the number of overlay connections crossing that AS. Figure 1(b)
depicts the number of overlay connections that cross each transit AS in log-log
scale, where ASes are ranked (from high to low) based on their overall observed
load. The ﬁgure shows that the load on transit ASes is very skewed. A small
number of them carry a large volume of traﬃc while the load on most transit
ASes is rather small. Again, we observe that the overall shape of the resulting
curves is very similar for all four snapshots, except for the outward shift in the
more recent snapshots caused by the increasing size of the overlay over time. This
similarity in the skewness of the observed load on transit ASes despite signiﬁcant
changes in the overlay and underlay topologies over time could be due to the
dominance of one the following factors: (i) the stability over time of the top-10
