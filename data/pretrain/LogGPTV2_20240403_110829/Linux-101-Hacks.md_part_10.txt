## Hack 98: Netstat Command
The `netstat` command displays network-related information such as network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. Here are some examples of how to use the `netstat` command:

### Display Active Internet Connections and Domain Sockets
```sh
# netstat -an
```
**Output:**
```
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5666            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:111             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4086            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
...
Active UNIX domain sockets (servers and established)
Proto RefCnt Flags Type       State I-Node Path
unix  2      [ ACC ] STREAM    LISTENING 7894  /tmp/.font-unix/fs7100
unix  2      [ ACC ] STREAM    LISTENING 9662  /tmp/.gdm_socket
unix  2      [ ACC ] STREAM    LISTENING 10897 @/tmp/fam-root-128
```

### Display Active Connections with Process ID and Program Name
This can be very helpful to identify which program has initiated a specific network connection.
```sh
# netstat -tap
```
**Output:**
```
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 *:nrpe                   *:*                     LISTEN      16277/xinetd
tcp        0      0 localhost.localdomain:smtp *:*                    LISTEN      7263/sendmail: acce
tcp        34     0 localhost.localdomain:54221 localhost.localdomain:4089 CLOSE_WAIT 29881/httpd
tcp        0      3216 dev-db:ssh             cpe-76-94-215-154.soca:4682 ESTABLISHED 11717/sshd: ramesh
```

### Display Routing Table
```sh
# netstat --route
```
**Output:**
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window irtt Iface
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U       0   0       0   eth0
162.244.0.0     *               255.255.0.0     U       0   0       0   eth0
default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG      0   0       0   eth0
```

### Display RAW Network Statistics
```sh
# netstat --statistics --raw
```
**Output:**
```
Ip:
129
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
11080343 total packets received
0 forwarded
1 with unknown protocol
0 incoming packets discarded
11037744 incoming packets delivered
11199763 requests sent out
Icmp:
577135 ICMP messages received
64 input ICMP message failed.
ICMP input histogram:
destination unreachable: 537
timeout in transit: 65
source quenches: 2
echo requests: 576476
echo replies: 12
timestamp request: 3
address mask request: 3
581558 ICMP messages sent
0 ICMP messages failed
ICMP output histogram:
destination unreachable: 5079
echo replies: 576476
timestamp replies: 3
```

### Miscellaneous Netstat Commands
- **List of TCP connections to and from the machine:**
  ```sh
  # netstat --tcp --numeric
  ```
- **Display TCP ports that the server is listening on along with the program:**
  ```sh
  # netstat --tcp --listening --programs
  ```
- **Display the routing cache:**
  ```sh
  # netstat -rnC
  ```

## Hack 99: Sysctl Command
The `sysctl` command allows you to change Linux kernel parameters on the fly. It helps configure Linux kernel parameters during runtime.

### Display All Kernel Parameters
```sh
# sysctl -a
```
**Output:**
```
dev.cdrom.autoclose = 1
fs.quota.writes = 0
kernel.ctrl-alt-del = 0
kernel.domainname = (none)
kernel.exec-shield = 1
net.core.somaxconn = 128
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 131072
net.ipv6.route.mtu_expires = 600
sunrpc.udp_slot_table_entries = 16
vm.block_dump = 0
```

### Modify Kernel Parameter for Permanent Change
After modifying the kernel parameter in `/etc/sysctl.conf`, execute `sysctl -p` to commit the changes. The changes will persist after a reboot.
```sh
# vi /etc/sysctl.conf
# sysctl -p
```

### Modify Kernel Parameter Temporarily
To temporarily modify a kernel parameter, execute the following command. Note that these changes will be lost after a reboot.
```sh
# sysctl -w {variable-name=value}
```

## Hack 100: Nice Command
The kernel decides the amount of processor time required for a process based on the nice value. The possible range for nice values is -20 to 20. A process with a nice value of -20 is very high priority, while a process with a nice value of 20 is very low priority.

### Display Nice Value of All Running Processes
```sh
# ps axl
```
**Output:**
```
F UID   PID  PPID  PRI  NI  VSZ  RSS  WCHAN  STAT TTY          TIME COMMAND
4  0     1   0     16   0  2172  552  -      S    ?            0:17 init [5]
1  0     3   1     34   19 0    0    ksofti  SN   ?            3:18 [ksoftirqd/0]
1  0    10   1     5   -10  0    0    worker  S<  ?            0:01 [events/0]
4  0  5145  1     25   10  32124 18592 -      SNs  ?            0:08 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/rhn-applet-gui --sm-client-id default4
4  0  5147  5142  16   0   3528  604  -      S    ?            0:00 /sbin/pam_timestamp_check -d root
1  503 17552 4180  16   0   14208 3920  -      S    ?            0:01 /home/www/apache2/bin/httpd -f /home/www/apache2/conf/httpd.conf -k start
```

### Assign a Low Priority to a Shell Script (Higher Nice Value)
In the example below, when the `nice-test.sh` script is started in the background, it takes the nice value of 0.
```sh
$ ./nice-test.sh &
[3] 13009
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0  509  13009 12863 17  0   4652  972  wait   S    pts/1        0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
```
Now, let's execute the same shell script with a different nice value.
```sh
$ nice -10 ./nice-test.sh &
[1] 13016
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0  509  13016 12863 30  10  4236  968  wait   SN   pts/1        0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
```

### Assign a High Priority to a Shell Script (Lower Nice Value)
In the following example, let's assign a nice value of -10 (minus 10) to the `nice-test.sh` shell script.
```sh
$ nice --10 ./nice-test.sh &
[1] 13021
$ nice: cannot set priority: Permission denied
```
Note: Only the root user can set a negative nice value. Log in as root and try again.
```sh
# nice --10 ./nice-test.sh &
[1] 13060
# ps axl | grep nice-test
4  0    13060 13024 10  -10  5388  964  wait   S<  pts/1        0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
```

## Hack 101: Renice Command
The `renice` command alters the scheduling priority of a running process.

### Decrease the Priority of a Running Process (Increase Nice Value)
In the example below, an existing shell script is running at a nice value of 10.
```sh
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0  509  13245 13216 30  10  5244  968  wait   SN  pts/1        0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
```
To increase the nice value (thus reducing the priority), execute the `renice` command.
```sh
$ renice 16 -p 13245
13245: old priority 10, new priority 16
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0  509  13245 13216 36  16  5244  968  wait   SN  pts/1        0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
```

### Increase the Priority of a Running Process (Decrease Nice Value)
In the example below, an existing shell script is running at a nice value of 10.
```sh
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0  509  13254 13216 30  10  4412  968  wait   SN  pts/1        0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
```
To increase the priority, give a lower nice value. However, only the root user can increase the priority of a running process.
```sh
$ renice 5 -p 13254
renice: 13254: setpriority: Permission denied
```
Log in as root to increase the priority of a running process.
```sh
# su -
# renice 5 -p 13254
13254: old priority 10, new priority 5
# ps axl | grep nice-test
0  509  13254 13216 25  5   4412  968  wait   SN  pts/1        0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
```
