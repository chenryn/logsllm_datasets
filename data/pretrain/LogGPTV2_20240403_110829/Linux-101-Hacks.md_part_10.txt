Hack 99. Sysctl Command
Linux kernel parameter can be changed on the fly using sysctl command.
130
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
Sysctl helps to configure the Linux kernel parameters during runtime.
# sysctl –a
dev.cdrom.autoclose = 1
fs.quota.writes = 0
kernel.ctrl-alt-del = 0
kernel.domainname = (none)
kernel.exec-shield = 1
net.core.somaxconn = 128
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 131072
net.ipv6.route.mtu_expires = 600
sunrpc.udp_slot_table_entries = 16
vm.block_dump = 0
Modify Kernel parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf for permanent change
After modifying the kernel parameter in the /etc/sysctl.conf, execute sysctl –
p to commit the changes. The changes will still be there after the reboot.
# vi /etc/sysctl.conf
# sysctl –p
Modify kernel parameter temporarily
To temporarily modify a kernel parameter, execute the following command.
Please note that after reboot these changes will be lost.
# sysctl –w {variable-name=value}

Hack 100. Nice Command
Kernel decides how much processor time is required for a process based on
the nice value. Possible nice value range is: -20 to 20. A process that has a
nice value of -20 is very high priority. The process that has a nice value of 20
is very low priority.
Use ps axl to display the nice value of all running process as shown below.
# ps axl
F UID PID PPID PRI NI VSZ RSS WCHAN STAT TTY

How to assign a low priority to a shell-script? (higher nice value)
In the example below, when I started the nice-test.sh script in the
background, it took the nice value of 0.
$ ./nice-test.sh &
[3] 13009
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0 509 13009 12863 17 0 4652 972 wait S
132
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
pts/1 0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
[Note: 6th column with value 0 is the nice.]
Now, let us execute the same shell script with a different nice value as shown
below.
$ nice -10 ./nice-test.sh &
[1] 13016
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0 509 13016 12863 30 10 4236 968 wait SN
pts/1 0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
[Note: 6th column with value 10 is the nice value for
the shell-script.]
How to assign a high priority to a shell-script? (Lower nice value)
In the following example, let us assign a nice value of -10 (minus 10) to the
nice-test.sh shellscript.
$ nice --10 ./nice-test.sh &
[1] 13021
$ nice: cannot set priority: Permission denied
Note: Only root user can set a negative nice value. Login as root and try the
same. Please note that there is a double dash before the 10 in the nice
command below.
# nice --10 ./nice-test.sh &
[1] 13060
# ps axl | grep nice-test
4 0 13060 13024 10 -10 5388 964 wait S<
pts/1 0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
133
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
[Note: 6th column with value -10 is the nice value of
the shell-script.]
Hack 101. Renice Command
Renice alters the scheduling priority of a running process.
How to decrease the priority of a running process? (Increase nice)
In the example below, an existing shell-script is running at nice value of 10.
(6th column in the ps output)
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0 509 13245 13216 30 10 5244 968 wait SN
pts/1 0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
To increase the nice value (thus reducing the priority), execute the renice
command as shown below.
$ renice 16 -p 13245
13245: old priority 10, new priority 16
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0 509 13245 13216 36 16 5244 968 wait SN
pts/1 0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
[Note: Now, the 6th column of the nice-test.sh (PID
13245) shows the new nice value of 16.]
How to increase the priority of a running process? (Decrease nice)
In the example below, an existing shell-script is running at a nice value of 10.
134
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
(6th column in the ps output)
$ ps axl | grep nice-test
0 509 13254 13216 30 10 4412 968 wait SN
pts/1 0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
In increase the priority, give a lower nice value as shown below. However,
only root can increase the priority of a running process, else you’ll get the
following error message.
$ renice 5 -p 13254
renice: 13254: setpriority: Permission denied
Login as root to increase the priority of a running
process
$ su -
# renice 5 -p 13254
13254: old priority 10, new priority 5
# ps axl | grep nice-test
0 509 13254 13216 25 5 4412 968 wait SN
pts/1 0:00 /bin/bash ./nice-test.sh
[Note: The 6th column now shows a lower nice value of 5
(increased priority)]

12 Amazing and Essential Linux Books
For further reading on Linux, I recommend the following books. The 12 Linux
books mentioned here by no means are comprehensive or authoritative list.
But, these 12 Books are few of my favorites that I enjoyed reading over the
years and I strongly believe will enhance your technical abilities on Linux, if
you have not read them yet.
1. Sed and Awk, by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins. Sed and Awk
have transformed the way I worked on Linux command line. This book
is the only material you would ever need on Sed and Awk. Once
you’ve mastered even the basics of Sed and Awk, you’ll be amazed
with the amount of complex tasks you can perform very quickly and
elegently. For my day-to-day quick reference of sed and awk
examples, I use the Sed and Awk Pocket Reference, written by the
same author.
2. Learning the Vi and Vim Editors, by Arnold Robbins. I’m a
command-line junkie. So, naturally I’m a huge fan of Vi and Vim
editors. Several years back, when I wrote lot of C code on Linux, I
used to carry the Vi editor pocket reference with me all the times.
Even if you’ve been using Vi and Vim Editors for several years and
have not read this book, please do yourself a favor and read this
book. You’ll be amazed with the capabilities of Vim editor.
3. Bash Cookbook, by Carl Albing, JP Vossen and Cameron Newham.
Whether you are a sysadmin, DBA or a developer, you have to write
shell script at some point. A wise sysadmin knows that once you’ve
mastered the shell-scripting techniques, you can put your servers on
auto-pilot mode by letting the shell-scripts do the grunt work. To get
to the auto-pilot mode of sysadmin, you definitely need to master the
examples provided in this cookbook. There are quiet few Bash shell
books out there. But, this books tops them all by giving lot of detailed
examples.
4. SSH, The Secure Shell, by Daniel J. Barrett, Richard E. Silverman
and Robert G. Byrnes. This is hands-down the best book on SSH. This
book explains both theoretical and practical aspects of SSH. Using
136
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
SSH as an end-user is fairly straight forward . But, configuring SSH as
an administrator is complex and involves a detailed understanding of
SSH. This is a must read for any system administrator. The examples
in this book show exactly what needs to be done differently for the
different flavors of SSH such as SSH1, SSH2 and OpenSSH.
5. Essential System Administration, by Æleen Frisch. This is an
excellent book for those who like to become a Unix System
Administrator. This book covers all the typical system administration
tasks. This is a perfect companion when you are dealing with multiple
flavors of Unix, as it has examples for AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, Linux,
Solaris and Tru64. I’ve used the pocket version of this book —
Essential System Administration Pocket Reference, when I was
managing multiple flavors of Unix systems at the same time.
6. Linux Server Hacks, Volume One, by Rob Flickenger. 100 awesome
practical hacks packed in one book. Setup a Linux test bed and try
out all these hacks. These hacks are neatly grouped into different
sections — Server Basics, Revision Control, Backups, Networking,
Monitoring, SSH, Scripting, and Information Servers. Once you’ve
mastered these hacks, you should absolutely read Linux Server Hacks,
Volume Two, by William von Hagen and Brian Jones, which has 100
Linux hacks focussed on authentication, monitoring, security,
performance and connectivity.
7. DNS and BIND, by Cricket Liu and Paul Albitz. Several years ago, I
configured my first DNS by reading online documentation. I brought
this book to understand how DNS and BIND works. I’ve already
upgraded this book twice when a newer edition was released. This
should definitely be in your library, if you are a serious system
administrator.
8. Understanding the Linux Kernel, by Daniel Bovet and Marco Cesati.
If you are a serious developer on Linux environment or a sysadmin,
this is a must read. This books explains the inner workings of the
Linux Kernel 2.6 in a structured and logical way. This talks about how
Kenel handles the Memory Management, Process scheduling, I/O
architecture and Block devices. Overall this book is a treat for geeks
who are curious to explore what is under the hood of Linux.
9. Linux Cookbook, by Carla Schroder. This book covers Linux features
from both users and system administrators point of view. There are
137
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
two chapters dedicated for installing and managing software on RPM-
based system and Debian. If you use RedHat, the Linux Pocket Guide,
by Daniel J. Barrett is an excellent addition to your library, which
covers all the essential Linux command with a sample usage.
10. Linux Firewalls, by Michael Rash. To build a secure Linux system,
you must read this book. There are quiet few books out there for
iptables. But, this one talks specifically about the fundamentals of
how to configure an Intrusion Detection System using iptables, psad
and fwsnort. If you want a comprehensive handy reference of all the
things iptables can do with specific examples, Linux Iptables Pocket
Reference, by Gregor N. Purdy is the best.
11. Linux Administration Handbook, by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder and
Trent R. Hein. During my early days of system administration, I’ve
referred this book frequently. This is pretty detailed book with close
to 1000 pages and 30 chapters that are nicely grouped together in
three high level sections — Basic Administration, Networking and
Bunch O’ Stuff.
12. Beginning Ubuntu Linux, by Keir Thomas and Jaime Sicam. For
those who like to transition from Windows to Linux, install Ubuntu
Linux on one of your old laptop or desktop and get this book. I
strongly believe in spreading the news about Linux to those who don’t
use it. If you want any of your loved ones or friends to learn Linux,
install Ubuntu on an old laptop and give this book as a gift to them.
They’ll definitely be very thankful to you.
