After struggling to install the latest version of PostgreSQL and psycopg2, I decided to perform a complete reinstallation of Leopard. For the past year, I have been using MacPython 2.5, but I am now considering switching to MacPorts, even for version 2.6. My top priority is to ensure that Twisted, PIL, and psycopg2 function without any issues.

Could anyone provide some guidelines on which version to choose, based on their experience?

**Update:**

I have decided against reinstalling the operating system. Instead, I managed to clean up the problematic PostgresPlus installation and installed a new one. The official Python 2.6.1 package works perfectly, and I was able to install it alongside 2.5.2 without any problems. Psycopg2 also works as expected. However, as anticipated, PIL does not compile.

I will likely switch between MacPorts' 2.5 and the official 2.6 versions for different tasks, given that I am aware of the compatibility issues with some packages in MacPorts' Python.

**Second Update:**

I have successfully compiled PIL by hiding the entire MacPorts directory and half of the Xcode libraries, so it would find the correct ones. It did not accept the paths I provided, which is a known issue with PIL on Leopard.

**Recommendation:**

I would suggest sticking with MacPython version 2.5.x (currently 2.5.4). Here are my reasons:

- **Future Consistency:** Snow Leopard may still be on the 2.5 series, so it makes sense to stay consistent with the future OS. There's no point in jumping ahead too far.
- **Production Readiness:** Most production applications are unlikely to adopt 2.6 for at least another year.
- **Framework Support:** No frameworks or programs are expected to leave 2.5 behind for at least two years.

In summary, unless you are experimenting for fun, there is little practical reason to move to 2.6. If you are looking to experiment, you might as well go for Python 3.0.
