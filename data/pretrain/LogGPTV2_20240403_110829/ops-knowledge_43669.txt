User: After going through hell trying to install the latest version of postgresql and psycopg2 today I'm going for a complete reinstall of Leopard.
I've been sticking with macpython 2.5 for the past year but now I'm considering macports even 2.6
For me it's most important for Twisted, PIL and psycopg2 to be working without a problem.
Can anyone give some guidelines for what version I should choose, based on experience? 
Edit:
Ok I've decided to go without reinstalling the os. Hacked around to clean up the bad PostgresPlus installation and installed another one. The official python 2.6.1 package works great, no problem installing it alongside 2.5.2. Psycopg2 works. But as expected PIL wont compile. 
I guess I'll be switching between the 2.5 from macports and the official 2.6 for different tasks, since I know the macports python has it's issues with some packages.
Another Edit:
I've now compiled PIL. Had to hide the whole macports directory and half the xcode libraries, so it would find the right ones. It wouldn't accept the paths I was feeding it. PIL is notorious for this on leopard.
Assistant: I would stick with the MacPython version 2.5.x (I believe 2.5.4 currently).  Here's my rationale:

Snow Leopard may still be on the 2.5 series, so you might as well be consistent with the future OS (i.e. no point in going too far ahead).
For most production apps, nobody is going to want to use 2.6 for another year.
No frameworks/programs are going to leave 2.5 behind for at least 2 years.

In other words, my approach is that the only reason to do 2.6 is for fun.  If you're looking to have fun, just go for 3.0.
