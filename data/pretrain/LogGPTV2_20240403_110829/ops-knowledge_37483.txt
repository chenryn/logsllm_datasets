Question: "A web application has implemented JWT for authentication and the tokens are transmitted over HTTPS. The developers have ensured that the JWT payload does not contain sensitive information. However, they are storing the JWTs in local storage on the client-side. Which of the following statements present a valid security concern?"
 "A": "Storing JWTs in local storage is secure since the payload does not contain sensitive information and the tokens are transmitted over HTTPS."
 "B": "Storing JWTs in local storage is insecure because it is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks which could lead to token theft."
 "C": "JWTs should never be stored on the client-side, regardless of the transmission security or payload content, due to compliance with GDPR."
 "D": "Client-side storage of JWTs is recommended as it offloads the server from managing session state, enhancing the application's scalability."
Answer: B
