### System Information
- **OpenCV Version**: OpenCV for Android 3.1
- **Operating System/Platform**: Windows 7 or Windows 10
- **Development Environment**: Android Studio

### Detailed Description
I am unsure whether the issue I am encountering is a bug or simply an unsupported feature. I am attempting to run the second OpenCV Android sample, which can be found at the following link:
- [Sample Code](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/android/tutorial-2-mixedprocessing)

The original sample was developed using Eclipse, but I am trying to integrate it into Android Studio. I have encountered some difficulties and have documented them in a Stack Overflow post:
- [Stack Overflow Post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38416566/android-studio-opencv-c-jni-ndk-unable-to-configure)

Could you please advise if this integration is recommended or supported? Additionally, has anyone within the OpenCV organization successfully run the native C++ Android samples in Android Studio? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
