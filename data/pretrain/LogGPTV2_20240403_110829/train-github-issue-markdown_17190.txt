##### Detailed description
I'm not sure if this is a bug or simply not supported, but I'm trying to get
the 2nd OpenCV Android sample:
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/android/tutorial-2-mixedprocessing
working within Android Studio, rather than Eclipse which it seems to have been
done in originally. I made a Stack Overflow post that explains where I'm stuck
currently:

unable-to-configure
Is this something that is recommended or supported? Has anybody within the
OpenCV organization gotten the native C++ Android samples running within
Android Studio? Please advise
