### Forwarding and Inconsistency in BGP Path

The traffic is forwarded to AS 2, where it is matched to the BGP path for 1.1.1/24 at AS 2, and then forwarded to the attacker. This phenomenon arises from an inconsistency between AS 3’s perceived path to IP addresses in 1.1/16 (in the control plane) and AS 2’s actual forwarding path to IP addresses in 1.1.1/24 (in the data plane).

### Security Evaluation

Next, we quantify the impact of collateral benefit and damage on global routing security through extensive simulations using empirically-derived datasets.

#### Simulation Framework

Our simulations employ the BGP route-computation method described in [23], [24], and [26] and apply it to the CAIDA AS-connectivity graph from July 2016. The results are averaged over 10^6 combinations of attacker and victim ASes, both selected uniformly at random from the set of all ASes, as in [23] and [26]. The top ISPs (i.e., those with the highest number of customer ASes) enforce ROV, while all other ASes do not. The results presented are averaged values after repeating the experiment 20 times for each possible number of adopters \( x \in \{0, 10, ..., 100\} \).

#### Results

- **High Adoption Rate**: When the top 100 ISPs enforce ROV, hijack success rates drop significantly. Specifically, the success rate of prefix hijacks is below 10% when the 50 largest ISPs enforce ROV and below 5% when the 100 largest ISPs enforce ROV (see Figure 7a). For subprefix hijack attacks, the success rate falls from almost complete success to about 22% when the 100 top ISPs enforce ROV (see Figure 7b).
- **Low Adoption Rate**: When adoption is low, the attacker's success rates diminish much more slowly. For example, the subprefix hijacker’s success rate remains as high as 90% even when 25% of the top 400 ISPs perform ROV (i.e., for \( x = 100 \) adopters). For prefix hijacking, success rates are lower but still significant, e.g., about 40% even when 25% of the top 400 ISPs adopt.

#### Impact of Collateral Benefit and Damage

Figure 7 quantifies how partial enforcement of ROV at the core of the Internet can mitigate prefix and subprefix hijacks for prefixes covered by ROAs. We consider different probabilities of adoption \( p \) and different numbers of expected adopters \( x \) (between 0 to 100), chosen randomly.

#### Benefit from ROV Adoption Not at the Core

We also quantify the benefit that an AS not at the core can derive from adopting ROV. Our results in Figure 8 show the attacker’s success rate in harming (disconnect or hijack) ASes that enforce ROV for different rates of partial ROV adoption at the core of the Internet. Our results indicate that enforcing ROV does not provide a substantial additional benefit to such ASes, especially against subprefix-hijacking (see the similarities between Figures 7a and 8a for prefix hijack, and Figures 7b and 8b for subprefix hijacks).

### Today’s Status

We explore the security benefits provided by today’s ROV enforcement at the Internet’s core. We compare two cases: (1) the current deployment state of ROV at the top 100 ISPs, and (2) a scenario where all of the top 100 ISPs enforce ROV. Figure 9 contrasts these two scenarios (compare the green and red lines). We measure the attacker’s success rate for prefix and subprefix hijacks for different ROV adoption probabilities of all other ASes on the Internet. We observe that if all top 100 ISPs enforce ROV, the security benefits of RPKI are dramatically improved. In contrast, under today’s enforcement, prefix hijack attacks are likely to succeed, and subprefix hijacks remain very effective even if all other ASes on the Internet enforce ROV (about 60% success rate, see Figure 9b).

### Conclusion

Our simulation results suggest that enforcement of ROV at the core of the Internet, particularly by the top ISPs, is both necessary and sufficient for gaining substantial benefits from RPKI. Consequently, until a large fraction of these ISPs enforce ROV, other ASes have limited incentive to issue ROAs for their prefixes (since they will remain largely unprotected).

### Insecure ROAs

We expose a new vulnerability of RPKI that renders about a third of IP prefixes covered by ROAs insecure from traffic hijacking attacks, even if ROV is ubiquitously adopted. A ROA is considered loose if not all subprefixes of the maximum length allowed by the ROA are advertised in BGP. For example, if the max-length is set to /24, but only a /20 subprefix is advertised in BGP by the legitimate origin AS. Our analysis reveals that almost 30% of the IP prefixes covered by ROAs fall into this category.

#### Real-World Example

Swisscom, a large Swiss ISP, issued a ROA for the prefix 81.62.0.0/15, with origin AS 3303, specifying a max-length of 24. However, Swisscom only announces two /16 subprefixes in BGP. This exposes it to the attack where the attacker can announce through BGP its two /17 subprefixes 81.63.0.0/17 and 81.63.128.0/17 with AS-path 666-3303 to hijack all traffic to the prefix 81.63.0.0/16. To mitigate the attack, Swisscom should change the max-length in their ROA to 16.

### Obstacles to Deployment

We investigate the root causes for RPKI and ROV’s low adoption. Our measurements reveal that only a few of the top ISPs enforce ROV, leading to a circular dependency between issuing ROAs and adopting ROV. Additionally, unreliability due to badly issued ROAs and inter-organization dependencies contribute to non-deployment. Unlike past studies, our analysis relies on a breakdown of ROAs by organizations, providing new insights into RPKI and ROV’s deployability.

#### Mistakes in ROAs

Operators must specify the AS number, IP prefix, and maximum length in ROAs. Unfortunately, mistakes commonly occur. For example, Orange (formerly France Telecom) issued a ROA for IP prefix 194.2.0.0/15, specifying the origin AS number as 3215. However, many of Orange’s customers did not issue ROAs, rendering their BGP advertisements invalid according to RPKI. This disconnects them from ROV-enforcing ASes.

#### Survey Findings

Fear of being disconnected from other ASes due to invalid ROAs is the most common reason for not performing ROV (over 30%). We associate badly issued ROAs and corresponding BGP advertisements with organizations to gain deeper insights into the human error factor in RPKI deployment.
