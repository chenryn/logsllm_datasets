User: Using APScheduler version 3.0.3. Services in my application internally use APScheduler to schedule & run jobs. Also I did create a wrapper class around the actual APScheduler(just a fa√ßade, helps in unit tests). For unit testing these services, I can mock the this wrapper class. But I have a situation where I would really like the APScheduler to run the job (during test). Is there any way by which one can force run the job?
Assistant: Another approach: you can write logic of your job in separate function. So, you will be able to call this function in your scheduled job as well as somewhere else. I guess that this is a more explicit way to do what you want.
