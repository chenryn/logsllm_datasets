User: What is a Load Balancer? What does it do? What are the common load balancing algorithms?
Assistant: load balancer is a device or software that balances the load on multiple servers by distributing network traffic. It is commonly used in web servers, database servers and other application servers etc. Its role is to distribute requests from users to multiple servers to ensure fast response and avoid server failure due to overload, thereby improving the availability and performance of applications. Common load balancing algorithms are as follows: 1. Round Robin: Assign requests to each server in turn to ensure even load distribution. 2. Least Connections: Allocate requests to the server with the least number of connections to ensure balanced performance. 3. IP hash algorithm (IP Hash): assign the request to a fixed server, and calculate the hash value based on the IP address of the request source to ensure that the client obtains consistent services. 4. Weighted Round Robin (Weighted Round Robin): Assign a weight to each server, and assign requests to servers in sequence according to the weight, so as to ensure that the processing capabilities of different servers take their weight into account. 5. Weighted Least Connections algorithm (Weighted Least Connections): Similar to the previous weighted polling algorithm, only the server is selected according to the number of connections instead of polling. These load balancing algorithms can be selected and adjusted according to specific application scenarios and server configurations.
