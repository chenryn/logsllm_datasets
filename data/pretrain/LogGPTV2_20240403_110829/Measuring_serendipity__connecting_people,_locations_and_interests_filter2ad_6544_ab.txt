the earth’s sphericity in to account2. We have two points
to make. First, most human movements occur over short
distances, however, humans are also likely to travel large dis-
tances, albeit with smaller probabilities. This result is in line
with previous ﬁndings [9, 20]. Second, inter-session move-
ments, despite containing less information about users’ lo-
cations than intra-session, still exhibit similar displacement
probabilities. Hence, lack of information about locations
visited by the user when he was oﬄine, does not undermine
our ability to estimate mobility patterns.
2.3 Extracting Application Interests
Next, we show how we extract a user’s application interest
by classifying the URL visited. We only have access to the
ﬁrst part of the URL and not the actual parameters that
are being exchanged with the website. Hence, user privacy
is preserved in this respect as well.
Consequently, we classify the URLs accessed by users into
application interests via keyword mining over the URL. We
distinguish the following categories: dating, gaming, mail,
maps, MMS, music, news, photo, ringtones, search, social
networking, trading, travel, video and weather. A compre-
hensive list of the classiﬁcation rules we employ is provided
in Table 2. Some keywords, e.g., google, yahoo and msn rep-
resent portals from where users can access diﬀerent services
(e-mail or search). Hence, in order to distinguish between e-
mail (keyword: mail) and search (keywords: google, yahoo,
msn) we apply the mail rule ﬁrst.
Furthermore, every time we see a URL accessed by the
user, we extract the last location that the user was seen
at. Each of these application accesses are also encapsulated
in the corresponding packet data session by considering the
times at which the user logged on and oﬀ from the network.
In the rest of the paper, we present results for only the
2As earth is not a perfect sphere, our calculations are an
approximation, which however is suﬃcient for our purposes.
3Note, that the music interest category comprises of both
downloads as well as streaming music.
following interests: dating, social networking, music, e-mail,
trading, and news for the following reasons: (i) categories
social networking, dating and music represent interests and
goals which can serve as triggers for users to arrange for a
serendipitous meeting; (ii) categories e-mail and news rep-
resent the urge to stay connected to friends and world events
and; (iii) category trading represents a potential location-
based market place where people interested in buying and
selling goods in same geographic area could be matched up.
We opportunistically emphasize other applications as and
when necessary.
One limitation of our study lies in the fact that our trace
does not contain device type information. Indeed, certain
devices have characteristics which make them attractive for
a speciﬁc purpose, for example they can be easily used as
navigation tools or for sending e-mails. Such extra features
that are device-dependent can have a bias on our analy-
sis. Also, recently, mobile service providers have started
commercializing modems that can be used with personal
computers such as laptops. Users can use these devices to
connect to the Internet from anywhere within the cellular
network. One concern is that these devices do not constrain
the user (in terms of application accesses) in the way a lim-
ited resource platform such as a mobile phone might. Such
modem devices exist in the network that we have analyzed,
although in a relatively small proportion compared to the
total devices; they number a few hundred as informed by
the provider.
3. FROM HUMAN MOVEMENT TO APPLI(cid:173)
CATION USAGE
Here, we explore basic human mobility patterns, and then
study the relationship between movement and locations on
one hand and application usage on the other.
3.1 Basic mobility patterns
We ﬁrst develop a methodology to extract basic mobility
patterns exhibited by users. Then we provide initial insights
about inter- and intra-session movement properties. Finally,
we study movement predictability.
3.1.1 Binary trajectory rules
We develop a methodology based on association rule min-
ing [25] to extract binary rules which group movement and
stationarity events with one antecedent and one consequent,
e.g., users who are present at one location who then move
to another location. This methodology also allows us to
identify location boundaries (source to target location) that
become popular at certain times of day, e.g. due to work
commutes as well as locations which are popular with sta-
tionary users, e.g. residential and work areas. We will later
use this methodology for identifying hotspots in Section 4.
First, note that a user who is accessing the mobile data
network from a certain location (base-station) has the fol-

Figure 3: Hours of day when inter-session rules are active
lowing three possible exit states: (1) user moves to a new
location either while staying connected via the same session
(intra-session movement) or logs-oﬀ and logs back again via
a new session (inter-session movement); (2) user stays at
the same location (intra- or inter-session stationary) and;
(3) user switches-oﬀ his mobile device (disappear) and does
not re-appear for some time. Equivalently, a user can be de-
ﬁned to have the following three entry states with respect to
a location: (1) user appears in the location for the ﬁrst time
via a new session; (2) user stayed in the location from the
past and; (3) user entered the location from a diﬀerent one.
We will explore the entry states of a user later in Section 5.
Here, we deﬁne the following three rules to group users with
respect to their exit states:
Definition 1. Movement Rule:
Group all users ui from the user-set U who are present at
location xi, from where the user accessed the network via a
session at time ti ∈ time window w and whose next location
is xj 6= ∅ either within the same session or via a new session
before time ti + δ.
Given δ, ∀ui ∈ U, obtain groups (xi, xj 6= ∅, w, δ) s.t.
∃tj ∈ (ti, ti + δ] : xi, ti ∈ w =⇒ xj, tj .
Definition 2. Stationary Rule:
Group all users ui from the user-set U who are present at
location xi, from where the user accessed the network via a
session at time ti ∈ window w and has since been present
at the same location xi either via the same session or a new
session, since time ti up until the time ti + δ.
Given δ, ∀ui ∈ U, obtain groups (xi, xi, w, δ) s.t.
∀tj ∈ (ti, ti + δ] : xi, ti ∈ w =⇒ xi, tj.
Definition 3. Disappear Rule:
Group users who were present at location xi at time ti ∈
window w and who since then have switched-oﬀ their device
up until ti + δ seconds.
Given δ, ∀ui ∈ U, obtain groups (xi, ∅, w, δ) s.t.
∀tj ∈ (ti, ti + δ] : xi, ti ∈ w =⇒ ∅, tj.
Deﬁne support for a rule as the number of users that
follow the antecedent, i.e., that were present at location xi
within the time window w. Deﬁne conﬁdence for the rule
as the number of users who follow the rule, e.g., for the inter-
session movement rules, those who move from location xi to
location xj. Thus, conﬁdence probability for a rule is
deﬁned as the probability that users who have followed the
rule antecedent so far will follow the consequent as well and
is given by: conf idence/support. We consider time windows
of length one hour in this paper and hence the time window
variable w takes values at the hour boundaries.
3.1.2 Inter(cid:173)session Movement
Next, we consider the movement and stationary events
which occur across sessions. In order to group users by their
inter-session movements and stationarity alone, we only con-
sider the movements and stationarity shown by a user across
two consecutive sessions in Deﬁnitions 1-3.
We next identify the times of day when rules of a partic-
ular type are active. To achieve this, we cluster all inter-
session movement (stationary, disappear) rules that occur
in the same time window w irrespective of locations xi or
xj associated with them. In this case, we choose δ as four
hours, which is close to the average inter-session stationary
time (4 hours 25 minutes). Figure 3 shows the averaged
conﬁdence probability of each rule type over an hour win-
dow for two days, one during the week and another over
the weekend. The total support in terms of number of users
present across all locations at a given hour is also plotted
(see y2 axis). First, the total conﬁdence probabilities of all
the rules at a given hour add to 1.0. Second, conﬁdence for
disappear rule dominates.
We derive the following insights: (i) Stationary rules have
a larger average conﬁdence probability than movement rules
during the hours of the night, 10 pm-5 am for Wednesday
and 8 pm-7 am for Sunday. This is indicative of users being
more stationary during the night than day and during the
weekend than during the week; (ii) Finally, two local peaks
at 8 am and 5 pm in Figure 3(a) shows increased group be-
havior on a workday, i.e., moving towards work and back.
No such local peaks occur on the weekend. Note that the
conﬁdence probability is by deﬁnition normalized by the val-
ues of the support at the considered time interval. Therefore
the ratio between the values of conﬁdence for the hours of
the day and the hours of night is larger than the ratio be-
tween the values in the conﬁdence probability for the hours
of the day and the hours of the night.
3.1.3 Intra(cid:173)session Movement
Considering all the sessions generated over seven days,
we quantify how much mobility is captured within a user’s
packet data session. While a majority 84% of sessions stay
stationary (that is stay within one base-station), and 6%
271move for 15 minutes or less, the 99%-ile is 3.5 hours and the
maximum time that a session spends in motion is one day. A
user could divide his time within a session as both moving
and being stationary. Once again, about 84% of sessions
are completely or 100% sedentary while 6% of sessions are
completely mobile. Finally, about 10.2% of sessions spend
more time moving than staying within a session, i.e., percent
time spent within a session moving is larger than staying.
3.1.4 Daily Trajectories
Next, we investigate the predictability in users’ behavior.
In this regards, we identify the number of locations that a
user visits every day across all the days that he is seen in
the trace. First, for each user we build a daily trajectory
by combining the sequence of locations that are visited by
the user starting from the midnight of a day up until mid-
night of the next day. We use the locations corresponding
to both intra- and inter-session movements for a user while
building the daily trajectory. Next, given a user, we use his
daily trajectory to extract the set of unique locations that
he accessed that day. Say, a user was seen over 3 days such
that he accessed the following sets of locations: {A, B, C},
{A, B} and {A, C} on those 3 days respectively. Then we
compute the overlapping set of locations for this user as:
{A, B, C}∩ {A, B}∩ {A, C} = {A}. Interestingly more than
70% of the mobile users visit at least one common location
on every single day that they access the network, suggesting
that users regularly revisit their usual locations. We will
explore this aﬃnity of users to certain locations in the rest
of this section.
3.2 Application Usage
Here, we explore the following two questions: (i) What
