RUBLsub lists, we investigate the following: For a given IP
address or domain, determine whether it is being blocked;
if yes, determine how the blocking is performed. We focus
on three common types of blocking: TCP/IP blocking, DNS
manipulation, and keyword based blocking based on deep
packet
inspection. DNS manipulation and keyword based
blocking can actuate censorship explicitly by returning a
blockpage, or implicitly by forcing a timeout or returning
a TCP RST.
Detecting TCP/IP Blocking: We use ZMap to attempt a
TCP handshake with each IP address in RUBLip and in the
expanded RUBLsub list. Running this test produces a set of IP
addresses that successfully responded to our TCP SYN packet
with a TCP SYN-ACK packet. Any IP addresses that do not
respond are considered to be blocked, since these IP address
were responsive in our control measurement phase.
Detecting Resets and Timeouts:
Some censors, when observ-
ing an undesirable keyword, drop the packet that forces the
connection to timeout or reset the TCP connection. To detect
this, we request each domain in RUBLdom interspersed with
benign domains such as example.com by locally resolving
the domain on the vantage point and attempting a HTTP GET
request for the domain. This is to ensure that this behavior is
not due to transient network errors. If the tests for the benign
domains succeed but RUBLdom domains fail, we classify this
as censorship due to resets or timeouts, based on the error type
received during our test.
Detecting DNS and Keyword Based blocking: More typically
when a censored domain is requested, ISPs that employ this
method of blocking respond with a blockpage. Detecting
blockpages from other unexpected error pages such as server-
side blocking errors (e.g. HTTP status code 403), and page not
found errors (e.g. status code 404) is not a trivial task. There
have been multiple blockpage detection methods proposed in
previous work to reduce manual effort [37], [47].
Building on the methodology from Jones et al. [37], our
blockpage detection algorithm works as follows: we apply
single-link hierarchical agglomerative clustering to HTML
web pages to detect blockpages. We extract representative
unigrams and bigrams from the clusters under the assumption
that pages known from anecdotal sources [7] to contain Russian
phrases equivalent to “Access Restricted” and “Roskomnadzor”
are usually blockpages, while other sites would not normally
contain this kind of language. This is further conﬁrmed
by Rozkomnadzor’s own recommendations for blockpage
content [69].
Using these representative unigrams and bigrams, we
manually create regular expressions to match known blockpages.
We then validate these regular expressions by grouping pages
with the exact same content. We verify that the groups with
pages matching the regular expressions contain only blockpages
(no false positives). Since ISPs typically return the same
blockpage for every censored domain, the groups that do not
match any regular expressions are not likely to be blockpages,
which we manually conﬁrm to eliminate false negatives.
We designed tests that use RUBLdom as the input
to
characterize DNS and keyword based blocking by employing
the decision logic laid out in Figure 1. We explain each test
and provide a walk through of the ﬂowchart below.
Test 1: For every domain in RUBLdom, we send a GET
request from all of our vantage points within Russia, allowing
the domain to locally resolve. For all responses that did not
contain an error (resets and timeouts categorized and treated
separately), we check whether the returned web page matches
at least one of the blockpage regular expressions, and if so
classify them as “blocked”. If this ﬁrst request is not “blocked”,
we determine that the domain is not censored. If the request is
6
is not blocked from this third request, we classify the type
of blocking as “Others”. Upon investigating what falls under
this category, we observed that there are instances where a
combination of DNS and TCP/IP blocking is applied, i.e. the
actual website is not accessible from the vantage point, even
though a blockpage was not received; the reasons may be that
the connection was reset or DNS resolution failed every time.
Test 4: If Test 2 is blocked, we look at the result of the
GET request with only the IP address resolved from Russia
(the same as Test 3), and observe the response. If this is not
blocked we can safely conclude that the blocking was only
triggered by the presence of the domain name in the request,
and thus was blocked at the application layer by keyword based
blocking.
Test 5: If Test 4 is blocked, we look at results from the
ﬁnal GET request with only the IP address that was resolved
from the control machines. If this request is blocked, we can
again deﬁnitively declare keyword based blocking, based on
some keyword in the response from the site also acting as the
trigger. If it is not blocked, we can only be certain that it is
either DNS manipulation, keyword based blocking, or both.
In cases where we are unable to distinguish keyword based
blocking and DNS manipulation we compare the resolved IPs
in the Russian vantage points to the resolved IPs in our controls
and the answers which are deemed “Not Blocked” in Satellite.
The results of this experiment are described in Section VI.
D. Conducting Remote Measurement
Our direct measurements provide a high-ﬁdelity, in-depth
view of Russian information control, particularly from the
data center and residential network perspectives. However,
acquiring these vantage points is quite resource intensive, and
our measurements are inherently limited by the number of
vantage points we can obtain. To complement this data, and to
determine whether our direct measurements are representative,
we use two remote measurement tools: Satellite [58], [70]
and Quack [78]. Remote measurement tools such as Satellite
and Quack use the behavior of existing Internet protocols
and infrastructure to detect censorship, i.e. researchers do
not need to obtain access to vantage points but just interact
with remote systems to learn information about the network.
Satellite remotely measures DNS manipulation using open
DNS resolvers and Quack detects application-layer blocking
triggered on HTTP and TLS headers using Echo servers. These
remote measurements select only vantage points that are part
of organizational or ISP infrastructure, hence providing a
complementary perspective to direct measurements.
1) Obtaining Remote Vantage Points: With operational help
from the Censored Planet team [9], we used 357 open DNS
resolvers in Russia located in 229 different ASes (197 unique
ISPs), and 718 Echo servers located in 208 different ASes (166
unique ISPs). As shown in Table I, this increases our coverage
considerably. We annotate the vantage point locations with the
Maxmind GeoIP2 database [46], and ﬁnd the AS information
through RouteViews data [68].
2) Identifying Censorship: On our behalf, the Censored
Planet team performed Satellite and Quack using RUBLdom
based on the techniques described in [78] and [70]. Both
Figure 1: Decision graph for detecting DNS and Keyword
Based blocking—Four requests are issued: using the domain
resolved from a local DNS resolver, using the domain and
control IP resolved from every control vantage point, using
just the IP resolved in Russia, and using just the IP resolved
in controls. We decide whether the request is blocked based
on whether the HTML response matches the blockpage regular
expressions. (cid:5)
blocked, we must identify the method of blocking using the
results of the following tests.
Test 2: We make another HTTP GET request for the domain,
this time using the domain and every unique IP that the domain
resolves to in each of the control vantage points. We then pass
the web page from the response to our blockpage detection
algorithm.
Test 3: If the web page from this Test 2 is not blocked,
we look at the result of a GET request for just the IP of the
domain resolved in Russia (without the domain name). If the
response is classiﬁed as blocked from our blockpage detection
algorithm, we only know that the domain is either blocked at
the application layer by keyword based ﬁltering (if the Russian
IP actually points to the site), DNS poisoning (if the Russian
IP does not point to the site), or both (if the Russian IP does
not point to the site but a blockpage was injected before the
connection could reach the poisoned address). If the response

tools have their own methods to label a domain as being
“manipulated” or “blocked”. Satellite creates an array of ﬁve
metrics to compare the resolved IP against: Matching IP,
Matching HTTP content hash, Matching TLS certiﬁcate, ASN,
and AS Name. If a response fails all of the control metrics, it
is classiﬁed as blocked. Quack ﬁrst makes an HTTP-look-
alike request to port 7 of the Echo server with a benign
domain (example.com). If the vantage point correctly echoes
the request back, Quack then requests a sensitive domain. Quack
makes up to four retries of this request in case none of the
requests are successfully echoed back. If the vantage point
fails for all 4 requests, Quack tries requesting a benign domain
again to check whether the server is still responding correctly.
If so, the failure to echo back the sensitive domain is attributed
to censorship.
IV. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Censorship measurement studies involving active network
measurement raise important ethical considerations. Most
censorship measurement studies, including ours, aim to trigger
censors from various vantage points which might cause risk of
retribution from local authorities. Aiming to set a high ethical
standard, we carefully designed our experiments to follow or
exceed the best practices described in the Belmont [51] and
Menlo [16] reports. Before initiating any of the measurements,
we consulted with our university’s IRB, who determined that we
were exempt from regulation but advised us to discuss with the
university’s General Counsel, which we did. We vetted the risks
of our study and shaped our data collection methods through a
year of continuous communication with prominent activists
within Russia, with colleagues experienced in censorship
and measurement research, and with our university’s General
Counsel.
Gaining background understanding of the laws of the
country is imperative to designing ethical measurements. Prior
to engaging with us, our activist collaborators had been actively
participating in open-source projects such as OONI and Tor, and
had traveled outside of Russia to present details about Russian
censorship in international forums. Their guidance was essential
for us to ensure we were aware of Russian law and policy
regarding accessing censored content. These collaborators
facilitated renting VPSes and running measurement from the
residential probes.
Our direct measurements involve sending requests for
potentially censored content from vantage points inside Russia.
This creates a potential risk to participants who own and
control these vantage points. We consulted with our activist
collaborators, who assured us that even if the anonymized
vantage points, data centers, or ISPs are discovered, there has
never been any punitive action on the part of the Russian
government or others against entities who do not comply with
the blocklist. We then begin the process of obtaining informed
consent from participants by customizing the OONI consent
form which was drafted by the Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic and
attached in the Appendix E). This form documents in detail the
measurements performed and data collected and seeks explicit
approval. Before our activist collaborators asked participants
to run measurements from residential probes, they used our
consent form and drafted an email in Russian to solicit explicit
consent from the volunteers, who were recruited from a tech-
savvy population already involved with activist groups that
advocate for Internet freedom.
We obtained our VPSes from commercial VPS platforms,
whose operators understand the risk in offering network and
computing services. In collecting the data from our VPS
platform, we did not subject anyone in Russia (or elsewhere)
to any more risk than they would already incur in the course
of operating a VPS service.
Our remote measurements seek only vantage points that
are not owned or operated by end users and are part of
organizational or ISP infrastructure. As in the case of our VPSes
and residential probes, there is a possibility that we place the
operators of these remote vantage points at risk. Again, there
is no documented case of such an operator being implicated in
a crime due to any remote Internet measurement research, but
we nonetheless follow best practices to reduce this hypothetical
risk. From the list of all available open DNS resolvers in Russia,
we identify those that appear to be authoritative nameservers
for any domain by performing a reverse DNS PTR lookup
and only select those resolvers whose PTR begins with the
regular expression “ns[0-9]+|nameserver[0-9]”. Similarly, we
ran Nmap on all the Echo servers in Russia and exclude those
whose labels do not indicate an infrastructural machine. Using
only infrastructural vantage points decreases the possibility that
authorities might interpret our measurements as an attempt by
an end-user to access blocked content. Moreover, we initiate
the TCP connection and send the sensitive requests, and there
is no communication with the actual server where the sensitive
domain is hosted. We also set up reverse DNS records, WHOIS
records, and a web page served from port 80 on each machine
in the networking infrastructure we use to run measurements, all
indicating that our hosts were part of an Internet measurement
research project.
We also follow the principle of good Internet citizenship
and reduce burden on the vantage points by rate limiting
our measurements, closing TCP connections, and maintaining
only one concurrent connection. Our ZMap and ZGrab scans
were conducted following the ethical guidelines proposed by
Durumeric et al. [17], [19].
V. DATA CHARACTERIZATION
The most recent sample of RUBL contains 132,798 unique
domains and 324,695 unique IP addresses. It also contains
a list of 39 subnets ranging from /24s to /16s. This section
characterizes both the full RUBL blocklist and the ﬁnal ﬁltered
list obtained after running control measurements described in
Section III-B.
A. IPs and Subnets
As mentioned in Section III, we examined the responsive-
ness of the IPs on the blocklist. Only 121,025 IPs on the
blocklist (37.3%) were reachable from our controls. Our control
measurements were highly concordant; over 99% of IPs that
were reachable at some control vantage point were reachable
at all control vantage points. The low rate of responsiveness
(37.3%) might be the artifact of our measurement, as these IPs
might be alive but not responding on port 80, such as proxies
conﬁgured on custom ports.
