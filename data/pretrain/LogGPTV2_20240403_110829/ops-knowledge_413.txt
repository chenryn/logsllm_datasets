User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: If you are working with command prompt and if you are facing the issue even after adding python path to system variable PATH.
Remember to restart the command prompt (cmde.exe).
