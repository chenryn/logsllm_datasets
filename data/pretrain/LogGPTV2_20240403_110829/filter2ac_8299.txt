**ATT&CK Technique Name: User Account Management**

To prevent misuse and ensure that users and user groups have appropriate permissions for their roles, implement robust Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls. Specifically, create individual user accounts for each person who needs access to the repositories. This approach enforces role-based access and provides non-repudiation of actions, enhancing security and accountability.
