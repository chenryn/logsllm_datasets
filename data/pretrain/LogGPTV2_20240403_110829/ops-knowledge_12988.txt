User: I am running two different Python scripts on a Ubuntu VPS. One of them is the production version, and the other one is for testing purposes.
From time to time, I need to kill or restart one of them. However ps does not show which script does each Python process runs.
What is the conventional way to do this?
Assistant: ps -AF will give you All processes (not only the ones in your current terminal, or run as your current user), in Full detail, including arguments.
