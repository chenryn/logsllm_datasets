User: How to use Jenkins for CI/CD deployment and monitor its execution?
Assistant: Here are some steps and instructions: 1. Create a new project in Jenkins, select "Build a free-style software project". After completing this configuration, click "Save". 2. On the project configuration page, choose the Source Control tab, and then choose your repository type and location. 3. Configure a build trigger, which can be a regular scheduled build or a build triggered when the code repository is updated. 4. In the Build Environment tab, add any required build environment variables or parameters. 5. In the Build tab, add the commands or build scripts that you need to run and send the build output to the target server or operating system. 6. In the Post-Build Actions tab, add any subsequent commands or scripts that perform tasks. 7. In order to monitor the CI/CD process, you can use the "Console Output" feature provided by Jenkins to view the build log. You can also use other tools such as Splunk or Grafana to monitor and analyze the process. 8. In order to monitor the process more comprehensively, you can use Jenkins plug-ins and extensions, such as the Jenkins Pipeline plug-in and the Blue Ocean visual interface to build a visual continuous delivery pipeline.
