The following provider does not actually work:
    const fooToken = const OpaqueToken('fooToken');
    Injector.resolveAndCreate([
      new Provider(fooToken, useFactory: () => 'Bar')
    ]);
Instead, it only works if you change the signature to
    new Provider(fooToken, useFactory: () => 'Bar', deps: const [])
Can the default be `deps: const []` instead of failing?
