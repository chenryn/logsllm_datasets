ABSTRACT 
In  this  paper  we  show  that  any  user  of  a  VoIP  service  over  a 
private network, even one without a special attack capability (e.g., 
wiretapping), can discover calls between two targeted individuals, 
with  high  probability.  We  conducted  this  privacy  attack  in  an 
experimental  setting  using  three  types  of  commercially  available 
closed-source  phones  that  implement  the  standard  IETF  Session 
Initiation  Protocol  (SIP)  in  hardware.  We  show  that  private  call 
records  can  be  probabilistically  derived  by  using  a  new  class  of 
side-channels  caused  by  resource  contention.  By  sending  care-
fully  designed  VoIP  packets  and  analyzing  the  responses,  an 
ordinary  user  can  detect  the  busy  status  of  SIP  phones  without 
alerting either the caller or the callee. Hence an ordinary user can 
correlate the busy status of two given phones, or more, can detect 
calls  between  them.  We  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  our 
remote  attack  on  three  commercial  closed-source  phones,  and 
discuss countermeasures.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
On  January  10,  2010,  the  Washington  Post  reported  that  the 
FBI  broke  US  law  by  illegally  obtaining  over  2,000  records  for 
phone  calls  made  by  US  citizens  (call  logs,  but  not  call  content) 
without  obtaining  a  “national  security  letter,”  as  required  by  the 
Patriot  Act  of  2001  [28].  Since  a  call  record  does  not  contain 
information about the call (e.g., voice patterns, data, content), one 
cannot help but wonder: What makes the collection of call records 
such  an  attractive  data  source  as  to    cause  the  FBI  to  break  US 
law?  Furthermore,  why  would  the  FBI  break  the  law  for  so  few 
records,  as  compared  to  similar  actions  by  the  NSA,  which 
collected over 1.9 trillion call records between 2001 and 2004 [1, 
19] ? These few records must provide important information.

those  obtained  from  different 
Call-record analysis is one of the oldest tools used in defense, 
law-enforcement,  and  business  intelligence.  Call  records  enable 
an analyst to discover the social milieu of targeted individuals, or 
groups.  For  example,  a  call-record  database  allows  both  single 
link  (e.g.,  time,  initiation,  duration,  frequency  of  a  call)  and 
cluster  analysis  of  calls  in  the  temporal,  spatial,  and  frequency 
domains.  It  can  also  indicate  overlaps  among  different  clusters, 
such  as 
investigations,  and 
similarity  of  clusters,  such  as  those  obtained  when  a  group  of 
targets  changes  their  phone  numbers  (to  avoid  tracking)  but  not 
their  communication  habits.    Relatively  small  call-record  sets, 
well  under  10,000  records,  have  been  sufficient  to  discover  a 
variety of law-breaking operations worldwide, ranging from drug 
trafficking  in  New  Zealand  [29],  to  drug  smuggling  in  a 
Minnesota  prison, 
to  surreptitiously  charging  unsuspecting 
pornography  clients  with  expensive  and  unwanted  900-number 
phone  calls  in  Moldova  [19].  Even  smaller  sets  of  call  records 
have  been  used  to  (illegally)  detect  boardroom  leaks  in  a  major 
US corporation [20].  
The question that motivates the privacy attack reported in this 
paper is the following: would call-record analysis be possible in a 
private  VoIP  network?  Specifically,  a  private  VoIP  provides 
anonymity  for  callers  and  callees,  and  for  their  relationship  [24]. 
Informally,  this  means  that  the  caller  and  callee’s  phones  are 
indistinguishable  from  other  phones  in  the  VoIP  network,  and 
neither  the  caller  nor  the  callee  can  be  linked  to  each  other.  In 
such  a  setting,  end-to-end  encryption  would  force  end-point 
invasive  wiretapping,  or even end-host malware/Trojan insertion, 
for call-record collection. This would be an expensive proposition, 
which  would  undoubtedly  require  additional  legal  work,  such  as 
court  orders,  and  would  face  increased  odds  of  detection  by  the 
owners  of  the  targeted  phones.  While  a  private  VoIP  network  is 
yet  to  be  fully  achieved  in  practice,  a  low-latency  encrypted 
channel using  with one or  more (trusted)  forwarding  proxies  is  a 
reasonable  approximation1 of  such  a  network  and  could  become 
the medium of choice for the private calls in the rapidly growing 
VoIP  communications  [3,  17].  In  this  paper,  we  answer  our 
motivating  question  affirmatively,  by  showing  that  any  user  of  a 
private VoIP network  without any special attack capability – not 
just  a  powerful  government  agency  equipped  with  a  national 
security  letter  –  can  discover  private  calls  between  two  or  more 
1 Low-latency  anonymous  networks  provide  anonymity  through 
multiple forwarding proxies where anonymity is still maintained 
even if some of the proxies are compromised. Current deployed 
systems such as Tor and I2P cannot provide low enough latency 
for  VoIP  to  become  practical  (<400ms  delay).  However, 
commercial 
such  as  anonymous.com  provide 
anonymity through a trusted proxy (VPN) where latency is low 
enough.

the relationship privacy of two or more phone users and can have 
unpredictable effects, as we argue below.  
the  busy-status  detection  should be  undetectable  (not  alerting  the 
phone  end-users); otherwise  the  end-users  of  the targeted  phones 
can easily recognize the anomaly and stop using these phones.  
Adversary  Definition.  In  Figure  1,  attack  targets  Alice  and 
Bob  establish  a  VoIP  session.  The  session  can  be  delivered  over 
one  or  more  forwarding  proxies  to  provide  anonymity,  if  its 
latency  satisfies  the  needs  of  VoIP  (i.e.,  <400ms  latency 
recommended  by  ITU-T  G.114;  longer  latency  tolerance  for 
tactical environments)  [3, 4, 13, 17]. The forwarding proxies can 
be  implemented  in  the  network  layer,  transport  layer,  or 
application layer.  Adversary Eve’s goals are to discover whether 
Alice  and  Bob  communicate  with  each  other  using  the  private 
VoIP  network,  the  duration  of  the  conversation,  and  if  possible, 
the  call  initiator.  2    Eve  can  also  perform  link  analysis  and 
determine  the  strength  of  ties  between  Bob  and  Alice.    The  tie 
strength  can  be  accurately  measured  by  interaction  frequency, 
evidence  of  recent  communication,  communication  reciprocity, 
and the existence of at least one mutual friend in linking the two 
targeted parties [7].  
Our  adversary  Eve  does  not  need  any  added  capabilities 
beyond those of an ordinary user. As shown in  Figure 2, she can 
send  probe  VoIP  packets  to  the  targeted  phones  and  receive 
response  VoIP  packets  in  return,  and  need  not  have  any 
eavesdropping  capabilities.    Yet  her  probing  is  undetectable3 by 
the  end-users  of  the  targeted  phones  unless  the  phone  logs  or 
network  traffic  are  analyzed;  i.e.,  her  packets  alert  neither  Alice 
nor Bob that their phones are being probed remotely.  
Attack Overview. The simplest attack consists of the two steps 
illustrated  in  Figure  3.  In  the  first  step,  the  Eve  detects  whether 
both  Alice’s  phone  and  Bob’s  phone  are  busy;  i.e.,  she  performs 
busy-status  detection  for  both  phones.  In  the  second  step,  Eve 
verifies whether Alice’s phone and Bob’s are busy, or not busy, at 
almost  the  same  time;  i.e.,  she  performs  call  correlation.  If  the 
phones’  busy  statuses  correlate,  then  Alice  and  Bob  probably 
share  a  VoIP  call  session during  Eve’s  probing  period.  Note  that 
2 In addition to the hypothetical role of an eager FBI agent lacking 
a  national  security  letter,  Eve  could  alternatively  be  a  jealous 
girlfriend  wanting  t  to determine  whether  her  boyfriend  Bob  is 
cheating with her best friend Alice. 
3  We  assume  the  unsuspecting  end-user  of  a  targeted  phone 
accesses  the  phone  via  the  handset,  hook,  buttons,  rings,  and  a 
display. 
Resource  contention  is  what  makes  it  possible  to  detect  a 
phone’s  busy  status  in  a  private  VoIP  network.  The  resource, 
namely  the  protocol  buffer,  is  used  to  store  the  contexts  of  the 
VoIP  protocol  negotiation.  Certain  VoIP  packets  (e.g.,  call-setup 
packets)  create  a  state  machine  in  both  the  caller  and  callee 
phones. The context of the state machine, including the status and 
timer, is stored in a  slot of the protocol buffer.  When the desired 
action  is  completed  or  times  out,  the  buffer  slot  occupied  by  the 
call  is  released.  Call-termination packets  can  expedite  buffer  slot 
release if the buffer slots are occupied due to call-setup packets.   
fixed-size  protocol  buffers  can  cause 
In  some  VoIP  phones,  including  those  implemented  with 
dedicated  hardware,  the  protocol  buffer  is  a  fixed-size  array.  As 
expected, 
resource 
contention.  For  example,  in  a  protocol  buffer  containing  N  slots, 
the  call  setup  occupies  1  slot  and  the  remaining  N-1  slots  are 
available for other protocol instantiations. This implies that if the 
adversary can detect the number of available protocol buffer slots, 
she  can  determine  a  phone’s  busy  status.  She  can  do  this  by 
periodically  sending  VoIP  packets,  which  would  overflow  all 
available protocol buffer slots of the targeted phone, and detecting 
whether a full-buffer condition is signaled back. By examining the 
response  to  a  full-buffer  condition,  the  adversary  can  count  the 
number of available protocol buffer slots in a targeted phone. This 
enables the adversary to detect the phone’s busy status in a matter 
of  seconds  –  much  faster  than  with  any  of  the  current 
eavesdropping/flow-analysis  methods.  Rapid 
busy-status 
detection makes our  attack  feasible in any private VoIP network. 
For our privacy attack experiments, we selected the IETF Session 
Initiation  Protocol  (SIP),  which  has  been  widely  adopted  by  the 
telecommunication  industry,  the  military,  cable  operators,      and 
consumers at large. Theoretically, the proposed attack  may apply 
to 
the 
telecommunication  signaling  network  (e.g.,  having  a  Private 
Branch Exchange).

Contribution.  The  main  contribution  of  this  paper  is  the 
definition of  a  new,  powerful  attack  against  call-records  privacy, 
which is launched with ordinary-user capability and succeeds with 
very  high  probability  in  private  VoIP  networks.  This  attack  not 
only indicates that a fixed-size buffer in a SIP phone can result in 
private  information  leakage,  but also  implies  that  other  exclusive 
resources,  such  as  operating  system  resources  (e.g.,  semaphore; 
number  of  threads)  may  enable  privacy  breaches  in  SIP  or  other 
VoIP phones.    We  tested our  attack  in  closed-source  commercial
