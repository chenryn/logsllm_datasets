### D. Discussion

We have experimentally demonstrated that ACL is highly effective in identifying the community of a given honest seed and provided formal guarantees for the rankings it produces. To our knowledge, this is the first time formal guarantees have been provided for a community detection algorithm in the context of sybil defense. While we have shown that ACL can effectively solve Problem 1, the next section reveals a sobering reality: all state-of-the-art methods based on random walks, including ACL, are ineffective against some simple, primitive sybil attacks encountered in deployed social networks.

### VII. Avoiding the Maginot Syndrome

Our analysis in Section II of the resilience of different structural properties of social graphs indicated that leveraging the complementary notions of mixing time and conductance is the most promising line of defense against sybil attacks. Techniques based on this approach can provide impressive end-to-end guarantees. However, a key question remains: how effective are these techniques against actual sybil attacks?

While data on sybil attacks in deployed social networks is not readily available, two recent papers provide experience reports that shed light on the types of attacks occurring in the wild.

- **Cao et al.** reported successfully using SybilRank to identify sybil users in the Tuenti social network [7]. They observed large clusters of sybil users in regular topologies (star, mesh, tree, etc.) connected to the honest communities through a limited number of attack edges. They also noted that an unspecified fraction of the remaining accounts were sybil but could not report the number or characteristics due to confidentiality constraints.
- **Yang et al.**'s experience in analyzing the RenRen social network was significantly different [43]. They did not observe large clusters of well-connected sybil nodes connected to the honest sub-graph through a small set of attack edges, as expected by the sybil defense techniques we have surveyed. Instead, they found isolated sybil nodes each connected to the honest sub-graph with a large number of attack edges.

The simple attack observed in the RenRen social network is devastating for conductance-based protocols. We simulated this attack on our Facebook graph and measured the probability that a randomly chosen honest node would be considered more trustworthy than a randomly chosen sybil node by various protocols. A probability of 1 corresponds to the ideal case where every honest node is ranked higher than any sybil node; a probability of 0 indicates the reverse case; a random ranking corresponds to a probability of 0.5. Our results show poor performance across all protocols:
- SybilLimit: 0.45
- SybilGuard: 0.44
- Mislove: 0.34
- Gatekeeper: 0.49
- ACL: 0.37

The vulnerability of conductance-based techniques to an attack where each sybil node can create more than one attack edge is fundamental, as proven by Yu et al. [45].

These experiences indicate that while today's socially-based sybil defenses are designed to provide the theoretically best defense posture, they are easily circumvented, much like the real-life Maginot Line.

#### A. Defense in Depth

To avoid this fate, we believe effective sybil-defense mechanisms should adopt a strategy inspired by the notion of defense in depth [34]. Rather than relying solely on conductance-based techniques, they should include a portfolio of complementary detection techniques. For example, Yang et al. [43] observed that it is possible to spot sybil nodes by tracking their clustering coefficient (see Section II) and the rate at which their friendship requests are accepted. In the RenRen graph, both of these metrics are significantly higher for honest nodes than for sybils. As a rule of thumb, Yang et al. suggest reporting as sybil those users whose friendship-request acceptance rate is less than 50% and whose clustering coefficient is below 1/100. This approach correctly identifies more than 98% of the sybils, with a false positive rate of less than 0.5%.

While these results are impressive, they are not cause for unconditional celebration, as a slightly more sophisticated adversary can easily circumvent both checks by issuing friendship requests to other sybil nodes under their control. However, such checks make the attacker's task more difficult and prevent more sophisticated defenses from being trivially sidestepped. Indeed, they may even nudge the attacker towards the kind of attacks where conductance-based methods can start to be effective. For instance, simply introducing a defense layer that monitors the rate of friendship acceptance introduces a bound (albeit loose) on the conductance of the cut between honest users and sybils.

In particular, assume that honest users accept sybil requests with probability \( p \) and that the threshold of accepted requests below which a node is flagged as sybil is \( T \). Then the following simple result holds (see [2] for the proof):

**Proposition 3.** Sybil nodes, to avoid detection, must create fewer than \( \frac{p(1-T)}{T-p} \) of their edges as attack edges.

For example, if honest users accept friendship requests with probability \( p = 10\% \) and \( T = 50\% \) (as in [43]), then each sybil node must have seven links to sybil nodes for every attack edge to avoid detection.

**Proposition 3** bounds the conductance of the cut between honest and sybil nodes in the sense that whenever the sybil region has fewer edges than the honest region, the conductance of the cut is at most \( 2 \frac{p(1-T)}{T-p} \).

While this bound is loose, it is encouraging that it can be obtained through a defense layer based on a fairly primitive measure such as the rate of friendship acceptance. We speculate that in the near future, new defense layers based on advanced machine-learning and profiling techniques [33] will force a sybil attacker who wants to escape detection to generate sybil regions that resemble actual social graphs, connected through a sparse cut of attack edges to the honest portion of the graph: in other words, exactly the scenario suitable for conductance-based sybil defense.

### VIII. Conclusions

This work has traced the evolution of social sybil defenses from the seminal work of Yu et al. [46] to the developments of the last several years [7], [10], [35], [45] to recent reports [7], [43] that detail their usage in practice. We have identified two main trends in the literature:

1. **Random Walk Methods:** These aim to identify fast-mixing (sub)regions that contain the honest seed. The implicit assumption is that social networks under sybil attacks exhibit a simple structure—a fast-mixing region of honest nodes connected via a sparse cut to the sybil region. This initial simplified picture has become more nuanced, leading to methods based on random walks that can cope with a more complex world consisting of tightly-knit, fast-mixing communities loosely connected among themselves and to the sybil region.

2. **Community Detection:** While we have revealed the limitations of this approach, we have also highlighted its core validity. As we have shown with our discussion on Personalized PageRank, the two approaches can go hand in hand to yield more robust sybil defense protocols that are competitive with the state of the art. The discussion has highlighted the importance of the body of literature that studies foundational issues on random walks. Both algorithms and useful conceptual tools can be distilled from it and successfully deployed in the context of sybil defense.

Despite their growing mathematical sophistication, sybil defense methods can perform poorly when confronted with some real-world attacks that exhibit a very primitive structure. We believe that the defense-in-depth approach we have advocated as a response to this challenge can be facilitated by moving from the original vision of offering individual honest users decentralized and universal sybil defense [45], [46] towards defense techniques that assume the defender has complete knowledge of the social graph topology [7], [43] and can deploy the kind of parallelizable implementations suitable for handling the large graphs of online social networks. In particular, social network operators are in a position to use machine learning techniques, user profiling, and monitoring of user activity to gain additional knowledge that can help them filter sybil attacks not well-suited for detection using techniques based on random walks, community detection, and their combination. Still, as attackers increase in sophistication, claims of a silver bullet should be met with healthy skepticism. As the arms race between attackers and defenders continues, it will be increasingly important that new defense mechanisms clearly state the kind of attack they aim to withstand, a landscape that too often is blurred.
