https://codepen.io/megacromulent/pen/gdMYLx?editors=1010
### Steps to reproduce
  1. Create vue app with items displaying in a list.
  2. Add transition group with **v-for** with format like **v-for="(item, index) in items"**
  3. Use "index" from v-for as the **v-bind:key** (like: v-bind:key=" **index** " )
  4. Add and remove items from the data.
### What is expected?
The item being removed/added should have the transition applied to it.
### What is actually happening?
The last item in the list gets the transition applied.

This may be an old bug, as I was hunting for a solution to my problem, I ran
into this from May 2017:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43598308/vue-js-wrong-transition-group-
animation-position
If this is the intended behavior using index as the key, then can their be at
least a warning message in the dev version of Vue.js to explain this? Or
perhaps searchable text in the documentation with something like "only last
item in list is animating/transition applied" so a solution can be found
without thinking there is a bug in Vue.js.
