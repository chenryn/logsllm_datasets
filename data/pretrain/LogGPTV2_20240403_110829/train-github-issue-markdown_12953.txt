Hi,
Pairplot with diag_kind = "kde" used to work with version 0.9.0 but it fais
with version 0.10.0.
Error message: RuntimeError: Selected KDE bandwidth is 0. Cannot estiamte
density.
Current version: seaborn 0.10.0 , matplotlib 3.1.3
Dataset: Publicly available data of Wisconsin breast cancer  
Dataset is attached.  
breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.zip
Link to dataset:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original)
Code Script:  
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
col_names = ['id', 'Clump Thickness', 'Uniformity of Cell Size',  
'Uniformity of Cell Shape', 'Marginal Adhesion',  
'Single Epithelial Cell Size', 'Bare Nuclei', 'Bland Chromatin',  
'Normal Nucleoli', 'Mitoses', 'Class']  
df = pd.read_csv("breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.csv", names=col_names,  
header=None)  
df['Bare Nuclei'].replace("?", np.NAN, inplace=True)  
df = df.dropna()  
import seaborn as sns  
sns.pairplot(df , diag_kind = "kde", hue="Class")
Comment: The dataset contains discrete values with very less variation in
values (but variation is not zero, the values vary from 1 to 10 though
majority have repeating value hence Variance is low). Low variation is
probably causing the error in KDE.
