First you need to create an LVM volume group, and then create one or more logical volumes in it. Extend the file system to the logical volume, and finally expand the logical volume to expand the capacity of the file system. 4. Expand the capacity of the file system The last step is to expand the capacity of the file system through the capacity expansion tool of the file system.

For specific steps, refer to the documentation of the file system expansion tool. It should be noted that before expanding the file system, be sure to back up important data, and follow the safe operation rules during the expansion process to avoid data damage or loss.
