User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Wbadmin email alert on failure Does anyone have a script they use with WBADMIN to send email alerts? I am a scripting newbie and having trouble finding a solution to notify on failed backups. Seems like it would be a useful tool to have.

I am running Server 2008 R2 Foundation and backing up to a NAS. I am using wbadmin with task scheduler to perform daily backups.

UPDATE
We do not have a budget for third party solutions so I am trying to effect a solution through a simple script.

Assistant: If you've already had a failed backup it should be easy enough to accomplish by finding the failed backup in the Backup|Operational event log, right-clicking the failed event, selecting "Attach Task to this Event", and filling out the task settings appropriately.

Then whenever a backup fails and logs the event to the log, an email will be sent based on your task configuration.
