  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
This is using almost the exact example from the documentation for the
responsive drawer. I expect the drawer to close when I either click away from
the drawer or make the window large again.
## Current Behavior
The drawer does not close as expected as the `onClose`method is never fired.  
I'm getting this compile error in TypeScript which is also reflected in Visual
Studio Code
`Property 'onClose' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & DrawerProps
& { children?: ReactNode; }'.`
All other properties are found and behave as expected
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Copy&Paste the example code from the Responsive Drawer into a TypeScript
project in Visual Studio Code.  
You may also need to do some casting to `any` as the styling stuff doesn't
really play nice with TS at the moment.
