## Issue Report

### Search Confirmation
- [x] I have thoroughly searched the repository's issues and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
I am using an example almost identical to the one provided in the documentation for the responsive drawer. The expected behavior is for the drawer to close when:
1. The user clicks away from the drawer.
2. The window is resized to a larger size, causing the drawer to no longer be in the "open" state.

### Current Behavior
The drawer does not close as expected because the `onClose` method is never triggered. Additionally, I am encountering a TypeScript compilation error in Visual Studio Code:

```
Property 'onClose' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & DrawerProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'.
```

All other properties are recognized and function as expected.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Copy and paste the example code for the Responsive Drawer into a TypeScript project in Visual Studio Code.
2. You may need to cast some components or props to `any` due to current compatibility issues between Material-UI and TypeScript.

### Environment
| Technology | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Material-UI | 1.0.0-beta.22 |
| React      | 16.2.0  |

| TypeScript | 2.6.2   |
