The campus is still a net consumer of Internet traﬃc, and there are two main
explanations for it. First, a large subset of campus services is being hosted in
the cloud, such as Microsoft Oﬃce365 and Learning Management System (LMS).
Second, our ﬁndings show that video streaming and entertainment services are
signiﬁcant contributors to campus traﬃc, even in 2020. However, the increase in
outbound traﬃc volume after the lockdown has reduced the degree of asymmetry.
Figure 1 also shows several distinct outages in monitor data collection (e.g.,
a week in late March, plus a few days in May, late July, and mid-October).
These outages were due to intensive scanning attacks on the university network
that crashed our monitor. These attacks were more frequent and more extreme
during the pandemic than in the previous year. The main takeaway here is that
campus network traﬃc has changed in both expected (e.g., decline in inbound,
increase in outbound) and unexpected ways (e.g., intensive scanning attacks).
4.2 Structural Analysis
To better understand the changes in network traﬃc, we ﬁrst examined the traﬃc
volumes for hypergiants, such as Google and Microsoft. Table 1 shows the Top
10 external organizations based on total byte traﬃc volume (in Gigabytes) on a
weekday in Fall 2019 (Day2019: 2019-09-24). As a representative day, this table

illustrates the pre-pandemic traﬃc pattern for hypergiants. Apple tops the list at
5.4 TB/day, due to the multiple services it oﬀers, such as iCloud and Apple TV.
Netﬂix (5.1 TB/day) is second with a large number of subscribers and high pop-
ularity. The other organizations are popular hypergiants, with some primarily
oﬀering their own services, such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, and oth-
ers providing network infrastructure and CDNs (Content Delivery Networks),
such as Akamai, Amazon, and Fastly. CANARIE is Canada’s national research
and education backbone network, connecting Canadian universities, educational
institutions, and research organizations to each other and to the Internet.
Table 2 shows the results for the corresponding day in 2020 (Day2020: 2020-
09-23) to illustrate hypergiant traﬃc during the lockdown. Signiﬁcant changes
in usage patterns are evident in this table, with Amazon and Akamai now at
the top, and signiﬁcant declines for Apple and Netﬂix. The latter declines are
attributable to fewer users on campus. Table 2 also shows Shaw (a major ISP in
western Canada) that was not even in the top 20 on Day2019.
One interesting observation when comparing Tables 1 and 2 is that while
traﬃc for most organizations declined signiﬁcantly from Day2019 to Day2020,
Amazon’s traﬃc increased substantially from 1.9 TB/day to 3.3 TB/day. One
contribution to this growth is Zoom, since its services are mainly deployed on
AWS, and expanded during the pandemic [2]. In particular, Zoom’s traﬃc on our

campus rose from 34 GB on Day2019 to 1,358 GB on Day2020, and represents
about 4% of total campus traﬃc. The key takeaway is that Zoom traﬃc, at over
1.3 TB/day, is now comparable to the traﬃc of other hypergiants.
Insights can also be gleaned by looking at the internal breakdown of campus
network traﬃc. Table 3 shows pre-pandemic traﬃc on Day2019, broken down
by subnets within our campus network. The top subnets on this list include a
BYOD subnet for unmanaged devices, campus WiFi subnets, student residences,
and some popular locations with NAT access to the Internet.
Table 4 shows the corresponding traﬃc breakdown for Day2020 to represent
internal subnet traﬃc patterns during the pandemic. While the top three sub-
nets remain the same, their traﬃc volumes are much lower, since fewer users are
on campus. Several new subnets appear in Table 4, including a subnet for VPN
traﬃc, and a subnet used by UCalgary’s administration to update the campus
community about the pandemic situation. The labels (numbers in parentheses)
for these subnets show their relative pre-pandemic rankings on Day2019. Also
of note, the traﬃc volumes from several student residences2 decreased, since
occupancy was limited; these subnets no longer appear in the Top 10. The main
insight from our analysis is that there were signiﬁcant structural changes in net-
work usage, both internally and externally. For example, VPN and Admin usage
rose, while RezNet and WiFi decreased. The latter contribute to the concomitant
decreases in Apple and Netﬂix traﬃc.
4.3 Authentication
Our next analysis focuses on the authentication-related traﬃc, as we study the
network usage patterns of our campus community during the pandemic. All
faculty, staﬀ, and students must authenticate themselves with their credentials
when using enterprise services, such as email, LMS, VPN, and so on.
Figure 2 shows the authentication-related traﬃc for two selected weeks from
our empirical dataset: one in September 2019, and the corresponding one in
2 We have not analyzed the residence traﬃc in detail, since the number of users seems
low. Ulkani et al. [31] studied pandemic eﬀects on student residence traﬃc at UCSD,
ﬁnding changes (for example) in Zoom and OSN usage.
