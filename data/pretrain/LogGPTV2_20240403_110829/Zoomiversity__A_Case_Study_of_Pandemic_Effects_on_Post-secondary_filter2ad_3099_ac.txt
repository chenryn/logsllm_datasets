### Campus Network Traffic Patterns

The campus remains a net consumer of internet traffic, and this can be attributed to two primary factors:
1. **Cloud Hosting of Campus Services:** A significant portion of campus services, such as Microsoft Office365 and the Learning Management System (LMS), are hosted in the cloud.
2. **Video Streaming and Entertainment:** Our findings indicate that video streaming and entertainment services are major contributors to campus traffic, even in 2020.

However, the increase in outbound traffic volume following the lockdown has reduced the degree of asymmetry in traffic. Figure 1 also highlights several distinct outages in monitor data collection, for example, during a week in late March, a few days in May, late July, and mid-October. These outages were due to intensive scanning attacks on the university network, which crashed our monitoring system. These attacks were more frequent and severe during the pandemic compared to the previous year. The key takeaway is that campus network traffic has changed in both expected (e.g., decline in inbound, increase in outbound) and unexpected ways (e.g., increased scanning attacks).

### Structural Analysis

To better understand the changes in network traffic, we first examined the traffic volumes for hypergiants like Google and Microsoft. Table 1 shows the top 10 external organizations based on total byte traffic volume (in Gigabytes) on a weekday in Fall 2019 (Day2019: 2019-09-24). This table illustrates the pre-pandemic traffic pattern for hypergiants. Apple leads the list with 5.4 TB/day, primarily due to its multiple services, including iCloud and Apple TV. Netflix (5.1 TB/day) follows closely, driven by its large subscriber base and high popularity. Other organizations include popular hypergiants, some offering their own services (e.g., Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) and others providing network infrastructure and CDNs (e.g., Akamai, Amazon, and Fastly). CANARIE, Canada’s national research and education backbone network, connects Canadian universities, educational institutions, and research organizations to each other and to the Internet.

Table 2 presents the results for the corresponding day in 2020 (Day2020: 2020-09-23) to illustrate hypergiant traffic during the lockdown. Significant changes in usage patterns are evident, with Amazon and Akamai now at the top, and notable declines for Apple and Netflix. These declines are attributable to fewer users on campus. Shaw, a major ISP in western Canada, was not even in the top 20 on Day2019 but appears in the 2020 data.

One interesting observation is that while traffic for most organizations declined from Day2019 to Day2020, Amazon's traffic increased substantially from 1.9 TB/day to 3.3 TB/day. This growth is partly due to Zoom, whose services are mainly deployed on AWS and expanded during the pandemic. Specifically, Zoom's traffic on our campus rose from 34 GB on Day2019 to 1,358 GB on Day2020, representing about 4% of total campus traffic. The key takeaway is that Zoom traffic, at over 1.3 TB/day, is now comparable to the traffic of other hypergiants.

### Internal Subnet Traffic Breakdown

Insights can also be gleaned by examining the internal breakdown of campus network traffic. Table 3 shows pre-pandemic traffic on Day2019, broken down by subnets within our campus network. The top subnets include a BYOD subnet for unmanaged devices, campus WiFi subnets, student residences, and some popular locations with NAT access to the Internet.

Table 4 shows the corresponding traffic breakdown for Day2020, representing internal subnet traffic patterns during the pandemic. While the top three subnets remain the same, their traffic volumes are much lower due to fewer users on campus. Several new subnets appear, including a subnet for VPN traffic and a subnet used by UCalgary’s administration to update the campus community about the pandemic situation. The labels (numbers in parentheses) for these subnets show their relative pre-pandemic rankings on Day2019. Additionally, traffic volumes from several student residences decreased, as occupancy was limited, and these subnets no longer appear in the Top 10. The main insight from our analysis is that there were significant structural changes in network usage, both internally and externally. For example, VPN and Admin usage rose, while RezNet and WiFi decreased, contributing to the concomitant decreases in Apple and Netflix traffic.

### Authentication-Related Traffic

Our next analysis focuses on authentication-related traffic, as we study the network usage patterns of our campus community during the pandemic. All faculty, staff, and students must authenticate themselves with their credentials when using enterprise services such as email, LMS, and VPN.

Figure 2 shows the authentication-related traffic for two selected weeks from our empirical dataset: one in September 2019 and the corresponding one in September 2020. The graph displays the number of connections initiated to the authentication servers. 

### Changes in Authentication Connections

Figure 3 illustrates changes in authentication connections from September 2019 to September 2020 based on the countries of origin. The maximum numbers in the legends (under the maps) demonstrate the maximum change that a country experienced, i.e., an increase (in Canada) for (a) and a decrease (in Hong Kong) for (b).
