User: am sorry for that question,
am beginning in Tornado, and because i come from two other frameworks: Flask and Django, Flask uses Werkzeug which is a WSGI webserver, Django uses WSGI too, but, when making an application programmed with Tornado, how it will deal with HTTP? there is a protocol to deal with python files when it comes to internet? or do i mess something about WSGI?
NB: i know also that Tornado has a WSGI support, for example it can serve Django application, but i mean with a native Tornado application, which protocol it uses?
Assistant: Tornado shouldn't use WSGI, because WSGI is not async friendly. It has WSGI support, but it won't support async.
Tornado has its own HTTP server (written in C and Python), and can be used standalone or placed behind another async HTTP server (usually Nginx).
