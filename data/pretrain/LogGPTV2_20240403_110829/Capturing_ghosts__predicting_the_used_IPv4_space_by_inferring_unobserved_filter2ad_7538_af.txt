the allocation process changes the number of available blocks. In-
stead, our model uses the observation that the probability that a

This is consistent with the estimate of 0.26–0.36 mil-
lion by the independent LLM model for the period ending at 30
June 2014, providing evidence for the validity of both models.
7.2.1 Router FIB limitations
One of the reasons that the distribution of preﬁx sizes is impor-
tant is that each routed preﬁx requires an entry in a router’s For-
warding Information Base (FIB), and there is a prima facie risk
that allocating all unused preﬁxes could overﬂow the FIBs. Above
we estimated that including the unrouted space there are 0.78 mil-
lion preﬁxes that are /24 or larger. Currently, there are more than
0.5 million routed preﬁxes already (but a substantial fraction is un-
used). In 2007 Juniper [30] stated that its M120 and MX960 had
FIB capacities of about 2 million IPv4 routes, and that IPv4 FIBs
with approximately 10 million entries are feasible within a few
years if demand exists. In addition, FIB compression techniques
can reduce size of FIBs [30]. This suggests that it will be feasible
to use and route all less than 1.3 million available preﬁxes. Even if
unused preﬁxes are subdivided further, it appears feasible to route
them all. However, some existing routers may require upgrades.
7.2.2 Estimated years of supply
In July 2014 roughly 5.5 /8 networks of unallocated addresses
remained [1] – equivalent to 350,000 /24 networks or 90 million
addresses. Even if in addition to these all 4.4 million routed but
unused /24 subnets could be prised away from their current owners,
/24 networks would be exhausted in 2024 under the current growth
trend of 0.45 million /24 subnets per year. Unused routed IPv4
addresses would be exhausted in 2023 given the current growth of
170 million addresses per year.
The overall estimate hides the diﬀerences between regions. Ta-
ble 6 shows the available space (unallocated space plus allocated
publicly routed unused space based on our CR estimates), the cur-
rent average growth rate over our measured time period and the
predicted year supply will run out (under the very optimistic as-
sumption that the whole unused space could be utilised) for IPs and
/24 networks for each RIR. For most RIRs the number of years of
IP supply is equal or smaller than the number of years of /24 net-
works supply. This is because either the IP and /24 growth rates
are similar or the IP growth rate is larger, but there are signiﬁcant
numbers of unused IPs in used /24. RIPE is an exception due to
similar growth rates for IPs and /24s and signiﬁcant supply in al-
ready used blocks. At current growth rates ARIN and RIPE have
14+ years of IP supply left, but AfriNIC has only 8–9 years of sup-
ply left, and LACNIC and APNIC have only 2–4 years of supply
left. Any future reallocations between RIRs to ease local pressures
would change these numbers of course.
However, it appears unlikely that the whole IPv4 space will ever
be completely utilised. If the overall utilization of routed /24 sub-
nets remains below, say 75%, the current growth rates suggests
four years of remaining supply overall. Moreover, in this case re-
gions with tight supply, such as APNIC and LACNIC, would be ex-
hausted within one year. APNIC stands out, because its IP growth
rate is much larger than its /24 growth rate with unused IPs in used
/24s depleted soon. We expect a slowdown shortly – in fact Fig-
ure 6 suggests it may have begun already. An open question is the
large amount of unrouted IPv4 space, much of which has not been
routed for years. Unused parts of the unrouted space might provide
a short-lived increase in IPv4 supply.
Over the next one to two years, we expect IPv4 exhaustion to
be increasingly felt, resulting in a brief growth in the IPv4 address
market. Most organizations holding unused addresses do so for
operational reasons – to allow expansion or ﬂexibility, or in one
case as a /8 darknet – but some may be holding them to sell if
the market price rises suﬃciently. The numbers in this paper may
guide how long they can expect to be held for, assuming that the
market will collapse once IPv6 is widely adopted. However, this is
complicated by the fact that the very act of selling a large block of
IPv4 addresses will delay the implementation of IPv6, and hence
prolong the IPv4 market.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Our key contribution is describing and demonstrating a new sta-
tistical capture-recapture technique for improved estimation of the
true population of both observed and unobserved (yet still active)
IPv4 addresses from diverse sources of active and passive measure-
ment data. This technique reﬁnes our community’s understand-
ing of IPv4 address space exhaustion and consequent incentives for
IPv6 adoption.
Data from nine sources over the past three years suggests 5.9
million used /24 subnets and 740 million used IPv4 addresses. Yet
our CR technique indicates a signiﬁcantly higher 1.2 billion IPv4
addresses in use across 6.3 million /24 subnets, with usage growing
at around 0.45 million /24 subnets and 170 million IPv4 addresses
per year. Asia and Europe have the highest numbers of used IP ad-
dresses, while Africa and South America show the fastest growth.
Based on the overall estimates, at the very best unallocated plus
routed but unused addresses will last until 2023. More likely, if
say only 75% of routed /24 subnets could ever be used, supply will
be exhausted in 2018. Moreover, Asia and South America are the
two “pressure points” that will experience a shortage of addresses
within the next one or two years.
Previous sales of IP addresses saw prices of US$8–17 per IP
depending on the sizes of the blocks sold [31, 32]. At an average
price of US$10 per IP address, the 4.4 million routed unused /24
subnets have a value of over US$11 billion. However, probably
only a small fraction of those will be sold, so even if prices rise
substantially, the eventual market value is likely to be smaller.
Our ability to collect more IP data for validating or improving
our estimates, or potentially detecting more hosts (e.g. private
servers), is limited by common privacy restrictions. We plan to ex-
plore an enhanced method [33] for securely applying CR to multi-
source measurement data without revealing which IPv4 addresses
each source contains.
