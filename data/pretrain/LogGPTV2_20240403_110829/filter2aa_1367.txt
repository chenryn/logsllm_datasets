### What is a Rogue Cell Tower?
A rogue cell tower, also known as an IMSI catcher, interceptor, cell-site simulator, Stingray, or other names, is a device created by governments or hackers. It tricks your phone into thinking it is a legitimate cell phone tower. These devices can collect information about you indirectly through metadata (e.g., call length, dialed numbers) and, in some cases, even intercept the content of messages, calls, and data.

### How are Cell Simulators Used Today?

#### In the United States:
- **Law Enforcement:** U.S. law enforcement agencies use IMSI-catchers to locate, track, and collect data on suspects.
- **ACLU Report:** The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has identified 66 agencies and 24 states that own Stingrays.
- **Public Demonstrations:** These devices have been used to monitor demonstrations, such as political protests in Chicago.
- **DIY Projects:** It is possible to build an IMSI-catcher at home. For example, Chris Paget demonstrated this at DEFCON 18 with "Practical Cellphone Spying."

#### Abroad:
- **Global Use:** Reported use in Ireland, the UK, China, Germany, Norway, and South Africa.
- **Spam and Phishing:** Chinese spammers have been caught using these devices to send spam and phishing messages.
- **Government and Corporate Use:** Both governments and corporations use these devices for various purposes.

### What is the IMSI in "IMSI-Catcher"?
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity):** A unique identifier for a device on a cellular network, typically 15 digits long.
- **Components:**
  - **MCC (Mobile Country Code):** Identifies the country.
  - **MNC (Mobile Network Code):** Identifies the carrier within the country.
  - **MSIN (Mobile Subscription Identification Number):** A unique identifier for the device.
- **Example IMSI:**
  - `310` (MCC) – USA
  - `260` (MNC) – AT&T
  - `123456789012345` (MSIN) – Unique Identifier

### Why Should You Care?
- **Automatic Connection:** Your phone will automatically connect to cell site simulators.
- **Personal Information Theft:** Thieves can steal your personal information.
- **Tracking and Data Interception:** Hackers can track your movements, intercept your communications, and gather other data about you.
- **Privacy Risks:** Your digital life can be exposed to anyone with the right technical skills and equipment.
- **Corporate Risks:** Companies may leak trade secrets.
- **Privacy Threats:** Your privacy is at risk.

### Why Build a Detector?
- **Existing Solutions:** There are apps for Android phones that can detect cell tower anomalies, but they require specific phone models and root access.
- **Desired Features:**
  - **Affordable:** ~$50 per device.
  - **Set and Forget:** Easy to deploy and maintain.
  - **Alerts:** Notify of any anomalies.
  - **Networked Devices:** Ability to connect multiple devices for better coverage.

### How to Detect a Rogue Cell Tower?
- **Cell Tower Information:**
  - **ARFCN (Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number):** Remains constant.
  - **MCC (Mobile Country Code):** Remains constant.
  - **MNC (Mobile Network Code):** Remains constant.
  - **Cell ID:** Unique identifier within a large area.
  - **LAC (Location Area Code):** Remains constant.
  - **Txp (Transmit Power Maximum):** Remains constant.
  - **Neighboring Cells:** List of nearby cells.
  - **Power Level:** Remains relatively stable.

- **Detection Indicators:**
  - **New Tower:** Unknown Cell ID, high transmission power.
  - **Code Mismatch:** MCC or MNC mismatch.
  - **Frequency Change:** Unexpected frequency changes.
  - **LAC Mismatch:** Location Area Code mismatch.

- **Baseline Monitoring:** Establish a baseline of your cellular environment over time. Any deviations from the norm could indicate the presence of a rogue tower.

### How to Locate a Tower?
- **Single Detector:**
  - **Data Collection:** Combine unique cell tower data, receive power, and GPS location.
  - **Mapping:** Move a detector with onboard GPS around to create a map of readings, including unique tower identifiers, power levels, and GPS coordinates.
  - **Analysis:** Use math, open-source GIS software, and visualization tools to approximate the locations of towers or potential rogue towers.

- **Multiple Detectors:**
  - **Trilateration:** Use multiple detectors with known locations to triangulate the position of a suspected rogue tower.
  - **Regression Formulas:** Apply regression formulas to fine-tune results, although this method is less accurate than single-detector mapping.

### What's the Build?
- **Hardware:**
  - **Raspberry Pi 3:** Running stock Raspbian OS.
  - **SIM900 GSM Module:** For engineering mode and signal strength data.
  - **Serial GPS Module:** For location data.
  - **Software-Defined Radio (SDR):** USB TV tuner for listening to raw GSM traffic.
  - **Miscellaneous:** Scrap wood, hot glue, and other components.

- **Setup:**
  - **SIM900 GSM Module:**
    - **Engineering Mode:** Provides detailed information via a serial connection without requiring a SIM card.
    - **Signal Strength:** Monitors the seven towers with the highest signal.
  - **GPS Module:**
    - **Adafruit Ultimate GPS:** Quick position fixes, good indoor reception.
  - **Raspberry Pi 3:**
    - **Raspbian OS:** Debian-based OS for the Pi.
    - **USB Ports:** Four USB ports for serial adapters.
    - **Power Supply:** Can be powered by a USB battery pack.
  - **Software-Defined Radio (SDR):**
    - **GSM Traffic Listening:** Uses Gr-Gsm on GitHub to listen to raw GSM traffic.
    - **Optional:** Not necessary for locating cell towers but provides deeper insights.

- **Data Collection:**
  - **SQLite Database:** All collected data is stored in a SQLite database for later analysis.
