## Abstract
Fluid models are widely used in the performance modeling of computing systems and communication networks. When a model includes multiple types of agents, the size of the associated system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) increases, making the analysis more challenging. This paper addresses this issue for a class of models where heterogeneity is represented as a perturbation of certain parameters in the ODE vector field. We provide an a-priori bound that relates the solutions of the original, heterogeneous model to a smaller ODE system obtained by aggregating variables related to different agent types. By demonstrating that this bound grows linearly with the intensity of the perturbation, we formally justify the intuitive approach of neglecting small differences in agent behavior to reduce the dimensionality of the original system.

## 1. Introduction
Fluid (or mean-field) techniques have found applications in numerous stochastic models for the performance evaluation of computer systems, such as load balancing, optical switches, virtualized environments, and peer-to-peer networks. The fluid approach assumes that the system consists of a large number of statistically identical agents evolving over a set of discrete states. Under appropriate scaling, the stochastic process converges to a deterministic trajectory described by a system of ODEs.

In this paper, we study fluid models with explicit heterogeneity due to the presence of various types of agents. Typically, all agents are structurally similar but differ in the rate parameters for certain actions. For example, in a queueing system with generalized processor sharing (GPS), each service class has its own ODE in the fluid limit. As the number of classes increases, the analysis becomes more complex, especially when the model is used for capacity planning and no closed-form solution is available, requiring repeated numerical ODE integration with varying parameters.

A natural approach to addressing this problem is to reduce the dimensionality of the system via aggregation. The goal is to find a smaller ODE system whose solution can be related to that of the original system. Techniques for model reduction have been extensively studied, particularly in fields outside computer science and engineering. These techniques can be categorized as follows:
- **Lumping:** Projects the original system onto a smaller one.
- **Time-scale analysis:** Separates fast and slow activities in the system.
- **Sensitivity analysis:** Identifies the most influential variables on the overall system dynamics.

In this paper, we focus on lumping techniques for reducing the dimensionality of fluid models with heterogeneous agent types. We first review the concept of exact lumpability and study the conditions under which a linear mapping of the variables of an ODE system yields an aggregated system that can be analyzed without error. While these conditions are often too restrictive, we show that our notion of lumpability does not impose constraints on the initial conditions, extending the applicability of exact aggregation.

We use exact lumpability to measure the degree of heterogeneity in the model. By finding a suitable perturbation of the parameters, we can collapse distinct agent types into a single variable in a smaller ODE system. Our main result is the introduction of ε-lumpability, which provides an a-priori error bound that grows linearly with the intensity of the perturbation. This formalizes the intuitive idea that similar agent types can be aggregated into a single representative type without significant loss of information.

Not all fluid models with heterogeneous agent types are amenable to ε-lumpability. In this paper, we focus on a class of models for which sufficient criteria can be derived by examining the structure of the ODE vector fields without solving the ODEs. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through three case studies:
1. A multi-type model of epidemics.
2. A high-level model of bandwidth sharing between heterogeneous users.
3. A fluid model for a queueing network with GPS discipline.

We validate our results through numerical tests, comparing the a-posteriori error of the original and lumped models, and performing sensitivity analysis with respect to the degree of heterogeneity and the size of the lumped system. We find that even large perturbations in the parameters can be accommodated, resulting in negligible errors for practical purposes.

## 2. Exact Lumpability
In this section, we present some results on lumpability for dynamical systems and refer the reader to [27] for detailed proofs. We then provide a worked example.

### 2.1 Theory Overview
Let \( n \) be an integer, \( E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \), and \( f : E \to \mathbb{R}^n \) be a Lipschitz continuous vector field with constant \( L \). This ensures the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the ODE system:
\[
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t)),
\]
where \( \dot{x} \) denotes the derivative with respect to time \( t \).

Let \( \hat{n} \leq n \) be an integer, and let \( M \) be a \( \hat{n} \times n \) real constant matrix with rank \( \hat{n} \). We are primarily concerned with aggregation matrices, which induce a partition of the state space and have entries of either 0 or 1.

**Definition 1.** If for all solutions of (1), \( y(t) := M x(t) \) obeys an ODE system
\[
\dot{y}(t) = \hat{f}(y(t)),
\]
with some function \( \hat{f} : E \to \mathbb{R}^{\hat{n}} \), then the system (1) is said to be exactly lumpable to (2) by \( M \).

We analyze the system over a finite interval of time where both (1) and (2) admit unique solutions. The following results can be found in [27]. Although they were originally presented for twice continuously differentiable functions, they also hold for Lipschitz continuous functions, which is useful for modeling computing systems.

**Theorem 1 (see Theorem 1.2, [27]).** The system (1) is exactly lumpable to (2) by the matrix \( M \) if and only if
\[
M f = \hat{f} \circ M.
\]

**Theorem 2 (see Theorem 1.3, [27]).** The ODE system (1) is exactly lumpable to (2) by \( M \) if and only if
\[
M f = (M f) \circ \bar{M} M,
\]
where \( \bar{M} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times \hat{n}} \) is the generalized right inverse of \( M \) satisfying \( M \bar{M} = I_{\hat{n}} \).

**Theorem 3 (see Theorem 1.4, [27]).** If (1) is exactly lumpable to (2) by \( M \), then the right-hand side \( \hat{f} \) of the lumped system (2) does not depend on the specific choice of the generalized inverse of \( M \).

### 2.2 Lumpability for a Fluid Model for Bandwidth Sharing
Although fluid models with heterogeneous agent types are not typically amenable to exact lumpability, this notion will be instrumental for ε-lumpability. We also show how it can improve recent work on lumpability for fluid models in the context of process algebra [28].

Consider the ODE system:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}_1 &= - \frac{x_1}{x_1 + x_3} \left( \min(x_1 + x_3, x_5) \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 \right), \\
\dot{x}_2 &= \frac{x_1}{x_1 + x_3} \left( \min(x_1 + x_3, x_5) \alpha_1 - \alpha_2 x_2 \right), \\
\dot{x}_3 &= - \frac{x_3}{x_1 + x_3} \left( \min(x_1 + x_3, x_5) \alpha_1 + \alpha_3 x_4 \right), \\
\dot{x}_4 &= \frac{x_3}{x_1 + x_3} \left( \min(x_1 + x_3, x_5) \alpha_1 - \alpha_3 x_4 \right), \\
\dot{x}_5 &= - \min(x_1 + x_3, x_5) \alpha_1 + \alpha_4 x_6, \\
\dot{x}_6 &= \min(x_1 + x_3, x_5) \alpha_1 - \alpha_4 x_6,
\end{aligned}
\]
where \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_6 \) are positive reals. This model represents two classes of clients (variables \( x_1 \) and \( x_3 \)) exchanging data with a population of servers, \( x_5 \). Clients change state (respectively, \( x_2 \) and \( x_4 \)) with think times at rates \( \alpha_2 \) and \( \alpha_3 \). After each service, the server goes into sleep with rate \( \alpha_4 \). The data transfer dynamics consider \( \alpha_1 \) as the maximum bandwidth, and the bandwidth-sharing mechanism ensures that the two classes of clients receive service proportionally to the current load.

We consider the aggregating matrix \( M \) that lumps the two classes of clients:
\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

This matrix projects the original system onto a smaller one, allowing us to study the aggregated dynamics.
