## Preface

**Question:** What would happen if you built a system designed to accept barcode inputs but didn't perform any input validation?

---

## The EICAR String

- **What is the EICAR string?**
  - `X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*`
- **Who created it?**
  - The European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR)
- **What is it used for?**
  - To test antivirus software without using real malware.
- **How does it work?**
  - When an antivirus system detects this string, it should trigger an alert as if it were a real virus.

---

## QR Codes

- **What would happen if you combined the EICAR string with a QR code?**
- **Where did this whole thing start?**
- **Beyond a sticker on your car, what else could you do?**

---

## Real-World Example

- **Video Example:**
  - A friend sent me a video of a passport scanner at a port of entry.
  - Many countries now offer smartphone apps that generate QR codes for customs entry cards.
  - These QR codes can be read by passport machines.

**So, what happened here?**

- **Why does this "attack" work?**
  - Similar to how industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems were connected to the internet without considering security, many "smart" devices are being developed without proper security measures.
  - Most of these "smart" machines run on Windows or Windows Embedded, which are vulnerable to such attacks.

## Why Do Devices and Systems Scan QR Codes?

- **What other things might you be able to scan?**
- **Extensions of this "attack":**
  - There are many types of 2D barcodes, such as Data Matrix, Aztec, MaxiCode, MicroPDF417, and Han Xin.
  - Could you embed malicious JavaScript or direct someone to a malicious URL via a QR code?

- **What other systems might you be able to attack?**
- **What would happen if you encoded the EICAR string into an RFID tag?**

---

## RFID Tags in Use

- **ATMs often use Windows underneath.**
- **Railroads use RFID tags to track cargo containers.**
- **Retailers use RFID tags to combat theft and speed up checkout:**
  - Uniqlo
  - H&M
  - Zara
  - etc.

**You can buy just about anything on AliExpress or Amazon these days.**

---

## Legal Considerations

- **Is this legal?**
  - I am not a lawyer (IANAL).
  - But, what is the legality of walking around with a giant barcode on your backpack causing random camera systems to crash?
  - You didn’t give them permission to scan it, and shouldn’t they have input validation anyway?

## Want to Try It Out?

- **Stickers:**
  - Stickermule is a great site for small runs of stickers at a low cost.
  - Laser labels at home also work well.
- **Embroidered Patches:**
  - Google it. You’ll find it. Not going to shill my site here.
  - If you’re at DEF CON in person, come up and get a patch for free.
