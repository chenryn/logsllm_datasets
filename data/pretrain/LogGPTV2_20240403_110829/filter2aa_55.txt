• This video was sent to me by a 
random friend… I would never do 
something stupid like this.
• This is a passport scanner at a 
port of entry
• Many countries now offer people 
entering a smartphone app to 
digitally fill out their customs 
entry card… and that app creates 
a QR code that the passport 
machines can read…

Why does this “attack” work?
Free

Free 
PowerPoint

Much like ICS and SCADA where 
companies just "bolted-on" internet 
connectivity with zero thoughts of 
the security implications of doing so, 
companies are making devices 
"smart" and not really thinking very 
much about how people might be 
able to fuck with them.

Most of these “smart” machines are 
all running Windows or Windows

Could you take some malicious JS 
and have a system parse it?
Or just something as simple as 
sending someone to a malicious 
URL…

Some railroads use RFID tags on 
cargo containers to track the 
movement of cargo containers… and 
have for more than 20 years.

A whole bunch of retailers are using 
RFID tags now to combat theft and 
to make checking out way faster:

Uniqlo

H&M

Zara

etc.

Is this shit legal?
IANAL.

But what IS the legality of walking 
around with a giant barcode on your 
backpack causing random camera 
systems to crash?
You didn’t give them permission to 
scan it… and shouldn’t they have 
input validation anyway?

Want to try it out?
Stickermule is a great site to do 
small runs of stickers cheaply, but 
there are dozens others.
Laser labels at home work great.
