### Issue Description

This is a quality-of-life and cosmetic issue. I found that the compiler error in this specific case could have been more informative.

#### TypeScript Version
1.8.9

#### Code
```typescript
interface A { }
class B extends A { }
```

#### Expected Behavior
The compiler should generate an error message indicating that `A` cannot be extended because it is an interface. For example:
```
a.ts(2,17): error TS2304: 'A' is an interface and cannot be extended by a class.
```

#### Actual Behavior
The current error message is:
```
a.ts(2,17): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'A'.
```

This error message is misleading and does not provide clear guidance on the actual issue.
