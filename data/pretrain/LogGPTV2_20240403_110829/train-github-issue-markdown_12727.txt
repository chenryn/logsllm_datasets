This is a somewhat cosmetic/quality of life issue, but I found the compiler
error in this particular case could have been much more helpful.
**TypeScript Version:** 1.8.9
**Code**
    interface A { }
    class B extends A { }
**Expected behavior:** An error alluding to the fact that `A` cannot be
extended because it is an interface.
**Actual behavior:**
    a.ts(2,17): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'A'.
