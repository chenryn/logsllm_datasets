### Circuit Types in Tor Hidden Services

- **HS-IP Circuit**: This circuit is established between the Hidden Service (HS) and its Introduction Point (IP). Its primary function is to listen for incoming client connections. This circuit corresponds to arrow 1 in Figure 2.

- **Client-RP Circuit**: This circuit is built by a client to a randomly chosen Rendezvous Point (RP). The purpose is to eventually receive a connection from the HS after the client has expressed interest in establishing communication through the creation of a Client-IP circuit. This circuit corresponds to arrow 4 in Figure 2.

- **Client-IP Circuit**: This circuit is established by a client interested in connecting to an HS. It is built to one of the IPs of the HS to inform the service of the client's interest in waiting for a connection on its RP circuit. This circuit corresponds to arrow 5 in Figure 2.

- **HS-RP Circuit**: This circuit is established by the HS to the RP, which is chosen by the client, to facilitate communication with the interested client. Both this circuit and the Client-RP circuit connect the HS and the client over Tor. This circuit corresponds to arrow 6 in Figure 2.

### Experimental Setup

For our hidden service experiments, we utilized more than 1,000 hidden services listed on ahmia.fi [2], an open-source search engine for Tor hidden service websites. Our observations are based on logs collected over a three-month period from January to March 2015. This extended period is crucial for realistically modeling steady-state Tor processes, as Tor's circuit-building decisions are influenced by the distribution of circuit build times. Additionally, we configured our Tor clients to not use fixed entry guards (by setting `UseEntryGuards` to 0), thereby increasing the variety in our data collection and avoiding limitations to a few entry guards.

### Multiplexing Experiment

To understand how stream multiplexing works for Client-RP and Client-IP circuits, we deployed a single Tor process on a local machine, used by two applications: Firefox and Wget. Both applications automated hidden services browsing by selecting random .onion domains from our list. While Firefox paused between fetches to model user think times [19], Wget accessed pages sequentially without pausing to simulate a more aggressive use. The distribution of user think times had a median of 13 seconds, with a long tail ranging from 152 to 3,656 seconds for 10% of user think times. Since both applications shared the same Tor process, our goal was to observe how Tor multiplexes streams accessing different .onion domains. We logged the circuit on which each .onion incoming stream was attached.

**Observations:**
- Streams for different .onion domains are not multiplexed in the same circuit. When the Tor process receives a stream to connect to a .onion domain, it checks if an existing RP circuit is connected to it. If so, it attaches the stream to that circuit; otherwise, it builds a new RP circuit. This was verified by examining a 7-hour log, which showed around 560 RP circuits, each connecting to a different .onion domain.
- Tor does not use IP or RP circuits for general streams. For non-hidden servers, Tor uses general-purpose circuits, which can carry multiple logical connections. In contrast, streams accessing .onion domains are assigned to rendezvous-related circuits, which differ from general circuits. This behavior was confirmed through our experiments and by reviewing Tor’s specifications and source code.

### Hidden Service Traffic Experiment

The aim of this experiment was to understand the usage of IP and RP circuits from both the hidden server and client perspectives. We deployed a hidden service on the live Tor network, allowing clients to visit cached versions of any hidden service from our list, which we had previously crawled and downloaded. Our hidden service was accessed by five separate Tor instances, four using Wget and one using Firefox. Each client chose a random page from our list and requested it from our HS, pausing between fetches based on a distribution of user think times. Over the course of an hour, we logged the usage of IP and RP circuits from both the hidden server and the five clients. This experiment was repeated more than 20 times over two months before analyzing the results.

Additionally, to gather client-side traffic from live hidden services, we deployed our five clients to access real Tor HSs instead of our deployed HS. To compare the usage of general circuits with IP and RP circuits, we also ran clients accessing general (non-hidden) websites using Alexa’s top 1,000 URLs [1]. From these experiments, we generated cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the Duration of Activity (DoA), the number of outgoing and incoming cells, as shown in Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c.

**Observations:**
- **IP Circuits (HS-IP)**: These circuits are long-lived, with a DoA of around 3,600 seconds (one hour), which aligns with the duration of each experiment. This ensures continuous reachability of the HS through its IP. HS-IP circuits have exactly 3 outgoing cells (2 extend cells and 1 establish intro cell) and a varying number of incoming cells, depending on the number of clients connecting to them. Entry guards can potentially identify an OP acting on behalf of an HS by observing long-lived connections with only 3 initial cells sent.
- **Client-IP Circuits**: These circuits have an equal number of incoming and outgoing cells, typically 4 each. The OP sends 3 extend and 1 introduce1 cells, and receives 3 extended and 1 introduce ack cells. Client-IP circuits are short-lived, with a median DoA of around 1 second and 80% having a DoA of 10 seconds or less.
- **Active RP Circuits**: These circuits have a median DoA of 600 seconds, which is the expected lifetime of a Tor circuit. Clients accessing our HS reused the same RP circuit to fetch different pages. However, when accessing live Tor hidden services, the DoA is significantly lower. General circuits tend to have a larger DoA than RP circuits because the same RP circuit is not used to access more than one hidden domain.
- **HS-RP Circuits**: These circuits have more outgoing cells than incoming cells, which is expected as they correspond to the fetching of web pages. Typically, the client sends requests, and the server sends larger objects. RP circuits do not multiplex streams for different hidden domains, resulting in fewer total cells compared to active general circuits.

### Summary

Our experiments provide insights into the behavior and characteristics of different types of circuits in the Tor network, particularly in the context of hidden services. The findings highlight the unique properties and lifetimes of HS-IP, Client-IP, and HS-RP circuits, and their distinct roles in facilitating secure and anonymous communication.
