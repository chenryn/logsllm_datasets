• HS-IP: This is the circuit established between the
Hidden Service (HS) and its Introduction Point (IP).
The purpose of this circuit is to listen for incoming
client connections. This circuit corresponds to ar-
row 1 in Figure 2.
• Client-RP: This is the circuit that a client builds to
a randomly chosen Rendezvous Point (RP) to even-
tually receive a connection from the HS after he has
expressed interest in establishing a communication
through the creation of a Client-IP circuit. This cir-
cuit corresponds to arrow 4 in Figure 2.
• Client-IP: This is the circuit that a client interested
in connecting to a HS builds to one of the IPs of
the HS to inform the service of its interest in wait-
ing for a connection on its RP circuit. This circuit
corresponds to arrow 5 in Figure 2.
• HS-RP: This is the circuit that the HS builds to the
RP OR chosen by the client to establish the commu-
nication with the interested client. Both this circuit
and the Client-RP connect the HS and the client to-
gether over Tor. This circuit corresponds to arrow 6
in Figure 2.
For our hidden service experiments, we used more
than 1000 hidden services
that are compiled in
ahmia.fi [2], an open source search engine for Tor hid-
den service websites. We base our observations on the
logs we obtained after running all experiments for a three
month period from January to March, 2015. This is im-
portant in order to realistically model steady-state Tor
processes, since Tor’s circuit building decisions are in-
ﬂuenced by the circuit build time distributions. Further-
more, we conﬁgured our Tor clients so that they do not

By doing so, we increase variety in our data collection,
and do not limit ourselves to observations that are only
obtained by using a handful of entry guards.
3.1 Multiplexing Experiment
To understand how stream multiplexing works for
Client-RP and Client-IP circuits, we deployed a single
Tor process on a local machine which is used by two
applications: firefox and wget. Both automate hid-
den services browsing by picking a random .onion do-
main from our list of hidden services described above.
While the firefox application paused between fetches
to model user think times [19], the wget application ac-
cessed pages sequentially without pausing to model a
more aggressive use. Note that the distribution of user
think times we used has a median of 13 seconds, and a
long tail that ranges between 152 to 3656 seconds for
10% of user think times. Since both applications are us-
ing the same Tor process, our intention is to understand
how Tor multiplexes streams trying to access different
.onion domains. We logged for every .onion incom-
ing stream, the circuit on which it is attached. We next
describe our observations.
Streams for different .onion domains are not multi-
plexed in the same circuit. When the Tor process re-
ceives a stream to connect to a .onion domain, it checks
if it already has an existing RP circuit connected to it. If
it does, it attaches the stream to the same circuit. If not,
it will build a new RP circuit. We veriﬁed this by exam-
ining a 7-hour log from the experiment described above.
We found that around 560 RP circuits were created, and
each was used to connect to a different.onion domain.
Tor does not use IP or RP circuits for general
streams. Tor assigns different purposes to circuits when
they are established. For streams accessing non-hidden
servers, they use general purpose circuits. These circuits
can carry multiple logical connections; i.e., Tor multi-
plexes multiple non-hidden service streams into one cir-
cuit. On the other hand, streams accessing a .onion
domain are assigned to circuits that have a rendezvous-
related purpose, which differ from general circuits. We
veriﬁed the behavior through our experiments, and also
by reviewing Tor’s speciﬁcation and the source code.
3.2 Hidden Service Trafﬁc Experiment
The goal of this experiment is to understand the usage of
IP and RP circuits from the hidden server and from the
client points of view. We deployed a hidden service on
the live Tor network through which a client could visit a
cached version of any hidden service from our list above,
which we had previously crawled and downloaded. Our
hidden service was simultaneously accessed by our ﬁve
separate Tor instances, four of which use wget, while
one uses firefox. Every client chooses a random page
from our list of previously crawled hidden pages and re-
quests it from our HS. Again, all clients pause between
fetches for a duration that is drawn from a distribution of
user think times. During the whole hour, we logged the
usage of the IP and RP circuits observed from our hidden
server, and we logged the RP and IP circuits from our 5
clients. We ran this experiment more than 20 times over
two months before analyzing the results.
In addition, to get client-side trafﬁc from live hid-
den services, we also deployed our ﬁve clients described
above to access our list of real Tor HSs, rather than our
deployed HS.
Similarly, to understand the usage of general circuits,
and to compare their usage to IP, and RP circuits, we
also ran clients as described above, with the exception
that the clients accessed general (non-hidden) websites
using Alexa’s top 1000 URL [1]. From our experiments,
we generated the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the DoA, the number of outgoing and incoming cells,
which are shown in Figure 5a, 5b, and 5c. We present
our observations below.
IP circuits are unique. Figure 5a shows the CDF of
the DoA for different circuit types. Interestingly, we ob-
serve that IP circuits from the hidden service side (i.e.,
HS-IP) are long lived compared to other circuit types.
We observe that the DoA of IP circuits showed an age of
around 3600 seconds (i.e., an hour), which happens to be
the duration of each experiment. This seems quite logi-
cal as these have to be long living connections to ensure
a continuous reachability of the HS through its IP. An-
other unique aspect of the hidden services’ IP circuits,
shown in Figure 5b, was that they had exactly 3 outgo-
ing cells (coming from the HS): 2 extend cells and one
establish intro cell. The number of incoming cells
(from the IP to the HS) differ however, depending on
how many clients connect to them. Intuitively, one un-
derstands that any entry guard could, possibly, identify
an OP acting on behalf of an HS by seeing that this OP
establishes with him long-lived connections in which it
only sends 3 cells at the very beginning. Furthermore,
from the number of incoming client cells, an entry guard
can also evaluate the popularity of that HS.
Client-IP circuits are also unique because they have
the same number of incoming and outgoing cells. This
is evidenced by the identical distributions of the num-
ber of incoming and outgoing cells shown in Figures 5b
and 5c. For most cases, they had 4 outgoing and 4 incom-
ing cells. The OP sends 3 extend and 1 introduce1
cells, and receives 3 extended and 1 introduce ack
cells. Some conditions, such as RP failure, occasionally

resulted in more exchanged cells, but IP circuits still had
the same number of incoming and outgoing cells. An-
other unique feature was that, contrary to the HS-IP cir-
cuits, the Client-IP circuits are very short lived – their
median DoA is around a second, as shown in Figure 5a,
and around 80% of Client-IP circuits have a DoA that is
less than or equal to 10 seconds. We expect this behavior
as Client-IP circuits are not used at all once the connec-
tion to the service is established.
Active RP circuits, like general circuits, had a median
DoA of 600 seconds, which is the expected lifetime of
a Tor circuit. This was in particular observed with the
clients which accessed our HS (the same RP circuit is
reused to fetch different previously crawled pages). On
the other hand, when the clients access live Tor hidden
services, they have signiﬁcantly lower DoA. Indeed, we
observe (Figure 5a) that general circuits tend to have a
larger DoA than RP circuits. The reason for this is that
the same RP circuit is not used to access more than one
hidden domain. Once the access is over, the circuit is not
used again. On the other hand, general circuits can be
used to access multiple general domains as long as they
have not been used for more than 600 seconds.
HS-RP circuits have more outgoing cells than incom-
ing cells. This is quite normal and expected since that
circuit corresponds to the fetching of web pages on a
server by a client. Typically, the client sends a few re-
quests for each object to be retrieved in the page whereas
the server sends the objects themselves which are nor-
mally much larger than the requests. There can be ex-
ceptions to this observation when, for instance, the client
is uploading documents on the server or writing a blog,
among other reasons.
Similarly, because RP circuits do not multiplex
streams for different hidden domains, they are also ex-
pected to have a smaller number of outgoing and incom-
ing cells throughout their DoA compared to active gen-
eral circuits. As can be seen in Figures 5b, and 5c, one
may distinguish between Client-RP and HS-RP circuits
by observing the total number of incoming and outgo-
ing cells. (Note that, as expected, the incoming distribu-
tions for the client and for the hidden service RP circuits
from Figure 5c are the same as the outgoing distribution
for hidden service and client RP, respectively, from Fig-
ure 5b.)
The incoming and outgoing distributions of RP cir-
cuits are based on fetching a hidden page, so the distribu-
tions we see in the ﬁgures might represent baseline dis-
tributions, and in the real network, they may have more
incoming and outgoing cells based on users’ activity. Al-
though the exact distributions of the total number of in-
coming and outgoing cells for RP circuits is based on
our models and may not reﬂect the models of users on
the live network, we believe that the general trends are
