I would like to have/add types for at least some of the `@babel/*` packages
but before I start creating PR(s), I want to get other peoples opinions.
`@babel/core` in its current state can be just an alias to/copy of `babel-
core` for now. Can I just do something like this or do I need to copy/paste
it?
    // @babel/core
    export * from "babel-core";
The version of `babel-types` on NPM is `6` but the version mentioned in the
types is `7`. The version of `@babel/types` is `7` so what's going on here?
Also `@babel/core` types will depend on `@babel/types` types or should I just
import `babel-types`?
I am not really sure on how to move forward so I like to get some thoughts on
this.
