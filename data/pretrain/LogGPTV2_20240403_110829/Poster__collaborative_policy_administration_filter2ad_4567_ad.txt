Mr. Knudsens project addressed a specific government 
requirement: The selection of a branch code which 
is the statistical industry category to which a newly 
registered business will belong. However, the DBA 
knew that many business owners become frustrated 
and spend undue amounts of time figuring out which 
code to choose. To many of them, selecting a code is 
not merely a question of statistical categorization, 
it is making a choice about their businesses’ public 
identity. Around a fourth of all new businesses in 
Denmark end up registering a code that does not 
accurately match what their business does; this leads 
to error in the government systems: Because the 
Food Safety Administration, the Ministry of Taxation, 
the Work Safety Agency, and others, use the codes to 
plan and execute controls (including on-site visits) 
to businesses, the knock-on effects on administrative 
waste and error are huge.
Sune Knudsen engaged designers to use a range 
of ethnographic techniques to study how business 
owners experienced the online registration, and 
how various public agencies internally dealt and 
collaborated around the branch codes. Building on 
insights about user experience outside and inside 
the system, designers then carried out iterative 
prototyping of web mock ups, testing them with end 
users. The team, consisting of public servants on Mr. 
Knudsens own staff; a digital design agency; and 
the innovation unit MindLab, then created a working 
model for a new 
website to handle 
branch code 
registration, 
as well as a 
knowledge 
management 
system for 
administrative 
staff, to ensure 
xv
quick knowledge-sharing across the different public 
agencies.
6.2. Public value by design
Sune Knudsens comments above highlight a pattern 
in a number of the instances that are part of the 
empirical research: That the solutions flowing from 
design-led approaches, when implemented, hold 
a potential for significant improvements in public 
value. According to Cole & Parston, “public value”24 is 
increased when public service organizations are able 
improve efficiency (productivity) while at the same 
time improving outcomes. In my own work I argue that 
in addition to productivity and outcomes, the value 
of innovation in the public sector should also include 
user (citizen) satisfaction and democratic elements 
such as participation, empowerment, transparency, and 
accountability.25 In fact, the engagement of citizens 
might in itself lead to increased value. As Pestoff points 
out, governments can seek better ways of involving 
their citizens in the provision (co-production) of goods 
and services, either for reasons of improving efficiency 
of public services, effectiveness of public policies, or to 
promote other important social goals, such as citizen 
empowerment, participation and democracy.26
What kinds of public value are potentially improved 
by design approaches? Taking a closer look at the 
quote by Sune Knudsen above, he expects that his 
design project will make the branch code registration 
easier and more satisfactory for business owners, 
ensure better outcomes in the form of more accurate 
registration (compliance) with the codes, and he 
expects that the public administrators will save time 
answering questions about the codes and will have 
fewer errors in planning and executing controls. An 
externally produced business case study of the project 
confirmed that these types of value could be expected, 
to the extent that the cost of the new web-based 
solution would deliver a saving in time and money 
for both businesses and the public administration to 
the tune of approximately a one to twenty return on 
investment (ROI) over three years27.
Going back to the case of Camillagaarden, the 
institution for adult mentally handicapped, manager 
Christina Pawsø similarly noted an actualized gain in 
productivity which flowed from the changes in the 
24  Cole & Parston, 2006

26  Pestoff, 2012
27  MindLab, 2012
xvi
relationship with citizens. Not only has the institution 
added thirty percent more users while maintaining 
the same number of staff, and increased satisfaction. 
She also gives the example that on average there is 
one social worker to eight users at Camillagaarden. 
However, with the right type of engagement of the 
users, a staff of two can easily facilitate thirty users 
over several hours at a time. That is approximately 
a doubling of productivity. Pawsø explains how this 
is made possible by leveraging the resources and 
motivation of the individual user: “If you are put into a 
frame where all your resources are being used instead 
of everything you are having trouble with, then you 
can also help others. And this also gives value to the 
individual.”
The British organisation The Innovation Unit has 
characterized such results, where services are 
produced at lower cost while being better for people 
and driving more positive outcomes, as “radical 
efficiencies”.28 It seems that co-design helps managers 
realise exactly such opportunities. 
7. CONCLUSION: DISCOVERING CO-PRODUCTION BY 
DESIGN
In each of the cases discussed in this article, 
collaborative design processes seems to have 
triggered new and different approaches by public 
managers to their organization’s service provision. 
Below I consider the implications for design practice, 
education and for public policy.
28  Gillinson, Sarah et. al: Radical efficiency, NESTA, 2010
IMPLICATIONS FOR
DESIGN PRACTICE
Design approaches – as applied in the examples I give in this article – help public 
managers explore in detail how the system/user relationship is shaped very 
concretely via interactions in space and time. This holds a disruptive potential 
because public managers are given the opportunity to view the results of their 
organization’s efforts in a new light. There is a rather systematic finding across the 
empirical data – all sixteen interviews – that the voice of the citizen, however it is 
captured through audio or video (but preferably by such ‘live’ media), is a crucial 
trigger for change. It can be termed ‘professional empathy’, because qualitative 
research seems to power an empathetic, engaging, but still professional, (re)
connection between public service staff and users. As Anne Lind, Director of the 
Danish Board of Industrial Injuries (BII) said, “it is an eye-opener”. 
What is especially eye-opening is how user experiences are tightly connected to the 
very creation of outcomes. In an institution for adult mentally handicapped such as 
Camillagaarden, where engagement and thriving is the desired outcome, positive 
user experience and a co-productive relationship with staff is the key to positive 
change. Getting businesses to comply with abstract statistical requirements requires 
that the Danish Business Authority establishes an interaction design that makes 
doing the right thing easy. And to help injured workers back to the labor market 
requires that the Board of Industrial Injuries designs a meaningful, individualized 
service process that builds and nourishes people’s physical and mental healing and 
identity to the point where they can re-boot, re-train and re-enter the world of work. 
The implication for design practice is that designers must continue to develop and 
strengthen their ability to conduct in-depth user research and to facilitate processes 
with clients and stakeholders to activate their “professional empathy” and help turn 
the eye-openers into real change.
DESIGN EDUCATION
Design approaches provide a different set of tools and ways of working 
systematically and collaboratively with innovation in government. Qualitative, 
ethnographically-inspired research; highly open, interactive and tangible workshop 
formats; visualization and rapid prototyping; user testing redesigned services; these 
are in many ways novel approaches to policy and service innovation.
Design education needs to support students in learning the theory and practice 
of collaborative design within a public sector setting. Further, education must 
equip them with the ability to navigate the internal machinery of government. 
Even as designers help public managers achieve an outside-in perspective on 
the consequences of their efforts, designers must also appreciate the inside-out 
experience of working within a political, hierarchical and bureaucratic setting. 
Extended secondments or internships to public service organizations is probably the 
best way of helping design students really appreciate what the daily life of a public 
servant is like; but additionally it could make sense to equip design students with 
a minimum of public management theory, perhaps as electives. One of the biggest 
xvii
barriers for designers to become trusted advisers of governments is simply that their 
world, or world-view, is too far removed than the one of policy makers. For future 
generations of designers to be effective, that needs to change.
POLICYMAKING
This article pointed to three implications for policy. Firstly, A new relationship with 
citizens implies a new mode of production which shifts the relationship between 
the public service system and citizens. The concept points towards a much more 
reciprocal, mutual relationship where the professional public staff sees its role as a 
collaborative one, and where citizens are recognized as co-producers of value. 
Secondly, a shift to outcomes via citizen-centred (ethnographic) research shows the 
consequences for people of an organisation’s interactions with them. The concept 
relates to the new system/citizen relationship, but takes it a step further via methods 
which show, often in highly empathetic ways, what kind of impact a service or 
process is having on end-users.
More public value could, thirdly, be generated both for system and for users, as a 
result of working systematically with redesigning interactions to shape the new 
relationship. 
These three findings point to a conclusion: That design-led innovation can lead 
to the discovery and implementation of co-production as a new model for public 
service organizations. This model however poses new challenges to existing 
practices, routines and cultures:
New professional identities for public service staff: How to make the transition from 
‘helper’ to ‘facilitator’?
If co-production leads to a need for fewer human resources in public organizations, 
would design projects with this focus mean asking staff to make themselves 
redundant? How can they then be expected to engage in making co-production 
successful?
Will users want to co-produce? Although the findings point to a positive shift in 
the system/citizen relationship, is there such a thing as too much reciprocity? Will 
citizens revolt and demand that they just ‘receive’ service for their tax dollars? 
It may be that design has not only helped place co-production back on the public 
sector reform agenda; it may trigger a renewed research agenda around these topics 
as well.

ABSTRACT
This article collects a set of emerging themes for design research and action. The themes are lessons learned 
from case studies and research projects in Helsinki, Finland that deal with peer production of public services. 
We argue that these themes are relevant for the design and building of resilient and sustainable public and 
collaborative services in the next decades.

1.  INTRODUCTION
The thoughts we present in here as our contribution to 
the Public & Collaborative cluster activities have their 
most concrete origins on a meta-level initiative we 
have been running since 2010 here at Aalto University 
in the form of a “special interest group” or SIG. Our 
CO-P2P SIG was a cross-Aalto activity that aimed at 
understanding processes, logics and incentives that 
make possible novel partnerships between the public 
sector, private sector, third sector, and citizens, in order 
to create, produce and deliver public services. Instead 
of focusing on a particular design intervention; the 
participants in the SIG decided to focus their efforts 
on creating shared vocabulary and analysis of past and 
ongoing initiatives of the members of the SIG, since 
we noticed we needed to build common ground and 
a set of shared premises if we were to continue work 
further. Thus through a seminar and case studies we 
design a shared outcome in the form of a book (see 
Figure 1), much in the same spirit as we are now doing 
this exercise at the DESIS level. 
In this chapter we want to highlight some of the 
thoughts and experiences that writing the book 
brought to us in relationship to the aims and 
questions we have been tackling in the DESIS cluster 
of Public & Collaborative. We do this here with the 
aim of bringing the relationship to design activities 
more to the fore-front.
2 PUBLIC & COLLABORATIVE, A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF 
THE SITUATION IN FINLAND
In Finland, like it has been the case in other western 
countries, the last few years have witnessed a flurry 
of citizen-driven and organized activities that range 
from guerrilla gardening and urban farming with aims 
to beautify unattended urban spots1, pop up one day 
restaurant initiatives2 that comment on impractical 
bureaucracy, Cleaning day carnivals3 that call attention 
to the need for new recycling practices, grassroots 
urban planning initiatives and new movements to

 A successful case is a nationwide network of urban gardening 
coordinated by Dodo ry an environmental association (http://www.
kaupunkiviljely.fi)
 The Ravintolapäivä (http://www.restaurantday.org/) has turned into 
an international movement called “restaurant day” where everyone 
can create a restaurant for a day.
