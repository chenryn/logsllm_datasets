pus. As with all such systems, the resulting rule-based parser is
fragile and is unlikely to generalize well outside the data it was de-
veloped for, but its purpose is to efﬁciently establish a large set of
known results against which our own work can be benchmarked.
For completeness, we describe its design here.
As with our statistical parser, our rule-based parser divides each
record into line-granularity tokens. The underlying assumption,
validated by our experience, is that each line encodes at most one
“kind” of information. We then identify common separators (i.e.,
colons, spaces, tabs, etc.) that might separate any given line into
“title: value” pairs (e.g., a line starting with “Registrant Name:”
indicates that the text immediately following the colon is the name
of the registrant). As well, we capture the common case where this
relation is contextual and a ﬁeld title appears alone with the fol-
lowing block representing the associated value (e.g., a line starting
with “Registrant” might then be followed by a name, address,
e-mail address and phone number). Upon this framework, we have
added a large number of special case rules, iterating repeatedly un-
til our rule-based parser was able to completely label the entries in
our test corpus.
5. EVALUATION
In this section we evaluate the accuracy of the model described
in Section 3. We also compare the performance of rule-based and
statistical parsers that have been constructed from the same (possi-
bly limited) set of manually labeled WHOIS records within the com
domain. It is important to realize that these parsers can correctly la-
bel all the records that were used to construct them. Thus we must
devise more careful ways to compare them.
We use both types of parsers to label the ﬁelds of WHOIS records
as registrar, domain, date, registrant, other, or null. Then, we seek
to answer three questions. First, which type of parser—rule-based
or statistical—generalizes better to new WHOIS records in the same
TLD? Second, how well do these parsers generalize (if at all) to
WHOIS records in different TLDs? Third, when these parsers fail—
presumably because they encounter WHOIS records with unfamiliar
templates—how much effort is required to correct these failures?
We explore each question in turn.
9Roughly 7.5% of domains we queries resulted in a failure after all
3 attempts.

5.1 Comparison on .com
We investigate the ﬁrst question, using ﬁve-fold cross-validation,
on our data set of 86K labeled WHOIS records from the com do-
main. We randomly split this data set into ﬁve folds of roughly 17K
records each. Within each fold we further subsample the records
to obtain smaller training sets of 20, 100, 1000, and 10000 WHOIS
records. Finally, we use these training sets to construct rule-based
and statistical parsers, then evaluate these (purposely handicapped)
parsers on the test set of the remaining WHOIS records (roughly
68K) in other folds. Thus for each training set size, we obtain ﬁve
estimates of the test error, and we measure the mean and standard
deviation of these estimates.
The goal of these experiments is to understand which type of
parser generalizes better to new WHOIS records. To construct the
statistical parsers in these experiments, we merely limit the WHOIS
records that are used to estimate their model parameters. Likewise,
to construct the rule-based parsers, we simply “roll back" our best
rule-based parser, retaining only those rules that are necessary to

label the WHOIS records in these smaller subsets. Note, however,
that some pattern-matching rules cannot be rolled back, so the rule-
based parser that we derive in this way is always stronger than one
derived from “scratch" on the smaller subsets of WHOIS records.
Figures 2 and 3 compare the performances of the rule-based and
statistical parsers in these experiments. We measure the perfor-
mance by two types of error rates on the test set:
the line error
rate, equal to the fraction of lines across all WHOIS records that are
mislabeled, and the document error rate, equal to the fraction of
records that are not perfectly labeled (i.e., in which there is at least
one incorrectly labeled line). The ﬁgures show, not surprisingly,
that both types of parsers improve with broader exposure to WHOIS
records in com. However, comparing the rule-based and statistical
parsers, we see that the latter dominate the former, especially when
limited numbers of WHOIS records are available as labeled exam-
ples. These results suggest that the statistical parsers are learning
to detect patterns of text in WHOIS records that are of broader ap-
plicability than those manually identiﬁed by the rule-based parsers.
Indeed, with only 100 labeled records the statistical parser reaches
an accuracy of over 97%, and with 1000 it reaches over 99%.
5.2 Comparison on new TLDs
We also compare the rule-based and statistical parsers on WHOIS
records from new, unseen TLDs outside of com. It turns out that
each of these new TLDs is owned by a single registrar, and that
the WHOIS records within each TLD follow a consistent template.
However, these templates are not necessarily ones that have been
observed in the training set of WHOIS records from the com domain.
Table 2 compares the number of lines mislabeled by each type
of parser on these new TLDs. In these comparisons, it is enough to
sample one WHOIS record from each TLD because the formatting
within each TLD is identical. There is no case in which the rule-
based parser performs better than the statistical one, and there are
many cases (asia, biz, coop, travel, us) in which it performs
far worse. Again these results suggest that the statistical parser has
discovered patterns of wider applicability than the rule-based one.
5.3 Comparison of maintainability
Finally we consider which type of parser is easier to maintain
in an actual deployment. There are two issues here: ﬁrst, how
many errors are encountered when the parser is exposed to WHOIS
records in different formats than it has already experienced; second,
how much effort is required to ﬁx these errors going forward?
