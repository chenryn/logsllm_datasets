User: How to protect SSH service from brute force attack on Linux system? Please provide an SSH security solution based on fail2ban.
Assistant: SSH service is a common remote connection protocol on Linux systems, but because it is vulnerable to brute force attacks, we need to take some measures to protect SSH services. The following is an SSH security solution based on fail2ban. 1. Install fail2ban Installing fail2ban on a Linux system is very simple, you can use the following command: ```sh sudo apt-get install fail2ban ``` 2. Configure fail2ban After successfully installing fail2ban, we need to configure it to improve SSH Security of the Service. There is a configuration file named jail.conf in the /etc/fail2ban directory, which contains the default configuration options for fail2ban. We can use an editor such as vi to open the file, and then refer to the following configuration information to modify: ```sh [ssh] enabled = true port = ssh filter = sshd logpath = /var/log/auth.log maxretry = 3 banaction = iptables-multiport bantime = 3600 ``` The meanings of the above configuration information are as follows: - enabled: enable ssh rules - port: listening port number, the default is 22 - filter: the matching log file filtering rule is sshd, ie /var/log /auth.log - maxretry: the maximum number of attempts, exceeding this number will trigger a ban - banaction: trigger the ban mechanism, iptables-multiport is used by default - bantime: ban time, in seconds, the default is 3600 seconds 3. Restart fail2ban to modify the configuration After file, we need to use the following command to restart the fail2ban service to make it take effect: ```sh sudo service fail2ban restart ``` 4. Routine maintenance The above configuration information is just the basic configuration of fail2ban, we also need to maintain fail2ban routinely to improve the SSH service security. The specific maintenance steps are as follows: - Regularly clear the ban list of fail2ban to prevent legitimate users from being banned by mistake - Regularly update the security patches of the system and SSH service - Follow the best practices of security management, strengthen password strength, restrict login IP, etc. In short, as long as we take With proper security measures in place, SSH services can be protected from brute force attacks.
