Figure 11: Characterization of the active IPv4 address
space: Spatio-temporal activity, trafﬁc contribution, rel-
ative host count per /24.
7.1 Internet-wide Demographics
Figure 11 shows a 3D-visualization of our feature ma-
trix, where we indicate the number of /24 address blocks
falling into each bin by scaling the size of the respective
sphere. We can make several observations from this plot: (i)
We see a strong division of address blocks along the spatio-
temporal utilization axis. While one set of blocks is clus-
tered towards values with a very small spatio-temporal uti-
lization (less than 0.2), another set is clustered towards very
high spatio-temporal utilization. Recalling Section 5, this
can mainly be attributed to varying addressing mechanisms.
(ii) Taking the trafﬁc contribution into account, we see that
densely utilized address blocks typically have a higher traf-
ﬁc volume. However, this observation is not always true;
we also see signiﬁcant portions of the address space with
high trafﬁc volume in sparsely-populated areas. (iii) When
relating these two features to our host count measure, we
again see a higher host count for highly-utilized and trafﬁc-
intensive blocks. In particular, we see only a very tiny por-
tion of /24 blocks that fall into the highest bin for the host
count metric. These blocks typically also show a maximum
spatio-temporal utilization and maximum trafﬁc contribu-
tion (small spheres at the top-right). It is important to notice
that blocks contained in these small spheres are responsible
for a signiﬁcant share of the CDN’s overall trafﬁc.
7.2 Regional Characteristics
Lastly, we dissect the address space by regional registries.
Recall that the address space is subject to management from
5 different organizations (RIRs, Section 2). Each RIR ap-
plies different management policies and the current state of
address exhaustion also varies per RIR. Thus, we believe that
this grouping can assist in understanding the current status of
density, the median of the 1st/5th/10th bin corresponds to
2/2K/500K unique sampled User-Agents strings.
the address space in each of these regions and support pol-
icy decisions when it comes to managing the last remaining
blocks and re-allocations of address blocks already in use.
Figure 12 shows an address space categorization for the ﬁve
RIRs. Here, we plot the spatio-temporal utilization and traf-
ﬁc contribution on the x and y axes, and indicate the relative
host counts by the color scale (gray: low relative host count,
red: high relative host count). Again, we adjust the size of
the circles to reﬂect the number of /24s falling into each bin.
We can see that about half of the active address space
within the ARIN region clusters towards the left, i.e., shows
low utilization, low trafﬁc contribution. However, we note
that there are some heavily active address blocks also in this
region (small red dots at x = 0.2 / y = 0.8,0.9). We see that the
other regions have more of their address space being highly-
utilized, which is especially true for LACNIC and AFRINIC.
A possible explanation for this behavior is that LACNIC and
AFRINIC were incorporated much later than the other RIRs
and had address conservation as a primary goal from the very
beginning [31]. Noticeably for the APNIC and AFRINIC re-
gions, we see a signiﬁcant chunk of /24 blocks towards the
top-right of the ﬁgures (x = 1.0, y = 0.8), which also show
a very high relative host count. This hints towards increased
proxying/gateway deployments which is more pronounced
in these regions when compared to, e.g., ARIN.
IMPLICATIONS

Implications to measurement practice: We count 1.2 bil-
lion active, globally-unique IPv4 addresses, more than has
been reported previously, except by statistical estimation [37],
boding well for future use of such statistical models and
techniques driven by sampled observation. Our address count
analysis implies that remote active measurements are insuf-
ﬁcient for census or complete survey of the Internet, partic-
ularly at IP address-level granularity. Also, our passive mea-
surements have shown extensive churn in IPv4 addresses on
all timescales, which implies that any census needs to be
qualiﬁed by the observation frequency and period.
Implications to Internet Governance: The 1.2 billion ac-
tive addresses we count represent 42.8% of the possible uni-
cast addresses that we see advertised in the global routing ta-
ble. If we restrict our implications to the 6.5 million /24 pre-
ﬁxes in which we observed active WWW clients addresses
(Table 1), i.e., exclude blocks that may be dedicated to net-
work infrastructure and services, we see that roughly 450
million address may have been unused. If some large subset
actually are unused, today, one could imagine reallocating
them for use in IPv6 transition mechanisms that require IPv4
addresses, e.g., NAT64 and DNS64 [5, 6], or as a commod-
ity whose supply might last years in a marketplace, based on
past rates of growth in IPv4 address use (Figure 1).
IPv4 address markets are an operational reality, governed
by the respective RIR policies [31]. A pertinent implication
of our work for these markets is that our metrics, combined
with the appropriate vantage points, are ideal to readily de-
termine spatio-temporal utilization of network blocks. This
can aid RIRs in determining the current state of address uti-

lization in their respective regions, in determining if a trans-
fer conforms with their transfer policy (e.g., four of ﬁve RIRs
require market transfer recipients to justify need for address
space), as well as in identifying likely candidate buyers and
sellers of addresses.
Implications to network management: It is feasible for
any network to employ our metrics and perform our anal-
ysis on a continual basis, e.g., by monitoring trafﬁc at its
border. Measuring spatio-temporal utilization would enable
an operator to more efﬁciently manage the IPv4 addresses
they assign, especially in networks such as those discussed
in Section 6. Networks that make gains in efﬁciency by dis-
covering unnecessary address blocks may decide to become
sellers in the IPv4 transfer marketplace. More generally, we
believe that our measurements can serve as input for fruitful
discussions on address assignment practices and their even-
tual effect on address space utilization.
Implications to network security: Our observations of many,
disparate rates of change in the assignment of IP addresses
to users has consequences for maintaining host-based access
controls and host reputations. A host’s IP address is often
associated with a reputation subsequently used for network
abuse mitigation, e.g., in the form of access control lists and
application rate-limits that speciﬁcally use those IP network
blocks or addresses as identiﬁers with which some level of
trust is (or is not) associated. Unfortunately, in this way, ad-
dresses and the network blocks become encumbered by their
prior uses and the behavior of users within. This happens
when reputation information is stale. The implication of our
work here is that it can inform host-based access control and
host reputation, e.g., by determining the spatial and temporal
bounds beyond which an IP addresses reputation should no
longer be respected. Further, our change detection method
(Section 5.2) could be used to trigger expiration of host rep-
utation, avoiding security vulnerabilities when networks are
renumbered or repurposed.
Implications to content delivery: Details about user ac-
tivity at the address level are valuable in CDN operation.
A key responsibility of CDNs is to map users to the ap-
propriate server(s) based on criteria including performance
and cost [26]. Details about active IP addresses and network
blocks are increasingly important when the CDN uses end-
user mapping [9], where client addresses are mapped to the
appropriate server.
9. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the Internet through the lens of
IPv4 address-level activity as measured by successful con-
nections to a large CDN. After many years of constant growth,
active IPv4 address counts have stagnated, while IPv6 counts
have grown [28]. In addition, we observe churn in the set
of active addresses on time scales ranging from a day to a
year. Simple address counts do not capture the increasingly
complex situation of usage of the IPv4 address space. In-
stead, we use three metrics that our results show are helpful
to understand what is happening now: spatio-temporal as-
pects of address activity, address-associated trafﬁc volume,
and relative host counts. Continued overall growth but lag-
ging adoption of IPv6 have brought a reimagined IPv4 upon
us, one that entails increased address sharing in both space
and time. The Internet community is in a complex and costly
resource-limited predicament, foreseen but unavoided. The
prolonged tussle continues amongst operators about whether
and when to implement incremental changes to IPv4, adopt
IPv6, or both. Our study, as well as others that might adopt
our metrics, can guide us in this tussle and better illuminate
the condition of the IPv4 address space.
