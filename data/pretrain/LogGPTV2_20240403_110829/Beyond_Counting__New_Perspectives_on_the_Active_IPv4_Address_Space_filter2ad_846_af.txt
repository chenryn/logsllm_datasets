# Spatio-Temporal Utilization and Traffic Contribution

## 7.1 Internet-wide Demographics

**Figure 11** presents a 3D visualization of our feature matrix, where the size of each sphere represents the number of /24 address blocks in that bin. Several key observations can be made from this plot:

1. **Spatio-temporal Utilization:**
   - There is a clear division of address blocks along the spatio-temporal utilization axis. One set of blocks clusters towards very low utilization (less than 0.2), while another set clusters towards very high utilization. This dichotomy can largely be attributed to different addressing mechanisms, as discussed in Section 5.

2. **Traffic Contribution:**
   - Densely utilized address blocks generally have higher traffic volumes. However, there are significant portions of the address space with high traffic volume in sparsely populated areas, indicating that high traffic is not always correlated with high utilization.

3. **Relative Host Count:**
   - Highly utilized and traffic-intensive blocks tend to have a higher host count. A very small portion of /24 blocks fall into the highest bin for the host count metric, typically showing maximum spatio-temporal utilization and maximum traffic contribution (represented by small spheres at the top-right). These blocks are responsible for a significant share of the CDN's overall traffic.

## 7.2 Regional Characteristics

We further dissect the address space by regional registries. The address space is managed by five different organizations (RIRs, as detailed in Section 2). Each RIR has different management policies, and the state of address exhaustion varies among them. This grouping helps in understanding the current status of the address space in each region and supports policy decisions for managing the remaining blocks and reallocating existing ones.

**Figure 12** categorizes the address space for the five RIRs, plotting spatio-temporal utilization and traffic contribution on the x and y axes, and using color to indicate relative host counts (gray: low, red: high). The size of the circles reflects the number of /24s in each bin.

- **ARIN Region:**
  - About half of the active address space in the ARIN region shows low utilization and low traffic contribution. However, there are some highly active address blocks (small red dots at x = 0.2 / y = 0.8, 0.9).

- **Other Regions:**
  - Other regions, particularly LACNIC and AFRINIC, have more of their address space being highly utilized. This can be attributed to LACNIC and AFRINIC having address conservation as a primary goal from the beginning [31]. For APNIC and AFRINIC, a significant number of /24 blocks are at the top-right of the figures (x = 1.0, y = 0.8), indicating very high relative host counts. This suggests increased proxying/gateway deployments, which are more pronounced in these regions compared to, for example, ARIN.

## Implications

### 8.1 Implications for Measurement Practice
- We counted 1.2 billion active, globally-unique IPv4 addresses, more than previously reported except by statistical estimation [37]. This bodes well for the future use of such statistical models and techniques driven by sampled observation.
- Our address count analysis implies that remote active measurements are insufficient for a complete census or survey of the Internet, especially at the IP address level. Additionally, our passive measurements show extensive churn in IPv4 addresses across all timescales, indicating that any census needs to be qualified by the observation frequency and period.

### 8.2 Implications for Internet Governance
- The 1.2 billion active addresses represent 42.8% of the possible unicast addresses advertised in the global routing table. If we focus on the 6.5 million /24 prefixes with active WWW client addresses (Table 1), excluding blocks dedicated to network infrastructure and services, roughly 450 million addresses may be unused. If a large subset is indeed unused, they could be reallocated for IPv6 transition mechanisms like NAT64 and DNS64 [5, 6] or as a commodity in the IPv4 address market.
- IPv4 address markets are an operational reality, governed by RIR policies [31]. Our metrics, combined with appropriate vantage points, can help determine the spatio-temporal utilization of network blocks, aiding RIRs in assessing the current state of address utilization and identifying potential buyers and sellers.

### 8.3 Implications for Network Management
- Any network can employ our metrics and perform continuous analysis, such as monitoring traffic at its border. Measuring spatio-temporal utilization would enable operators to manage IPv4 addresses more efficiently, especially in networks discussed in Section 6. Networks that discover unnecessary address blocks may decide to sell them in the IPv4 transfer marketplace. Our measurements can also inform discussions on address assignment practices and their impact on address space utilization.

### 8.4 Implications for Network Security
- Our observations of disparate rates of change in IP address assignments have implications for maintaining host-based access controls and reputations. IP addresses are often associated with reputations used for network abuse mitigation. Stale reputation information can lead to security vulnerabilities. Our work can inform host-based access control and host reputation, determining the spatial and temporal bounds beyond which an IP address's reputation should no longer be respected. Our change detection method (Section 5.2) can trigger the expiration of host reputations, avoiding security issues when networks are renumbered or repurposed.

### 8.5 Implications for Content Delivery
- Details about user activity at the address level are valuable for CDN operations. CDNs map users to appropriate servers based on performance and cost [26]. Information about active IP addresses and network blocks is increasingly important for end-user mapping, where client addresses are mapped to the appropriate server.

## 9. Conclusion

In this paper, we study the Internet through the lens of IPv4 address-level activity, as measured by successful connections to a large CDN. After years of constant growth, active IPv4 address counts have stagnated, while IPv6 counts have grown [28]. We observe churn in the set of active addresses on time scales ranging from a day to a year. Simple address counts do not capture the complex usage of the IPv4 address space. Instead, we use three metrics—spatio-temporal aspects of address activity, address-associated traffic volume, and relative host counts—to understand the current situation. Continued overall growth but lagging adoption of IPv6 have brought a reimagined IPv4, entailing increased address sharing in both space and time. The Internet community faces a complex and costly resource-limited predicament, foreseen but unavoidable. The prolonged tussle continues among operators about whether and when to implement incremental changes to IPv4, adopt IPv6, or both. Our study, along with others adopting our metrics, can guide us in this tussle and better illuminate the condition of the IPv4 address space.
