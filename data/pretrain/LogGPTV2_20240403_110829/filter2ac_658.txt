**Description:**
HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a security measure designed to mitigate Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attacks. In such attacks, an adversary may use a mis-issued or fraudulent certificate to intercept and decrypt encrypted communications. HPKP enforces the use of a specific, expected certificate, thereby preventing the use of unauthorized certificates and enhancing the security of the communication channel.
