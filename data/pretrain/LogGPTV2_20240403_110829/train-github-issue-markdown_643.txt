Flow now has better support for React. We should upgrade the `with-flow`
example to use the new version of flow.
Also, I don't know much about adding flow type support to libraries, but it
doesn't seem like Next JS has flow types built in... would this be something
worth adding?
  * [ x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
In `examples/with-flow/components/layout.js`, we can change the children prop
to be a required property, and change the value to React.Node. There are
likely other changes that could be made - we can run flow-upgrade as described
here to see what changes need to be made.
## Current Behavior
`with-flow` example uses old flow version.
