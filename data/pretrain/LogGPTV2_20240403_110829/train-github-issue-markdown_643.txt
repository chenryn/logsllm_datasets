### Enhanced Support for React in Flow

Flow now offers enhanced support for React, and we should update the `with-flow` example to utilize the latest version of Flow. Additionally, I'm not very familiar with incorporating Flow type support into libraries, but it seems that Next.js does not currently include built-in Flow types. Would it be beneficial to add this feature?

- [x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior

In the file `examples/with-flow/components/layout.js`, we can modify the `children` prop to be a required property and set its type to `React.Node`. There may be other necessary changes as well. We can run the `flow-upgrade` tool as described in the documentation to identify all required modifications.

## Current Behavior

The `with-flow` example currently uses an older version of Flow.
