the respondent). Second, mobile nodes often have limited 
processor  and  battery  capacity  while  an  attacker 
pretending  to  be  a  mobile  is  likely  to  have  much  more 
computational resources.  The puzzle protocols work well 
only when all clients have approximately equal processing 
power.  Therefore,  we  have  decided  against  using  puzzle 
protocols in our design.

exceeded,  communication  needs  to  be  prioritized.  For 
example, a MIPv6 node that exceeds the limit should stop 
sending or accepting BUs and allow binding cache entries 
to  expire.  Although  communication  can  continue  via  the 
mobile's home network, it is suboptimal. The node should 
try  to  aggressively  resume  normal  operation  when  it 
believes that the attack may be over.

6.3. Favoring Regular Customers 
The  correspondent's  local  security  policy  can  be 
defined to allow BUs with some high-priority mobiles or 
those with which it has a long-term relationship or recent 
meaningful communication. The decision could be based 
on state information from upper protocol layers but this is 
problematic to implement. In some common situations, it 
may  be  worthwhile  to  violate  the  layering  principle.  For 
example, a Web server could accept BUs from its clients 
after it has successfully executed the TCP handshake. The 
mobile  may  similarly  favor  selected  correspondent 
addresses,  e.g.  ones  with  which  the  mobile  user  has 
explicitly initiated communication. 
It may also help to keep updating the existing entries in 
the  Binding  Cache  so  that  existing  optimized  routes  can 
be  maintained  during  a  DoS  attack,  although  it  is  not 
certain that the existing cache entries belong to the  most 
important  mobiles  or  even  to  authentic  ones.  Some 
indication of this may be inferred from the packet counts 
associated with the traffic flowing through each entry.

Sometimes  this  can  be  achieved  by  rearranging  the 
messages but it might be necessary to add new messages 
and to pad existing ones with dummy data. The question 
that  needs  to  be  decided  is  whether  the  cost  of  these 
protections  is  more  acceptable  than  the  threat  created  by 
the reflection and a small constant factor of amplification.  
Figure  2(c)  shows  the  final  version  of  our  BU-
authentication  protocol  with  one  additional  message  to 
balance  the  message  flows.  Note  that  the  correspondent 
can  still  be  still  stateless  because  it  responds  to  message 
1a  with  2a  and  to  message  1b  with  2b  but  in  no  way 
associates 
to  each  other.  The 
exchanges are parallel so that the total time taken by the 
protocol  is  not  significantly  increased.  (i  and  j  are  the 
indices  needed  for  making  the  correspondent  stateless.) 
The  mobile,  on  the  other  hand,  needs  to  receive  both 
messages 2a and 2b before sending the authenticated BU.

7. The Right Level of Protection 
We conclude this paper by discussing  the criteria that 
should  be  used  for  selecting  and  comparing  BU 
authentication  protocols  and  the  issues  that  arise  when 
there are several alternative protocols. 
7.1. Prioritizing the Goals 
It is essential to implement any protection mechanism 
if security of other nodes or communication between other 
nodes  depends  on  it.  Therefore,  preventing  the  bombing 
attacks against third parties (Section 4.1) should have the 
highest  priority  when  designing  a  secure 
location 
management protocol. In practice, this means making the 
return routability test (Section 4.2) mandatory. When only 
the  node's  own  security  and  availability  depends  on  a 
countermeasure, it is possible to leave the decision to each 
node. This is the case with most other resource-exhaustion 
attacks (Section 5) and, in fact, with the authentication of 
BU origin (Section 3). It is, however, important to realize 
that if a server node does not require an adequate level of 
authentication  from  its  clients,  the  service  may  become 
unusable under attack.  
In MIPv6, the binding updates are an optimization and 
a node can always protect itself and others by not sending 
BUs  or  by 
received  ones.  This  means 
communicating  always  via  the  mobile's  home  network. 
This  strategy  can  be  followed  when  simplicity  of 
implementation is the primary goal. 
ignoring 
7.2. Multiple Levels of Authentication 
The  computational  and  communicational  capabilities 
of Internet nodes vary vastly, as does the level of security 
they  require.  It  would,  therefore,  be  desirable  to  have  a 
range  of  authentication  protocols  with  different  cost  and 
security  trade-offs.  For  example,  closed  high-security 
groups  could  use  pre-established  shared  keys  or  a  PKI, 
most  nodes  CGA  authentication  with  return  routability 
tests  for  DoS  prevention,  and  low-end  mobile  devices  a 
protocol based only on RR. However, care must be taken 
to  accommodate  the  multiple  levels  of  protection  so  that 
the attacker cannot bid down to the lowest level.  
is  made  by 
the  correspondent.  Therefore, 
In  MIPv6,  the  decision  about  accepting  or  rejecting  a 
BU 
the 
correspondent  will  always  make  the  final  decision  about 
the  required  level  of  authentication  for  a  particular 
mobile.  It  makes  little  sense  for  the  correspondent  to 
allow  multiple  levels  of  authentication  for  the  same 
mobile node because the attacker could always tackle the 
weakest  one.  Thus,  the  mobile  must  either  authenticate 
itself  using  the  protocol  chosen  by  the  correspondent  or 
give  up  binding  updates.  Protocol  negotiation 
is 
counterproductive  unless  the  mobile's  choices  can  be 
strongly authenticated.  
A technique similar to CGA  addresses can be used to 
express the mobile's choice. The idea is to hash the list of 
acceptable protocols together with the mobile's public key 
and  routing  prefix  when  forming  the  interface  identifier 
(i.e.  the  second  half  of  the  IP  address).  An  alternative 
proposal  is  to  reserve  type  bits  in  the  IP  address  to 
indicate  whether 
is  cryptographically 
generated  or  of  some  other  type.  Both  techniques  are 
based  on  the  observation  that  if  the  mobile's  choice  of 
protocol  is  encoded  into  the  IP  address,  the  attacker 
cannot interfere with it. 
the  address 
It  is  worth  noting  that  as  long  as  bombing  of  third 
parties  is  prevented,  different  correspondents  can  make 
their choice of authentication strength independently. This 
is  because  a  weak  mechanism  accepted  by  one 
correspondent will not help the attacker to redirect packets 
to  or  from  correspondents  that  use  a  stronger  protocol. 
The  correspondent  can  also  have  a  local  policy  that 
mandates  a  stronger  (e.g.  shared  key  authentication  or 
PKI)  or  weaker  (e.g.  plain  RR)  of  authentication  for  a 
particular home address or range of addresses.  
There  is,  however,  the  risk  that  business  reasons  will 
force practically all IP nodes to use the  weakest  level of 
authentication  that  is  mandatory  to  implement  and  use. 
For  example,  if  many  low-end  mobiles  only  implement 
the  weakest 
all 
correspondents  will  default  to  this  mechanism,  which 
would defeat the purpose of having any stronger protocol.

(Section 4.1) has been ignored in many Internet protocols 
that  update  location  or  routing  information.  We  also 
suggested  and  analyzed  mechanisms  for  protecting  the 
protocol participants and third parties. The ideas presented 
in  this  paper  formed  the  basis  for  the  development  of  a 
secure  location  management  protocol  for  Mobile  IPv6, 
which uses only symmetric cryptography and follows the 
lines of  Figure  2(c). We hope that this  work  will help to 
secure other Internet mobility protocols as well.
