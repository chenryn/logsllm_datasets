## Layer 2 Protocols
### Overview
- **ARP**: Address Resolution Protocol
- **CDP**: Cisco Discovery Protocol
- **VLAN**: Virtual LAN
- **STP**: Spanning Tree Protocol
- **DTP/VTP**: Dynamic, VLAN Trunking Protocol
- **Addressing and Traffic**: Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast

---

## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
### Functionality
- Prevents loops in the Ethernet network topology
- Redundant data paths are forced into a standby (blocked) state
- Enabled on all ports by default
- No traffic forwarding during STP processing

### States
- Boot-up initialization
- Blocking state
- Listening state
- Disabled state
- Forwarding state
- Learning state

### Root Switch Election
- **Step 1**: Root Switch Election
- **Step 2**: STP processing blocks redundant paths

### Network Traffic Interception
- Requires physical connection to two switches
- Allows for transparent traffic interception

### Other STP Attacks
- CAM table poisoning
- DoS: Force infinite election, Ephemeral Root
- Difficult to track down network topology

### Security Measures
- Monitor which equipment is the root bridge
- Filter MAC addresses and add static IP-to-MAC mappings
- Activate BPDU-guard (Bridge PDU) to filter STP
- Limit broadcast traffic

```plaintext
! MLS in hybrid mode (Sup w/ CatOS, MSFC w/ IOS)
set spantree disable
set spantree portfast bpdu-guard-enable

! MLS in native mode (CatIOS on the Sup and MSFC)
spanning-tree portfast bpduguard
set port security enable 01-02-03-04-05-06 shutdown
set port broadcast 0.01%
```

## Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
### Overview
- Proprietary to Cisco
- Works on any HDLC capable link/device
- Multicast traffic
- Leaks information: device ID/name, network address, port ID, capabilities, software version, platform, and IP network prefix

### Message Format
- Details of the message format

### Security Measures
- **Router**:
  - Global deactivation: `no cdp run`
  - Per interface deactivation: `interface xy`, `no cdp enable`

- **Switch**:
  - Global/per interface deactivation: `set cdp disable`

## VLANs: Layer 2 Partitioning
### Issues with VLANs
- Not designed for security but used to enforce it
- (Multi-layer) switches become single points of security failure
- Avoid using the (native) VLAN 1
- Do not use VMPS (VLAN Management Policy Server)

### VLAN Jumping/Hopping
- Possible if you use DTP or if a port is in the same VLAN as the trunk’s port Native VLAN (inject 802.1q frames)
- VLAN bridges allow bridging between VLANs for non-routed protocols

### Private VLAN (6k, 4k) and Port Protection (29xx, 35xx)
- Port isolation
- Devices in the same VLAN cannot talk directly to each other

```plaintext
set vlan 2
clear trunk 1
```

---

## VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
### Overview
- Enables central VLAN configuration (Master/Client)
- Message format: like CDP (SNAP HDLC 0x2003)
- Communicates only over trunk ports

### Attacks
- Add/remove VLANs
- Create STP loops

### Security Measures
- Put switches in transparent VTP mode and use a password

```plaintext
set vtp domain <password>
set vtp mode transparent
```

---

## Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
### Overview
- Enables automatic port/trunk configuration
- Message format: like CDP (SNAP HDLC 0x2004)
- All switch ports are in auto mode by default

### Attacks
- 802.1q frames injection
- VLAN hopping

### Security Measures
- Turn DTP off on all ports

```plaintext
set trunk off all
```

---

## Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP)/Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
### HSRP
- Provides next-hop redundancy (RFC2281)
- Information disclosure: virtual MAC address (00-00-0c-07-ac-)
- By default, the HSRP virtual interface does not send ICMP redirects
- More than 2 routers can be in a standby group; becoming the master is enough

### VRRP
- Supports MD5 for authentication (IP Authentication Header)

### Security Measures
- Use password authentication
- Change the virtual MAC address
- Use IPsec (Cisco recommendation), though it is not trivial (multicast traffic, order of processing depending on IOS release, limited to a group of 2 routers)

```plaintext
interface xy
standby 10 priority 200 preempt
standby 10 authentication p4ssw0rd
standby 10 ip x.x.x.x
standby 10 mac-address
```

---

## Debugging and Monitoring
### On Routers
- **Local Output**:
  - Debug with ACLs
  - Always use the buffer and do not debug to the console
  - Performance impact: check the router’s load with `sh proc cpu`

- **Remote Device**:
  - Use a GRE tunnel to a remote host and inject the traffic back from there (tunnelx)

```plaintext
access-list 100 …
debug ip packet detail 100
logging buffered 64000 debugging
{tcpdump,snoop}ing on routers
```

### On Switches
- **No Local Output**
- **Remote Device**:
  - Mirror ports or a VLAN to another port
  - Can copy only designated traffic to be inspected (VACL with “capture” keyword)
  - RSPAN dumps the traffic to a VLAN (needs end-to-end Cat6K)
  - 1 or 2 SPAN port(s) depending on the switch
  - Performance impact close to zero: check the CPU load with `ps -c` (hidden command)

```plaintext
! MLS in hybrid mode
set span
! MLS in native mode
monitor session ...
set security acl capture-ports
{tcpdump,snoop}ing on switches
```

## Configuration Basics
### General
- Turn off all unneeded services
- Use syslog
- Use (authenticated) NTP

```plaintext
no ip bootp server
no tcp-small-servers
no udp-small-servers
service time log datetime localtime show-timezone msec
service time debug datetime localtime show-timezone msec
logging x.x.x.x
logging trap debugging
logging source loopback0
logging buffered 64000 debugging
ntp authentication-key 10 md5
ntp authenticate
ntp trusted-key 10
ntp server x.x.x.x [key 10]
ntp access-group peer 20
access-list 20 permit host x.x.x.x
access-list 20 deny any
no service finger
no service pad
no ip http server
no ip source-route
no cdp run
no boot network
no service config
no ip subnet-zero
no ip identd
no ip finger
service nagle
```

### Interface Level
- Disable unnecessary features
- Use loopbacks whenever possible

```plaintext
interface xy
no ip source-route
no ip directed-broadcast
no ip proxy-arp
no ip redirects
no ip unreachables
ip accounting access-violations
no ip mask-reply
no cdp enable
interface xy
ip multicast boundary 10
access-list 10 deny 224.0.1.39
access-list 10 deny 224.0.1.40
interface loopback0
ip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.255
```

## Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
### Versions
- **v1**: RFC1157 uses community strings for authentication
- **v2**: RFC1441/1446 adds security (party) and get-bulk
- **v3**: RFC2274 adds integrity checking, encryption, and user authentication

### Known Attacks/Problems
- Admins use RW communities for management
- Weak communities
- Replay and DoS attacks
- Information leak
- Auto-discovery feature of management tools that “send” your community out of your network range (to external parties)

### Security Measures
- **IP Level Filtering**:
  - Define an ACL and activate it on a per interface basis

```plaintext
interface Ethernet0/0
access-group in 100
access-list 100 permit udp host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.1.2 eq snmp
access-list 100 permit udp host 192.168.1.2 eq snmp host 192.168.1.1
access-list 100 deny udp any any eq snmp log-input
snmp-server community r3ad view cutdown RO 10
snmp-server community wr1te RW 10
snmp-server view cutdown ip.21 excluded
snmp-server enable traps
snmp-server host x.x.x.x
snmp-server source loopback0
access-list 10 permit x.x.x.x
```
