Hello everyone,

I frequently use Bootstrap for my projects and have encountered a few challenges recently. Currently, I am developing a dashboard for a client that requires the display of a significant amount of information, utilizing the full screen. To achieve a responsive design, I am using the `col-xs`, `col-sm`, `col-md`, and `col-lg` classes. This approach works well, except for a specific issue: some items on the dashboard become too wide when the screen resolution exceeds 1500-1600 pixels.

To address this, I am considering creating a custom `col-xlg` class for my application. However, I am unsure if other developers face similar issues and whether it is necessary to implement such a feature, especially as display sizes continue to increase.

I would appreciate any insights or feedback you may have.

Thank you in advance.
