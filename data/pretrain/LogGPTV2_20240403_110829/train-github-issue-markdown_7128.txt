Hi everybody. I use so much bootstrap that I have few problems at few moments.
In this moment, I work on a dashboard for my client. I use all of my screen
because I have many informations to show. So, I use col-xs, col-sm, col-md and
col-lg for a responsive design. It's awesome except that my dashboard own few
items which are too fat when my screen is superior at 1500/1600px.
I would can develop a new custom col-xlg class for my app but I don't know if
other people have this problem.
In the future, our displays will be most large and I ask me if that it's
necessary to develope a feature like this.
Thanks for your response.
