cant interest in performing research on mmWave communications.
However, much of the past work focuses on applications that re-
quire very high-data rate link, while having substantial energy and
computing power. For example, the systems presented in [17, 23]
utilize mmWave technology in data centers to enable high through-
put links between server racks. There is also work in using mmWave
for 5G applications [20, 36, 37]. Finally, some other systems use
mmWave to enable high data rate for VR application to stream
high-data rate videos from PC to VR headset [3, 4, 18]. In contrast,
mmX focuses on designing a mmWave network for low-power,
low-cost IoT devices. Unfortunately, such IoT devices cannot use
existing mmWave radios and protocols, due to their complexity,
cost and power consumption.
mmWave Radio Platforms: In the past few years, a variety of
mmWave radio platforms have been proposed by academia and in-
dustry. However, these platforms are very costly and power hungry
which makes them unsuitable for IoT applications. For example,
National Instrument mmWave system costs $134K and consumes
more than 20 watts [1, 2]. Similarly, OpenMilli and Mira costs a
few thousand dollars and consumes several watts [5, 47]. The main
reason for the high cost and high power of these platforms is that

(b) Line-of-sight is blocked

vices need to search for the best path to AP, and align their beams
toward it to establish a communication link.
they target applications which require very high-data rate links
(Gbps). Hence, they are not suitable for low-power, low-cost IoT
devices. In contrast, mmX’s radio platform targets low-power, low
cost applications, and since it has a very simple architecture, it
provides lower cost and lower power consumption than existing
mmWave platforms. In Section 10, we compare mmX with existing
mmWave platforms in terms of cost, power consumption, bitrate,
range, carrier frequency, and energy efficiency.
mmWave Beam Alignment: There is a large literature on
mmWave beam search and alignment [26, 44, 46]. Much of the

work proposed beam searching algorithms that are not fast enough
to enable mobile applications since they exhaustively search for
the best beam alignment [21, 41]. Some previous work leverages
sparse recovery algorithms (such as compressive sensing and Sparse
Fourier transform) to speed up the search for the best beam align-
ment [6, 19, 24, 40]. However, existing beam searching techniques
require expensive and lossy phased arrays with multiple phase
sifters and amplifiers to steer the beam. Unfortunately, phased ar-
rays are expensive to build and have high power consumption,
which makes them unsuitable for IoT applications. Further, ex-
isting beam searching techniques are either complex or require
feedback from the access point, and as a result, significantly in-
crease the power consumption and computation requirement of the
node. In contrast, mmX introduces a new modulation technique
that eliminates the need for beam searching, enabling IoT device
to communicate to the AP without searching for the best beam
alignment.
4 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
mmX is a mmWave wireless network for low-cost, low-power IoT
devices. It enables IoT devices to communicate using mmWave
spectrum, without placing any strains on today’s WiFi and LTE
spectrum. Figure 1 shows mmX’s setup, where multiple IoT nodes
transmit data to a single receiver, which we refer to as the Access
Point (AP). mmX operates in two phases: initialization and trans-
mission. In the initialization phase, the AP allocates channels to IoT
nodes. The bandwidth of an allocated channel depends on the data
rate requirement of the IoT node. For example, if a device needs to
stream an HD video, a few MHz of bandwidth must be allocated to
it. In the transmission phase, the nodes send their data to the AP.
Due to the directional property of mmWave communication, mmX
performs a spatial reuse of the spectrum to make the spectrum
usage more efficient. This allows multiple nodes to communicate to
an AP, simultaneously, without creating any interference for other
devices.
Over the next few sections, we will discuss the components that
contribute to the design of mmX. We start by explaining the two key
challenges in using mmWave technology for low-power, low-cost
IoT devices, and how we overcome them. Then, we explain how
mmX supports multiple nodes and enables them to communicate
to a single access point, simultaneously.
5 COST AND ENERGY CHALLENGE
To overcome the high cost and energy inefficiency of existing
mmWave radios, we introduce a new mmWave radio architec-
ture. Specifically, our design utilizes joint ASK-FSK modulation
to minimize the number of costly and power hungry mmWave com-
ponents while providing robust communication links. ASK-FSK
modulation combines two simple modulations: Amplitude-shift
keying (ASK) and Frequency-shift keying (FSK). ASK modulation
represents digital data as variations in the amplitude of a carrier
sine wave. Specifically, it transmits a sine wave with high amplitude
to present symbol ’1’ and transmits a sine wave with low amplitude
to present symbol ’0’. FSK modulation represents digital data as
variations in the carrier frequency.

(b) mmX’s AP
Figure 3: The block diagram of the mmX’s node and mmX’s
AP. The architecture of mmX’s node is very simple, making it ideal
for low-power, low-cost IoT devices
Due to their simplicity, these modulation schemes offer a simple,
low-power architecture. Traditional wireless systems avoid using
ASK or FSK modulation because of their low spectral efficiency.
This is mainly due to the fact that traditional wireless systems use
omni-directional antennas and any inefficiency of a node in spec-
trum usage will impact other users too. As a result, these systems
avoid using these simple modulations. However, since mmWave
systems use directional antennas, these systems can perform spa-
tial reuse of the spectrum. This will allow mmWave systems to use
the spectrum much more efficiently and hence the low spectral
efficiency of FSK or ASK modulation will not impact other users.
This is the reason why these modulations are also used in optical
and laser communication which are directional [45]. In the follow-
ing subsections, we explain how these modulations enable simple
architecture for mmX’s IoT node and access points.
5.1 mmX’s IoT Node
The block diagram of the mmX’s node is shown in Figure 3 (a),
which includes a mmWave section and a digital controller. The
digital controller (i.e., a micro-controller) is used to control param-
eters of the mmWave section and to generate the data stream. The
mmWave section includes only two active mmWave components:

a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and a Single Pole Double
Throw (SPDT) switch. The VCO generates a carrier signal (i.e., a
sine wave) at the desired carrier frequency, and feeds it to the SPDT.
The SPDT switches the signal between the two antenna arrays.
Both the SPDT and the VCO are controlled by the digital controller.
The device can choose different channels by changing the center
frequency of the VCO. It can also change the data rate by changing
the switching speed of the SPDT. Finally, the output of the SPDT is
fed to an antenna array, which can create beams to different direc-
tions. Instead of using a phased array to create and steer a beam,
we design an antenna array that can create beams toward different
directions without using any costly phased shifters. In Section 6.2,
we will explain our antenna design in more detail. The architecture
of the mmX’s node is very simple and low-power. Hence, it can be
incorporated into low-power, low-cost IoT nodes.
5.2 mmX’s Access Point
Figure 3 (b) shows the block diagram of the mmX’s AP, which
includes two main blocks: a mmWave down-converter and a base-
band processor. The down-converter first amplifies the received
mmWave signal with a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA). The LNA is
placed at the first stage to reduce the total noise figure of the re-
ceiver. To reduce the possible interference from the out of band
sources, the output of the LNA is fed to a filter. To avoid using
costly filters, mmX exploits a microstrip coupled line filter, which
is designed on the PCB board without any additional components.
After amplification and filtering, the mixer multiplies the signal
with a sine wave, generated by a local oscillator (LO). The LO signal
is generated using a Phased lock loop (PLL). An PLL operating at
mmWave frequency is costly and power hungry. Subsequently, we
use a sub-harmonic mixer, which itself doubles the LO frequency.
As a result, mmX uses a low-cost PLL operating at a much lower
frequency. Finally, the output of the mixer is fed to a baseband
processor to digitize and decode the down-converted signal. The
AP architecture is simple and low-cost. This architecture can be
used for a myriad of applications, including smart home hubs, au-
tonomous cars and much more.
6 BEAM SEARCHING CHALLENGE
As explained in Section 2, mmWave radios use directional antennas
to focus their power, and they need to search for the best direction
of the beam. In today’s radios, the beam steering is implemented
using phased arrays. Phased arrays are an array of antennas, each
with a phase shifter that controls the phase of the signal on the
antenna. By modifying the phase of the signal, mmWave radios
can create and steer a beam electronically. This will allow them to
search for the best direction to direct their beam toward.
Unfortunately, phased arrays are costly and power hungry which
makes them unsuitable for low-power IoT devices. A phased array
with even a small number of antennas (8 elements 6) consumes more
than a watt and costs a few hundred dollars [5, 8, 11]. In addition,
existing beam searching protocols are too complex for low power
IoT applications. First, when these protocols are searching, they
need multiple feedbacks from the AP, which significantly increases
the power consumption of the nodes, and second, regular mobility
6Each element of phased array requires one LNA/PA and one Phase shifter
and environmental changes means that the beam must perform
a continuous search, which is time-consuming and increases the
power consumption of an IoT device. Therefore, we need to design
a technique that enables IoT devices to communicate to an AP,
without using any phased array and beam searching mechanism.
One naïve approach is to use an antenna array with a fixed beam,
and then ask the user to point the device towards the access point.
Unfortunately, in this scenario, when the line-of-sight path gets
blocked, the signal will be completely lost and the device will not
be able to communicate with the access point. Another approach
is to have an antenna array that can create multiple fix beams
toward different directions, and pick the one which provides the
highest SNR at the AP. However, this approach requires the access
point to provide the IoT device feedback on which beam to pick.
Moreover, due to mobility and environmental change, the AP needs
to provide continuous feedback, which significantly increases the
power consumption of the node and its complexity. Ideally, we want
to employ a technique that enables an IoT device to communicate to
an AP without requiring costly phased arrays and avoids the need
for beam searching techniques. For the remainder of this section, we
introduce our technique, named Over The Air Modulation (OTAM),
which effectively addresses this problem.
6.1 Over The Air Modulation (OTAM)
As described in Section 5, mmX’s nodes use Amplitude-shift Keying
(ASK) modulation to communicate to the AP. Due to its simplicity,
this modulation scheme offers a simple, low-power architecture
suitable for IoT applications. However, to be able to communicate,
the node needs to search for the best beam direction. To avoid the
complexity of phased arrays and beam searching algorithms, while
providing a robust wireless communication link, we propose a new
architecture and modulation technique called Over The Air Modu-
lation (OTAM). OTAM exploits the high attenuation property and
directionality requirement of mmWave communication to create
ASK modulation over the air, and as a result, does not need to search
for the best beam direction.
Figure 4 illustrate how OTAM works. Our OTAM technique
integrates the beam selection into data modulation. Specifically,
instead of first creating an ASK signal and then choosing the best
beam direction to transmit, OTAM sends a sine wave (carrier signal)
to different beams depending on the value of data. For example,
when the data bit is "1", Beam 1 (blue) is selected and when the
data bit is "0", Beam 0 (red) is selected. Depending on the value
of the data, the carrier signal is either transmitted using Beam
1 or Beam 0. Due to the directionality and channel property of
mmWave communication, each transmitted signal will experience
a different path loss, thus the AP will receive a sine wave in which
its amplitude is modulated by the channel.
To understand why this approach does not require beam search-
ing and works even with mobility and time-varying environments,
let’s consider two different scenarios, as shown in Figure 4: 1) when
the line-of-sight (LoS) is clear, and 2) when the LoS is blocked.
Figure 4(a) shows the first scenario when there is no blockage in
the LoS path. In this example, the signal sent through Beam 1 expe-
riences much lower attenuation than the signal sent through Beam
0. This is because Beam 1 uses the direct path while Beam 0 relies

path and blockage are significantly different. In fact, past work has
