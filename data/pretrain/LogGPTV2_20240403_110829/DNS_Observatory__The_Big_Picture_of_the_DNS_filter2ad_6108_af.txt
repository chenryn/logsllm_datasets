DNS caching, TTLs, and resilience: several research works investi-
gated the relationship between TTLs and DNS caching. Given that
we monitor only the cache miss queries, TTLs play an important
role in our datasets. Jung et al. [41], using simulations based on
real traces, showed that longer TTLs improve caching, mostly for
domains with short TTLs (<1000s). In a subsequent study [40], Jung
et al. modeled DNS caches and were able to predict cache hit rates
from their previous study. Moura et al. [48] analyzed the relation-
ship between TTL and DNS resilience in face of DDoS attacks. In
2007 Pappas et al. proposed changes to caching strategies for NS
records to improve DNS resilience against DDoS attacks [52].
Query name minimization: RFC 7816 standardized query name
minimization (qmin) in 2016 [8]. A few years later, Vries et al. pre-
sented the first study focusing on qmin deployment [13]: with a
more local view on the DNS, they found about 40 % of all queries to
the .nl TLD and K-root nameservers being sent with qmin. However,
a more recent study by Huston [34] reported only 3 % deployment
of qmin, which is closer to our results in subsection 3.6.
7 CONCLUSION
We presented DNS Observatory, a novel stream analytics plat-
form that allows for unprecedented visibility into the DNS, and we
demonstrated some of its capabilities on real-world data.
DNS Observatory is based on passive measurements and collects
data from a large, diverse set of recursive resolvers spread around
the world, and run by many different operators. Using various
stream-oriented algorithms and probabilistic data structures, we
were able to ingest and process a total of 1.6 trillion DNS resolver-
nameserver transactions executed between January and April 2019.
We obtained a bird’s-eye view on the DNS, which allows for its
better understanding, and which suggests possible improvements.
The aggregated datasets collected in DNS Observatory are al-
ready available to academic researchers, by contacting the primary
author of this paper or through the Farsight Security Research Grant
99
program [19]. In a longer perspective, we also plan to make parts of
the collected data publicly available through a web interface, linked
under https://www.farsightsecurity.com/.
