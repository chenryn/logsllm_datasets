HORIZONTAL SCANNING RESULTS.
thirds of the 80/tcp live hosts are stable for over 2 months. The
others change due to servers being added and removed, and
IP assignments changing over time. This indicates that we can
trade coverage for politeness by reusing the results of a hor-
izontal scan for multiple application-layer scans. This slowly
decreases coverage over time, but minimizes the number of
horizontal scans needed.
The results show that the 80/tcp localized scans ﬁnd from
4.1% up to 57.5% of live hosts on the targeted ranges, well
above the 2.6% Internet average. This happens because most
seeds are located on cloud hosting providers, which are being
abused to install malicious servers. Thus, localized scans focus
on hosting services that house signiﬁcantly more web servers
than other residential or enterprise networks.
D. HTTP scanning
Table IV summarizes our HTTP scans, which probe the
set of live hosts found by the horizontal scans, identifying
malicious servers matching a ﬁngerprint. The left part of the
table shows the scan conﬁguration: the scan date, the target
port, the ﬁngerprint used, the number of hosts scanned, the
horizontal scan that found them (HID), and the number of
scanners used (SC). We have used CyberProbe to perform 22
scans using 14 ﬁngerprints. Note that we have yet to scan for
the remaining ﬁngerprints.
i.e.,
the response rate (Resp.),
The middle part of Table IV shows the results: the scan
duration;
the percentage of
targets that replied to the probe; the number of malicious
servers found; the number of malicious servers found previ-
ously known to us, i.e., seeds and servers found by a prior
scan for the same family; and the number of found servers
previously unknown. CyberProbe takes on average 14 hours
to perform an Internet-wide HTTP scan using 4 scanners and
24 hours using 3 scanners.
The results show that the 22 scans identiﬁed 194 servers,
of which 151 are unique. Starting from 15 seeds CyberProbe
identiﬁed 151 unique malicious servers, achieving a 10x am-
9
pliﬁcation factor. Of the 22 scans, 91% (20) ﬁnd previously
unknown malicious servers, the exception being two localized
scans for winwebsec and blackrev. The 11 localized scans
ﬁnd 66 servers (34 new), an average of 6 servers found per
scan. The 11 Internet-wide scans ﬁnd 128 servers (72 new),
an average of 11.6 servers found per scan. While Internet-
wide scans ﬁnd more servers per scan,
if we normalize
by the number of targets scanned, localized scans ﬁnd an
abnormally high number of malicious servers. This veriﬁes
our provider locality hypothesis: cybercriminals are installing
multiple servers on the same providers. Once they establish a
relationship with a hosting provider they are likely to reuse it,
minimizing the effort for locating new providers, learn their
procedure to install new servers, and create fake identities for
registration (e.g., Paypal accounts).
Coverage. The right part of Table IV shows the number of
servers found by CyberProbe that were already known to 4
popular anti-malware cloud services: VirusTotal (VT) [56],
URLQuery (UQ) [54], Malware Domain List (MD) [35],
and VxVault (VV) [58]. All these cloud services use crowd-
sourcing to collect potentially malicious executables and
URLs. Their coverage depends on the number and volume
of their contributors. Some of them have infrastructures to au-
tomatically visit submitted URLs (VirusTotal and URLQuery)
and execute the submitted malware to collect behavioral infor-
mation (VirusTotal). The collected information is dumped into
databases and public interfaces are provided to query them. As
far as we know, Malware Domain List and VxVault follow a
similar process to populate their databases from submissions,
but the process is manually performed by volunteers. We select
these speciﬁc databases because they are popular and allow
querying by IP address, while other public databases, e.g.,
Google Safe Browsing [47], only enable URL queries.
The best coverage is achieved by VirusTotal, which knows
25.7% of the servers found by CyberProbe (50/194), followed
by URL Query with 15.5% (30/194). Malware Domain List
