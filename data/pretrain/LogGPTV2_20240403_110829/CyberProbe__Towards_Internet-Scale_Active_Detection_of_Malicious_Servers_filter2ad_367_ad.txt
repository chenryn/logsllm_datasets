### Horizontal Scanning Results

Approximately two-thirds of the 80/tcp live hosts have been stable for over two months. The remaining one-third changes due to the addition and removal of servers, as well as changes in IP assignments over time. This suggests that we can trade coverage for politeness by reusing the results of a horizontal scan for multiple application-layer scans. While this approach gradually decreases coverage, it minimizes the number of required horizontal scans.

The results indicate that the 80/tcp localized scans identify between 4.1% and 57.5% of live hosts in targeted ranges, significantly higher than the 2.6% Internet average. This is because most seeds are located on cloud hosting providers, which are often abused to install malicious servers. Consequently, localized scans focus on hosting services that house a much higher concentration of web servers compared to residential or enterprise networks.

### HTTP Scanning

Table IV summarizes our HTTP scans, which probe the set of live hosts found by the horizontal scans to identify malicious servers matching specific fingerprints. The left part of the table details the scan configuration, including the scan date, target port, fingerprint used, number of hosts scanned, the horizontal scan that discovered them (HID), and the number of scanners used (SC). We conducted 22 scans using 14 different fingerprints with CyberProbe. Note that we have not yet scanned for the remaining fingerprints.

#### Scan Results

The middle part of Table IV presents the scan results, including:
- **Scan Duration**: The time taken to complete each scan.
- **Response Rate (Resp.)**: The percentage of targets that replied to the probe.
- **Malicious Servers Found**: The total number of malicious servers identified.
- **Previously Known Malicious Servers**: The number of servers already known to us, either as seeds or from previous scans for the same family.
- **Newly Discovered Malicious Servers**: The number of servers previously unknown.

CyberProbe takes an average of 14 hours to perform an Internet-wide HTTP scan using 4 scanners and 24 hours using 3 scanners.

The 22 scans identified 194 servers, of which 151 were unique. Starting from 15 seeds, CyberProbe identified 151 unique malicious servers, achieving a 10x amplification factor. Of the 22 scans, 91% (20) found previously unknown malicious servers, with the exceptions being two localized scans for winwebsec and blackrev. The 11 localized scans found 66 servers (34 new), averaging 6 servers per scan. The 11 Internet-wide scans found 128 servers (72 new), averaging 11.6 servers per scan. Although Internet-wide scans find more servers per scan, when normalized by the number of targets, localized scans reveal an abnormally high number of malicious servers. This supports our provider locality hypothesis: cybercriminals tend to install multiple servers on the same providers. Once they establish a relationship with a hosting provider, they are likely to reuse it, minimizing the effort required to locate new providers, learn their procedures for installing new servers, and create fake identities for registration (e.g., PayPal accounts).

### Coverage

The right part of Table IV shows the number of servers found by CyberProbe that were already known to four popular anti-malware cloud services: VirusTotal (VT), URLQuery (UQ), Malware Domain List (MD), and VxVault (VV). These cloud services use crowdsourcing to collect potentially malicious executables and URLs. Their coverage depends on the number and volume of contributors. Some, like VirusTotal and URLQuery, have infrastructures to automatically visit submitted URLs and execute the submitted malware to collect behavioral information. The collected data is then made available through public interfaces. Malware Domain List and VxVault follow a similar process, but it is manually performed by volunteers. We selected these databases because they are popular and allow querying by IP address, unlike other public databases such as Google Safe Browsing, which only enable URL queries.

VirusTotal achieved the best coverage, knowing 25.7% of the servers found by CyberProbe (50 out of 194), followed by URLQuery with 15.5% (30 out of 194). Malware Domain List and VxVault had lower coverage.
