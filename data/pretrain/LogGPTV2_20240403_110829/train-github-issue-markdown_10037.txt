 **Bug summary**
When plotting the attached time vs. masked arrays using `plot_date`,
`matplotlib` chooses a timespan of 4Â½ years despite the time axis covering
less than 4 days (I had to make it a zip or github would not permit it as an
attachment). This happens because most of the data in `y` is masked; the data
in the time-axis are not masked at all, so it should still be able to choose a
sensible time range.
**Code for reproduction**
    plot_date(t, x)
**Actual outcome**

**Expected outcome**
The expected span of time axes is obtained with
    plot_date(t.data, x.data)
