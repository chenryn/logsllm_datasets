I am unable to run Jupyter Notebook from the command line using the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

The error message I receive is:
```
'jupyter' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.
```

However, I can run Jupyter Notebook through PyCharm, though it has some issues. When I use the IP and port of the kernel provided by PyCharm and paste them into my browser, I can access the Jupyter Notebook interface.

I cannot use Anaconda due to a dependency on ArcPy. I have also explored the Jupyter files for any clues. I suspect that I need to add something to my system's PATH.

**Assistant:**
This is an older issue, but you can try running Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

```bash
python -m notebook
```

This was the only method that worked for me after installing Jupyter via `pip` on Windows 10. I did not modify the PATH.
