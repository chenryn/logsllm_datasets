Assistant: The following are the steps to solve the problem that the database cannot be started: 1. Check the error log of the database to see if there is any relevant error information. 2. Check the database configuration file to ensure that the settings in the configuration file are correct. It can be compared against the configuration files of other normally started databases. 3. Check the disk space of the database to ensure that there is enough space to store the data. 4. Check the permission setting of the database to ensure that the database user has sufficient permission to access the database file. 5. Restart the server and restart the database service. If none of the above steps can solve the problem, consider using the database repair tool to repair it, or reinstall the database. In addition, when solving problems, be sure to back up your data to avoid data loss.
