**ATT&CK ID:** T1430.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Impersonate SS7 Nodes

**Description:**
Adversaries may exploit the lack of authentication in signaling system network nodes to track the location of mobile devices by impersonating a node. This technique involves adversaries masquerading as legitimate nodes within the Signaling System 7 (SS7) network, which is used for telecommunication signaling. By doing so, they can intercept and manipulate signaling messages, enabling them to track the location of targeted mobile devices.
