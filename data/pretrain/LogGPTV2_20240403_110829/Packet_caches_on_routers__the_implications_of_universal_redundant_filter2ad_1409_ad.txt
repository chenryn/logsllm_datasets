### Improved Text

**Figure 6(b)**: This figure compares the mean improvements in network footprint reduction for SP-RE and RA across six different tier-1 ISP topologies. The mean improvement is calculated over all Points of Presence (PoPs) within an ISP. For SP-RE, the mean improvement ranges from 2% to 12%, while for RA, it ranges from 11% to 17%. Notably, in some cases, such as AS1668, which has a very sparse topology, the benefits of RA are marginal compared to SP-RE. In sparse networks, simple redundancy elimination is often sufficient to reduce the network footprint.

### Real Traces Analysis

Next, we analyze the benefits of RA and SP-RE using real packet traces. Our analysis is conducted on the network topology of SprintLink (AS1239). We vary the origin PoP of the packet trace and study the benefits of RA and SP-RE, assuming all packets in the trace are destined for SprintLink’s customers. To model where the intra-domain traffic would exit SprintLink’s network, we map the top 2500 destination prefixes in the traces to a US city using "undns" [23] and traceroute, and then map the city to the nearest SprintLink PoP. We assume each router has a 2GB packet store.

Our trace-based analysis is representative of a real-world application of redundancy elimination and redundancy-aware routing. Using the traces, we first compute the redundancy profiles (Section 3.3.2). Then, we compute redundancy-aware routes, route packets in the trace on the computed paths, and simulate redundancy elimination on each router (Section 2.1).

**Figure 7(a)**: This figure shows the distribution (CDF) of the improvement in network footprint when different PoPs in AS1239 are chosen as the ingress. The trace used here is from a high-volume /24 prefix with a redundancy proportion of nearly 50%. Both SP-RE and RA offer substantial reductions in network footprint. Specifically, the benefit from RA exceeds 40% for approximately 10% of the ingresses. One such ingress is Seattle; RA aggregates traffic originating from Seattle and destined for NYC, Boston, and Dallas (which receive 36% of the total traffic) together with traffic destined for Chicago (which receives 40% of the traffic), and routes all traffic on the single Seattle-Chicago link.

**Figure 7(b)**: This figure presents the results of a full packet trace of the University access link. The aggregate redundancy proportion in this trace was 17%. There is little difference between SP-RE and RA in this case, as shown in Figure 4(a), because a very small fraction of the content is duplicated across PoPs. Redundancy elimination, however, is generally very beneficial, resulting in a 10-20% reduction in the network footprint.

### Benefits in Intra-Domain Traffic Engineering (TE)

We also demonstrate that redundancy elimination and redundancy-awareness can help ISPs better meet their network-wide TE goals. For this analysis, we use synthetic traces and impose capacity constraints on network links. Given a Rocketfuel ISP topology, we annotate links with capacities chosen uniformly at random from {2.5, 10}Gbps.

We generate one synthetic trace per PoP in the ISP topology. For simplicity, the traffic from all PoPs has the same ρoverall and ρinter. However, each trace differs in the aggregate traffic volume, which is proportional to the population of the PoP’s location. Given the traffic proportions, we compute (redundancy-agnostic) routes that minimize the maximum link utilization in the network. We refer to this approach as SP-MaxLoad.

The aggregate volumes between PoPs in the network are then scaled up so that the maximum link utilization is 80%.

**Figure 8**: This figure shows the traffic engineering results with different redundancy profiles (ATT network). The baseline for comparison is SP-MaxLoad. The bars labeled “SP-RE” show the improvement in the maximum link utilization. Redundancy elimination can improve maximum link load when coupled with traditional traffic engineering, with improvements ranging from 1% when (ρoverall, ρinter) = (0.2, 1) to 25% when (ρoverall, ρinter) = (0.5, 0.5). The bars labeled “RA” show the benefits of employing redundancy-aware routes, with the maximum link load being 10%-37% lower. Such significant reductions in the maximum link utilization are extremely valuable to ISPs, as they create additional capacity within the network and allow them to meet service-level objectives more effectively.

### Sudden Traffic Variations

We also examine how our approaches can mitigate the impact of sudden spikes in traffic load, such as those that might occur during flash crowd events. We use the same setup as above for simulating the flash crowd: We start with a network-wide trace where we set ρoverall = 0.2 and ρinter = 0.5 for traffic from all ingresses. The traffic volumes are such that the maximum link utilization due to SP-MaxLoad is 50%.

Given this setup, we compute redundancy-aware network routes. We then make a sudden change—a factor of f increase overall—to the volume of traffic originating from an ingress picked at random. We also change the redundancy profile, i.e., ρoverall and ρinter, of the traffic from the ingress. However, we do not recompute new redundancy-aware routes; instead, we study how routes that match the stale profiles perform.

**Figure 9**: This figure shows the results from two different flash crowd simulations. In both cases, we increase ρoverall to 0.5. In the first case, the flash crowd causes a higher fraction of duplicate packets to be distributed across multiple destinations, with ρinter increasing from 0.5 to 0.75. The performance of the different schemes is shown in Figure 9(a). Redundancy elimination, whether coupled with redundancy-awareness or not, offers clear benefits in mitigating the impact of the sudden increase. When the traffic volume increases by f = 3.5X, the maximum link load due to SP-RE is 85%, and that due to RA is 75%. Without any form of redundancy elimination (SP-MaxLoad), the maximum load is 95%.

**Figure 10**: This figure illustrates the impact of stale redundancy profiles on the performance of different schemes. The figure shows the performance degradation over time as the redundancy profiles become outdated.
