##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.2
  * Operating System / Platform => Ubuntu 16.04
  * Compiler => ‚ùî
##### Detailed description
I'm using python bindings for opencv and found a bug with resizing images with
5 channels. It works fine for any other number of channels.  
I've also checked previous versions and it works in 4.1.1. So the bug should
be very recent
##### Steps to reproduce
    import numpy as np
    import cv2
    arr = np.ones((1200, 1200, 5), dtype=np.uint8)
    cv2.resize(arr, (512, 512))
for me it fails with  
`double free or corruption (!prev)`
