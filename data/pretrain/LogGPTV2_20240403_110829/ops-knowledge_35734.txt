User:  How to configure VRRP
Assistant: VRRP (Virtual Routing Redundancy Protocol) is a protocol for improving network reliability and redundancy. 1. Create a VRRP group: Select two or more routers in the network and form them into a VRRP group. This group has a virtual IP address and a priority which is used to decide which router will be the active router and which will be the backup router. 2. Configure routers: configure VRRP protocol on each router, and assign a unique VRRP group ID to each router. Each router also needs to configure the priority and virtual IP address of the VRRP group. The priority of a router determines whether it becomes an active router, and the virtual IP address is used to represent the address of the VRRP group. 3. Configure the detection mechanism: In the VRRP group, you need to configure a detection mechanism to detect whether the active router is working normally. If the active router fails, the backup router will take over its tasks. A ping or arp detection mechanism can be used to detect if the active router is working properly.
