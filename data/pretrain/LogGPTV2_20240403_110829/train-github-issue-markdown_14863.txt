### Description

A comprehensive guide detailing the usage of all PostgreSQL operators available in Apache Airflow would be highly beneficial. You can find the relevant operators in the following GitHub repository:
- [PostgreSQL Operators](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/master/airflow/providers/postgres)

For additional guidance, you may refer to the existing operator documentation:
- [Operator Documentation](https://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/operator/index.html)

The source code for these guides is located here:
- [Documentation Source Code](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/master/docs/howto/operator)

If you are interested in contributing to this project, we recommend starting with our contributor guide.
