User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to block external access to the DNS service running on a Cisco router? I have a Cisco (877) router acting as the main gateway for a network; it has a DSL connection and performs NAT from the internal network to its external, public IP address.

The router allows SSH access for management, and this has been limited using an access list:

access-list 1 permit &lt;internal network range&gt;

line vty 0 4
    transport input ssh
    access-class 1 in


The router's internal web server isn't enabled, but if it was, I know its access could be limited using the same logic:

ip http access-class 1


Now, the gotcha: this router also acts as a DNS server, forwarding queries to external servers:

ip name-server &lt;ISP DNS 1&gt;
ip name-server &lt;ISP DNS 2&gt;
ip dns server


My problem is: the router is perfectly happy to answer DNS queries when receiving them on its external interface.

How can I block this kind of traffic so that the router only answers DNS queries from the internal network?

Assistant: !Deny DNS from Public 
 ip access-list extended ACL-IN_FROM-WAN
  remark allow OpenDNS lookups
  permit udp 208.67.222.222 0.0.0.0 any eq domain
  permit tcp 208.67.220.220 0.0.0.0 any eq domain
  remark deny all others and log the attempts
  deny   udp any any eq domain log
  deny   tcp any any eq domain log
  permit ip any any

! Apply to WAN interface
 int WAN
  ip access-group ACLIN-TO_WAN in
