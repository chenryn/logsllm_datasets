Whenever suggest widget (e.g. a completion list) is summoned (by a configured
trigger character, e.g. `.` or `>`), both Tab and Enter are valid for
selection by default. More than once I've accidentally accepted the suggestion
rather than doing a line break as intended.
mitaki28/vscode-clang#8 is a good example of this where a `completionProvider`
is configured and triggered by `>`, causing issues when trying to do a line
break:

At first I thought I'd suggest that the default should be only Tab to avoid
all of this. But then I came to think that perhaps more ideally this should be
configurable by the extension that registers a provider with
`triggerCharacters`. What do you think?
