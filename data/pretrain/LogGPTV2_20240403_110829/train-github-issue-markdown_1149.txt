When a suggestion widget, such as a completion list, is triggered (by a configured trigger character, such as `.` or `>`), both the Tab and Enter keys are set as default selection methods. On multiple occasions, I have unintentionally accepted a suggestion when my intention was to create a line break.

A good example of this issue can be found in mitaki28/vscode-clang#8, where a `completionProvider` is configured and activated by the `>` character. This configuration leads to problems when attempting to insert a line break:

Initially, I considered proposing that only the Tab key should be the default for selections to avoid these issues. However, I believe it would be more ideal if the extension that registers a provider with `triggerCharacters` could configure this behavior. What are your thoughts on this?
