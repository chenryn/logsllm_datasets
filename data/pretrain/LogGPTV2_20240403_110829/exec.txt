**exec Command**

The `exec` command executes a script file on the local computer. It can also be used to duplicate or restore data as part of a backup or restore sequence. If the script fails, an error is returned, and DiskShadow will terminate.

### Syntax
```plaintext
exec <script_file>
```

### Parameters

- **`<script_file>`**: Specifies the path to the script file to be executed. The script file can be a `.cmd` or other supported script file type.

### Example
```plaintext
exec C:\Scripts\backup_script.cmd
```

This example runs the `backup_script.cmd` located in the `C:\Scripts` directory.

### Notes
- Ensure that the script file has the appropriate permissions and is accessible.
- The `exec` command is particularly useful for automating complex backup and restore operations.
