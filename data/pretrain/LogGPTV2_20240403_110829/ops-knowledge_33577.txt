User: Try to implement a solution that automatically scales the application, and can automatically expand the deployment during the peak period of system load.
Assistant: The automatic scaling application solution based on cloud computing technology is as follows: 1. Use containerization technology to package the application into a container image and deploy it on a container orchestration tool such as Kubernetes. 2. Configure an auto-scaling policy, trigger auto-scaling when the system load reaches a specified threshold, and add a certain number of container instances. 3. Use the cloud provider's automatic expansion service, such as AWS's Auto Scaling or Azure's Auto Scale to monitor the system load, and automatically adjust the number of container instances according to the load to meet the load requirements. 4. In order to better adapt to system load changes, you can adopt the strategy of merging first and then splitting, that is, first merging multiple container instances into one component, and then splitting the components when the load further increases, so as to shorten the container creation time and improve Responsiveness and efficiency. 5. For the expansion of large-scale container clusters, you can use automated deployment tools and configuration management tools, such as Ansible or Puppet, to automatically manage large-scale container clusters. At the same time, use container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, to implement scalable container clusters to adapt to the highest system load at the lowest cost.
