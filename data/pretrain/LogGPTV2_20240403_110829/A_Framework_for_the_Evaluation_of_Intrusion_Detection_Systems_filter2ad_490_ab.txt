small, for example on average only 1 out of 105 events is
−5), and if our detector has a probability
an attack (p = 10
of detection of one (PD = 1) and a false alarm rate of 0.01
(PFA = 0.01), then Pr[I = 1|A = 1] = 0.000999. That is on
average, of 1000 alarms, only one would be a real intrusion.
It is easy to demonstrate that the PPV value is maximized
when the false alarm rate of our detector goes to zero, even
if the detection rate also tends to zero! Therefore as men-
tioned in [3] we require a trade-off between the PPV value
and the negative predictive value (NPV):
NPV ≡ Pr[I = 0|A = 0] =
(1− p)(1− PFA)
p(1− PD) + (1− p)(1− PFA)

3.2. Discussion
The concept of ﬁnding the optimal tradeoff of the metrics
used to evaluate an IDS is an instance of the more general
problem of multi-criteria optimization. In this setting, we
want to maximize (or minimize) two quantities that are re-
lated by a tradeoff, which can be done via two approaches.
The ﬁrst approach is to ﬁnd a suitable way of combining
these two metrics in a single objective function (such as the
expected cost) to optimize. The second approach is to di-
rectly compare the two metrics via a trade-off curve.
We therefore classify the above deﬁned metrics into two
general approaches that will be explored in the rest of this
paper: the minimization of the expected cost and the trade-
off approach. We consider these two approaches as compli-
mentary tools for the analysis of IDSs, each providing its
own interpretation of the results.
Minimization of the Expected Cost.
Let ROC denote
the set of allowed (PFA, PD) pairs for an IDS. The expected
cost approach will include any evaluation metric that can be
expressed as

We now show how CID, and the tradeoff between the
PPV and NPV values can be expressed as an expected costs
problems. For the CID case note that the entropy of an in-
trusion H(I) is independent of our optimization parameters
(PFA, PD), therefore we have:

It is now clear that CID is an instance of the expected cost
problem with costs given by C(i, j) = −logPr[I = i|A = j].
By ﬁnding the costs of CID we are making the CID metric
more intuitively appealing, since any optimal point that we
ﬁnd for the IDS will have an explanation in terms of cost
functions (as opposed to the vague notion of diminishing
the uncertainty of the intrusions).
Finally, in order to combine the PPV and the NPV in an
average cost metric, recall that we want to maximize both

Pr[I = 1|A = 1] and Pr[I = 0|A = 0]. Our average gain for
each operating point of the IDS is therefore
ω1 Pr[I = I|A = 1]Pr[A = 1] + ω2 Pr[I = 0|A = 0]Pr[A = 0]
where ω1 (ω2) is a weight representing a preference towards
maximizing PPV (NPV). This equation is equivalent to the
minimization of
−ω1 Pr[I = I|A = 1]Pr[A = 1]−ω2 Pr[I = 0|A = 0]Pr[A = 0]
(7)
Comparing equation (7) with equation (2), we identify the
costs as being C(1,1) = −ω1, C(0,0) = −ω2 and C(0,1) =
C(1,0) = 0. Relating the predictive value metrics (PPV and
NPV) with the expected cost problem will allow us to ex-
amine the effects of the base-rate fallacy on the expected
cost of the IDS in future sections.
IDS classiﬁcation tradeoffs.
An alternate approach in
evaluating intrusion detection systems is to directly com-
pare the tradeoffs in the operation of the system by a trade-
off curve, such as ROC, or DET curves [21] (a reinterpreta-
tion of the ROC curve where the y-axis is 1−PD, as opposed
to PD). As mentioned in [3], another tradeoff to consider is
between the PPV and the NPV values. However, we do not
know of any tradeoff curves that combine these two values
to aid the operator in choosing a given operating point.
We point out in section 4.2 that a tradeoff between PFA
and PD (as in the ROC curves) as well as a tradeoff between
PPV and NPV can be misleading for cases where p is very
small, since very small changes in the PFA and NPV values
for our points of interest will have drastic performance ef-
fects on the PD and the PPV values. Therefore, in the next
section we introduce the IDOC as a new tradeoff curve be-
tween PD and PPV.
4. Graphical Analysis
We now introduce a graphical framework that allows the
comparison of different metrics in the analysis and evalu-
ation of IDSs. This graphical framework can be used to
adaptively change the parameters of the IDS based on its
actual performance during operation. The framework also
allows for the comparison of different IDSs under different
operating environments.
Throughout this section we use one of the ROC curves
analyzed in [9] and in [10]. Mainly the ROC curve describ-
ing the performance of the COLUMBIA team intrusion de-
tector for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation
[18]. Unless otherwise stated, we assume for our analysis
the base-rate present in the DARPA evaluation which was
p = 6.52× 10
−5.
4.1. Visualizing the Expected Cost: The
Minimization Approach
The biggest drawback of the expected cost approach is
that the assumptions and information about the likelihood
of attacks and costs might not be known a priori. Moreover,
these parameters can change dynamically during the system
operation. It is thus desirable to be able to tune the uncertain
IDS parameters based on feedback from its actual system
performance in order to minimize E[C(I, A)].
We select the use of ROC curves as the basic 2-D graph
because they illustrate the behavior of a classiﬁer without
regard to the uncertain parameters, such as the base-rate
p and the operational costs C(i, j). Thus the ROC curve
decouples the classiﬁcation performance from these factors
[24]. ROC curves are also general enough such that they
can be used to study anomaly detection schemes and mis-
use detection schemes (a misuse detection scheme has only
one point in the ROC space).

Figure 1. Isoline projections of CID onto the
ROC curve. The optimal CID value is CID =
0.4565. The associated costs are C(0,0) =
3× 10
−5, C(0,1) = 0.2156, C(1,0) = 15.5255 and
C(1,1) = 2.8487. The optimal operating point
is PFA = 2.76× 10
−4 and PD = 0.6749.
In the graphical framework, the relation of these uncer-
tain factors with the ROC curve of an IDS will be reﬂected
in the isolines of each metric, where isolines refer to lines
that connect pairs of false alarm and detection rates such
that any point on the line has equal expected cost. The eval-
uation of an IDS is therefore reduced to ﬁnding the point
of the ROC curve that intercepts the optimal isoline of the
metric (for signature detectors the evaluation corresponds
to ﬁnding the isoline that intercepts their single point in the
ROC space and the point (0,0) or (1,1)). In Figure 1 we can

see as an example the isolines of CID intercepting the ROC
curve of the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation.
One limitation of the CID metric is that it speciﬁes the
costs C(i, j) a priori. However, in practice these costs are
rarely known in advance and moreover the costs can change
and be dynamically adapted based on the performance of
the IDS. Furthermore the nonlinearity of CID makes it difﬁ-
cult to analyze the effect different p values will have on CID
in a single 2-D graph. To make the graphical analysis of the
cost metrics as intuitive as possible, we will assume from
now on (as in [9]) that the costs are tunable parameters and
yet once a selection of their values is made, they are con-
stant values. This new assumption will let us at the same
time see the effect of different values of p in the expected
cost metric.
Under the assumption of constant costs, we can see that
the isolines for the expected cost E[C(I, A)] are in fact
straight lines whose slope depends on the ratio between the
costs and the likelihood ratio of an attack. Formally, if we
want the pair of points (PFA1, PD1) and (PFA2, PD2) to have
the same expected cost, they must be related by the follow-
ing equation [23, 31, 24]:
p
= 1− p
= 1− p
C(0,1)−C(0,0)
C(1,0)−C(1,1)
mC,p ≡ PD2 − PD1
PFA1 − PFA2
1
C
(8)
where in the last equality we have implicitly deﬁned C to be
the ratio between the costs, and mC,p to be the slope of the
isoline. The set of isolines of E[C(I, A)] can be represented
by
p
I SOE = {mC,p × PFA + b : b ∈ [0,1]}
(9)
For ﬁxed C and p, it is easy to prove that the optimal op-
erating point of the ROC is the point where the ROC inter-
cepts the isoline in I SOE with the largest b (note however
that there are ROC curves that can have more than one opti-
mal point.) The optimal operating point in the ROC is there-
fore determined only by the slope of the isolines, which in
turn is determined by p and C. Therefore we can readily
check how changes in the costs and in the likelihood of an
attack will impact the optimal operating point.
Effect of the Costs.
In Figure 2, consider the operat-
ing point corresponding to C = 58.82, and assume that after
some time, the operators of the IDS realize that the number
of false alarms exceeds their response capabilities. In order
to reduce the number of false alarms they can increase the
cost of a false alarm C(0,1) and obtain a second operating
point at C = 10. If however the situation persists (i.e. the
number of false alarms is still much more than what op-
erators can efﬁciently respond to) and therefore they keep
increasing the cost of a false alarm, there will be a critical
slope mc such that the intersection of the ROC and the iso-
line with slope mc will be at the point (PFA, PD) = (0,0).

The interpretation of this result is that we should not use
the IDS being evaluated since its performance is not good
enough for the environment it has been deployed in. In or-
der to solve this problem we need to either change the envi-
ronment (e.g. hire more IDS operators) or change the IDS
(e.g. shop for a more expensive IDS).
The Base-Rate Fallacy Implications on the Costs of an
IDS. A similar scenario occurs when the likelihood of
an attack changes.
In Figure 3 we can see how as p de-
creases, the optimal operating point of the IDS tends again
to (PFA, PD) = (0,0) (again the evaluator must decide not to
use the IDS for its current operating environment). There-
fore, for small base-rates the operation of an IDS will be
such
cost efﬁcient only if we have an appropriate large C
that mC∗,p∗ ≤ mc. A large C
can be explained if cost of
a false alarm much smaller than the cost of a missed de-
tection: C(1,0) (cid:7) C(0,1) (e.g. the case of a government
network that cannot afford undetected intrusions and has
enough resources to sort through the false alarms).

Generalizations.
This graphical method of cost analysis
can also be applied to other metrics in order to get some
insight into the expected cost of the IDS. For example in
[6], the authors deﬁne an IDS with input space X to be
σ− sensitive if there exists an efﬁcient algorithm with the
same input space E : X → {¬A,A}, such that PE
≥ σ.
This metric can be used to ﬁnd the optimal point of an ROC
because it has a very intuitive explanation: as long as the
