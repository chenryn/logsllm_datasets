User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Metasploit Log or Additional Information Re: Exploit completed, but no session was created Almost all of my personal lab work with Metasploit has been unsuccessful. Most commonly I get the message "Exploit completed, but no session was created." I don't know what to do after this happens. Is there any way to read a log or discover more information about why this happens?

Assistant: Its Metasploit way telling you the exploit failed , because the system is patched and not vulnerable to this exploit, Or  possibly  that you have configured your payload handler wrong and so the payload code can't connect back.
