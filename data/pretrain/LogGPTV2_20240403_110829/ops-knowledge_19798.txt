User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题haproxy: adding tcplog parameters Slightly related to " Other options to &quot;balance source&quot; in haproxy", I would like to know what ports are currently pointed where.

To confirm, I'm using haproxy to distribute clients which make only a single connection at a time to a different port on the proxy, to different backend servers. Assume the protocol is ssh.

I'm using a stick-table to keep clients to one backend server until that server goes down. What's the best way to find out what the current state is?

I know I could make one frontend for each port then point them all at the same backend. The name of the frontend is then logged but i can't help but want one neat frontend with a range of ports and then dst_port logged.

Assistant: My current answer/solution (mentioned in the question) is as follows.

I define a different 'listen' for each port to be bound with a recognisable name.

I then ensure option tcplog is enabled for that frontend.

The logging then provides me the two pieces of information I need. The frontend and backend used.

e.g.

haproxy[18989]: 127.0.0.1:34550 [15/Oct/2003:15:24:28.312] frontend backend/server 0/0/5007 0 cD 0/0/0/0/0 0/0


I parse that log file 'magically' and use that information to present the latest status.

option logasap helps..
