User: How to find and delete large files in Linux system? Please list the command line operation methods and precautions.
Assistant: 1. Command line operation method: 1. Find all large files and output the result to a file: find /path/to/directory -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \; > filelist. txt Among them, /path/to/directory is the directory to be searched, -type f means to find only files, -size +100M means to find files whose size exceeds 100MB, -exec ls -lh {} \; means to find every The files are displayed with the ls -lh command, and the results are appended to filelist.txt with >>. 2. Sort the file list according to the file size: sort -k5 -hr filelist.txt Among them, -k5 means to sort by the fifth field (ie file size), -h means to display the file size in a "human-readable" way, - r means reverse sort. 3. Delete the file: rm filename where filename is the name of the file to be deleted. 2. Precautions: 1. When searching for large files, carefully consider the size setting. A size limit that is too small may miss some large files, while a size limit that is too large may include files that do not need to be deleted. 2. Before deleting a file, be sure to confirm again whether the file needs to be deleted. You can use the ls command to view detailed information about a file, or use the grep command to search for a specific file from the file list. 3. Try not to use wildcards to delete files, so as not to delete other files by mistake. If you need to delete multiple files, it is best to list them first, and then delete them one by one.
