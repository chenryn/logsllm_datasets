In the most recent update (Version 0.10.3 for Mac), typing a decimal number in `tsd.d.ts` triggers autocomplete suggestions for other libraries. For example, when attempting to type "0.1" or "1.1," the editor autocompletes to "Power0" from the `tweenMax` library. This issue seems to persist unless the `quickSuggestions` feature is disabled.

Here is an example demonstrating the problem:
- Attempting to type "0.1" or "1.1" results in the unwanted suggestion of "Power0" from `tweenMax`.

To illustrate this, please see the attached GIF:

Additionally, the `tsd.d.ts` file contains the following structure, which may be relevant to the issue:
```typescript
