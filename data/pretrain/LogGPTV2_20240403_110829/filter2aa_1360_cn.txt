Censys provides a detailed summary’ of the basics, which is quite redundant at this point. However, there arc 
three key’ pieces of information I access here on most domains. I previously’ mentioned the importance of 
checking the Subject .Alternative Names of a domain's SSL certificate. Most services conduct scans of the entire 
internet in order to retrieve this data. The moment a certificate is issued, it is provided in real-time to Censys. 
Censys thus docs not need to rely’ on internet scans to discover certificates, and more importantly' Subject 
Alternative Names. Therefore, I always click the "Details" button on the summary page and look for any’ 
interesting data by’ searching "alt_name" within the results. Next, I have relied on the HTTP Body text 
information stored within the "Details" page of the HTTP and HTTPS sections. This is basically the HTML 
code which makes the web page display properly within a browser. It is the same data you would see by viewing 
die source code of a target page. If the target website should disappear, this entire section of code could be 
copied; pasted into a text file; saved with an html extension; and opened within a browser to reveal the overall 
look and structure. I prefer to capture this data in the event of a modified or removed target web page.

This option searches a domain for any email addresses which exist within publicly available breaches. A search 
of my own domain found four active addresses.
Social networking sites, such as Twitter, have made the popularity of shortened URL services soar. When people 
post a link to something they want their friends to see, they do not want the link to take up unnecessary space. 
These sendees create a new URL, and simply point anyone to the original source when clicked. As an example, 
I converted a URL to a blog post from "https://inteltechniques.com/blog/2019/08/03/book-release-extreme- 
privacy/" to "https://bitly/32Up8h7".
You have likely seen these during your own investigations, and many people pay them little attention. There is 
actually a lot of information behind the scenes of these links that can reveal valuable information associated with 
your investigation. For a demonstration, I created the following shortened links, all of which forward to my 
home page. After, I will explain how to access the hidden data behind each service.
goo.gl/Ew9rlh 
bit.do/cbvNx
This sendee and search options function identical to the email queries. Provide the domain, and the results 
display the breaches which possess at least one email address matching the provided data. The URL query 
structure is https://dehashed.com/search?query="inteltechniques.com".
This domain option is currently in beta and will likely display results already found with the previous options.
This engine requires you to be logged in to a free account, which may not justify the results.
Bitly allows access to metadata by including a "+" after the URL. In our scenario, the direct URL would be 
bitly.com/29A4U 1U+. In this example, the results only identified that 21 people have clicked on my link. 
However, creating a free account reveals much more detail. After logging in, 1 can see any websites that referred 
the user to the link and extremely generic location data, such as the country' of the user. This is a good start
The domain search sendee behaves identical to their email query' option. They do not provide a direct URL 
query. A manual search should display email addresses associated with the target domain which appear within a 
data breach.
This sendee presents partial Pastebin files which include your target domain. A direct query' URL is 
https://intelx.io/?s=inteltechniques.com. A free trial is required to see all results.

Google gives us the same detail as above. It also uses 
goo.gl/Ew9rlh+. This demo notified me that 18 people h; 
are mosdy Windows users with the Chrome browser.
Third-Party Tracking: Some websites will hide their domain registration and host behind various protection 
services, but continue to use analytics, tracking, and Google services. Consider the previous methods of 
searching Analytics, and any other unique identifiers across other sites owned by the same target.
Historical: Use the previous methods to search historical domain registration records. While Whois sites may 
show Cloudflare today, historical registration records may show the actual web host used prior to Cloudflare. 
The result may or may not be the current hose
Crimeflare (crimeflare.org:82): This site aims to uncover criminal website owners hiding behind Cloudflare's 
free protection service. It is very hit or miss. You can enter any domain direcdy at crimeflare.org:82/cfs.html 
and potentially receive results identifying the IP address behind the target page. That IP can then be searched 
using the methods discussed in the next chapter.
Bit.do provides the most extensive data. They use a after the URL, and our direct demo address would be 
bit.do/cbvNx-. The results identify all of the details listed previously, plus the actual IP addresses of each visit. 
This type of service can be used in many ways. If you are investigating a viral Twitter post with a shortened 
URL, you may be able to learn more about the popularity' and viewers. You could also use this offensively. 
During covert investigations, you could forward a shortened URL from Bit.do and possibly obtain the IP address 
being used by the suspect. If you are investigating a shortened URL link that was not mentioned, consider using 
the catch-all service at CheckShortURL (checkshorturl.com).
Tiny.cc adds a to the end of a link to display metadata. In our example, the direct URL would be 
tiny.ee/v973ez~. The results on this page identify the number of times the URL was clicked, the number of 
unique visits, the operating systems of those that clicked the link, and the browsers used. This service also 
displays generic location data, such as the country' of the user.
the ”+” at the end, and our direct demo URL would be 
jave clicked my' link from 7 different countries. They’
While identifying web hosts and IP addresses behind your target domain, you are likely to encounter sites hiding 
behind Cloudflare. This company provides security' for websites which often prevents online attacks and 
outages. They' also help keep web host and owner details hidden when investigating criminal websites. There is 
no magic solution to uncover the owner of a website behind Cloud flare's protection, but we do have a few 
investigative options, as follows.
I mentioned Domains App (dmns.app) previously as a way to query’ stored historical screen captures. We can 
also use this resource to see much more DNS details than the sendees explained at the beginning of this chapter.
Censys (censys.io): Most websites possess Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates. Searching a domain name 
through the Censys "Certificates" search may identify historical SSL ownership records. The direct URL of 
"https://censys.io/certificates?q=inteltechniques.com" displays my own domain. The results identify my’ SSL 
host authority’ as Sectigo in 2020, Comodo (Namecheap) in 2018, and GoDaddy in 2016. You now know my 
domain host history’. This area of Censys can be beneficial to any' domain regardless of Cloudflare protection, 
which is a feature often overlooked. We can also query' a specific SSL certificate to potentially see other 
associated domains. The previous search identified "7583b0cb25632de96575dd0f00ff99fed81b9069" as the SSL 
certificate which I possessed in 2016. Searching this within Censys under the "Certificate" menu provides the 
domains of computercrimeinfo.com, inteltechniques.com, privacy-training.com. We now have other domains 
to investigate. Some of them may reveal the current domain registration provider and web host.

This can often include an email address within the DMARC data which is not visible elsewhere. Consider an 
example for michaelbazzell.com. We can query with the following direct URL.

The results identify the usual DNS suspects, including my web host and server IP address. However, there is 
new data in the last sections.
Similar to the previous custom search tools mentioned here, I have created a page for easier domain searching. 
While it does not possess even’ service discussed in this chapter, it can automate queries across the most 
beneficial options. Each box allows entry of a target domain name. The "Submit All" option will open several 
tabs within your browser that present each query listed on the page. The final section provides easy access to 
shortened URL metadata. Figure 23.10 displays a partial view of the tool.

We now know that all email for that domain is handled within a Protonmail account. We also see a new email 
address in the final DMARC section. For many domains which apply this extra level of email securin' and 
verification, you will find a legitimate email address which may have escaped your other analysis. As I write this, 
I learned of a personal email address included within results for a domain which is part of a current investigation. 
I have included this option within the search tool explained next.

This online port scanner looks for common ports that may be open. An open port indicates that a sendee is 
running on the web server that may allow public connection. A search of 54.208.51.71 revealed that ports 21, 
53, 80, and 443 are open to outside connections. Port 21 is for FTP connections, 53 is for DNS settings, 80 is 
for web pages, and port 443 is for secure web pages.
IP addresses are often obtained from an internet investigation, email message, or connection over the internet. 
When legal process is served to online content providers, a list of IP addresses used to log in to the account is 
usually presented as part of the return of information. Serving legal orders to identify and obtain IP addresses is 
outside the scope of this book. However, several techniques for collecting a target's IP address using OSINT 
are explained in this chapter. The previous instruction assumed that you were researching a domain name. These 
names, associated with websites, simply forward you to a numerical address that actually hosts the content. This 
is referred to as an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

The way that you encounter IP addresses as a target of your research will vary widely. Law enforcement may 
receive an IP address of an offender after submitting a subpoena to an internet provider. Any online researcher 
may locate an IP address while researching a domain with the previous methods. While only one website can be 
on a domain, multiple domains can be hosted on one IP address. The following resources represent only a
