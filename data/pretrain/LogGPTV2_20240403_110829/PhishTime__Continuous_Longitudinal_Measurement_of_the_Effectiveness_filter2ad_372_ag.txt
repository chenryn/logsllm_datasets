and by replicating them in a controlled setting, we were able
to identify and help address the gaps that attackers exploit
in existing defenses. With a high degree of automation, our
approach provides the (cid:30)exibility to deploy experiments that
not only realistically replicate current attacks, but can also be
used to proactively test emerging threats or new mitigations.
Anti-phishing defenses used by the ecosystem—including
browser blacklists—are highly complex systems. Amid a
record volume of phishing attacks [25], these defenses are
often capable of quickly responding to phishing websites. Yet,
as we observed, even a seemingly small failure in one system
component, such as a crawler or reporting channel, may allow
certain attacks to succeed and harm users. Analysis of data
from our empirical measurement approach can help pinpoint
such failures when they have an e(cid:29)ect on overall mitigation
performance.
Beyond making ecosystem-level recommendations, our
approach can bene(cid:27)t organizations impersonated by phishers.
Experiments that focus on a speci(cid:27)c brand can measure how
e(cid:29)ectivelytheecosystemhelpsprotectthatbrand’scustomers,
and how well the brand implements its own anti-phishing
mitigations, which may otherwise be di(cid:28)cult to measure.
Given the evolution of both phishing attacks and corre-
sponding defenses, we believe that longitudinal measure-
ments of the ecosystem are essential not only for maintaining
an understanding of the ecosystem’s protection, but also for
evaluating new security features as they are released, such
that the security of users can be continuously ensured.
