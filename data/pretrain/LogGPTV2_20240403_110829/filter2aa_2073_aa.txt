▶ Motivation #1: Communication channels are spying on our data.
▶ Motivation #2: Communication channels are modifying our data.
▶ Literal meaning of cryptography: “secret writing”.
▶ Achieves various security goals by secretly transforming messages.
▶ Conﬁdentiality: Eve cannot infer information about the content
▶ Integrity: Eve cannot modify the message without this being noticed
▶ Authenticity: Bob is convinced that the message originated from Alice

▶ Very easy solutions if Alice and Bob already share long secret key k:
▶ “One-time pad” for conﬁdentiality.
▶ “Wegman–Carter MAC” for integrity and authenticity.
▶ AES-256: Standardized method to expand short secret key (256-bit k)
into string indistinguishable from long secret key.
▶ AES introduced in 1998 by Daemen and Rijmen.
Security analyzed in papers by dozens of cryptanalysts.
▶ No credible threat from quantum algorithms. Grover costs 2128.
▶ Some results assume attacker has quantum access to computation, then some systems are
weaker . . . but I’d know if my laptop had turned into a quantum computer.

4 December 2018: Report on quantum computing
Don’t panic. “Key Finding 1: Given the current state of quantum computing and recent rates
of progress, it is highly unexpected that a quantum computer that can compromise RSA 2048
or comparable discrete logarithm-based public key cryptosystems will be built within the next
decade.”

or comparable discrete logarithm-based public key cryptosystems will be built within the next

Panic. “Key Finding 10: Even if a quantum computer that can decrypt current cryptographic
ciphers is more than a decade oﬀ, the hazard of such a machine is high enough—and the time
frame for transitioning to a new security protocol is suﬃciently long and uncertain—that
prioritization of the development, standardization, and deployment of post-quantum
cryptography is critical for minimizing the chance of a potential security and privacy disaster.”
“[Section 4.4:] In particular, all encrypted data that is recorded today and stored for future use,
will be cracked once a large-scale quantum computer is developed.”
