### Evaluation of Ocasta's Clustering Algorithm

#### Overview
We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of Ocasta, focusing on its clustering algorithm and the benefits it provides in recovering from configuration errors. Additionally, we conduct a user study to assess the ease of generating a trial, identifying the screenshot showing a fixed application, and using Ocasta in general. All Windows experiments were conducted on an Intel Core Duo Dual-Core laptop with 2 GB of memory running Windows 7, while all Linux experiments were performed on an Intel Core 2 Quad-Core desktop with 4 GB of memory running Debian 6. We used 11 popular desktop applications for our evaluations, as listed in Table II.

#### Clustering Analysis
To evaluate the accuracy of Ocastaâ€™s clustering algorithm, we manually examined all 255 clusters, each containing more than one configuration setting, across all applications. Our evaluation process involved two main steps:

1. **Correlation Verification**: We confirmed whether configuration settings are correlated by examining their names and values. We identified relationships from their hierarchical names and verified these relationships from their values.
2. **Dependency Testing**: We individually changed configuration settings in a cluster and checked if the corresponding application ran properly after the change. A cluster was considered correctly identified if there was a dependency relationship among every configuration setting in the cluster.

**Definitions**:
- **Oversized Cluster**: A cluster that contains one or more extra configuration settings not related to the other settings in the cluster.
- **Undersized Cluster**: A cluster that does not contain one or more related configuration settings.

**Accuracy Results**:
- The overall accuracy of Ocasta in identifying clusters with more than one setting is 88.6%.
- The mean accuracy among all applications is 72.3%.
- For most applications, except for those with a very small number of clusters (Evolution Mail, Internet Explorer, Text Editor, and MS Paint), Ocasta accurately identified clusters with more than one setting in 94% of the cases.

**Detailed Findings**:
- **Oversized Clusters**: Most incorrectly identified clusters are oversized, primarily due to the 1-second sliding time window and simultaneous updates during software updates.
- **Undersized Clusters**: These can cause failures in fixing configuration errors, as dependent settings are not updated together. Out of 16 injected errors, Ocasta fixed all but 2, which were due to undersized clusters. These issues were resolved by tuning the clustering threshold and window size.

### Configuration Repair

To simulate realistic application usage and precisely control the timing of configuration errors, we injected writes into the trace at specific points. If the error was caused by the presence or absence of a setting, we inserted or deleted the setting in the trace. To simulate the recording phase of Ocasta, we populated the TTKV of the test machine with one of the collected traces.
