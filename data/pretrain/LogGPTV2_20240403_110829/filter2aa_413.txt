### DefCon Groups (DCG) Naming and Guidelines

#### Review the Post at: [DefCon Groups Naming Guide](https://defcongroups.org/dcgstart.html)

The naming convention for DefCon Groups is based on local phone codes, specifically dialing and area codes from the USA. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Naming Convention**:
   - The designation should follow the format `DC###-A`, `DC###-B`, etc.
   - For example, Edmonton, Canada, would be `DC780` because of its North American dialing code.
   - Similarly, Bilda, Algeria, would be `DC11213` (where 21 is the country code and 3 is the city code).

2. **Invalid Names**:
   - You cannot use names like `DC042`, `DC666`, or `DC11010100011`.

3. **Logo and Branding**:
   - Just like well-known brands such as Coca-Cola and Ford, DefCon does not allow unauthorized use of their logo.

4. **Communication Guidelines**:
   - Please use plain text only for communication.
   - Do not send PDFs, DOCX files, or other document formats.
   - Image files are an exception, particularly for logos and other photos.

5. **Q&A with the DCG Core Team**:
   - Engage in Q&A sessions with the DCG core team to get your questions answered.

6. **Sharing Ideas and Collaboration**:
   - Share ideas with other groups regarding projects, meeting spaces, and marketing strategies.
   - Connect with other DefCon Groups to expand your network and collaborate on initiatives.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation!
