User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题ONLY allow HTTPS, HTTP and Postgres Outgoing ports I have Ubuntu server and I ONLY want to allow outgoing connections to ANY IP to the following:


HTTPS
HTTP
Postgres


I want to block all other ports. And I would like to see connections being made from the ports so I can open the ports in case needed.

How can I set it up on Ubuntu 18.04?

Assistant: A  rules set for outgoing connections might be :

# Allow establishing connections to desired set of services
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 5432 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Log any outgoing connection attempts
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m tcp -p tcp  -j LOG --log-uid --log-prefix="outgoing connection: "    

# Allow incomig traffic for established connections
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# set default policy to drop
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP


Use ip6tables to add IPv6 rules, if necessary. 

I assume, you still need to allow ssh access to be able to access the host. 

**Be aware: by misconfiguring firewall rules remotely you can lock yourself out! **
