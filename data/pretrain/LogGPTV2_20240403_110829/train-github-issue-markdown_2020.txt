`std::f32` doc page has `impl Float for f32` at the top and at the bottom.
  * The bottom one seems to have more elements though it's not clear why.
  * Their styling is the same so it's not obvious if they should mean 2 different things.
Something should change so either they don't look like misshapen clones or
it's clear what they mean.
