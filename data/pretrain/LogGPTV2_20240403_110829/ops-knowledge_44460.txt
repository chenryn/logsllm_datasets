User: Some basic requirements and desires:

Windows/Mac/Linux
Run as "full screen" within the terminal window, resizes as needed.
Network multi player (loose requirement, although definitely would like to)
Basic sounds
Would like to write in Python since I'm learning that.
Distributable as a single package, as in no run time dependencies that aren't built in or fairly commonplace.

Am I proposing something impossible? 
Is Python up to the task?
Will I have trouble with Windows terminal?
I'm not necessarily hellbent on using Python, however I've been learning it for other purposes, so I'd like to "keep it in the family" if at all possible.
Thanks for any insight.
Assistant: Getting terminal size in a cross-platform and reliable way is far from trivial (see termcap, curses and such).
