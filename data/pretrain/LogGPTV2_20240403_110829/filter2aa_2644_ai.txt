10. Definitions 
• 
BOM:  Bill of Materials, a list of items included as part of a package 
• 
CAP: Corrective Action Program gives requirements for identifying, reporting, evaluating and correcting 
problems with a plant. 
• 
CIP:  Critical Infrastructure Protection, standards created by the North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation to regulate non-nuclear power plants. 
• 
Device:  Usually refers to a device in the lowest level of automation, either a sensor or a control valve.  
See Also Cyber Device. 
• 
Control System:  A set of devices used to automate the operation of processes and pieces of equipment. 
• 
Cyber Device (Subjective Definition):  A programmable electronic device whose primary programming 
interface is not implemented using a local non electronic method such as a keypad. 
• 
DCS:  Distributed Control System, a type of control device whose components are typically distributed 
throughout a plant, but work together to control a process. DCSs usually include PC based HMIs. 
• 
Defense In Depth:  A security strategy for slowing down or stopping an attack.  Defense in Depth 
assumes one or more security precautions will fail and implements one or more layers of back-up 
precautions. 
• 
DMZ:  Demilitarized Zone, a portion of a plant’s network which connects an untrusted zone to a trusted 
zone. 
• 
ESP:  Electronic Security Perimeter, a virtual enclosure around a critical digital asset.  Access to and from 
the ESP is carefully monitored and controlled. 
• 
Hardening:  ensuring that only those ports, programs, and services required for normal and emergency 
operations are enabled, ensuring the security policies are met and to add or strengthen security 
mechanisms (e.g. virus protection) to result in a more secure system than initial examination revealed. 
Hardening can be both physical and electronic. 
• 
HMI:  Human Machine Interface, a device which allows an operator to communicate with and receive 
feedback from a system by means of reading from or sending information to the system. 
• 
IDPS:  Intrusion Detection and Prevention Software, a system that monitors for unusual, malicious or 
unauthorized activity and reports. 
• 
NERC:  North American Electric Reliability Corporation, organization which provides standards for and 
oversight of the operation of power plants in North America. 
• 
NIST:  National institute of Standards and Technology, government organization which creates standards 
for a number of topics and fields. 
• 
NRC:  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, body governing the operation of nuclear power plants in the 
United States. 
• 
OPC:  OLE for Process Control, a set of standards for communication between automation devices in an 
industrial plant.

• 
PLC:  Programmable Logic Controller, a device capable of performing control output based on given 
inputs and a programmed set of sequential logic. 
• 
PSP:  Physical Security Perimeter, a physical enclosure around a critical area or asset.  Access to and 
from the PSP is carefully monitored and controlled 
• 
SCADA:  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, typically higher level control devices which 
coordinates between several processes and displays and records information about the operation of the 
entire plant. 
• 
Surface Area Reduction:  A type of hardening for electronic devices that involves removing unnecessary 
software and services and shutting down unused ports. 
• 
Trusted Zone:  The portion of a network where communications are assumed to be safe. 
• 
Untrusted Zone:  The portion of a network where communications are assumed to be unsafe.
