User: Please describe the difference and connection between checkout and update commands in svn version control.
Assistant: The checkout command is used to download the entire content of a code base to the local and create a working copy. This command only needs to be executed once, and then only needs to be modified and submitted in the workspace. The update command is used to synchronize the files in the workspace with the remote warehouse. After executing the update command, svn will check for updates in the remote repository and download the updates to the local workspace. If there are uncommitted local modifications in the workspace, the update command will try to merge the remote repository's updates and local modifications. It can be said that the checkout command is to copy the remote warehouse to the local, and the update command is to synchronize the local workspace with the remote warehouse. The connection between them is that the update command needs to use the workspace created by the checkout command to achieve synchronization.
