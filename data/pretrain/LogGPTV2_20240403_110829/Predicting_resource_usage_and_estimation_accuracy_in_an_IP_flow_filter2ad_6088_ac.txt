### Decomposition of Variance

We can decompose the variance of \(\hat{y}\) into the component due to the estimation step and the inherent variance of \(\hat{x}\) as follows:

**Lemma 1.** 
\[ \text{Var}(\hat{y}) = E\left[\left(\frac{\hat{x}}{p(\hat{x})} - 1\right)^2\right] + \text{Var}(\hat{x}). \]

Applying this lemma to each sampling stage in the formation of \(\hat{X}\), we obtain the following results for the variance of \(\hat{X}\), which are proved, along with Lemma 1, in the Appendix. Let \(x_{\text{max}}\) denote the maximum flow size and \(b_{\text{max}}\) the maximum packet size.

**Theorem 1.** Assume independent packet sampling with period \(N\) and smart flow sampling with threshold \(z\).

1. \(\hat{X}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(X\).
2. \[ \text{Var}(\hat{X}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \left( \frac{E\left[\hat{x}_i \cdot \max\left\{ zq - \hat{x}_i, 0 \right\}\right]}{q m_i} \right) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \frac{b_{ij}^2}{q m_i} + \frac{N-1}{q}. \]
3. \[ \text{Var}(\hat{X}) \leq \frac{1}{q} \left( z + (1 - q)x_{\text{max}} + (N - 1)b_{\text{max}} \right). \]
4. When flows can be split, the same bound (iii) holds for the variance \(\text{Var}(\hat{X})\).

### Interpretation of Theorem 1

The expressions in Theorem 1(ii) and (iii) are sums over contributions from different types of sampling: the first from smart sampling, the second from the loss of flow records, and the third from packet sampling. We now interpret the meanings of these terms.

| 500             | 10%       | 0%             | 3.16% | 2.88%  | 1.05% | 4.41%  |
| 500             | 50%       | 0%             | 3.16% | 3.87%  | 3.16% | 5.91%  |

### Computational Issues

When \(q = 1\) (no transmission loss), the bound (iii) requires only two broad characteristics of the traffic: the total volume \(X\) to be estimated and the maximum packet size \(b_{\text{max}}\). The latter can be bounded above by the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the network under measurement. In contrast, the exact expression (ii) requires detailed knowledge of each flow, including packet sizes, which may not be available, and is computationally more intensive. As shown in Section 7, the bound provides a close approximation to the actual variance in cases examined.

### The Effect of Sparse Flows

Although the upper bound in Theorem 1(iii) is unaffected by splitting sparse flows, the expression (ii) is generally impacted. The variance due to flow loss decreases as flows are split across multiple reports. The variance due to packet sampling remains unchanged, while the smart sampling variance may increase or decrease.

### Large Flows and Estimator Variance

When \(X\) is dominated by one very large flow, the last term in the variance bound may be close to \((1 - q)/q\). The standard error may be quite large if the dropping rate is also high. This is expected because smart sampling was applied to mitigate the effects of uniform sampling on flow records with heavy-tailed distributions. We recommend that the bandwidth for transmitting raw flow records and computational resources on the collector be sufficient to accommodate the records without loss under normal operation. Later in this paper, we provide estimates for the required bandwidth.

### Comparing Variance: Packet, Smart Sampling

If our recommendation to dimension the collection infrastructure for no report loss is followed, the bound in Theorem 1(iii) simplifies to:
\[ \text{Var}(\hat{X}) \leq X(z + (N - 1)b_{\text{max}}). \]
From this bound, the ratio of variance due to smart sampling to that due to packet sampling is approximately \(z / (N b_{\text{max}})\). For typical values \(b_{\text{max}} = 1,500\) bytes and \(N = 100\), the smart sampling variance exceeds the packet sampling variance only when \(z > 150\) kBytes.

### Resampling of Aggregates

In the TAP infrastructure, smart-sampled flow records may be aggregated over time, and the resulting aggregates may be subject to further smart sampling with a threshold \(z_2\). Without aggregation, it was shown in [7] that the composition of \(n\) smart sampling stages with thresholds \(z_1, \ldots, z_n\) is equivalent to a single smart sampling with threshold \(\max_i z_i\). With aggregation, no such simple relation exists. However, applying Lemma 1 and the bounding methods used to establish Theorem 1(iii), the additional variance in \(\hat{X}\) introduced is bounded above by \(q^{-1} X z_2\).
