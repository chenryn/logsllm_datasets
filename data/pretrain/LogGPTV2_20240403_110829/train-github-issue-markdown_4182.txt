## Steps to Reproduce

I would like the `TextField`'s hint text to remain visible until the user interacts with another part of the UI. The interaction point could be deeply nested within the widget tree, and I am unsure how to access the currently focused node in order to call `unfocus` and display the `TextField` as inactive while hiding the keyboard. This may stem from a lack of understanding of Flutter or the documentation, which does not provide sufficient examples or explanations for implementing this pattern.

The provided code example demonstrates a `GestureDetector` that calls `unfocus` on the `FocusNode`. This is straightforward in this case because the `FocusNode` is easily accessible within the same widget. However, I need guidance on how to achieve the same functionality in a more complex, nested widget tree. What is the recommended approach for this?

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text(widget.title),
    ),
    body: Stack(
      children: [
        GestureDetector(
          excludeFromSemantics: true,
          onTapDown: (_) {
            _focusNode.unfocus();
          },
        ),
        Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              focusNode: _focusNode,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                border: InputBorder.none,
                hintText: _focusNode.hasFocus ? 'FOCUS' : 'no focus',
              ),
            ),
            RaisedButton(
              child: Text('Remove Focus'),
              onPressed: () => _focusNode.unfocus(),
            )
          ],
        )
      ],
    ),
  );
}

final FocusNode _focusNode = FocusNode();

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _focusNode.addListener(() {
    setState(() {});
    print('Has focus: ${_focusNode.hasFocus}');
  });
}
```
