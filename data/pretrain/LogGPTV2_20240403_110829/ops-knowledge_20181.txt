User: Please describe the implementation principle of virtualization technology and commonly used virtualization software
Assistant: The realization principle of virtualization technology is to run multiple virtual operating systems on a physical computer, and each virtual operating system can run its own software program. These virtual operating systems share the hardware resources of the computer, such as CPU, memory, disk, network and so on. To implement virtualization, virtualization software (hypervisor) is installed on a physical computer. This hypervisor allows multiple virtual machines to run simultaneously. Each virtual machine is an independent operating system and a complete user space environment. The virtual machine can start the operating system from a "virtual hard disk" and access its own software and data. And share traffic and storage with other virtual machines and physical computers at the same time. Commonly used virtualization software includes: 1. VMware 2. VirtualBox 3. Microsoft Hyper-V 4. KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) 5. Citrix Hypervisor (formerly known as XenServer) 6. Docker (Container-based virtualization)
