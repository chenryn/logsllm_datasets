User: In the Biopython installation instructions, it says that if Biopython doesn't work I'm supposed to do this:
export PYTHONPATH = $PYTHONPATH':/directory/where/you/put/Biopython'
I tried doing that in Cygwin from the ~ directory using the name of the Biopython directory (or everything of it past the ~ directory), but when I tested it by going into the Python interpreter and typing in


From Bio.Seq import Seq


It said the module doesn't exist.
How do I make it so that I don't have to be in the Biopython directory to be able to import Seq?
Assistant: You wrote "(or everything of it past the ~ directory)".  I think you need to use the full directory path.  And ~ isn't expanded immediately after a ':', so use $HOME instead:
export PYTHONPATH = $PYTHONPATH":$HOME/directory/where/you/put/Biopython"
(Note the use of double rather than single quotes so $HOME is expanded.)
