User: How to use Git for version control while securing critical deployments in production.
Assistant: 1. Use branch management: Use Git's branch management function to put the production environment and development environment in different branches. Version control is performed in the development environment. When the new version is tested and passed, it is merged into the production environment branch for deployment. 2. Use tags to control version release: In a production environment, use Git's tag function to control version release. Before each release of a new version, put a label on it to ensure that the code has not been modified and has passed the test before deploying. 3. Restrict permissions: Grant the Git warehouse permission of the production environment to only a few developers and operation and maintenance personnel, so as to prevent misuse by unauthorized personnel from causing errors in the production environment. 4. Make a good backup: In the production environment, make regular backups and store the backup files in a safe place to prevent data loss due to unexpected circumstances. 5. Risk assessment: When deploying new code, you should first conduct a risk assessment and formulate a response strategy. If the risk is found to be high, you can choose to suspend the deployment and wait for further evaluation before making a decision.
