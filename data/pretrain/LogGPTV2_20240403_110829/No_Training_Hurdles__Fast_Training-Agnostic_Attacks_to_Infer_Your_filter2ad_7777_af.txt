method requires collecting 10 minutes worth of keystrokes (around
340 words) for a word recovery rate of 87.6%. This minimized train-
ing method may not function for wireless based attacks, as due to
the time-varying nature of the wireless channel, a training time of
10 minutes may be too long to generate a useful mapping between
observed CSI samples and letters. Unlike [42], frequency analysis,
and all other statistical methods, the proposed method explores the
self-contained structures of words, which can be observed for each
word immediately as it is typed, rather than probabilistic statistics
among words, which require many words to establish. Thus, the
proposed attack only needs 50 words within 1-2 minutes for a word
recovery rate of 94.3%.
An adversary may use a triangulation localization technique to
localize the sound source and accordingly infer which keys are
typed [19, 41]. This approach, however, requires the adversary to
have sophisticated equipment that can precisely measure the sound
propagation distance from the key to equipment, and also requires
line-of-sight between the keyboard and equipment. Both of these
requirements hinder attack plausibility and application. Berger et
al. infer keystrokes with the observation that similar sounds are
highly likely to come from keys positioned close to each other on
the keyboard [9]. This technique aims to reconstruct a single long
(7-13 characters) word that must appear in the dictionary, whereas
the goal of the proposed attack is to reconstruct the entire typed
content regardless of whether or not all its constituent words are
in the dictionary.
Timing based attacks: Keystroke timing patterns can be another
source to infer keystrokes [28, 32, 40]. For example, [32] infers
keystroke sequences by using the inter-keystroke timing infor-
mation collected from the arrival times of the SSH packets. [28]
proposes to infer keystrokes by utilizing the keystroke timing in-
formation gathered via cache-based load measurements on an idle
machine. [40] infers keystroke sequences by utilizing the shared
information on a multi-user system. However, except for the ways
to obtain the keystroke timing information (e.g., launching a SSH
session [32], installing a malicious virtual machine on the target
physical machine [28], owning a user account on a multi-core sys-
tem [40]), these timing-based attacks all require a training process
to statistically generate the attack models.
Wireless signal based attacks: There are emerging research efforts
performing keystroke eavesdropping attacks using wireless signals
due to the ubiquitous deployment of wireless infrastructures, the
radio signal nature of invisibility, and the elimination of the line-of-
sight requirement. In particular, [11] infers keystrokes by examining
the amplitude and phase changes of the wireless signal, and [6, 18]
utilize the channel condition extracted from the observed wireless
signal to distinguish keystrokes. All these works still require a
training process to construct the relationship between the observed
signal feature and the typing.
Camera-based attacks: A traditional and intuitive method to infer
keystrokes is to use cameras to record the typing process and then
identify keystrokes by analyzing the recorded video. Researchers
have found that video recording of hand movement [8, 31, 39], tablet
backside motion [33], or the shadow around fingertips [38], is also
able to aid the keystroke inference. However, when the movement
of interest does not happen in the presence of a camera, keystroke
activities cannot be detected.
Cryptanalysis based attacks: Cryptanalysis is a technique of dis-
covering secrets. Cryptanalysis attacks can be in the form of known-
plaintext or ciphertext-only attacks. If we consider the CSI sample
as the ciphertext and the original typed content as the plaintext,
the training-based keystroke inference attacks [6, 18] are indeed
known-plaintext attacks, because the attacker must know some
plaintext (i.e., typed content) and the corresponding ciphertext (i.e.,
CSI) for training. The proposed method does not require the training
data and thus it is a ciphertext-only attack. Existing ciphertext-only
attacks that attempt to decode the ciphertext of natural language
are largely based on the statistical information about the cipher-
text [22, 25]. For example, [25] regards the author of an instant
message conversation as the plaintext and applies character fre-
quency analysis to instant messages for authorship identification
and validation. [22] recovers the plaintext by using a statistical
language model and a dynamic programming algorithm.
Session 9B: Mobile 2 CCS’18, October 15-19, 2018, Toronto, ON, Canada1758Nevertheless, collecting statistical information implies that the
attacker needs to acquire a large amount of ciphertext. This may
not be suitable for the wireless based keystroke inference, because
collecting the wireless statistics does require a long time period
of observation. As mentioned earlier, this can prevent the attacker
from collecting sufficient reliable statistics for accurate keystroke
inference. The proposed method is based on the self-contained
feature of words instead and thus does not require the long-time
observation about wireless statistics.
7 CONCLUSION
We identify a new type of keystroke eavesdropping attack. Com-
pared with all previously discovered attacks, the attack reported
in this paper can bypass (1) the requirement of the training phase,
which is impractical for most attack scenarios, (2) the requirement
to deceive the user or bypass the user’s anti-virus and firewall
software to install malware on the target device, and (3) the re-
quirement of line-of-sight between the attacker’s device and the
keyboard. This attack is constructed based on the CSI extracted
from the wireless signal. An essential component to this attack is
a joint demodulation algorithm, which we create to establish the
mapping between each letter and the corresponding CSI sample
without training. We implement this attack on USRP X300 platform
running GNURadio, and conduct experiments to validate this attack.
The experiment results show that the word recovery ratio of the
proposed attack is 0.95 for an input of 150 words, whereas that of
the traditional frequency analysis method is less than 0.02.
