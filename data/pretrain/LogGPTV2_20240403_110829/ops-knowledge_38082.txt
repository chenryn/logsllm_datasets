User: Please analyze the security risks existing in the current system and propose corresponding security solutions.
Assistant: Analysis: 1. Weak passwords are easy to be guessed and cracked. 2. There is no limit to the number of user login attempts, which may be cracked by brute force. 3. No encryption of sensitive information, such as user account passwords, etc. 4. If there is no protection against external attacks, it may be attacked by hackers. 5. Without an authentication mechanism, there may be a risk of illegal intrusion. Solutions: 1. Set password complexity rules, force users to use strong passwords, and store passwords encrypted. 2. Set a limit on the number of incorrect logins, and when the limit is reached, the account will be locked and the user will be prompted to change the password. 3. Encrypt and store sensitive information, and use encryption protocols for information transmission to ensure that information will not be stolen. 4. Strengthen technical means such as system firewalls, security software, and encryption mechanisms to resist external attacks. 5. Design a complete identity verification mechanism, such as two-factor authentication, fingerprint recognition, etc., to improve system security.
