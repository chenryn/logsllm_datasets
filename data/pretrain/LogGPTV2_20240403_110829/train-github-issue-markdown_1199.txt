## ðŸš€ Feature
If a model consists of a DDP submodule, the module cannot be torchscripted
since DDP itself cannot be torchscripted.
## Motivation
Certain complex models (especially with model parallelism) might consist of
submodules where only some of the submodules need to be replicated via DDP.
Torchscripting such a complex module would fail since DDP is not
torchscriptable. Supporting torchscript for DDP would allow users much more
flexibility in how they build and torchscript complex models.
