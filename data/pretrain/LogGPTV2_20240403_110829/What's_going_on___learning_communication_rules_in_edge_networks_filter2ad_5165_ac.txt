ing similar rules. Our analysis generates hundreds of statistically
signi(cid:12)cant rules on a packet trace; hence it is worthwhile to attempt
clustering similar rules into easier-to-understand groups. We found
two techniques to be helpful. ˆe (cid:12)rst is rather simple. We trans-
form the discovered rules into a rule-graph, wherein each rule is a
directed edge joining the nodes corresponding to the  tuples that comprise the rule. We then take a transitive clo-
sure of the rule-graph to identify clusters of rules that involve re-
lated (cid:8)ows, for e.g., X ⇒ Y1, X ⇒ Y2, Y1 ⇒ Z will belong to
the same transitive closure. ˆe second technique is more complex
and is motivated by our observation that the rule-graph consists of
highly clustered components that are connected by “weak” edges,
i.e., rules with low statistical signi(cid:12)cance. Hence, we apply spectral
partitioning [ʅʆ] to the rule-graph, to remove such weak edges be-
tween strongly connected components. Speci(cid:12)cally, if A is the adja-
cency matrix of the rule-graph, where each matrix entry is the sig-
ni(cid:12)cance score of the corresponding rule, we recursively partition

Before detailing the kinds of rules discovered by eXpose, we
present the bigger picture. eXpose augments a packet trace with
generics–abstract versions of the real (cid:8)ows, evaluates many poten-
tial (cid:8)ow/generic pairs to extract the signi(cid:12)cant rules and clusters to-
gether rules that are similar to one other. Table ʆ shows for each of
our traces the progression of eXpose through each of these phases.
In this context, it is easy to place our chief contribution—a tech-
nique to identify the few hundred signi(cid:12)cant patterns from among
the 1010 − 1012 possibilities. To achieve this, eXpose selectively
biases search by not evaluating rules that are unlikely to be useful.
