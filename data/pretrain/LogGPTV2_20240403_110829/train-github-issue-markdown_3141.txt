I have encountered issues with `numpy` on my Raspberry Pi, which is running Raspbian. Despite multiple attempts to uninstall and reinstall the package, the problem persists.

**Background:**
- I installed Python 3.7 using console commands some time ago.
- My system has multiple versions of Python installed.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Uninstalling `numpy`:**
   ```sh
   pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo python3.7 -m pip uninstall numpy
   Uninstalling numpy-1.17.2:
     Would remove:
       /usr/local/bin/f2py
       /usr/local/bin/f2py3
       /usr/local/bin/f2py3.7
       /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy-1.17.2.dist-info/*
       /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/*
   Proceed (y/n)? y
   Successfully uninstalled numpy-1.17.2
   ```

2. **Reinstalling `numpy`:**
   ```sh
   pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo python3.7 -m pip install numpy
   Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://www.piwheels.org/simple
   Collecting numpy
     Using cached https://www.piwheels.org/simple/numpy/numpy-1.17.2-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl
   Installing collected packages: numpy
   Successfully installed numpy-1.17.2
   ```

**Error Message:**
```sh
Original error was: libf77blas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

**Additional Information:**
- The error suggests that a required shared library (`libf77blas.so.3`) is missing from the system.
