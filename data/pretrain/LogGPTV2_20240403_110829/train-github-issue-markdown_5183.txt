### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
When running `npm ci` in a directory with an existing `node_modules` that
contains a `.bin` directory, the command fails with the following exception:
    43 verbose stack SystemError [ERR_FS_EISDIR]: Path is a directory: rm returned EISDIR (is a directory) {PATH_TO_PROJECT}/node_modules/.bin
    43 verbose stack     at new SystemError (node:internal/errors:250:5)
    43 verbose stack     at new NodeError (node:internal/errors:361:7)
    43 verbose stack     at node:internal/fs/utils:784:17
    43 verbose stack     at callback (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js:306:20)
    43 verbose stack     at FSReqCallback.oncomplete (node:fs:191:5)
### Expected Behavior
Expect `npm ci` to work regardless of if the `node_modules` directory already
exists.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. With this config  
Sample `package.json`
    {
      "name": "esbuild-binary",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "dependencies": {
        "esbuild": "^0.14.13"
      }
    }
  2. Generate lockfile then run `npm ci`
