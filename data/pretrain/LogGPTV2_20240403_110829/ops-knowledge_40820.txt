User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of computing data from a HadoopRDD. The CacheManager is looking for partitions rdd_42_15, rdd_42_16, and rdd_42_17, and when they are not found, they are computed. The PythonRunner is timing the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. The Executor is running tasks 11.0, 13.0, 16.0, 17.0, 12.0, 14.0, and 18.0 in stage 26.0, and sending 2703 bytes of result to the driver.
