User: How to set up a scheduled task on a Linux server so that it will run automatically according to the schedule at the specified time?
Assistant: You can use the crontab command to set a scheduled task on a Linux server. The steps are as follows: 1. Open the terminal and use the following command to open the crontab editor: ``` crontab -e ``` 2. In the editor, add the running time of the scheduled task and the command to be run, the format is: ``` * * * * * command ``` where each asterisk represents a time unit, and from left to right are minutes, hours, days, months, and weeks. For example, "*/5 * * * *" means run every 5 minutes. 3. Save and exit the editor. 4. If you need to view the scheduled tasks that have been set, you can use the following command: ``` crontab -l ``` 5. If you need to delete a certain scheduled task, you can use the following command: ``` crontab -r ``` Note : When editing a scheduled task, confirm whether the command can run normally in the terminal, otherwise the scheduled task will fail to run.
