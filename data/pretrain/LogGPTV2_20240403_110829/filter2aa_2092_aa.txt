## What is Attribution?
- **Definition**: Identifying the source of a cyber attack.
  - Determining the location of an attacker (Hunker et al., 2008; Wheeler and Larsen, 2003)
  - Identifying the country or organization behind an attack (Rid and Buchanan, 2014)
  - “Determining who is responsible for a hostile cyber act” (Mejia, 2014)
  - “We must find a person, not a machine” (Clark and Landau, 2011)

- **Benefits**:
  - Deterrence of future attacks
  - Improvement of defenses
  - Disruption of ongoing attacks (Hunker et al., 2008)
  - Debate on whether attribution leads to deterrence (Guitton, 2012)
  - Desirable outcome, depending on the perspective (Clark and Landau, 2011)

- **Types** (Hutchins et al., 2011):
  - Atomic
  - Computed
  - Behavioral

## Problems with Attribution
- **Hiding Atomic Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
  - Most effective identifiers
  - Easy to resolve but also easy to spoof, anonymize, or obfuscate

- **Issues with Computed IOCs**:
  - Changes in malware make it harder
  - Other methods:
    - Correlating activity with office hours in time zones (Rid & Buchanan, 2014; CloudHopper)
    - Deanonymizing developers through artefacts (Caliskan et al., 2015)
    - Similar malware capabilities (Moran & Bennett, 2013; Symantec, 2011)
    - Distinguishing humans vs. bots (Filippoupolitis et al., 2014)

- **Behavioral Profiling**:
  - Less focused on individual identification
  - More about understanding motivations and behaviors
  - Motivation, skills, and attack behaviors (Landreth, 1985)
  - Attitudes and culture (Chiesa et al., 2008; Watters et al., 2012)
  - Psychological factors (Shaw et al., 1998)

## Case Linkage Analysis
- **The Idea**:
  - Observations from OSCP labs: everyone has a unique way of conducting attacks, and these patterns rarely change.
  - Empirical testing using Case Linkage Analysis (CLA), a methodology from crime science literature.

- **Benefits of Linking Offenses**:
  - Attributing unsolved crimes
  - Focused resource allocation
  - Evidentiary value
  - Growing database for better success rates
  - Minority of offenders commit the majority of specialized crimes

- **What CLA Is**:
  - Uses behavioral evidence
  - Classifies granular crime behaviors into domains
  - Creates linked and unlinked pairs of offenses
  - Compares behaviors across offenses
  - Determines the degree of similarity

- **What CLA Isn't**:
  - Not offender profiling
  - Makes statistical inferences about the similarity of offenses based on common behaviors

- **Key Assumptions**:
  - Behavioral consistency: offenders display similar behaviors across crimes
  - Behavioral distinctiveness: the way an offender commits crimes is characteristic and distinguishable

- **Methodology**:
  - Separate behaviors into domains
  - Calculate similarity coefficients
  - Use logistic regression models
  - Determine optimal combination of domains
  - Use Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for predictive accuracy

- **Example**:
  - Two burglaries, A and B
  - Define a dichotomous dependent variable
  - Use granular behaviors in domains (e.g., entry, property)
  - Apply Jaccard’s similarity coefficient
  - Use logistic regression to predict the likelihood of linkage
  - Forward stepwise logistic regression to determine the best domain combination
  - ROC curves to measure overall predictive accuracy

- **Exceptions**:
  - Some offenses (e.g., homicide) are less suitable
  - Some offenders show more distinctiveness than others
  - Behaviors under the offender's control are more stable
  - Limited to solved crimes and small samples

---

## Experimentation
- **Concept**:
  - Applying CLA to network intrusions where attackers have code execution
  - Granular behaviors (keystrokes, commands) used in CLA methodology

- **Research Design**:
  - Common approach: use police reports
