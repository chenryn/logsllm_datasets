User: Usually I run python script python myscript.py,
I want to run script directly without type python,
I already Add shebang: #!/usr/bin/env python at the top of my script.
And then give the file permission to execute by: chmod +x SleepCalc.py
but it still tell me "Command not found"
Is anything I need to change in cshell?or anything I did wrong?
Assistant: Are you running it from the same folder using ./SleepCalc.py command?
SleepCalc.pyonly will not work.
