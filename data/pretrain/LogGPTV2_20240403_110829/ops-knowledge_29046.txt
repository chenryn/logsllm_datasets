Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

I usually run my Python script using the command `python myscript.py`. However, I want to be able to run the script directly without typing `python` each time. 

I have already added the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python` at the top of my script. Additionally, I have given the file execute permissions using the command `chmod +x SleepCalc.py`.

Despite these steps, when I try to run the script, I receive the error message "Command not found."

Is there anything specific I need to change in my csh shell configuration? Or did I miss a step?

**Response:**

Are you running the script from the same directory using the `./SleepCalc.py` command? If you simply type `SleepCalc.py`, it will not work. You need to include the `./` prefix to indicate that the script is in the current directory.
