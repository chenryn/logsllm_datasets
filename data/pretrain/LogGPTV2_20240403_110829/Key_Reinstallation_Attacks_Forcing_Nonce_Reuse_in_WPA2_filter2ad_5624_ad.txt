### Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2

#### 4.1 Details of the Group Key Handshake

Networks periodically refresh the group key to ensure that only recently authorized clients possess it. In the most secure scenario, the group key is renewed whenever a client leaves the network. The new group key is distributed using a group key handshake, which has been formally proven to be secure [39]. As shown in Figure 2, the handshake is initiated by the Access Point (AP) when it sends a group message 1 to all clients. The AP retransmits this message if it does not receive an appropriate reply. Note that the EAPOL replay counter of these retransmitted messages is always incremented by one.

In our attack, the goal is to intercept a retransmitted group message 1, block it from reaching the client, and forward it to the client at a later time. This will trick the client into reinitializing the replay counter of the installed group key.

**Prerequisites for the Attack:**

1. **Reinitialization of Replay Counter:**
   - Clients must reinitialize the replay counter when installing an already-in-use group key. Since clients use the MLME-SETKEYS.request primitive to install the group key, this should be the case.
   - We confirmed that in practice, all Wi-Fi clients indeed reinitialize the replay counter of an already-in-use group key (see Table 1, column 7). Therefore, all Wi-Fi clients are vulnerable to our subsequent attacks.

2. **Collection of Acceptable Group Message 1:**
   - We must be able to collect a group message 1 that the client (still) accepts and that contains a group key already in use by the AP. The timing of this depends on when the AP starts using the new group key.
   - The AP may start using the new group key immediately after sending the first group message 1, or it may delay the installation of the group key until all clients have replied with group message 2. Table 2, column 3, summarizes this behavior for various APs.
   - According to the standard, the new group key should be installed after all stations have replied with a group message 2, i.e., the GTK should be installed in a delayed fashion [1, Fig. 12-53].

**Key Reinstallation Attack Scenarios:**

- **Immediate Key Installation:**
  - If the AP immediately installs the group key, the attack is straightforward.
  - **Figure 7** illustrates this attack. The group key handshake messages are encrypted using the data-confidentiality algorithm under the current PTK. On receipt of group message 1, the client installs the new GTK and replies with group message 2.
  - The adversary blocks this message from reaching the AP, causing the AP to retransmit a new group message 1 in stage 2 of the attack.
  - The adversary waits until a broadcast data frame is transmitted and then forwards it to the victim.
  - After this, the retransmitted group message 1 from stage 2 is forwarded to the victim, causing the victim to reinstall the GTK and reinitialize its associated replay counter.
  - This allows the adversary to replay the broadcast data frame (see stage 5), which the client accepts because its replay counter was reinitialized.
  - It is essential that the broadcast frame we replay is sent before the retransmission of group message 1. If it is sent after the broadcast frame, it would contain the updated replay counter and cannot be used to reinitialize the replay counter of the victim.

- **Delayed Key Installation:**
  - If the AP installs the group key in a delayed fashion, the attack becomes more intricate.
  - We will discuss this case in more detail in Section 4.3.

**Group Key Refresh Frequency:**
- Most APs refresh the group key every hour. Some networks even refresh this key whenever a client leaves the network.
- Clients can trigger a group key handshake by sending an EAPOL frame with the Request and Group flags set [1, ยง12.7.7.1].
- Broadcom routers do not verify the authenticity of this message, allowing an attacker to forge it and trigger a group key update.
- Combined, we can assume most networks will eventually execute a group key update, which we can subsequently attack.

#### 4.2 Attacking Immediate Key Installation

**Figure 7** illustrates our key reinstallation attack when the AP immediately installs the group key after sending group message 1 to all clients. The group key handshake messages are encrypted using the data-confidentiality algorithm under the current PTK. On receipt of group message 1, the client installs the new GTK and replies with group message 2. The adversary blocks this message from reaching the AP, causing the AP to retransmit a new group message 1 in stage 2 of the attack.

The adversary waits until a broadcast data frame is transmitted and then forwards it to the victim. After this, the retransmitted group message 1 from stage 2 is forwarded to the victim, causing the victim to reinstall the GTK and reinitialize its associated replay counter. This allows the adversary to replay the broadcast data frame (see stage 5), which the client accepts because its replay counter was reinitialized.

It is essential that the broadcast frame we replay is sent before the retransmission of group message 1. If it is sent after the broadcast frame, it would contain the updated replay counter and cannot be used to reinitialize the replay counter of the victim.

We confirmed this attack in practice for APs that immediately install the group key after sending group message 1 (see Table 2, column 3). Based on our experiments, all Wi-Fi clients are vulnerable to this attack when connected to an AP behaving in this manner.
