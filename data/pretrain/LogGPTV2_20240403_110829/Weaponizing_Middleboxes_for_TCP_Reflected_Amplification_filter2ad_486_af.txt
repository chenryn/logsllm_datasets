### Mitigating TCP-Based Reflected Amplification Attacks

#### 9.1 Middleboxes

**Bidirectional Injection with Condition Checks:**
Middleboxes should only inject block pages if both sides of a connection (client and server) pass through the same middlebox. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to spoof a connection, as they would need to get both sides of a spoofed connection to pass through the same middlebox, which is infeasible. However, this solution is not practical for large-scale middleboxes in transit networks, which often see only one side of a connection.

**Limiting Injected Response Sizes:**
Some middleboxes inject large block pages, enabling significant amplification attacks. A better approach is to respond with a single RST packet to close a forbidden connection or a minimal HTTP redirect to a different server hosting the block page. If the response size is smaller than the minimum required to trigger amplification, the middlebox will not be an effective amplifier.

**Egress Filtering:**
Middleboxes are typically intended to block websites for a specific group (e.g., within a country, corporate, or school network). However, many operate bidirectionally, meaning users outside the network can also trigger injected responses. For example, users outside China can still elicit the Great Firewall of China to inject RST packets. To mitigate this, middleboxes should be configured to only censor requests originating from within the intended network, thereby limiting the scope of potential victims of amplification.

**Removing or Limiting Censorship Devices:**
Many middleboxes inject block pages into censored HTTP requests, using an outdated protocol that has been largely superseded by HTTPS. The utility of these HTTP-injecting devices is diminishing, and their removal is necessary to prevent amplification attacks. Disabling HTTP injection in these devices altogether would prevent their abuse by attackers.

#### 9.2 End Hosts

End hosts can take several steps to mitigate the impact of these attacks:

- **Dropping Outbound RST Packets:**
  Hosts that drop outbound RST packets are more susceptible to TCP handshake-based attacks. Conversely, hosts that do not drop these packets can sustain a packet storm from a victim-sustained amplifier. We recommend configuring end hosts to drop outbound RST packets probabilistically. This approach prevents an infinite packet storm while still offering some protection against handshake-based amplifiers.

### 10. Conclusion

We have presented the first non-trivial TCP-based reflected amplification attacks. To discover them, we used a novel genetic algorithm trained directly against censoring middleboxes. Our scans of the Internet revealed over 200 million IPv4 addresses that provide amplification ranging from 1x to over 700,000x, with some effectively yielding infinite amplification.

Through a series of follow-up experiments, we found that these TCP amplifiers are predominantly middleboxes, often associated with nation-state censorship. It is well-known that nation-state censors restrict open communication within their borders; our work shows that they also pose a significant threat to the broader Internet, as attackers can weaponize their powerful infrastructures to launch DoS attacks on anyone.

Our results highlight that middleboxes introduce an unexpected and untapped threat that attackers could leverage to launch powerful DoS attacks. Protecting the Internet from these threats will require concerted efforts from middlebox manufacturers and operators. To assist in these efforts, we have made our code publicly available at:
