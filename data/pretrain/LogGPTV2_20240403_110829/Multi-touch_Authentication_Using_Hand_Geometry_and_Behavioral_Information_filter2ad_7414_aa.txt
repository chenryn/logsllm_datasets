Abstract—In  this  paper  we  present  a  simple  and  reliable 
authentication method for mobile devices equipped with multi-
touch screens such as smart phones, tablets and laptops. Users 
are authenticated by performing specially designed multi-touch 
gestures with one swipe on the touchscreen. During this process, 
both  hand  geometry  and  behavioral  characteristics  are 
recorded in the multi-touch traces and used for authentication. 
By  combining  both  geometry  information  and  behavioral 
characteristics,  we  overcome  the  problem  of  behavioral 
variability  plaguing  many  behavior  based  authentication 
techniques – which often leads to less accurate authentication or 
poor user experience – while also ensuring the discernibility of 
different users with possibly similar handshapes. We evaluate 
the  design  of  the  proposed  authentication  method  thoroughly 
using  a  large  multi-touch  dataset  collected  from  161  subjects 
with  an  elaborately  designed  procedure  to  capture  behavior 
variability.  The  results  demonstrate  that  the  fusion  of 
behavioral information with hand geometry features produces 
effective resistance to behavioral variability over time while at 
the  same  time  retains  discernibility.  Our  approach  achieves 
EER  of  5.84%  with  only  5  training  samples  and  the 
performance is further improved to EER of 1.88% with enough 
training. Security analyses are also conducted to demonstrate 
that  the  proposed  method 
is  resilient  against  common 
smartphone  authentication  threats  such  as  smudge  attack, 
shoulder  surfing  attack  and  statistical  attack.  Finally,  user 
acceptance of the method is illustrated via a usability study.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The  convenience  of  smartphones  coupled  with  its 
increasing  functions  (e.g.,  provided  by  various  APPs)  has 
enabled users to collect and store various kinds of data, much 
of  which  are  highly  personal  or  sensitive  such  as  photos, 
emails, phone call logs, chat messages, location traces or even 
confidential business documents, and access them at anytime 
and anywhere. As they are carried nearly everywhere we go, 
smartphones are also prone to be lost or stolen, or subject to 
unwanted  access.  Securing  mobile  devices  such  as  smart 
phones  against  unauthorized  access  is  therefore  critical  in 
protecting  user’s  personal  data  and  privacy.  The  most

common authentication approach for smart phones is to use a 
PIN or pattern lock when reactivating the screen. However, 
such  an  approach  is  vulnerable  to  shoulder  surfing  [1]  and 
smudge attacks [2]. 
Biometric authentication is a common approach that has 
been  adopted  for  addressing  this  issue.  Under  such  an 
approach,  a  person 
is  authenticated  using  either  her 
physiological  information  (i.e.,  physiological  biometrics) 
which  is  stable  and  relatively  accurate,  or  behavioral 
characteristics (behavioral biometrics) which may vary over 
time.  The  most  popular  physiological  biometrics  used  for 
smartphone authentication is fingerprint. This requires special 
hardware (fingerprint sensor) installed on smartphone (as well 
as software and license fee), thus incurs additional cost and is 
not universally available on all smartphones. As fingerprint is 
often  used  for  other  purposes  (in  particular,  by  law 
enforcement),  many  users  are  reluctant  to  use  fingerprint 
authentication;  compromising  fingerprint  data  stored  in 
smartphones could also have severe implications. In addition, 
many current deployments of fingerprint still incorporate the 
password  mechanism  (e.g.,  TouchID)  and  researchers  have 
shown that smartphone fingerprint sensors can be fooled with 
a clay finger [3].  
Behavioral  biometrics 
leverage  people’s  operational 
habits  and  preferences  as  identity  information,  such  as  gait 
recognition  [4-6],  keystroke  dynamics  [7-11]  and  gesture 
based authentication [12-14]. A behavioral biometrics-based 
authentication typically employs touch screen and/or sensors 
such as accelerometer and gyroscope that are part of most of 
today’s  smartphones 
to  measure  a  user’s  behavior 
characteristics  (e.g.,  gesture,  keystroke  or  gait)  for  user 
verification or identification. Hence no additional hardware is 
needed. Unfortunately, it has been shown [12,14,15] that all 
existing behavioral biometrics-based authentication methods 
suffer  a  crucial  problem:  users’  behavioral  variability  is 
uncontrollable,  which  causes  an  evident  and  inevitable

also  applied  to  other  mobile  devices  equipped  with  multi-
touch screens such as tablets and touch-screen laptops. The

physiological 
information of hand geometry with behavioral characteristics 
by  a  specific  set  of  multi-touch  gestures  performed  on  the 
touch screen. Both hand geometry information and behavioral 
characteristics (such as the touch pattern, area, time, pressure, 
etc.) are recorded and used for user authentication. The TFST 
gestures  are  designed  to  be  natural  and  easy-to-perform  by 
common smartphone users. By asking a user to perform multi-
touch operations with fingers straight and together, she must 
stretch her fingers and put them together to perform a multi-
touch gesture, with her hand posture conforming to a fixed 
hand  geometry.  As  a  result,  this  produces  a  more  stable 
behavioral pattern, thereby significantly reducing behavioral 
variability  plaguing  existing  behavioral  biometrics  based 
authentication methods. The TFST gestures also require much 
less touch area than existing multi-touch operations proposed 
in  the  literature.  Hence  multi-touch  authentication  can  be 
deployed on smart phones and mobile devices with smaller 
screens. Another advantage of TFST gestures is that they only 
require 0.75s in average to perform. As Harbach et al. showed 
that  mobile  authentication  solutions  lasting  longer  than  2 
seconds are unlikely to be used, given the frequency of daily 
phone unlocks [16]. 
To investigate the performance of the proposed gestures in 
multi-touch authentication, we recruit 161 subjects and collect 
their multi-touch behaviors over 2 months to establish a large 
multi-touch authentication dataset. The collection procedure 
is  designed  to  guarantee  that  the  behavioral  variances  are 
recorded  in  the  dataset.  Using  this  dataset,  we  conduct  an 
extensive  evaluation  of  our  approach  by  analyzing  its 
performance  with  respect  to different  gestures,  feature  sets, 
classifiers and sizes of training sets. Utilizing the long-term 
behavioral  data  collected  in  our  dataset,  we  also  perform  a 
thorough examination of the behavioral variability of TFST 
multi-touch  gestures  and 
impact  on  authentication 
performance. Furthermore, we carry out a security analysis of 
our  multi-touch  authentication  method  under  four  common 
types of attacks. Lastly, we investigate user acceptance of the 
method with a usability study.

B.  Contributions 
below: 
The  major  contributions  of  this  paper  are  summarized 
•  We  propose  a  simple,  fast,  reliable  and  secure 
authentication method based on a set of TFST gestures 
for smartphones and mobile devices equipped with a 
multi-touch screen. By asking a user to perform multi-
touch operations with fingers straight and together, we 
established a close correspondence between the multi-
touch traces and hand geometry. This makes features 
in multi-touch gestures more stable and the behavioral 
variability can be largely reduced. 
•  We  design  a  set  of  TFST  authentication  gestures  in 
accordance with their ease of performing on screens of 
different  sizes,  and  examine  their  accuracies  for

authentication.  Extensive  experiments  show  that,  on 
5”  or  larger  screens,  the  “4-finger  L  swipe”  multi-
touch gesture is able to produce an EER (Equal Error 
Rate)  of  5.84%  with  only  5  training  samples  and  a 
better EER of 1.88% with enough training; while on 
smaller 4” screens, a simple “3-finger vertical swipe” 
gesture  produces  an  EER  of  4.10%  with  sufficient 
number  of  training  samples.  This  provides  more 
options  for  mobile  users  in  search  for  a  tradeoff 
between security and usability. 
•  We  create  a  large  multi-touch  dataset  from  161 
subjects  with  an  elaborately  designed  procedure  to 
guarantee  that  behavior  variability  over  time  is 
captured. 
•  We also perform a thorough examination of behavioral 
variability of TFST gestures and their impact on multi-
touch  authentication  by  utilizing  the  long-term  data 
collected.  The  results  show  that  the  fusion  of 
behavioral  characteristics  with  hand  geometry 
information leads to effective resistance to behavioral 
variability over time. 
•  We carry out security analysis of our proposed multi-
touch  authentication  under  four  common  types  of 
attacks  and  perform  a  usability  study  to  understand 
user acceptance of the proposed method. 
The remainder of paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II we present the design goals and the threat model. Section 
III  describes  the  gesture  design,  feature  definition  and  data 
collection  process.  In  Section  IV  and  V,  we  analyze  the 
features  and  introduce  the  classifiers  for  authentication.  In 
Section VI we describe the evaluation framework and discuss 
the experimental results in Section VII. In Sections VIII and 
IX  we  present  the  security  analysis  and  usability  study, 
respectively.  In  Section  X  we  provide  a  brief  overview  of 
related work, and discuss the strengths and limitation of the 
proposed method and future work in Section XI. The paper is 
concluded in Section XII. 
II.  DESIGN GOALS AND THREAT MODEL 
In  this  paper  we  aim  to  develop  a  local,  usable  and 
(sufficiently)  secure  authentication  method 
to  protect 
everyday  usage  of  smartphones  specifically.  The  proposed 
method  can  also  be  used  to  protect  other  mobile  devices 
equipped with a multi-touch screen such as tablets and touch-
screen laptops. Studies [17-19] have shown that smartphones 
have  very  different  usage  patterns  from  conventional 
computer systems. They are used frequently (on the average, 
more  than  50  times  a  day)  and  often  for  a  short  duration. 
Hence  usability  is  a  key  requirement  for  secure  user 
authentication  on  mobile  devices  such  as  smart  phones.  A 
secure  but  inconvenient  authentication  mechanism  will  be 
quickly disabled by most of the users. 
A.  Design Goals 
Taking both security and usability into account, we design 
a  novel  multi-touch  authentication  method  that  meets  the 
following design goals: 
1.  Simple,  usable  and  universally  applicable:  The 
authentication  process  should  be  easy-to-use,  fast  and

convenient. It should not incur too much cognitive loads on 
the user. The method should be deployable on most mobile 
target devices without requiring installation of new hardware 
components. 
2. Reliable: The method should be capable of verifying the 
legitimacy  of  a  user  with  high  accuracy.  Its  performance 
should not deteriorate with the elapse of time. 
3.  (Sufficiently)  Secure:  The  method  should  be  able  to 
protect  a  user’s  smartphones  for  daily  usage  and  secure  it 
against  unwanted  authentication  attempts  by  a  random 
stranger,  an  acquaintance  or  a  friend,  e.g.,  when  the 
smartphone is left unattended, lost or stolen. In the following, 
we will elaborate on the assumptions about the adversary and 
threat model.  
B.  Assumptions about the Adversary and Threat Model 
As  smart  phones  are  frequently  used  by  users,  in 
“insecure”  environments,  e.g.,  on  a  crowded  bus  where  a 
stranger  can  observe  a  user  unlocks  her  phone,  or  left 
unattended  in  the office. They  are  also  prone  to  get lost or 
stolen. To secure smartphones for daily usage, we assume that 
the  adversary  could  be  someone  who  has  no  personal 
knowledge  of  the  user  but  somehow  has  access  to  her 
smartphone, or  someone  who  may  interact  with  the  user  in 
certain settings and has the opportunity to observe her phone 
unlocks or have access to her phone immediately afterwards. 
In other words, we do not assume that the adversary has the 
power to produce an apparatus (e.g., an artificial hand, or the 
user’s twin sister) with the exact same hand geometry while 
also  being  able  to  observe  and  replicate  the  behavior 
characteristics (hand gestures with the same touch trace and 
pressure).  In  particular,  our  method  is  designed  to  secure 
against the following common types of attacks: 
1.  Zero-effort  Attack:  The  attacker  tries  to  pass  the 
authentication by chance without any knowledge of the inputs 
of the legitimate user during authentication. 
2. Smudge Attack: The attacker utilizes the oily traces left 
on  the  screen  as  a  hint  to  guess  the  secret  to  pass  the 
authentication. 
3.  Shoulder  Surfing  Attack:  The  attacker  watches  the 
authentication process of a legitimate user and acquires useful 
hints of the hand gesture to pass the authentication. 
4.  Statistical  Attack:  The  attacker  employs  knowledge 
obtained  from  the  statistics  of  a  group  of  users  as  hints  to 
generate authentication attempts. 
III.  GESTURE DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION 
  Multi-touch enabled touchscreens have become a standard 
configuration  for  most  tablets  and  phones.  Multi-touch 
enabled laptops and monitors will also become more and more 
popular.  Besides  the  standard  functionality  of  input,  multi-
