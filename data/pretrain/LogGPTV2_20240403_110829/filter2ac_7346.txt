**ATT&CK ID:** T0860  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Wireless Compromise

Adversaries may compromise wireless networks to gain unauthorized access and establish communication channels. This can be achieved by compromising a wireless device or by using radios and other wireless communication devices operating on the same frequency as the target network. Wireless compromise is often used as an initial access vector, allowing adversaries to infiltrate a network from a remote location.
