## Preface
My name is Royce Davis, and I am a professional hacker, red teamer, penetration tester, and offensive security expert. Over the past decade, I have provided adversarial emulation services to a wide range of clients across various industries. The internal network penetration test (INPT) has consistently been the most sought-after service.

### Overview of INPT
An INPT is a complex engagement where an attacker (played by you) gains physical entry to a corporate office. With only a laptop loaded with hacking tools and no prior knowledge of the company’s network, the attacker aims to penetrate as far as possible into the corporate environment. The primary objective is often to gain complete control of the network. I have conducted hundreds of these engagements for companies ranging from small businesses to Fortune-10 conglomerates.

### Commonalities in Network Configurations
Despite the differences in size and industry, the process of taking over a company's network is surprisingly similar. Whether the target is a bank, a video game company, a chemical plant, or a call center, the networks are configured similarly. Employees use devices to access centralized servers, and the methods for identifying hosts, enumerating services, and discovering security weaknesses remain consistent.

### Purpose of This Book
After years of conducting INPTs, I decided to document my methodology and provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for those new to penetration testing. While there are many training and certification programs, many students still lack the practical skills to conduct a penetration test. This book aims to fill that gap.
