which are used as part of the consensus protocol, and only a
small fraction of the throughput are actual actions. It is worth
noting that the number of “endorsements” should be mostly
constant regardless of the number of transactions, and that if
the number of transactions were to increase enough, the trend
would reverse. We can also clearly see that Tezos has very
regular spikes, with an interval of approximately two to three
days each time. These appear to be payments from bakers to
stakers [14],3 which can arguably be thought to be part of
the consensus. We use the TzKT API4 to find account names
and find that roughly 53% of these “Transaction” actions are
sent by bakers and 6% of the are sent by the Tezos faucet [51].
Endorsements and actions sent by either bakers or the faucet
sums up about 87% of the total number of actions.
XRPL. On XRPL, both successful and unsuccessful trans-
actions are recorded. A successfully executed transaction
executes the command—such as Payment, OfferCreate,
OfferCancel—specified by its initiator, while the only con-
sequence of an unsuccessful transaction is the deduction of
transaction fees from the transaction initiator. Across the
sample period, roughly one tenth of transactions are unsuc-
cessful (Figure 3c), with the most frequently registered er-
rors being PATH_DRY for Payment (insufficient liquidity, hence
“dry”, for specified payment path) and tecUNFUNDED_OFFER
for OfferCreate (no funds for the currency promised to offer
by the offer creator).
Successful transactions primarily consist of Payment
(39.6%) and OfferCreate (59.1%) (Figure 1). The number
of OfferCreate is generally constant across time, but the
number of Payment has a very high variance, with some pe-
riods containing virtually no payments and others having
significant spikes. In Section 5.3, we reveal why most trans-
actions during these high-volume periods are economically
meaningless.
Except for the two spam periods, we observe that
OfferCreate is the most common transaction type. Nonethe-
less, OfferCreate transactions contribute little to the total
volume on XRPL.5 This is because an offer expires if not
fulfilled (fully or partially) before the expiry time defined

5On May 10, 2020, for example, Ripple reported that the 24-hour
XRP ledger trade volume—enabled via OfferCreate transactions—only
accounts for 1% of the total ledger volume, while the payment volume—
enabled via Payment transactions—accounts for 99%.

4.2 Transaction Patterns
To understand better what the major sources of traffic con-
stitute, we analyze the top accounts on EOSIO, Tezos, and
XRPL, and find various transaction patterns.
EOSIO. In Figure 4, we show EOSIO accounts with the
highest number of received actions. We can see that the
eosio.token account, which is the account used to handle
EOS token transfers, is by far the most used account, and
that almost all calls to this account use the transfer ac-
tion. Although EOS transfers are indeed a central part of the
EOSIO ecosystem, more than 99.9% of the transfers shown
are exclusively to and from this EIDOS account. The second
account is a betting website where all the bets are performed
transparently using EOSIO. However, around 80% of the
actions—removetask and log—are bookkeeping, and the ac-
tual betting-related actions such as betrecord represent a
very low percentage of the total number of actions. The third
account is a decentralized exchange and is used to exchange
different assets available on EOSIO. This exchange will be
discussed in Section 5. We could not find information about
the fourth account, but it is very actively sending EOS tokens
to the EIDOS account. Finally, the last account was a pornog-
raphy website which used EOSIO as a payment system. This
account is still the fifth account with the highest number
of received actions although the service was discontinued in
November 2019 for financial reasons [26].
Tezos. As Tezos neither has account names nor actions in the
transactions metadata, analyzing the top receivers’ accounts
is less interesting, as it is very difficult to perform any type

of attribution. However, we find interesting patterns from
observing the top sending accounts. Most of the top senders
in Tezos seem to follow a similar pattern: Sending a small
number of transactions (between 5 and 50) to many different
accounts. Another important thing to note is that all of these
accounts are not contracts but regular accounts, which means
that the transactions are automated by an off-chain program.
After further investigation, we find that the top address is
the Tezos Faucet [51]. The other addresses appear to be
bakers’ payout addresses and the transactions are payouts to
stakers [31], corresponding to the peaks seen in Figure 3b. For
completeness, we include the top senders and some statistics
about them in Figure 5.
XRPL. From October 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, a total
of 195 thousand accounts collectively conducted 272 million
transactions, i.e. an average of 1.4 thousand transactions per
account during the seven-month observation period.
The distribution of the number of transactions per ac-
count is highly skewed. Over one third (71 thousand) of
the accounts have transacted only once during the entire
observation period, whereas the 35 most active accounts
are responsible for half of the total traffic. Figure 6 lists of
the top 10 accounts by the number of conducted transac-
tions. With the exception of rKLpjpCoXgLQQYQyj13zgay73rsgmzNH13
and r96HghtYDxvpHNaru1xbCQPcsHZwqiaENE, all these accounts share
suspiciously similar patterns:
(1) more than 98% of their transactions are OfferCreate;
(2) they are either descendants of an account from Huobi,
a crypto exchange founded in China, or frequently
transact with descendants from Huobi;
∙ Transactions on EOSIO can be roughly divided by the
category of contracts they belong to. Before the ar-
rival of the EIDOS token, approximately 50% of these
are transactions to betting games. The rest was split
(3) they have all transacted using CNY;
(4) their payment transactions conspicuously use the same
destination tag 104398, a field that—similar to a bank
reference number—exchanges and gateways use to spec-
ify which client is the beneficiary of the payment [64].
The aforementioned similarities, in particular the last one,
signal that those accounts are controlled by the same entity,
presumably with a strong connection to Huobi. The frequent
placement of offers might come from the massive client base
of the entity.

Payment transaction during the observation period, while
the rest of the over four million transactions failed with
a PATH_DRY error. Recall that failed transactions still
occupy on-chain throughput. Therefore, it is evident that
chineseyuan spammed the network.

between token transfers and various forms of enter-
tainment, such as games not involving betting as well
as payments to pornography web sites. The launch of
EIDOS increased the total number of transactions more
than tenfold, resulting in 96% of the transactions being
used for token transfers.
∙ The vast majority (76%) of transactions on Tezos are
used by the endorsement operation to maintain con-
sensus. This is due to the fact that blocks typically
contain 32 endorsements [49] and the number of trans-
actions on the network is still low. The rest of the
throughput is mainly used by transactions to transfer
assets between accounts.
∙ OfferCreate and Payment are the two most popu-
lar transaction types on XRPL, accounting for 59.1%
and 36.9% of the total throughput, respectively. Be-
tween October 1, 2019 and October 8, 2019, before
the systematic spamming periods, the fractions of
OfferCreate and Payment are 79% and 18%, respec-
tively. Overall, one tenth of the transactions fail.
Inutile Transactions on EOSIO
5 CASE STUDIES
In this section, we present several case studies of how the
transaction throughput on the three blockchains is used in
practice, for both legitimate and less legitimate purposes.
5.1
Exchange Wash-trading. We investigate WhaleEx, who claims
to be the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on EOSIO
in terms of daily active users [57]. As shown in Figure 4,
the most frequently-used action of the WhaleEx contract
are verifytrade2 and verifytrade3, with a combined total
of 9,437,393 calls over the seven months observational period,
which corresponds to approximately one action every two
seconds. These actions are executed when a buy offer and a
sell offer match each other and signals a settled trade.
Firstly, and most obviously, we notice that in more
than 75% of the trades, the buyer and the seller are the
same. This means that no asset is transferred at the end of
the action. Furthermore, the transaction fees for both the
buyer and the seller are 0, which means that such a trans-
action is achieving absolutely nothing else than artificially
increasing the service statistics, i.e. wash-trading.
Further investigation reveals that accounts involved in
the trades that are signaled by either verifytrade2 or
verifytrade3 are highly concentrated: the top 5 accounts,
as either a “seller” or a “buyer”, are associated with over 78%
of the trades. We compute the percentage of such trans-
actions for the top 5 accounts and find that each of these
accounts acts simultaneously as both seller and buyer in more
than 88% of the transactions they are associated with. This
means that the vast majority of transactions of the top 5
accounts represent wash-trading.
Next, we analyze the amount of funds that has been moved,
i.e. the difference between the total amount of cryptocurrency
sent and received by the same account. For the most active
