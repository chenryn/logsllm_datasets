# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Allow the users to add new languages into terminal, or create "extensions"
like exist in VSCode
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
No problem currently, other than end-user inconvenience. I've downloaded
several different language libraries, and each one comes with their own
console shells. It would be so much easier, and convenient if there were a way
to "link" the terminal app to these other consoles (e.g. python) so that I
could work within one location. I've got compilers and such already downloaded
in VS and VSCode, but if I want to try something basic, I've found console to
be quicker and easier than starting VS
