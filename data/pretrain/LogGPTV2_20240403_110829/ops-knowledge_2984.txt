User: As I have started to use Python 3.4, I need pip to maintain libraries on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.
How to select the appropriate pip quickly using terminal?
Note:
This question is NOT related to Virtualenv but with the default python2.7 and python3.4 that comes with Fedora 22 Workstation. 
As a temporary fix, I am using PyCharm to manage libraries.
Assistant: on fedora 25 you can just do the following:

copy file sudo cp /usr/bin/pip /usr/bin/pip3
then edit it to change #!/usr/bin/python to #!/usr/bin/python3
do pip3 -V to see that works.

this solution can also work on others version of fedora.
