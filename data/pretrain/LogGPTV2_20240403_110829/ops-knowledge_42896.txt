User: I am new to Rundeck, so I apologize if I ask a question that probably has an obvious answer I'm overlooking.
I've installed Rundeck on my Windows PC.  I've got a couple of Python scripts that I want to execute via Rundeck.  
The scripts run fine when I execute them manually.
I created a job in Rundeck, created a single step (script file option) to test the python script.  
The job failed after six seconds.  When I checked the log, it was because it was executing it line by line rather than letting python run it as an entire script.
How do I fix this?
Assistant: okay, so I changed the step type to a command rather than script file and it worked.
I guess my understanding of what a script file is was off.
