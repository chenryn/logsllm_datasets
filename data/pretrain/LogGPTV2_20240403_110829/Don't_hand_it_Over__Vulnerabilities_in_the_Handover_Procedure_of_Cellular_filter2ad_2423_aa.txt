ABSTRACT
Mobility management in the cellular networks plays a significant
role in preserving mobile services with minimal latency while a
user is moving. To support this essential functionality the cellular
networks rely on the handover procedure. Most often, the User
Equipment (UE) provides signal measurements to the network via
reports to facilitate the handover decision when it discovers a more
suitable base station. These measurement reports are cryptographi-
cally protected. In this paper, we examine the cellular specification
and illustrate that this crucial functionality has critical security
implications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on
cellular Man-In-The-Middle attacks based on the handover proce-
dure. In particular, we demonstrate a new type of fake base station
attacks in which the handover procedures, based on the encrypted
measurement reports and signal power thresholds, are vulnerable.
An attacker who sets up a false base station mimicking a legitimate
one can utilize the vulnerabilities in the handover procedure to
cause Denial-Of-Service attacks, Man-In-The-Middle attacks, and
information disclosure affecting the user as well as the operator.
Therefore, users’ privacy and service availability are jeopardized.
Through rigorous experimentation, we uncover the vulnerable parts
of the handover procedure, a comprehensive attacker methodol-
ogy, and attack requirements. We largely focus on the 5G network
showing that handover vulnerabilities remain unmitigated to date.
Finally, we assess the impact of the handover attacks, and carefully
present potential countermeasures that can be used against them.

1 INTRODUCTION
The 5th Generation (5G) of mobile telecommunications is gradually
transforming the world. By the end of 2020 over 1 billion people, or
15 percent of the world’s population, were living in areas with 5G
coverage [25]. 2G and 3G generations are in a process of progres-
sive phaseout, since carriers need to re-use spectrum to enhance
their networks and provide faster, more responsive technology to
their customers. This means that newer networks will rely on the
coexistence between 4G and 5G technologies.
One of the most critical elements of the cellular telecommuni-
cations is the mobility management and a principal part of it is
the handover procedure. Cellular handover in mobile networks is a
mechanism that retains the current session of the mobile terminal
when a transition is required from one radio cell to another. It is
a vital part of the Mobility Management with a goal to maintain
Quality of Service, to not drain the UE battery power, and to pro-
vide service continuity with minimal handover latency. To facilitate
this process, operators and organizations, such as the 3rd Gen-
eration Partnership Project (3GPP), introduced the Measurement
Report (MR), which is a message containing frequency and power
metrics to assist the network on deciding if a handover is necessary
and which is the most suitable handover target station. The UE
sends these messages to the serving base station when required or
instructed. As a consequence, the handover procedure is heavily
dependent on the content of the MR to assess the mobility status
of a UE.
In terms of security, the MR messages are protected by the Access
Stratum (AS) security context. Similarly, exchanged messages dur-
ing a handover procedure are security protected, thus an attacker
cannot manipulate or modify the messages directly. However, the
content of the MR messages are never verified by the network to
prove their legitimacy. Instead, they are considered trusted and
the network proceeds with their evaluation. Consequently, if an
attacker manipulates the content of the MR by including his/her
measurements, then the network will process the bogus measure-
ments. This is possible by imitating a legitimate base station and
replaying its broadcast messages. So, when the UE is in the coverage
area of the attacker, the rogue base station has high enough signal
power to "attract" the UE and trigger a MR, then the attacker has
very good chances of forcing the victim UE to attach to his/her
rogue base station abusing the handover procedure. Once, the UE
is attached to the attacker it could either enter in a camped mode
due to a Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attack and become unresponsive,
or the attacker could establish a Man-In-The-Middle (MitM) relay

building the basis for other advanced exploits. It is noteworthy
that the attack has impact on the network side as well, as we will
elaborate on later.
Recently, Shaik et al. [46] and the 3GPP’s technical report [8]
have briefly tackled handover implications in Self-Organizing Net-
works (SON) [10, 15]. They illustrate the idea that an attacker could
potentially launch successful handover attacks against Long Term
Evolution (LTE)’s X2 and 5G’s Xn handover procedures, respec-
tively. However, both works address this issue with limited levels
of details and rather vague results, and they merely report two han-
dover cases. Furthermore, the two works disagree when it comes to
the Random Access Channel (RACH) completion that is required
during a malicious handover: whether the RACH can be successfully
completed or not.
In this paper, we tackle the fact that the security implications
of the cellular handover are under-explored. We present the first
comprehensive study of vulnerabilities in the cellular handover
procedure. In particular, we explore the security weaknesses of
the handover procedure in the presence of a rogue base station,
we present a comprehensive attack methodology that can impact
the cellular network in various ways, we experiment thoroughly
to uncover the extent of affected handover cases, and reveal what
types of attacks are feasible. In conclusion, we discuss potential
detection and prevention handover countermeasures.
(3) We perform an experimental validation for 4G (LTE), 5G
Non-Standalone and 5G Standalone handover cases, where
we evaluate the Intra- and Inter-Base station handovers and
provide a detailed description of the experimental setup,
the exact attack steps needed, and the achieved results. In
addition, we describe and interpret the behavior of the UE
and the network during a handover exploitation, taking into
account a diverse range of cellular services and UE models.
(4) We specifically show that handover exploitation can lead
to MitM attacks and sensitive data extraction, such as IMSI,
apart from the usual DoS attacks. Furthermore, we clarify the
impact of such attacks on the UE as well as on the network.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study on the
security of the handover procedure presenting experimental results
for 5G from an advanced 5G Standalone and Non-Standalone setup.
Finally, we have discussed the vulnerability disclosure with
GSMA as our work was submitted under the assigned tracking
number CVD-2021-0051. GSMA is planning to use our results to
improve the existing 3GPP specifications, remedy any inaccuracies
and bolster 3GPP’s security study against false base stations.
In more details, our contributions are as follows:
(1) We present a comprehensive security study on the handover
procedure evaluating different handover types and present-
ing their similarities in terms of security. As far as we know,
this is also the first study that investigates rogue base station
effects on handover security in such depth.
(2) We demonstrate that vulnerabilities in the handover pro-
cedure are not limited to one handover case only but they
impact all different handover cases and scenarios that are
based on unverified measurement reports and signal strength
thresholds. We also illustrate that the problem affects all gen-
erations since 2G (GSM), remaining unsolved so far.

2 PRELIMINARIES: MOBILE HANDOVER
Normally, the UE collects radio measurements based on two states:
idle and connected. In idle state mode, the measurements are used
for cell selection and cell re-selection. In connected state mode, the
measurements are used for handover and redirection scenarios. In
general, the UE is instructed to occasionally transmit measurement
report messages to its source/serving base station.
Measurement reports consist of collected power and frequency
measurements about proximal base stations. All the necessary in-
formation needed for the UE to conduct the measurements are
accessible through the broadcasted System Information Block (SIB)
and Master Information Block (MIB) messages of the base station.
Upon receiving the messages, the serving base station evaluates
them and decides if a handover procedure is necessary. In particular,
if the link to the serving cell is getting degraded and/or another
reported neighboring cell at a different frequency is getting better
than the serving cell, the network may possibly move the mobile
terminal connection from the serving cell to that neighboring cell,
so the mobile terminal will get better radio conditions and con-
sequently the operator will offer a greater user experience. This
decision is actually based on mathematical calculations involving
a triggering threshold [2, 3, 6, 18] that corresponds to an Event.
Therefore, if the UE’s values in the measurement report exceed
the associated threshold, then a handover will be initiated by the
source base station. Additionally, the measurements (RSRP, RSRQ,
SINR etc.) may also facilitate inner-network processes and may be
used for other calculations such as base station resource allocation.
Figure 1 shows the UE’s transition from one base station to another
as the handover procedure takes place.
Trigger Events: The decision whether a mobile device will move
to another station or not is made by the serving base station based
on measurement reports from the mobile device. This holds for any
technology so far (i. e., 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G). In ideal cases, a base station
shall allow UE to report serving cell and neighboring cell signal
