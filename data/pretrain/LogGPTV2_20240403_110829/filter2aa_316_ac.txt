# Database Abstraction Layer: Stdout
- **Description**: The ultimate database abstraction layer.
- **Functionality**:
  - Enables data insertion into multiple databases.
  - The API does not need to be linked with `scanrand` as a client.
  - Works over SSH.
- **Limitations**:
  - Not suitable for report generation.
  - **Security Concerns**: Passing raw SQL can lead to injection attacks. Consider locally parsing packets into SQL for untrusted servers.

# State Reconstruction Strategies
- **Generic Model (Example: OS Fingerprinting)**:
  - **Objective**: Identify a set of packets that elicits uniquely identifiable hosts.
  - **Methods**:
    - Nmap algorithm.
    - New xprobe work from Ofir Arkin.
    - Temporal fingerprinting.
  - **Process**:
    - Insert scan configuration into a table.
    - Compare scan results to the scan configuration.
    - **Scenarios**:
      - No replies on host in range: Host is unreachable (includes ICMP Unreachable parsing).
      - Some replies on host in range: Host needs more packets – trigger a retry in the background.
      - All replies on host in range: Compile results into a format assumed by nmap/xprobe, pass the structure to their evaluation routine, and add results to another table.

# TCP Spoofing
- **TCP Spoofing**:
  - **Challenge**: Normally not possible because every packet sent (except the SYN) contains a token from a previously received window.
  - **Tools**: Phentropy + OpenQViz.
  - **Security Implication**: Another node cannot impersonate the server without the token.
  - **Scenario**: If the server sends the token to an impersonator, spoofing becomes possible.

# Bandwidth Brokering
- **Overview**:
  - **Question**: Is it possible for a single host to do load balancing across arbitrary network boundaries without special client code?
  - **Answer**: Yes, by transforming the server into a redirector of client-provided packets and having anonymous servers spoof the source IP of the redirector.
- **Features**:
  - **Global Load Distribution**: Any node that can spoof itself as the redirector can serve clients.
  - **Central Traffic Monitoring**: Each forwarded ACK contains the number of bytes sent by the anonymous server to the client, allowing the redirector to monitor link quality.
  - **Session Migration**: The redirector can forward ACKs to a less overloaded server, maintaining the client's belief that they are receiving packets from the redirector.
  - **Applications**: Suitable for streams like MP3 radio stations and web servers.
  - **Efficiency**: Moving empty ACKs consumes much less bandwidth than payloads.

# Bandwidth Brokering HOWTO
- **Redirector**:
  - **Action**: Upon receiving a packet from the client to the redirected IP/Port, change the destination IP to the redirector, recalculate checksums, and send the packet out the appropriate interface.
  - **Rules**:
    - **Stateless**: TCP Source Port, IP Source (using geo-coding), etc.
    - **Stateful**: Who is moving the least data, who has dropped the fewest packets, etc.
- **Anonymous Server**:
  - **Action**: Before sending a packet with the source port of an anonymous service, change the source IP to that of the redirector, recalculate checksums, and send the packet.
- **Client**:
  - **Action**: Notice the TTL bouncing around as the stream comes from different sources.

# SSL vs. IDS: The Eternal Conflict
- **SSL**:
  - **Function**: Encrypts network traffic between trusted and untrusted entities, blinding all watchers except the endpoint.
  - **Security Concerns**: Certificate compromise can be extremely damaging, leading to loss of past and future data.
- **IDS**:
  - **Function**: Monitors network traffic between trusted and untrusted entities, watching for attacks.
  - **Challenges**: Can be bypassed by encrypted traffic, making it difficult to detect active attacks.
- **Conflict**:
  - **Choice**: Suppress passive monitoring and suffer active attacks, or suppress active attacks and suffer passive monitoring.
  - **Certificate Transfer**:
    - **Option**: IDS gets a copy of the certificate.
    - **Drawbacks**: Violates the first law of private keys, adds RSA decryption load to the IDS, and can be exploited by switching to SSL2.
  - **Inline SSL Accelerators**:
    - **Setup**: IDS lives between the accelerator and the server farm.
    - **Issues**: IDS is vulnerable to DoS attacks, HTTP rewriting issues, and plaintext on the wire.
  - **Selective Centralized Monitoring**:
    - **Approach**: Transfer just the encryption key from the client to the server to the IDS, allowing it to monitor traffic without intercepting secure content.
    - **Benefits**: IDS doesn't need to perform RSA, can disauthorize traffic, and can read traffic after sensitive exchanges.
  - **Plaintext Forwarding over Encrypted Tunnel**:
    - **Method**: Forward messages from the user, optionally asking if a response is needed.
    - **Advantages**: Adds latency, high bandwidth, no need to interface with the crypto engine, and can be built into web applications.
    - **Disadvantage**: Less cool.

# Generic ActiveX Encapsulation
- **Question**: Is it possible to use ActiveX to deploy something other than spyware without writing custom applications/wrappers?
- **Answer**: Yes, any Win32 application (any .EXE file) can be cryptographically signed and used instead of a genuine ActiveX object.
- **Details**:
  - Object GUID is not checked; code only needs to be self-signed.
  - Applications requiring multiple files need a CAB containing all necessary files and an INF file describing which executable to launch.
- **Examples**: Putty, OpenSSH, etc.
- **Demo**: Available at [http://www.doxpara.com/apps](http://www.doxpara.com/apps)
