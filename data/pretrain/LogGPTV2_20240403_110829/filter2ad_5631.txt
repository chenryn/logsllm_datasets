INTRODUCTION
When a new technology reaches the market, we often fo-
cus on the want or need that it can fulﬁll. However, as the
market for a technology matures, reliability often becomes a
key diﬀerentiating factor between competing products. Ex-
amples of this abound, from cars to passenger ﬂights, phones
and televisions.
Broadband bandwidth capacities remain a challenge around
the world.
In the developed world, however, their rapid
growth seems to have already passed current needs. Fig-
ure 1 shows how peak network usage (95th percentile hour)
changes with growing bandwidth capacity (measured from
over 7000 residential gateways in the US). We observe a law
of diminishing returns in their relationship: the relative in-
crease in demand is greater for lower capacity than for the
larger capacity connections. At about 12 Mbps, most users
95th percentile usage remains below 15% of their capacity.
In this poster, we posit that in the developed world broad-
band reliability will soon become the dominant feature for
service comparison. With increased capacity, a growing
number of consumers switch their cable TV and landline
phone subscription to video streaming or VoIP services over
the Internet. For such users, service uptime becomes a seri-
ous concern. While previous outages resulted in mild incon-
veniences while browsing the web, today’s network availabil-
ity can determine the outcome of an emergency situation.
Previous works on broadband networks have focused on
characterizing performance [1, 4], and works on reliability
typically study wireless networks (cellular, WiFi, WiMax,

etc). In this poster, we use data collected from residential
gateways (via FCC/SamKnows) and end-hosts (via Name-
help) to study the availability and reliability of ﬁxed-line
broadband networks. We use traditional metrics (e.g. failure
rate, MTBF, MTTR) to quantify each broadband service.
We study the reliability of DNS, a service typically provided
by ISPs. Using natural experiments, we look at the impact
that increased network downtime has on user demand. Also,
we note the severity of an outage largely depends on when
it occurs (e.g. time of the day, day of the week). As a re-
sult, we use typical network usage patterns to design a new
metric for service reliability, the average expected traﬃc lost
(AETL), to quantify the impact of each service’s outages.
2. APPROACH
In this work, we leverage two datasets. First, we use data
provided by the FCC [2], collected from gateways distributed
to ﬁxed-line broadband customers in the US. In our study,
we use measurements of packet loss rates to M-Lab hosted
measurement servers, DNS lookup failures, and byte coun-
ters of traﬃc over the WAN interface. Each of these are
recorded at hour intervals. We consider an access link to be
down when packet loss rates are above 10% for the hour.
Our end-host collected dataset comes from namehelp [3],
a tool for improving DNS performance. We designed and
deployed an extension for monitoring users’ access links (at
30-second intervals) and ISP DNS servers, measuring ser-
vice availability. In addition to providing more ﬁne-grained
information, this also gives us access to a diverse set of users
(over 20,000 clients in 115 countries).

3. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
Our preliminary analysis has produced a number of in-
teresting results. Below we provide a brief summary of our
current ﬁndings.
First, we studied how service reliability was aﬀected by
the technology employed. Figure 2 shows the mean time be-
tween failure (MTBF), averaged for each technology. Over-
all, ﬁber services were by far the most reliable, with about
1600 hours (or about 67 days) between service outages. Next
were DSL and cable services, with similar averages. Wire-
less services (such as Clearwire) and satellite services were
the least reliable services, with less than 100 hours between
failures.
Although DSL services had a higher MTBF than cable, we
found that network outages in cable networks were typically
more likely to occur during oﬀ-peak hours (i.e. in the middle
of the night, between 2 and 4 am local time or in the early
afternoon). In contrast, outages in DSL services were either
uniformly distributed across the day or concentrated during
peak usage hours.
With this in mind, we also want to compare services by
the severity of their outages. To do this, we calculate the
“typical” (median) demand at each hour of the day, for each
day of the week, for all users, shown in Fig. 3 (Monday
through Friday are grouped together as they showed similar
usage patterns). This gives us an idea of how the impact
of service outages diﬀer on user traﬃc. For each service
outage that we ﬁnd, we use the “typical” number of bytes
during that hour to estimate the volume of aﬀected traﬃc.
Figure 4: Average packet loss rate in each state ver-
sus the average urban-area population density.
We average this across all users to calculate the expected
number of bytes of traﬃc lost, giving us an idea of the impact
of each outage.
In this analysis, we found that outages on DSL services
were typically more severe than in cable services. Also, we
found that both cable and DSL services had similar mean
times to recovery. The diﬀerence was largely due to diﬀer-
ences in when the outages occurred. Therefore, despite the
lower MTBF, we believe that cable networks in the US will
tend to be perceived as more reliable.
We also investigated how service availability related to ge-
ographic settings. Since we only have course-grained (state)
geographic information for users in the FCC/SamKnows
dataset, we used census data from 2010 to ﬁnd the fraction of
the population in each state living in urban areas. Figure 4
shows the average packet loss rate in each state by the pop-
ulation density in urban regions of that state. For the most
part, states with a lower urban population density tended
to have higher packet loss rates rates. We expect that this
is either due to the wider use of less reliable technologies, or
that the implementations themselves are less reliable, as the
have to cover greater distances. We are studying this, and
other aspect of service reliability and availability in greater
detail in our ongoing work.
