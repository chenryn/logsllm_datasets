  * VSCode Version:  
1.1.1
  * OS Version:  
RHEL 7.2
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. type `Ctrl+P` and `ext install csharp`
  2. The status bar at the left bottom remains "installing" status. It doesn' t finish for several hours.
I get into this situation only csharp extension. I can install other
extensions such as go, python.  
I have a workaround that I install csharp extension other Linux distro machine
and copy ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.csharp-1.0.11 to RHEL machine.  
However, I'd like to know the root cause. Could you help me?
