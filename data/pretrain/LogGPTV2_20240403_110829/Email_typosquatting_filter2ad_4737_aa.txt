## Abstract
While website domain typosquatting is a significant annoyance for legitimate domain operators, research indicates that it rarely poses a major risk to individual users. However, any application (e.g., email, FTP) that relies on the domain name system for name resolution is equally vulnerable to domain typosquatting, with potentially more severe consequences.

This paper presents the first in-depth measurement study of email typosquatting. In collaboration with our Institutional Review Board (IRB), we registered 76 typosquatting domain names to study a wide variety of user mistakes while minimizing the exposure of personal information. Over seven months, we received millions of emails at our registered domains. While most of these were spam, we estimate that each year, three of our domains should receive approximately 3,585 "legitimate" emails intended for others. Our analysis of a small sample of these emails revealed that they may contain sensitive information, such as visa documents or medical records.

We project that 1,211 typosquatting domains registered by unknown entities receive around 800,000 emails annually. Additionally, we found that millions of registered typosquatting domains have MX records pointing to only a few mail servers. A second experiment involving "honey emails" showed limited evidence of attempts at credential theft, suggesting that the threat, for now, remains theoretical.

## 1. Introduction
Domain typosquatting involves registering a domain name very similar to an existing, legitimate domain to capture some of the traffic intended for the original domain. This practice exploits the tendency of users to make typographical errors when typing domain names, often for financial gain. For example, someone registering `gooogle.com` would receive traffic meant for `google.com`, which could then be monetized through ads or drive-by-downloads.

In some jurisdictions, domain typosquatting is illegal and can lead to trademark infringement cases. In 1999, ICANN, the authority regulating domain names, created the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) to address such issues.

Most studies have focused on web typosquatting, but domain typosquatting can also target other applications like SSH, FTP, and email. This paper is the first in-depth study of email typosquatting, where miscreants register domain names mimicking those of large email providers to intercept emails. Even though typing mistakes may be rare, typosquatting a large email provider (e.g., `gmail.com`) can be profitable due to the high volume of emails. While most intercepted emails might be of limited use, some could contain sensitive information, leading to significant gains for attackers and losses for victims.

To test this hypothesis, we registered 76 email typosquatting domains, collected data for over seven months (June 4, 2016–January 15, 2017), and designed a protocol with our IRB to process the emails. We found that several actors already have the infrastructure for bulk email domain typosquatting. Our regression analysis suggests that setting up the necessary infrastructure costs only a few cents per email, and attackers can expect to receive hundreds of thousands of emails over a few months. However, our "honey emails" containing credentials showed that, despite many being accepted, they were not read, indicating that email typosquatting is not currently monetized.

## 2. Related Work
Our work builds on the extensive research in online crime measurements, particularly focusing on domain typosquatting and its economic effects. Most studies have concentrated on web typosquatting, which targets users making mistakes while typing URLs. Edelman's 2003 case study [17] was one of the first to examine a single typosquatter who registered thousands of domains. Subsequent efforts proposed methods to detect and differentiate typosquatting domains [13–15, 31].

Monetization strategies for typosquatting include domain parking, where empty web pages are monetized with advertisements. Moore and Edelman [24] discussed the use of Google AdWords to select typosquatting domains, and Agten et al. [11] provided a longitudinal study of monetization strategies. Khan et al. [22] quantified the harm of typosquatting, finding that a typical user loses 1.3 seconds on average when visiting a typosquatting domain.

Our work broadens the scope to email typosquatting, which shares technical similarities with web typosquatting but has different monetization strategies. While web typosquatting profits from advertisements, email typosquatting benefits from capturing credentials or sensitive information. To our knowledge, only one white paper [19] has looked at domain typosquatting beyond the web, but it lacks detailed data on the number of domains and spam filtering. Our work provides a more comprehensive picture of email typosquatting in the wild.

## 3. Terminology
Typosquatting involves several concepts:

- **Distance Metrics:** We use Damerau-Levenshtein distance (minimum number of operations to transform one string into another) and fat-finger distance (minimum number of insertions, deletions, substitutions, or transpositions using adjacent QWERTY keyboard letters). Visual distance measures how different mistyped characters look compared to the original.
- **Typosquatting Domains:** Target domain names are those targeted by typosquatters. Generated typo domains ("gtypos") are lexically similar to target domains, candidate typo domains ("ctypos") are registered gtypos, and typosquatting domains are ctypos registered to benefit from traffic intended for a target domain.
- **Misdirected Email Taxonomy:** Receiver typo emails are sent to the wrong address due to a mistyped domain. Reflection typo emails result from users mistyping their email address during registration, leading to misdirected service emails. SMTP typo emails occur when users mistype their SMTP settings, causing all sent emails to be intercepted.

## 4. In the Shoes of a Typosquatter
We conducted a seven-month experiment (June 4, 2016–January 15, 2017) to understand the potential impact of email typosquatting. By registering typosquatting domains, we counted the number of emails received and analyzed the types of typos. Ethical considerations were paramount, and we worked with our IRB to minimize risks. We agreed to surrender any domain upon request and implemented strict data protection measures, including encrypted storage and automatic removal of sensitive information. Despite receiving millions of emails, most were spam. A small sample of non-spam emails was manually analyzed to evaluate our spam classifier, ensuring no risk to users.
