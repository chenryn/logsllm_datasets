## Summary
We would like to have a paramaterized role to configure a service and have a
handler that restarts the service using parameters that are passed into the
role.
A real world example is a role that installs supervisor that takes a path to a
virtual environment and config parameters as parameters. In that case we want
to notify a restart on the service using the parameters for each time it is
called. This seems to work ok in 1.3, it breaks in 1.4.
## Simple example to illustrate the issue:
test/tasks/main.yml:
    - shell: echo "test - {{ test_param }}"
      notify: test handler
test/handlers/main.yml:
    - name: test handler
      debug: msg="handler {{ test_param }}"
play:
    - hosts: all
      roles:
        - { role: test, test_param: "first call to test" }
        - { role: test, test_param: "second call to test" }
### ansible 1.3 output:
_This seems to work as expected_
    TASK: [shell echo "test - first call to test"] ******************************** 
    changed: [localhost]
    TASK: [shell echo "test - second call to test"] ******************************* 
    changed: [localhost]
    NOTIFIED: [test handler] ****************************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {"item": "", "msg": "handler first call to test"}
    NOTIFIED: [test handler] ****************************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {"item": "", "msg": "handler second call to test"}
### ansible-playbook 1.4 (devel `f347133`) output:
_Note that only the handler was triggered only once for the first call. This
can be an issue when you call a role with parameters where one of the
parameters is used in the notifier (such as a service configuration file
location, and a restart handler)_
    TASK: [test | shell echo "test - first call to test"] ************************* 
    changed: [localhost]
    TASK: [test | shell echo "test - second call to test"] ************************ 
    changed: [localhost]
    NOTIFIED: [test | test handler] *********************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "item": "", 
        "msg": "handler first call to test"
    }
Changing test/tasks/main.yml to flush its handlers seems to have issues in
both versions:
test/tasks/main.yml:
    - shell: echo "test - {{ test_param }}"
      notify: test handler
    - meta: flush_handlers
### ansible 1.3:
_Note that both handlers for both parameters are flushing twice._
    TASK: [shell echo "test - first call to test"] ******************************** 
    changed: [localhost]
    NOTIFIED: [test handler] ****************************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {"item": "", "msg": "handler first call to test"}
    NOTIFIED: [test handler] ****************************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {"item": "", "msg": "handler second call to test"}
    TASK: [shell echo "test - second call to test"] ******************************* 
    changed: [localhost]
    NOTIFIED: [test handler] ****************************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {"item": "", "msg": "handler first call to test"}
    NOTIFIED: [test handler] ****************************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {"item": "", "msg": "handler second call to test"}
### ansible 1.4 (devel `f347133`) output:
_In this case when the second call to test.yml flushes its handler it uses the
first definition of`{{ test_param }}`, not the second._
    TASK: [test | shell echo "test - first call to test"] ************************* 
    changed: [localhost]
    NOTIFIED: [test | test handler] *********************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "item": "", 
        "msg": "handler first call to test"
    }
    TASK: [test | shell echo "test - second call to test"] ************************ 
    changed: [localhost]
    NOTIFIED: [test | test handler] *********************************************** 
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "item": "", 
        "msg": "handler first call to test"
    }
