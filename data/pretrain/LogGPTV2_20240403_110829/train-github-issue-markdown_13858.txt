Main page - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/, pressing the big "Download
Bootstrap" gives you everything.
Going to customize - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html
(specifically Responsive layouts)
Having everything checked, scrolling to the bottom, and downloading - doesn't
give you bootstrap-responsive.css
Wondering why all my menus were going nuts. Thanks!
