User: I would like to know the difference in 

installing Python, Paramiko packages in Cygwin and
Python is already installed in my Windows PC. I have installed Cygwin too (but without Python package) and in Cygwin terminal I do the following:
$echo "PATH=\$PATH:/cygdrive/c/Python27" >> .bash_profile
then,
source .bash_profile (after doing this I am able to run a Python script from cygwin terminal). 

If the steps in point number 2 works good, then still do I need to install python packages from a Cygwin mirror site ? If I have not done it, then what I might miss while running Python through Cygwin ?
Thanks for your help.
Assistant: No, you don't need to do so. In fact, CYGWIN will inherit the PC's PATH, plus with virtual PATH, you can input "echo $PATH" in CYGWIN and input "PATH" and the windows console, you could find that CYGWIN has more PATH setting than the windows.  However, as you already overwrite the bash_profile, so it might not looks as what I said.
Besides, the most significant difference is that most of the CYGWIN executable files depends on CYGWIN.dll, while the typically windows files don't.
