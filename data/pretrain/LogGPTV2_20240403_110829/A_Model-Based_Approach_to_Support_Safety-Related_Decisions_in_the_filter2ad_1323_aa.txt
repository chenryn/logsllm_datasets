## Abstract
Accidents in petroleum installations can have severe consequences. To mitigate these risks, multiple safety barriers are implemented. However, faults and unexpected events can cause these barriers to deviate from their nominal state. The work permit process, a critical safety measure, requires decision-makers to assess the current state of safety barriers before authorizing work. This assessment is challenging due to the multitude of physical, technical, and human factors involved. In this paper, we propose an automated decision support system for the work permit process. Our approach uses state-based stochastic models to evaluate the risk associated with executing specific work activities. These models can be automatically composed based on the work permit under review.

## I. Introduction
Petroleum installations are complex socio-technical systems where accidents can have significant impacts on life, health, the environment, and the economy. Frequent work activities, such as maintenance and routine operations, are necessary to ensure the smooth operation of these installations. However, these activities can also pose safety threats, especially when handling hazardous materials.

To mitigate the risk of accidents, various safety barriers are implemented across the system. These barriers can include physical components, software, procedures, and trained personnel. The work permit process plays a central role in ensuring that work is only carried out if it is safe to do so. Decision-makers must consider the type of work, potential conflicts, and the current state of relevant safety barriers. Given the complexity and time constraints, there is a need for automated decision support tools to assist in this process.

In this paper, we propose a methodology to support the work permit decision process using quantitative measures derived from state-based stochastic models. This approach will provide decision-makers with objective and aggregated information, enabling them to make informed decisions and document their reasoning. The paper is organized as follows: Section II details the work permit system and its challenges, Section III discusses related work, Section IV introduces our model-based approach, Section V presents the model library, Section VI reports on a case study, Section VII discusses plans for automation and integration, and Section VIII provides conclusions.

## II. Safety Procedures in the Petroleum Domain

### A. The Work Permit System
The work permit system is a crucial mechanism for ensuring safety in petroleum installations. It coordinates work activities to avoid conflicts and ensures that potentially risky work is not initiated unless appropriate safety barriers are in place. For example, if gas detectors in a certain area are in a degraded state due to overdue maintenance, hot work such as welding should not be allowed unless compensating measures are in place.

Workers must apply for a work permit (WP) by filling out a standardized form. Decision-makers hold meetings every 12 hours to review incoming WP applications and decide which ones to release or reject. The number of applications can be high, limiting the time available for each decision. Making the right decision requires a thorough understanding of the current state of the safety barrier system, which can involve many different components and interactions.

Decision-makers must consider deviations of safety-related components from their nominal state, such as overdue maintenance and detected but unfixed errors. This information is typically collected during system operation and stored in a "deviations database." Decision-makers must identify, extract, and aggregate this information to assess the overall state of the barriers, a task complicated by subjectivity and potential human errors.

Automated decision support, integrated into a computer-based WP system, has been proposed to improve this process. The system checks the status of relevant safety barriers, aggregates the information, and provides quantitative metrics related to the risk of executing the work. If the state of barriers is unsatisfactory, the system issues a warning with an explanation. The decision-maker then makes the final decision, considering both the system's warning and additional knowledge, such as worker expertise.

### B. Challenges and Success Criteria
Implementing a complete decision support system involves several challenges:

1. **Run-time Monitoring:** Accurately monitoring all safety-relevant aspects of a complex system and maintaining an up-to-date and efficient database.
2. **Input Processing:** Handling free-text inputs in WP applications, which may require language processing techniques or structured formats.
3. **Information Aggregation:** Devising synthetic indicators to provide decision-makers with an immediate understanding of the system's state without requiring them to understand the complex computations behind the metrics.
4. **Scenario Variability:** Addressing the high variability of different scenarios, including the impact of faults, their propagation, and how they impair safety barriers.

Our approach addresses these challenges using quantitative safety metrics and state-based stochastic models, and by defining a set of template submodels that can be combined to evaluate different scenarios.

## III. Related Work
Several approaches for evaluating safety properties in the petroleum domain have been introduced, but none have been universally adopted. 

- **BORA-Release Method [4]:** Designed for barrier and operational risk analysis of hydrocarbon releases, it uses fault trees to model the performance of safety barriers. While fault trees are useful, state-based stochastic models allow for more detailed behavior modeling, including failure propagation and time-related aspects.
- **Røed et al. [5]:** Propose a hybrid approach using fault trees and Bayesian belief networks for risk assessment. Their method is resource-intensive and does not fully account for the temporal dimension.
- **Model-Driven Approaches [9, 10]:** These approaches use failure logic analysis techniques and are applied to case studies in the petroleum domain. Our approach complements these by providing a more detailed and flexible modeling framework.

## IV. Model-Based Approach
Our approach leverages state-based stochastic models to evaluate the risk associated with specific work activities. These models can be automatically composed based on the work permit under review, providing decision-makers with quantitative metrics to support their decisions.

## V. Model Library
We define a set of template submodels that can be combined to evaluate different scenarios. These submodels capture the behavior of various safety barriers and their interactions, allowing for a flexible and comprehensive risk assessment.

## VI. Case Study
We apply our approach to a simple case study to demonstrate its effectiveness. The case study involves a typical work permit scenario, and we show how the system evaluates the risk and provides decision support.

## VII. Automation and Integration
We discuss plans for automating and integrating the proposed steps into existing work permit systems. This includes the development of a user-friendly interface and the integration of real-time data from the deviations database.

## VIII. Conclusions
In conclusion, our model-based approach provides a robust and flexible solution for supporting safety-related decisions in the petroleum domain. By using state-based stochastic models, we can provide decision-makers with accurate and timely information, enabling them to make informed and documented decisions.
