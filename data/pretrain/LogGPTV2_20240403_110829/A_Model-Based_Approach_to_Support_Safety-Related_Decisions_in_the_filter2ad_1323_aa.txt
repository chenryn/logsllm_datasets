Abstract—Accidents on petroleum installations can have huge 
consequences;  to  mitigate  the  risk,  a  number  of  safety  barriers 
are devised. Faults and unexpected events may cause barriers to 
temporarily deviate from their nominal state. For safety reasons, 
a work permit process is in place: decision makers accept or re-
ject work permits based on the current state of barriers. Howev-
er,  this  is  difficult  to  estimate,  as  it  depends  on  a  multitude  of 
physical,  technical  and  human  factors.  Information  obtained 
from different sources needs to be aggregated by humans, typi-
cally within a limited amount of time. In this paper we propose 
an  approach  to  provide  an  automated  decision  support  to  the 
work permit system, which consists in the evaluation of quantita-
tive measures of the risk associated with the execution of work. 
The approach relies on state-based stochastic models, which can 
be automatically composed based on the work permit to be exam-
ined.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Petroleum  installations  are  complex  socio-technical  sys-
tems where accidents can have major impact on life, health and 
the environment; furthermore, they can lead to huge economic 
losses.  On  the  other  hand,  unnecessary  interruption  of  opera-
tions  would  have  a  strong  economic  impact  as  well.  For  this 
reason,  petroleum  installations  are  subject  to  frequent  work 
activities,  to  be  undertaken  during  normal  system  operation. 
Work activities include maintenance operations, periodic veri-
fication  of  equipment,  but  also  routine  work  operations.  Fre-
quently, the execution of an activity is subject to safety threats, 
for example when handling hazardous materials (e.g., flamma-
ble materials). 
To mitigate the risk of accidents, a number of countermeas-
ures,  called  safety  barriers,  are  devised  and  implemented 
across the entire system. Collectively, safety barriers constitute 
the “barrier system”, a complex (socio-technical) system whose 
behavior  depends  on  a  multitude  of  physical,  technical,  and 
human factors. In fact, barriers may consist of physical compo-
nents  (e.g.,  gas  detectors),  software,  procedures,  trained  hu-
mans, and basically everything that may contribute to risk re-
duction. 
Among these, a central role is played by the work permit 
process [3], which prescribes that work on installations can be 
carried out only if a specific written authorization (work per-
mit)  has  been  released.  Deciding  whether  to  release  or  not  a

certain work permit is a complex decision, which requires tak-
ing into account different aspects, including the kind of work, 
possible conflicting work in the same area, as well as the cur-
rent state of the safety barriers that are relevant for that work. 
Furthermore, barriers are subject to faults, and understanding to 
which  extents  they  are  able  to  perform  as  intended  is  funda-
mental. Such decisions are taken by humans, and often need to 
be taken within a limited amount of time. Supporting tools for 
this process are so far limited, which means that decision mak-
ers have to aggregate the information gathered from different 
sources and conclude, based on their expertise, whether author-
izing a certain work would be “sufficiently” safe or not. 
In  this  paper  we  propose  a  methodology  to  support  the 
work  permit  decisions  process  in  the  petroleum  domain.  The 
approach we propose is to compute quantitative measures ori-
ented to the evaluation of the risk associated with the execution 
of a certain work, using stochastic state-based models. Devel-
oping  a  decision  support  system  will  allow  operators  to have 
aggregate and objective information at their disposal, thus be-
ing able to take informed decisions, and document the motiva-
tions behind them. It should be noted that we are addressing a 
different  problem  with  respect  to  safety  cases,  which  serve  a 
different  purpose,  and  should  hold  for  very  long  time.  Con-
versely,  the  problem  we  address  is  evaluating  the  short-term 
risk associated with executing specific actions on installations. 
The paper is organized as follows. The problem we tackle 
is detailed in Section II, in which we introduce the work permit 
system  and  current  challenges.  Related  work  is  discussed  in 
Section III. Our  model-based  approach  and  the  information  it 
requires are illustrated in Section IV; the defined model library 
is presented in details in Section V. The application to a simple 
case study is then reported in Section VI, while in Section VII 
we discuss on the plans for automation and integration of the 
proposed steps. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VIII. 
II.  SAFETY PROCEDURES IN THE PETROLEUM DOMAIN 
A.  The Work Permit System 
A central task to ensure safety on petroleum installations is 
to coordinate work, in order to avoid conflicts and ensure that 
potentially risky work is not initiated unless appropriate coun-
termeasures, called safety barriers, are in place. For example, if 
in  a  certain  area  gas  detectors  are  in  a  degraded  state  due  to 
overdue  maintenance,  then  hot  work  such  as  welding  should 
not  be  allowed  in  that  area,  unless  appropriate  compensating 
measures are in place. This is enforced by the “work permit” 
system,  which  should  ensure  safe  execution  and  coordination 
of work on installations [3].   
Workers that need to perform non-routine work on an in-
stallation have to apply for a work permit (WP), by filling out a 
standardized form [3]. Every 12th hour, decision makers hold a 
meeting  to  go  through  all  incoming  WP  applications  for  the 
next 12 hours, and decide which ones to release (accept) and 
which ones to reject. The number of WP applications can be 
high, meaning that the time available for each decision is lim-
ited. Making the right decision requires a good understanding 
of the current state of safety barrier systems, which may consist 
of many different parts and components, possibly having com-
plex interactions.  
  Which system components are involved, and how they con-
tribute to the safety of work execution depends on a combina-
tion of: i) the cyber and physical architecture of the system, ii) 
the specifics of the work to be authorized, described in the WP, 
and iii) the current state of system components. Among all the 
aspects that decision makers have to take into account, infor-
mation  about  deviations  of  safety-related  components  from 
their  nominal  state  are  of  primary  importance.  This  includes, 
for example, components that are overdue for periodic mainte-
nance, errors detected but not yet fixed, and so on. This kind of 
information is typically collected during system operation, and 
stored in a “deviations database”. To take a properly informed 
decision, decision makers need to identify, extract and aggre-
gate all the relevant information in order to assess the overall 
state of the barriers.  
This is a very difficult task, which is made even more diffi-
cult  by  the  impact  of  subjectivity  and  possible  human  errors. 
For this reason, automated decision support, integrated into a 
computer-based WP system, has been theorized as a welcome 
improvement  to  the  WP  process,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  The 
process starts with the applicant submitting the WP application 
to the WP system; the application is then presented to the deci-
sion  maker  at  the  appropriate  time.  Based  on  the  specific  in-
formation provided in the application, the WP system checks 
the  status  of  relevant  safety  barriers,  aggregates  the  obtained 
information and provides, along with the WP, some quantita-
tive metrics related to the risk of executing that work. Optional-
ly, if the system estimates that the state of barriers is unsatis-
factory with respect to some predefined threshold, then it issues 
a warning accompanied by an explanation, which is notified to 
the decision maker.  
It is then up to the decision maker to finally decide whether 
to release or reject the WP. The decision is issued to the WP 
system and forwarded to the applicant, as illustrated by the two 
alternatives of the "alt" construct at the bottom of the diagram. 
We emphasize that the decision maker is ultimately responsible 
for the decision and will typically consider not only the warn-
ing (or absence of warning) from the WP system, but also addi-
tional  knowledge  that  may  not  be  available  to  the  automated 
decision support system, e.g., the expertise of workers. 
B.  Challenges and Success Criteria 
Realizing a complete decision support system as described 
above  requires  a  number  of  challenges  and  gaps  to  be  ad-

dressed.  In  the  following  we  summarize  the  main  challenges 
that we identified, and discuss the ones that we aim to address 
with our proposal. 
The first challenge consists in being able to accurately per-
form run-time monitoring on all the safety-relevant aspects of a 
complex  system  like  a  petroleum  installation.  This  includes 
keeping all the data in a well-organized and efficient database, 
and ensuring that stored information does not become outdated. 
Deciding which variables to monitor, and the acquisition inter-
val is also an important challenge. We do not address this as-
pect, and assume (as it is the case) that monitoring facilities are 
put in place by the owner of the infrastructure. 
The kind of input that should be processed by the WP sys-
tem introduces additional complexity. Although standard forms 
have  been  established  [3],  a  work  permit  application  is  to  a 
large degree constituted by free text, which should somehow be 
interpreted by the WP system. This aspect is also not addressed 
here: we assume that the information we need is available in a 
structured way in the WP application. Such information can be 
extracted  via  language  processing  techniques,  or  simply  by 
using a structured format for WP applications. We believe that 
this will happen as operators switch from paper-based to com-
puter-based work permit systems. The work in this paper was 
inspired by cooperation with software providers currently pio-
neering this development. 
The  aggregation  of  the  information  contained  in  the  data-
base, and in the WP application, is also a great challenge. Syn-
thetic indicators need to be devised, so that the decision maker 
has an immediate understanding of the current state of the sys-
tem. The decision maker should be able to understand the se-
mantic  behind  the  aggregated  metrics,  but  he/she  should  be 
alleviated from understanding how they have been computed, 
which may involve the application of complex techniques. The 
approach  we  introduce  in  this  paper  addresses  this  challenge 
using  quantitative  safety  metrics  and  state-based  stochastic 
models. 
A final aspect to be considered is the high variability of dif-
ferent scenarios that the WP system should be able to address. 
The impact of faults, their propagation, and the way in which 
they  impair  the  safety  barriers  is  very  variable,  based  on  the 
kind of WP which is being requested. Different WPs may ap-
276
ply to different areas of the system and different kind of works; 
different conditions of the system may further introduce varia-
bility. The approach proposed in this paper addresses this prob-
lem by defining a set of template SAN [11] submodels that can 
be combined in different ways to automatically evaluate differ-
ent scenarios. 
III.  RELATED WORK 
Approaches  for  the  evaluation  of  safety  properties  in  the 
petroleum domain have been introduced in the literature. How-
ever, none of them have been universally adopted by the indus-
try. 
The BORA-Release method [4] is designed specifically for 
barrier and operational risk analysis of hydrocarbon releases. It 
addresses  a  full  risk  analysis  process  and  therefore  it  has  a 
broader scope than our approach. One of the steps of the pro-
cess  consists  of  modeling  the  performance  of  safety  barriers, 
which  is  performed  using  fault  trees.  With  respect  to  fault-
trees, state-based stochastic models like those used in this pa-
per allow more detailed behaviors to be modeled (e.g., failure 
propagation,  time-related  aspects).  At  the  same  time,  we  be-
lieve  that  our  approach  provides  an  alternate  solution  for  the 
modeling  of  safety  barriers  that  could  be  plugged  into  the 
BORA-Release method. 
Røed et al. [5] propose an interesting approach for the anal-
ysis of risk on petroleum installations. Their approach allows 
some parts of the risk assessment to be addressed using fault 
trees,  while  other  parts  are  addressed  using  Bayesian  belief 
networks.  Hybrid  casual  logic  is  then  applied  to  analyze  the 
barriers  in  terms  of  probability  of  barrier  failure.  However, 
there are fundamental differences in the way barriers are mod-
eled; for example, our approach is able to take into account the 
temporal  dimension.  Furthermore  the  authors  state  that  their 
technique is resource intensive.  
Other  approaches,  like  ours,  are  geared  towards  a  model-
driven  approach.  The  work  in  [9]  introduces  an  approach  for 
the safety analysis of socio-technical systems, based on failure 
logic  analysis  techniques.  The  approach  is  applied  to  a  case 
study in the petroleum domain. The authors of [10] introduce
