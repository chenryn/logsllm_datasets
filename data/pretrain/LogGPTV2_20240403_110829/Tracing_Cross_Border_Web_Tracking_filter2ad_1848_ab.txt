over more than 19K third-party domains. For a detailed summary,
see Table 1. The collected dataset includes the user’s country, the
first-party visited domain, the third-party contacted URL and the
associated IP.
Ethical considerations: As we have previously stated, all the
users in this study were recruited from the CrowdFlower plat-
form [4]. All the users were informed in detail about what data we
collect and gave their explicit consent before installing the extension.
Users could choose at any point to opt-out of the experiment by sim-
ply uninstalling the browser extension. This would stop any data
transfer to our servers. Regarding already collected data, although
we can delete any part of it, it’s impossible to identify specific users
since we do not store any unique identifier on users. For example,
we did not keep logs of actual IPs, but only the geolocated regions.
We also took additional measures to protect the identity of the user,
namely, we only collected domain names instead of full URLs. Thus,
we avoided inadvertently collecting the full browsing history of
a user, or storing identity information that may appear on URLs.
Obviously we refrained from asking or collecting any personally
identifiable information such as the real name of the users, emails,
addresses, etc. All users were compensated through the platform
for keeping the browser extension running for an amount of time.
3.2 Identifying trackers
In this section we explain our methodology for identifying whether
a third-party request is actually a tracking flow or just some other
type of service (i.e., voice chat, commenting services, etc.). Cur-
rently, the most common solution is to use a block-list. The most
popular lists for detecting ad- and tracking-related requests are
the “easylist” and the “easyprivacy” [7] list, respectively. The issue
with the above two lists is that they are constructed and used for
blocking third-party requests from web browser extensions, such as,
the AdBlockPlus [1] and Ghostery [9]. By blocking a tracking flow
early, they do not allow any additional tracking code to be executed,
which in turn may open additional connections and thereby reveal
additional tracking requests that do not match any rules or domains
in the above two lists.
To overcome the above limitation, we first use the above two
lists (easylist and easyprivacy) to classify all the third-party flows
that we collect either as tracking or not. This produces a list of
tracking flows (LTF) that includes all third-party requests that the
two filtering lists identify as ad or tracking related requests and a
list of non-tracking flows (NTF). As a second step, we use the list of
LTF to classify additional third-party requests. We examine if the
referrer field of the remaining non-tracking flows in the NTF list
includes any URL already detected in the LTF list and also if the URL
string includes any arguments. Note that argument parsing using
the URL is a widely used technique for passing information between
tracking domains. If a non-tracking flow satisfies both requirements
we then classify it also as a tracking flow. Note that the execution of
additional requests using third-party code (JavaScript) embedded
directly into the first-party context populates the referrer field of
the request with the first-party URL. Nevertheless, most of this
cases are requests towards well known ad networks to initialize
the rendering process of the available ad slots within the first-party
webpage, such as, googlesyndication.com.
Finally, for the remaining non-tracking flows, we also classify
third-party requests as tracking flows when the request URL include
arguments and also the URL string include some widely used key-
words related to web tracking and advertising, such as, “usermatch”,
“rtb”, “cookiesync”, etc. Note that we build the list of keywords em-
pirically.
Table 2 presents the third-party requests classification results.
Using the two AdBlockPlus lists (easylist, easyprivacy), we manage
to classify a total of 2.4M third-party requests as tracking flows
(Table 2 - Row 1). In total, we have more than 500K unique URLs
towards 1.8K top level domains (TLD). Using our semi-automatic
classification (Table 2 - Row 2), we manage to classify an additional
1.9M third-party requests as tracking flows from more than 400K
unique URLs and a total of 879 top-level domains.
In Fig. 2 we plot the CDF of the tracking and non-tracking flows
that we detect in each website in our dataset. The top (dashed)
line depicts the CDF of the non-tracking flows and the middle
(dot-dashed) line the tracking flows. Finally, the bottom (solid) line
depicts the total of all requests that we observe including both
tracking and non-tracking flows from within each website. The
main takeaway from Fig. 2 is that on average, most of the third-party
requests are ad and tracking related flows.

Finally, Fig. 3 lists the top 20 TLDs of the tracking flows that
we detect in our dataset. “ABP” denotes the number of tracking
flows detected using the AdBlockPlus lists and “SEMI” denotes the
ones detected using the semi-automatic classification. We observe
that most of the additional tracking flows detected by the semi-
automatic methodology involves domains belonging to ad networks,
mostly triggered by the (potentially blocked) ad related initial third-
party request and constituently not detectable by ABP.
3.3 Collecting tracker IPs
For each third-party domain, we collect all the associated IPs that
were returned to users who successfully established a connection.
Real users from all over the world participated in our four-month
experiment. In total, we collected 28,939 tracking IPs. More than
97% of them were IPv4.
Furthermore, to address Challenge 2, i.e., to improve complete-
ness of our measurement, we took some additional steps. First, we
utilized passive DNS replication (pDNS) [63], a method that collects
DNS data from production networks and stores it in a database
for later reference. In this work we rely on Robtex implementation
of pDNS [22]. These databases provide info on (i) forward DNS
records, i.e., the IPs associated with a given domain as well as the
starting and the end of the time period of this association, and, (ii)
reverse DNS records, that map an IP for a given time period to
the domains that were served by this IP. For the duration of the
experiment, we identified only 806 additional IPs (i.e., small 2.78%
increase on the number of IPs, mainly IPv4 (60%) that served the
tracking domains but could not identify from the logs of the real
users. We also annotated the active periods for the pair domain-IP
based on the starting and end active time in the database.
Next, we investigate if other services/domains share the same
IP. In Fig. 4, we plot the histogram and the CDF for the number of
TLDs served by an identified tracking IP weighted by the number
of requests. Around 85% of the requests served by IPs serve only
Figure 4: The CDF of number of domains detected behind
each IP (right y-axis) and the total number of request (left
y-axis) observed in the real users dataset.
one TLD. This is to be expected as tracking services would like
to sustain a good performance and thus, dedicate the IP for this
service. Delays may reduce revenue, and if the tracker is involved
in RTB, it is important to guarantee a short round trip time with the
user, as the bidding time is typically in the order of 100 msec [13].
In the same figure also shows that the fraction of IPs that serve
more than one domain is less than 2%. A closer investigation shows
that the other TLDs usually belong to the same organization, and
they are tracking related domains as well (e.g., in the case of Google,
doubleclick.net and googlesyndication.com). Thus, measuring the
flows that involve the identified tracking IPs, for the time period
that the pair tracking domain and tracking IP is valid, will give us
a good estimation of the tracking flows.
Nevertheless, there are a few IPs (114 in total) – about half of
them in the USA and in EU28 (see Fig. 5) – that serve a large number
of domains – 10 or more. A closer investigation showed that these
IPs are used for ad related activities, such as, ad exchange points,
RTB auctions or cookie-syncing as they serve a large number of
domains related to the advertisement and tracking industry.
3.4 Geolocating web tracker IPs
To address Challenge 3, we geolocate the ad and tracking related
IPs as accurately as possible in order to minimize artifacts that can
bias our analysis. It is well reported that commercial geolocation
databases are unreliable when it comes to geolocating network
infrastructure [31, 34, 37, 39, 50, 56]. This is expected as the com-
mercial interest of these databases is to geolocate the end user
accurately – the customers of such databases are enterprises that
want to geolocate their visitors/clients. Several existing studies
have shown that commercial databases, such as MaxMind [16], are
particularly bad for geolocating web servers [31, 56]. For example,
in the case of Google, MaxMind typically geolocates a Google IP
to Mountain View, the headquarters of Google and not to the real
physical location of the server, which can be at any Google data-
center, at a peering facility (edge point of presence), or even inside
an ISP (edge cache) [12, 31, 59].

In Table 3 we compare the pair-wise agreement on the country
and continent, across geolocation tools, namely, (i) IP-API free ge-
olocation tool [15], (ii) MaxMind [16], and (iii) RIPE IPmap [21], for
the tracking IPs we inferred with the browser extension (includ-
ing the additional IPs we found with forward DNS). The overlap
between IP-API and MaxMind is very high, more than 96% on the
country level and 99% on the continent level. However, both dis-
agree when compared with the IPmap. About half of the IPs are
mapped to a different country and approximately a third of the
IPs are mapped to a different continent. This is an indication that
using MaxMind or IP-API would yield incorrect geolocation in our
analysis, since one of the end points of all our flows is always a
backend infrastructure server.
To further investigate the impact of the MaxMind database as
opposed to RIPE IPmap, we concentrate on three large ad + tracking
provider, namely, Google Ads+Tracking IPs, Amazon Ads+Tracking
IPs3 and Facebook Ads+Tracking IPs. In Table 4 it is clear that about
half of the IPs of these major providers are mis-geolocated to the
wrong country, and anywhere between 30%-60% are mis-geolocated
to the wrong continent.
4 QUANTIFYING BORDER CROSSING
In this section, we present our measurement results on the amount
of tracking flows crossing different national and international bor-
ders. All the results of this section are based on measurements
obtained with our browser extension and recruited users. Later in
Sect. 7, we present corresponding results from four large ISPs with
more than 60 million users.
Figure 6 shows the percentages of tracking flows exchanged be-
tween continents (or geographic regions like EU28). The thickness
of the Sankey diagram is proportional to the amount of measure-
ments that we have from each region. We see that most tracking
originating at users within EU28 terminates at tracking servers within
EU28. The actual percentage is 84.9% as shown in the more de-
tailed Fig. 7(b). This result contrasts popular belief, as well as recent
reports [52] claiming that most tracking of European citizens is
conducted by trackers physically located outside Europe. The dis-
crepancy is explained by the different IP geolocation methods used
(see Sect. 3.4 for details) but also owes to other reasons. For example,
in the case of [52] the variations are also due to difference in the
platforms in use (Mobile vs. Desktop in our case) and the variation
between the two platforms (mobile apps vs. web browsing), see
Sect. 8 for more details.

A number of active techniques have been developed for improv-
ing the IP geolocation accuracy for the server infrastructures [31].
RIPE has incorporated these techniques in a single publicly available
tool called RIPE IPmap [21]. IPmap uses a large global installation of
more than 11K active measurement probes, namely RIPE Atlas [20],
to perform active measurements in order to geolocate an IP. The
footprint of the RIPE Atlas probes is particularly dense in Europe
(more than 5K probes) thus, in Europe the accuracy is expected to
be high, especially at country level, which suffices for our study.
RIPE Atlas has also a large footprint in the US, with more than 1K
probes thus, using IPmap we can accurately distinguish if a server is
in Europe or in the US. For every IP geolocation request, more than
100 RIPE Atlas probes are assigned to perform active measurements.
After the geolocation process is finished, each probe replies with an
estimation of the physical location of the target (server in our study)
at the city, country, and continent level. We noticed that, across all
our measurements, the replies from the involved probes agree on
the continent, and also with a majority of above 90% on the country.
We also noticed that the disagreement on the country level (less
than 10%) occurs around the borders of neighboring countries. For
our analysis, we do a majority voting and we keep the most popular
estimation. To further evaluate the accuracy of RIPE IPmap, we
geolocated the IP ranges of two large content providers, Amazon
AWS [2] and Microsoft Azure [17], that made the location of the
servers in these ranges publicly available. Our analysis about the
active IPs that replied to our requests showed that RIPE IPmap
accurately geolocate the server IPs at both country (99.58%) and
continent level (100%) for the above two cloud services.

Unlike EU28 that exhibits high confinement of tracking flows
within the continent, our second larger user base in South America
sees most of its tracking flows (95%) leaking out of the continent and
into North America (90%). Since we mainly focused on recruiting
European users for our study, the other continents shown in the
diagram have small user bases and therefore the confinements
ratios are not easy to read from the diagram. The actual numbers
are Africa 2.11% (22), Asia 16.39% (20), Rest of Europe 12.94% (23),
South America 4.42% (86), North America 86.83% (16), confinement
percentage (number of users), respectively.
Overall, we see that EU28 and North America host most of the
tracking backends, 51% and 40% of all traffic flow terminations,
respectively. Other countries, with large IT infrastructure/server
hosting receive a disproportionally high number of flows compared
with the users in our dataset, e.g., Ireland (3.4%), Switzerland (2%),
France (6%), Russia (1.5%).4
4.1 EU28 GDPR jurisdiction
In the remainder of the paper, we focus on tracking of users in
EU28, where we have our largest user base (183 users). Figure 7(a)
shows the percentage of tracking flows that terminate in different
continents for users within EU28 under MaxMind geolocation. Fig-
ure 7(b) shows the same percentages under RIPE IPmap geolocation,
and the difference in numbers is astonishing. In fact, this single
property of the methodology - the method used for IP geolocation
can flip the qualitative takeaway of the result. Under MaxMind one
concludes that most European tracking flows leak towards North
America, whereas under RIPE IPmap, they remain confined within
