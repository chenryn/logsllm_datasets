User: We have an in-house developed network-based application that is based on python, it provides a command-line environment in the same way like python does. I also have a local python installation on my machine. Sometimes for simple python tasks, i prefer using my local python install... Is possible to to have a different PYSTARTUP env variable for each of installation?
Assistant: You can always export PYSTARTUP="whatever" on the shell before starting your script.
You can also put PYSTARTUP="whatever" in front of the command you want to run, e.g. PYSTARTUP="whatever" python something.py
