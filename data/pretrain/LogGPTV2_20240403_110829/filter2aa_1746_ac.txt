### Interesting Relationships

#### Slide 72: Extraversion
Extraversion was the most significant personality trait in our study, although its impact was minimal. This could be due to the limited scope of the personality test we used or because certain aspects of extraversion, not shared by all extraverts, play a more critical role.

#### Slide 73: Not So Surprising…
"Introverted students tend to hesitate before taking action, while extroverts act without hesitation."

#### Slide 76: So What?
While Twitter attributes are good candidates for machine learning (which we will discuss shortly), personality traits also have significant implications.

#### Slide 77: eLearning
eLearning is widespread in corporate environments. Research suggests that learners with higher levels of extraversion perform better when they have greater control over their learning experience. If social media security awareness is proven effective, tailoring the learning experience based on the learner's personality could further enhance its effectiveness.

#### Slide 78: Machine Learning
**Note:** This section will be updated prior to the presentation date.
This deck includes results based on the Nearest Neighbor (Weka’s NNge algorithm). The final version will incorporate additional data and alternative models.
For the second part of the question, "Is it possible to increase the odds of getting a response from a Twitter user?"—since there are relationships, this is a good candidate for machine learning.

#### Slide 79: Baseline - Spray & Pray
| TP | FP | TN | FN |
|----|----|----|----|
| 123 | 487 | - | - |

Our baseline performance is roughly 80% misses and 20% hits, with 123 successful interactions and 487 misses. This is consistent with other studies and observations.

#### Slide 80: Baseline - Spray & Pray
| TP | FP | TN | FN |
|----|----|----|----|
| 123 | 487 | - | - |

It is reasonable to suggest that non-responders may become frustrated by unsolicited requests...

#### Slide 81: ...ultimately resulting in account suspension.
Twitter jail. From a machine learning perspective, we aim to avoid frustrating the 80% of non-responders. While bots will eventually improve at engaging these users, our current focus is on low-hanging fruit.

#### Slide 82: Perfection
| TP | FP | TN | FN |
|----|----|----|----|
| - | - | - | - |

The ideal scenario would classify all Twitter users accurately. Our goal is to minimize false positives (FPs) and maximize true positives (TPs).

#### Slide 83: Addressing Class Imbalance
The first challenge is to address the class imbalance, where more people are likely to ignore our bot than to interact with it. We used the Weka tool and the SMOTE preprocessing filter to oversample the minority class (users who do interact with our bot).

#### Slide 84: Result of Using SMOTE
[Content for this slide is missing. Please provide additional details.]

#### Slide 85: Performance with SMOTE
We found that Weka’s NNge (a nearest neighbor-like algorithm) provided the best performance for our needs. We set it up with G = 25.

#### Slide 86: Model Creation
To create the model, we used 10-fold cross-validation, achieving a precision of 71% on the "interacted" class.

#### Slide 87: Test/PoC Set
- 48 people

#### Slide 88: Estimated Performance
| TP | FP | FN | TN |
|----|----|----|----|
| 4 | 9 | 10 | 35 |

Precision: 71%
N = 58 (After SMOTE)
The predicted performance in Weka looks like this, but the minority class (TP and FN) is doubled due to the SMOTE preprocessing.

#### Slide 89: Adjusted Estimated Performance
| TP | FP | FN | TN |
|----|----|----|----|
| 4 | 4 | 5 | 35 |

Precision: 54.8%
N = 48 (Estimate)
By halving the minority class, the precision drops. Note that simply halving the minority class is not ideal, but it provides a general perspective on anticipated performance.

#### Slide 90: Actual Performance in PoC
| TP | FP | FN | TN |
|----|----|----|----|
| 5 | 4 | 7 | 32 |

Precision: 44.4%
N = 48
The large number of TNs reduces the chance of being ignored or suspended. This performance is close to our test sets.

#### Slide 91: Performance Comparison
| Targeted | Spray & Pray |
|----------|--------------|
| 5        | 4            |
| 11       | 37           |

#### Slide 92: Future Work: Ranking Targets
We envisage that bot owners will prioritize targets based on various attributes and cues to increase the probability of a response.

#### Slide 93: Conclusions
[Content for this slide is missing. Please provide additional details.]

#### Slide 94: So What?
Firstly, this work is based on the premise that the 'spray and pray' approach to engaging users with a social bot (or human) is becoming less effective. Social bot creators need to be less noisy to avoid account suspension. We considered several use cases, and I will highlight five briefly.

#### Slide 95: #1 AstroTurfers and Their Ilk
Finding users who are most likely to help propagate your message or at least give credence to the bot account.

#### Slide 96: #2 Marketeers/Salespeople
Marketeers looking to increase their Klout (Kred, etc.) score can focus on users more likely to interact with them. This strategy can be useful for building a brand, but it may also lead to some users receiving more spam.

#### Slide 97: #3 Social Engineers
Since the most predictive features (Klout score, number of friends/followers) are easily obtained through API calls, it is straightforward to build models in Maltego. For example, @Alice's imaginary Twitter friends can be flagged using a simple local-transform to identify users more likely to engage in conversation, which can be useful for social engineers.

#### Slide 98: #3 Social Engineers (Continued)
Building trust relationships with these users before convincing the target to accept an email with malicious content makes sense. Focusing on users with a higher likelihood of responding reduces noise.

#### Slide 99: Privacy Implications
All of these scenarios have privacy implications, so how might social network providers and their users respond?

#### Slide 100: #4 Usable Security
Social network providers can use this knowledge to design usable security controls, warning users when they might be getting "gamed." The Truthy project at Indiana University is already providing important insights in this context.

#### Slide 101: #5 Training
This work suggests that different human behaviors and personality traits should be considered in creating and executing training material. Tailoring corporate training to individuals with higher extraversion may improve its effectiveness.

#### Slide 102: Limitations
- Basic study: No attempt to get users to click on links.
- Each user received a different question.
- Bots had varying followers and interactions, affecting credibility.
- Basic measures of personality (TIPI).

#### Slide 103: Future Research Opportunities
- Focus on more detailed Big Five factors.
- Cognitive Reflective Test or other measures of impulsivity.
- Target-centric approach: Bots need to engage the target on topics of interest and fit into the group.

#### Slide 104: Positive Applications
Intelligent agents can be used for positive actions. For example, a popular dating site deployed bots to flirt with other bots, reducing spam.

#### Slide 105: Turing Test and Blade Runner
"For the foreseeable future, individual Web users must improve their ability to evaluate threats emanating from cyberspace. Illustrations from the Turing Test and Blade Runner suggest that sufficient interactivity with a computer should reveal that it is not human."

#### Slide 107: Network Features
- 3 directed networks: Follow, retweet, and interaction (retweet, reply, mention, and follow) networks.

  - High authority score nodes have many incoming edges from high hub score nodes.
  - High hub score nodes have many outgoing edges to high authority score nodes.
