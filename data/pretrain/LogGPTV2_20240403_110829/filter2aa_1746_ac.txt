Interesting Relationships
Slide 72 
Extraversion
Out of all the personality traits, extraversion 
played the most important part, although the 
significance was very small.  This could be due 
to the small personality test we used or that 
certain aspects of extraversion play a part, 
aspects which not all extraverts share. 
Slide 73 
Not so surprising…
“introverted students tend to hesitate before 
they take action, extroverts act without any 
hesitations at all” 1

So what?
So what?, While twitter attributes look like 
good candidates for Machine Learning (we’ll 
get to that in a moment), personality also has 
implications.  
Slide 77 
eLearning
eLearning is ubiquitous in the corporate 
environment, but research suggests that 
learners with higher levels of extraversion 
perform better when they have greater levels 
of control over the learning experience. i.e. it’s 
not a click through exercise.  If social media 
security awareness is proven the be effective, 
then it’s likely that the effectiveness can be 
further improved by tailoring learning based on 
the personality of the learner. 
Slide 78 
Machine Learning
NOTE:
Please note that this section will change prior to 
the presentation date.
This deck includes results based on Nearest 
Neighbour (Weka’s NNge algorithm). The final 
deck will change to take into account additional 
data and alternative models.
…On the second part of the question... “Is it 
possible to increase the odds of getting a 
response from a twitter user?”… since there 
are relationships, this is a good candidate for 
machine learning.

Our baseline performance is roughly 80/20, 
with a 123 hits and 487 misses.  This is pretty 
consistent with other studies and observations.

It might be reasonable to suggest that non-

….ultimately resulting in account suspension. 
Twitter jail.  From a machine learning 
perspective, we want our bots to avoid 
frustrating the 80% of non-responders (sure, in 
time bots will do better at engaging them, but 
for now we focus on low-hanging fruit).

Perfect would look like this. With all twitter 
users in our sample accurately classified. 
Our goal is really to minimize the FP’s and 
maximize the TP’s. 
Slide 83 
Slide 84 
The first challenge is the address the class 
imbalance (see the red bar on this screenshot).  
That is, more people are likely to ignore our bot 
than to interact with it.  We used the Weka tool 
and employed the preprocessing filter, SMOTE 
to oversample the minority class (users who DO 
interact with our bot).  
Slide 85 
…here’s the result of using SMOTE (see the 
minority class increase). 
Slide 86 
We then found that Weka’s NNge (a nearest 
neighbor like algorithm) provided the most 
attractive performance for our needs.  We set 
it up with G at 25. 
Slide 87 
To create a model, we used 10 fold cross-
validation, which gave of a precision of .71 on 
the “interacted” class.

The predicted performance (in Weka) looks like 
this, but we have to acknowledge that the 
minority class (represented by TP and FN) is 
double the size that it otherwise would be due 
to the SMOTE we applied in pre-processing.

By halving the minority class we see that the 
precision would suffer. NOTE. Simply halving 
the minority class really isn’t a good idea, but 
in this case is used to provide some general 
perspective/a crude estimate of anticipated 
performance. 
Slide 91 
We took this a step further with a 3rd group of 
participants and conducted a Proof of Concept.  
We picked 49 further volunteers (It was 50, but 
they subsequently left twitter). Here’s the 
actual performance. The precession takes a hit 
as we’d predicted.

The size of TNs is large, but since we’re not 
trying to interact with them, we reduce the 
chance of getting ignored, or suspended by a 
sizeable chunk. 
This is pretty close to the performance in our 
test sets.

In terms of use by social bots, we envisage that

cues. 
Slide 95 
Conclusions
Slide 96 
So what?
So what?   
Firstly, this work is really based on the premise 
that the days are numbers for the ‘spray & 
pray’ approach to getting users to 
engage/interact with a social bot (or indeed a 
human). i.e. Social Bot creators will need to be 
less noisy to avoid account suspension. 
Assuming this, we considered a number of use 
cases. I’ll highlight (briefly) five of them. 
Slide 97 
#1 AstroTurfers and their ilk
#1. AstroTurfers and their ilk: Finding users 
who are most likely to help propagate your 
message or at the very least, give credence to 
the bot account. 
Slide 98 
#2 Marketeers/Salespeople
#2. Marketeers: Marketeers who are looking to 
get a higher klout (kred etc) score for their 
brand might be able to focus on users who are 
more likely to interact (or engage) with them. 
This might be a useful strategy for the early 
stages of building a brand (fake or otherwise), 
but it could also mean that some users are 
deluged with far more spam than others.  
Slide 99 
#3 Social Engineers
#3. Social Engineering Assignments: Since the 
most predictive features (klout score, number 
of friends/follows) are easily obtained through 
API calls, this makes it very easy to build/model 
in Maltego.  Here we can see @Alice’s 
imaginary Twitter friends. A simple Maltego 
local-transform could be used to flag users who 
are more likely to engage in conversation, 
which might prove use for Social Engineers 
looking for weaker points in a social graph. E.g. 
You know the Twitter accounts of users in 
AcmeCorp and want to highlight the one’s who 
maybe most likely to talk to you. The red icons 
are the users to focus on.   
One approach here would be to build one or 
more trust relationships with the “red” users 
before…. 
Slide 100 
#3 Social Engineers
…convincing the target to accept an email from 
you with malicious content.   In this scenario, it 
seems that it would make sense to generate 
less noise and focus on the users where the 
odds of a reply are better.   
Slide 101 
All of these have privacy 
implications, so how might social 
network providers and their 
users respond?
All of these have privacy implications, so how 
might social network providers and their users

Slide 102 
#4 Useable Security
#4 Social Network Providers:  Knowing more 
about how different users behave *may* help 
in the design of usable security controls on 
Social Network platforms, warning users when 
they might be getting “gamed”.  The Truthy 
project at Indiana University is already like to 
provide so important thinking in this context. 
Slide 103 
#5 Training
#5 Training : (as previously mentioned) this 
work suggests that differing human 
behaviour/personality traits need to be 
considered in the creation/execution of 
training material.  This isn’t to say training is 
ineffective, but it does say that it’s reasonable 
to hypothesize that current corporate training 
isn’t tailored to the people who need it the 
most (those higher in extraversion). 
It may also be possible for users to become 
more self-aware.  E.g. Am I extroverted? If I am, 
then maybe I need to check who I’m interacting 
with, with a little more rigour. 
Slide 104 
Limitations
• Basic study in that we didn’t attempt to get 
users to click on links (as a real scammer 
would)
• Each user got a different question
• As the experiment progressed, each bot had 
more followers and interactions and 
therefore maybe more/less credibility
• Basic measures of personality TIPI
Now there were a number of limitations… 
Slide 105 
Future Research Opportunities
• Likely focus on more detailed Big 5 factors
• Cognitive Reflective Test (or other measures 
of impulsivity)
• Focus on target-centric approach. i.e. bots 
need to engage the target on a topic the 
target is interested in. Bot needs to “fit in” to 
the group.
Slide 106 
It’s not all negative
• Intelligent Agents can be used for positive 
actions two.  For example, a popular dating 
site, besieged with dating bots, deployed it’s 
own bots and now has a subsection of it’s 
site where bots flirt with other bots.
Slide 107 
“Illustrations from the Turing Test and Blade 
Runner suggest that sufficient interactivity 
with a computer should reveal that it is not 
human.”
Temmingh & Geer’s 2009 
It’s fitting that we end with Temmingh & Geer’s 
2009 paper for the current best defenses for 
users… 
“For the foreseeable future, individual Web 
users must improve their own ability to 
evaluate threats emanating from cyberspace 
[9]. In most cases, the key is credibility. 
Illustrations from the Turing Test and Blade 
Runner suggest that sufficient interactivity with 
a computer should reveal that it is not human.”

Network Features
• 3 directed networks: Follow, retweet and interaction 
(retweet, reply, mention and follow) network
• Hub and Authority Score (HITS)
– High authority score node has many incoming edges from 
nodes with a high hub score
– High hub score node has many outgoing edges to nodes 
with a high authority score
• In-degree and Out-degree
• Clustering Coefficient
– number of actual links between the neighbors of a node 
divided by the number of possible links between them
