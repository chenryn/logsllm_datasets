I understand that you are encountering a "Permission denied" error while trying to install the 3DR Solo command line on Windows 10. The specific error occurs when the `shutil.copyfile(srcfile, destfile)` function is executed, and it seems to be related to file permissions.

### Error Details
The traceback indicates that the error is occurring during the installation process, specifically when `pip` attempts to copy the `_cffi_backend.cp35-win32.pyd` file to the destination directory.

### Suggested Solution
If you are upgrading the `cffi` package (i.e., you already have an older version installed and are trying to upgrade it), you can resolve this issue by following these steps:

1. **Delete the Existing File:**
   - Locate and delete the existing `_cffi_backend.cp35-win32.pyd` file in the `c:\python35\Lib\site-packages\` directory.
   - You can do this manually or by using a command like:
     ```sh
     del c:\python35\Lib\site-packages\_cffi_backend.cp35-win32.pyd
     ```

2. **Retry the Installation:**
   - After deleting the file, try running the installation command again. For example:
     ```sh
     pip install 3DR-solo-command-line
     ```

### Additional Tips
- **Run as Administrator:**
  - If you continue to experience permission issues, try running your command prompt or terminal as an administrator. This can often resolve permission-related problems.

- **Check for Running Processes:**
  - Ensure that no other processes are using the file. You can use tools like `Process Explorer` from Sysinternals to check if any processes have a lock on the file.

- **Update Python and Pip:**
  - Make sure you are using the latest versions of Python and `pip`. Sometimes, updating these tools can resolve compatibility and permission issues.

- **Virtual Environment:**
  - Consider using a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. This can help avoid conflicts with system-wide packages and simplify permission management.
  - You can create a virtual environment using:
    ```sh
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
  - Activate the virtual environment and then run the installation:
    ```sh
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    pip install 3DR-solo-command-line
    ```

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your setup and any additional error messages, so I can assist you further.
