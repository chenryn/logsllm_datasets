User: I am trying to install 3DR solo command line on Windows 10.  Below is the exception that i get.  i have been doing a lot of reading and googling.  I couldnt figure out the permission denied problem.  I have this part  shutil.copyfile(srcfile, destfile), but i still get denied.  
Exception:

Assistant: If you are upgrading the cffi package i.e. you had it already installed and doing pip install xyz package that is trying to upgrade cffi to its last version, all you have to do is simply
delete: c:\python35\Lib\site-packages\_cffi_backend.cp35-win32.pyd then try again.
