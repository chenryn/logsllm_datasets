User: I'd like to search for a given MAC address on my network, all from within a Python script.  I already have a map of all the active IP addresses in the network but I cannot figure out how to glean the MAC address.  Any ideas?
Assistant: It seems that there is not a native way of doing this with Python.  Your best bet would be to parse the output of "ipconfig /all" on Windows, or "ifconfig" on Linux.  Consider using os.popen() with some regexps.
