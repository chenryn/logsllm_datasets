### Ethical Considerations in the Security Community

Much like medical doctors who adhere to a professional code of conduct to "do no harm," should computer security experts also follow a corresponding professional ethos, using their expertise only for good? How should judgments be made between justifiable and unjustifiable surveillance, and who should make these decisions? Additionally, how can computer security experts balance the need to publicize attacks to support anti-IPS (Intimate Partner Surveillance) efforts with the risk that such information might inadvertently aid more attackers?

### Conclusion

In this study, we have provided the first comprehensive measurement of online communities where individuals engaging in IPS discuss their tactics. Through a mixed-methods analysis of five public forums, including a Reddit subforum dedicated to infidelity, we developed a taxonomy of the IPS strategies discussed online. Our findings show that these forums serve as platforms for both spam advertising specific spyware products and organic discussions of surveillance tools among users. We highlighted threads where (ab)users learn new IPS tactics from more tech-savvy forum-goers, as well as instances where forums discourage them from conducting IPS. Our work is already informing anti-IPS interventions by supporting programs that directly assist victims.
