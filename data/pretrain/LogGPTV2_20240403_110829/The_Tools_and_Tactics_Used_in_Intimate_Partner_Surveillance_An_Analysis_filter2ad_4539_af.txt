ethos to wield their expertise only for good? How should judg-
ment calls between justiﬁable and unjustiﬁable surveillance
be made, and who should make them? And how can computer
security experts balance publicizing attacks to support anti-
IPS efforts (for example, in this work) against the possibility
that doing so might inadvertently help more attackers?
9 Conclusion
We have provided the ﬁrst measurement study of the online
communities in which people enacting IPS discuss their tac-
tics. Through a mixed-methods study of ﬁve public forums,
including a Reddit subforum dedicated to inﬁdelity, we de-
veloped a taxonomy of the IPS strategies attackers discuss
online. We showed that these forums are sites for both spam
advertising speciﬁc spyware products and organic discussion
of surveillance tools between users. We highlighted threads in
which (ab)users learn new IPS tactics from more tech-savvy
forum-goers, as well as cases where forums deter them from
conducting IPS. Our work is already impacting anti-IPS inter-
ventions by informing programs that directly assist victims.
