1.3.3 Non-Ownership
Recall the example from the beginning: the chef with his staff and equipment
movedoutofthearistocrat’shouse,openedarestaurantandcouldthenofferedhis
capabilitiestohisformeremployerortoothercustomersasaservice. Nothinghas
changedintheactivitiesofthekitchenandintheutilizationofresourcesexcept
thattheresourcesnolongerbelongtothearistocrat.

The non-ownership characteristic of services has early been recognized by
researchers[40,41]. “Yetsubsequenttheorizinghaslargelyignoredthisstriking
characteristic” ([42], p. 34). Lovelock and Gummesson [42] propose a “fresh
perspective” on services considering non-ownership or rental/access – and not
intangibility–asthemaindifferentiatorofservicesandgoods. Inthemeantime,
thetreatmentofnon-ownershiphasfounditswayintoservicemanagementand
marketingtextbooks[43,44].
Outsourcing
Amodernwayofdescribingthisapproachofgivingupresourcesanddemanding
thembackasaservicewithoutownershipiscalledoutsourcing. Companieshave
begunmanyyearsagotooutsourcetheircafeteria,theirsecuritypersonnel,their
facilitiesmanagement,andevenpartsoftheiradministrationtoserviceproviders.
Thereasonisalwaysthesame: companieswanttoturnfixedcostsintovariable
costsandpayfortheserviceonlyondemand. Non-ownershipgivesmoreflexibility

AnotherexampleisIToutsourcing,wherealltheITresourcesofacompany

ranging from infrastructure outsourcing over application management services
(AMS)tobusinessprocessoutsourcing(BPO).
Inthelastfewyears,IToutsourcinghasseenarenaissancewithtremendous
momentuminformofcloudservices.CloudservicesareITservicesmadeavailable
over the internet. The easy accessibility has made them attractive not only for
companies,butalsoforprivatecustomers. Itisagainaboutnon-ownership: auser
who previously had a license for a software product and had installed it on his

TheCultureofNon-Ownership
Evenifnon-ownershipisanoldphenomenon,thetrendtowardsitisstillonthe
rise. Notonlyhavethefirmsdiscoveredthebenefitsofnon-ownership,buttheir
intentionstousenon-ownershipserviceshasincreased[45]. Thewholesociety,
andespeciallytheyouth,isshiftingtowardsacultureofnon-ownership[46]. The
desireforownershipdecreasesandowningisreplacedbysharing[47,48]. Thiscan

hasresultedinnewkindsofservicesthatareknownason-demandservices(video-
on-demand)orstreamingservices(musicstreaming).
Example — Consumers want to rent their music, not to own it. When
Apple introduced their iPod and iTunes products in 2001, Steve Jobs still
arguedthatconsumerswanttoowntheirmusic,notrentit. Overadecadelater
it turned out that Steve Jobs was wrong. Musical subscription services like
SpotifyorDeezerarebecomingmoreandmoredominant.AccordingtoNielsen
SoundScan,CDsalesinthefirsthalfof2014havedroppeddown14.9%from
thefirsthalfof2013,anddigitaldownloads11.6%. Atthesametime,audio
andvideostreamingserviceshadastronggrowthof42%.
Whatstreamingservicesareformusicandvideo,arecloudservicesforsoftware
(software-as-a-service). Theyhavesimilareconomicmodels(on-demand,pay-per-
use) and are based on the non-ownership paradigm. Both cloud services and
streamingservicesareformsofelectronicserviceswhichwillbediscussedinthe

HybridOffering

A hybrid offering should not be confused with a pure service that includes

barrierstoeconomicactivities,andthetechnologicaladvancesincomputingand
telecommunicationshasenabledthecreationofwiderservicemarkets.
The term service is used to refer to a range of activities that is difficult to
encapsulate within a simple definition. The literature often associates the term
servicewithanactoraperformance,orwithachangeintheconditionofaperson
orofagoodbelongingtosomeeconomicunitunderaprioragreement.
Adefinitionbecomesevenmorecomplextofindsinceservicesarealsooften
difficulttoseparatefromthegoodswithwhichtheymaybeassociatedinvarying

Thedifferencesbetweengoodsandservicesarebasedonmanydifferentfactors
(e.g., absence of inventories, production and consumption is at the same time,
intangibility), which are becoming more and more acute as the services sector
expands. Thesedifferencesarealsobeingexploredbyusingbundling,amarketing
