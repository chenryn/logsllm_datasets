User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Ubuntu EC2 server not accepting key following OpenSSH upgrade I've just upgraded OpenSSH on an EC2 Ubuntu instance. 

sshd -V now gives: OpenSSH_6.6p1

previously showed: OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.3

However, I can no longer log in with the .pem file from Amazon. 

Its asking for a password, and auth.log shows me the following:

Sep  9 16:27:54 ip------0 sshd[31498]: rexec line 89: Unsupported option UsePAM
Sep  9 16:27:55 ip------0 sshd[31498]: User ubuntu not allowed because account is locked
Sep  9 16:27:55 ip------0 sshd[31498]: input_userauth_request: invalid user ubuntu [preauth]

Assistant: Try looking at the /etc/shadow file. I am sure you would see ! in the encrypted password column(2nd). I was able to resolve this issue by taking out the ! from the password column. BTW, the auth logs complain about the account locked. (and ! is normally used to lock the useraccount)

/etc/shadow

It would look something like above. You take off the ! in the second column and you should be able to login to the machine again as ubuntu user and the key used for it. 

You can do all the above steps by detaching the root volume of your current instance and attaching it to another test instance. 
Mount the volume as secondary drive and then edit the MOUNT/etc/shadow file.
