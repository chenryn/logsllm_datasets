User: How to display list of running processes Python with full name and active status?
I tried this command: pgrep -lf python
Assistant: You could also setup a "watch" in a separate window to constantly monitor Python processes as you run a script: watch -n 1 "ps u -C python3". Particularly useful when developing with multiprocessing.
