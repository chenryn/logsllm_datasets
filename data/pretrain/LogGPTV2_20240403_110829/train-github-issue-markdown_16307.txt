##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
Module `apt_key`
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.1.0
      config file = ./ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
    [defaults]
    inventory           = local.ini
    remote_user         = ansible
    hash_behaviour      = merge
    [ssh_connection]
    ssh_args            = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=90s
    control_path        = .ssh/%%h-%%p-%%r.master
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Ansible runs from Debian Stretch and is managing Debian Jessie nodes.
##### SUMMARY
I am reopening #6693 which was closed due to repos migration.
I have encountered the same issue: a apt key gets expired and Ansible won't
update it. Due to lack of the update feature apt wasn't possible to update
cache and install/upgrade packages.
I need to workaround this feature by running `ansible` ad-hoc command removing
this apt key and then running the _playbook_ again.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
      - name: Fusion directory apt key
        apt_key:
          id: 62B4981F
          keyserver: 'keys.gnupg.net' 
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
When the key expires, download it again to check if new one is available.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Nothing changed, Ansible reports `OK`.
