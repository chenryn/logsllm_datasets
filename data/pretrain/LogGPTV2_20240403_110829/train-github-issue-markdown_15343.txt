### First check
  * I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
  * I used the GitHub search to find a similar issue and didn't find it.
  * I searched the FastAPI documentation, with the integrated search.
  * I already searched in Google "How to X in FastAPI" and didn't find any information.
  * I already read and followed all the tutorial in the docs and didn't find an answer.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to Pydantic.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to Swagger UI.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to ReDoc.
  * After submitting this, I commit to one of: 
    * Read open issues with questions until I find 2 issues where I can help someone and add a comment to help there.
    * I already hit the "watch" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.
    * Implement a Pull Request for a confirmed bug.
### Example
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    from typing import Optional
    app = FastAPI()
    class MyResponseAmbiguous(BaseModel):
        a: Optional[int]
    @app.get("/ambiguous", response_model=MyResponseAmbiguous)
    def ambiguous():
        # swagger shows ``a`` as type int, even though it can be None
        return MyResponseAmbiguous(a=1)
    class MyResponseNullable(BaseModel):
        a: Optional[int] = Field(..., nullable=True)
    @app.get("/nullable", response_model=MyResponseNullable)
    def nullable():
        # swagger shows ``a`` as type int, and also says it can be nullable.
        return MyResponseNullable(a=1)
### Description
When generating an openapi schema, FastAPI does not mark `Optional` items as
nullable - as in the `MyResponseAmbiguous` model above.  
To mark an item as nullable in openapi you need to manually pass
`nullable=True` to the pydantic Field function - as in the
`MyResponseNullable` model above.  
How can this be done automatically?
Additionally, one of the models has `a` marked as required (red asterisk) and
the other does not - is this the intended behaviour? I think it should be
marked as required in both models.
