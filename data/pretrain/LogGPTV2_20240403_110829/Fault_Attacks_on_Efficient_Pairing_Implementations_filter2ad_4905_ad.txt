Notice that we can assume that we know the number of
iterations executed. This is a realistic assumption because
we can guess this value which is smaller than 255. This will
just multiply the attack time complexity by 256.
5. EXPERIMENTATION
The fault model used in this part is similar as in the pre-
vious attacks against the compressed pairing. The type of
faults consists in injecting faults to the loop counter. We can
stop the loop computation before its normal end and the al-
We have implemented our fault attack using Sage against
the C pairing implementation proposed by Naehrig et al.
in [26]. Knowing the number of iterations of Miller Loop,
we succeed to ﬁnish several tests for the case that the secret
646key is the ﬁrst argument or the second argument for the
pairing computation.
We show in the following tables, the results of experimen-
tations. We note each time the number of faults needed to
be injected to invert the pairing computation and the total
time for the execution of our attack.
Attack against the compressed pairing. The follow-
ing table shows the results of our simulations for recovering
the secret key when we invert the ﬁrst point of the pairing
computation.

We can notice that even we need to guess the number of
iterations executed in the Miller Loop, which will multiply
the time by 256 the attack is always realistic since we can
have more eﬃcient attack if the attack was programmed
in C. And all these computations are almost independent,
so the parallel computation is easy to apply for this attack
schema.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose two fault attacks to solve the in-
version pairing problem with the ﬁrst or second argument on
the compressed pairing implementation of Naehrig, Barreto
and Schwabe [26]. The ﬁrst attack is generic, independent on
the third exponentiation in the ﬁnal exponentiation of Tate
pairing, but requires a high number of faults (around 1000)
to fully invert the pairing. The second attack is tailored
for the speciﬁc implementation of Tate pairing on Barreto-
Naehrig Curve and is more eﬃcient since one fault is needed
to invert the Final exponentiation and less than 30 faults
are needed according our simulations. This corresponds to
the implementation of [26]. Finally, we reduce the attack on
standard implementation of Tate pairing such as the imple-
mentation of Devegili et al. in [11], developed in particular
for smartcard implementation, to our fault attack on com-
pressed pairing.
It is surprising that it seems diﬃcult to
attack the standard implementation, but once the fault at-
tack on compressed pairing is known, it seems easy to solve
it.
