### Ransomware Clustering and Analysis

#### Ransomware Families and Cluster IDs
- **CryptXXX, CryptoDefense, CryptoLocker, CryptoWall, Locky, Spora, WannaCry**: These ransomware families are grouped into clusters based on their behavior and the addresses they use for ransom payments.

| Ransomware Family | Cluster ID |
|-------------------|------------|
| CryptXXX          | 1          |
| CryptoDefense     | 1          |
| CryptoLocker      | 1          |
| CryptoWall        | 1          |
| Dharma            | 2          |
| Locky             | 1          |
| Spora             | 2          |
| WannaCry          | 1          |

#### Timeline of Ransomware Activity
- **Tmin (First Bitcoin Inflow)**: The earliest date a cluster received bitcoins.
- **Tmax (Last Bitcoin Inflow)**: The latest date a cluster received bitcoins.
- **Naddr (Number of Addresses in Cluster)**: The total number of addresses in each cluster.
- **Nseed (Number of Seed Addresses)**: The number of seed ransom addresses used to construct the cluster. "R" denotes real victims, and "S" denotes synthetic victims.

| Ransomware Family | Tmin       | Tmax       | Naddr  | Nseed  |
|-------------------|------------|------------|--------|--------|
| CryptXXX          | 2016-02-25 | 2017-08-31 | 8,526  | 1R 4S  |
| CryptoDefense     | 2012-11-03 | 2014-08-15 | 1,404  | 1R 1S  |
| CryptoLocker      | 2016-05-11 | 2016-10-06 | 1,742  | 1R 1S  |
| CryptoWall        | 2014-03-18 | 2014-08-05 | 1      | 1R 1S  |
| Dharma            | 2014-02-28 | 2017-06-29 | 968    | 1R 1S  |
| Locky             | 2013-09-07 | 2017-02-20 | 3,489  | 1R 28S |
| Spora             | 2016-03-07 | 2017-06-02 | 216    | 1R 1S  |
| WannaCry          | 2015-11-24 | 2017-08-26 | 10     | 1R 1S  |

#### Case Study: Cerber and Locky

**Cerber**
- **Synthetic Victims**: 32 synthetic victims were generated, and a micropayment of 0.001 BTC was made to each ransom address.
- **Aggregation Address**: After receiving the micropayment, the ransom address moved the funds to a unique aggregation address, which was then not used in any further transactions.
- **Cluster Construction**: The aggregation addresses were clustered to form Cerber's cluster. This resulted in a single cluster with 8,526 addresses.

**Locky**
- **Synthetic Victims**: 28 synthetic victims were generated, and a micropayment of 0.001 BTC was made to each ransom address.
- **Co-spending**: The ransom addresses were co-spent with other wallet addresses, leading to the construction of a single Locky cluster with 7,093 addresses.
- **Real Victim**: A real victim's ransom address, which paid 0.5 BTC, was also found to belong to the same Locky cluster, validating the micropayment approach.

#### Clustering Methodology
- **Micropayments**: Micropayments were made to seed ransom addresses to observe the flow of bitcoins and identify co-spending patterns.
- **Co-spending Heuristic**: If a ransom address and an aggregation address were co-spent, both were included in the same cluster.
- **Cluster Expansion**: For some families, such as Cerber and Locky, where each victim is assigned a unique ransom address, a small number of seed addresses led to large clusters. For others, like WannaCry and CryptoDefense, the same ransom addresses were reused, resulting in smaller clusters.

#### Limitations
- **Unpaid Ransom Addresses**: Unpaid ransom addresses, even from real victims, do not help in finding the ransomware's cluster because they have not been co-spent.
- **Operator Behavior**: Ransomware operators may ignore micropayments or switch to new wallet clusters, making it difficult to track all addresses.
- **Affiliate Model**: Some ransomware families operate in an affiliate model, where each affiliate uses a disjoint cluster of addresses, potentially missing some clusters.

#### Coverage and Validation
- **Google Trends and VirusTotal**: To validate the clustering, we compared the timing of bitcoin inflows with Google search trends and the discovery of new binaries on VirusTotal.
- **Dataset Construction**: A dataset of over 294k ransomware binaries was constructed using YARA rules and code-structure similarity scores to identify and cluster related binaries.

#### Conclusion
The clustering approach, while effective in identifying large clusters for some ransomware families, has limitations due to operator behavior and the nature of the ransomware operations. Future work could involve more sophisticated methods to detect and track all clusters, especially in the context of affiliate models and changing operational strategies.
