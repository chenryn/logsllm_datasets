User: As I can do to stop the service and tt solr correctly. What I do is restart the PC and then wake up services, but to perform validation of a song, I get a message as if the database has been damaged. I wonder what is the right way to close the service to run and test after songs but not the database is damaged. Greetings and thanks.

Start the tts   / usr/local/tokyotyrant-1.1.33/bin/ttservercd echoprint-server/solr/solr
java -Dsolr.solr.home=/home/user01/echoprint-server/solr/solr/solr/
-Djava.awt.headless=true -DSTOP.PORT=8079 -DSTOP.KEY=mykey -jar start.jar
Ingest new song
I stop Solr    java -DSTOP.PORT=8079 -DSTOP.KEY=mykey -jar start.jar
--stop

Now, when I start the service and I want to make a song compracion some that I have in the database sends me an error.
Traceback (most recent call last): File "lookup.py", line 51, in lookup (sys.argv [1]) File "lookup.py", line 35, in lookup result = fp.best_match_for_query (decoded) File ".. / API / fp.py ", line 194, in best_match_for_query get_tyrant tcodes = (). multi_get (trackids) File".. / API / pytyrant.py ", line 296, in multi_get raise KeyError (" Missing a result, unusable response in 1.1.10 ") KeyError: 'Missing a result, unusable response in 1.1.10'
How should initiate and terminate service without losing any information.?
Assistant: well I found my mistake and if the ttserver. Thanks Alexandre for that data. Well the right way to make it work would be this
/usr/local/tokyotyrant-1.1.33/bin/ttserver casket.tch
there indicated the name of the on-disk hash, that will make persistent. Then start Solr normally and I can enter and view songs without problems :)
