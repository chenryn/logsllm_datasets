HoneycombHoneycomb is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Honeycomb’s service comprises a data store and query engine optimized for exploratory identification and investigation of patterns and anomalies in application and infrastructure telemetry. Honeycomb is thus more observability-focused than APM and is delivered as a SaaS product. Its clients are global, but are concentrated in North America and EMEA. Recent updates havestrengthened support for OpenTelemetry, added an API for data exchange and introduced metrics. Honeycomb’s roadmap includes a service-mapping capability, service-level objective (SLO) enhancements and tailoring the product for enterprise use.
Strengths■	Innovative analytics: Honeycomb enables operators to quickly identify interesting 	anomalies in the collected telemetry. In particular, the “BubbleUp” tool is a novel 	innovation that visually represents data in a heat map in a way that clearly identifies 	correlated anomalies, enabling the operator to interactively explore the different 	dimensions of this data. This reduces the amount of time the operator needs to 	spend manually analyzing the data.Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 11 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■	Integrated reliability workflows: Honeycomb includes native support for defining 	service-level indicators (SLIs) and measuring service-level objectives (SLOs) and 	burn rate in a way that ties them directly to the telemetry that defines them and 	informs cause analysis.■	Community engagement: Honeycomb’s commitment to community building and 	outreach efforts are noteworthy. Some of these efforts include a free tier of service, 	community events, open office hours and one book (so far). The modern use of 	observability outside of its control theory origins can largely be traced to 
	Honeycomb’s founders.
CautionsHoneycomb’s founders.
Cautions
■	Single location: Honeycomb’s service is delivered from the AWS us-east-1 (Northern 	Virginia) region. This may prove limiting in the future, not only from a latency 	perspective, but because there may be organizations for which secure tenancy is not 	sufficient or that want an observability platform closer to their applications.■	Uniqueness of offering: Honeycomb’s product differs significantly from traditional 	APM solutions, making it difficult for end users to explain its purpose as part of the 	business case to obtain approval to procure it.
■	Pricing rigidity: The tiered pricing plan is rigidly volume-based between tiers. 	Demands for flexibility are likely to increase as the customer base grows.
IBM (Instana)IBM is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. IBM acquired Instana in 2020, and its Instana APM product is offered as a SaaS product and as a self-hosted option, using a single-agent architecture. Its operations are mostly focused in North America and Western Europe, with a smaller number of clients in other regions. Its client base is midsize-to-large enterprises. IBM’s position and capacity in monitoring has substantially improved with its recent acquisitions. IBM Instana’s roadmap includes further integration for Turbonomic (another acquisition) and IBM Z Mainframe, as well as further support for OpenTelemetry and Kubernetes.Strengths
■	Simple pricing model: IBM Instana’s pricing model, based on a per-host metric, is 	straightforward to understand and is competitively priced in the market. Pricing 	varies for the SaaS version, compared with the on-premises model, and list prices are 	available on the Instana website.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 12 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.■	IBM client base: The IBM acquisition gives Instana access to a wider audience and a 	larger sales team. It also enables Instana to target legacy IBM installations for 	modernization.
■	Designed for modern architectures: Instana APM is focused on monitoring for 	containerized and hybrid environments and is suitable for clients looking for an APM 	solution, with an emphasis on monitoring modern infrastructure.Cautions
■	No synthetics, no integrated security: Instana APM has no integrated synthetic 	monitoring, relying instead on third-party tools, such as Apica, to provide this 	functionality. An integrated synthetics tool is on the IBM Instana roadmap. Similarly, 	Instana lacks an integrated security tool, so it relies on other IBM tools, such as 	StackRox, to provide such functionality.■	Unclear transition from legacy IBM: There are still large deployments of legacy IBM 	monitoring tools, including those from the Tivoli portfolio. Clients are unsure of the 	upgrade paths available to them, and the value of upgrading remains unclear. IBM 	has initiated activities to help clients with the transition process.■	Lack of ServiceNow integration: Unlike most tools, Instana does not have an out-of-	the-box offering to integrate with ServiceNow, the leading IT service management 	(ITSM) solution on the market. Instead, it relies on custom integration via webhooks.
Logz.ioLogz.io is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and observability product set includes distributed tracing, infrastructure monitoring and log management. Logz.io leverages the Prometheus-compatible M3DB for metrics and OpenSearch for logs and traces. OpenTelemetry is used to collect trace data, which is visualized in Jaeger. A cloud security information and event management (SIEM) capability is available as well. All are delivered as SaaS-only solutions, hosted in multiple cloud providers. Its operations are geographically diversified, and its clients tend to be open-source-friendly enterprises of any size. Logz.io’s roadmap includes a simplified agent architecture, service mapping and improved AI/ML. Digital experience monitoring is also planned.Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 13 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■	Open source: Logz.io heavily leverages OSS throughout its product set. It 
	demonstrates how organizations interested in following a similar path for their own 	use can better understand the capabilities of the components. Organizations that 	have found self-managing these tools to be onerous and costly may wish to migrate 	to Logz.io to reduce their overhead.■	Geographic footprint: With at least two points of presence in each of the North 	America, EMEA and the APAC regions distributed across two cloud providers, Logz.io 	offers wide geographic diversity and support for data sovereignty.
■	Cost-effective data management: With Logz.io’s Smart Tier, as log data is ingested 	or aged, it can be placed into one of three tiers that help balance availability, 	performance and cost.Cautions
■	UI consistency: Because Logz.io is literally a collection of OSS deployed together, 	variations in user interface (UI) as you switch between perspectives are apparent, 	and may be confusing to end users.
■	Forked open source: To create the Logz.io products, many of the underlying open-	source components have been forked, although to what degree is unclear. This has 	the potential to create latency in the incorporation of security remediations.■	Agent sprawl: As currently implemented, separate client-side agents may be required 	to transmit different types of telemetry to the Logz.io platform. For example, 	Prometheus or Telegraf for time series, Fluentd or Fluent Bit for log data, and an 	OpenTelemetry collector for traces. This increases complexity and adds to 
	administrative burden.
ManageEngineadministrative burden.
ManageEngine
ManageEngine is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. The company is the IT 
management division of privately held Zoho Corp., and its Applications Manager and Site24x7 products focus on on-premises and SaaS deployments, respectively. The company’s operations are geographically diversified, and its clients tend to be small or midsize businesses (SMBs). ManageEngine’s roadmap includes a focus on increasing its support for OpenTelemetry as a standard, improving log file analysis, expanding DEM capabilities, and integrating AIOps for analysis and noise reduction.Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 14 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■	Investment from parent company: Zoho, the parent company of ManageEngine, is 	making a number of investments in AI solutions, from which ManageEngine should 	benefit.
■	SMB-optimized option: ManageEngine’s products are competitively priced and 	straightforward to implement for smaller enterprises with limited budgets and staff.■	Ecosystem of tools: ManageEngine’s portfolio of products extends the company’s 	capabilities beyond APM to include IT operations functions, such as network 	monitoring, infrastructure and ITSM help desk.
Cautions
■	Scalability: ManageEngine solutions have a small market footprint and are rarely 	seen in large organizations. Gartner clients have mentioned issues with scaling the 	solution for complex and/or large environments.■	Variable integration capability: ManageEngine has a long list of integrations, but 	many are limited in scope, making integrations with other areas of IT, such as 	DevOps toolchains, lengthy and more complex.
■	Immature analytics: The lack of integrated AI/ML capabilities in ManageEngine’s 	offering was apparent during this research. This is an area in which it noticeably 	lags the competition.Microsoft
Microsoft is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its Azure Monitor includes Application Insights for APM and Log Analytics for observability. Delivery is via SaaS. As theMicrosoft Azure-native monitoring solution, there is substantial geographic diversity, and clients tend to be midsize-to-large enterprises. Microsoft’s APM roadmap includes broader support for OpenTelemetry, managed Prometheus and Grafana, and advanced problem analysis based on AI. Microsoft’s roadmap also includes enhancing synthetic monitoring with screen capture and increasing support for on-premises and multicloud observability with Azure ARC.Strengths
■	Service mapping: Application Map automatically creates a topological 
	representation of distributed applications and their dependencies. Nodes on the map 	provide health and status information, and support drill-down to additional levels of 	detail.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 15 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.■	Data analytics: Microsoft Azure Monitor Log Analytics enables the interactive 	exploration of ingested telemetry, using a language called KQL. Most APM use cases 	require only Application Insights, but more-complex problem identification and 	behavior analysis may require the use of KQL.■	Consumption-based pricing: Microsoft Azure Monitor pricing is based primarily on 	daily ingested data, which customers can manage, depending on the type and 	amount of data being ingested into the Azure Monitoring platform, especially for 	larger deployments.
CautionsCautions
■	Limited adoption of monitoring outside of Azure: Microsoft has positioned Azure 	Monitor as a solution for monitoring workloads hosted outside Azure and those 	hosted in other cloud providers. Adoption of Azure Monitor for use outside of Azure 	has been limited, and potential clients should carefully evaluate whether Azure 	Monitor can provide the same benefits as a dedicated solution.■	Cost predictability: Azure Monitor is priced based on consumption, as is common 	with public-cloud-based services. The number of consumable services and the 	complexity of the levers involved makes comparison with other vendors difficult.
■	UI complexity: Microsoft Azure Monitor’s UI has remained similar to previous years, 	and is falling behind competing products. Customer feedback states that the UI and 	the product lack intuitive workflows.New Relic
New Relic is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant. Its New Relic One platform covers many areas of observability, including infrastructure, APM and DEM. Its operations are 
geographically diversified, and its customers tend to be midsize-to-large enterprise organizations. New Relic’s roadmap focuses on improving integration with the application development life cycle and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools, a new security offering, and enhanced integrations with hyperscalers and other partners.Strengths
■	Business model and pricing: New Relic offers a clearly differentiated and disruptive 	pricing model in the field that has contributed to its recent growth in the number of 	accounts. Pricing is based on the number of users and the volume of telemetry 	ingested, which overcomes many of the challenges associated with element-based 	pricing. This model is increasingly resonating with clients looking to manage ever-	increasing monitoring bills.Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 16 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■	Developer tools: Launched in early 2022, the core user license is targeted at 	developers and is based on its CodeStream acquisition. Developers can investigate 	problems in production from their usual integrated development environment (IDE), 	allowing tighter integration between the production and development worlds.■	Support for open standards: New Relic has added enhanced support for a number 	of open standards, including OpenTelemetry, eBPF and Grafana. This move away 	from proprietary standards provides clients with greater flexibility in their 
	deployments.
Cautions
■	Security product: At the time of research, New Relic did not have a security product 	as part of its portfolio. In May 2022, New Relic announced its new Vulnerability 	Management tool.■	Licensing confusion: Most enterprises will purchase either the Pro or Enterprise 	license type from New Relic. However, Gartner clients have indicated that they are 	unsure which of the two license types is correct for them, leading to clients either 	under- or overprovisioning. In addition, there is no way to mix the two license types, 	which some clients find frustrating.■	Log management: New Relic have recently changed its log tool to automatically 	collect log files where the APM agent is deployed. Although this will allow for greater 	insights by combining application logs with APM metrics, clients should ensure that 	New Relic’s security controls are correctly enabled so that sensitive data (e.g., 	financial or health information) isn’t inadvertently collected. They should also 	monitor telemetry consumption, because log files are significantly more verbose 	than metric data.Oracle
Oracle is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its Oracle Cloud Observability and Management (O&M) platform is a SaaS solution that supports database, infrastructure and APM generally within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and enterprise applications customer base. Its operations are geographically diversified, and its clients tend to be midsize-to-large organizations, including government agencies. The roadmap for O&M APM, a relatively new product, includes augmented ML/AI-based anomaly detection and improved support for hybrid and multicloud workloads.Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 17 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■	Flexible ingestion: In addition to its own agents, tracers and APIs, O&M supports 	ingesting telemetry in industry-standard formats, such as OpenMetrics 
	(Prometheus), OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing.■	Broad geographic coverage: Because of Oracle’s worldwide, direct presence, 	customers and prospects can access O&M services on a wide geographic basis.
■	Full-featured synthetic monitoring: O&M includes extremely flexible synthetic 	monitoring that supports browser and API-based, multistep transactions.
Cautions
■	Limited APM-specific go-to-market: OCI is the full suite of Oracle cloudinfrastructure services, and O&M is the full OCI monitoring platform. Its APM product 	is a small part of this broader platform. Similar to other third-party APM providers, it 	does not have a specific go-to-market (GTM) strategy. This may limit the broader 	growth potential of O&M outside the OCI ecosystem.■	Oracle-centric pricing model: As with other portfolio vendors with vast product 	offerings, Oracle’s pricing model of universal credits is optimized for its customer 	base, limiting the appeal for non-Oracle customers and prospects looking for stand-	alone APM solutions.
■	Language support: The set of languages for which a native agent is available 	comprises Java, JavaScript (Node), .NET (CLR) and Ruby.Riverbed (Aternity)
Riverbed (Aternity) is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Aternity, launched as a separate entity in 2019, was recently reunified with Riverbed. Aternity’s Digital Experience Management platform is focused on endpoint visibility, as well as back-endinstrumentation. Its operations focus mainly on North America, with an additional market in Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Its clients tend to be midsize-to-large organizations. Aternity’s roadmap for APM is focused heavily on unified observability, with a combined offering from Riverbed and Aternity. The company also plans to add continued 
enhancement support for open telemetry and serverless environments.On 28 April, Riverbed announced a new product offering Alluvio, which will comprise elements of Aternity, combined with Riverbed NPM and ITIM. Alluvio was not evaluated for this research.
Strengths
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 18 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.■	Benchmarking of data: Aternity provides benchmark data for various metrics that 	enable clients to easily see where and how they compare with their peers. These can 	be viewed by industry, geography and other categories.
■	DEM capability and focus: Aternity has extensive DEM agent-based capabilities that, 	when integrated with the company’s APM functionality, provide an end-to-end view 	of application traffic and detailed endpoint visibility.■	Integration: Bringing Aternity back into the Riverbed portfolio creates opportunities 	to grow through customer base expansion and greater access to additional 	development and operational resources.
Cautions
■	Aternity and Riverbed reintegration: Aternity was spun off from its parent company 	Riverbed in 2019. It has recently been brought back into the organization. This 	reintegration and uncertainty have caused clients to be hesitant about adopting 	Aternity products.■	No security capability or product: Aternity lacks products that add security to the 	APM portfolio.
■	Low market awareness: Aternity has a significant focus on the DEM aspect of APM, 	with less market awareness of its core APM capabilities.
SolarWinds
SolarWinds is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM product set is focused on providing services via SaaS and on-premises monitoring. Its operations are geographically diverse, and its clients include small organizations, large global enterprises andgovernmental organizations. SolarWinds’ roadmap includes plans for a new observability suite that combines all the functionality of the separate tools in a single SaaS package. Other enhancements include new AIOps capabilities.
Strengths
■	Breadth of coverage: SolarWinds has a strong complementary suite of products, 	covering much of the typical IT operations workload. These include products for 	network, database, security and configuration management.Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 19 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■	Pricing: SolarWinds’ new integrated bundle will mean that APM pricing is more 	attractive for clients looking for an integrated solution for monitoring. In particular, it 	is likely to be an attractive option for companies looking to implement APM with a 	limited budget.■	Ease of use: SolarWinds has designed many of its products to be self-service, with 	simple installation models for smaller deployments.
Cautions
■	Ongoing impact of supply chain attack: SolarWinds continues to be affected by the 	SUNBURST hack of December 2020. Gartner notes that some clients, and especially 	government bodies, are not considering SolarWinds as a possible solution, due to its 	association with the attack.■	Lack of integration: SolarWinds’ APM product suite suffers from a lack of 
	integration among suite offerings, with a noticeable difference in user experience 	among suite products, as well as with other SolarWinds products, such as Orion. As 	noted, SolarWinds plans to launch a new, integrated observability suite later in 2022.■	Portfolio overlap: SolarWinds’ portfolio contains a number of overlapping products 	with similar capabilities. It is not always clear which SolarWinds tool is the most 	suitable for a particular use case.
SplunkSplunk is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM products combine metrics, traces and log analysis, end-user experience and incident response capabilities through various products aggregated in its Splunk Observability Cloud offering. Its operations are geographically diverse, and its clients tend to be enterprise organizations. The company continues to invest in its APM functionality by enhancing code-level visibility and acquisitions focused on enhancing its offerings in areas, such as real user monitoring, synthetic transaction monitoring (STM), cloud network monitoring and business workflows. A key aspect of the roadmap is gaining deeper monitoring and security insights with Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise integration with Splunk Log Observer.Strengths
■	Support for the large environments: Splunk has a large presence in log monitoring 	and SIEM, which enables it to introduce and cross-sell APM solutions to existing 	customers.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 20 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.■	Continuous visibility of code-level performance: Splunk’s APM Service Map clearly 	shows the topological relationships of the services affected during an error or 	outage. The code profiler visualizes bottlenecks in code and performs deeper 	examinations of spans to optimize the performance of applications.■	OpenTelemetry support: The Splunk APM is OpenTelemetry-native, making the 	product simple and intuitive. This makes the Splunk APM effective for cloud-native, 	service-based and mesh app and service architecture (MASA) applications.
Cautions
■	Complex licensing structure: Splunk introduced simplified single SKU pricing for 	Observability Cloud. When purchased alongside Splunk Enterprise, however, pricing 	can be complex and relatively high, especially for low volumes of hosts.■	Lacking full integration: Splunk is still working to integrate its entire suite of APM 	and observability offerings with Splunk Synthetics (Rigor) and Cloud Network 	monitoring (Flowmill) not yet integrated. Some clients have expressed confusion on 	the need for two separate log solutions (Log Observer and Splunk Cloud).■	Geographic presence: Splunk Observability Cloud does not have a point of presence 	in the APAC region. Splunk Observability’s regional availability is expected to expand 	in the coming year from the U.S./EMEA (via AWS/GCP) to APAC.
Sumo LogicSumo Logic is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its Observability platform is focused on providing availability, performance and security analysis via SaaS monitoring. Its operations are geographically diverse, and its clients include enterprise and midmarket segments. Sumo Logic’s roadmap includes enhancing analytics coverage within alert response, enhancing tracing and RUM capabilities, and embracing open source with contributions to OpenTelemetry.Strengths
■	Pricing model: Sumo Logic’s pricing model is based on capacity, credit and data 	tiering. This makes it easy for clients to analyze and manage costs as their data 	grows. Sumo Logic contracts are essentially drawdown contracts, in which clients 	purchase credits that may be used for any product in the portfolio.
