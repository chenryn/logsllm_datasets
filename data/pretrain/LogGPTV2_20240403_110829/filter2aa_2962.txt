“Hackers Attack Every 39 Seconds”   
“One in Three Americans Hacked in the Past Year “ 
“Cyber crime damage costs to hit $6 trillion annually by 2021” 
“Around one billion accounts and records were compromised worldwide in 2016 “ 
“Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which 
is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021” 
On the other hand..

So, why that’s the situation?  
+ Because we compare instead of 
cooperate 
+ Because every single security product is 
built in a way it’s the only product installed 
in customer’s network 
+ Because customer has to build a cyber 
defense ecosystem from products that 
weren’t built to be a part of an ecosystem

High FP rate – Why it happens?  
According to Cisco 2017 Security Capabilities 
Benchmark Study: 
“Organizations can investigate only  
56 percent of the security alerts 
they receive on a given day”

To Alert or Not to Alert? 
I see a suspicious JS, but can’t 
analyze it properly..  
So, will I miss a possible attack  
or  
Create possible false positive?  
Dilemma…

What if it would work this way.. 
“Hey folks, found a fishy file 
sending some traffic to 
suspicious domain. Anyone 
can take a look?” 
“Hi there, scanned it. 
Don’t worry, it’s benign, on 
my whitelist”

Seeing all together is an utopia? 
Interactive Conversation instead on One way Street 
-
Ability to answer questions vs triggering alerts 
Automatic Investigation 
     - Investigation of every single lead is too much for human

First Steps to this direction 
Security Automation and Orchestration 
-
Automating some time and effort 
consuming tasks 
-
Enriching data with internal and 
external sources  
Good start, but not enough!   
Let’s look further !
