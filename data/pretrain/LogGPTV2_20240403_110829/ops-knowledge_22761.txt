User: I am writing now writing some evented code (In python using gevent) and I use the nginx as a web server and I feel both are great. I was told that there is a trade off with events but was unable to see it. Can someone please shed some light?

Assistant: The only difficulty of evented programming is that you mustn't block, ever. This can be hard to achieve if you use some libraries that were designed with threads in mind. If you don't control these libraries, a fork() + message ipc is the way to go.
