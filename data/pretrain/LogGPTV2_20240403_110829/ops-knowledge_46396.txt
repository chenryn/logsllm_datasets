User: I have a python script that runs continuously as a WebJob (using Microsoft Azure), it generates some values (heart beat rate) continuously, and I want to display those values in my Web App.
I don't know how to proceed to link the WebJob to the web app.
Any ideas ?
Assistant: You would need to provide some more information about what kind of interface your web app exposes. Does it only handle normal HTTP1 requests or does it have a web socket or HTTP2 type interface? If it has only HTTP1 requests that it can handle then you just need to make multiple requests or try and do long polling. Otherwise you need to connect with a web socket and stream the data over a normal socket connection.
