In AngularJS, `ng-repeat` can iterate `Object` as key-value map.
https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat
` ... `
In Angular2, `ngFor` doesn't support it. `ngFor` can iterate only an array.

This mismatch makes migrations a little difficult.
I think `ngFor` also support `Object` iteration as well as `ng-repeat`.
