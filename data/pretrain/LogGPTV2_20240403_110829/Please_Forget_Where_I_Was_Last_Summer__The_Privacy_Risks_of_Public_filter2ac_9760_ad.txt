|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| [45]   | 72.3%    | 67.8%    |          |          |
| [34]   | 72.1%    | 66.4%    | 69.3%    | 54.7%    |

| [19], [20], [34], [39] | 44.1%    | 26.4%    | 37.5%    | 20.9%    |
| This Paper | 73.1%    | 64.9%    | 50.9%    | 65%      |
| [25]   | 33.2%    | 48.9%    | 18.5%    | 22.8%    |
| [43]   | 32.2%    | 30.4%    | 55%      | 57.6%    |

### Experimental Results

- **Prior Work:**
  - Our techniques outperform all heuristics proposed in prior work for both home and work locations.
  - The simplistic approach of selecting the largest cluster as the home performs surprisingly well.
  - Heuristics (4) and (8) perform better than other prior heuristics.
  - The approaches in [43] rely on weights obtained from their data; we replicated their approach using a 22% sample dataset to calculate the weights.

- **Improvements:**
  - Our techniques present an improvement of 18.9%-91.6% for inferring homes and 8.7%-21.8% for workplaces.
  - LPAuditor’s home inference still outperforms all previous approaches, even in the Low datasets.
  - Second-level clustering significantly enhances the accuracy of our system by grouping data points that belong to the same location but have been assigned to nearby locations due to user mobility or GPS errors.

### Sensitive Place Inference

- **LPAuditor Detected:**
  - 6,483 potentially sensitive clusters (PSCs) across the ground truth.
  - 938 PSCs were identified, with 464 users having PSCs.

- **Content-Based (CB) Identification:**
  - 328 true positives, 368 false positives, and 96 false negatives.
  - Precision: 79.31%, Recall: 93.63%, F-Score: 85.87%.

- **Duration-Based (DB) Identification:**
  - 691 users from the Home-Top and 205 from the Home-Low dataset visited 1,699 and 276 PSCs respectively.
  - 3,012 and 1,672 users from the Top-6K and Low-10K datasets visited 7,020 and 2,337 PSCs respectively.

- **Common CB/DB Clusters:**
  - 53.44% and 53.9% of the PSCs detected by the content-based approach are among the visited clusters returned by the duration-based approach for the Home-Top and Top-6K datasets.
  - 44.44% and 47.25% of the clusters detected with the content-based approach have also been detected by the duration-based approach for the Home-Low and Low-10K datasets.

### Conclusion

- **Privacy Implications:**
  - Location metadata can undermine privacy-conscious user behavior by exposing sensitive information.
  - Even low confidence levels may be sufficient for certain attackers, such as insurance companies looking at user profiles.

- **Future Work:**
  - Further refinement of second-level clustering and integration of additional corroboration methods to enhance the accuracy and robustness of sensitive place inference.
