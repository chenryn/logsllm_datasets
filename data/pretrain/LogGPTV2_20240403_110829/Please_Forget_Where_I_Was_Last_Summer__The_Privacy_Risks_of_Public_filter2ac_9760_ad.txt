is well known within certain communities), this experiment
highlights another potential threat posed by location metadata.
Prior work. Apart from pinpointing locations with a gran-
ularity that is orders of magnitude more ﬁne-grained than prior
work, it is important to also quantify the accuracy improve-
ments of our techniques. We implement the heuristics proposed
in prior work for identifying home and work locations that
leverage spatiotemporal patterns and apply them to our ground
truth; we do not compare to techniques that require other types
of data, like social ties [37], [36], as we do not collect such
data and those techniques are inherently very coarse-grained.
By running these heuristics on the same data, we are able to
conduct a direct comparison to previous techniques and avoid
the inaccuracy of simply comparing to their reported numbers.
It is important to note that we map tweets to postal addresses
before applying these previously-proposed heuristics, i.e., we
only apply our initial ﬁrst-level clustering so as to remain as
faithful as possible to their original design.
As Table III shows, LPAuditor outperforms all heuristics
proposed in prior work for both home and work locations. The
simplistic approach of selecting the largest cluster as the home
(1) performs surprisingly well, and even outperforms some of
the other more complex heuristics. We also extended this logic
and evaluated the precision of considering the second largest
cluster as the workplace (14); this results in a precision of
18.45% and 22.82% in the Work-Top and Work-Low datasets
respectively. Heuristics (4) and (8) perform better than other
prior heuristics. The approaches proposed in [43] rely on
weights obtained from their data; to remain faithful to their
design, we replicate their approach and randomly select 22%
of our users as the sample dataset to calculate the weights and
the rest as the evaluation dataset. The signiﬁcant difference
between their reported accuracy and our ﬁndings can be
attributed to their experiments being conducted on a dataset
from a very limited time frame and geographic area.
Our techniques present an improvement of 18.9%-91.6%
when inferring homes and 8.7%-21.8% for workplaces. In-
terestingly, in multiple cases LPAuditor presents a larger im-
provement over prior approaches for users that are not proliﬁc
geotaggers (i.e., from the Low datasets), indicating the beneﬁt
of our techniques when there is sparser availability of data.
To accurately quantify the effect of our second-level clus-
tering we also run our heurstics using only the ﬁrst-level
clustering. LPAuditor’s home inference still outperforms all
previous approaches, both in the Home-Top and Home-Low
datasets, with an improvement of 0.4%-73.1%. On the con-
trary, heuristic (14) outperforms LPAuditor’s work inference
in both Work-Top and Work-Low datasets, by 1% and 18.5%
respectively. These differences can be attributed to the fact that
when a user’s location cluster is split into smaller (i.e. ﬁrst-
level) clusters, our heuristics cannot entirely capture the true
behavior of that location, which further signiﬁes the impor-
tance of our second-level clustering. As aforementioned, other
locations frequented by users during or near working hours
can exhibit work-like characteristics (e.g., gym, coffee shopts
etc.) affecting ﬁne-grained approaches like ours when working
with sporadic location datasets. Our second-level clustering
allows our system to group data points that belong to the
same location but have been assigned to nearby locations due
to the displacement introduced by user mobility (e.g., tweeting
while leaving work) or GPS errors. In a sense, this can be seen
as enhancing the “signal”, thus allowing our system to better
capture the user’s behavior in each location. After applying
our second-level clustering, our results improve signiﬁcantly
by 18.5% and 23.6% for Home-Top and Home-Low and by
22.8% and 27.2% for Work-Top and Work-Low respectively.

user’s online proﬁle to decide on adjusting their premium or
purchasing their policy [6]. Nonetheless, as an extra source of
ground truth, we identiﬁed users’ tweets that were generated by
the Foursquare app and followed the typical format of a check-
in; we then compared the venues of these check-ins to the
clusters of sensitive nearby venues. This allowed us to verify
certain detected sensitive places irrespective of the content
posted from these clusters. This returned 105 sensitive clusters
for our ground truth users, 20 of which were also detected by
tf-idf. While this source of ground truth is considerably
small, it offers an interesting indication of user behavior; users
are extremely reserved when it comes to explicitly publishing
that they are at a sensitive location. This further exempliﬁes
the implications of the location metadata being exposed, as it
directly undermines privacy-conscious user behavior.
To further investigate tweeting behavior from sensitive
venues, we infer PSCs visited by the remaining users from
the Top-6K and Low-10K datasets. Our system identiﬁed
21,863 PSCs for 4,418 users from Top-6K and through CB
corroboration identiﬁed 1,512 of them as sensitive clusters that
were visited. Of those, 1,282 pertain to health, 196 to religion
and 34 to sex. Similarly for the users from Low-10K, we
identiﬁed 6,918 PSCs, with 474 being ﬂagged by our system,
with 341 related to health, 115 to religion, and 18 to sex.
Duration-based corroboration. When using the duration-
based approach (DB), as can be seen in Table V, we identiﬁed
691 users from the Home-Top and 205 from the Home-Low
dataset that have repeatedly visited or spent a considerable
amount of time at 1,699 and 276 PSCs respectively. Similarly,
in the Top-6K and Low-10K datasets, we identiﬁed 3,012 and
1,672 users that have visited 7,020 and 2,337 such places. It
should be noted though that these numbers constitute a lower-
bound estimation, as the duration-based approach does not take
into consideration PSCs that only contain a single tweet.
We observe that 53.44% and 53.9% of the PSCs detected
by the content-based approach (i.e., CB clusters) for the
Home-Top and Top-6K datasets respectively, are among the
visited clusters returned by the duration-based approach (DB
clusters). For the Home-Low and Low-10K datasets, 44.44%
and 47.25% of the clusters detected with the content-based
approach have been also detected by the duration-based ap-

venues belonging to a sensitive category.
(93.42%) Home-Top users with a total of 5,393 PSCs, and 516
(49.47%) users in Home-Low with 1,090 PSCs. This difference
between datasets is expected as users in the latter have fewer
geotagged tweets and considerably less clusters. Figure 8
breaks down the detected PSCs according to the category of the
associated venues. For PSCs that have more than one sensitive
venue in proximity, we ﬁrst assign that PSC to the category
of the closest venue. We also plot the distribution if each PSC
is mapped to all sensitive venues in proximity (denoted as
“Multiple attribution”). When only considering the sensitive
venue with the shortest distance to the PSC’s coordinates, we
identify 5,094 health-related clusters, and 918 and 471 venues
related to religion and sex/nightlife respectively. Interestingly,
if we intersect these clusters with users’ ground truth work
locations we ﬁnd 10 common instances in the Work-Low and
15 in the Work-Top sets; out of those only 3 from the latter set
were identiﬁed by our system through tf-idf. As such, we
believe that the vast majority of cases are users visiting these
sensitive venues, as opposed to working there.
Content-based corroboration. When using tf-idf and
our wordlists, we increase our conﬁdence in placing users
at 545 of the detected PSCs. To assess these results we
identiﬁed the clusters that contain at least one keyword from
the respective wordlists and manually inspected the clusters’
tweets, to assert whether the user was actually referring to
a sensitive place. This manual inspection showed that our
approach had an overall precision of 80.36% and a 93.79%
recall, as presented in Table IV. Out of the 438 veriﬁed
sensitive venues, 375 were related to health, 51 and 12 to
religion and sex respectively. We observed a small number of
false positives due to ambiguous keywords that remained in our
wordlists (e.g., “shot”); however, we kept these terms as the
true positives signiﬁcantly outweighed the false positives. Con-
trarily, in some cases our approach missed sensitive clusters
due to users that post sensitive content repeatedly from many
clusters (e.g., a religious user that tweeted religious content
from multiple locations), which resulted in these keywords
not being deemed signiﬁcant by tf-idf. Furthermore, it is
important to stress that we obtain a lower bound on the number
of sensitive venues that a user has visited, as the user may
simply post tweets that do not contain the appropriate context.
Depending on the attacker’s end goal, there might not be
a need for absolute certainty of whether the user visited the
sensitive place. Even low conﬁdence levels may be considered
a sufﬁcient indicator; e.g., an insurance company looking at a
