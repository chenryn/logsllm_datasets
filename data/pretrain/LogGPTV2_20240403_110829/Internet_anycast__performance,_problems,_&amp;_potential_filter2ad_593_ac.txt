### 4.1 Selecting Unicast Representatives

Unicast IP addresses used for the management of individual replicas are published for C-, K-, and L-root. For each site, we select one address as the unicast representative. We will evaluate whether this management address operates as a representative, as the network could be engineered to route management traffic differently from real queries.

Other root DNS servers, such as D-root, locate replicas at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). The Packet Clearing House (PCH) operates route collectors at more than 150 IXPs and releases the BGP routing tables collected from these route collectors. These routing tables provide us with other (unicast) prefixes that are reachable at the IXP. We choose an address from the smallest unicast prefix at an IXP as the unicast representative of the colocated anycast site.

#### 4.1.1 Goodness of Unicast Representative

Using the method described above, we selected unicast representatives for C-, D-, K-, and L-root. In this section, we evaluate how well these addresses represent their anycast sites by comparing the measured latency and path overlap between unicast and anycast sites.

- **C-Root**: Publishes management addresses for all replicas.
- **F-Root**: Publishes management addresses only for replicas not hosted by Cloudflare.
- **E-Root**: Uses PCH and does not publish management addresses, but recently started distributing via Cloudflare, making the IXP-based representative technique incomplete for E.
- **L-Root**: Omitted from evaluation results for space; the results for unicast representatives of L-root are similar to those of K-root.

This figure shows the distribution of RIPE Atlas queries over additional distance traveled compared to their closest sites.

### 4.2 AS Path Inference

Section 3 shows that anycast is often choosing poorly. By comparing the path to the chosen anycast site with the path to the representative address of a better site, we can determine where the two paths diverge. This divergence point, or "decision point," indicates where route selection failed, even though a direct path to a nearby site was available.

To locate the decision point, we need to infer AS-level paths from IP-level paths obtained from RIPE Atlas traceroutes. Direct use of BGP routing tables, as in CAIDA’s prefix-to-AS mapping, is challenging due to missing hops and multiple-origin conflicts. Here, we describe how to convert the traceroute path into an AS path suitable for comparison with other paths.

Mao et al. [29] proposed a heuristic method to improve IP-to-AS mapping. They collected traceroute and BGP tables from the same set of vantage points and identified processing steps over the sequence of IP addresses necessary to construct a match to the reference path from BGP. Their approach allows those without access to BGP data at a particular location to infer the BGP path associated with a readily-measurable traceroute path. We adopted the following four steps:

1. **Unresolved Hops Between Same AS**: If an unresponsive/unresolved IP hop from traceroutes is between two hops that map to the same AS, we assume the unmapped hop belongs to the same AS as the surrounding AS hops.
2. **Unresolved Hops Between Different ASes**: If an unresolved IP hop is between hops that map to different ASes, we use the domain name of the unresolved IP hop, if available, to associate it with a neighboring AS.
3. **Identify IXP Prefixes**: IP addresses assigned to IXPs may appear in traceroutes and introduce an extra AS hop relative to the corresponding BGP AS paths. We identify and remove such hops from the inferred AS path using Nomikos and Dimitropoulos' tool [34].
4. **Multiple Origin ASes (MOAS)**: Once a MOAS hop is found, we map it to a set of ASes. For the rest of the paper, we include these traceroutes in our comparison with other traceroutes. A traceroute hop “matches” with the corresponding hop in other traceroutes if the AS in the other path matches any one of the ASes associated with the MOAS hops.

Mao et al. [29] evaluated their IP-to-AS mapping algorithm. Only about 72% of traceroutes matched the corresponding BGP AS paths with basic IP-to-AS mapping using BGP tables. By applying these four steps to resolve the unmapped IP hops and IXP addresses, the matching rate increased to over 80%. Therefore, we expect that applying these processing steps will match the AS path with 80% accuracy, and this overall measure of agreement is a lower bound on the accuracy of suffixes of the path (after the decision point).

We do not consider traceroutes that cannot be completely resolved. If an unresponsive or unresolved IP hop lies between two different ASes, we abandon the comparison to other paths in the group we analyze below. This affects at least one traceroute from 20% of the probes for C and D root and from nearly half of the probes measuring K root, as described in more detail in §4.4.

### 4.3 Anycast and Unicast Path Inflation

Unicast routing is subject to path inflation, where the path taken is longer than necessary. Spring et al. [50] decomposed path inflation into topology and policy at the intra-domain, peering, and inter-domain levels, where each layer could add to the path distance either by incomplete topology (the lack of direct connections) or by policy (such as BGP preferences).

**Figure 6: Latency Comparison Between Unicast Representatives and Anycast Sites**

This figure shows how latency to the unicast representative differs from the latency to the anycast address for C-, D-, and K-root. L-root, not shown, was similar to K-root.

From RIPE’s built-in DNS CHAOS query measurements, we know which probe uses which site. We assign probes to measure the unicast representative address corresponding to the site it used, so a different number of probes may be used to measure different sites. For each root, we aim to use about 2000 probes to measure their corresponding anycast sites and unicast representatives. We distribute these probes across sites, limiting to at most 200 probes per site for C and D, 30 probes per site for the larger K and L. Some sites will see measurements from fewer probes if too few probes use that site for anycast.

From each probe, we send traceroutes to both the anycast address and to the unicast representative of the chosen site. This allows us to compare the AS paths and obtain latencies from a probe to the anycast address and to the unicast representative address. To account for ordinary variance, we also obtain the median anycast latency from the probe to the anycast address during the one-hour window (leveraging RIPE’s built-in ping measurements). In Figure 6, we compare the differences of our one-time measured latencies to the median anycast latency.

The traceroute data from the RIPE Atlas probes allow us to evaluate the similarity in AS level paths to anycast sites versus unicast representatives. Table 1 shows a sample of sites from different roots and the fraction of the AS path that matches. Unicast representatives show a close match overall, with over 90% for C, 90% for D, and 75% for K matching the AS paths. The AS path matches for C- and D-root were better than for K- and L-root. One difference is that C-root and D-root have single hosting ASes (Cogent and PCH) from which unicast representatives are drawn, while K-root and L-root have different hosting ASes at different sites. Recall that we do not expect complete agreement, as unicast and anycast addresses are in different prefixes that may be routed differently.
