## üêõ Bug
Running a 2d convolution (no padding, stride=1) on a 3x1 input, sliced from a
3x3 tensor, and a 3x1 weight, sliced from a 3x3 tensor. When trying to run it
on CPU the convolution result is wrong, but when moving to GPU (by adding
.cuda() after the tensors), the result is correct!
## To Reproduce
Run the code below to reproduce the bug. It's pretty self explanatory.
    import torch
    import torch.nn.functional as F
    x = torch.Tensor([[[[0., 2., 2.],
                        [0., 0., 1.],
                        [2., 0., 0.]]]])
    w = torch.Tensor([[[[1., 1., 0.],
                        [1., 0., 3.],
                        [0., 3., 1.]]]])
    x1 = x[:,:,:,2:] # Using only the last column from x, containing [2,1,0]
    w1 = w[:,:,:,2:] # Using only the last column from w, containing [0,3,1]
    #The result should be ((2*0) + (1*3) + (0*1)) = 3
    print(F.conv2d(x1, w1, None, padding=0, stride=1)) # tensor([[[[1.]]]]) WRONG!!!!
    print(F.conv2d(x1.cuda(), w1.cuda(), None, padding=0, stride=1)) # tensor([[[[3.]]]], device='cuda:0') as expected
## Expected behavior
As seen in the code above, the CPU gives the result of 1, when the actual
result should be 3.
