Execute the backup plan: perform data backup according to the established backup plan to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the backup data. 5. Test data recovery: perform a data recovery test to test whether the recovery process is smooth and the data is complete. 6. Regularly check and update: regularly check the integrity of the backup data and update it to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the backup files. 7. Establish an emergency recovery plan: restore data based on backup files, and establish an emergency recovery plan to quickly restore data in an emergency.
