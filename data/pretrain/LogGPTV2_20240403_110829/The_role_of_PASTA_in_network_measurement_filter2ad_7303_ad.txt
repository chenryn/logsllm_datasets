is an element of the product space F = [0, 1) × [0, 1). Assuming
independence between the streams, the joint probability P is just
P ((y, z) ∈ [a, b] × [c, d]) = PP (y ∈ [a, b]) · PT (z ∈ [c, d])
= (b − a)(d − c),
where b ≥ a, d ≥ c.
3.2.2 Ergodicity and Time Shifts
We will describe the stationarity and ergodicity of a point process
by means of the associated shift operator {θt}, which represents a
shift in time of value t ∈ R of the whole sample path of the process,
that is of all of its points. Stationarity is very simply expressed in
this framework: by deﬁnition, it holds if, for all t, a shift of t leaves
the law of the process unchanged. In order to deﬁne ergodicity, we
have to ﬁrst introduce the notion of invariant event.
An invariant event for a shift operator {θt}
Invariant Event:
(for instance that of a point process) is an event A such that A =
θ−t(A) for all t ∈ R. An example of such a event is a set of paths
each of which has an inﬁnite number of inter-arrivals larger than
some value x, because translation would not change this property
for any path in A, so θ−t(A) would contain exactly the same paths.
Ergodic Shift: A shift is ergodic if all of its invariant events are
trivial; i.e. of probability either 0 or 1. For instance, all stationary
renewal processes are ergodic (e.g., see Section 1.6 of Chapter 1
in [1]). In particular, a periodic point process with a random phase
that is uniform over the period is both stationary and ergodic.
Let us return to the product space deﬁned above. One can deﬁne
a product shift which operates, simultaneously but independently,
on both P and T . We would like this product shift to be ergodic,
in which case we say that P and T are jointly ergodic. However, a
pitfall here is that for this to be true, it is not enough that one or the
other, or even both, of the probe process and cross-trafﬁc process
be ergodic in their own right. To see the signiﬁcance of this, we
continue the ‘periodic-periodic’ example from Section 3.2.1.
Let the event A be those sample paths where, for all n, Tn −
Cn < 0.25, where Tn and Cn are respectively the arrival time of
the n-th probe and n-th cross-trafﬁc packet. For our phase locked
example, this translates to P(y−z < 0.25) = 0.25. However since
the offset between the two streams is ﬁxed at y − z for all n, A is
an invariant event, yet it has probability which is neither 0 nor 1.
Hence, the product shift is not ergodic, despite each of the streams
being individually ergodic. This example is the simplest one of its
kind, but is by no means the only one. Such periodic behaviors are
actually common in IP networks, for example when dealing with a
small number of persistent TCP ﬂows on an access link.
3.2.3 Palm Probability
As pointed out in Section 3.1, probing fundamentally involves
sampling. Whereas the underlying observable Z(t) is a process
in continuous time, in practice we must work with discrete obser-
vations taken at stochastic times. Palm Calculus [1] is a body of
results dealing with how the probabilistic laws governing a process
in fact depend on the ‘conditional viewpoint’ from which they are
‘observed’.
On our product space, the Palm probability P0 with respect to
the probe point process is deﬁned by
P0(Z(0) ∈ B) =
1
λ(b − a)
E
h X
Tn∈(a,b]
i
1Z(Tn )∈B
,
for any real numbers a ≤ b, where λ is the intensity of the probing
point process. Hence, the Palm probability is the average fraction
of probes in (a, b] which observe Z(t) as being in the set B. As B
is arbitrary, this is equivalent to knowing the entire distribution.
We now show that when probes are non-intrusive and indepen-
dent of cross-trafﬁc, then P0[Z(0) ∈ B] = P [Z(0) ∈ B], for all
B. Let N (a, b] denote the number of probes in (a, b]. From the
independence assumption and the fact that Z is a function of the
cross-trafﬁc point process only, we have

probes falling in the interval (a, b] given that there are exactly n

This result implies that the underlying law of the observable as
seen by independent probes (represented by P0) is equal to the
‘ground truth’ (represented by P ).
3.3 NIJEASTA and NIMASTA
In this section we give two theorems which build on the above to
establish broad conditions under which Equation (4) holds.
The signiﬁcance of the joint ergodicity property stems from the
pointwise ergodic theorem of Birkhoff. This theorem implies (see
Section 1.6 in Chapter 1 of [1]) that when the product shift is er-
godic, for all stationary stochastic processes Z(t) deﬁned on the
product space, and for all positive functions f, the following (al-
most sure) limit exists
lim
N→∞
1
N
f (Z(Tn)) = E0[f (Z(0))]
(6)
where E0 denotes the Palm probability of the probe point process.
We can now give our main result
THEOREM 1. If the product shift is ergodic and the probing
stream is independent of cross-trafﬁc, then Equation (4) holds.
Proof: Since the product shift is ergodic, it follows from Property
1.6.3 pp.52 in [1] that the discrete shift θT1 is ergodic w.r.t. the
Palm probability P 0, so that for all positive functions f the limit
lim
N→∞

N
f (Z(Tn)) = E[f (Z(0))]
(cid:10)(cid:11)
holds almost surely. The result then follows from (5).
This result can be summarised as:
NIJEASTA: Non-Intrusive Jointly Ergodic Arrivals See Time Av-
erages.
The jointly ergodic assumption of NIJEASTA is similar to the
Lack of Anticipation Assumption of Wolff in that it states exactly
what is required, but does not say when it is true, which can be
inconvenient in practice. Our next theorem is classical ([16], Theo-
rem 6.1, pp.65) and states simple sufﬁcient conditions under which
the joint ergodicity holds, based on the idea of mixing. A point
process P (or equivalently its shift) is said to be mixing4 if, for all
events A, B:
t→∞ PP (A ∩ θ−t(B)) = PP (A)PP (B).
lim
Intuitively, mixing is a special (and strong) form of ergodicity where
on separation under the shift, all memory between any sets A and
B is lost, so that they ultimately act as independent events.
THEOREM 2. The product space F of P and T is ergodic when-
ever at least one of them is a mixing process, and the other ergodic.
Of the two cases covered here, that of a mixing probe process has
practical importance, because although we may suspect that cross-
trafﬁc is mixing, especially in the Internet backbone where myriads
of random effects wash out deterministic synchronisation, we can-
not guarantee it. On the other hand, if we choose to use probing
processes which are mixing, we are assured of satisfying the joint
4In fact both weak and strong mixing can be deﬁned [16]

Palm Calculus can deal with this greater generality by consid-
ering clusters of (non-intrusive) probes sent at epochs {Tn} that
form a stationary and ergodic point process. Each cluster consists
of k + 1 probes sent at times Tn + ti, i = 0, . . . k with t0 = 0.
Palm calculus can then be applied by formulating the clusters as
marks, the probe process thereby becoming a marked point process
(for details see [1]). As before one can then measure without bias
the average behaviour of any such function, that is:
f (Z(Tn), . . . Z(Tn+tk)) = E[f (Z(0), . . . Z(tk))].

ergodicity conditions required for zero sampling bias, regardless
of the dynamics of cross-trafﬁc. To highlight this property, which
generalises PASTA (in the non-intrusive case!), we coin:
NIMASTA: Non-Intrusive Mixing Arrivals See Time Averages.
It is useful to review at this point the observations of Section 2.
Three kinds of processes appeared there: stationary renewal pro-
cesses (with exponential, uniform, or Pareto inter-arrivals), the pe-
riodic process (with random phase), and the EAR(1) process. As
is well known [3], renewal processes are mixing provided that the
support of the inter-arrival distribution contains an interval where
the density is larger than a positive constant, and the EAR(1) pro-
cess is also strongly mixing [5]. However, the periodic process is
not, although it is ergodic. The non-intrusive examples throughout
Section 2, in particular in Section 2.3, illustrate NIMASTA and NI-
JEASTA at work, depending on which trafﬁcs are mixing or not.
Finally, note that it is easy to construct a great variety of mixing
processes, for example using Markov processes with a particular
structure, as we will see in the next section.
Figure 7 illustrates NIMASTA for a more complex network: a
3 hop FIFO route with capacities of [6, 20, 10] Mbps. Each hop
carries 1-hop-persistent cross-trafﬁc which, for hop [1, 2, 3] respec-
tively, were chosen to be [ periodic, Pareto, TCP ] or [ TCP, Pareto,
TCP ], combinations which include potential for phase locking, long-
range dependence, and feedback (a single TCP ﬂow is used). For
space reasons we omit many details in this ‘proof of principle’ ex-
ample, which was generated using ns-2 [21], modiﬁed to allow the
ground truth Z(t) to be calculated accurately (see Section 7). Two
sets of results are given in the ﬁgure, depending on whether the
cross-trafﬁc on hop 1 is periodic, or window-constrained TCP. In
each case the delay marginals show that NIMASTA holds for each
of the mixing probe trafﬁcs, but not for the periodic probes, which
become phase locked. In the TCP case (right set of curves), the
period is commensurate with the round-trip time of the TCP ﬂow
on the ﬁrst hop, whereas in the other case (left curves), the periods
were chosen to be simple multiples.
3.4 From Delay to Jitter
So far we have considered positive functions f which act on Z at
a single time point only. In fact more general functions of the form
f (Z(0), Z(t1), . . . , Z(tk)) can be considered, which gives access
to the temporal structure of Z. Key examples are the n-dimensional
distributions of the process, and the delay variation or jitter.
For example, we show how to measure jitter on a time scale of
τ , that is, we desire the distribution of Jτ (t) = Z(t + τ ) − Z(t).
Let the clusters arrive as a renewal process with inter-arrivals dis-
tributed uniformly over [9τ, 10τ ]. This process is mixing. Each
cluster will consist of two points, the cluster seed at Tn, and a
trailing probe at Tn + τ . We then simply collect the jitter val-
ues {Jτ (Tn)} and estimate its distribution by forming a histogram
(technically, this implies deﬁning multiple functions f, each an in-
dicator function for a histogram bin, and counting the hits in each.
These counts are positive, although jitter itself takes either sign).
4.
INTRUSIVE MEASUREMENT
The last section dealt with the non-intrusive case. Here we con-
sider implications for inversion and sampling bias arising from ‘real’
probes of positive size. We then combine our ﬁndings to conclude
that Poisson probing should no longer be regarded as a viable de-
fault choice, and suggest an alternative.
The key new element is that now probes inﬂuence system evo-
lution. This does not affect the existence of the virtual delay pro-
cess W (t) (what a zero sized observer would see when arriving to
the system), nor our ﬁnal aim, namely to measure the ground truth
Z∗(t), the delay that would be observed by a positive sized probe
arriving to the unperturbed system at time t. However there are
several important changes:
(i) our observable Z(t) is no longer W (t), as the available data is
now what a real probe of positive size would experience;
(ii) observations of Z(t) are not observations of Z∗(t): an inver-
sion issue arises;
(iii) each of Z(t), Z∗(t) and W (t) now depends on the probe pro-
cess, in particular the probe size.
Our goal is to estimate Z∗(t) using observations of Z(t) at the
probing times Tn, and to determine in what sense, if at all, the
following modiﬁed form of Equation (4) holds:
f (Z(Tn)) = E[f (Z∗(0))].

Notice that this equation defaults to Equation (4) if probes are non-
intrusive, in which case Z(t) = Z∗(t) = W (t).
4.1 PASTA
We revisit PASTA with an emphasis on probing applications.
The general setting of Section 3.1 continues to hold, with the changes
as listed above.
In the intrusive case, sampling bias is typically present. For in-
stance, consider the ‘Uniform’ renewal process with support on
[0.9μ, 1.1μ] in the left hand plot in Figure 5. The negative bias
results from the probes only weakly seeing the contribution to load
of other probes, which arrive at least 0.9μ from them.
There is no reason for Equation (5) to hold in general. However,
the PASTA property of Wolff [22] states that, for Poisson probes, it

does, provided the Lack of Anticipation Assumption (LAA) holds.
However, we are not told which network scenarios satisfy LAA,
and therefore when PASTA will hold for real probing involves many
open questions. We therefore provide the following result and sketch
of proof, which states that PASTA does in fact hold for delay in the
traditional path model.
THEOREM 3. Under the above assumptions, for Poisson probes
(intrusive or not), in a FIFO tandem queueing network,
P0(Z(0) ∈ A) = P (Z(0) ∈ A).
(8)
In a FIFO tandem queueing network, Z(t) is

predictable w.r.t. the ﬁltration {Ft}, where Ft is the smallest σ-
ﬁeld that contains the past of the probe process before time t and
the (independent) σ-ﬁeld that contains the whole history of the CT
marked point processes (see [1], sections 1.8, 3.3).
Further, since a Poisson process is mixing, Theorem 2 is true and
so the product shift is ergodic. Using Equation (8) then allows the
same steps as in Section 3.3 to carry through, yielding

f (Z(Tn)) = E[f (Z(0))].

This statement of PASTA in our setting reafﬁrms the fact that what
it provides is unbiased sampling of (functions of) the total system
Z. This says nothing about Equation (7), which includes the inver-
sion step taking us back to our target, Z∗
.
Figure 8 illustrates PASTA using a 3-hop network with capacities
of [2, 20, 10] Mbps. Each hop carries 1-hop-persistent cross-trafﬁc
which is of type [periodic,Pareto,TCP], a combination which in-
cludes long-range dependence, and potential for phase-locking due
to either the TCP (again a single ﬂow) or periodic streams. Again
for space reasons we omit details. Delay marginals, obtained from
50000 probes, are plotted over a range of intrusiveness, achieved
with 4 different probe sizes. The results show, as we expect, that
