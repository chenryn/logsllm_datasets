Abstract. Inter-domain routing is a crucial part of the Internet
designed for arbitrary policies, economical models, and topologies. This
versatility translates into a substantially complex system that is hard
to comprehend. Monitoring the inter-domain routing infrastructure is
however essential for understanding the current state of the Internet and
improving it. In this paper we design a methodology to answer two sim-
ple questions: Which are the common transit networks used to reach a
certain AS? How much does this AS depend on these transit networks?
To answer these questions we digest AS paths advertised with the Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) into AS graphs and measure node centrality
(i.e. the likelihood of an AS to lie on paths between two other ASes).
Our proposal relies solely on the AS hegemony metric, a new way to
quantify node centrality while taking into account the bias towards the
partial view oﬀered by BGP. Our analysis using 14 years of BGP data
reﬁnes our knowledge on Internet ﬂattening but also exhibits the con-
solidated position of tier-1 networks in today’s IPv4 and IPv6 Internet.
We also study the connectivity to two content providers (Google and
Akamai) and investigate the AS dependency of networks hosting DNS
root servers. These case studies emphasize the beneﬁts of our method to
assist ISPs in planning and assessing infrastructure deployment.
1 Introduction
Networks connected to the Internet are inherently relying on other Autonomous
Systems (ASes) to transmit data. To determine the path of ASes to go from
one place to another, the Internet relies solely on the Border Gateway Protocol
(BGP). Computed AS paths are the result of an involved process that consid-
ers various peering policies set by each connected AS. BGP exposes only paths
that are favored by ASes hence concealing peering policies and the exact rout-
ing process. However, as the connectivity of a network depends greatly on the
connectivity of other ASes, operators need to clearly understand ASes that are

crucial to their networks. Identifying these AS interdependencies facilitates deci-
sions for deployments, routing decisions, and connectivity troubleshooting [17].
In this paper we aim at estimating the AS interdependencies from BGP
data. We devise a methodology that models AS interconnections as a graph and
measure AS centrality, that is the likelihood of an AS to lie on paths between
two other ASes. We identify in Sect. 2 shortcomings of a classical centrality
metric, Betweenness Centrality (BC), when used with BGP data. From these
observations we employ a robust metric to estimate AS centrality, called AS
hegemony (Sect. 3). We demonstrate the value of the proposed method with
14 years of BGP data (Sect. 4). Overall we found that AS interdependencies in
IPv4 are decreasing over time which corroborate with previous observations of
the Internet ﬂattening [3]. But we also found that the important role played
by tier-1 ISP is reinforced in today’s Internet. The Internet ﬂattening for IPv6
is happening at a faster rate, but we found that Hurricane Electric network is
utterly central for the last 9 years. We also investigated the AS dependency of two
popular networks, Akamai and Google, showing that their dependency to other
networks is minimal although their peering policies are completely diﬀerent.
Finally, we look at two networks hosting DNS root servers and show how recent
structural changes to these root servers have aﬀected their AS dependencies.
We make our tools and updated results publicly available [1] hence network
operators can quickly understand their networks’ AS dependency.
2 Background
Related Work: The essence of this work is the estimation of AS centrality in
AS graphs. In the literature AS centrality is commonly measured using Between-
ness Centrality (BC). This is one of the basic metric used to characterize the
topology of the Internet [12,18]. It was also applied for similar motivation as
ours. Karlin et al. [9] consider Internet routing at the country-level to investi-
gate the interdependencies of countries and identify countries relying on other
countries enforcing censorship or wiretapping. BC is also used to identify criti-
cal ASes for industrial and public sectors in Germany [17]. Similarly, Schuchard
et al. [15] select targets for control plane attacks using a ranking based on BC.
Finally, researchers have also applied BC to detect changes in the AS-topology.
For example, Liu et al. [11] employ BC to monitor rerouting events caused by
important disruptive events such as sea cable faults. Following past research,
we initially conducted our experiments using BC but faced fundamental short-
comings due to the incomplete view provided by BGP data. To introduce these
challenges let’s ﬁrst review BC.
Betweenness Centrality: BC is a fundamental metric that represents the
fraction of paths that goes through a node. Intuitively one expects high BC
scores for transit ASes as they occur on numerous AS paths, and low BC scores
for stub ASes. Formally, for a graph G = (V, E) composed of a set of nodes V and
u,w∈V σuw(v)
edges E, the betweenness centrality is deﬁned as: BC(v) = 1
S
where σuw(v) is the number of paths from u to w passing through v, and S is

the total number of paths. BC ranges in [0, 1], but the relative magnitudes of
the scores are usually more signiﬁcant than the absolute values.
Challenges: In theory, to compute BC one needs the set of all paths in the
graph. With BGP data, however, we are restricted to paths bounded to a small
number of viewpoints. We found that this singular type of path sampling greatly
impairs BC results. To illustrate this, Fig. 1a presents a simple example with 13
ASes and three viewpoints. If we had viewpoints in all ASes, thus access to all
paths in the graph, we would obtain the highest BC score for the transit ISP (.62)
and lowest scores for the stub ASes (.15). But, using only paths bound to the
three viewpoints, the computed BC scores are substantially diﬀerent (Sampled
BC in Fig. 1a). Because a third of the paths converge to each viewpoint, BC
values for ASes close to the viewpoints are undesirably high. This bias is so
pronounced that the BC for stub ASes accommodating viewpoints (.38) is twice
higher than the BC of one of the regional ISP (.16). Theoretical studies have
already reported the shortcomings of BC with sampled data [10], but this issue
has been rarely acknowledged in the networking literature. Mahadevan et al. [12]
reported that BC is not a measure of centrality when computed with network
data, but we stress that this issue comes from the non-random and opportunistic
sampling method used to collect BGP data rather than the metric itself.
In our experiments we construct a global AS graph using all data from the
Route Views, RIS, and BGPmon project on June 1st 2016. This corresponds
to an AS graph of more than 50k nodes with 326 viewpoints (we consider only
full-feed BGP peers), and only 0.6% of all the AS paths on the Internet (16 M
paths out of the 2.5B). As collected paths all converge to the 326 viewpoints,
ASes accommodating viewpoints and their neighboring ASes are seemingly more
central than other ASes. To measure the bias obtained with real BGP data we
conduct the following experiment. First, we compute the BC for all ASes with
data from all 326 viewpoints, then we compare this distribution of BC val-
ues to BC values obtained with a smaller set of randomly selected viewpoints.
The distance between two distributions is measured with the Kullback-Leibler

divergence. Figure 1b shows that changing the number of viewpoints invariably
reshapes the BC distribution, meaning that the obtained BC values are condi-
tioned by the number of viewpoints. From these results, we hypothesize that
having more viewpoints would yield diﬀerent BC values, thus the BC values
obtained with the 326 viewpoints might not be representative of AS centrality.
3 Methodology
To address the above BC shortcomings, we devise a monitoring method based on
a robust centrality metric called AS hegemony. The proposed method consists
of two basic steps. First we generate graphs from AS paths advertised via BGP.
Then, using AS hegemony, we estimate the centrality of each AS in the graphs.
We consider two types of graphs, global and local graphs.
Global graph: A global graph is made from all AS paths reported by the BGP
viewpoints regardless of the origin AS and announced preﬁx. Consequently, these
graphs represent the global Internet and central nodes stand for transit networks
that are commonly crossed to reach arbitrary IP addresses. In 2017, IPv4 global
graphs typically contains about 58 k nodes and 188 k edges (14 k nodes and 43 k
edges for IPv6). The structure of these graphs is complex, yet they are valuable
to monitor the Internet altogether and reveal Internet-wide routing changes.
Local graph: A local graph is made only from AS paths with the same ori-
gin AS. Thereby, we compute a local graph for each AS announcing IP space
globally. Each local graph represents the diﬀerent ways to reach its origin AS
and dominant nodes highlight the main transit networks towards only this AS.
These graphs are particularly useful to monitor the dependence of an AS to other
networks. In addition, structural changes in local graphs can expose important
routing changes that may be detrimental to the origin AS reachability.
AS Hegemony: The core of the proposed method is to quantify the centrality
of ASes in the generated graphs. To circumvent BC sampling problems we extend
the recently proposed AS hegemony metric [5]. This metric measures the fraction
of paths passing through a node while correcting for sampling bias.
Computing the hegemony of AS v from AS paths collected from several
viewpoints consists of the two following steps. First, AS paths from viewpoints
that are biased towards or against AS v are discarded. A viewpoint bias towards
AS v means that the viewpoint is located within AS v, or topologically very
close to it, and reports numerous AS paths passing through AS v. In contrast,
a viewpoint bias against AS v is topologically far from v and is reporting an
usually low number of AS paths containing v. Therefore, viewpoints with an
abnormally high, or low, number of paths passing through v are discarded and
only other viewpoints are selected to compute the hegemony score. Second, the
centrality of v is computed independently for each selected viewpoint and these
