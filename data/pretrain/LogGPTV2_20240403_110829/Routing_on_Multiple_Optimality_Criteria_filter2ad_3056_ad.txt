It is expected that the parametric method can per-
form much more efﬁciently than the labeling method
on the price of missing a small part of the nondomi-
nated solution set. Both the average computation times
consumed by the labeling method and the paramet-
ric method for each network scenario are plotted in
Figure 3. Here we present this comparison in two differ-
ent scales: a small scale for networks with the number of
arcs less than 3,500 and a large scale for the full range of
network sizes we use. It is clearly observed that, when
the network size is relatively small (i.e., the number of
arcs in the network is less than about 2,100), the label-
ing method runs faster than the parametric method (see

Figure 3a); however, with the network size increasing,
the computation time required by the labeling method
increases drastically while the parametric method in-
creases its computation time at a quite moderate speed
(see Figure 3b). For the largest network (i.e., the net-
work with 3,920 nodes and 12,480 arcs) in the set, for
example, the average computation time spent by the la-
beling method is about 173.4 seconds; in contrast, the
parametric method merely costs 17.7 seconds on aver-
age for the same network.
It is known that the computation cost of a labeling
method is primarily determined by the number of dom-
inance checks during the labeling process, while the
computation cost of the proposed parametric method
is a function of the number of actual nondominated
paths as well as the search process of two preliminary
destination-to-origin shortest paths. When the network
size is small, the number of potential nondominated
paths arriving at an intermediate node and hence the

number of dominance checks during the search pro-
cess is relatively small. Therefore, the dominance check
process of a multiobjective labeling method is not sig-
niﬁcantly more costly than that of its single-objective
counterpart in the same network. In contrast, the para-
metric method requires the nondominated paths gen-
erated one by one, each of which is a single-objective
shortest path problem, plus the requirement of search-
ing for two destination-to-origin paths. Therefore, its re-
quired computation cost is expected to be signiﬁcantly
higher than that of a single-objective path search in the
same network.
However, when the network size becomes large, the
number of potential dominance checks at any interme-
diate node increases in an exponential manner in its
worst case, so the resulting computation cost of the
labeling method. On the other hand, the computation
cost of the parametric method increases with the num-
ber of actual nondominated paths, which increases only
moderately in our case. Moreover, the cost for search-
ing two destination-to-origin shortest paths, though in-
creasing with the increasing network size in its absolute
value, shrinks to a relatively small part of the whole
computation cost. Apparently,
it is the polynomial-
time complexity feature of the parametric method that
makes it outperform the most efﬁcient labeling method
in terms of solution efﬁciency when the size of a biob-
jective routing problem tends to be large.
In addition to the average computational perfor-
mance, we also present the computational result of
each individual topology-attribute scenario in terms of
the combination of solution quality and efﬁciency (see
Figure 4). It can be seen that across all these topology-
attribute scenarios, the parametric method typically
requires much less computation time in ﬁnding a com-
parable number of nondominated solutions than the
labeling method, especially when the network size is
large. This comparison of the individual results fur-
ther conﬁrms the efﬁciency advantage of the paramet-
ric method in searching for nondominated solutions of
biobjective shortest path problems, in that it constructs
a better trade-off between the solution quality and efﬁ-
ciency.
For a complete presentation, we summarize in
Table 1 the problem sizes and the computation results
about the solution quality and efﬁciency of the two biob-
jective optimal path algorithms from the above numeri-
cal evaluation.
These numerical results provide us with an overall
understanding about the computational performance of
the proposed constrained parametric method for biob-
jective shortest path problems; however, its algorithmic
characteristics and solution behaviors and patterns may
not be fully revealed by only observing the two perfor-
mance measures. In fact, it is those algorithmic and so-
lution features that make the parametric method be a
more attractive tool in solving and analyzing multiob-
jective shortest path problems. We supplement below
an example application that is of relatively small size but
has realistic implications to highlight these features and
also illustrate the use of the decomposition scheme.
3.2 Example application
3.2.1 Problem description. The presented example
problem involves shipments of a ﬂammable liquid from
an origin in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a destination
in Portland, Maine, through the U.S. Interstate High-
way system in the northeastern states, which is created
based on the data set used in Nozick et al. (1997) and
Chang et al. (2005). This northeastern highway network
consists of 233 nodes and 630 arcs. Three conﬂicting ob-
jectives are deﬁned in this routing problem: (1) mini-
mization of the length of the route; (2) minimization of
the rate of accidents resulting in a release of hazardous
material; (3) minimization of the size of populations that
are potentially affected by a release of hazardous mate-
rial.
In addition to this original setting of three routing ob-
jectives, we also construct a biobjective routing case that
is formed with only the ﬁrst objective of route length
and a new objective named risk exposure. As we in-
troduced before, this latter performance measure may
be calculated on the arc level by multiplying the acci-
dent rate and the population size. This biobjective prob-
lem construction is needful and has its practical value:
ﬁrst, the focus of our discussion in this text is a biobjec-
tive shortest path problem; second, it is of interest to us
whether such a biobjective problem could approximate
the original triobjective problem well in a realistic prob-
lem setting.

tively. It is apparent that if a complete nondominated
solution set is required, the labeling method beats the
parametric method in both solution quality and efﬁ-
ciency. The advantage of the parametric method, how-
ever, lies in its gradual solution generation behavior.
For example, if the required number of nondominated
solutions is less than 20, the parametric method out-
performs the labeling method (see Figure 6). More im-
portantly, the parametric method has the priority of
generating those “most representative” solution points,
following the generation of the two initial extreme non-
dominated solutions that are exclusively optimized for
each of the two objectives.
This can be seen, for instance, by labeling the ﬁrst
six nondominated solutions generated by the paramet-
ric search process (see Figure 7). The six solutions
represent very different tradeoffs between the route
length minimization and the risk exposure minimiza-
tion, among which some solutions denote a dominating

To this end, we carry out the routing analysis in two
parts. First, we examine the performance of the con-
strained parametric algorithm in solving the biobjective
routing problem; then, we discuss an analysis of the de-
composition scheme applied to the triobjective routing
problem and assess the similarity in the routing result
between the biobjective problem and the triobjective
problem.

set generated by the labeling method in 0.168 seconds
contains 39 nondominated solutions. In contrast, the
