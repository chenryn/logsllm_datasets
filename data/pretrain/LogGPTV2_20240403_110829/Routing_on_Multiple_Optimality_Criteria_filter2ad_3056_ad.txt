### Parametric Method vs. Labeling Method: Efficiency and Solution Quality

It is anticipated that the parametric method will perform more efficiently than the labeling method, even at the cost of potentially missing a small part of the nondominated solution set. Figure 3 illustrates the average computation times for both methods across different network scenarios. The comparison is presented in two scales: a smaller scale for networks with fewer than 3,500 arcs and a larger scale for the full range of network sizes.

**Figure 3: Computation Cost Over Network Size**

- **(a) Small Network Sizes (up to 3,500 arcs):**
  - When the network size is relatively small (i.e., fewer than about 2,100 arcs), the labeling method outperforms the parametric method in terms of computation time.
  - As the network size increases, the labeling method's computation time rises sharply, while the parametric method's computation time increases at a more moderate rate.

- **(b) Full Range of Network Sizes:**
  - For the largest network in the set (3,920 nodes and 12,480 arcs), the labeling method requires an average computation time of approximately 173.4 seconds, whereas the parametric method takes only about 17.7 seconds on average.

### Computational Cost Analysis

The computational cost of the labeling method is primarily influenced by the number of dominance checks during the labeling process. In contrast, the parametric method's cost is a function of the number of actual nondominated paths and the search for two preliminary destination-to-origin shortest paths.

- **Small Networks:**
  - In smaller networks, the number of potential nondominated paths and dominance checks is relatively low, making the multiobjective labeling method not significantly more costly than its single-objective counterpart.
  - The parametric method, however, generates nondominated paths one by one, each as a single-objective shortest path problem, plus the additional cost of searching for two destination-to-origin paths, which can be higher.

- **Large Networks:**
  - In larger networks, the number of potential dominance checks at any intermediate node can increase exponentially, leading to a significant rise in the labeling method's computation time.
  - The parametric method's computation cost increases moderately with the number of actual nondominated paths, and the cost for searching two destination-to-origin shortest paths becomes a relatively small part of the total computation cost.
  - The polynomial-time complexity of the parametric method makes it more efficient than the most efficient labeling method when dealing with large biobjective routing problems.

### Solution Quality and Efficiency

In addition to the average computational performance, we also evaluate the individual topology-attribute scenarios in terms of the combination of solution quality and efficiency (see Figure 4). Across all these scenarios, the parametric method generally requires less computation time to find a comparable number of nondominated solutions, especially in large networks. This further confirms the parametric method's efficiency advantage in solving biobjective shortest path problems, as it provides a better trade-off between solution quality and efficiency.

### Example Application

#### 3.2.1 Problem Description

- **Example Problem:**
  - The example involves shipping flammable liquid from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Portland, Maine, through the U.S. Interstate Highway system in the northeastern states. The network consists of 233 nodes and 630 arcs.
  - Three conflicting objectives are defined:
    1. Minimization of the route length.
    2. Minimization of the accident rate resulting in hazardous material release.
    3. Minimization of the population size potentially affected by a hazardous material release.
  - Additionally, a biobjective routing case is constructed with the first objective (route length) and a new objective (risk exposure), calculated as the product of the accident rate and population size.

#### 3.2.2 Biobjective Routing Case

- **Solution Set:**
  - The complete solution set generated by the labeling method in 0.168 seconds contains 39 nondominated solutions.
  - The parametric method finds 30 nondominated solutions, but it outperforms the labeling method when the required number of solutions is less than 20 (see Figure 6).

**Figure 6: Nondominated Solution Generation Over Time**

- **Gradual Solution Generation:**
  - The parametric method has the advantage of generating "most representative" solution points, starting with the two initial extreme nondominated solutions optimized for each objective (see Figure 7).

**Figure 7: Representative Nondominated Solutions**

- **Trade-offs:**
  - The six solutions generated by the parametric method represent different trade-offs between route length minimization and risk exposure minimization, providing a diverse set of options.

### Conclusion

The numerical results provide a comprehensive understanding of the computational performance of the constrained parametric method for biobjective shortest path problems. While the labeling method may be more efficient for small networks, the parametric method's polynomial-time complexity and gradual solution generation make it a more attractive tool for large and complex problems.
