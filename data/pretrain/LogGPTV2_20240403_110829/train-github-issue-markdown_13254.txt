I am looking to add support for running applications on all devices directly from Visual Studio Code. Initially, I anticipated that while debugging with the `--start-paused` option might not be feasible, I would still be able to launch and utilize hot-reloading or restart capabilities. However, it appears this is not currently possible, as indicated by the following error:

```
--machine does not support -d all.
```

I am uncertain about the ease of implementing this feature (excluding the debugging functionality). It may require adding device IDs to some of the other events, in order for the IDE to effectively track multiple applications across different devices.
