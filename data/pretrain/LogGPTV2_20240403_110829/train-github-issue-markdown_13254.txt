I wanted to add support for running on all devices from VS Code. I was
expecting that I probably wouldn't be able to debug (`--start-paused`) but I
did think I'd be able to launch and hot-reload/restart. This seems to not be
the case, however:
    --machine does not support -d all.
I'm not sure whether it's easy to support this (without debugging).. probably
some of the other events may need device IDs adding to them (eg. so the IDE
can track multiple apps quitting).
