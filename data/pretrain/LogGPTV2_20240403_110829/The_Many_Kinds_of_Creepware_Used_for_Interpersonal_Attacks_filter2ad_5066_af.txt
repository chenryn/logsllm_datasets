A. Seed Set Apps
APPENDIX
Table VII shows the 18 covert surveillance apps that we used
as the seed set for running CreepRank on 2017 Norton app
installation data. These apps were identiﬁed by Chatterjee et
al. [5] as covert surveillance apps that are primarily distributed
outside of Android app stores such as Google Play.
B. Examples of PMI Analyses
In Section VII-A we provide examples of apps whose
primary use case was unclear during coding, and for which the
Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) metric gave us valuable
insights into the context in which these apps are most often

used in practice. Here we provide more details in Table VIII
which lists, for the ﬁve apps described in that section, the ten
apps with the highest corresponding PMI scores. To remove
noise from the PMI rankings, we exclude PMI values for apps
that co-occurred with with the target app only once.
C. Description of Codebook
This appendix describes the codes developed during analysis
of the top 1,000 apps produced by CreepRank on 2017 data.
All counts provided here are in reference to the CreepRank
2017 top 1,000 apps. Further coding of 2018/2019 data did
not require modiﬁcations to the codebook.
Caller ID - Misc: 6 apps provide caller ID functionality that
did not ﬁt into other sub-categories. These apps often enable
call blocking or claim to reveal private phone numbers.
Caller ID - Location: 40 apps bundle caller-id functionality
with location tracking of placed calls, usually claiming cell-
tower information as the source of location information (when
the source is speciﬁed at all). Many of these apps claim to be
able to use cell tower information to determine the location
of incoming calls. Co-occurrence data suggests these apps are
used by attackers and victims alike.
Control – Hide Icon: 9 apps hide the icons of other apps
from the home screen or app launcher screen (usually both),
rendering their presence sufﬁciently covert as to be unlikely
to be noticed and removed.
Control – Use Limitations: 4 apps enable the user to
interrupt the internet access of other devices on the WiFi
network, typically by staging ARP-spooﬁng network attacks.
The “NetCut” app is one of many such apps.
Defense – Misc: “Hidden Apps” is the sole miscellaneous
defense app among the 2017 top 1,000 apps. It is a hidden
app-icon revealer used to counter Control - Hide Icon apps.
Defense – Anti Harassment: We found 3 apps that appear
to be used to mitigate call and SMS bombing. These apps
are frequently co-installed with other bombing-defense apps,
such as apps with caller-id and caller blacklisting functionality.
Two of these apps facilitate muting the device’s system volume
and/or vibration alerts during set times or for a period of time,
while another app blacklists SMS senders.
Defense – Anti Surveillance: 38 apps counter surveillance
attempts through a variety of means, including access con-
trol for incoming phone calls and individual apps, counter-
surveillance, and shoulder-surﬁng defense. Speciﬁc examples
are provided in Section V-B.
Evasion – Alternative Input: 4 apps provide accessibility-
focused mechanisms for enabling user input, such as control
of a mouse-style pointer based on the tracking of face or
eye movement. These apps are routinely installed alongside
surveillance apps that monitor the device and enable it to be
controlled remotely.
Evasion – Hidden Content: Most apps in this category
selectively hide content including images, WhatsApp content,
contacts, and communications. We found 9 apps when coding
2017 data, and many more when seeding CreepRank with
Control - Hide Icon apps. Many of these apps either hide
their icons or pose as an unsuspecting app, as in the case of
the “Smart Hide Calculator”. We also found several messaging
platform apps designed speciﬁcally for secrecy, both through
heavy use of encryption and ephemeral messaging.
Evasion – Steganography: A few apps, such as “Pixel-
knot”, use steganography to hide messages in images such
that a human would not perceive them, suggesting a desire for
secrecy. However, most of the apps we found created messages
that can be interpreted by humans but not readily interpreted
by machines, such as emojifying apps and apps that convert
words to images or ASCII art. We were surprised to ﬁnd that
most of these were being used by attackers, possibly to avoid
censorship on social media platforms.
As discussed in Section VII-B, there are several apps that
we coded initially as steganography apps that actually seem to
be used to amplify the effect of SMS bombing attacks. These
apps create ASCII art or do image-to-text conversion, creating
huge strings that are sent over and over by bombing apps.
Harassment – Automation: 11 apps automate social media
activity, such as auto-reply, schedule-based message senders,
auto-commenting, and chatbots. These apps show varying
degrees of malicious intent, typically correlating most strongly
with social media surveillance apps, bombing apps, or mal-
ware. Most of these apps focus on WhatsApp.
Harassment – Bomber: 10 apps are designed to send high
volumes of texts, calls, emails, social media posts, etc., though
a few instead send messages that are so large as to cause a
serious nuisance or cost to the victim. These apps seem to
have a short shelf life on app stores, but new apps rise to take
their place. Recent apps of this ilk are more likely to refer to
themselves as “text repeaters” than as “bombers.”
Harassment – Fake Surveillance: The most prevalent
harassment apps are the 56 apps that scare victims by giving
them a false impression that they are being surveilled. Most
of these self-described “prank” apps can be installed on the
abuser’s device and shown brieﬂy to the victim while the app
simulates hacking of the victim’s device or accounts.
Information Extraction – Misc: 3 apps did not ﬁt into sub-

categories, including two with decryption functionality and
one that captures extended screenshots of content.
Information Extraction – Dump: 32 apps perform large-
scale dumps of a broad variety of content, which include
WhatsApp database decryptors and dumpers, extractors of
forensic information, call logs, social media contacts, location
history, deleted content, hidden or encrypted content, etc.
Information Extraction – Fraud: We found 6 apps with
use cases that pertain to fraud, such as credit card num-
ber revealers, details ﬁnders, validators, and generators. Two
examples are the “Bank Card Validator” and the “Credit
Card Revealer” app. Apps that generate fake ID card images
routinely appear alongside credit card revealing apps, which
strengthens the hypothesis that they the card revealers are used
for fraud. The “Lodefast Check Cashing App” enables the
cashing of checks without visiting a bank, and we re-classiﬁed
it under fraud when PMI values revealed that it is usually
installed alongside fraud apps in our dataset (see Table VIII).
Information Extraction – Hack Tools: 11 apps provide
hacking tools, three of which focus on extracting passwords,
while one looks passwords up in public data breach repos-
itories. The remainder enable snifﬁng of wireless network
trafﬁc or provide pen-testing and attack functionality. There
was a noticeable increase in the number of hacking apps
in 2018/2019 data, among which snifﬁng apps were very
prevalent.
Information Extraction – People Search: 12 apps look
up personal details pertaining to individuals. Searches may
be keyed off of phone number, names, email addresses, etc,
frequently providing extensive personal information. The most
unique app in this category is “BaeList”, which advertises as
a tool to catch cheaters by alerting its users if a suspected
cheater’s phone number has been searched for by another user.
Information Extraction – System: 7 apps extract Android
system details, such as IP address, IMEI, and SIM cards. The
purposes of such apps are usually left unspeciﬁed, but they
are useful for Control - Use Limitations apps and for network-
based surveillance tools.
None – Misc: 124 apps have no discernible utility for an
attacker or victim. Most of these apps ﬁt cleanly into sub-
categories described below. Of the 55 apps that do not ﬁt
into sub-categories, around half are false positives introduced
by Pay-Per-Install apps, AV-testing (some of these apps are
used extensively as benign examples), and cloned devices. In a
few cases, app titles suggest malicious functionality that is not
delivered, such as the deceptively named “Spy Mobile” app.
The remainder of these apps correlate strongly with malicious
creepware, and the presence of some apps, such as the “Blue
Whale Game,” is alarming, as it issues a series of self-harm
challenges and culminates in a suicide challenge.
None – Android and OS Mods: 21 apps modify or
extend Android, such as emulating the Chromium OS, adding
windowing support, etc. It is evident from the number of
hacking-related apps and tutorials in the data that the hacker
community makes ample use of creepware, and co-occurrence
data suggests such users are likely to root their devices and
experiment with OS modiﬁcation. Also contributing to the
presence of these apps are signiﬁcant numbers of AV-testing
and researcher devices, as discussed in Section VII-D.
