User: I am connecting to a server through PHP SSH and then using exec to run a python program on that server. 
If I connect to that server through putty and execute the same command through command line, I get result like:

Evaluating....
Connecting....
Retrieving data....
1) Statement 1
2) Statement 2
.
.
.
N) Statement N

Python program is written by somebody else...
When I connect through SSH php, I can execute $ssh->exec("ls") and get the full results as proper as on server command line. But when I try $ssh->exec("python myscript.py -s statement 0 0 0"); I couldn't  get the full results but I get a random line as an ouput.
In general, if somebody had experienced the same issue and solved, please let me know.
Thanks
Assistant: Perhaps it's caused by buffering of the output. Try adding the -u option to your Python command - this forces stdout, stdin and stderr to be unbuffered.
