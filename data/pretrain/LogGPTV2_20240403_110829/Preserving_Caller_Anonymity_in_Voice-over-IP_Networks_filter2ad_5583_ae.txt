### Comparison with Random Walk and Broadcast Protocols

The proposed algorithm outperforms the Ï‰ = 1 random walk, which achieves a top-10 probability of 0.05 with 10 malicious nodes. Additionally, random walk-based protocols show a significant improvement over the broadcast protocol, which has a top-10 probability of 0.85 with the same number of malicious nodes.

### C. Network Topology

In this section, we evaluate the sensitivity of timing analysis attacks to the network topology. Our results demonstrate that a triangulation-based timing analysis attack remains effective on a broadcast protocol even when the adversary has incomplete or incorrect knowledge of the network topology. We also examine the scalability of caller identification attacks on various route setup protocols.

#### Topology Discovery

Figure 22 illustrates the top-10 probability using different route setup protocols when only a fraction of the network topology is known to the adversary. If the adversary's view of the network topology is not connected, we use the first connected component that receives the route setup request for the attack. From Figures 14 and 22, we observe that in a broadcast-based route setup protocol, setting m = 20 and ttl = 2 improves the top-10 probability to 0.72. This indicates that even with partial knowledge of the network topology, the attacker can still successfully launch caller identification attacks on a broadcast-based route setup protocol. In contrast, the top-10 probabilities for controlled random walk and multi-agent random walk are significantly lower at 0.08 and 0.05, respectively. The random walk-based protocols are more sensitive to topology knowledge, making them more resilient to caller identification attacks. Specifically, the top-10 probability for the multi-agent random walk protocol is 42% lower than that with complete topology knowledge, while the numbers for the controlled random walk and the broadcast protocol are about 33% and 9%, respectively.

#### Network Churn

Figure 23 shows the efficacy of caller identification attacks as the network churn increases, with m = 10 malicious nodes. For example, a churn rate of 0.1 means that approximately 10% of the proxy nodes have joined and left the network since the last discovery phase. We observe that for the broadcast protocol, the attack efficacy drops by less than 15% when 5-10% of the topology has changed since the last crawl. In contrast, for the random walk-based protocols, the attack efficacy drops by 40% under the same conditions. Given that the average lifetime of a VoIP proxy is 10.5 hours [34], it can be shown that the average time required for 10% churn is one hour. This allows for a stealthy attack where the adversary does not frequently flood the network with topology discovery (ping) messages.

#### Network Size

Figure 24 depicts the number of malicious nodes required to achieve a top-10 probability of 0.1 as the VoIP network size increases (the x-axis is in log scale). Experiments on topologies larger than 1024 nodes were conducted using discrete event simulation, and the results from our discrete event simulator were within 5% of those from NS-2 for topologies up to 1024 nodes. We observe that the number of malicious nodes required for an attack grows very slowly with the size of the network for the broadcast-based route setup protocol. For instance, in a 10,000-node network, the attacker could achieve a top-10 probability of 0.1 with just 25 malicious nodes using the broadcast protocol, whereas it required 400 nodes for the controlled random walk protocol and 1,200 nodes for the multi-agent random walk protocol. This clearly demonstrates the ability of random walk-based protocols to limit the scalability of caller identification attacks.

### VI. Related Work

Several low-latency anonymizing networks have been studied in the literature [12], [17], [8]. Anonymizing networks protect the identity of the sender and receiver using the concept of a mix [10], [28]. Onion routing [17] and its second-generation Tor [12] aim to provide anonymous transport of TCP flows over the Internet. While Tor supports on-demand route setup, it is not QoS-sensitive. ISDN mixes [23] propose solutions to anonymize phone calls over traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Networks).

It is widely acknowledged that low-latency anonymizing networks are vulnerable to timing analysis attacks [30], especially from well-placed malicious attackers [35]. Several papers have addressed the problem of tracing encrypted traffic using timing analysis [33], [36], [38], [32], [9], [13], [31]. These approaches rely on inter-packet timing characteristics for tracing traffic. Our approach differs in that we do not rely on inter-packet timing characteristics during the data transfer phase and specifically target QoS-sensitive route setup protocols. Our timing analysis attack is more akin to RF localization techniques that break source location privacy in sensor networks [18], [20]. Phantom routing [20] also proposes the use of random-walk-based protocols to mitigate localization attacks in sensor networks.

Some authors have suggested that the VoIP network can be used as an anonymizing network [31]. However, setting up a circuit or route on a VoIP network differs from state-of-the-art anonymizing networks in several ways. First, a random route on an anonymizing network may not meet latency-based QoS requirements, so VoIP uses route setup protocols that identify the shortest route from a caller to a receiver. Second, routes (or circuits) in a VoIP network are not constructed a priori. VoIP supports client mobility by allowing a client to connect to any node in the proxy network, thus requiring an on-demand QoS-sensitive route setup protocol.

Tarzan [16] presents an anonymizing network layer using the peer-to-peer model, employing a gossip-based approach to disseminate the identity of nodes on the peer-to-peer network. At the end of the gossip protocol, the caller supposedly knows the network topology and the receiver, obviating the need for a route setup protocol. This approach requires the caller and receiver to be connected to the network for a sufficient amount of time before they can discover each other and make VoIP calls. However, most VoIP applications use on-demand route setup to support client mobility.

Traditionally, multicast and broadcast protocols have been used to protect receiver anonymity [24]. This approach sends a unicast message to a single destination by multicasting the message to a group containing the destination. The intended destination recognizes the message because it expects it (Hordes [27]) or because the sender addresses the message implicitly [24]. In contrast, our paper focuses on caller (source) anonymity rather than receiver anonymity. Perng et al. [22] have shown that multicasting data on an anonymizing network can break some privacy guarantees, particularly by allowing malicious nodes to infer information about the data based on the popularity of a multicast packet.

### VII. Conclusion

In this paper, we address the problem of on-demand construction of QoS-sensitive routes on anonymizing networks, using VoIP as a sample application. We demonstrate potential attacks on QoS-sensitive route setup protocols and propose solutions to mitigate them. First, we identify triangulation-based timing attacks on broadcast-based route setup protocols that can identify the caller with high probability. Second, we develop random walk-based protocols to mitigate these attacks while balancing QoS guarantees with anonymity. We describe a prototype implementation of our guards and present a detailed experimental evaluation that demonstrates their QoS properties and attack resilience. Our results show that while the broadcast-based route setup protocol is vulnerable to timing analysis attacks, the random walk-based protocols offer good attack resilience while satisfying QoS guarantees. In summary, our solutions effectively protect caller anonymity in a VoIP network.
