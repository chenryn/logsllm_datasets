titleblackhat:eu-18 Where 2 Worlds Collide: Bringing Mimikatz et al to UNIX
Over the past fifteen years there's been an uptick in "interesting" UNIX infrastructures being integrated into customers' existing AD forests. Whilst the threat models enabled by this should be quite familiar to anyone securing a heterogeneous Windows network, they may not be as well understood by a typical UNIX admin who does not have a strong background in Windows and AD. Over the last few months I've spent some time looking a number of specific AD integration solutions (both open and closed source) for UNIX systems and documenting some of the tools, tactics and procedures that enable attacks on the forest to be staged from UNIX.
