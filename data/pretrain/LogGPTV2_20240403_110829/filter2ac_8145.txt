### Title: Where Two Worlds Collide: Bringing Mimikatz and Other Tools to UNIX

Over the past fifteen years, there has been a notable increase in the integration of "interesting" UNIX infrastructures into existing Active Directory (AD) forests. While the threat models associated with this integration should be familiar to those securing heterogeneous Windows networks, they may not be as well understood by typical UNIX administrators who lack a strong background in Windows and AD.

In recent months, I have examined several specific AD integration solutions—both open-source and proprietary—for UNIX systems. My goal was to document the tools, tactics, and procedures that enable attacks on the AD forest to be staged from UNIX environments. This research aims to bridge the knowledge gap and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the security implications for both Windows and UNIX administrators.
