Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides infrastructure such as virtual computers, storage, and networks, and users can freely configure and manage these resources. Common IaaS services include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, etc. 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides an application development and deployment platform on which users can develop and deploy applications without caring about the underlying infrastructure. Common PaaS services include Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, etc. 3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Directly provide software application services without requiring users to deploy and manage the underlying infrastructure. Common SaaS services include Office 365, Salesforce, etc. When choosing cloud computing services, you need to choose different cloud computing services according to business needs: 1. If the business needs to control more configuration and management of the underlying infrastructure, you can choose IaaS services; 2. If the business needs to quickly develop and deploy applications Program, you can choose PaaS service; 3. If the business needs to directly use software application services, you can choose SaaS service. In addition, factors such as load capacity, data security, and data backup and recovery need to be considered to select an appropriate cloud computing service provider to meet business needs.
