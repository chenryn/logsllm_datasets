### Describe your issue.
Scipy requires numpy.
But both include (at least in their Windows wheels) a form of libopenblas.
So when you want to redistribute an app that is using scipy you are forced to
redistribute 2 copies of libopenblas (each 35 MB) that both get loaded into
memory.
A simple solution would be to publish libopenblas as an own library on Pypi
(and make scipy and numpy depending on it).  
An alternative solution would be for scipy to use the numpy installed
libopenblas.
### Reproducing Code Example
