User: This should be a really simple question, but I'm a little new to all this. I am trying to update my version of Python on Mac OS X 10.6.8. So, I downloaded Python 3.3 from www.python.org, and ran the .dmg file. This then created a "Python 3.3" icon in my Applications folder. However, when I type "python -V" into the Terminal, it prints "Python 2.7.6", so clearly my version of Python has not been updated. What am I doing wrong?
Thanks!
Assistant: You don't want to actually update the system version of python.
But also, python3 is the executable name.
