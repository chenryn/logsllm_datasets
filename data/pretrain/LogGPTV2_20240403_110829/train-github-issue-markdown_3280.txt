I'm having some difficulties to do a custom rendering for expanded choices.
I'm using an entity type wich is ordering entities by a relation table, and
for each different relation I have to do a group of chexkboxes, with another
one at the top allowing to select all or none of the group.
My issue is that I can't do the correlation between the form views and choice
views. So I think it's really complicated to do custom rendering on expanded
choices.
I'm suggesting to pass the ChoiceView as a var for each choice subForm so that
when iterating on the choice formview we can get access to the choice view
data, giving more information to be able to render custom stuffs (when the
original data is an object).
