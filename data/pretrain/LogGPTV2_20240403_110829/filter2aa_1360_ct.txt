rd~..s are present within the "Username/Email" tool within the custom Linux OSINT VM 
r---------created, as well as the Mac and Windows builds created in Chapter Six. Any time I encounter a Google
email address, Google document, YouTube Channel, or GAIA, 1 launch this tool. Figure 27.03 displays the 
custom tool menu for Linux (left), Mac (middle), and Windows (right).

If we are inside the Spiderfoot directory (~/Downloads/Programs/spidcrfoot), we can launch the Spiderfoot 
service with the following command.
• 
cd -/Downloads/Programs
• 
git clone https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot.git
• 
cd spiderfoot
• 
sudo -H python3 -m pip install
The ’’Graph" button displayed a detailed chart of connections from my domain to external sources. Figure 27.04 
displays my result, identifying associations to a Reddit username, Gravatar profile, and email server. Figure 27.05 
displays a Spiderfoot summary of my own domain.
1 cannot overstate that I am only presenting a handful of interesting nuggets. This application scours a domain, 
IP address, or email address for hundreds of data points which may provide value. Clicking the "Scans" button 
provides options to stop, re-run, or delete a scan result. It also provides a status summary’ of each current scan, 
and you can execute numerous scans simultaneously.
I chose "AU" in order to test the features, but this can be intrusive toward your target site. Choose the level of 
access appropriate for your investigation. The scan will launch and may take a while to complete, possibly hours. 
The amount of data acquired will be substantial, and I will only focus on a few areas of interest. The default 
screen displays the current progress and a log file. The "Browse" button in the upper left allows you to start 
peering into the data found about your target. Below are the sections of interest to my own site and the results 
displayed.
This program introduces more valuable utilities than any other single resource within this book. This wiU take 
some effort to install and configure, but the benefits justify the work. I installed the application into the custom 
Linux VM with the following steps.
• 
Account on external site (Four online profiles connected to my brand)
• 
Human Name (Identification of my full name and three associates)
• 
Leak site content (56 Pastebin files referencing my domain)
• 
Similar domain (Two domains with similar spelling, attempting to hijack traffic)
• 
Web technology’ (Pages on my’ site which rely on PHP, and my version)
If executing manually, you would need to launch Firefox and connect to http://l27.0.0.1:5001. We can 
replicate this from Terminal with the following.
I have already’ prepared a script titled "SpiderfooLsh" which can be launched from your Dock or Applications 
menu within your custom OSINT VM. Let's take a look at the interface and conduct an example query’. After 
launching the Spiderfoot program within Firefox, click the "New Scan" option. Provide a name for your session 
(IntelTechniques) and a domain (inteltechniques.com). Choose your desired "Use case" and click "Run scan".

This should install Recon-ng, and typing . /recon-ng from within this director}' launches the application. This 
screen will display the current version, and I am writing this based on version 5.1.1. You can also launch the "R" 
icon in your Dock which eliminates the need to navigate to ~/Downloads/Programs/recon-ng ever}’ time you 
want to use the application. The following command would be used to update your version of Recon-ng, which 
is already included in the "updates.sh" script previously mentioned.
Recon-ng does not possess many online tutorials. The guides that I have found are mostly an index of commands 
with little explanation. Instead of trying to summarize how the program functions, I will walk you through actual 
usage and explain as we go. I will start with the basics and then conduct numerous actual searches. In lieu of 
screen captures, I will include all text input and output in 9 pt Terminal font. Upon executing Recon-ng, you 
will be notified that no modules are installed. This is normal, and we will add them as we need them. At this 
prompt, let's begin with the help command. Typing help reveals the following commands and explanations.
Typing marketplace search will reveal the current functions available. Think of the marketplace similar to a list 
of utilities within Recon-ng, and each option as a "resource". Just like Bing is a website resource that we can use 
through a web browser, "bing^domain_web" is a specific resource that we can use in Recon-ng. The following 
modules were available at the time of this writing. We will use some of these during the instruction.
Recon-ng is a full-featured web reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent 
modules, database interaction, built-in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, 
Rccon-ng provides a powerful environment in which OSINT research can be conducted quickly and thoroughly. 
This utility provides automation to many of the redundant tasks that OSINT examiners find themselves 
performing on a daily basis. I offer a warning before proceeding. This is a technically complicated portion of 
this book. Please don't let that scare you off, we will approach each step slowly. First, we need to install Recon- 
ng into our OSINT Original virtual machine. Type the following into Terminal.

At any time, you can type marketplace info into Recon-ng to receive details about a specific item. As an 
example, typing marketplace info virustotal displays the following description.
