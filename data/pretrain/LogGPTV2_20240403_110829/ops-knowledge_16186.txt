User: When developing a Tornado application, I frequently want to restart the server to pick up new changes. I hit ctrl-c to stop the server, but with Tornado, this seems to be very slow. It waits for many seconds before shutting down, or doesn't shut down at all when issued a ctrl-c.
What's weird, is if, after clicking ctrl-c, I make a new request to the server (by, for example, refreshing my browser that is pointing at the server), it shuts down right away.
Anyone know how to explain this or fix it? Anyone experienced something similar?
(Note, this is on Windows.)
Assistant: I don't know why it takes so long to exit with Ctrl+C, but it worked for me in some cases to press Ctrl+\ (Linux terminal)
