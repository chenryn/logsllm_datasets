 **Describe the feature** :  
Currently `epoch_millis` has what appears to be an arbitrary 13 character
upper limit on what can be parsed. The date format documentation indicates
that the year range is between 1653 and 2286, and that you should use a
different formatter if your values exceed that range.
Because `epoch_seconds` is a subset of the `epoch_millis` format, it too has a
strange upper limit of 10 characters.
We commonly receive (incorrect) data with epoch millisecond values with more
than 13 characters.
For `epoch_millis`, one might assume this low number of digits is an attempt
to prevent 32 signed int overflow, but that doesn't compute.
Max signed 32 bit int is 2147483647, which is 10 digits.
The underlying library used by Elasticsearch for Date parsing is Joda Time,
and uses `DateTime(millis, DateTimeZone.UTC)` to construct an immutable
DateTime value from `epoch_millis` , where `millis` is a Java Long value.
`millis` can certainly accept more than 13 chars of digits.

I've asked this question in the discussion forums as well.
I have a PR ready to submit, pending the outcome of this discussion.
