**Feature Description:**

Currently, the `epoch_millis` format has an arbitrary 13-character upper limit for parsing. According to the date format documentation, the supported year range is between 1653 and 2286. If values fall outside this range, a different formatter should be used.

Since `epoch_seconds` is a subset of the `epoch_millis` format, it also has an unusual upper limit of 10 characters. We frequently encounter (incorrect) data with epoch millisecond values that exceed 13 characters.

One might assume that the 13-character limit for `epoch_millis` is intended to prevent 32-bit signed integer overflow. However, this does not hold up, as the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647, which is only 10 digits long.

Elasticsearch uses the Joda Time library for date parsing, which constructs an immutable `DateTime` value from `epoch_millis` using `DateTime(millis, DateTimeZone.UTC)`. Here, `millis` is a Java `Long` value, which can indeed handle more than 13 characters.

I have also posted this question in the discussion forums. I have a pull request (PR) ready to submit, pending the outcome of this discussion.
