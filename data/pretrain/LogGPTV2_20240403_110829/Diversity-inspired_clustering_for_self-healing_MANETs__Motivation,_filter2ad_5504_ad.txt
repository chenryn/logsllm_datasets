ment of more than 90% over the baseline protocol (i.e.,
hm(v)). Nonetheless, neither of the protocols is able to
P bl
achieve practically meaningful coverage. The reason is that
with such a small r, many scattered nodes would be out of
the transmission range of any other nodes, meaning that any
clustering mechanisms would not be able to organize them.
However, when r increases, which means that node v is
likely to have more neighbors, SCP begins to perform in a
satisfactory manner. Its coverage exceeds 90% at r = 40,
while the baseline protocol has coverage lower than 70%.
Nonetheless, both protocols have a slightly decreased cov-
erage beyond that point. The reason is that while a larger
transmission range r makes a cluster accommodate more
nodes, the number of competitors of v in its neighborhood
also increases. That means it would be more difﬁcult for
the ID of v to be ranked as the maximum or minimum. As
a result, the likelihood that v will become a CH slightly
decreases. Nonetheless, the value of coverage stays fairly
stable for larger values of r. By examining the constituent
measures, namely P scp
m (v), we see that the val-
ues of the former and latter slowly decrease and increase, re-
spectively, when r continues to increase, implying that the
value of P scp
hm (v) enters into an approximately equilibrium
state.
In Figure 4(b), the results displayed are based on a sce-
nario in which we assume that the 500×500 ﬁeld accommo-
dates 400 nodes. We note that for such a dense node popu-
lation, both SCP and the baseline protocol reach their peak
performance earlier, i.e., at r = 30. Beyond that, SCP’s
coverage remains reasonably high and stable throughout the
transmission range we consider.
h (v) and P scp
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) demonstrate the dual-policy-
induced clusterhead redundancy and node coverage redun-
dancy, respectively. While the redundancies are a by-
product of superimposed clustering, they result in robust-
ness advantages over the single-policy-based approaches.
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) display the values of P scp
r|ch(v) and
P scp
r|cm(v), respectively.
We see in both ﬁgures that the likelihoods of redundancy
are low when r is below 20, especially in the cases where
the node population density is low. Meanwhile, we observe
that both the probability of the presence of a redundant CH
and the probability of redundant coverage are increasing

functions of transmission range. The reason is that a larger
cluster will accommodate more nodes, which in turn, will
increase the likelihood of redundancies. Those are indeed
desirable results, since the loss of coverage for a larger node
population would have a more severe consequence, com-
pared with the case in which a small cluster containing a few
nodes is damaged. Nonetheless, the probabilities of CH re-
dundancy and coverage redundancy fairly quickly reach an
approximately equilibrium state, suggesting that a further
increase of r will result in very limited beneﬁts.
Table 2 shows the results we obtain from the SAN model
illustrated in Figure 3. For the evaluation, we assume that
the time between the moves of the passive CH is exponen-
tially distributed with a rate of 0.1 (per second). When the
timed activity “mv p” is activated, the passive CH will make
a move in either the positive or negative direction along the
X and/or Y axis within a cluster that has a radius of 30 me-
ters (i.e., the transmission range r). The threshold for acti-
vating/deactivating statistical preferences is kept as a vari-
able that varies from 4 to 20 meters. Speciﬁcally, when
D exceeds threshold h, we let the passive CH v have 70%

5 Related Work
In recent years, many research efforts have been devoted
to clustering protocols. Clustering protocols can be clas-
siﬁed into two major categories, according to their cluster-
ing policies. In the ﬁrst category, protocols apply clustering
policies that explicitly address speciﬁc requirements. Ex-
amples are mobility-aware clustering, energy-efﬁcient clus-
tering, and combined-metrics-based clustering. The effec-
tiveness of those protocols are dependent on the accuracy
of the parameters, the validity of the assumptions, and the
available amount of system proﬁle data (for calculating the
weighting factors for combined-metrics protocols). For ex-
ample, with the mobility-aware clustering protocol MOBIC
[13], mobile hosts with low speed relative to their neighbors
become clusterhead candidates, such that hosts with similar
speeds can be grouped into the same cluster to reduce the
needs for cluster maintenance. Hence, the performance of
MOBIC is highly dependent on the assumption of group
mobility.
Protocols of the second category apply clustering poli-
cies that address requirements in an implicit fashion. For
example, with passive clustering (PC) [14], cluster forma-
tion and maintenance are invoked only when mobile hosts
have data to disseminate. Thus PC does not need dedicated
control packets; rather, it lets control messages piggyback
on the upper-layer trafﬁc. As a result, PC allows the cluster-
ing overhead and maintenance costs to be low for MANETs
with high mobility. A drawback of PC is that the readiness
of a cluster-based routing structure will be a problem when
a MANET exhibits bursty trafﬁc.
The notion of dual-homing, widely used in the Internet,
has been adapted to improve survivability of wireless sensor
networks (WSNs). In [15], dual-homing is realized based
on the composition of two paths consisting of both dis-
jointed and jointed links, fostering partially protected mul-
ticast to ensure scalability. While SCP has a similar philos-
ophy, it complements the notion of partial protection by en-
abling self-healing of cluster-based MANETs through per-
mitting graceful performance degradation.
Several dominant pruning algorithms have been devel-
oped to reduce broadcast redundancy in ad hoc wireless

and 30% chances to move toward and away from the cluster
center, respectively.
Each entry in Table 2 is thus the probability that the dis-
tance between the passive CH and cluster center will at most
be d and the (translated) probability that the gracefully de-
graded clustering coverage G provided by the passive CH
will at least be g.
The results reveal an interesting tradeoff between h and
G. Furthermore, as shown in the table, even with a very re-
laxed threshold, i.e., h = 20, the probability that the passive
CH will cover nearly 60% (or above) of the cluster area will

For example, Lou and Wu [16] developed ap-
proximation algorithms to efﬁciently reduce the size of the
dominating set. While the purpose of the dominant prun-
ing algorithms was to decrease the number of nodes on data
forwarding paths, the objective of redundancy shadowing
in SCP is to extract and combine the complementary por-
tions of two cluster layers and to preserve the redundancies
for the future needs of self-healing. Finally, it is notewor-
thy that our superimposed clustering framework is ﬂexible
enough to permit clustering policies to address speciﬁc re-
quirements explicitly or implicitly.
6 Concluding Remarks
We have developed a framework of superimposed clus-
tering and investigated an instance of SCP. This effort is
meaningful for several reasons. First, since self-healing
is typically realized through autonomous reconﬁguration,
superimposed clustering provides a low-cost approach for
self-healing of large-scale systems that allows performance
to be gracefully degradable.
Second, we have exploited the notion of diversity in a
novel fashion. Rather than aim to reach a convergence or
majority agreement for the computation results from diver-
siﬁed computing resources, our intent is to let diversiﬁed
clustering policies create two cluster layers that will com-
pensate for each other after redundancy shadowing. More-
over, the shadowed redundancies let a cluster-based system
be prepared for self-healing.
While design diversity is often expensive in terms of de-
velopment, maintenance, and performance costs, the com-
bined use of diversiﬁed policies that are judiciously cho-
sen will be affordable. With the MaxMin-ID-based SCP
instance described in this paper, the parallel application of
two clustering policies will require exactly the same neigh-
borhood information that those policies would require when
used alone. This implies that the parallel use of cluster-
ing policies and the related computation (i.e., redundancy
shadowing) require no additional message exchanges be-
tween hosts in general. Further, since (relative to compu-
tation) message transmission is the major drive of perfor-
mance overhead and energy consumption in MANETs, SCP
can be justiﬁed with respect to its affordability as well as its
efﬁciency.
