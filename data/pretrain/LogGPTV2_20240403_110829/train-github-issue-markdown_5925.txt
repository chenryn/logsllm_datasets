 **Describe the bug**  
When upgrading from 0.19.0 to 0.19.1, our test suite breaks because `nock`
receives the cors OPTIONS call, which it did not receive before and did not
expect. This is a breaking change, and I wouldn't expect the OPTIONS call to
be made during tests.
Here's the error stack :
    Error: Error: Nock: No match for request {
            "method": "OPTIONS",
            "url": "http://some_url.org/",
            "headers": {
              "origin": "http://localhost",
              "access-control-request-method": "PUT",
              "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (darwin) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) jsdom/11.12.0",
              "host": "some_url.org",
              "content-length": 0
            }
          }

**Expected behavior**  
Mostly, a patch version should not break anything and breaking changes should
be documented.
**Environment:**
  * Axios Version 0.19.1
  * OS: OSX 10.15.3 (19D76)
  * nock: 11.7.0
