Table 1: Comparison of hierarchy-free reachability for the top 20
networks, from September 2015 and September 2020. We apply the
same methodology to calculate hierarchy-free reachability for each
dataset (§§ 4.1 and 6.1). We can see that Google was one of the
most independent networks, even in 2015. The other three cloud
providers have dramatically increased their ability to bypass Tier-1
and Tier-2 ISPs over the past five years.

reachability by combining the prior traceroute data and the CAIDA
dataset from September 2015 which contains 51,801 ASes. The 2015
dataset did not include traceroutes for Microsoft. Also, the dataset
applied its own IP to AS mapping, which likely has a non-trivial
percentage of false positives based on our validation efforts with the
cloud providers (§5). This likely causes us to overestimate the cloud
providers’ 2015 reachability, but it provides us a rough estimate for
comparing the changes over time.
Comparing the percentage of reachable ASes for each of the top
networks (Table 1), most have gained 5-6% in reachability, showing
that independence from the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs is increasing.
One notable change is that in 2015, only Google (#2) and IBM (#9)
appear in the top 20. We can see that over the past five years, Ama-
zon and Microsoft have significantly increased their independence
from the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. We analyzed and compared the
differences in path length from these two datasets, which is in Ap-
pendix E. Even though the cloud providers increased reachability,
it has had little impact on the distributions of their path lengths, as
their rate of adding new peers has trailed the Internet’s expansion.
6.6 Hierarchy-free Reachability versus
Customer Cone
There are various metrics for examining properties of the Internet
and its networks. One is customer cone, which for “AS X is the
set of ASes that X can reach using only p2c links... an indication
of the market power of an AS” [53]. Even though customer cone
is effective at measuring the number of ASes that the Tier-1 ISPs
and other large networks provide transit for, it fails to capture
the increased interconnectivity amongst networks and the shifting

for all ASes. Both metrics are a count of the total number of qualifying ASes; note the x-axis is in log scale. There are considerably more ASes
with hierarchy-free reachability comparable to that of the large provider networks, confirming the scale of flattening’s impact on reachability.
traffic patterns across those interconnections. As a result, it is not
representative of a network’s importance in a flattened Internet.
To examine whether customer cone still reflects the importance
of various networks, we calculate hierarchy-free reachability for
every AS on the Internet, which we compare against their customer
cone. This can be seen in Fig. 3, with hierarchy-free reachability on
the y-axis and customer cone for each AS on the x-axis, in log scale.
The figure depicts the four cloud providers (blue circles), Tier-1
ISPs (red square), Tier-2 ISPs (green diamonds), content providers
(small orange circles), provider networks (purple diamonds), access
networks (gray circles), and all other networks (brown X).
Other than the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, which have both high
hierarchy-free reachability and large customer cones, there is lit-
tle correlation between the two metrics. Although customer cone
captures aspects of the influence and market power of an AS, it
is not designed for and is not capable of capturing Internet flat-
tening’s effect on a network. For example, Sprint (AS 1239) is #32
for customer cone and is considered a Tier-1 ISP. However, their
hierarchy-free reachability rank is 2,978. Without the other Tier-
1 ISPs, Sprint relies heavily on a handful of Tier-2 ISPs to reach
many destinations. For additional details regarding examples of low
hierarchy-free reachability for Tier-1 ISPs, please see Appendix B.
There are relatively few networks that possess a large customer
cone; there are 8,374 networks with hierarchy-free reachability
≥ 1, 000, but only 51 networks with a customer cone ≥ 1, 000. One
reason for so few networks with a large customer cone is that there
is little incentive for a network to incur the costs of purchasing
transit from multiple providers beyond a primary and secondary
provider. Another reason is that establishing direct connectivity
to cloud and content providers is free1 and is supposed to provide
improved performance [7, 8, 26], so the majority of traffic no longer
flows through transit providers [71, 87, 115, 118].
Hierarchy-free reachability shows that a considerable number
of networks have high reachability when bypassing the Tier-1 and
Tier-2 ISPs, which suggests that customer cone–dominated by the
1Connectivity is free in terms of data transferred. Purchasing ports and space in an
IXP or colo do incur charges.

providers and top eight transit providers when bypassing the Tier-1
and Tier-2 ISPs. The unreachable networks per provider are sep-
arated into four types (§4.3). The numbers in each bar is the per-

large tier 1 and 2 networks–does not paint a complete picture of in-
fluence.. Customer cone is a top-down transit provider-centric view,
while hierarchy-free reachability provides a method to gauge di-
rectness of connectivity to edge networks. Customer cone captures
which ASes an AS can reach following only p2c links. Hierarchy-
free reachability also considers which ASes an AS can reach via its
peers, since a goal of peering connectivity is to bypass the hierarchy
and bring together lower tier networks to exchange traffic.
6.7 Unreachable Networks
We have seen that the cloud providers have a high degree of inde-
pendence from the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. Here we examine what
types of networks the cloud providers, Tier-1 ISPs, and Tier-2 ISPs
are unable to reach when bypassing the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. Net-
work types are classified into four categories (§4.3) as seen in Fig. 4:
content, access, transit, and enterprise.
Examining which types of networks each provider is unable to
reach when bypassing the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs can reveal their
peering strategies. Google, IBM, and Microsoft focus their peer-
ing efforts on reaching user (access) networks. Hurricane Electric,
which has an open peering policy while most large transit providers’
peering policies are restrictive, more closely resembles Google, IBM,

and Microsoft’s percentages than other Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. Ama-
zon’s percentages more closely resemble those of the other transit
providers, with fewer unreachable networks in the enterprise and
transit categories compared to the other three cloud providers.
7 HOW CLOUDS REACH OTHER NETWORKS
After examining the extent of the cloud providers’ reachability, we
also want to analyze the degree to which the cloud providers rely
on other ASes to reach the rest of the Internet and whether the
cloud providers’ efforts to bypass the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs has
shifted their reliance onto other networks.
7.1 Calculating Reachability Reliance
To calculate reliance we use all simulated paths tied for best accord-
ing to the Gao-Rexford model, without breaking ties. We define the
reliance rely(𝑜, 𝑎) of any origin, 𝑜, on any other individual AS, 𝑎,
as the fraction of best paths received in which 𝑎 appears for every
individual network 𝑡 to 𝑜. For example, consider the topology in
Fig. 5 where an individual network, 𝑡, receives three best paths
to reach 𝑜, with one AS, 𝑥, appearing in two best paths. In this
example, 𝑜’s reliance on 𝑥 is 2/3 AS and rely(𝑜, 𝑡) = 1.
In assessing reliance, there are two extreme conditions. The first
is a purely hierarchical Internet topology with no peering links
between networks except for those between the Tier-1 ISPs. In
such a topology, every network relies on its transit provider(s)
for the full Internet, and each of the Tier-1 ISPs for a portion of
the Internet depending on which Tier-1 ISP the AS (or its transit
provider) connects to. For example, if we considered Google in the
fully hierarchical network, and consider only one of its providers,
Tata (AS 6453) [15], its reliance on that transit provider would be
69,488, and Google’s reliance on the set of other Tier-1 ISPs would
be 54,887 ASes (69, 488 − 14, 601, which is Tata’s customer cone).
The other extreme is a completely flat network, where every
network is fully meshed and there are only peering connections
between networks. Any individual network would only use each
network to reach that network, meaning every network has a re-
liance of 1AS on every other network. We assume that in this
topology networks do not provide transit for others.
7.2 Cloud Provider Reliance
We map reliance for the four cloud providers after calculating
hierarchy-free reachability (§6.4), where the cloud providers bypass
their individual transit providers, Tier-1 ISPs, and Tier-2 ISPs. Fig-
ure 6 shows the cloud providers’ reliance on individual ASes (x-axis,

using intervals of 25 for bins and readability), and the number of
ASes that have a specific reliance (y-axis, in log scale).
Overall, we can see the cloud providers generally have low re-
liance on any individual network. The cloud providers have a re-
liance of ≤ 600 for all but a handful of networks. IBM and Ama-
zon are the only two cloud providers with reliance ≥ 800 for any
network. The top three reliance per cloud provider can be seen in
Table 2. Amazon has the highest reliance on any individual network,
5,889 ASes for Durand do Brasil (AS 22356) (not shown in Fig. 6 for
readability), but they also had the fewest number of neighbors.
Gauging where the cloud providers are with respect to the two
extreme hierarchies (fully meshed and fully hierarchical), we can
see that the cloud providers’ reliance is closer to a completely
flat topology than hierarchical. The cloud providers do still have
