Abstract. Ad networks (e.g., Google Ads and Facebook Ads), adver-
tisers, publishers (websites and mobile apps), and users are the main
participants in the online advertising ecosystem. Ad networks dominate
the advertising landscape in terms of determining how to pair advertisers
with publishers and what ads are shown to a user. Previous works have
studied the issues surrounding how ad networks tailor ads to a user (i.e.,
the ad targeting mechanisms) extensively and mainly from the perspec-
tive of users. However, it is largely unknown regarding the practices of
how ad networks match between advertisers and publishers.
In this paper, we present a measurement study of the practices of how
ad networks pair advertisers with publishers as well as advertisers’ pref-
erence on ad networks from the perspective of advertisers. To do this, we
manage to harvest a unique advertising-related dataset from a leading
digital market intelligence platform. We conducted paired comparison
analysis, i.e., analyzing advertisers and publishers in pairs, to examine
whether they are signiﬁcantly similar or dissimilar to each other. We also
investigate if advertisers in diﬀerent categories have diﬀerent preferences
on ad networks, whether an advertiser partners with only one ad net-
work for its ad campaign, and how much traﬃc that its ad campaign
could bring about to its site. Speciﬁcally, we found that about a third of
advertisers have their ads mostly displayed on publishers with the same
category as themselves. In addition, most advertisers partner with multi-
ple ad networks at the same time for their ad campaigns. We also found
that the Adult, Romance & Relationships, and Gambling websites rely
on advertising to attract visitors more than other advertiser categories.
Our study produces insightful ﬁndings which provide advertisers more
visibility into the complex advertising ecosystem so that they could make
better decisions when launching ad campaigns.

advertisers, publishers, and users are the main parties in the online advertis-
ing ecosystem. Ad networks oversee the whole advertising business in terms of
connecting advertisers to publishers and determining what ads are displayed
to a user. An ad network is involved in every workﬂow step, including helping
an advertiser create an ad, partnering with millions of publishers to reserve ad
placement spots, proﬁling users based on user behavior tracking, and ﬁnally tai-
loring ads to a user visiting a partnered publisher. To some extent, ad networks
know all other three parties better than the parties know themselves.
However, ad networks fail to provide suﬃciently informative feedback reports
for other parties, especially advertisers which are ad networks’ revenue source, to
independently evaluate what could be a better advertising practice for them. For
example, ad networks usually provide ad campaign reports to inform advertisers
of post-click performance metrics about users who clicked on the ads and then
came through to the advertiser’s site. However, for an advertiser, such reports
typically fail to provide information about publishers where their own ads are
displayed and publishers where their peer advertisers operating similar business
get their ads delivered. Such information is certainly important for advertisers to
evaluate the eﬀectiveness of their ad campaigns through a horizontal comparison.
Previous works have studied the online advertising ecosystem mainly from the
perspective of users. Some works investigate the eﬀectiveness and transparency
of the ad targeting mechanisms leveraged by ad networks to match ads and users
[8–10,12,13,15,19,21,28,29]. Some propose mechanisms to promote user privacy
and social equality in online advertising [14,16,17,23,24,30,35,36,39]. A few
studies research on security issues caused by malicious usage of online advertising
[20,26,27,34,37,38,40,42]. However, there is still a lack of literature regarding
the advertiser-publisher pairings (i.e., what publishers display an advertiser’s
ads) and advertiser-ad network pairings (i.e., what ad networks are responsible
for distributing an advertiser’s ads) from an advertiser’s perspective.
In this paper, we present a measurement study of the practice of advertiser-
publisher pairings and advertiser-ad network pairings, for advertisers to gain a
better understanding of their own and peer advertisers’ ad campaigns. By com-
plementing feedback reports from ad networks, our study could oﬀer advertisers
additional insights into the advertising ecosystem.
A real-world dataset containing information about both advertisers and their
paired publishers and ad networks is central to the objective of our study. With
a list of top Alexa domains, we queried each of them against a popular web ana-
lytics service provider and managed to gather ample advertising-related infor-
mation regarding the domain, such as leading publishers where the domain’s ads
are displayed, leading ad networks responsible for the domain’s ad campaigns,
and the proportion of incoming traﬃc contributed by advertising.
With the dataset, we are able to conduct paired comparison analysis, i.e.,
analyzing advertisers and publishers in pairs, to examine whether they are sig-
niﬁcantly similar or dissimilar to each other, so that we may understand the
rationale why ad networks deliver an advertiser’s ads to one publisher rather
than another. We are well aware of the three primary ad targeting mechanisms,
566

i.e., contextual-based, behavioral-based, and remarketing-based [28], but in this
work, we are trying to explore objectively whether the similarity/dissimilarity
between advertisers and publishers could also be a possible factor for ad net-
works to associate advertisers and publishers together by ad delivering, besides
the ad targeting mechanisms.
In addition, our dataset also allows us to investigate if advertisers in diﬀerent
categories have diﬀerent preferences on ad networks, whether an advertiser only
partners with one ad network for its ad campaign, and how much traﬃc that
its ad campaign could bring about to its site. Speciﬁcally, we found that about
60% advertisers have their ads mostly delivered to the publishers which attract a
large volume of visitor traﬃc, such as news websites, social networks, and video
streaming services. And typically an advertiser’s site is usually not so popular
as its associative publisher in attracting visitor traﬃc. In addition, most adver-
tisers are found to partner with multiple ad networks at the same time for their
ad campaigns. Finally, we found that the Adult, Romance & Relationships,
and Gambling websites rely on advertising to attract visitors more than other
advertiser categories. We report our data collection and the ﬁndings in detail in
the rest sections.
2 Our Dataset
Ad networks, advertisers, publishers, and users are the main participants in the
online advertising ecosystem. Ad networks connect advertisers to publishers and
determine what ads are displayed to a user. When a user visits a publisher, views
or clicks on an ad, the corresponding advertiser would pay to the associative ad
network, which in turn pays a share to the publisher [1,7].
A representative real-world dataset, containing information about advertis-
ers, their paired publishers, and their partnered ad networks, is essential for
our study. In this section, we describe our data collection methodology and the
dataset we obtained.
Data Collection. Starting from a list of top 30K Alexa domains [3] (the reason
for the relatively small data is explained below), we queried each domain (or site,
used exchangeably in this paper) against SimilarWeb [4], a leading website cate-
gorization and analytics service. The reason we chose SimilarWeb over Alexa [2]
is that SimilarWeb provides us ample advertising-related information regarding
a domain, which is crucial to our study, such as ad networks partnered with the
domain, top publishers where its ads are displayed, as well as the proportion of
incoming traﬃc contributed by advertising.
Out of consideration of budget, in our study, we use the SimilarWeb service
with a free user account, which allows individual query only and limits 5 results
per metric if the metric has a list of values. For instance, given a domain, only
the top 5 ad networks responsible for its ad distribution are available. However,
the top 5 results of a metric usually contribute a signiﬁcant proportion together,
close to 100% sometimes, and thus the data is adequate for our statistical study.

Within a time period of two weeks, we conducted data collection in a semi-
automated manner. That is, given a top Alexa domain, we manually1 launched
a query against SimilarWeb, saved the result webpage locally as an HTML ﬁle,
and later on automatically parsed the HTML ﬁle with Python scripts. We have
made our dataset publicly available2.
Data Explained. For each domain, SimilarWeb provides us the following infor-
mation.
– Leading ad networks that the domain partners with to launch ad campaigns
(cid:129) Denoted as {| i = 1..5}, i.e., the top 5 ad net-
works adopted by the domain, and the percentage of ads each ad network
is responsible for.
– Leading publishers where most of the domain’s ads are displayed
– Advertising traﬃc to the domain’s website
(cid:129) Denoted as {P ublisheri| i = 1..5}.
(cid:129) Speciﬁcally, the percentage of incoming traﬃc due to advertising is pro-
vided, as well as the share of other traﬃc sources, including direct access,
referrals from other sites, search on search engines, social networks, and
emails.
– Traﬃc statistics of the domain, including the following information:
world.
consistent with the origin country of the site.
(cid:129) Category: the site’s category, determined based upon the web content.
(cid:129) Country: the country where the most visitors to the site are from, usually

online interests of the users visiting this site, and the percentage of audi-
ence in each interest category.

SimilarWeb Approach of Data Harvesting. SimilarWeb is an Israeli dig-
ital market intelligence company and is readying for an IPO on Nasdaq as of
this writing3. According to its own introduction about their data [5], Similar-
Web leverages hundreds of diverse data sources, calibrates data with real feed-
back, e.g., Google Analytics, and aggregates those mixed data sources through
machine learning algorithms into a single data set available to users. The hun-
dreds of data sources can be categorized into four groups: (i) public data points
easily obtained using crawling techniques, (ii) ﬁrst-party data directly shared
by website and mobile apps owners, (iii) external partners, e.g., Internet ser-
vice providers, who usually have millions of subscribers, and (iv) panel-based
behavioral data obtained through add-ons, extensions, apps and plugins.

due to the latter’s web scraping prevention measures.

Data Validity. In this study, we heavily rely on the dataset obtained by query-
ing a domain against SimilarWeb. Since how SimilarWeb collects and processes
data is still largely unknown to the public, we validated the dataset as fol-
lows. First, we compare SimilarWeb to other website ranking systems. Tranco is
a research-oriented ranking system, which is claimed to create robust rankings
transparently and reproducibly [6,33]. Hence we use Tranco as a benchmark and
then examine whether SimilarWeb ranking has a signiﬁcantly larger deviation
from Tranco ranking than the deviation of Alexa ranking from Tranco ranking.
We randomly selected 20,000 website domains and then obtained their rankings
in Tranco, SimilarWeb, and Alexa. We then calculated the deviation of Simi-
larWeb from Tranco ranking and the deviation of Alexa from Tranco ranking
for each domain, respectively. We plotted the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) curves in Fig. 1. It shows that (1) both SimilarWeb and Alexa rankings
could have a large deviation from Tranco ranking. Speciﬁcally, for about 70%-
75% domains, the diﬀerence of their website ranking value in SimilarWeb and
Alexa from that in Tranco could be larger than 10,000; (2) As for the deviation
from Tranco ranking, Alexa did not perform better than SimilarWeb, and the
ranking values provided by SimilarWeb are as trustworthy as those provided by
Alexa. Moreover, we compared SimilarWeb and Alexa in terms of other traﬃc
metrics and did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence either. For example,
Table 1 lists the traﬃc data returned by SimilarWeb and Alexa for espn.com.
As for the advertising-related data about a domain, unfortunately, we did not
ﬁnd any other web analytics services including Alexa that provide such data,
and thus we cannot perform a comparison as we do in Table 1. We assume
SimilarWeb provides trustworthy web analytics data.
Our Data Processing. Our research approach is to conduct paired comparison
analysis, i.e., analyzing advertisers and publishers in pairs, to examine whether
they are signiﬁcantly similar or dissimilar to each other. Thus, starting with the
raw data {P ublisheri| i = 1..5}, i.e., the top 5 publishers directing advertising

traﬃc to an advertiser, we parse it into ﬁve pairs ,
i = 1..5. In this way, we managed to extract 34,229 distinct pairs of adver-
tiser and publisher. There are 26,456 distinct domains in total in those 2-tuples,
including 16,870 distinct advertisers4 and 12,142 distinct publishers. Note that a
domain could advertise itself in other websites with the help of ad networks as an
advertiser and meanwhile host the ads from other websites as a publisher. And
9.7% (2,556 out of 26,456 sites) are found to be an advertiser and a publisher at
the same time. We choose not to exclude those domains or treat them diﬀerently,
since it is very common in the practice that a domain could take both the roles.
Data Representativeness. We examined the representativeness of our dataset
in terms of domain category distribution and domain country distribution.
Dataset Distribution by Domain Category. Figure 9 (placed in Appendix due to
page limit) depicts the distribution of the domains in the dataset by category5.
It shows that all those domains in our study fall into 30 categories. The top 5
categories, including Computers and Technology, News and Media, Arts and
Entertainment, Science and Education, and Games, account for 44.0% of all
domains. None of the domains in the rest categories occupy more than 5%. Thus,
the domains in our study are quite diverse in category.
Dataset Distribution by Domain Country. The country which contributes the
most traﬃc to a domain is deemed as its primary country. All the domains
are found to be from 119 countries, and those primary countries contribute
57.8% traﬃc to a domain on average. The top 20 countries shown in Fig. 10 (in
Appendix) account for 88.5% of all domains. Nearly a half (47.7%) of domains are
from the United States. Our dataset seems biased in this metric, but actually
it makes sense, given that United States owns about 41.0% of know registered
domains based on the domain name registration’s statistics6.
4 Several hundreds of domains in our original domain list were removed, since Similar-
Web did not manage to obtain their corresponding publisher information. Actually,
it is common and normal that SimilarWeb may not return complete data for each
data ﬁeld we described before.
5 As explained before, the category information is provided by SimilarWeb.

3 Paired Comparison Analysis
In this section, we conduct paired comparison analysis, i.e., analyzing advertis-
ers and publishers in pairs, to examine whether they are signiﬁcantly similar
or dissimilar to each other. We also check how much traﬃc that advertisers’
ad campaigns with ad networks could bring to their sites as well as which ad
networks are popular with advertisers. We report our analysis results on 34,229
pairs of advertisers and publishers in below.
