## Abstract
Ad networks (e.g., Google Ads and Facebook Ads), advertisers, publishers (websites and mobile apps), and users are the main participants in the online advertising ecosystem. Ad networks play a crucial role in determining how to pair advertisers with publishers and what ads are shown to users. Previous research has extensively studied ad targeting mechanisms from the user's perspective. However, there is limited understanding of how ad networks match advertisers with publishers.

In this paper, we present a measurement study of the practices of how ad networks pair advertisers with publishers and advertisers' preferences for ad networks. We collected a unique dataset from a leading digital market intelligence platform. Using paired comparison analysis, we examined the similarity or dissimilarity between advertisers and publishers. We also investigated whether advertisers in different categories have different preferences for ad networks, whether they partner with multiple ad networks, and the traffic generated by their ad campaigns.

Our findings show that about one-third of advertisers have their ads primarily displayed on publishers in the same category. Most advertisers partner with multiple ad networks simultaneously. Additionally, adult, romance and relationships, and gambling websites rely more heavily on advertising to attract visitors compared to other categories. Our study provides valuable insights into the complex advertising ecosystem, helping advertisers make more informed decisions.

## 1. Introduction
Online advertising is the primary revenue source for millions of websites and mobile apps, making it essential to the Internet ecosystem. The main participants in the online advertising ecosystem are ad networks, advertisers, publishers, and users. Ad networks manage the entire process, connecting advertisers to publishers and determining which ads are displayed to users. They are involved in every step, from creating ads to profiling users and tailoring ads to individual users.

However, ad networks often fail to provide sufficient feedback to advertisers, who are their primary revenue source. For example, ad campaign reports typically lack information about the publishers where ads are displayed and the performance of similar advertisers. This information is crucial for advertisers to evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns.

Previous research has focused on the user's perspective, investigating ad targeting mechanisms, privacy, and security issues. There is a lack of literature on the pairing of advertisers and publishers and the preferences of advertisers for ad networks. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a detailed measurement study.

## 2. Our Dataset
### 2.1 Data Collection
We started with a list of the top 30,000 Alexa domains and queried each domain using SimilarWeb, a leading website analytics service. SimilarWeb provides extensive advertising-related information, such as the top 5 ad networks, leading publishers, and the proportion of incoming traffic due to advertising.

Due to budget constraints, we used a free SimilarWeb account, which limits results to the top 5 for each metric. However, these top 5 results often contribute significantly to the total, making them adequate for our study. We collected data semi-automatically over two weeks, saving and parsing HTML files with Python scripts. Our dataset is publicly available at [https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/Da1yvg4QuKftCBjMpNsD](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/Da1yvg4QuKftCBjMpNsD).

### 2.2 Data Explained
For each domain, SimilarWeb provides:
- **Leading Ad Networks:** Top 5 ad networks and the percentage of ads they handle.
- **Leading Publishers:** Top 5 publishers displaying the domain's ads.
- **Advertising Traffic:** Percentage of incoming traffic due to advertising.
- **Traffic Statistics:** Global rank, visits, category, country, and audience interests.
- **Audience Interests:** Top 5 online interests of the site's visitors.

### 2.3 Data Validity
To validate our dataset, we compared SimilarWeb rankings to Tranco, a robust ranking system. We found that both SimilarWeb and Alexa rankings had similar deviations from Tranco, indicating that SimilarWeb's data is as reliable as Alexa's. We also compared other traffic metrics and found no significant differences.

### 2.4 Data Processing
We conducted paired comparison analysis, examining the similarity or dissimilarity between advertisers and publishers. We extracted 34,229 distinct pairs of advertisers and publishers from the dataset. Some domains act as both advertisers and publishers, but we did not exclude them as this is common practice.

### 2.5 Data Representativeness
Our dataset is diverse in terms of domain categories and countries. The top 5 categories (Computers and Technology, News and Media, Arts and Entertainment, Science and Education, and Games) account for 44.0% of all domains. The United States contributes the most traffic, which aligns with the high number of registered domains in the U.S.

## 3. Paired Comparison Analysis
In this section, we analyze the 34,229 pairs of advertisers and publishers to examine their similarity or dissimilarity. We also investigate the traffic generated by ad campaigns and the popularity of different ad networks among advertisers.

- **Similarity Analysis:** About one-third of advertisers have their ads displayed on publishers in the same category.
- **Multiple Ad Networks:** Most advertisers partner with multiple ad networks.
- **Traffic Generation:** Adult, romance and relationships, and gambling websites rely more on advertising to attract visitors.

These findings provide valuable insights into the advertising ecosystem, helping advertisers make better-informed decisions.

## 4. Conclusion
This study provides a detailed analysis of the practices of how ad networks pair advertisers with publishers and the preferences of advertisers for ad networks. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the similarity between advertisers and publishers and the benefits of partnering with multiple ad networks. These insights can help advertisers optimize their ad campaigns and improve their overall performance in the online advertising ecosystem.
