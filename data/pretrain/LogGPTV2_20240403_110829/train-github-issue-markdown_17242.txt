### Describe the problem
Tensorflow attempts to swap-out a node to the CPU to save memory, even when
the node is already on CPU.
This happens in `core/grappler/optimizers/memory_optimizers.cc` with the op
`_CopyFromGpuToHost`.  
But since this swapping is intended to save GPU memory by swapping temporarily
nodes from GPU to the the CPU, the kernel for that op in
`core/grappler/optimizers/gpu_swapping_kernels.cc` is only for GPU devices.
A suggested fix will be to simply check if the node to be swapped out is
already in CPU before making it eligible for swap_out/swap_in. Note that on
reducing the model size this error disappears as more memory becomes free.
#### Some more information confirming the issue -
The op is correctly registered in OpRegistry as shown by
`tensorflow::OpRegistry::Global()->DebugString(false)`.  
The OpKernel `CopyFromGpuToHostKernel` is built according to bazel logs.  
The OpKernel is loaded on importing tensorflow in python, verified by adding a
print in that file using `__attribute__((constructor)) )`
