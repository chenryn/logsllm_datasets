Parameters
Parameter
Description
=
Maps COM  to 
/d 
Deletes the mapping for COM 
/query
Displays the current port mappings.
/?
Displays help at the command prompt.
Remarks
Most MS-DOS applications support only COM1 through COM4 serial ports. The change port command maps a serial port to a different port number, allowing apps that don't support high-numbered COM ports to access the serial port. Remapping works only for the current session and is not retained if you log off from a session and then log on again.
Use change port without any parameters to display the available COM ports and their current mappings.
Examples
To map COM12 to COM1 for use by an MS-DOS-based application, type:
change port com12=com1
To display the current port mappings, type:
change port /query
