### Change Port Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `change port` command is used to list or modify COM port mappings, ensuring compatibility with MS-DOS applications. Most MS-DOS applications only support COM1 through COM4. This command allows you to map higher-numbered COM ports to these lower numbers, enabling the applications to access the serial ports.

**Note:**
To learn about the latest features and updates, refer to [What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server](#).

**Syntax:**
```shell
change port [= <source_port>=<target_port> | /d <port> | /query]
```

**Parameters:**

- `=<source_port>=<target_port>`: Maps the specified source COM port to the target COM port.
- `/d <port>`: Deletes the mapping for the specified COM port.
- `/query`: Displays the current port mappings.
- `/?`: Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- The `change port` command is useful for remapping COM ports to ensure compatibility with MS-DOS applications that only support COM1 through COM4.
- Remappings are session-specific and are not retained after logging off and on again.
- To view the available COM ports and their current mappings, use the `change port` command without any parameters.

**Examples:**

1. **Map COM12 to COM1:**
   ```shell
   change port com12=com1
   ```

2. **Display the current port mappings:**
   ```shell
   change port /query
   ```

By using the `change port` command, you can effectively manage COM port mappings to support legacy MS-DOS applications on modern Windows Server versions.
