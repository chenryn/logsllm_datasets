I'm trying to work out how to compile all of my TypeScript components to one
JavaScript file. My app will have 50-100 components, so it's obviously not
feasible to load them individually using `System.import()`.
Concatenating compiled JavaScript files doesn't work because of the duplicate
code. Concatenating the TypeScript files almost works, except for all the
duplicate `import` symbols.
How to do this?
