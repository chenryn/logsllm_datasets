User: Iâ€™m trying to bulk insert data to SQL server express database. When doing bcp from Windows XP command prompt, I get the following error:
C:\temp>bcp  in  -T -f  -S 

Starting copy...
SQLState = S1000, NativeError = 0
Error = [Microsoft][SQL Native Client]Unexpected EOF encountered in BCP data-file

0 rows copied.
Network packet size (bytes): 4096
Clock Time (ms.) Total     : 4391
So, there is a problem with EOF. How to append a correct EOF character to this file using Perl or Python?
Assistant: This is not a problem with missing EOF, but with EOF that is there and is not expected by bcp.
I am not a bcp tool expert, but it looks like there is some problem with format of your data files.
