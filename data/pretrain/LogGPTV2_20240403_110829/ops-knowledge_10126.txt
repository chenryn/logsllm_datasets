User: I'm writing a python program that I want to run differently whether it runs on the windows command prompt or windows powershell. I was wondering if there was a way to determine the environment python runs on within the program.
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: You can try one solution. You can call some powershell command as Write-Host (echo equivalent in cmd) from Python code and get call result. If it fails is not PowerShell. (I can not test it now).
