_Versions:_
  * **react** : 16.8.0-alpha-0
  * **react-dom** : 16.8.0-alpha-0
  * **react-form-uncontrolled** : 0.3.1
### Problem
I wrote a simple Form library with just one hook (react-form-uncontrolled).
However, **using this library** is displaying this error:
> Invariant Violation: Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function
> component
Codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/znx2r55lkp
Although the error says that it can only be called inside the body of a
function component, is already on the body...
Original library code:
    import React, { useCallback } from 'react'
    function Form(props) {
      const onSubmitForm = useCallback(event => {
        event.preventDefault()
        event.stopPropagation()
        const { onSubmit = () => {} } = props
        const fields = Array.prototype.slice.call(event.target)
          .filter(field => field.name)
          .reduce((form, { name, value }) => ({
            ...form,
            [name]: typeof value === 'string'
              ? value.trim()
              : value,
          }), {})
        onSubmit(fields)
      }, [])
      const { children } = props
      return (
          {children}
      )
    }
    function Input(props) {
      const { label, name } = props
      return (
          {label}
      )
    }
    module.exports = {
      Form, Input,
    }
At the beginning I thought that was for the Babel transpilation. Nevertheless,
running a codesandbox using the transpiled code instead of the library, is
working well:

Downgrading these versions in the project that use the library, it works:
  * **react** -> from 16.8.0-alpha.0 -> to 16.7.0-alpha.2
  * **react-dom:** from 16.8.0-alpha.0 -> to 16.7.0-alpha.2
So looks that for some reason with 16.8.0-alpha.0 is not compatible.
