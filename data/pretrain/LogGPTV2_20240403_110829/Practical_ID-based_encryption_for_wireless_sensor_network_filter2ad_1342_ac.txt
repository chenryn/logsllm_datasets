4. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
There are only 3 existing online/oﬄine IBE schemes, two
of them are proposed by Guo, Mu and Chen in [9] and one
of them is proposed by Liu and Zhou [12]. We use GMC-
1, GMC-2 and LZ to denote them respectively. We also
assume that |G| = 160 bits, |q| = 160 bits, |GT| = 1024
bits and message space is 128 bits for the following compari-
son. Assume AES is used for the symmetric key encryption,
where both the key size and ciphertext size are 128 bits. In
order to make it CCA secure, we use another MAC func-
tion which adds further 80 bits to the ciphertext. For the
online/oﬄine signature scheme used in GMC-1, we adopt
Boneh and Boyen’s [4] construction which requires 320-bit
oﬄine, 320-bit online signatures and 320-bit public/private
keys (by assuming some group elements can be shared be-
tween diﬀerent keys).
Table 1 shows the comparison between our scheme and other
OOIBE schemes, in the case of encrypting one single mes-
sage. The diﬀerences can be summarized as follow:
1. When compared to the scheme in the full security
model (GMC-2), both the oﬄine storage and cipher-
text size of our scheme are 4 times smaller than GMC-
2. Again, as described before, selective-ID security is
not really weak in our scenario.
2. When compared to the scheme in selective-ID model
(GMC-1), both the oﬄine storage and ciphertext size
of our scheme are 2 times smaller than GMC-1. Even
if we compare to the random oracle scheme (LZ), our
scheme still achieves a smaller oﬄine storage (2 times
smaller).
3. In terms of computation requirement, we do not re-
quire any point addition operation (M operation) in
the online encryption stage for both schemes. Mod-
ular computation (mc operation) and symmetric key
encryption (SE operation) are much faster than M
operation. Thus the online encryption stages of our
scheme is faster than GMC-1 and GMC-2.
4. We also note that schemes in the random oracle are
usually more eﬃcient than those in the standard model,
due to the weaken security level. However, our scheme
achieves similar or even outstanding performance over
the random oracle scheme (LZ).
The probability that the former happens is bounded by the
collision-resistent hash function H, where the probability
that the latter happens is 1=p. Considering that there are
qD decryption queries, Equation (4) holds.
Figure 1 shows another comparison on oﬄine storage.
In
this case, there are a number of messages to be sent to one
receiver.
It is very common in WSN for a sensor to send
multiple messages to a base station. Since the oﬄine compu-
tation and oﬄine storage are independent of the number of

This makes our scheme really practical for wireless sensor
nodes.

messages to be encrypted in our schemes, the eﬃciency gain
can be magniﬁed when more messages will be sent, say, 100
messages. So when the number of receivers is limited, our
schemes can achieve much better performance when com-
pared to previous OOIBE schemes.
Again, even for encrypting one message, our scheme is more
eﬃcient than all OOIBE schemes in the literature. Therefore
using RB-OOIBE to encrypt messages directly is better than
using OOIBE schemes to encrypt a symmetric key and then
using this symmetric key to encrypt messages.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a new notion called Receiver-
Bounded Online/Oﬄine ID-based Encryption. We also pre-
sented a concrete RB-OOIBE construction. The eﬃciency
improvements of our scheme over previous schemes are very
clear, especially in the case that many messages are en-
crypted for one receiver. In general, a wireless sensor node
has three main limitations: energy, computation power and
storage. For energy saving, our scheme provides the shortest
ciphertext length compared to other OOIBE schemes. By
the online/oﬄine property, the sensor node doesn’t need any
