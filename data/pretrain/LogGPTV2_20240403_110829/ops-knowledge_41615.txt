User: How to perform network troubleshooting and check whether the network devices and network links are normal?
Assistant: The following are the steps to perform network troubleshooting and check whether the network equipment and network link are normal: 1. Check the cable connection: check whether the cable is plugged in, whether it is damaged, whether it is loose, etc., if there is a problem, re-plug or replace the cable. 2. Check network equipment: Check whether routers, switches, network cards and other equipment are working normally, whether restarting, updating software, etc. are required. 3. Check the IP address and gateway: Check whether the IP address of the device in the network is correct, including the machine and router, and whether the gateway is connected normally. 4. Use the ping command to check the network link: enter "ping target IP address" (for example: ping 192.168.1.1) on the command line to check whether the connection is successful. If there is an error message, it means that there is a problem with the network connection. 5. Check the DNS settings: If you cannot access the Internet, it is possible that the DNS server settings are incorrect and need to be checked and reconfigured. 6. Check firewall and security settings: In some cases, firewall and security settings may block network connections, and settings need to be checked and adjusted. 7. Scan for viruses and malware: Some viruses and malware may affect network connections and device work, and need to be scanned and removed with antivirus software. The above are some common methods for network troubleshooting, checking whether the network devices and network links are normal, and if the problem still cannot be solved, you can seek professional help.
