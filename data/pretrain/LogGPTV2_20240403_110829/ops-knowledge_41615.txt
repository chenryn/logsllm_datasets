To effectively perform network troubleshooting and ensure that all network devices and links are functioning properly, follow these steps:

1. **Inspect Cable Connections:** Verify that all cables (Ethernet, fiber optic, etc.) are securely connected to the appropriate ports on your devices. Look for any visible signs of damage or wear, and replace or re-secure them as needed.

2. **Evaluate Network Equipment Status:** Assess the operational status of key networking components such as routers, switches, and network interface cards (NICs). If you encounter issues, consider restarting the devices, updating their firmware, or checking for any error messages in the device logs.

3. **Verify IP Configuration:** Ensure that each device's IP address is correctly configured, including both the machine and the router. Additionally, confirm that the default gateway setting is accurate and that communication between the device and the gateway is uninterrupted.

4. **Test Connectivity Using Ping Command:** To check the integrity of a network connection, use the `ping` command followed by the target IP address (e.g., `ping 192.168.1.1`). This tool sends packets to the specified destination and reports back on their round-trip time and success rate. A failed ping often indicates a problem with the path to the target.

5. **Review DNS Settings:** If internet access remains unavailable despite successful pings, investigate the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration. Incorrect DNS server addresses can prevent proper name resolution, making web browsing and other online services inaccessible. Adjust the settings to point to known, reliable DNS servers if necessary.

6. **Adjust Firewall and Security Policies:** Sometimes, overly restrictive firewall rules or security software configurations can block legitimate traffic. Review and modify these policies to allow necessary communications while maintaining adequate protection against threats.

7. **Scan for Malware and Viruses:** Perform a comprehensive scan using up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware tools to detect and remove any malicious software that might be interfering with network performance or causing unexpected behavior.

If, after following these steps, the issue persists, it may be advisable to consult with an IT professional who can provide more advanced diagnostics and support.
