# Diagnosing Path Inflation of Mobile Client Traffic

## Abstract
This paper examines the issue of path inflation in mobile client traffic, using a comprehensive set of longitudinal measurements gathered from smartphones across various regions and carrier networks. We provide a taxonomy of causes for path inflation, identify the underlying reasons behind observed cases, and quantify their impact. Our findings indicate that a lack of carrier ingress points or provider peering points can lead to significant detours, but overall, routes tend to improve as carrier and provider topologies evolve. The dataset is publicly available at [http://mpm.cs.usc.edu](http://mpm.cs.usc.edu), and our ongoing work includes developing techniques for the automatic detection of evolving topology issues.

## 1. Introduction
Path inflation, where data packets travel longer distances than necessary, can significantly impact network performance. This paper investigates the root causes of path inflation in mobile client traffic and provides a detailed analysis of its effects. We use a large dataset of traceroutes collected from smartphones to diagnose and quantify the extent of path inflation in different regions and carrier networks.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Data Collection
We collected traceroute data from smartphones located in diverse regions and carrier networks over an extended period. The data includes information on the round-trip time (RTT) and path length for each traceroute.

### 2.2 Analysis
We analyzed the collected data to identify instances of path inflation and determine the root causes. Table 1 shows the aggregate results for three major metropolitan areas: Seattle, New York City (NYC), and San Francisco (SF).

| Region | Count | Fraction Inflated | Extra Distance (km) | Extra RTT (ms) | Extra PLT (ms) |
|--------|-------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Seattle | 7759  | 1.00             | 4200               | 31.5          | 315            |
| NYC    | 303   | 1.00             | 2106               | 15.8          | 158            |
| SF     | 2720  | 1.00             | 2148               | 16.1          | 161            |
| Total  | 20528 | 0.30             | 2178               | 16.3          | 163            |
| Other  | 2435  | 0.33             | 1974               | 14.8          | 148            |
| Total  | 7029  | 0.98             | 694                | 5.2           | 52             |

### 2.3 Root Cause Analysis
#### 2.3.1 Ingress Points
- **Verizon**: Most traceroutes from Verizon clients in NYC went to servers near Washington, D.C., indicating a small geographic detour.
- **AT&T**: Traceroutes from AT&T clients in NYC had the first public hop in Chicago, suggesting a lack of a closer ingress point. AT&T clients in SF were served by a nearby Google server, but the traffic went from SF to Seattle before returning to the server in SF, increasing the RTT by at least 31 ms.

#### 2.3.2 Peering Points
- **Sprint**: In 2011, most traceroutes from Sprint users in LA were directed to Google servers in Texas or SF. By Q2 2012, an additional peering point between Sprint and Google near LA was observed, leading to more direct routes.

## 3. Evolution of Root Causes
### 3.1 Ingress Points
Figure 1 maps the observed ingress points at the end of 2011. While our dataset is limited, we see indications of improvement. Some carriers doubled the number of ingress points, allowing for more direct routes from clients to services.

### 3.2 Peering Points
Table 2 summarizes the observed peering points between carriers and Google. Over time, new peering points have been established, reducing the need for long detours.

| Carrier       | 2011 Q4 Peering Locations | 2012 Q2 Peering Locations | 2012 Q4 Peering Locations |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| AT&T          | CHI, DFW, HOU, MSP, PDX, SAT, SFO | + ATL, CMH, DEN | + LAX, MIL, MIA |
| Sprint        | ASH, ATL, CHI, DFW, LGA, SEA, SFO | + LAX | + ASH, MIA |
| T-Mobile      | DCA, DFW, LAX, LGA, MSP, SEA, SFO | - | - |
| Verizon       | ATL, CHI, DAL, DCA, DFW, HOU, LAX, SCL, SEA, SFO | - | - |

## 4. Path Inflation Today
Our measurements show that many instances of path inflation in the US have disappeared over time. However, we still observe persistent issues in other regions. For example:
- **Nawras (Oman)**: Clients are directed to servers in Paris, France, instead of closer servers in New Delhi, India, increasing the round trip distance by over 7000 km.
- **E-Plus (Germany)**: Clients in southern Germany are directed to Paris or Hamburg servers instead of a close-by server in Munich.
- **Movistar (Spain)**: Clients are directed to servers in London instead of local servers in Madrid.

These instances suggest that path inflation remains a global issue, motivating the need for a continuous measurement infrastructure to identify and diagnose such problems.

## 5. Conclusions
This paper provides a detailed analysis of path inflation in mobile client traffic. We found that a lack of carrier ingress points or provider peering points can cause lengthy detours, but routes generally improve as carrier and provider topologies evolve. Our dataset is publicly available, and our ongoing work includes developing techniques for the automatic detection of evolving topology issues.
