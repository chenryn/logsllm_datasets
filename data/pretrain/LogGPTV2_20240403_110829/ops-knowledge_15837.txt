To effectively implement CIS Control 9.6, "Block Unnecessary File Types," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Identify and Categorize File Types**: Begin by identifying and categorizing the file types that are necessary for your organization's operations. This includes understanding which file types are commonly used and which are rarely or never needed.

2. **Develop a File Type Whitelist**: Create a whitelist of allowed file types based on the categorization. This list should include only those file types that are essential for business operations.

3. **Configure Email Gateway Filters**: Configure the email gateway to block all file types that are not on the whitelist. This ensures that only approved file types can enter the organizationâ€™s network via email, reducing the risk of malicious files being delivered.

4. **Regularly Review and Update Policies**: Regularly review and update the whitelist and email gateway configurations to adapt to changing organizational needs and emerging threats. This helps maintain the effectiveness of the control over time.

5. **Monitor and Log**: Implement monitoring and logging to track any attempts to deliver blocked file types. This can help in identifying potential security incidents and improving the overall security posture.

CIS Control 9.6 is categorized under the asset type "Network" and falls under the security function "Protect." By following these steps, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of malware and other threats entering their network through unnecessary file types.
