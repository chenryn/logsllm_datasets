Hello,

I am forwarding a bug report that was originally filed in the Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS) at [http://bugs.debian.org/564774](http://bugs.debian.org/564774). The bug is reported for version 1.3.0, but I have also been able to reproduce it with version 1.4.1.

The key part of the issue is as follows (please refer to the link above for additional details):

```python
import numpy as np
np.savez('test.npz', np.ones((10000, 1000)))
```

After running the above code, the file size is:

```bash
$ ls -lh *.npz
-rw-r--r-- 1 michael michael 77M 2010-01-11 15:52 test.npz
```

When compressing the file using `gzip`:

```bash
$ gzip test.npz
$ ls -lh test*.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 michael michael 114K 2010-01-11 15:52 test.npz.gz
```

As you can see, the compressed file size is significantly smaller, which suggests that the `.npz` file is not being efficiently compressed by default.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,  
Sandro
