addresses. Therefore, an aggregate approach is adopted in
determining the presence of an attack. DoS attacks target-
ing the network layer of a device require a large volume
of trafﬁc. Therefore, monitoring at an aggregate level will
show an anomaly when a network is under attack.
The pair of SYN and ACK packets can be used to detect
an attack because of two reasons. First, the external ﬁre-
wall is a stateful device and will not allow ACK packets
not associated with an existing connection to pass. The
result of this is that an attacker cannot ﬂood a target with
a mixture of both SYN and ACK packets in an attempt to
hide the attack from the TLAS since the ACKs will not
traverse the ﬁrewall.
The second reason the SYN and ACK packets are a
good choice is that they both come from an external ter-
minal and are connected using information generated by
an internal terminal. It is very difﬁcult for an attacker to
spoof the source address of a SYN packet and then gener-
ate a correct ACK packet because the SYN-ACK packet
generated by the target enterprise server will be sent to the
spoofed address. The attacker might be able to view the
SYN-ACK packet if they were located on the data path be-
tween the target and the spoofed address, but this situation
is rare.
Using the SYN and ACK pair also allows for a short
observation period. The time between the two packets is
equal to the round trip time between the enterprise server
and the initiating machine. In the worst case, this value
would be on the order of several seconds. This close time
proximity between packets allows for a very fast detection
of attacks.
The response mechanisms for a transport layer attack
can be classiﬁed into three categories: end server re-
sponse, ﬁrewall response, and router response. At the end
server SYN cache [17] or SYN cookies [3] can be used to
reduce the amount of resources consumed by an incom-
ing SYN packet. Rate limiting at the ﬁrewall can be acti-
vated to decrease the frequency of incoming SYN packets
to the servers. Finally, Pushback and Aggregate Conges-
tion Control [18, 10] can be used by upstream providers to
drop offending ﬂows before they reach an enterprise net-
work’s border.
6. Experimental Evaluation of Initial Attack
Sensor Deployment
6.1. DoS Attack Models
To evaluate the performance of the ALAS, the following
three different DoS scenarios were considered.
Limited DoS Attack:
It involves a single URI being tar-
geted by one or more attackers. The volume of incoming
attack calls was varied between different runs of the attack
from a low annoyance level of one hostile call per minute
to an overwhelming level of 10 or more hostile calls per
minute. This attack is extremely focused on disrupting on
a small number of end users and not on degrading the level
of service throughout the enterprise.
Stealth DoS Attack: This attack involves one or more
attackers targeting a large number of URIs within the en-
terprise. Each URI only receives a very low volume of
calls (e.g., one per minute or less). This results in a large
consumption of network wide resources while not modi-
fying the statistical network trafﬁc level by a signiﬁcant
amount.
Aggressive DoS Attack: This attack can be viewed as a
combination of the two previous cases. The impact and
detection of this attack can widely vary.
In evaluating
the ability of ALAS to detect this attack, a subtle vari-
ant was chosen because it is more difﬁcult to detect than
extremely large versions. One or more attackers initiated
a low level of calls to a moderate number of URIs. The
impact of the attack was two fold, 1) the end users were
successfully disrupted from their normal operations and
2) a large amount of network resources were consumed
causing other services to suffer.
For each scenario, the ALAS did detect the attack at
either the individual URI level or at the aggregate level.
In the aggressive attack, both TLAS and ALAS detected
the attack. The next section discusses several variations of
the initial attack detection algorithm.
6.2. Enterprise User Model
The user model was constructed to closely match that
of a large enterprise. The distribution of calls to differ-
ent URIs is shown in Table 1. The majority of URIs re-
ceived a very low volume of calls during the simulation
period. However, there are certain addresses within an
enterprise (e.g., help desk, front ofﬁce, etc.) that receive
a much higher volume of calls. To determine if the vol-
ume of legitimate calls affected the performance of the
sensors, both high and low volume users were included in
the model.

6.3. Simulation Parameters
ALAS was evaluated using three different recovery
techniques. The recovery techniques impacted how the
sensor operated once an attack had stopped. For each re-
covery algorithm, four simulations were run. Each sim-
ulation lasted for thirty minutes with the detection algo-
rithm sampling the volume of trafﬁc and calculating statis-
tics each minute.

covery (ouri = 2 and Turi = 5) (a) Attack 1 with
4 attack calls per minute and (b) Attack 2 with
10 attack calls per minute.
The ﬁrst two were limited DoS attacks using 4 hostile
calls per minute and 10 hostile calls per minute to a single
URI. To ensure that ALAS would detect the attack regard-
less of the volume of legitimate calls the URI received,
two URIs were targeted during each simulation. One of
the URIs received 2 to 5 calls during the simulation period
and the other received over 20 calls. The attacks were each
5 minutes in length and started on the second and seventh
minute of the simulation.
The other two simulations used a stealth DoS attack and
an aggressive DoS attack, respectively. The stealth attack
targeted 200 unique URIs out of the 1000 URIs within the
enterprise and generated one call a minute to each URI.
The aggressive attack used 50 unique URIs, but increased
the number of calls to 3 per minute to each target. The
attacks lasted 10 minutes and began on the second minute
of the simulation.
The offset values, ouri and oagg, were set to 2 and 1, re-
spectively. The attack thresholds, Turi and Tagg, were set
to 5 and 2. The value E for the discrete timeout algorithm
was set to 2.
6.4. Experimental Results
For each sensor conﬁguration, two key metrics were
used to determine its performance: attack detection time
and system recovery time. Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the
sensor’s detection of a limited DoS attack. Figures 9 and
10 show the detection plots for an aggressive and stealth
DoS attack respectively.
By choosing the offset and threshold values appropri-
ately, the false alarm rate was reduced to zero for all sim-
