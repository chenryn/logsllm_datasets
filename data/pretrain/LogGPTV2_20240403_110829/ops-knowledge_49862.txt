User: I am using Django 1.5.4 to design a web page in which i want to use GPIO, but i got following error:
"Noﾠaccessﾠtoﾠ/dev/mem. Tryﾠrunningﾠasﾠroot! "
in browser. Since web browser itself is an application, how can i assign "root" privileges to it when it tried to render a web page ? If it can be done without any need to install anything that would be better as other frameworks/applications who are able to use GPIO in web page must have made some tweaks.I tried searching for similar questions for this area but couldn't find this specific case ( django + gpio access).
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Assistant: You don't have to run the webbrowser as root but your django app (the webserver).
Of course running a web application as root is an incredibly bad idea (even on a pi), so you might want to use a separate worker process (e.g. using celery) that runs as root and accesses the GPIOs.
