arrival and departure time that are required to evaluate the perfor-
mance of systems using smaller slot sizes.
We revisit this issue in Section 6 using our own UCSB dataset
with a 0.65s sweeping time. We show that because original owners
display highly random access patterns, reducing slot sizes helps but
does not eliminate the need for conservative spectrum access. Thus
the problem of low extraction rate still remains.
Impact of Primary User Disruption Limit.
The design of ac-
cess strategies implies that the primary user disruption limit has a
signiﬁcant impact on the extraction rate. For example, the extrac-
tion rate of NKA scales linearly with the disruption limit. To under-
stand this dependency for SKA, we plot in Figure 8(a) the average
extraction rate as a function of the primary user disruption limit.
As expected, relaxing the disruption limit improves the spectrum
extraction rate. On the other hand, the relationship between the
two is non-linear. In fact, it can be proved that when the probabil-
ity of primary user returning to a channel increases monotonically
with existing channel idle time, SKA’s spectrum extraction rate is a
monotonically increasing and concave function of the primary user
disruption limit. We omit the proof due to the space limitation. Be-
cause of such non-linearity, we can show that the gain of SKA over
NKA shrinks as the primary user disruption limit increases, which
is also conﬁrmed by Figure 8(b).
4.3 Available vs. Extracted Spectrum
Our second question is whether the average spectrum availability
is a reliable predictor of the amount of spectrum extracted. Answer-
ing this question is particularly important because many existing
studies have been using the average spectrum availability to evalu-
ate opportunistic access. Using the RWTH dataset, we re-evaluate
this claim by examining the relationship between the amount of
spectrum extracted and the amount of spectrum available.
We ﬁrst plot the extraction rate as a function of the average spec-
trum availability. Using the segments discussed in Section 4.2,
Figure 9(a) and (b) show the spectrum extraction rate for all the
GSM1800DL segments at NED, as a function of the average spec-
trum availability of each segment. As expected, NKA extracts
about 10% available spectrum due to the 0.1 primary user disrup-
tion limit. The results display some small variations, especially at

(c) Spectrum Extracted, SKA
Figure 9: Scatter plots of spectrum extraction rates of GSM1800DL at NED with 0.1 primary user disruption limit. (a) NKA leads to
roughly 10% extraction rate. (b) SKA becomes more effective when the spectrum availability increases, although there is signiﬁcant
variance at higher availability values. (c) But, the spectrum availability is no longer an accurate indicator of the spectrum extracted,
due to the large variance at high availability values.

Figure 10: Cumulative distributions of secondary user’s blocking and service time, measured on all three locations, using a 2-hour
segment of randomly selected channels (same as the channels used in Figure 5), using SKA and 0.1 primary user disruption limit.
We see that the median blocking time is an order of magnitude higher than the primary user busy time in Figure 5, while the median
service time is an order of magnitude smaller than the primary user idle time.
low availability values. This is because some segments have fewer
idle periods where the performance of a random access scheme like
NKA does not converge to its expected value of 10%. Nevertheless,
the extraction rate remains stable for all the availability values.
SKA’s extraction rate, however, shows signiﬁcant variance, espe-
cially at high spectrum availability regions. This is not triggered by
the lack of idle instances, but the large variations in the distribution
of primary user idle time. While many segments display similar
average availability, their primary user idle time distributions and
access strategies are signiﬁcantly different, leading to notably large
difference in their extraction rates. Overall, we observe a weak re-
lationship between the extraction rate and the average availability.
Next, we compare the amount of spectrum extracted to the amount
of spectrum available. Intuitively, a channel with larger availabil-
ity will produce more usable spectrum using opportunistic access,
which has been widely used to evaluate opportunistic access [8, 5].
Our results in Figure 9(c) show that such claim can be problematic.
Again we observe signiﬁcant variance in terms of the actual amount
of spectrum extracted, particularly at high availability values. For
example, for GSM1800DL at NED, the uncertainty (standard devi-
ation/mean) of using the availability to predict the extracted spec-
trum is 36%. Therefore, an important conclusion from our analysis
is that spectrum availability is no longer a sole metric to evalu-
ate opportunistic spectrum access. One must also examine the ac-
cess strategy as well as the primary user idle time distribution when
comparing two frequency channels.
4.4 Usability of Extracted Spectrum
We also wish to understand the feasibility of using extracted
spectrum channels to serve traditional wireless applications. To
do so, we examine the statistical patterns of the channel service
and blocking time experienced by secondary devices. For each fre-
quency channel, the service time deﬁnes the time a secondary user
can continuously access the channel while the blocking time de-
ﬁnes the amount of time a secondary user must wait before access-
ing the channel.
Figure 10 shows the cumulative distribution of both metrics us-
ing the same set of channels in Figure 5 and the SKA scheme. Com-
paring this result to that of Figure 5 (the raw idle and busy duration
of the channel), we see that the service time is one order of mag-
nitude smaller than the primary user idle time, while the blocking
time is one order of magnitude larger than the primary user busy
time! While disappointing, this result is somewhat expected, given
that the extraction rate of SKA is <30%.
The absolute values are not promising. Secondary users expe-
rience prolonged blocking (2-200 seconds) and short service time
(2-10 seconds). This means that secondary users have a very lim-
