**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one):  
Feature
**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):
    Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"3", GitVersion:"v1.3.5+b0deb2e", GitCommit:"b0deb2eb8f4037421077f77cb163dbb4c0a2a9f5", GitTreeState:"not a git tree", BuildDate:"2016-08-21T12:21:36Z", GoVersion:"go1.7", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
    Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"3", GitVersion:"v1.3.5+coreos.0", GitCommit:"d7a04b1c6044647f5919fadf3cecb9ee70c10fc5", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2016-08-15T21:01:42Z", GoVersion:"go1.6.2", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : AWS
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CoreOS
  * **Install Method** : kube-aws
**Our use case** :  
We are extending our on premise infrastructure into the AWS Cloud. It's meant
to be _internal-only_ and we're taking measures to guarantee that security.
**Feature Request** :  
A method to guarantee that the environment _stays_ internal and does not
accidentally get exposed externally.
**Possible Methods I've explored** :
  * AWS IAM Policy to restrict kubernetes from creating a public ELB
  * AWS Security Group limiting client source IPs
I was speaking with @justinsb on #kubernetes-users on slack and he suggested I
submit a request for this here.
