### Section: Post-Engagement Cleanup

#### 11.2.1 Removing Entries from /etc/passwd

If you created a user account, it is essential to remove it. This includes cleaning up the corresponding entry in the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Why This Is Important:**
Failing to remove these entries could lead to the discovery of shared credentials for local administrator accounts, excessive domain admin privileges, or other vulnerabilities and attack vectors that were only uncovered after compromising a level-two system.

**Objective:**
The goal of this section is to teach you how to properly conduct post-engagement cleanup, rather than debating whether network penetration testing should be conducted.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **SSH into the Compromised Linux Server:**
   - Connect to the compromised Linux server using SSH as a user with root privileges.
   - If you do not know the root password, use the initial credentials you used to gain access to the system, and then elevate to root using the `pentest` entry added to the `/etc/passwd` file.

2. **Verify Current /etc/passwd Content:**
   - Use the `cat /etc/passwd` command to view the current contents of the `/etc/passwd` file. It should look something like this:
     ```plaintext
     lxd:x:105:65534::/var/lib/lxd/:/bin/false
     uuidd:x:106:110::/run/uuidd:/usr/sbin/nologin
     dnsmasq:x:107:65534:dnsmasq,,,:/var/lib/misc:/usr/sbin/nologin
     landscape:x:108:112::/var/lib/landscape:/usr/sbin/nologin
     pollinate:x:109:1::/var/cache/pollinate:/bin/false
     sshd:x:110:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
     nail:x:1000:1000:Nail:/home/nail:/bin/bash
     pentest:$1$pentest$NPv8jf8/11WqNhXAriGwa.:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
     ```

3. **Edit the /etc/passwd File:**
   - Open the `/etc/passwd` file in a text editor such as `vim`.
   - Scroll down to the last line, which contains the `pentest/root` account, and delete it.
   - Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. **Verify the Removal:**
   - Run the command `su pentest` from your SSH prompt to try to switch to the `pentest` user account.
   - You should see an error message saying, "No passwd entry for user ‘pentest’."
   - If you do not see this message, go back and ensure the entry has been properly removed.

#### 11.3 Removing Leftover Files from the Filesystem

Throughout your internal network penetration test (INPT), you may have left traces of your engagement on the systems you compromised. These traces are in the form of leftover files on the disk. Obvious risks include binary executables that could be used to compromise one of your client's systems. Less obvious files can also pose a risk, and leaving them behind would be unprofessional.

**Importance of Note-Taking:**
Keeping detailed notes of your activities during any penetration test is critical. This not only helps with proper post-engagement cleanup but also ensures that you can retrace your steps if something goes wrong. Accurate notes can help exonerate you if an issue arises and point your client in the right direction to resolve the problem.

**Steps to Remove Leftover Files:**

1. **Windows Registry Hive Copies:**
   - In section 6.2.1, you created copies of the SYSTEM and SAM Windows registry hives and placed them in the `c:\windows\temp` directory.
   - Delete these files using the following commands:
     ```bash
     del c:\windows\temp\sam
     del c:\windows\temp\sys
     ```
   - Verify the deletion by listing the contents of the directory with the `dir c:\windows\temp` command.

2. **SSH Key Pairs:**
   - In section 9.1.2, you uploaded an SSH key to a compromised Linux system to auto-connect to your attacking machine.
   - Remove the key pair by running the command:
     ```bash
     rm /root/.ssh/pentestkey*
     ```
   - Verify the removal with the command:
     ```bash
     ls -lah /root/.ssh
     ```

3. **Bash Script:**
   - The bash script you created in section 9.1.4 was placed in the `/tmp` directory and named `callback.sh`.
   - Remove it with the command:
     ```bash
     rm /tmp/callback.sh
     ```
   - Verify the removal with the command:
     ```bash
     ls -lah /tmp
     ```

4. **ntds.dit Copies:**
   - In section 10.3.1, you obtained a copy of the `ntds.dit` file and the SYSTEM registry hive file from the Capsulecorp Pentest domain controller.
   - Delete these files using the following commands:
     ```bash
     del c:\ntds.dit
     del c:\sys
     ```
   - Verify the deletion by listing the contents of the `C:` drive with the `dir c:\` command.

#### 11.4 Reversing Configuration Changes

As a pentester, it is often necessary to modify a server’s configuration to achieve a compromise. However, it is crucial to reverse these changes once the engagement is complete to avoid leaving the client's network in a more vulnerable state.

**Configuration Changes to Reverse:**

1. **Disabling MSSQL Stored Procedures:**
   - In chapter 6, you enabled the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure on a Microsoft SQL Server.
   - Connect to the target using the `sa` account and password.
   - Disable the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure with the following commands:
     ```sql
     sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', '0';
     RECONFIGURE;
     ```
   - Verify the disablement by attempting to run the `exec xp_cmdshell 'whoami'` command, which should fail.

2. **Disabling Anonymous File Shares:**
   - In chapter 6, you created an unrestricted file share called `pentest` to download the SYSTEM and SAM registry hive files.
   - Delete the share with the command:
     ```bash
     net share pentest /delete
     ```
   - Verify the deletion by running the `net share` command again.

3. **Removing Crontab Entries:**
   - In chapter 9, you configured a crontab entry to launch a bash script that establishes a remote connection to your attacking machine.
   - List the crontab entries with the command:
     ```bash
     crontab -l
     ```
   - Remove the crontab entry with the command:
     ```bash
     crontab -r
     ```
   - Verify the removal by running `crontab -l` again, which should return "no crontab for [username]."

#### 11.5 Closing Backdoors

Sometimes, it is necessary to add functionality to ensure reliable re-entry into a compromised host. When cleaning up, ensure that these backdoors are no longer accessible and delete any associated binary or executable files.

**Backdoors to Remove:**

1. **Undeploying WAR Files from Apache Tomcat:**
   - In section 5.3.2, you deployed a malicious WAR file to an unsecured Apache Tomcat server.
   - Log in to the Tomcat web management interface and scroll down to the Applications section.
   - Find the WAR file (e.g., `webshell`) and click Undeploy in the Commands column.
   - Verify the undeployment by browsing to the application URL, which should return a 404 Not Found message.

By following these steps, you can ensure a thorough and professional post-engagement cleanup, minimizing the risk of leaving vulnerabilities or traces of your penetration test.
