# G0010: Turla
## Description
Turla, a Russia-based threat group (also known as [G0010](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010)), has been active since 2004 and has targeted victims in over 45 countries. The group primarily focuses on government, embassy, military, educational, research, and pharmaceutical organizations. Notably, Turla's activity peaked in mid-2015. The group is known for employing sophisticated tactics such as watering hole attacks and spearphishing campaigns, and they use a variety of in-house tools and malware. While their primary espionage platform targets Windows machines, Turla has also been observed targeting macOS and Linux systems.
