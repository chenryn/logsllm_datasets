User: I want to debug a python script which is invoked via os.system() from another python script. I tried calling pdb.set_trace from the invoked code but it doesn't work. I can't see the Python pdb prompt.

Its sort of automation framework. My final python script where i want to put set_trace is like:
python script1.py --invokes--> script2.py --invokes--> script3.py (Here, in script3.py my set_trace is )
I'm working on linux with python 2.4
Assistant: If you are using output redirection, the pdb prompt will be redirected as well.
