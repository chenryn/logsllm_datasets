attack, for example... So we have to protect the
location, the server location. (IT2)
However, this “security by obscurity” approach suf-
fered from an accidental leak:
For example, we have requested that no URLs
were ever shared or showed on television, like
URLs of our platforms. And [partner organiza-
tion] forgot about it and shared URLs on tele-
vision... When this thing happened with the
URL, we had to basically disconnect everyone
from the platform and change the URL. (E2)
Though exposure of the URL only enabled attacks
on system availability/uptime—knowledge of the URLs
alone did not provide access to sensitive data—ICIJ was
concerned enough about these exposures that they chose
to take the systems temporarily ofﬂine in order to change
their locations.
Technical Limitations. Though ICIJ and its collabora-
tors were able to maintain the project’s security goals,
our study suggests several potential technical security
limitations in their approaches.
For example, while ICIJ focused heavily on preven-
tative security measures (e.g., ensuring encrypted com-
munications), systematic approaches to dealing with po-
tential security incidents seemed limited. While some
networking monitoring and logging was available for
network activity and document downloads, no system-
atic approaches to detecting or responding to potential
data exﬁltration events or other system breaches were de-
scribed by our interview participants. For example, the
discovery of an accidentally broadcast system URL was
handled in an apparently ad-hoc way.
We also observe a strong focus on communications
security (e.g., PGP) but less focus on endpoint secu-
rity. While ICIJ was in a position to mandate secu-
rity measures around communications, their inﬂuence on
endpoint and operational security was limited to occa-
sional training opportunities and “best practices” docu-
ments shared with contributors that addressed password
management, third-party tool use, use of new/unfamiliar
networks and basic threat modeling. They also rec-
ommended (and provided instructions for) creating en-
crypted hidden volumes for project documents stored lo-
cally. However, we do not know of any measures taken
to verify adherence to these guidelines by participants.
ICIJ may have deployed additional security measures
that we did not learn about in our interviews, but we high-
light these potential weaknesses to provide context for
the overall success of the project. We encourage future
system designers to take the lessons from this paper in
conjunction with existing security best practices.
4.4 Results Summary
In summary, we found that a large group of geographi-
cally and culturally diverse journalistswere able to col-
laborate securely over roughly a one-year period. To
achieve their security goals, they relied on established se-
curity mechanisms such as PGP and two-factor authen-
tication, as well as less systematized security practices
like a social-network approach to adding members.
Overall, our survey results suggest that participants
felt that complying with the security requirements of
these systems was relatively easy, in spite of the fact
that a large proportion of them had never used secu-
rity technologies including two-factor authentication and
PGP prior to the project. This is even more striking given
that the vast majority of participants reported using the
Blacklight and I-Hub systems daily in the 3 months prior
to the project launch, each of which required a separate,
two-factor login for every sign-on.
Our interviews, meanwhile, offer insight into both the
core system requirements of the Panama Papers project,
as well as the speciﬁc ways—such as strong HTTPS,
two-factor authentication, a PGP/encrypted email de-
fault, and centralized control of the documents—the
project’s security goals were met. Through secure de-
faults and strong trust relationships reinforced through
these collaborative systems, the limited security inci-
dents were well-tolerated and compromised none of
ICIJ’s major security goals for the project.
5 Discussion
We now step back and reﬂect on the contributing factors
to the Panama Papers project’s security success, and re-
ﬂect on how these factors may usefully inform the design
of secure journalistic collaborations, as well as usably se-
cure socio-technical systems more generally.

5.1 Factors for Success
Useful and necessary system functionality allowed for
security mandates. A key factor in the success of
ICIJ’s approach was that journalists found their systems
both useful and necessary, independent of their security
properties.
Journalists needed these systems for their
core functionality (i.e., access to the source documents
and collaboration with their peers), making strong secu-
rity requirements (such as two-factor authentication and
PGP) acceptable trade-offs to gain and maintain access.
ICIJ staff were aware of this dynamic:
You have to keep a balance between function-
ality and security. Because if you start with
all the good practices in security at once, jour-
nalists will react to that and they will resist it,
because it will be less functional. (IT2)
Our ﬁndings here align with research from man-
agement science, such as the Technology Acceptance
Model [15, 56, 57], which argues that successful technol-
ogy adoption in organizations depends not on mandated
compliance, but rather on (1) usefulness and (2) ease
of use. These factors a blend of both “social inﬂuence
processes” (e.g., working norm, voluntariness, and im-
age) and “cognitive instrumental processes” (e.g., job
relevance, output quality, perceived ease of use) [57].
Among these, however, “usefulness” (deﬁned as the
user’s perception that the new technology will enhance
their job performance and output) was found to be the
most powerful determinant of user acceptance.
Normalized security practices and secure defaults.
The Panama Papers project leads actively cultivated a
security-conscious culture in which secure communica-
tions were the norm. This norm helped project partic-
ipants avoid the need to make granular decisions about
which interactions warranted secure treatment. Several
of our interview participants clearly identiﬁed the value
of this approach. For example:
In this project we just routinely encrypted ev-
erything we wrote... Because we were just
used to doing it and that helped us a lot as a
team, that we understood that it’s not such a
big thing, it’s not such a pain in the ass—but
you’re always on the safe side of it. (E1)
By contrast, prior work [18] on email encryption adop-
tion in an activist organization identiﬁed issues around
encryption of non-sensitive messages. By universally en-
crypting all project-related communication, the Panama
Papers team avoided such social complexities.
Usable alternatives for secure communication min-
imized workarounds. The ICIJ’s systems supported
multiple forms of secure communication, giving users
ﬂexibility depending on their needs and task. For ex-
ample, I-Hub enabled secure group communication:
For colleagues who are not that experienced
with PGP or Signal or whatever...[the I-Hub is]
a good way to write secure emails or messages
to each other. (E1)
Where ICIJ systems didn’t meet a particular need,
however, contributors often reached for tools mandated
by ICIJ (e.g., PGP) or other secure alternatives, thanks
to the overarching security culture of the project, and the
familiarity with and trust in these tools that the project
provided:
I don’t like using PGP on the cell phone partic-
ularly. So then I would mostly switch to other
channels, like Signal. (E1)
System designers, meanwhile, were conscious of
users’ primary task objectives and strove to minimize the
friction of security security processes:
It had to be as secure as possible, and still al-
low working with it without doing a three-day
procedure to get into the I-Hub. (E1)
Cultivating mutual respect and reciprocity.
The
Panama Papers project systems were the product of an
iterative design process within a particular community
(journalists) and use case (i.e., facilitating global collab-
oration around a large trove of documents). This gave
the ICIJ team conﬁdence that the systems honored both
their needs and values as an organization, and those of
the journalist-contributors:
It’s great, it’s just software that is designed for
journalists. . . and that’s all we care about. (E2)
Panama Papers is the project where we tried to
apply all the lessons learned from the previous
projects. (E3)
ICIJ also maintained a careful balance between man-
dating security protocols and adding user-requested fea-
tures (e.g.
batch search), creating a sense of bal-
ance and equal partnership between the organization and
journalist-collaborators:
Once you have users, users will ask for things.
They’re helpful, you know? So, batch search-
ing feature, I did not plan that. But people
started asking “Would it be possible?” And it’s
like, “Ah, sure. This is a great idea.” (E3)
This culture of mutual interest and respect helped
users accept–and even support–ICIJ’s strong security re-
quirements.
Consultation with security experts. The ICIJ team
chose third-party services carefully, based on advice
from outside security experts:
USENIX Association
26th USENIX Security Symposium    515
In the beginning we talked a lot to security ex-
perts. We did not really tell them what we had,
of course not. But we needed to know more
about the whole issue and the [organization]
explained a lot about it worked... and why it’s
secure... So I know this seemed to make sense,
and we spoke to other experts and they said
“Yeah, you’re on the safe side with that.” (E1)
For example, while there were initial questions about
using cloud hosting, Amazon Cloud Services’ contract
promises to inform customers of government access re-
quests, allaying some fears:
Amazon has quite a good reputation when it
comes to ensuring the conﬁdentiality of the
customers...Their policy is to inform organiza-
tions if a state agency has requested a form or
information from them. (IT2)
Hushmail, on the other hand, was eventually aban-
doned due to uncertainty around its security properties:
I dont even know whether [Hushmail] has end-
to-end encryption.
It’s just completely...non-
transparent. It’s much better to use PGP. (IT1)
Although the technical security measures deployed by
the ICIJ were not necessarily complete, we note that they
were thoughtfully constructed. We encourage future sys-
tem designers to similarly engage security experts and/or
rely on current security best practices as much as possi-
ble during the design process.
Leveraging social relationships to build trust and
shared responsibility. Strong trust and social relation-
ships were integral to the Panama Papers’ collaboration
from the start: the initial group of contributers were all
ICIJ members, and becoming a member requires the ex-
plicit support of multiple existing members.
In addition to leveraging their strong ties with existing
members, actively cultivating a collaborative, trust-based
ecosystem among the non-ICIJ journalists helped secu-
rity practices permeate the otherwise disparate and phys-
ically disconnected group. In addition, frequent project
updates and security reminders from the ICIJ team–as
well as speciﬁc design elements of I-Hub–helped further
develop this sense of team and trust:
[On the I-Hub,] the small things, like the fact
that there’s an avatar and you can see the face
of the journalist, and you can have direct com-
munications and all that. . . it helps with trust.
It helps with bonding. (E2)
This observation echoes prior work [37] which found
that users make security decisions motivated in part by
a desire to maintain social work relationships. Indeed,
social pressure can nudge users towards security com-
pliance even if that compliance is burdensome or time
intensive [48]. Prior work [33] has also found that a high
rate of in-group communication fosters greater trust. Our
ﬁndings suggest that these factors all played in a role in
the security success of the Panama Papers project.
Sustained emphasis on security. Project leads at ICIJ
also clearly and frequently communicated the impor-
tance of security and what was at stake:
In every editorial note I would write, I would
remind [contributors] about some security
measure, how it takes one of us to make a mis-
take for the whole thing to basically fall to hell,
and you would lose an entire year of work, and
we would be—a joke basically. Nobody would
ever come to us again with any conﬁdential in-
formation. So, I would remind them so they
didn’t feel comfortable and too conﬁdent. (E2)
Organizational resource commitment. A key success
factor was the ICIJ’s willingness to commit resources to
developing useful and secure systems:
[Collaborating] requires a team, and it re-
quires systematic work. . . If there’s no com-
pelling need, journalists are not going to use
it. . . It has to be enforced also by the managers
and embraced by everyone. (E2)
Though stakeholders sometimes disagreed, develop-
ers actively sought management buy-in for creating long-
term security solutions. For example:
There is a tendency...
to have this kind of
quick solution and where it puts the load of the
problem onto staff. The solution my managers
proposed [for password reset issues].. created
a huge support burden... Selling [long-term
technical solutions] is a little difﬁcult to direc-
tors... But when you do implement it, it works
beautifully I think, and becomes an example to
other organizations. (IT2)
5.2 Lessons and Opportunities for Future Research
For the computer security research community,
this
case study represent a rare example of security success,
achieved despite many complicating factors. Examples
include: mandating important but notoriously inconve-
nient and/or hard to use protocols, like PGP [60]; con-
tributors’ lack of prior experience with the mandated
security practices; participants’ wide geographic dis-
tribution and diverse native languages. Yet ICIJ was
able to mandate their security requirements, and hun-
dreds of contributing journalists adhered to—and even
applauded—those requirements, allowing the project’s
security goals to be met. While the systems used in
the Panama Papers project are not appropriate for ev-
ery project, organization, or security scenario, we believe

this example offers important insights for those wishing
to design similarly effective systems, especially from a
human-centered perspective.
Lessons for Journalistic Collaborations. A key fac-
tor in the Panama Papers’ security success was the rep-
utation ICIJ had built for exclusive, high-impact investi-
gations. Journalists approached for the Panama Papers’
project were thus strongly incentivized to meet ICIJ’s
security requirements, which were required to gain ac-
cess to the systems and the documents they held. The
risk of being left out of future projects or ostracized
by colleagues and partner organizations made the cost
of security non-compliance particularly high. Similarly,
the importance of clear communication around security
suggests that tying security requirements to demonstra-
ble professional advantage, along with clear expectation-
setting (including negative consequences) are key factors
in motivating journalists to adopt and maintain even po-
tentially onerous security practices.
Recommendations for Socio-Technical Systems. Prior
work shows that employees will often sidestep secu-
rity requirements to focus on their primary tasks [24].
As the Panama Papers project demonstrates, however,
when security measures are integral to those tasks, they
may be better honored by users. This suggests that
