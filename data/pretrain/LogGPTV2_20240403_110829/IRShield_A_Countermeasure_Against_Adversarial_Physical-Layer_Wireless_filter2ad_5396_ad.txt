C. Impact of IRS
Next, we seek to further characterize the effect of varying
IRS parameters to provide a thorough guideline for practical
deployments. Therefore, we change conditions such as size,
distance, and orientation of the IRS w.r.t. an anchor device.
For experimental simplicity, we test these conditions without
considering human motion and leverage the strength of IRS-
induced channel variation as a proxy for the effectiveness of
channel obfuscation.
Effective IRS size. The IRS is passive w.r.t. RF signals, i. e.,
it only reﬂects but does not amplify signals. The physical size
of the IRS is an important factor which limits the reﬂected
signal power [30]. Thus, the IRS size is one parameter that
affects the effectiveness of IRShield. Studying this connection
experimentally, we vary the effective IRS size (since the
physical size of the IRS is ﬁxed) by simply deactivating a
certain number of IRS elements. Since IRShield is based on
time-varying surface conﬁgurations, the deactivated (static)
elements will not contribute to the channel variation.
In our experiment, we increase the number of active IRS
elements M from 32 to 256 in steps of 32 while we use
Algorithm 1 to generate IRS conﬁgurations. The IRS elements
to be added to the set of active elements are selected randomly.
For each effective surface size, we then record 2 min of
adversarial observations under channel obfuscation. We plot
the median, the 1st and 99th percentiles of the channel variation
together with the corresponding motion-detection threshold
according to [37] over the number of active IRS elements
in Fig. 11. We can see that the median and the threshold
grow with the effective IRS size. This conﬁrms our hypothesis
that an increasing number of varying IRS elements enhances
channel obfuscation. However, since the adversary’s motion-
detection threshold is already substantially increased for 64 ac-
tive elements, we conclude that IRShield does not necessarily
require large IRS deployments.
IRS distance. Next, we investigate the connection between
IRS-based channel obfuscation and the IRS distance to the
anchor device. Signal propagation including an IRS is typically
modeled by a multiplication of channels from the transmitter
to the IRS and from the IRS to the receiver [30]. Thus, due
to the inherent distance-dependent path loss of wireless radio

of the reference measurement being used as motion-detection
threshold. Thus, the detection rates were obtained with the
lowest threshold resulting in a false positive rate (FPR) of 0
(at least for the observed reference duration). The respective
heatmaps are shown in Appendix C (Fig. 22 and Fig. 23).
For anchor position 2, an adapted threshold would allow
the adversary to restore some detection capabilities. Regarding
the spatial aspects of this result, it can be seen from Fig. 22
and Fig. 23 in Appendix C that motion within the LOS
and directly adjacent to the anchor is still reliably detected.
This result is a vivid example for a limitation of IRS-based
channel obfuscation: Due to the ﬁnite size of the IRS, it
reﬂects a limited amount of signal power. Thus, it is chal-
lenging for the IRS to produce channel variations as strong
as LOS crossings. On the other hand, for anchor position 1,
the eavesdropper does not observe a signal with signiﬁcant
LOS coverage. This is reﬂected in Table II, showing that
the true positive rate (TPR) cannot be substantially increased
without also increasing the FPR. To illustrate the separability
of the eavesdropper’s observations without motion and with
motion, we plot
the receiver operating curves (ROCs) in
Fig. 10 for anchor position 2. The plots show the trade-off
between the TPR and FPR, essentially visualizing all possible
choices of detection thresholds. Especially for eavesdropper
position A, the detection approaches a random classiﬁer. This
result highlights that IRS-based channel obfuscation under
certain conditions provides near-ideal channel randomization,
thus thwarting adversarial motion detection.

test less optimal orientations by rotating the IRS around an
anchor device. For each IRS placement (at a constant distance
of 30 cm), the adversary records channel measurements for
1 min . Fig. 13 shows the median, the 1st and 99th percentiles
of the channel variation in a polar plot, where the angle
indicates the IRS placement. For 0°, the IRS faces towards
the eavesdropper. As expected, we can see that the channel
obfuscation works best when the IRS is roughly directed
towards the eavesdropper. Thus, when the environment to be
protected has limited public accessibility (e. g., a hallway on
one side of the property such as in Fig. 3), the defender should
point the IRS towards this direction. However, despite that,
even in the worst case where the IRS points in the opposite
direction of the eavesdropper, the channel obfuscation is still
effective, albeit with reduced impact.
Data throughput. Another important question is whether
IRShield affects the wireless data throughput. Previous coun-
termeasures, e. g., [37] and [29], affect the allocation of the
transmission medium and therefore face a trade-off between
the quality of service of wireless communication and reduction
of adversarial sensing capabilities. To this end, we emphasize
that our channel obfuscation approach is based on changing the
transmission medium itself instead of its allocation. Therefore,
we expect the channel obfuscation to have a marginal effect
on the data throughput.
We put
this claim to test by measuring packet error
rates (PERs) of a Wi-Fi connection with and without the
channel obfuscation being active. For this, we deploy two
legitimate IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi devices in the eavesdropper’s
target area and make one device transmit 200,000 packets
while the other keeps track of the received packets. For
the transmissions, we randomize the payload data and use
a ﬁxed modulation and coding scheme (MCS) [27]. In this
experiment, we use 2 × 2 MIMO devices which calls for
using MCS values 8-15 (two spatial streams). We place the
IRS next to the transmitter.

channels, the received power from the IRS will be inversely
proportional to the inverse squared product of the distances
to and from the IRS [21]. That is, the IRS works best near
the transmitter or receiver (since one of the IRS distances
is minimized). However, speciﬁc to our channel obfuscation
application for, e. g., living spaces, it is reasonable to assume
that the IRS is located rather close to both anchor devices and
the receiver (the eavesdropper).
To assess this experimentally, we vary the distance of
the IRS to anchor 2. For each distance, the eavesdropper
observes the wireless channel from position A for 3 min . We
plot the median, the 1st and 99th percentiles of the channel
variation and the corresponding motion-detection threshold
according to [37] over IRS distances between 15 and 150 cm
in Fig. 12. As expected, the channel obfuscation works best
when the IRS is close to the anchor. Please note that the IRS
generally can operate from higher distances as well, however,

IRS orientation. Despite the distance, another relevant aspect
of IRS placement is its orientation w.r.t. the eavesdropper. In
the previous experiments, we placed the IRS facing towards
the eavesdropper, i. e., the front of the IRS pointed towards
the left side of the target area shown in Fig. 3. As this place-
ment presumably is optimal for the defender, we additionally

We
considered the
threshold-based motion detection
from [37]. Here, long-term channel observations are used to
ﬁnd the detection threshold, assuming that the target area typi-
cally does not exhibit motion. For our experimental evaluation,
other than in a realistic attack scenario, we granted the eaves-
dropper dedicated and well-behaved reference measurements
without any movement in the target area.

cases. As higher MCS settings correspond to higher data rate
transmissions with less immunity against noise, this indicates
channel conditions with a limited signal-to-noise ratio. Apart
from that, the key observation is that the channel obfuscation
appears to cause only a negligible increase or decrease in PER.
This is because our randomized IRS conﬁguration approach
will certainly both improve and degrade the wireless channel
over time. Thus, as indicated by our experimental result, we
believe that the average channel quality is not affected by
channel obfuscation.
VI. DISCUSSION
In the following, we discuss the experimental setup, our
results and provide directions for future research.
A. Experimental Setup and Results
As our main goal was the evaluation of IRS-based chan-
nel obfuscation, we made some simpliﬁcations to the attack
realization in order to facilitate experimentation. Notably, we
thereby granted the adversary rather optimal conditions, which
naturally is desirable for evaluation of a countermeasure.
First, we deployed a set of MIMO-capable Wi-Fi routers
