User: I wrote an application that stores several things in the registry. When I first started, I added them to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, but kept getting permission errors writing to the. So, it was suggested that I use HKEY_CURRENT_USER, that worked until I realized that I am not able to access them from another account. How can I write to the registry but allow all accounts to access read and write to it?
I used the Python module _winreg.
Assistant: You'll either need admin permissions to write to HKLM, or settle for non-global reg keys. Behavior is going to vary somewhat between different versions of windows.
