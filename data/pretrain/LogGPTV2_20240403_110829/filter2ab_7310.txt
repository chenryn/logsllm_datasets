To mitigate the impact of a previously generated golden ticket, it is recommended to reset the built-in KRBTGT account password twice. This process will invalidate any existing golden tickets created using the KRBTGT hash, as well as other Kerberos tickets derived from it.

For each domain, follow these steps:
1. Change the KRBTGT account password.
2. Force replication to ensure the change is propagated across all domain controllers.
3. Change the KRBTGT account password a second time.

Additionally, consider rotating the KRBTGT account password every 180 days to further enhance security.
