If it's a hardware defect further problems are to be expected. If it's a software problem certain types of error and alarm conditions may be left undetected.  Copy the error message exactly as it appears and report it to your technical support representative.\" The interrupt handlers for some of the interrupt sources are installed while IOS boots. Some do not get installed by the eboot image which does not initialize the FP card nor the line cards. Interrupts from those sources are supposed to be masked off until the interrupt handlers are installed.  Two things went wrong to cause this error: 1. We got an interrupt from a source which is not supposed to generate interrupts at  this time. 2. This type of interrupt is not supposed to be  enabled at this time. The first issue can be caused by  malfunctioning hardware and also by buggy software which  initializes a piece of hardware to early. The second issue is caused by software."
