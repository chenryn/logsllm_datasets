This bug is present in Bootstrap's docs:
http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#modals
  1. Launch the demo modal
  2. Close the modal
  3. Open the same modal again
  4. The x button at the top and the close button at the bottom don't work
Clicking outside still works and pressing the escape key still works, so this
appears to be isolated to elements that use data-dismiss="modal".
Tested in Chrome 28.0.1500.95 and Safari 6.0.5.
