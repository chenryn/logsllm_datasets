### Title: Breaking the Isolation: Cross-Account AWS Vulnerabilities

**Abstract:**

A new class of cross-account vulnerabilities has been identified in multiple AWS services, allowing attackers to manipulate these services and perform unauthorized actions on other clients' resources. These vulnerabilities arise from unsafe identity policies used by AWS services to access client resources. The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in three major AWS services: AWS Config, CloudTrail, and the Serverless Repository. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could enable an attacker to read and write certain objects in private S3 buckets.

In this presentation, we will:
- Review the discovered vulnerabilities and their root causes.
- Demonstrate how an attacker can exploit these services to perform actions on any AWS account via the identified cross-account vulnerabilities.
- Discuss the broader implications, as this new class of vulnerabilities may affect many other AWS services due to the implicit tenant scope defined in IAM policies.

**Key Findings:**
- **Vulnerable Services:** AWS Config, CloudTrail, and the Serverless Repository.
- **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized read and write access to private S3 buckets.
- **Root Cause:** Unsafe identity policies and implicit tenant scope in IAM policies.

**Challenges in Remediation:**
- **Sub-Optimal Update Process:** While AWS acted quickly to address the reported issues, the responsibility for updating IAM policies often falls on customers, who may not always do so.
- **Lack of Tracking and Tools:** IAM vulnerabilities are not tracked by NIST, do not have CVEs, and lack dedicated scanning tools. This results in most customers running with vulnerable IAM policies without a clear process for remediation.
- **High Volume of Updates:** AWS frequently issues security updates to its IAM policies, but security teams lack the necessary tools to scan for and prioritize these updates.

**Mitigations and Recommendations:**
- We will review the specific mitigations provided for the IAM vulnerabilities we discovered.
- We will also discuss the current gaps in the vulnerability management process for IAM and propose ways to improve it.
- It is crucial to raise awareness within the community about the importance of addressing IAM-related vulnerabilities, as they represent a significant attack surface in cloud environments.

By understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, organizations can better protect their AWS resources and enhance the overall security of their cloud infrastructure.
