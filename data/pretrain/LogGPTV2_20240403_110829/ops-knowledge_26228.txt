User: Please write a Python program to realize the function of searching and replacing in text according to keywords.
Assistant: Here is an example program to replace "hello" in text with "world": ```python text = """hello Python world! hello programming world!""" keyword = "hello" replacement = "world " new_text = text.replace(keyword, replacement) print(new_text) ``` The output is: ``` world Python world! world programming world! ``` Explanation: - The `text` variable contains the text to be replaced. - The `keyword` variable contains the keyword to look for. - The `replacement` variable contains the new content to be replaced. - Replace all `keyword` with `replacement` by calling the `replace()` method of the string, and store the result in the `new_text` variable. - Finally, output the new text to the console.
