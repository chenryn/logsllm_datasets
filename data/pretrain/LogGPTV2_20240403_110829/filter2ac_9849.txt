ABSTRACT
Traceroute is probably the most famous computer networks diag-
nostic tool, widely adopted for both performance troubleshooting
and research. Unfortunately, traceroute is not free of inaccuracies.
In this poster, we present our ongoing work to address the inac-
curacy caused by third-party addresses. We discuss the impact of
third-party addresses on traceroute applications and present a novel
active probing technique able to identify such addresses in tracer-
oute traces. Finally, we detail preliminary results suggesting how
this phenomenon has been largely underestimated.

1. MOTIVATION AND SUMMARY
In the last decade many research works have used traceroute (or
its variants) to infer network topological properties [5,8], and, more
in general, in active monitoring approaches for anomaly detection,
performance analysis, and geolocation. Traceroute is known to be
affected by several inaccuracies that can produce errors or wrong
assumptions when using its results to infer other information [7]:
third-party (TP) addresses have been pointed out as an uncommon
case mostly appearing at the border of multi-homed Autonomous
Systems (ASes) [6].
To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of TP addresses
in IP paths has not been properly quantiﬁed and we believe that its
impact has been largely underestimated. In this poster, to shed light
on this topic, we propose a novel active probing technique based
on the IP prespeciﬁed timestamp option: it allows to directly detect
the presence of TP addresses in traceroute IP paths. We present
a preliminary analysis conducted on about 13 K traceroute traces
collected from a single vantage point. The analysis conﬁrms the
potentiality of our technique and unveils an unexpected amount of
TP addresses. Finally, by performing IP-to-AS mapping on our
dataset, we quantify the amount of potentially fake AS links due to
TP addresses.

2. TP ADDRESSES AND THEIR IMPACT
The RFC1812 [2] states that the source address of an ICMP re-
ply packet should correspond to the outgoing interface of the reply,
rather than the interface on which the packet triggering the reply
was received. This behavior can cause a traceroute IP path to in-
clude addresses associated to interfaces not included in the actual
traversed path. Let’s see an example (Fig. 1): in the trace from S to
D containing the sequence (a, b, c) of IP addresses (hereafter IPs),
where a and b represent the incoming interfaces of routers A and B
respectively, and c is the interface used by router C to send ICMP
replies to the traceroute originator, the last IP is a TP address (be-
ing associated - in this speciﬁc trace - to an interface not effectively
traversed by packets from S to D).
The occurrence of TP addresses can have a signiﬁcant impact
on some traceroute applications. A ﬁrst example are the issues oc-
curring when mapping traced IP addresses to AS numbers, in or-
der to discover AS level links. In this case, as shown in previous
works [6], TP addresses may cause the inference of false AS links.
Considering again Fig. 1: if the IP address associated to interface b
belongs to ASx, and the one associated to c belongs to the ASz ad-
dressing space, then the traceroute conversion will produce a false
AS link, i.e. ASx − ASz. Another example is related to the iden-
tiﬁcation of the subnets traversed by packets along the path toward
a destination, as performed by the Tracenet tool [10]: the presence
of TP addresses forces the tool to exploit several heuristics to state
if a detected subnet is actually on the traversed path.
3. PROPOSED APPROACH
Our approach exploits the IP prespeciﬁed Timestamp (TS) op-
tion to identify TP addresses. The TS option allows to prespecify
in a single packet up to four IP addresses from which a timestamp
is requested. When processing this option, most devices insert their
own timestamp only if the packet passes through the interface as-

sociated to the prespeciﬁed address [4]. Suppose IPx owned by one
of these devices and belonging to a traceroute path. In order to un-
derstand if IPx is a TP address, we target the traceroute destination
with an UDP probe1 equipped with a TS option, in which IPx is
prespeciﬁed four times: if the TS option brought back into the pay-
load of the ICMP PORT UNREACH message contains at least one
timestamp, according to the behavior described above, IPx belongs
to the actual IP path2, otherwise IPx is a TP address. To be able
to distinguish between routers reporting a TP address and ones not
implementing the TS option, after collecting a traceroute path, we
ﬁrst directly probe each discovered hop IPy with an ICMP ECHO
REQUEST message in which IPy is prespeciﬁed: this step allows to
identify the set of IP addresses classiﬁable by our approach. The
proposed approach would allow to avoid complex heuristics for
subnet positioning in Tracenet [10] and to take into account path
ﬂuctuations affecting the Palmtree [9] alias resolution technique.
4. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
To evaluate the proposed approach, we randomly selected 50 K
destinations among the ones showing stable responsiveness accord-
ing to the PREDICT project [1]. About 13 K destinations replied to
UDP probes carrying the TS option. Focusing our attention on this
subset, we launched a traceroute campaign, from our laboratory at
University of Napoli, collecting a ﬁnal dataset of 32 K IPs. Fig.
2(a) shows the percentage of hops classiﬁable in each trace: all the
hops resulted classiﬁable in 26% of traces. In general, the proposed
approach showed a promising level of applicability: on average and
in the worst case, we were able to classify 80% and 38% of hops
per trace, respectively. Furthermore, it classiﬁed 2.5 K IPs (7.8%)
as TP addresses in at least one trace. Such value appears surpris-
ingly high, suggesting that TP addresses are not so uncommon as
previously hypothesized [6]. Fig. 2(b) compares, for each trace,
the number of addresses classiﬁed as TP or associated to incoming
interfaces (IN) and shows how in 324 traces (2.43% of the total)
we found more TP addresses than IN IPs.
As shown in Fig. 3, a single TP address may affect several traces.
The two most common TP addresses appeared respectively in 7.3 K
and 5.2 K traces, essentially because they were located close to the
vantage point: on average, a TP address appeared in 7.8 traces.
Finally, mapping each address to the owner AS [3], we found
that our dataset covers 1.9 K distinct ASes. By considering two
consecutive hops in a traceroute trace mapped to distinct ASes as a
potential AS link, we extracted about 2 K AS links. Among these,
527 (26%) involved TP addresses, thus being potential source of
1UDP probes allow to avoid ambiguities caused by the reverse path.
2In this case, IPx is probably associated to an incoming interface.

inaccuracies according to the scenario depicted in Fig. 1. Although
not necessarily all these links were false, such high percentage sug-
gests that TP addresses may represent a signiﬁcant cause of AS
maps distortion. Our approach allows to identify the subset of links
to carefully consider when the objective is to draw the AS level map
exploiting the information obtained with traceroute.
5. ONGOING AND FUTURE WORK
This analysis represents a ﬁrst snapshot of an ongoing research
work. We are extending our study in different ways: (i) adopting
different probes to obtain a wider support; (ii) using a larger dataset,
to better evaluate the applicability of our technique; (iii) exploiting
multiple vantage points, to detect when IPs act as incoming and
TP addresses. (iv) deepening the TP addresses impact on AS level
topology exploiting ground truth. We plan to implement and re-
lease to the research community a modiﬁed traceroute version able
to automatically discover the IP path and label IPs as TP address.
