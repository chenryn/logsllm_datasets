TICP Peer Review, the SOPs are not standardized throughout the UA.  Additionally, the UA has not 
identified a specific time to provide training on the SOPs.  In regards to command and control practices, the 
UA has implemented the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) 
more than 6 months ago across all disciplines.  This short time frame for implementation could be the reason 
that the UA demonstrated some deficiencies in following the NIMS/ICS practices (e.g., the designation of a 
Communications Unit Leader did not occur until later in the exercise) during its exercise.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Standardize regional policies, practices, and procedures that can be agreed upon throughout the 
participating jurisdictions 
• 
Ensure regional SOPs for command and control are NIMS/ICS-compliant  
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

While multi-agency communications within a jurisdiction occur daily on the UA’s shared systems, 
Dallas/Fort Worth officials reported that multijurisdictional/multicounty interoperability (i.e., when an 
agency leaves its home system) has been a challenge.  As indicated in the After Action Report, there was a 
lack of local and regional designated interoperability talk groups during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., 
Arlington Police Department and Arlington Fire Department used different command channels since there 
was no talk groups designated for the use of unified command).  In general, interoperable communications 
should be regularly exercised to better identify and address potential gaps, as were identified in the TICP 
validation exercise, which showed both technical and procedural issues with providing a coordinated 
response.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure the correct interoperability channels are programmed into gateways and radio channel 
programming documentation is available (as recommended in the After Action Report as well) 
• 
Continue to regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability 
resources to improve proficiency in their application 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The large UA uses very high frequencies (VHF) with both analog and Project 25 (P25)-compliant radio systems, ultra 
high frequencies for the City of Dallas, and the 800 megahertz (MHz) band with both M/A-COM and Motorola 800 
MHz trunked equipment being employed.  There are also several 800 MHz conventional mutual aid channels.  The 
Department of Justice has implemented a two-channel interoperability system consisting of two repeaters—one in 
Dallas and one in Fort Worth—which are VHF P25 compatible.  In addition, many gateways and consoles are available 
for patching communications resources in the UA.  
Because of frequency limitations in the Dallas/Fort Worth UA, not many changes can be made to interoperable 
communications in the UA at this time.  Eventually, the NCT COG would like to see the expansion of TICP to 
surrounding counties and smaller jurisdictions, specifically at schools and universities, hospitals, and secondary public 
safety answering points.  The NCT COG hopes to create more mutual aid talk groups on the Fort Worth 800 MHz 
trunked system to be used with Tarrant and Denton counties and possibly to be implemented during the upcoming 
rebanding of the 800 MHz public safety spectrum.

The Houston Urban Area Working Group Executive Committee established the Regional Interoperable 
Communications Committee (RICC).  The RICC has both technical and operations working groups and 
advises the Executive Committee on interoperable communications issues.  Houston officials indicated that 
the RICC is formalized; however, decision-making authority in the governance structure is not clearly 
defined in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  Houston officials note that agreements 
governing communications interoperability among agencies exist (e.g., memoranda of understanding, 
channel plans), but it appears that many of these partnerships are informal and not documented.  Strategic 
planning is particularly critical for the Houston UA as the region upgrades its 800 megahertz (MHz) system 
and the City migrates its current system to a 700 MHz.  The region indicates that monthly meetings are held 
to coordinate this migration and to develop a broader strategic plan.  However, such a plan has not yet been 
published.  In some cases, individual jurisdiction leadership has made interoperability a funding priority (as 
suggested by the City of Houston’s approval of the initial 25 percent of the cost of its new radio system).  
However, other jurisdictions appear to have been less successful in developing and pursuing long-term 
funding strategies beyond grant programs.  This issue would be best addressed by developing a strategic plan 
that includes a longer term funding strategy to obtain diversified and sustainable funding for regionwide 
interoperable communications solutions. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Establish a formal charter to clarify roles and responsibilities for all local, state, and federal participants 
in the governance structure and expand the decision-making group’s role to focus on communications 
interoperability policy and operations 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., participate in statewide efforts in developing memoranda of 
understanding) among all participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability 
• 
Dedicate an individual within the UAWG RICC to manage and update agreements in place 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts by continuing the development and documentation of a 
strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) for approval, acceptance, and adoption by all 
participating agencies to ensure that regionwide interoperability needs are met 
• 
Establish interagency communications as a requirement for new systems in the area through a 
regionwide strategic plan 
• 
Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) interoperability planning 
and sustainable funding beyond only allocating resources for individual systems 
• 
Champion a governance structure that would more fully support a regional strategic plan 
• 
Involve senior government leadership broadly across the UA in interoperability and encourage long-term 
(e.g., 3 to 5 years) regional funding plans

The TICP provides the first formal regional communications SOPs for the Houston UA.  Prior to the 
development of the TICP, the UA had informal SOPs among jurisdictions, but the documentation reviewed 
does not indicate whether the informal SOPs were specifically for regional interoperable communications.  
The UA has taken steps, including participation in the TICP Implementation Workshop, to distribute these 
newly established policies.  In regards to command and control procedures, the Houston UA has 
implemented the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) as the 
official incident response protocol through an executive order.  Additionally, the UA has ensured that 
mandated training and certification is completed.  Exercise evaluators indicated that the UA fully 
demonstrated the use of NIMS/ICS by properly implementing the communications unit and Communications 
Unit Leader position SOPs. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Document and distribute regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP), and put 
them into practice through regular training (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses), 
exercises, and daily usage  
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

Multi-agency communications in the Houston UA is primarily provided through two major shared systems 
(Harris County 800 megahertz [MHz] and City of Houston ultra high frequency [UHF]).  Because of the 
systems’ disparate bands, communications personnel regularly and proficiently use a permanent fixed 
gateway to link the systems.  In carrying out the TICP validation exercise, the Houston UA showed effective 
command and line-level communications across multiple jurisdictions and disciplines.  The UA listed 
numerous state and federal agencies in the TICP that were not present during the TICP validation exercise, 
the exclusion of which limited the demonstration of effective interoperability solutions among agencies at all 
levels of government.  Including broader levels of government and public support disciplines would help 
ensure increased familiarity of interoperability resources across all response agencies. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to include interoperability as a component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities 
• 
Consider including additional state and federal agencies (e.g., Customs and Border Protection, U.S. 
Secret Service) in future exercises and day-to-day use

The UA identified two shared systems in the area, with the Harris County 800 MHz system supporting the most users.  
The City of Houston operates on a large, conventional, UHF system and routinely communicates with other agencies on 
different radio systems.  Several mobile gateways and many channels can be connected via console patches, and radio 
caches are available in the area for interoperability.  The Harris County 800 MHz system is beginning an upgrade to a 
Project 25 700/800 MHz integrated voice and data system.  The current system is more than 16 years old and must be 
replaced.  The City reviewed several options for the current UHF system and is presently in the preliminary planning 
stages for its migration to 700 MHz.

The San Antonio Urban Area Working Group (SUAWG) was established in October 2005 and has a formalized 
communications subcommittee.  The UA reports a mix of formal and informal partnerships among the public safety 
organizations in the area, including a regional mutual aid agreement that involves 71 agencies and the U.S. Department 
of the Army.  The San Antonio UA is developing a strategic plan for interoperable communications; however, planning 
efforts that were initialized in 2004 have yet to yield a strategic plan acceptable to area first responders.  The UA 
established a shared system before receiving Urban Area Security Initiative funds and has given some consideration to 
regional interoperability needs through Department of Homeland Security grant funding.  The UA noted that agencies 
within the UA develop and maintain their own budget and procure communications interoperability equipment with 
consideration for regional interoperable communications.  The documentation does not note, however, whether there is 
a regionwide plan to budget for interoperable communications.  It would be beneficial for the UA to develop a longer 
term funding strategic plan to identify diversified and sustainable funding for recurring and lifecycle costs.  San Antonio 
officials indicated that the field leaders in SUAWG have been directly involved in providing support for 
communications interoperability efforts; involvement of senior executive leadership in the UA is not evident from 
available documentation. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider distributing a formal charter to all participating agencies to clarify roles and responsibilities for all local, 
state, and federal participants in the governance structure  
• 
Establish processes to develop and review agreements (e.g., usage agreements, memoranda of understanding) at 
least every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or upgrades to ensure the agreements are up-to-date and 
consistent with current needs  
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the Tactical 
Interoperable Communications Plan [TICP]) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance that takes into 
account a long-term communications funding strategy (in addition to grants) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Identify long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding for communications interoperability in addition to grants 
•

The San Antonio UA incorporated existing communications interoperability policies, practices, and procedures into the 
TICP.  The UA has taken some steps to distribute and provide training on the SOPs (e.g., distributed through the TICP 
Implementation Workshop, made applicable SOPs available with radio caches and gateways) to most of the public 
safety organizations in the area; however, the UA did not report directly providing the SOPs to participating TICP 
agencies and dispatch centers.  Despite having pre-existing SOPs distributed and participating agencies trained on their 
use, participants experienced some procedural problems (e.g., missing radio cache battery chargers, patching problems, 
initial command identification confusion) during the TICP validation exercise.  The San Antonio UA implemented the

National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) within the last year.  Although the 
UA’s NIMS/ICS implementation efforts are not yet well established, it is evident that considerable effort is being made 
to attain NIMS compliance.  The State of Texas mandated further NIMS/ICS training in 2005, and most of the first 
responder community has already participated.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure that the TICP is updated and aligned with regional communications interoperability SOPs (e.g., include a 
backup plan for gateway/console patch equipment, review operational talk groups that should be included as shared 
talk groups) 
• 
Develop and distribute regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) and put them into 
practice through regular training (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses), exercises, and usage

The San Antonio UA demonstrated some ability to use available communications interoperability solutions.  For 
example, the After Action Report indicated that the radio cache worked satisfactorily during the TICP validation 
exercise and was used for most participating agencies that did not otherwise have access to the 800 megahertz (MHz) 
radios that could communicate on the primary shared system.  A remote incident command vehicle was also used 
effectively during the TICP validation exercise.  Although the UA reported frequent use of shared channels, gateways, 
and shared systems, the TICP validation exercise highlighted some of the deficiencies in San Antonio UA’s first 
responders’ ability to adequately demonstrate the proper implementation of available interoperability solutions.  
Examples of these deficiencies include the inability of participants to effectively connect two systems through a shared 
channel, a console patch failure causing an interruption in communications, and radio cache maintenance and battery 
management issues.  In addition, the UA used a console patch to connect two systems instead of using shared channels 
identified in the TICP.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., shared channels, gateways) to 
improve proficiency in their use 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The San Antonio UA has two major 800 MHz M/A-COM Enhanced Digital Access Communications System trunked 
systems.  The City of San Antonio and Bexar County share one system, and the counties of Bexar, Guadalupe, and 
Comal share the Live Oak Police Department system.  Other local agencies use very high frequency systems, and many 
public works agencies use the Lower Colorado River Authority 900 MHz system, which covers many counties.  Many 
interoperability gateways are available in the UA that can be used for interoperable communications.  The SUAWG is 
working to develop improved communication methods and procedures to improve interoperable communications with 
the military.  Currently, the military has at least two dissimilar communication systems that are not connected to local 
shared systems.  Previous incidents requiring interoperable communications among military and non-military agencies 
have required use of cached radios and/or deployment of mobile gateways.

Governance for regional communications in Seattle is overseen by the Tri-County Voice Communications 
Interoperability Oversight Committee.  The committee appears to be operating well and is formalized, but it 
is not clear that authorities and responsibilities have been established (through a charter) or that the 
committee has direct multijurisdictional representation from users beyond system operators.  Partnerships 
among agencies are provided through a mix of informal and formal agreements, and a strategic plan for 
regional interoperability (beyond the operational focus of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan 
[TICP]) has not been developed.  Through an Urban Area Security Initiative grant, some regional 
consideration has been given to regionwide communications interoperability needs (e.g., procurement of a 
communications vehicle used in the area), as well as long-term planning for grant funding.  While this 
planning for the use of grants is beneficial, it does not address the need to diversify sustainable funding 
sources to provide for recurring and lifecycle costs.  Developing a strategic plan for interoperable 
communications will require strong leadership.  From the available documentation, it is unclear to what 
extent local government leaders in the area are involved in supporting communications interoperability 
politically or fiscally. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Establish a formal charter to clarify roles and responsibilities for all local, state, and federal participants
