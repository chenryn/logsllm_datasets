**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote Data Storage

To mitigate the risk of adversaries locating and manipulating data on local systems, automatically forward email data and events to a centralized log server or data repository. When feasible, minimize the time delay in event reporting to reduce the duration that data is stored locally. This approach helps ensure that sensitive information is protected and reduces the window of opportunity for potential tampering.
