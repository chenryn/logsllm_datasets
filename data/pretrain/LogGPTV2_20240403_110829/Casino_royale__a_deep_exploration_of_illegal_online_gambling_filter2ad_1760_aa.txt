ABSTRACT
The popularity of online gambling could bring negative social
impact, and many countries ban or restrict online gambling.
Taking China for example, online gambling violates Chinese
laws and hence is illegal. However, illegal online gambling
websites are still thriving despite strict restrictions, since
they are able to make tremendous illicit profits by trapping
and cheating online players. In this paper, we conduct the
first deep analysis on illegal online gambling targeting Chi-
nese to unveil its profit chain. After successfully identifying
more than 967,954 suspicious illegal gambling websites, we
inspect these illegal gambling websites from five aspects,
including webpage structure similarity, SEO (Search Engine
Optimization) methods, the abuse of Internet infrastructure,
third-party online payment, and gambling group. Then we
conduct a measurement study on the profit chain of illegal on-
line gambling, investigating the upstream and downstream
of these illegal gambling websites. We mainly focus on pro-
motion strategies, third-party online payment, the abuse of

1 INTRODUCTION
Online gambling has been thriving in the last two decades,
and it has become one of the most popular and lucrative
businesses on the Internet. However, its thriving popularity
brings negative impacts and unprecedented challenges for
regulations. The problem could be further exacerbated due to
its high-speed instant gratification and high level of privacy
offered, as well as the abuse of trust in legal payment systems,
resulting in pathological gambling. Moreover, the largely
unsupervised electronic fund transfers of online gambling
can be easily exploited by criminals to launder significant
amounts of money.
The legal status of online gambling varies from different
countries and regions around the world. Although online
gambling is legal in most of European Union countries and
several nations in the Caribbean, there are still many coun-
tries that restrict or ban online gambling. Illegal online gam-
bling websites are those that target users living in gambling
prohibited countries. Taking China for example, according to
Chinese laws, operating online gambling websites or proxies
is not permitted. However, there are a spate of online gam-
bling websites targeting Chinese via various kinds of illegal
advertisements [12]. Most of these illegal online gambling
websites are operated outside of China (e.g., Philippines) be-
cause of restrictive laws in China [7]. Moreover, abusing
the support from legal third-party online payment channels
makes illegal online gambling websites more trustworthy
and hence attracting more players.
In this paper, we attempt to answer the following two
questions: (1) how do miscreants operate illegal gambling
websites? and (2) with different roles in operating gambling
websites, how are they orchestrated? To this end, we conduct
an empirical study on illegal gambling websites that target
Chinese. We first develop a detection system to identify il-
legal gambling websites with the help of unlimited query
interface of Baidu’s search engine [5], and we successfully
identify 967,954 illegal gambling websites. Then we exam-
ine the identified illegal gambling websites and investigate
how migrants operate these gambling websites, including
their promotion strategies, payment systems, and customer
service applications.
Findings. We disclose the following strategies on which
miscreants operate illegal gambling sites.
(1) Abuse of online payment. We find that illegal gam-
bling websites stealthily employ legitimate online payment
channels for their illegal transactions. This is due to the boost
of online third-party payment systems, including Alipay [3]
and WeChat Pay [35] in China. Although these popular third-
party online payment systems have no intention to provide
financial support for gambling business in China, there are
still many malicious financial proxies that can abuse these
online payment systems to support their illegal services. Ac-
tually we find that more than 322 small online third-party
payment companies that provide illegal financial services
and support transactions for online gambling websites by
abusing normal Alipay and WeChat Pay channels.
(2) Abuse of outsourcing live chat services. We notice
that most gambling websites prefer to outsource live chat
services, instead of running their owns. In total, we find 8,387
abused outsourcing live chat services, and the most abused
one is Provider Support [25], a typical outsourcing customer
service provider. By outsourcing customer services, illegal
gambling websites can enhance their credibility and attract
more victims.
(3) Abuse of third-party cloud storage. The third-party
cloud storage services are widely abused for hosting web
resources of illegal gambling websites, especially images and
videos. We find that a number of illegal gambling websites
host their images in image hosting services like Sinaimg (http:
//www.sinaimg.cn/) and Alicdn (http://www.alicdn.com/).
Our observation shows that online third-party storage
providers can serve as a pinch point for detecting illegal
gambling websites while being abused by illegal gambling
websites.
(4) Promotion strategies. Illegal Gambling websites can-
not promote their websites by using traditional SEO (Search
Engine Optimization) methods due to their illegitimacy. Our
work reveals three promoting strategies for illegal gambling
websites, including gambling navigation1, porn websites, and
blackhat SEO. We further disclose several options on how
illegal gambling websites conduct blackhat SEO and attract
potential victims.
Contributions. We summarize our major contributions of
this work as follows:
• A systematic analysis of online illegal gambling cate-
gories, their promotion strategies, and their network
infrastructures. This can help us to understand how
operators control a mass of illegal online gambling
websites.
• The first measurement on the abuse of online third-
party payment, outsourcing live chat services, and
third-party cloud storage services by illegal gambling
websites,
• The first measurement on promotion strategies em-
ployed by illegal gambling websites. The disclosure of
their promotion strategies will help the security com-
munity to seek a more effective method to detect these
websites.
Roadmap. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we present the background and motivation
for our research. In Section 3, we detail the system archi-
tecture and detection methods we used. In Section 4, we
describe our measurement study on gambling websites. In
Section 5, we present two case studies about payment change
and withdrawal in gambling websites, showing how they
evade detection and cheat users. In Section 6, we survey
related work. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude the paper.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we present an overview of illegal online gam-
bling business, including how an illegal online gmabling
1Gambling websites link to each other.
However, for illegal websites (e.g., contents about drugs
and arms purchase and sale), they cannot reach good rank-
ing in search result pages because their content is forbidden
in certain countries and regions. So, illegal websites abuse
whitehat SEO methods to manipulate search results deliber-
ately by keyword stuffing, cloaking, and many others. This
is called blackhat SEO.
Keyword stuffing is first presented in [22]. Its key fea-
ture is to fill keywords in all corners of a webpage, even in
invisible parts (e.g., meta tag’s content, page element with
invisible property or beyond user visual scope). Cloaking is
another method for blackhat SEO proposed in [15]. It utilizes
the difference between a normal user’s web browser and a
search engine crawler, and presents two different contents
accordingly. It can cheat a search engine to gain high page
ranking for a malicious website.
2.3 Online Payment.
The ultimate goal of a gambling website is to make profit. So
online payment plays an important role in online gambling.
In general, players can make payment or withdraw on gam-
bling websites at any time via online payment. Unlike using
credit cards and online banking [11], players in China prefer
to use third-party online payment like Alipay or WeChat pay.
These two payment systems have occupied more than 92%
market shares of online payment in China [24]. Through-
out this paper, “online payment” is interchangeable with
“third-party online payment".
To complete a transaction via online payment, there are
11 main steps: (1) A user applies for a bank card (regardless
of credit card or debit card). (2) The user registers an online
payment account, and binds to the credit cards or debit cards.
(3) A merchant registers an online payment account, binds to
the company’s banking account and applies for a third-party
payment service. (4) The third-party payment provider gives
merchant ID, payment gateway URL, public Key, private key,
and signature method to the merchant if the merchant’s ap-
plication is approved after auditing. (5) The merchant sets
up a website for business. (6) When users make payment,
the merchant will send requests to the third-party online
payment gateway with parameters of total payment amount,
merchant ID, return URL, notification URL, and other infor-
mation. (7) The payment gateway generates payment URL
and gives the merchant the URL in forms of a QR Code. (8)
The merchant exhibits the QR Code to users. (9) Users scan
the QR Code with online payment application and make the
payment to the online payment provider. (10) The online pay-
ment provider checks the payment amount requested and
received. If correct, it informs the merchant with a positive
response. All messages to the merchant are hashed with the
signature method and the signature is encrypted with the

website operates, blackhat SEO, and illegal online payment.
We further give a detailed description on how online pay-
ment works.
2.1 How an Illegal Online Gambling
Website Operates.
Figure 1 shows an example of illegal gambling websites that
target Chinese players. There are three main steps for a
gambling website to gain profit: (1) advertising, (2) visiting,
and (3) making payment.
For the first step, due to the fact that online gambling is
forbidden in some countries and regions, gambling websites
cannot conduct legal SEO to appear in the top of search re-
sults. However, illegal gambling sites are capable of utilizing
blackhat SEO for promoting their websites and attracting
players. In [8], Du et al. found a new method for blackhat
SEO called “spider pool”, and most of promotion contents are
associated with illegal gambling websites. Players who want
to gamble can visit a gambling website through hyperlinks
in blackhat SEO pages. If they are interested in the types
of gambling in the site, they can make payments and play.
Figure 2 illustrates the procedure of online gambling based
on a customer’s visiting path.
2.2 Blackhat SEO.
SEO is an appointment between website and search engine,
assisting search engine algorithms to extract useful informa-
tion from a webpage quickly and accurately. Search engine
manufactures announce their SEO white paper [14] for en-
couraging its legal use, which is called whitehat SEO.

merchant’s public key. (11) When the merchant receives pay-
ment messages, it checks the signature with the merchant’s
private key. If correct, it further checks the payment amount
with the payment requested. If they match, the payment
process is finished.
However, in China there are three unique features in on-
line payment. (1) Third-party online payment like Alipay
or WeChat pay has been very prevalent in China, while on-
line banking remains the dominant method for making pay-
ment. These online payment methods are usually provided
by IM (Instant Messaging) chat tools like AliWangWang and
WeChat. Benefiting from the prevalent use of IM chat tools,
online payment has been thriving in China.
(2) For Alipay and WeChat pay, these two are not tra-
ditional banking and their businesses are not restrictively
supervised. So, these two online third payment channels can
provide payment services to other merchants and manufac-
tures without restrictive auditing.
(3) There are more than 100 online payment channels
that are built on the top of these two main payment chan-
nels. To attract more customers, they lower the bar for their
customers’ auditing. Therefore, miscreants can easily abuse
these online payment channels to conduct malicious activi-
ties.
3 ANALYZING ILLEGAL GAMBLING
WEBSITES
In this section, we describe the dataset and methodology
that we use for the in-depth analysis of illegal gambling
websites and auxiliary modules, including promotion mod-
ule and online payment module. Illegal gambling websites
and auxiliary modules work together like an industry chain.
We also present an overview of illegal online gambling and
provide a detailed inspection on auxiliary modules.
3.1 Overview
Figure 3 summarizes our analysis methodology. First, we
start with a set of URLs provided by Baidu search engine,
and crawl the webpage of each URL. Second, we build a
content based classifier to distinguish gambling webpages
from others. Then, after the detection phase, we analyze the
webpages that are used to promote these gambling websites.
Forth, we analyze the content of gambling webpages to count
the game types that involve in. Finally, we extract the online
payment channels, outsourcing live chat services, and image
storage services used by gambling websites.
3.2 Illegal Gambling Detection
The first challenge of our work is to detect illegal gambling
websites. There are two major concerns here: the accuracy
of detecting illegal gambling pages and how to obtain the
dataset of webpages used for detection and ensure its diver-
sity (i.e., representativeness).
We obtain 50,000 illegal gambling webpages and 50,000
normal webpages that are verified by Baidu, which serve as
the ground truth for our detection (labeled as datatr aininд).
To ensure the diversity of webpages, we cooperate with Baidu
(the largest search engine in China), who provides 10 million
URLs indexed by their crawlers, and we crawl the HTML
content of each URL. We label the dataset as datatotal.
We build an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to
group different types of webpages (gambling and the others)
based on datatr aininд. The procedure is shown in Figure 4.
We read raw HTML content from all webpages and extract
Figure 3: System Architecture.
text from various HTML tags. The HTML tags used here
are , , , , , , and .
We select these tags because they play a more important
role in the ranking of search engines than others [28]. With
the text extracted from webpages, we first tag the text and
remove the stopwords while retaining the verbs and nouns.
Then we calculate the information gain and chi-square of
each word, and retaining the top 20,000 words of these two
features. Finally, we concatenate the left words to a new
sentence. Each sentence is converted to vector by the TF-
IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method.
Using these vectors for testing in the next step. We then adopt
10-fold cross validation. In each fold, the dataset is split into
training/testing sets with a ratio of 80/20. Our SVM classifier
can achieve 99.99% of accuracy and 96.1% of precision-recall
ratio.
With our classifier, we inspect these 10 million URLs in
datatotal, which include various TLDs (Top Level Domains,
e.g. .com, .cn, .pw, .xyz, and .info). We deploy our classifier
in a workstation with 12 cores E5 CPU and 128GB memory.
As a result, 967,954 suspected illegal gambling webpages are
identified. We label these as Sitesдamble. Due to the limit
of ground truth, we manually check some parts of these re-
sults. We randomly select 2,000 pages from suspected illegal
gambling webpages and inspect their content manually. We
confirm that 1,997 of them are indeed illegal gambling pages.
We examine the three falsely identified webpages and find
that all of them have few content, and hence we cannot treat
them as illegal gambling websites affirmatively.
3.3 Promotion Strategy
We further investigate the strategies on how these illegal
gambling websites promote themselves to appear in search
results. We collect 106,430,755 URLs from Baidu with hyper-
links pointing to illegal gambling sites, referred to as the

upstream of illegal gambling sites. It is reasonable to assume
that if a website points to a target site, it promotes the target
