Global Communication Guarantees
in the Presence of Adversaries

ABSTRACT
DDoS attacks have been plaguing the Internet for over 20 years. For
every defense mechanism invented, attackers find a new way to
circumvent it. Is it possible to fundamentally prevent DDoS attacks
and achieve global communication guarantees? Since the Internet is
a public resource, what does it even mean to prevent DDoS – since
the adversary can also claim to be communicating “legitimately.”
In this talk we will unravel the different forms of DDoS attacks
by first discussing how to construct meaningful definitions, and
second showing how to achieve communication guarantees. This
talk then demonstrates how global communication guarantees can
be achieved in the SCION secure Internet architecture [1–3].

1 BACKGROUND
SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-Generation Net-
works) is the first clean-slate Internet architecture designed to fun-
damentally solve many security issues of today’s Internet through
route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for
end-to-end communication [1–3]. A core concept of SCION are
its isolation domains (ISDs), which organize multiple autonomous
systems (ASes) into independent routing planes and substantially
increase both scalability and security properties of the network: On
the one hand, ISDs enable a separation of the routing protocol into
an intra-ISD and an inter-ISD process, which reduces the overall
complexity—similar to the separation if the Internet into ASes or
a division of an AS into areas by existing intra-domain routing
protocols (e.g., OSPF and IS-IS). On the other hand, by isolating

the routing process within an ISD from all external actions, ISDs
limit the effect of misconfigurations and routing attacks. Further-
more, all routing messages are authenticated based on a secure
but flexible public-key infrastructure (PKI) in which each ISD can
independently define its own roots of trust. This allows network
entities to select which ISD’s trust roots they want to rely upon for
verification and rules out global kill switches, which do exist in sev-
eral of today’s PKIs (e.g., DNSSEC and RPKI). As a result, the SCION
architecture provides strong resilience and security properties as
an intrinsic consequence of its design.
In contrast to today’s Internet, where all routing decisions are
taken by the network nodes, SCION also provides path transparency
and control to end hosts: End hosts learn about available network
path segments, combine them into end-to-end paths according to
their own preferences, and embed the corresponding forwarding
information into the packet headers. In addition to allowing end
hosts to influence the path of their packets and circumvent un-
trusted ASes, this packet-carried forwarding state enables a robust
and efficient forwarding process, as routers no longer need to store
large forwarding tables in expensive content-addressable memory.
Thanks to embedded cryptographic mechanisms, path construction
is constrained to the route policies of Internet service providers
(ISPs) and receivers, thus offering path choice to all network entities:
senders, receivers, and ISPs. In addition, SCION’s path awareness
directly enables multi-path communication, which is an important
approach for high availability, rapid failover in case of network fail-
ures, increased end-to-end bandwidth, dynamic traffic optimization,
and resilience to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
SCION is an inter-domain Internet architecture and thus does not
restrict the internal infrastructure and networking protocols of ISPs
and other ASes. This substantially facilitates SCION’s deployment,
as only the border routers of an AS need to be upgraded while all
other network infrastructure can be reused. SCION has been devel-
oped since 2009 and since August 2017, it has been in production
use by a large Swiss bank, where several branches are connected to
the data center exclusively over the SCION network. To date, the
native (BGP-free) SCION network spans 7 ISPs (all offering SCION
connections to customers) and 2 continents and is in production
use by several Swiss banks and the Swiss government, in addition
to several blue-chip companies.
The SCION secure Internet architecture provides several fea-
tures that enable not only high security for communication, but
also higher performance than traditional Internet approaches. In
particular, SCION’s symmetric key derivation system enables high-
speed packet authentication at routers and firewalls at less than 100
ns on commodity hardware. The Path Aware Networking (PAN)
concept empowers end hosts to obtain information about end-to-
end network paths and select the path for each packet, enabling
multi-path communication which can further speed up communi-
cation.

group. He is also a Distinguished Fellow at CyLab, and an Adjunct
Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mel-
lon University. From 2002 to 2012, he was a Professor of Electrical
and Computer Engineering, Engineering and Public Policy, and
Computer Science (courtesy) at Carnegie Mellon University, be-
coming Full Professor in 2009. From 2007 to 2012, he served as the
technical director for Carnegie Mellon’s Cybersecurity Laboratory
(CyLab). He earned his MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science
from Carnegie Mellon University, and spent three years during his
PhD at the University of California at Berkeley. He received his
BSc degree in Computer Engineering from EPFL. Adrian’s research
revolves around building secure systems – in particular his group
is working on the SCION secure Internet architecture.
He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award in 2004, IBM faculty
fellowships in 2004 and 2005, the Sloan research fellowship in 2006,
