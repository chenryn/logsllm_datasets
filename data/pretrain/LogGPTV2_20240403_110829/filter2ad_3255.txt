# Global Communication Guarantees in the Presence of Adversaries

## Abstract
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have been a persistent threat to the Internet for over two decades. Despite numerous defense mechanisms, attackers continue to find new ways to circumvent them. This raises the question: is it possible to fundamentally prevent DDoS attacks and ensure global communication guarantees? Given that the Internet is a public resource, what does it mean to prevent DDoS when an adversary can claim to be communicating "legitimately"?

In this talk, we will explore the various forms of DDoS attacks by first defining meaningful terms and then demonstrating how to achieve communication guarantees. We will also show how global communication guarantees can be achieved within the SCION secure Internet architecture [1–3].

## 1. Background
SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-Generation Networks) is a clean-slate Internet architecture designed to address many of the security issues in today’s Internet through route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communication [1–3]. A key feature of SCION is its isolation domains (ISDs), which organize multiple autonomous systems (ASes) into independent routing planes, enhancing both scalability and security.

On one hand, ISDs separate the routing protocol into intra-ISD and inter-ISD processes, reducing overall complexity. This is similar to the separation of the Internet into ASes or the division of an AS into areas by existing intra-domain routing protocols (e.g., OSPF and IS-IS). On the other hand, by isolating the routing process within an ISD from external actions, ISDs limit the impact of misconfigurations and routing attacks. All routing messages are authenticated using a secure and flexible public-key infrastructure (PKI), where each ISD can independently define its own roots of trust. This allows network entities to choose which ISD’s trust roots they want to rely upon for verification, thereby eliminating global kill switches, which are present in several current PKIs (e.g., DNSSEC and RPKI).

In contrast to the traditional Internet, where all routing decisions are made by network nodes, SCION provides path transparency and control to end hosts. End hosts learn about available network path segments, combine them into end-to-end paths according to their preferences, and embed the corresponding forwarding information into packet headers. This not only allows end hosts to influence the path of their packets and avoid untrusted ASes but also enables a robust and efficient forwarding process, as routers no longer need to store large forwarding tables in expensive content-addressable memory.

Embedded cryptographic mechanisms ensure that path construction adheres to the route policies of Internet service providers (ISPs) and receivers, offering path choice to all network entities: senders, receivers, and ISPs. Additionally, SCION’s path awareness directly supports multi-path communication, which is crucial for high availability, rapid failover in case of network failures, increased end-to-end bandwidth, dynamic traffic optimization, and resilience to DDoS attacks.

SCION is an inter-domain Internet architecture and does not restrict the internal infrastructure and networking protocols of ISPs and other ASes. This facilitates SCION’s deployment, as only the border routers of an AS need to be upgraded while the rest of the network infrastructure can be reused. Since 2009, SCION has been in development, and since August 2017, it has been in production use by a large Swiss bank, connecting several branches to the data center exclusively over the SCION network. Currently, the native (BGP-free) SCION network spans 7 ISPs (all offering SCION connections to customers) and 2 continents, and is in production use by several Swiss banks, the Swiss government, and several blue-chip companies.

The SCION secure Internet architecture offers features that not only enhance communication security but also improve performance compared to traditional Internet approaches. Specifically, SCION’s symmetric key derivation system enables high-speed packet authentication at routers and firewalls with less than 100 ns latency on commodity hardware. The Path Aware Networking (PAN) concept allows end hosts to obtain information about end-to-end network paths and select the path for each packet, enabling multi-path communication and further speeding up communication.
