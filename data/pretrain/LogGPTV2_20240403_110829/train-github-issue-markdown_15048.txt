### Current Behavior
`npm i --save ...` removes related peer dependency.
### Expected Behavior
`npm i --save ...` does not remove peer dependencies.
### Steps To Reproduce
Existing package.json:
      "dependencies": {
        "@my-org/my-pkg": "^1.0.0"
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "@my-org/my-pkg": "^1.0.0",
        "some-other-pkg": "^2.3.4"
      }
Running `npm i --save @my-org/my-pkg@1.0.1` results in the following
package.json:
      "dependencies": {
        "@my-org/my-pkg": "^1.0.1"
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "some-other-pkg": "^2.3.4"
      }
Note that the peer dependency `"@my-org/my-pkg": "^1.0.1"` was removed during
install.
