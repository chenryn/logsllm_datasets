Big / Unstructured Data
The huge data volumes that today’s enterprises are generating, along with a proliferation of new kinds
of data from social media, mobile, web, and machine sources, have prompted the development of a
new class of so-called Big Data management solutions and capabilities. Data stored in large volumes is
typically stored in an unstructured fashion for later analysis. Relational database vendors have developed
capabilities for supporting large volumes of unstructured data within the database as well as adaptors for
connecting to other Big Data solutions to enable data integration.

Management
Many enterprises have large database deployments often into the hundreds and beyond. DBAs require
tools for maintaining these data farms easily and quickly and for performing operations in bulk across
multiple databases. Customizable graphical consoles with a full compliment of features for monitoring,
tuning, managing, and alerting are paramount to DBAs performing the basics of their responsibilities.
Management encompasses both the capabilities within the database that support the DBA in their
operational tasks and tools external to the database as well.

APPENDIX A:
Data Encryption Options
The following data encryption options offer different levels and granularity of protection depending on
the needs of the application.
Using pgcrypto Using DBMS_CRYPTO
Postgres contrib module Oracle compatible wrapper around pgcrypto
with same features and limitations
Applied to selected table columns
Supports multiple cipher algorithms
Cannot search or index encrypted fields
DES, 3DES, AES and AES128
Encryption must be applied at table creation,
so advance planning is required MD4, MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions
The application must handle the encryption/ Generate cryptographically strong random values
decryption so that exchanges with the
database remain encrypted
DBAs cannot see data in clear
Using Disk Partition Encryption Using File System Level
File system disk partition is encrypted/ Individual files or directories are encrypted by
decrypted by the OS the file system
Protects all files in the database partition Requires file-based key management
including temporary files
Individual management of encrypted files
Data is decrypted when read from the (e.g. incremental backups) even in
filesystem. This allows DBAs to see encrypted form
the data – so have roles and permissions
Access control can be enforced by use of
locked down
public-key cryptography
Transparent to application developers
Cryptographic keys are only held in memory
e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux supports while the file that is decrypted by them is
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) held open
Transparent to application developers
e.g. eCryptfs for Linux (http://ecryptfs.org/)

APPENDIX B:
EDB Postgres Advanced Server
Compatible Package Support
EDB focuses on the most popular functions within packages. Hence for some packages not all Oracle
functions may be supported. For specific details refer to the Database Compatibility for Oracle®
Developer’s Guide
Package Name Package Description
DBMS_ALERT Functions that allow asynchronous notification of database events via an Alert.
Using this package and triggers, an application can notify itself whenever values of
interest in the database are changed.
DBMS_AQ Advanced queueing provides database-integrated message queueing so that
business applications can communicate with each other whereby a producer
application enqueues messages and a consumer application dequeues messages.
DBMS_CRYPTO Provides functions to encrypt and decrypt stored data.
DBMS_JOB Has been replaced by DBMS_SCHEDULER but included for compatibility with older
Oracle applications.
DBMS_LOB Functions that allow access to and manipulation of Large Object values.
DBMS_LOCK Provides a function interface to Lock Management services.
DBMS_OUTPUT Allows the sending of messages from stored procedures, packages, and triggers for
application or debugging use.
DBMS_PIPE Functions that allow two or more sessions in the same database instance to
communicate with one another.
DBMS_PROFILER Provides functions to profile stored procedure workloads and identify
performance bottlenecks.
DBMS_SCHEDULER Job scheduler functions for creating and executing unattended repetitive tasks
inside the database.
DBMS_SQL Permits the use of dynamic SQL in procedures to allow applications
to run SQL statements with unknown parameters (such as table name) until runtime.
DBMS_RANDOM Useful functions to generate random text, numeric and date values.

from seeing each other’s data in the same application.
DBMS_SESSION Functions with the ability to enable and disable roles.
DBMS_UTLTITY A collection of functions for getting information about various runtime
operations and meta data from the database.
UTL_ENCODE Functions to perform Base64 encoding and decoding of data intended
for transport between hosts.
UTL_FILE Allows database procedures to read and write operating system text files
in an I/O stream fashion.
UTL_HTTP Functions that provide the ability to make HTTP calls to access
information on web servers.
UTL_MAIL Provides functions to create, manage, and send email from the database
including attachments, CC, and BCC.
UTL_RAW Functions supporting the manipulation of raw data types.
UTL_SMTP Provides functions for sending mail via SMTP according to the RFC821
specification.
UTL_URL Functions for escaping and “un-escaping” URL strings.
