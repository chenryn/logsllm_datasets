ternative resolvers do not provide the related support. An
example is EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) request, which
allows a DNS query to include the address where it orig-
inates, thus different responses can be returned according
to the location of clients. However, by checking the 205
alternative resolvers that are open, we ﬁnd that only 45
(22%) accept ECS requests.
7 Mitigation Discussion
At present, almost all DNS packets are sent unencrypted,
which makes them vulnerable to snooping and manip-
ulation. This problem has already been noticed by the
DNS community, and RFC7858 [39], which describes
the speciﬁcation of DNS over Transport Layer Security
(TLS), is released to address this problem. Unfortu-
nately, the deployment of DNS over TLS is sophisticated
and needs changes from the client side. As such, the wide
deployment of this initiative could take a long time.
Based on our observation, we developed an on-
line checking tool [25] to help Internet users detect
DNSIntercept. This tool works with the help of the
authoritative nameservers operated by ourselves. A user
visiting our checking website will issue a DNS request
to our domain, and the request is captured by our au-
thoritative nameserver. By comparing the resolvers that
contact our nameservers to their designated ones, In-
ternet users are able to identify DNSIntercept. Cur-
rently, we are still perfecting this website, aiming at pro-
viding more information of DNSIntercept for Internet
users. However, current solutions and mitigations are far
from enough. The security community needs to pro-
pose new solutions that can address the issues around
DNSIntercept.
8 Related Work
Rogue DNS resolvers. Adversaries can build DNS re-
solvers which return rogue responses for DNS lookups,
which can arbitrarily manipulate trafﬁc from users. Pre-
vious studies showed that motivations include malware
distribution, censorship, and ad injection [38,42]. In this
paper, we study another type of DNS trafﬁc manipula-
tion.
Transparent DNS proxies. Transparent DNS proxies
could manipulate DNS trafﬁc that goes through. Firstly,
network operators could monetize from through redi-
recting DNS-lookup error trafﬁc to advertisements [55,
56]. Similarly, Chung et al. leveraged the residential
proxy network to study violations of end-to-end trans-
parency on local DNS servers, their results showing 4.8%
NXDOMAIN responses are rewritten with ad server ad-
dresses [36]. Furthermore, previous studies presented
that 18% DNS sessions of cellular network go through
transparent DNS proxies [53] and time-to-live values
(TTL) are treated differently [49]. In addition, technical
blogs have reported that it is possible for Internet Ser-
vice Providers to hijack DNS trafﬁc using DNS transpar-
ent proxies [1, 13, 17, 18]. By contrast, our study focuses
on the on-path hidden interception behavior, instead of
rogue resolvers or DNS proxies.
Internet censorship. The DNS protocol lacks authen-
tication and integrity check, hence DNS trafﬁc manip-
ulation has become a prevalent mechanism of censor-
ship, blocking users from accessing certain websites.
Signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to studying the
whats, hows, and whys of censorship in both global
and country-speciﬁc views. Results showed many coun-
tries have deployed DNS censorship capabilities, include
China, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran and Syria [28,29,30,31,32,
44,45,58]. Also, from a global view, Pearce et al. discov-
ered widespread DNS manipulation [48], and Scott et al.
found DNS hijacking in 117 countries [50]. By contrast,
the domain names used in our study are exclusively reg-
istered and used, and we avoid any sensitive keyword.
Therefore, our study does not overlap with censorship
mechanism.
Other manipulation of Internet resources. Moreover,
researches have discovered other ways to manipulate
DNS trafﬁc, including abusing the DNS namespace (i.e.,
“Name Collision” [34, 35]), exploiting conﬁguration er-
rors and hardware issues (typosquatting [47] and bit-
squatting [54]), and “Ghost domains” [40]. As the clos-
est work to ours, Allman et al. presented how to detect
unauthorized DNS root servers [27]. However, only one
type of trafﬁc manipulation was considered, with only
limited cases being discovered. Our study serves as a
complement to these existing works in understanding the
security issues in DNS ecosystem.
Compared to previous researches, our work gives a
systematic and large-scale research on DNSIntercept, a
class of DNS behavior that has not yet been well-studied,
and highlights issues around security, privacy, and per-
formance.
9 Conclusions
In this paper, we present a large-scale study on
DNSIntercept, which brings to light security, pri-
vacy and performance issues around it. We develop
a suite of techniques to detect this kind of hidden be-
havior, leveraging two unique platforms with numer-
ous vantage points. Based on our dataset, we ﬁnd that
DNSIntercept exists in some ASes and networks. In
addition, interception characteristics as well as motiva-
tions of DNSIntercept are further analyzed. Our results
indicate that the hidden DNSIntercept can potentially
