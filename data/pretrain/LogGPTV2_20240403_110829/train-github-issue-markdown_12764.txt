### Issue Type:
Bug Report

### Ansible Version:
1.6.3

### Environment:
Ubuntu 14.04

### Summary:
When using the `apache2_module` module to enable `mpm_prefork`, a change is reported during each playbook run, even though the module is already enabled.

### Steps to Reproduce:
```yaml
- name: Ensure mpm_prefork is enabled
  apache2_module:
    name: mpm_prefork
```

### Expected Results:
No change should be reported during the playbook run if `mpm_prefork` is already enabled.

### Actual Results:
A change is reported during each playbook run, even though `mpm_prefork` is already enabled. The output is as follows:

```sh
# a2enmod mpm_prefork
Considering conflict mpm_event for mpm_prefork:
Considering conflict mpm_worker for mpm_prefork:
Considering conflict mpm_itk for mpm_prefork:
Module mpm_prefork already enabled
```

This indicates that the module is being re-enabled unnecessarily, causing the playbook to report a change.
