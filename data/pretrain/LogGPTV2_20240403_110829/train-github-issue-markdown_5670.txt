I would like to reopen ticket #1035. Below is the information I previously submitted:

#### Issue Description
The `crackfortran` patch does not appear to be redundant, as it allows for setting the Python callback argument as optional. I use this feature by adding the following f2py declarations to the Fortran file where the Python callback is called:

```fortran
! These lines are here to get the correct settings into flip.pyf
cf2py  intent(callback, hide) py_errmsg
cf2py  optional py_errmsg
cf2py  external py_errmsg
cf2py  use gp_errmsg__user__routines
```

Here, `py_errmsg` is a Python callback function.

#### Problem Without the Patch
Without the patch, I encounter the following error message from Python when attempting to execute the Fortran subroutine that contains the Python callback:

```
TypeError: flip.gp_setdef() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)
```

In this case, `gp_setdef` is the Fortran subroutine called from Python and contains the f2py lines mentioned above.

#### Current Status
I have tested this with NumPy version 1.3, and the patch is still required. If there is an alternative method to achieve the same functionality without the patch and without requiring the Python callback function as an argument, I would appreciate knowing how to do so. The user base for our software is growing, and the necessity of applying the patch for each installation is becoming unmanageable.

#### Updated Patch
I have updated the attached `crackfortran.patch` file for NumPy 1.3.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
