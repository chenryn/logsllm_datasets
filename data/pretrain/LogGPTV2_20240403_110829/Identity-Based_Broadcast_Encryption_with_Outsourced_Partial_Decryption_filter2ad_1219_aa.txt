Abstract. Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) is an eﬀective
method to protect the data security and privacy in multi-receiver scenar-
ios, which can make broadcast encryption more practical. This paper fur-
ther expands the study of scalable revocation methodology in the setting
of IBBE, where a key authority releases a key update material periodi-
cally in such a way that only non-revoked users can update their decryp-
tion keys. Following the binary tree data structure approach, a concrete
instantiation of revocable IBBE scheme is proposed using asymmetric
pairings of prime order bilinear groups. Moreover, this scheme can with-
stand decryption key exposure, which is proven to be semi-adaptively
secure under chosen plaintext attacks in the standard model by reduc-
tion to static complexity assumptions. In particular, the proposed scheme
is very eﬃcient both in terms of computation costs and communication
bandwidth, as the ciphertext size is constant, regardless of the number
of recipients. To demonstrate the practicality, it is further implemented
in Charm, a framework for rapid prototyping of cryptographic primitives.

Introduction
Broadcast encryption (BE), ﬁrst introduced by Fiat and Naor [13], is a cryp-
tographic paradigm that enables delivering encrypted content over a broadcast
channel in a way that only qualiﬁed users are able to decrypt the content. For a
BE in the public key setting, there is a dealer which is empolyed to generate and
distribute decryption keys for users. A sender can encrypt to a set of receivers by
choosing their public keys adaptively, and the encrypted data can be decrypted
only by the user with the private key in the set of receivers. A BE scheme is
collusion resistant if no information about the encrypted data is leaked, even if
all users that are not qualiﬁed collude. BE has a wide range of applications such
as pay-TV, encrypted ﬁle systems and digital right management.
Identity-based encryption (IBE) is an advanced form of public key encryption
in which the public key of a user is some unique information about the identity of
the user (e.g., a user’s IP or email address). Moreover, as public keys are derived
from identiﬁers, IBE scheme eliminates the need for a public key infrastructure
(PKI). In the IBE system, a trusted third party called the private key generator
(PKG) can generate the corresponding secret keys associated with each user’s
public identities. A sender who has access to the public parameters of the system
can encrypt a message using the receiver’s identity as the public key, and only
the intended receiver who obtains its decryption key from PKG can decrypt.
Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) can be seen as a natural gen-
eralization of IBE, i.e., BE in the identity-based setting, which recognizes the
users in a BE scheme with their identities, instead of indexes assigned by the
system. The number of valid identities in the IBBE scheme can be exponential
with the security parameter, while the number of public keys in the public key
broadcast setting is only polynomial with the security parameter. IBBE is an
eﬀective method to protect the data security and privacy in multi-receiver sce-
narios. In an IBBE scheme, a sender can broadcast an encrypted message to any
set of intended users, which is called privileged set. If the size of the privileged
set is 1, the resulting IBBE scheme would be an IBE scheme obviously. For the
trivial solution to construct an IBBE scheme which encrypts the message once
for each identity using an IBE scheme, the resulting ciphertext would be linear
in the privileged set, which is ineﬃcient especially for a large set of receivers.
In 2007, Delerabl´ee [11] presented the ﬁrst IBBE scheme with constant size
ciphertext, though it is only weak selective-ID secure in the random oracle model.
This construction makes use of the hybrid encryption paradigm: key encapsula-
tion mechanism (KEM) and data encapsulation mechanism (DEM) framework
where the broadcast ciphertext only encrypts a short symmetric key used to
encrypt the long messages, which is also adopted by most BE schemes. Very
recently, Ramanna [31] proposed a novel IBBE scheme with constant size ci-
phertext that can achieve adaptive security in the standard model.
One desirable functionality of multi-user cryptosystems is the support for
membership revocation. For example, malicious users should be driven out im-
mediately from the system, and even for the honest users should be revoked if
their private keys get stolen or lost. Key revocation is well studied in BE such
as [28,19]. However, realizing eﬃcient user revocation mechanism in the IBE
setting turned out to be very challenging. Compared with traditional public key
encryption in the PKI setting, IBE simpliﬁes the key management problem by
avoiding public key certiﬁcates. Therefore, users cannot be easily revoked by
digital certiﬁcates and certiﬁcate revocation lists. As a result, the key revocation
problem in IBE is not as simple as in tradition PKI setting.
The ﬁrst practical IBE scheme, proposed by Boneh and Franklin [5] from
the Weil pairing, also suggested a straightforward revocation method for IBE
schemes: dividing the lifetime of the system into discrete time periods and re-
freshing the private key for non-revoked users periodically. Unfortunately, this
approach is not scalable and very ineﬃcient because all non-revoked users should
2
update their private keys via a secure channel, and the workload on the PKG
grows linearly in the number of non-revoked users. To address this problem,
Boldyreva et al. [6] proposed a scalable revocable IBE (RIBE) scheme which
employed the tree based revocation techniques from [28] to reduce the PKG’s
workload to only logarithmic (instead of linear) in the number of users. Moreover,
each non-revoked user can derive a decryption key from the public update key,
while revoked users cannot compute their decryption keys. There is no secure
channel that is required for non-revoked users to update their private keys.
After the work of Boldyreva et al. [6], Seo and Emura [33] introduced a new
security notion called decryption key exposure resistance (DKER), which can
better capture the the realistic threat of IBE system. Generally speaking, this
security deﬁnition can guarantee that the conﬁdentiality of ciphertexts is not
compromised even if a user’s decryption key at some periods has been exposed.
Though DKER seems to be a natural security notion, Seo and Emura have
proved that Boldyreva et al.’s RIBE scheme is vulnerable against decryption key
exposure. Using Boldyreva et al.’s revocation methodology, Seo and Emura [33]
also proposed the ﬁrst RIBE scheme that is adaptive secure with DKER, which
has become the default security requirements for RIBE scheme. Since then, a
lot of followup works of RIBE schemes with DKER have been proposed. Among
them, the most recently scheme by Watanabe et al. [38] based on the modiﬁed
Jutla-Roy IBE scheme [16] is the ﬁrst adaptively secure RIBE scheme with
DKER that can achieve short public parameters in prime order groups.
As the set of qualiﬁed users can change in each broadcast emission, eﬃcient
revocation of individual users or user groups is the primary objective of broadcast
encryption. For the IBBE scheme, which is a natural generalization of BE in
the identity-based setting, however, there is still no provably secure scalable
revocation methodology has been proposed so far, even in Boldyreva et al.’s
security model. Motivated by this, we further expand the study of revocable
IBBE (RIBBE). We mainly focus on the construction of RIBBE scheme with
DKER. In particular, we would like to have a construction that has constant size
ciphertexts, which is more eﬃcient and less bandwidth consuming compared with
schemes of ciphertexts that are linear in the set of receivers.
Our Contribution In this paper, we propose a novel construction of re-
vocable IBBE scheme with constant size ciphertexts. To prove its security with
DKER, we ﬁrst deﬁne the syntax of revocable IBBE scheme using KEM-DEM
paradigm and its security model, which takes into account the realistic threat
of decryption key exposure for the scenario of IBBE. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst construction of revocable IBBE with provable security.
Speciﬁcally, our revocable IBBE scheme has the following merits.
1. Our scheme is a KEM which can produce a symmetric key along with a
header, thus long messages can be encrypted under the short symmetric key.
For simplicity, we only discuss the header size in the KEM, which is constant
in our construction, regardless of the number of underlying receivers, which is
very eﬃcient both in the communication overheads and computational costs.
Furthermore, only 4 group elements together with a tag are needed in the
3
ciphertexts header of our revocable IBBE scheme, which can be comparable
to the revocable IBE scheme in [38]. Moreover, we implement it in Charm
framework [3], more details of which can be deferred to Section 6.
2. The public parameters in our scheme is linear in the maximum size of the
privileged identities set: m, which is predetermined and ﬁxed in the setup
phase. The private key for each user is linear in the value of m∗log2N , where
the maximal value of system users N is also a predetermined value in the
setup phase of the revocable IBBE system.
3. Our scheme also follows Boldyreval et al.’s revocation methodology [6] with
the binary-tree data structure approach, which reduces the amount of work
in key update from linear to logarithmic complexity in the maximal number
of system users N . For each time period, the PKG will broadcast update key
information through a public channel, which is useless for already revoked
users. Only the non-revoked user can combine the update key and his private
key to derive a decryption key that can be used to decrypt proper ciphertexts.
More precisely, according to [33], the size of update key is O(rlog2(N/r)) if
r (cid:54) N/2, or O(N − r) if r > N/2, where r is the number of revoked users.
4. Our construction is built upon prime order bilinear groups of Type-3 pair-
ings under mild variants of the Symmetric eXternal Diﬃe-Hellman (SXDH)
assumption: the Augmented Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on G1 (ADDH1) and
Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on G2 (DDH2). Note that ADDH1 assumption
is ﬁrst deﬁned by Watanabe et al. in [38], which is proved in the generic
bilinear group model.
5. With regard to the security, our revocable IBBE scheme is semi-adaptively
secure with DKER under chosen plaintext attacks. Semi-adaptive securi-
ty, ﬁrst proposed by Chen and Wee [10], is a notion of security that lies
between selective and adaptive security for functional encryption systems.
More particularly, if we set the maximum size of receivers m to be m = 1,
the resulting revocable IBBE scheme is a revocable IBE system, which can
achieve adaptive security with DKER.
At a high level, our design approach is very similar to the Seo and Emura’s
technique of transforming IBE to RIBE in [33,38]. Firstly, there should be a basic
IBE scheme that satisﬁes the requirement of (1) the secret key re-randomization
property and (2) applicability of Boneh-Boyen technique [4]. Then, an adaptive-
ly secure RIBE scheme with DKER is constructed by applying the Seo-Emura
technique. Similarly, we also employ a basic IBBE scheme and the Boneh-Boyen
IBE scheme [4] as the building blocks. To achieve short ciphertexts and fast
decryption, the basic IBBE is derived from the most recently proposed IBBE
scheme of Ramanna [31], with necessary modiﬁcations mainly for the public pa-
rameters part to achieve the secret key re-randomization property. The security
of the revocable IBBE scheme with DKER can be reduced to the adaptive secu-
rity of the basic IBBE scheme. We note that it is not a trivial work to construct
a revocable IBBE with adaptive security even given a revocable IBE scheme.
The primary challenge in the security proof is how to simulate decryption keys
for identities of the privileged recipients. While there is only one target identity
4
in the setting of RIBE, there will be multiple private keys and decryption keys
that can be used to decrypt the challenge ciphertext. Note that the privileged
recipients are chosen adaptively by the adversary, even the number of privileged
recipients is unknown until the challenge phase, which makes it more compli-
cated to simulate in the security proof. We partially overcome these issues by
using the semi-adaptive security model, where the adversary should submit the
privileged recipients just after receiving the public parameters. More technique
will be needed to achieve adaptive security for revocable IBBE. As a side prod-
uct, we also propose a new construction of revocable IBE scheme with adaptive
security, which can be as a complementary of Watanabe et al.’s revocable IBE
scheme [38]. In addition, because of using a diﬀerent strategy, the adaptive se-
curity proof of the resulting RIBE scheme in this paper seems more succinct,
compared with the security proof in the full version of [38].
Related Work. Hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) is a simple
extension of IBE which further supports a key delegation functionality. Revo-
cable HIBE can support the revocation of user’s private keys to manage the
dynamic credentials of users in an HIBE system. Several improvement and vari-
ants with diﬀerent properties have been proposed since the ﬁrst revocable HIBE
scheme with DKER introduced by Seo and Emura in [34]. Among them, the
most popular revocable HIBE must be those given in [35,12,24], the security of
which are proven in the selective model where an adversary should submits the
challenge identity or the revocation list before he receives the public parameter-
s. Revocable HIBE with DKER that is secure in the adaptive adversary model
has been proposed in [36,20]. Unfortunately, these constructions are built upon
composite order (product of three primes) bilinear groups, which is ineﬃcient
to implement compared with prime order groups implementation. We note that,
contrary to HIBE, no organization of the users is needed in our revocable IBBE
scheme to have constant size of ciphertexts, i.e., no hierarchy between identities
in our revocable IBBE system.
Besides bilinear maps on elliptic curve, lattice is also a powerful tool to build
cryptographic primitives. Lattice-based constructions, which are conjectured to
be resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, are currently
important candidates for post-quantum cryptography. Chen et al. [8] proposed
the ﬁrst revocable IBE scheme (without DKER) in the lattice setting. Recently,
Katsumata et al. [17] solved the open problem of achieving revocable (H)IBE
with DKER in the lattice setting by proposing a new tool called the level con-
version keys without relying on the key re-randomization property. In addition,
revocable IBE scheme from codes with rank metric is proposed in [7], which is
only proven selective security in the random oracle model.
We stress that the notion of revocation in this paper is referred to indirect
revocation sometimes, since the key authority indirectly enables revocation by
forcing revoked users to be unable to update their keys. A direct revocation
mechanism has been studied for attribute-based encryption [2] and predicate
encryption [27]. This approach requires the sender to carry out the revocation by
specifying a set of revoked users in the ciphertext, and hence it does not need any
5
private key update procedures on the recipients’s side. Recently, another notion
of recipient-revocable identity-based broadcast encryption has been proposed
in [32,22], which mainly focuses on how to remove some of the recipients from
the set of receivers stated in the original ciphertext after the ciphertext has
been generated, but without revealing the message content. Therefore, these
systems [32,22] cannot follow the notion of revocable IBBE in this paper.
Server-aided revocable IBE, recently proposed by Qin et al. [30], is a novel
system where most of the workloads on users are outsourced to an untrusted
server. The server manages users’ public key and key updates sent by the PKG
periodically, and users can compute decryption keys without communicating
with either the PKG or the server. Server-aided revocable IBE [29] and server-
aide directly revocable predicate encryption [23] in the lattice setting have been
proposed recently, which can satisfy selective security without DKER. It is pos-
sible to employ this construction methodology in our revocable IBBE scheme,
which can obtain a server-aided revocable IBBE scheme with DKER.
Organization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next
section, we review some preliminaries used throughout this paper, including the
rigorous deﬁnitions and security model of revocable IBBE scheme. In Section 3,
we present an adaptive secure IBBE scheme with short ciphertexts modiﬁed from
Ramanna’s original inner production encryption scheme [31], which is used as
the core building block of our revocable IBBE scheme. In Section 4, we propose a
concrete construction of revocable IBBE with DKER that can achieve constant
size of ciphertext, together with proof of security in Section 5. To show its
practicability we implement the proposed scheme in Section 6. Finally, Section 7
concludes this paper.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Asymmetric Pairings and Hardness Assumptions
Let G1, G2, GT be cyclic multiplicative groups of the same prime order p. Let g be
a generator of G1 and h be a generator of G2. A bilinear map e : G1 × G2 → GT
has the following properties:
– Bilinearity: For all g ∈ G1, h ∈ G2 and all a, b ∈ Z∗
p, e(ga, hb) = e(g, h)ab.
– Non-degeneracy: e(g, h) (cid:54)= 1.
– Computability: It is eﬃcient to compute e(u, v) for any u ∈ G1 and v ∈ G2.
It is called symmetric (or Type-1) pairing if G1 = G2; otherwise, the pairing
is asymmetric. Two types of asymmetric pairing can be further classiﬁed: Type-
2 and Type-3. If there is an eﬃciently computable isomorphism either from G2
to G1 or from G1 to G2, then the bilinear map e is called a Type-2 pairing. If
no eﬃciently computable isomorphism is known, then we call it Type-3 pairing.
Our constructions in this work are based on Type-3 pairing, which is the most
eﬃcient setting from an implementation point according to [14,9].
The security of our construction is based on the Augmented Decisional Diﬃe-
Hellman on G1 (ADDH1), which is proved security in the generic bilinear group
6
model by Watanabe et al. [38], and Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on G2 (DDH2)
assumptions. Below, we describe these assumptions.
Let G = (p, e, G1, G2, GT ) be a Type-3 pairing with generators g1 ∈ G1 and
g2 ∈ G2. Denote D = (g1, gµ

solving the ADDH1 problem relative to a Type-3 pairing G of the group G1.

Note that the dual of the above deﬁnition 2 with the roles of G1 and G2
reversed is Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman in G1 (DDH1) assumption. The Symmetric
eXternal Diﬃe-Hellman (SXDH) assumption holds if both DDH1 and DDH2
problems are intracable. It can be easily veriﬁed that ADDH1 problem is not
harder than DDH1, as an instance of DDH1 is embedded in the instance of
ADDH1, and an algorithm to solve DDH1 can also be used to solve the ADDH1.

2.2 KUnodes Algorithm
To achieve scalable user revocation, we follow the node selection algorithm
KUNode algorithm by using a binary tree data structure as in the previous RIBE
schemes [6,33,21,38]. We employ similar notations as follows. For a binary tree
BT with N leaves, we denote by root the root node of BT. For a non-leaf node θ,
we write θL and θR as the left and right child of θ, respectively. For a leaf node
η, we write Path(η) as the set of nodes on the path from η to root (both η and
root are inclusive). Each user is assigned to a leaf node η of BT. If a user who is
associated with η is revoked on a time period t, then (η, t) is in the revocation
list RL, i.e., (η, t) ∈RL.
The KUNode algorithm which takes as input a binary tree BT, a revocation
