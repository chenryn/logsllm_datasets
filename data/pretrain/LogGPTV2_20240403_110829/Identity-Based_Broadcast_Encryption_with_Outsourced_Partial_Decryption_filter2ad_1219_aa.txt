## Abstract
Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) is an effective method for securing data and ensuring privacy in multi-receiver scenarios, making broadcast encryption more practical. This paper extends the study of scalable revocation methodologies in IBBE, where a key authority periodically releases key update materials that only non-revoked users can use to update their decryption keys. Using a binary tree data structure, we propose a concrete instantiation of a revocable IBBE scheme using asymmetric pairings of prime order bilinear groups. The proposed scheme is resistant to decryption key exposure and is proven to be semi-adaptively secure under chosen plaintext attacks in the standard model, reducing to static complexity assumptions. Notably, the ciphertext size remains constant, regardless of the number of recipients, making the scheme highly efficient in terms of both computation and communication. To demonstrate its practicality, we implement the scheme in Charm, a framework for rapid prototyping of cryptographic primitives.

## 1. Introduction

Broadcast encryption (BE), first introduced by Fiat and Naor [13], is a cryptographic paradigm enabling the delivery of encrypted content over a broadcast channel, ensuring that only qualified users can decrypt the content. In public key settings, a dealer generates and distributes decryption keys to users. A sender can encrypt data for a set of receivers by choosing their public keys adaptively, and only users with the corresponding private keys can decrypt the data. BE schemes are collusion-resistant if no information about the encrypted data is leaked even if all unqualified users collude. BE has applications in pay-TV, encrypted file systems, and digital rights management.

Identity-based encryption (IBE) is an advanced form of public key encryption where a user's public key is derived from unique identity information (e.g., IP or email address). IBE eliminates the need for a public key infrastructure (PKI) as public keys are derived from identifiers. A trusted third party, the private key generator (PKG), generates secret keys associated with each user's identity. A sender can encrypt a message using the receiver's identity as the public key, and only the intended receiver, who obtains the decryption key from the PKG, can decrypt the message.

Identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) generalizes IBE to a broadcast setting, recognizing users by their identities rather than system-assigned indexes. IBBE is effective for securing data and ensuring privacy in multi-receiver scenarios. A sender can broadcast an encrypted message to any set of intended users, called the privileged set. If the privileged set size is one, the IBBE scheme reduces to an IBE scheme. Constructing an IBBE scheme by encrypting the message for each identity using an IBE scheme results in linear ciphertext size, which is inefficient for large sets of receivers.

In 2007, Delerablée [11] presented the first IBBE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts, though it was only weakly selective-ID secure in the random oracle model. This construction uses the hybrid encryption paradigm: key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and data encapsulation mechanism (DEM), where the broadcast ciphertext encrypts a short symmetric key used to encrypt the long messages. Recently, Ramanna [31] proposed a novel IBBE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts that achieves adaptive security in the standard model.

### Key Revocation in Multi-User Cryptosystems

Efficient user revocation is a desirable feature in multi-user cryptosystems. Malicious users should be immediately expelled, and even honest users should be revoked if their private keys are compromised. Key revocation is well-studied in BE but challenging in IBE due to the absence of public key certificates. Boneh and Franklin [5] suggested a straightforward revocation method for IBE: dividing the system's lifetime into discrete time periods and refreshing private keys for non-revoked users. However, this approach is not scalable and inefficient, as all non-revoked users must update their keys via a secure channel, and the workload on the PKG grows linearly with the number of non-revoked users.

Boldyreva et al. [6] proposed a scalable revocable IBE (RIBE) scheme using tree-based revocation techniques, reducing the PKG's workload to logarithmic in the number of users. Non-revoked users can derive decryption keys from public update keys, while revoked users cannot. Seo and Emura [33] introduced the concept of decryption key exposure resistance (DKER), which ensures that the confidentiality of ciphertexts is not compromised even if a user's decryption key at some periods is exposed. They also proposed the first RIBE scheme with DKER, which has become the default security requirement for RIBE schemes.

### Our Contribution

In this paper, we propose a novel construction of a revocable IBBE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts. We define the syntax of revocable IBBE using the KEM-DEM paradigm and its security model, considering the realistic threat of decryption key exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of revocable IBBE with provable security. Specifically, our revocable IBBE scheme has the following merits:

1. **Efficiency**: Our scheme is a KEM that produces a symmetric key along with a header, allowing long messages to be encrypted under a short symmetric key. The header size is constant, independent of the number of underlying receivers, making it efficient in both communication and computation. Only four group elements and a tag are needed in the ciphertext header, comparable to the revocable IBE scheme in [38]. We implement it in the Charm framework [3].

2. **Public Parameters and Private Keys**: The public parameters in our scheme are linear in the maximum size of the privileged identities set, \( m \), which is predetermined and fixed in the setup phase. The private key for each user is linear in the value of \( m \log_2 N \), where \( N \) is the maximal number of system users, also predetermined in the setup phase.

3. **Revocation Methodology**: Our scheme follows Boldyreva et al.'s revocation methodology [6] using a binary tree data structure, reducing the key update workload from linear to logarithmic in the number of system users. The PKG broadcasts update key information through a public channel, which is useless for already revoked users. Non-revoked users can combine the update key and their private key to derive a decryption key for proper ciphertexts. The size of the update key is \( O(r \log_2 (N/r)) \) if \( r \leq N/2 \), or \( O(N - r) \) if \( r > N/2 \), where \( r \) is the number of revoked users.

4. **Security Assumptions**: Our construction is built upon prime order bilinear groups of Type-3 pairings under mild variants of the Symmetric eXternal Diﬃe-Hellman (SXDH) assumption: the Augmented Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on \( G_1 \) (ADDH1) and Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on \( G_2 \) (DDH2). ADDH1 is first defined by Watanabe et al. in [38] and is proven in the generic bilinear group model.

5. **Security Proofs**: Our revocable IBBE scheme is semi-adaptively secure with DKER under chosen plaintext attacks. Semi-adaptive security, first proposed by Chen and Wee [10], lies between selective and adaptive security for functional encryption systems. If the maximum size of receivers \( m \) is set to 1, the resulting revocable IBBE scheme becomes a revocable IBE system, achieving adaptive security with DKER.

### Design Approach

Our design approach is similar to Seo and Emura's technique of transforming IBE to RIBE in [33, 38]. We start with a basic IBBE scheme that satisfies the secret key re-randomization property and the applicability of the Boneh-Boyen technique [4]. We then construct an adaptively secure RIBE scheme with DKER by applying the Seo-Emura technique. The basic IBBE is derived from Ramanna's recent IBBE scheme [31], with necessary modifications to achieve the secret key re-randomization property. The security of the revocable IBBE scheme with DKER is reduced to the adaptive security of the basic IBBE scheme.

### Related Work

Hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) is a simple extension of IBE supporting key delegation. Revocable HIBE manages dynamic credentials by revoking user's private keys. Several improvements and variants have been proposed since the first revocable HIBE scheme with DKER by Seo and Emura [34]. Most popular revocable HIBE schemes are [35, 12, 24], proven secure in the selective model. Revocable HIBE with DKER secure in the adaptive adversary model has been proposed in [36, 20], but these constructions are built on composite order bilinear groups, which are less efficient than prime order groups.

Lattice-based constructions, conjectured to be resistant to both classical and quantum attacks, are important candidates for post-quantum cryptography. Chen et al. [8] proposed the first revocable IBE scheme without DKER in the lattice setting. Katsumata et al. [17] achieved revocable (H)IBE with DKER in the lattice setting using level conversion keys. Revocable IBE from codes with rank metric is proposed in [7], proven selectively secure in the random oracle model.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1 Asymmetric Pairings and Hardness Assumptions

Let \( G_1, G_2, G_T \) be cyclic multiplicative groups of the same prime order \( p \). Let \( g \) be a generator of \( G_1 \) and \( h \) be a generator of \( G_2 \). A bilinear map \( e : G_1 \times G_2 \to G_T \) has the following properties:
- **Bilinearity**: For all \( g \in G_1 \), \( h \in G_2 \), and all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_p^* \), \( e(g^a, h^b) = e(g, h)^{ab} \).
- **Non-degeneracy**: \( e(g, h) \neq 1 \).
- **Computability**: It is efficient to compute \( e(u, v) \) for any \( u \in G_1 \) and \( v \in G_2 \).

If \( G_1 = G_2 \), the pairing is symmetric (Type-1); otherwise, it is asymmetric. Two types of asymmetric pairings are Type-2 and Type-3. If there is an efficiently computable isomorphism from \( G_2 \) to \( G_1 \) or vice versa, the bilinear map is a Type-2 pairing. If no such isomorphism is known, it is a Type-3 pairing. Our constructions are based on Type-3 pairings, which are the most efficient from an implementation perspective [14, 9].

The security of our construction is based on the Augmented Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on \( G_1 \) (ADDH1) and Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on \( G_2 \) (DDH2) assumptions.

#### Augmented Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on \( G_1 \) (ADDH1)

Let \( G = (p, e, G_1, G_2, G_T) \) be a Type-3 pairing with generators \( g_1 \in G_1 \) and \( g_2 \in G_2 \). Denote \( D = (g_1, g_1^\mu, g_1^{\beta\alpha}, g_1^{\alpha_2}, g_1^{1/\beta}) \) with the distribution: \( \alpha, \alpha_2, \mu \xleftarrow{R} \mathbb{Z}_p \), \( \beta, \eta \xleftarrow{R} \mathbb{Z}_p^* \). A PPT algorithm \( A \) given \( D \) and \( Z \), whose task is to distinguish \( Z = Z_0 = g_1^{\mu\alpha_2} \) (the case \( A \) will output 0) or \( Z = Z_1 = g_1^{\mu\alpha_2 + \eta} \) (the case \( A \) will output 1), has advantage:

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{ADDH1}}^{G, A}(\lambda) = \left| \Pr[A(G, D, Z_0) = 1] - \Pr[A(G, D, Z_1) = 1] \right|
\]

We say that the ADDH1 assumption holds if the advantage for all PPT adversaries \( \text{Adv}_{\text{ADDH1}}^{G, A}(\lambda) \) is negligible in the security parameter \( \lambda \) in solving the ADDH1 problem relative to a Type-3 pairing \( G \) of the group \( G_1 \).

#### Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman on \( G_2 \) (DDH2)

Let \( G = (p, e, G_1, G_2, G_T) \) be a Type-3 pairing. The DDH2 assumption is defined as follows:

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{DDH2}}^{G, A}(\lambda) = \left| \Pr[A(G, D, g_2^{\mu\alpha}) = 1] - \Pr[A(G, D, g_2^{\mu\alpha + \eta}) = 1] \right|
\]

where \( D = (g_1, g_2, g_2^\mu) \) and the distribution: \( \alpha, \mu \xleftarrow{R} \mathbb{Z}_p \), \( \eta \xleftarrow{R} \mathbb{Z}_p^* \).

We say that the DDH2 assumption holds for the group \( G_2 \) of Type-3 pairing \( G \) if the advantage \( \text{Adv}_{\text{DDH2}}^{G, A}(\lambda) \) is negligible in \( \lambda \) for all PPT algorithms \( A \).

### 2.2 KUNodes Algorithm

To achieve scalable user revocation, we follow the node selection algorithm (KUNode) using a binary tree data structure, as in previous RIBE schemes [6, 33, 21, 38]. We employ similar notations as follows. For a binary tree \( BT \) with \( N \) leaves, we denote the root node by \( \text{root} \). For a non-leaf node \( \theta \), we write \( \theta_L \) and \( \theta_R \) as the left and right child of \( \theta \), respectively. For a leaf node \( \eta \), we write \( \text{Path}(\eta) \) as the set of nodes on the path from \( \eta \) to \( \text{root} \) (both \( \eta \) and \( \text{root} \) are inclusive). Each user is assigned to a leaf node \( \eta \) of \( BT \). If a user associated with \( \eta \) is revoked in a time period \( t \), then \( (\eta, t) \) is in the revocation list \( RL \), i.e., \( (\eta, t) \in RL \).

The KUNode algorithm takes as input a binary tree \( BT \) and a revocation list \( RL \). It outputs a set of nodes that cover all non-revoked users in the current time period.
