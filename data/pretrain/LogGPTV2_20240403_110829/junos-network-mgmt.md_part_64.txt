### Configuring Destination-Class-Usage Statement

When the `destination-class-usage` statement is configured, the destination class profile automatically identifies all interfaces that have the destination class set.

### Applying a Filter Profile to a Firewall Filter

To apply a filter profile to a firewall filter, include the `accounting-profile` statement at the `[edit firewall filter filter-name]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit firewall]
filter filter-name {
    accounting-profile profile-name;
}
```

Note: You do not need to apply the Routing Engine profile to an interface, as the statistics are collected directly on the Routing Engine.

### Configuring Accounting-Data Log Files

#### Overview

An accounting profile specifies which statistics to collect and write to a log file. To configure an accounting-data log file, include the `file` statement at the `[edit accounting-options]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit accounting-options]
cleanup-interval {
    interval days;
}

file filename {
    archive-sites {
        site-name;
    }
    backup-on-failure (master-and-slave | master-only);
    files number;
    nonpersistent;
    push-backup-to-master;
    size bytes;
    start-time time;
    transfer-interval minutes;
}
```

- **filename**: The name of the file where accounting data will be written. If the filename contains spaces, enclose it in quotation marks (`" "`). The filename cannot contain a forward slash (`/`). The file is created in the `/var/log` directory and can contain data from multiple profiles.
- **Header and Trailer Sections**: All accounting-data log files include header and trailer sections that start with a `#` in the first column. The header contains the file creation time, the hostname, and the columns that appear in the file. The trailer contains the time that the file was closed.
- **Profile Layout Records**: Whenever any configured value changes that affects the columns in a file, a new profile layout record is created with a new list of columns.
- **File Size Configuration**: You must configure the file size; all other properties are optional.

#### Detailed Configuration Steps

1. **Configure How Long Backup Files Are Retained**
   - Configure the number of days files are retained in the local directory before they are deleted.
   - Default retention is 1 day if not configured.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options]
     user@host# set cleanup-interval interval days
     ```

2. **Configure the Maximum Size of the File**
   - Specify the maximum size of the log file in bytes, kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), or gigabytes (GB).
   - Minimum value for bytes is 256 KB.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set size bytes;
     ```

3. **Configure Archive Sites for the Files**
   - After a file reaches its maximum size or the transfer interval is exceeded, the file is closed, renamed, and transferred to a remote host if an archive site is configured.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set archive-sites site-name
     ```
   - **site-name**: A valid FTP URL. For more information, see the Junos OS Administration Library.

4. **Configure Local Backup for Accounting Files**
   - Save a copy of the accounting file locally when the normal transfer to the archive site fails.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set backup-on-failure (master-and-slave | master-only)
     ```

5. **Configure Files to Be Compressed**
   - By default, accounting files are transferred in an uncompressed format. You can configure compression to conserve resources.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set compress
     ```

6. **Configure the Maximum Number of Files**
   - Specify the maximum number of log files. When the limit is reached, the oldest log file is overwritten.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set files number
     ```

7. **Configure the Storage Location of the File**
   - On J Series Services Routers, files are stored by default on the compact flash drive. You can configure them to be stored in the `mfs/var/log` directory (on DRAM) instead.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set nonpersistent
     ```

8. **Configure Files to Be Saved After a Change in Primary Role**
   - Save the accounting files from the new backup Routing Engine to the new primary Routing Engine when a change in primary role occurs.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set push-backup-to-master
     ```

9. **Configure the Start Time for File Transfer**
   - Specify the start time for transferring files.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options file filename]
     user@host# set start-time YYYY-MM-DD.hh:mm
     ```

10. **Configure the Transfer Interval of the File**
    - Specify the interval at which files are transferred.
    - Example:
      ```plaintext
      [edit accounting-options file filename]
      user@host# set transfer-interval minutes
      ```

### Managing Accounting Files

- **SRX Devices**: If you configure SRX devices to capture accounting data in log files, set the location for your accounting files to DRAM to minimize read/write traffic to the CompactFlash (CF) card.
- **CAUTION**: If log files for accounting data are stored on DRAM, these files are lost when the device reboots. Therefore, it is recommended to back up these files periodically.

### Configuring the Interface Profile

#### Overview

An interface profile specifies the information collected and written to a log file. You can configure a profile to collect error and statistic information for input and output packets on a particular physical or logical interface.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Configure Fields**
   - Specify which statistics should be collected for an interface.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options interface-profile profile-name]
     fields {
         field-name;
     }
     ```

2. **Configure the File Information**
   - Specify the file to use for logging statistics.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options interface-profile profile-name]
     file filename;
     ```

3. **Configure Cleared Statistics to be Reported in the Flat File**
   - Include the `allow-clear` statement to reset and report cleared statistics to the flat file.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options interface-profile profile-name]
     allow-clear;
     ```

4. **Configure the Interval**
   - Specify the interval at which statistics are collected.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options interface-profile profile-name]
     interval minutes;
     ```

### Configuring the Filter Profile

#### Overview

A filter profile specifies error and statistics information collected and written to a file. A filter profile must specify counter names for which statistics are collected.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Configure the Counters**
   - Specify the counters for which statistics are collected.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options filter-profile profile-name]
     counters {
         counter-name;
     }
     ```

2. **Configure the File Information**
   - Specify the file to use for logging statistics.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options filter-profile profile-name]
     file filename;
     ```

3. **Configure the Interval**
   - Specify the interval at which statistics are collected.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     [edit accounting-options filter-profile profile-name]
     interval minutes;
     ```

By following these steps, you can effectively configure and manage accounting-data log files, interface profiles, and filter profiles in your network.
