User: I have Python script bgservice.py and I want it to run all the time, because it is part of the web service I build. How can I make it run continuously even after I logout SSH?
Assistant: Alternate answer: tmux

ssh into the remote machine
type tmux into cmd
start the process you want inside the tmux e.g. python3 main.py
leaving the tmux session by Ctrl+b then d

It is now safe to exit the remote machine. When you come back use tmux attach to re-enter tmux session.
If you want to start multiple sessions, name each session using Ctrl+b then $. then type your session name.
to list all session use tmux list-sessions
to attach a running session use tmux attach-session -t <session-name>.
