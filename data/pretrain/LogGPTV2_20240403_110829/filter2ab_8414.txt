**ATT&CK ID:** M1052  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Control (UAC)

Setting the UAC configuration to "Always Notify" increases the visibility of elevation requests, providing users with more detailed information about when and why elevated privileges are being requested. However, this setting may be unpopular among users due to the frequent interruptions caused by UAC prompts.
