within a span of a few minutes, suggesting that collabo-
rative detection of such attackers has to be in realtime.
4 ATTACK CORRELATION STRUCTURE
Why is the structure of attack correlation important?
Since correlation is prevalent, it would be beneﬁcial for
IDSs to collaborate to speedup the detection of com-
mon attackers. However, in §3.3, we have shown that
common attackers attack their victim networks within
a few minutes of each other. Thus, to eﬀectively collab-
orate against common attackers, the IDSs need to ex-
change information in realtime. An IDS in our dataset
generates on average 1500 alerts/hour. Exchanging
alerts in realtime with thousands of IDSs creates an
unacceptable overhead. Thus, we are interested in ﬁnd-
ing how many collaborators each IDS needs to have in
order to achieve the beneﬁts of collaboration without
incurring much overhead. To answer this question, we
examine the spatial and temporal structures of attack
correlation, i.e., how many IDSs are usually correlated
with each other and how often does the set of IDSs a
particular IDS is correlated with change over time?
4.1 Correlated IDSs
For the objective of detecting common attackers, an
IDS beneﬁts from exchanging alerts with only those
IDSs whose attacks are correlated with its own. We
call this set of IDSs its correlation group. If correla-
tion groups are small, i.e., much smaller than all IDSs,
then by focusing only on the IDSs in its correlation
group, an IDS can achieve most of the beneﬁts of the
collaboration at little overhead.
We plot in Figure 7 the CDF of the number of IDSs
with which an IDS is correlated (i.e., the size of its cor-
relation group) for all 1700 IDSs in our dataset. We
consider two cases: simultaneous correlation, in which
two attacks are correlated if they share the same source
IP and happen within 10 minutes of each other, and
general correlation, in which two attacks are correlated
if they share the source IP. The former helps detect
distributed attacks, while the latter helps detect ma-
licious sources which should be blacklisted. General
correlation is by deﬁnition greater than simultaneous
correlation. The ﬁgure shows that on average each IDS
is correlated with 4− 6 other IDSs, i.e., less than 0.4%
of the total number of IDSs. Further, 96% of the IDSs
are correlated with less than 10 IDSs.
Note that the plots for simultaneous and general cor-
relation are fairly similar. Though the average number
of IDSs with which an IDS shares attacks increases to
nearly 5, the CDF does not change much. Again, this
shows that when correlated attacks happen at diﬀerent
locations in the Internet, most likely they happen with
a short period.
4.2 Persistence of IDS Correlation
We would like to examine how often the correlation
group of an IDS changes.
If the membership of the
correlation group of an IDS is stable then each network
can spend the time to identify its correlation group
oﬄine. Once the correlation group is identiﬁed, the
actual exchange of alerts is done in realtime. On the
other hand, if the members of an IDS’ correlation group
keep changing over short intervals, collaboration will be
hard as it requires re-examining attack correlation and
deciding in realtime whether to collaborate.
We need to deﬁne a measure of how a group of IDSs
is changing. We assign the IDSs consecutive IDs. For

Time in days
Figure 8: Figure shows that the group of IDSs
which experiences attacks correlated with attacks
at a particular IDS does not change for the duration
of our 3 datasets (about a month). The y-axis is
the normalized diﬀerence in the correlation vector
deﬁned in Equation 1.
each IDS i in our dataset, we create a correlation vec-
tor ~vi(n) whose length is equal to the total number
of IDSs in the dataset. We set vij(n) = 1 if IDS i is
correlated with IDS j, and 0 otherwise based on the
alerts they generate on day n. For example, ~vi(16) =
(0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0) means that IDS i and IDSs 2,3, and
5 see correlated attacks on the 16th day in our dataset.
The diﬀerence vector for two days for a given IDS
is the vector obtained by subtracting the correspond-
ing correlation vectors for those days. For example,
the diﬀerence vi(17) − vi(0) indicates how the correla-
tion group of IDS i changes over a period of 17 days,
starting on day 0 in our logs.
We measure the persistence of attack correlation as
a function of time using the following metric:
X
i
fm−n =
1
N
||~vi(m) − ~vi(n)||
||~vi(n)||
,
(1)
where N = 1700 is the number of IDSs; vi is the corre-
lation vector of IDS i; and ||~v|| is the Euclidean norm
of the vector. Thus, fm−n is the average change in the
norm of the correlation vector between day n and day
m where m > n, normalized by the size of that vector.

tack correlation fi as a function of time in days along
with the standard deviation. It shows that, the correla-
tion vector does not change signiﬁcantly with time. In
particular, on average the correlation vector changes
by less than 0.025 of its original value over a period
that spans a whole month. The insigniﬁcant change
shows that correlation happens consistently with the
same group of IDSs and is persistent over time.
4.3 Robustness to Source Spooﬁng
The correlation shown above considers all attacks, in-
cluding those which could be from spoofed source ad-
dresses. Intuitively, one would expect that source spoof-
ing does not aﬀect the correlation structure as it is
usually done randomly, and thus unlikely to create a
well-deﬁned structure. In order to estimate the eﬀect
of spoofed sources on our results we divide the logged
attacks into two classes:
• Connection oriented attacks: Attacks which re-
quire establishing a TCP connection. This in-
cludes most non-ﬂooding attacks and application
layer attacks (e.g SQL server, MS IIS server etc)
and formed 68% of all attacks.
• Connectionless attacks: Attacks which get ﬂagged
due to incomplete TCP connection attempts or
those which do not require a TCP connection.
(e.g. SYN ﬂoods, UDP packet ﬂoods etc).
We can perform this classiﬁcation only on the ISP data
and one of the Univ logs (U1). The rest of the logs do
not contain the necessary information. Connection-
oriented attacks should not have spoofed IP addresses
since they require the attacking machine to respond to
the TCP ACKs sent by the victim.
Figure 9 compares the correlation exhibited by the
connection oriented attacks to that exhibited by the
combination of all attacks. The ﬁgure plots the CDF of

Difference in entropy (bits)
Figure 10: Figure shows that the set of IDSs with
which an IDS is correlated is far from random. We
compare the distribution of correlated IDSs in our
dataset with that generated by having each com-
mon attacker target a small random set of IDSs.
The diﬀerence in entropy between random target-
ing and the empirical data is plotted. The empirical
distribution has, on average, 7.2 bits less entropy
than the one generated by random targeting; cor-
related IDSs are therefore far from random.
the size of the correlation group for each IDS for each
kind of attack. The ﬁgure shows that the two CDFs
are very close, indicating that the correlation structure
is highly robust to source spooﬁng. Similarly, we have
performed the correlation persistence test in §4.2 on
connection oriented attacks and found the results to
be compatible with those in §4.2.
4.4 Is the structure due to random scans?
The fact that each IDS in our dataset shares attacks
with only a small and persistent set of IDSs is intrigu-
ing. Why do certain IDSs share attacks? Before an-
swering this question, we would like to do an addi-
tional test to ensure that the spatial structure of at-
tack correlation is not random. Suppose each worm
or attacker picks for victims a random subset of all
destinations, could this be responsible for generating
the attack correlation structure we see in the data?
The test described below shows that the answer to
the this question is “no”. The correlated attacks we
see are likely targeted attacks, i.e., the victims are not
randomly chosen; the same group of correlated victim
networks are chosen repeatedly, probably because they
are on one hit list circulating among the attackers, or
because they run the same software (as in the case of
the Santy worm [6]).
We consider the distribution of IDSs with which a
particular IDS is correlated. We compare this distri-
bution in our data with the corresponding distribution
generated by random targeting. We simulate random
targeting as follows. We pick an IDS, i, and look at all
of its correlated attacks. For each correlated attack,
we replace the set of IDSs with which IDS i shares this
attack with a random set of IDSs of the same size. We
repeat this process for each attack at IDS i. For each
IDS j, where j 6= i, the number of correlated attacks
with i, after proper normalization, represents the prob-
ability that IDS j is correlated with IDS i. We compare
this probability distribution in our data with the one
generated by random attack targeting.
In our data,
this distribution is highly biased, i.e., an IDS i is cor-
related with a few other IDSs and uncorrelated with
the rest of IDSs. Since we are interested in measuring
how far our data is from random targeting, we compare
the entropy of the two distributions. The entropy of
the distribution of a random variable X is:
