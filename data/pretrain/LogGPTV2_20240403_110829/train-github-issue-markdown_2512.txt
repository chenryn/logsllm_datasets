Waypoint: Bring your JavaScript Slot Machine to Life
I added the following code to Basic Javascript Waypoint 39:
    $( $ )
The page froze and I could not interact with it. I tried refreshing and it
would freeze once the page loaded because my code was still there. I don't
know how to clear out the code so I can start the Waypoint over and complete
it.
