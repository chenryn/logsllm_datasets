**Waypoint: Bring Your JavaScript Slot Machine to Life**

I encountered an issue while working on Basic JavaScript Waypoint 39. I added the following code:

```javascript
$( $ )
```

After adding this code, the page froze, and I was unable to interact with it. Even after refreshing, the page would freeze again upon loading because the problematic code was still present. I am unsure how to remove or clear out this code so that I can start the Waypoint over and complete it.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?
