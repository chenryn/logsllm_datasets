### Actors, Peers, and Services: Interaction in the Service Ecosystem

Actors, peers, or services interact with each other within a service ecosystem. This interaction is facilitated by a marketplace that demonstrates how services are traded over the Internet. According to Barros and Dumas (2006), Web Service Ecosystems (WSE) represent an evolution of Service-oriented Architecture (SoA). They describe SoA as a novel paradigm that integrates legacy applications, automates business processes, and fosters technical integration between different legal entities.

### Evolution from SoA to WSE

In contrast to embedding business logic into hard-wired applications, software developers define technical services as fine-grained, reusable, and loosely coupled functionalities. These can be combined according to actual business requirements. Barros and Dumas refer to WSE as "a logical collection of web services." Recent developments show that when companies adopt this paradigm, services are treated as valuable assets that can be exposed to other companies, enabling them to offer, procure, and trade these assets beyond organizational boundaries.

### Roles of Actors in Service Trade

Existing literature reviews in the area of service ecosystems (Barros & Dumas, 2006; Riedl, Bohmann, Leimeister, & H, 2009; Blau, Kramer, Conte, & van Dinther, 2009) and business value webs (Tapscott, Ticoll, & Lowy, 2000) identify various roles for actors. Table 1 provides an overview of these roles:

**Table 1: Overview of Actor Roles**

| **Role** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Consumer** | Demands and consumes goods and services. |
| **Context Provider** | Provides the context in which services are used. |
| **Content Provider** | Designs, creates, and delivers goods and services. |
| **Commerce Service Provider** | Offers cross-sectional services such as financial management, security, logistics, and monitoring. |
| **Infrastructure Provider** | Provides communication platforms, computing, buildings, networks, facilities, and roads. |
| **Service Broker** | Brings providers and consumers together and enhances services with delivery functions. |
| **Service Mediator** | Customizes standard services to meet consumer needs. |

### Service Lifecycle in the Internet of Services (IoS)

A service goes through several states during its lifecycle, which can be broadly categorized into design time and run time. During the design phase, service ideas are transformed into operational and technical implementations. During the execution phase, services are consumed. This general distinction can be further refined into four phases: service innovation, service design, service usage, and service monitoring and evolution. Figure 2 illustrates these phases.

### Challenges in Service Discovery and Interaction

Barros and Dumas (2006) highlight several issues in realizing a successful IoS, including service discovery, conversational multiparty interactions, and service mediation and adaptation. The current service discovery process relies on keyword-based searches, which works well in closed environments but not in multi-actor marketplaces. They advocate for a combination of free-text and ontology-based search to address this issue.

### Service Engineering and Innovation

Service engineering for both SoA and evolving service marketplaces in the Internet remains challenging due to dynamic environments, high uncertainties, and increasing coopetition among market participants. An effective approach must support service engineering in terms of planning, designing, and implementing services, while addressing stakeholders from both business and IT. This approach should also target business services such as insurance, financial, civil, marketing, and telecommunication services.

### Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) Framework

The ISE Framework, based on the Zachman framework, bridges the gap between business and technical perspectives. It includes four perspectives (strategic, conceptual, logical, and technical) and five service aspects (service description, process description, actor description, rule description, and data description). Each intersection in the matrix represents a meta-model, notation, and activities appropriate for the respective perspective and modeling aspect.

**Figure 3: Service Perspectives and Aspects in the ISE Framework**

### ISE Workbench

The Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) Workbench implements the ISE Framework and supports an interdisciplinary structured service engineering process. It builds on Eclipse’s Rich Client Platform (RCP), allowing the integration of existing tools and the development of new ones. The workbench includes 20 editors to model the five service aspects for each of the four perspectives, using OMG’s Query View Transformation (QVT) specification for model transformations.

### Main Functionality and Notations

To support the ISE Framework, available notations were analyzed, resulting in a set of 20 modeling notations. Each chosen notation has a suitable editor integrated into the workbench to design all service aspects from different angles. The models are divided into four layers of abstraction, leading to multiple representations.

This structured approach ensures that services can be effectively designed, implemented, and traded over the Internet, meeting the needs of both business and technical stakeholders.
