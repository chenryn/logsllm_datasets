User: Looking to dabble with GAE and python, and I'd like to know what are some of the best tools for this - thanks!
Assistant: For my recent GAE project I tried both eclipse with pydev and intellij with its python plugin. I use intellij for my "real" work and so I found it to be the most natural and easy to use, personally. It is not open source, but if you already have a license it is no extra cost.  
I found the eclipse plugin to be very good as well. You don't get as much intellisense as you would with java, but I was very impressed with what you do get from a dynamically typed language.
