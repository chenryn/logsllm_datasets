I'm interested in exploring Google App Engine (GAE) with Python. Could you recommend some of the best tools for this? Thanks!

For my recent GAE project, I evaluated both Eclipse with PyDev and IntelliJ IDEA with its Python plugin. Personally, I found IntelliJ IDEA to be the most intuitive and user-friendly, especially since I already use it for other development work. While IntelliJ IDEA is not open source, if you already have a license, there are no additional costs.

The Eclipse plugin, PyDev, is also quite robust. Although it doesn't offer as much intelligent code completion (IntelliSense) as you might find with Java, I was still impressed with the level of support it provides for a dynamically typed language like Python.
