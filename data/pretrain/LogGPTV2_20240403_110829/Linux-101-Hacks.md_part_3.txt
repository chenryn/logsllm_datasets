Chapter 4: Essential Linux Commands
Hack 17. Grep Command
grep command is used to search files for a specific text. This is incredibly
powerful command with lot of options.
Syntax: grep [options] pattern [files]
How can I find all lines matching a specific keyword on a file?
In this example, grep looks for the text John inside /etc/passwd file and
displays all the matching lines.
# grep John /etc/passwd
jsmith:x:1082:1082:John Smith:/home/jsmith:/bin/bash
jdoe:x:1083:1083:John Doe:/home/jdoe:/bin/bash
Option -v, will display all the lines except the match. In the example below,
it displays all the records from /etc/password that doesn't match John.
Note: There are several lines in the /etc/password that doesn’t contain the
word John. Only the first line of the output is shown below.
# grep -v John /etc/passwd
jbourne:x:1084:1084:Jason Bourne:/home/jbourne:/bin/bash
How many lines matched the text pattern in a particular file?
In the example below, it displays the total number of lines that contains the
text John in /etc/passwd file.
31
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
# grep -c John /etc/passwd
2
You can also get the total number of lines that did not match the specific
pattern by passing option -cv.
# grep -cv John /etc/passwd
39
How to search a text by ignoring the case?
Pass the option -i (ignore case), which will ignore the case while searching.
# grep -i john /etc/passwd
jsmith:x:1082:1082:John Smith:/home/jsmith:/bin/bash
jdoe:x:1083:1083:John Doe:/home/jdoe:/bin/bash
How do I search all subdirectories for a text matching a specific
pattern?
Use option -r (recursive) for this purpose. In the example below, it will search
for the text "John" by ignoring the case inside all the subdirectories under
/home/users.
This will display the output in the format of "filename: line that matching the
pattern". You can also pass the option -l, which will display only the name of
the file that matches the pattern.
# grep -ri john /home/users
/home/users/subdir1/letter.txt:John, Thanks for your
contribution.
/home/users/name_list.txt:John Smith
32
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
/home/users/name_list.txt:John Doe
# grep -ril john /root
/home/users/subdir1/letter.txt
/home/users/name_list.txt
Hack 18. Find Command
find is frequently used command to find files in the UNIX filesystem based on
numerous conditions. Let us review some practice examples of find command.
Syntax: find [pathnames] [conditions]
How to find files containing a specific word in its name?
The following command looks for all the files under /etc directory with mail
in the filename.
# find /etc -name "*mail*"
How to find all the files greater than certain size?
The following command will list all the files in the system greater than
100MB.
# find / -type f -size +100M
How to find files that are not modified in the last x number of days?
The following command will list all the files that were modified more than 60
days ago under the current directory.
33
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
# find . -mtime +60
How to find files that are modified in the last x number of days?
The following command will list all the files that were modified in the last
two days under the current directory.
# find . –mtime -2
How to delete all the archive files with extension *.tar.gz and
greater than 100MB?
Please be careful while executing the following command as you don’t want
to delete the files by mistake. The best practice is to execute the same
command with ls –l to make sure you know which files will get deleted when
you execute the command with rm.
# find / -type f -name *.tar.gz -size +100M -exec ls -l {} \;
# find / -type f -name *.tar.gz -size +100M -exec rm -f {} \;
How to archive all the files that are not modified in the last x
number of days?
The following command finds all the files not modified in the last 60 days
under /home/jsmith directory and creates an archive files under /tmp in the
format of ddmmyyyy_archive.tar.
# find /home/jsmith -type f -mtime +60 | xargs tar -cvf
/tmp/`date '+%d%m%Y'_archive.tar`
On a side note, you can perform lot of file related activities (including finding
files) using midnight commander GUI, a powerful text based file manager for
Unix.

Hack 19. Suppress Standard Output and Error
Message
Sometime while debugging a shell script, you may not want to see either the
standard output or standard error message. Use /dev/null as shown below for
suppressing the output.
Suppress standard output using > /dev/null
This will be very helpful when you are debugging shell scripts, where you
don’t want to display the echo statement and interested in only looking at
the error messages.
# cat file.txt > /dev/null
# ./shell-script.sh > /dev/null
Suppress standard error using 2> /dev/null
This is also helpful when you are interested in viewing only the standard
output and don’t want to view the error messages.
# cat invalid-file-name.txt 2> /dev/null
# ./shell-script.sh 2> /dev/null
Hack 20. Join Command
Join command combines lines from two files based on a common field.
In the example below, we have two files – employee.txt and salary.txt. Both
have employee-id as common field. So, we can use join command to combine
35
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
the data from these two files using employee-id as shown below.
$ cat employee.txt
100 Jason Smith
200 John Doe
300 Sanjay Gupta
400 Ashok Sharma
$ cat bonus.txt
100 $5,000
200 $500
300 $3,000
400 $1,250
$ join employee.txt bonus.txt
100 Jason Smith $5,000
200 John Doe $500
300 Sanjay Gupta $3,000
400 Ashok Sharma $1,250
Hack 21. Change the Case
Convert a file to all upper-case
$ cat employee.txt
100 Jason Smith
200 John Doe
300 Sanjay Gupta
400 Ashok Sharma
$ tr a-z A-Z < employee.txt
100 JASON SMITH
200 JOHN DOE
300 SANJAY GUPTA
36
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
400 ASHOK SHARMA
Convert a file to all lower-case
$ cat department.txt
100 FINANCE
200 MARKETING
300 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
400 SALES
$ tr A-Z a-z < department.txt
100 finance
200 marketing
300 product development
400 sales
Hack 22. Xargs Command
xargs is a very powerful command that takes output of a command and pass it
as argument of another command. Following are some practical examples on
how to use xargs effectively.
1. When you are trying to delete too many files using rm, you may get error
message: /bin/rm Argument list too long – Linux. Use xargs to avoid this
problem.
find ~ -name ‘*.log’ -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
2. Get a list of all the *.conf file under /etc/. There are different ways to get
the same result. Following example is only to demonstrate the use of xargs.
The output of the find command in this example is passed to the ls –l one by
one using xargs.
37
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
# find /etc -name "*.conf" | xargs ls –l
3. If you have a file with list of URLs that you would like to download, you can
use xargs as shown below.
# cat url-list.txt | xargs wget –c
4. Find out all the jpg images and archive it.
# find / -name *.jpg -type f -print | xargs tar -cvzf
images.tar.gz
5. Copy all the images to an external hard-drive.
# ls *.jpg | xargs -n1 -i cp {} /external-hard-
drive/directory
Hack 23. Sort Command
Sort command sorts the lines of a text file. Following are several practical
examples on how to use the sort command based on the following sample text
file that has employee information in the format:
employee_name:employee_id:department_name.
$ cat names.txt

Hack 24. Uniq Command
Uniq command is mostly used in combination with sort command, as uniq
removes duplicates only from a sorted file. i.e In order for uniq to work, all
the duplicate entries should be in the adjacent lines. Following are some
common examples.
1. When you have an employee file with duplicate entries, you can do the
following to remove duplicates.
$ sort namesd.txt | uniq
$ sort –u namesd.txt
2. If you want to know how many lines are duplicates, do the following. The
first field in the following examples indicates how many duplicates where
found for that particular line. So, in this example the lines beginning with
Alex and Emma were found twice in the namesd.txt file.
$ sort namesd.txt | uniq –c
2 Alex Jason:200:Sales
2 Emma Thomas:100:Marketing
1 Madison Randy:300:Product Development
