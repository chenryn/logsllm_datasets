User: Please provide a plan on network security, including network isolation, intrusion detection and DDoS protection, and recommend suitable network security products.
Assistant: 1. Network isolation scheme 1. Physical isolation: isolate the internal network from the external network by means of hardware, connect the internal and external networks to different routers and switches, and implement data forwarding and restriction through ACL or firewall configuration strategies. 2. Virtual isolation: using virtualization technology, a physical server is divided into multiple different virtualized server instances, each instance has its own independent network address space, so as to achieve the effect of isolation. Suitable network security products: 1. Routers: Huawei Tenda, Cisco, ZTE and other brands of enterprise-level routers, with a variety of security mechanisms, such as ACL, VLAN, IPsec VPN, etc., can effectively isolate the internal and external networks. 2. Firewall: Enterprise-level firewalls of Huawei USG series, Symantec, NSFOCUS and other brands have various Internet security mechanisms, such as UTM, IPS, VPN, WAF, etc., which can provide comprehensive security protection for the network. 2. Intrusion detection scheme 1. Network intrusion detection system: By recording data flow in the network, protocol analysis technology and other means, detect abnormal flow and malicious behavior in the network, and give relevant security alarms. 2. Host intrusion detection system: Through real-time monitoring of the host, every event that occurs in the system is recorded and compared to determine whether there is an intrusion or other behavior. Suitable network security products: 1. Alibaba Cloud Cloud Shield: Provides a variety of intrusion detection services such as personal version, basic version, professional version, and enterprise version. It has functions such as solid state drives, cloud mirroring, and comprehensive domestic monitoring. location security. 2. Trojan horse immune system: a host intrusion detection system, which can monitor and detect the files, logs, registry and memory of the website host in real time, effectively preventing Trojan horses, viruses and other intrusions. 3. DDoS protection scheme 1. Blacklist: implement blacklist or whitelist strategy based on IP or MAC address, and restrict or release specific hosts. 2. DDoS attack protection system: By shunting, speed limiting and other technologies, the large-flow data packets are processed in a decentralized manner to avoid large-scale attacks on the network. Suitable network security products: 1. Yundun Anti-DDoS Pro IP: The DDoS attack protection product launched by Alibaba Cloud can block and clean target IPs. It adopts multi-dimensional, multi-strategy and multi-level protection system to effectively deal with various attack methods and methods. 2. Cloud lock DDoS attack defense system: specially aimed at high-efficiency and large-traffic DDoS attacks, using centralized cleaning or distributed traffic cleaning, etc., can defend up to hundreds of Gbps or even more than TB-level attacks. It is a very powerful DDoS defense solution .
