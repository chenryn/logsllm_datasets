User: Explain what DNS resolution is, and provide a public DNS resolution service address.
Assistant: DNS resolution is the process of converting domain names into IP addresses so that users can access websites or other network services through them. When a user enters a domain name in a browser, the computer needs to find the IP address corresponding to that domain name. This process is called DNS resolution, and it involves querying a DNS server for the corresponding IP address. The public DNS resolution service addresses are: 1. Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 2. CloudFlare DNS: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 3. OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 4. Quad9 DNS: 9.9. 9.9 and 149.112.112.112
