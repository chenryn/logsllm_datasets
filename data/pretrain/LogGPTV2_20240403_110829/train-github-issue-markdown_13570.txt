For the past two days, we have encountered a series of failed builds in the master branch, despite pull requests (PRs) appearing to function correctly. The issue is evident in the latest four commits, as shown below:

- [Build 17721](https://circleci.com/gh/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/17721)
- [Build 17765](https://circleci.com/gh/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/17765)
- [Build 17776](https://circleci.com/gh/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/17776)
- [Build 17789](https://circleci.com/gh/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/17789)

The error message for each of these builds is consistent:
```
rewrite dev/searchindex.js (73%)
ERROR: The key you are authenticating with has been marked as read-only.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights and that the repository exists.
Exited with code 128
```

To resolve this, it appears that a restart may be necessary to pass the build. However, I have not found any relevant information on CircleCI regarding this specific issue. Therefore, I am posting here to seek assistance.

@jnothman @lesteve, could you please take a look at this?
