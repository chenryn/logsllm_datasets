User: Recently I've found myself testing an aplication in Froglogic's Squish, using Python to create test scripts. Just the other day, the question of how much memory the program is using has come up, and I've found myself unable to answer it.
It seems reasonable to assume that there's a way to query the os (windows 7) API for the information, but I've no idea where to begin. Does anyone know how I'd go about this?
Assistant: In command line: tasklist /FO LIST and parse the results?
Sorry, I don't know a Pythonic way. =P
