User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题The Job and Monitoring Options of RoboCopy What does the Job Options of RoboCopy do? And what exactly does the /MON and /MOT switches do? How can I use them? I don't understand them, and can't find any examples on how to use them.


  
  /MON:n - MONitor source; run again when more than n changes seen.
  /MOT:m - MOnitor source; run again in m minutes Time, if changed.
  


Does this mean that it will run one time first and then keep running after it finishes and run again if a change happens somewhere down in the filestructure or when something have changed and a time has passed?


  
  /JOB:jobname - take parameters from the named JOB file.
  /SAVE:jobname - SAVE parameters to the named job file
  /QUIT - QUIT after processing command line (to view parameters).
  /NOSD - NO Source Directory is specified.
  /NODD - NO Destination Directory is specified.
  /IF - Include the following Files.
  


What is a job file? What is the /NOSD and /NODD switches for?

Assistant: Best explained by example:

Here's a trivial job file, call it sample.rcj:

:: Source Directory :
    /SD:C:\Documents and Settings\  :: Source Directory.

:: Destination Directory :
::  On command line

:: Copy options :
    /E      :: copy Subdirectories, including empty ones.


It specifies options to copy the c:\Documents and Settings directory of the current machine to an unspecified location.

Here's how you'd use it to copy to the destination specified in the %DEST% environment variable, adding logging to the %LOG% file.

robocopy /nosd %DEST% /log+:%LOG% /job:sample


/NOSD is given because the source is specified in the job file.

You can play around with creating a robocopy command on the command line, then when you're happy it's doing what you want, run it again with /SAVE to save the options to a file.

/QUIT parses the options and will complain if you've got something wrong (invalid options, source doesn't exist) but doesn't actually do anything.

I would guess that /IF would let you include a file of options in addition to the job itself? (In my example, I could have put the /LOG option in a file and included it with /IF.)  Just guessing there, though.
