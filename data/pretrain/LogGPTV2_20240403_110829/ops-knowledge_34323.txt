User: Generate a script that uses python to connect to a linux host
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script that can be used to connect to a Linux host: python import paramiko # Set connection parameters hostname = '192.168.1.100' port = 22 username = 'username' password = 'password' # Create an SSH client client = paramiko.SSHClient() # Automatically add missing host keys client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) # Connect to remote host client.connect(hostname, port, username=username, password=password) # Execute remote command stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls -l') # output the command result print(stdout.read().decode('utf-8')) # close the connection client.close() ``` in this example , we used the paramiko library to create an SSH client and connect to a remote Linux host using the provided connection parameters. Then, we use the exec_command method to execute the remote command (ls -l in this example), and stdout.read() to read the command's standard output. Finally, we close the connection for safety.
