ber 2013, a San Francisco man by the name of Ross
Ulbricht was arrested and charged as being the opera-
tor of Silk Road [8]. A large amount of data was sub-
sequently entered into evidence used during his trial,
which took place in January 2015. In particular, evidence
contained relatively detailed accounting entries found on
Mr. Ulbricht’s laptop, and claimed to pertain to Silk
Road. Chat transcripts (evidence GX226A, GX227C)
place weekly volumes at $475,000/week in late March
2012 for instance: this is consistent with the data previ-
ously reported [13] and which we use for documenting
Silk Road. Evidence GX250 contains a personal ledger

which apparently faithfully documents Silk Road sales
commissions. Projecting the data listed during the time
of the previous study [13] ($680,279) over a year yields
a yearly projection of about $1.2M; Christin’s estimates
were of $1.1M [13]. This hints that the technique of us-
ing feedback as a sales proxy, which we reuse here, pro-
duces reliable estimates.
Blake Benthall criminal complaint (Silk Road 2)
In
November 2014, another San Francisco man by the name
of Blake Benthall was arrested and charged with being
“Defcon,” the Silk Road 2.0 administrator. The crim-
inal complaint against Mr. Benthall [7] reports that in
September 2014, the administrator, talking to an under-
cover agent actually working on Silk Road 2’s staff, re-
ports around $6M of monthly sales; and later amends this
number to $8M. This corresponds to a daily sales volume
of $200,000–$250,000 which is very close to what we re-
port in Figure 5 for Silk Road 2 at that given time.
Leaked Agora seller page
In December 2014, it was
revealed that an Agora vendor page had been scraped and
leaked on Pastebin [21]. This vendor page in particular
contains a subset of all the vendor’s transactions; one can
estimate precisely the amount for that speciﬁc vendor on
June 5, 2014 to $3,460. Checking in our database, our
instantaneous estimate credits that seller with $3,408 on
the day – which, considering Bitcoin exchange ﬂuctua-
tions is pretty much identical to the ground truth.
5.2 Ethics of data collection
We share much of the ethical concerns and views docu-
mented in previous work [13]. Our data collection, in
particular, is massive, and could potentially put some
strain on the Tor network, not to mention marketplace
servers themselves. However, even though it is hard
to assess we believe that our measurements represent a
small fraction of all trafﬁc that is going to online anony-
mous marketplaces. As discussed in Section 3 we are at-
tempting to balance accuracy of the data collection with a
light-weight enough crawling strategy to avoid detection
– or worse, impacting the very operations we are trying to
measure. In addition, we are contributing Tor relays with
long uptimes on very fast networks to “compensate” for
our own massive use of the network. Our work takes a
number of steps to remain neutral. We certainly do not
want to facilitate vendor or marketplace operator arrests.
This is not just an ethical question, but is also a scientiﬁc
one: our measurements, to be sound, should not impact
the subject(s) being measured [23].
5.3 Public-policy take-aways
The main outcome of this work, we hope, is a criti-
cal evaluation of meaningful public policy toward online
anonymous marketplaces. While members of Congress
have routinely called for the take down of “brazen” on-
line marketplaces, it is unclear that this is the most prag-
matic use of taxpayer money.
In fact, our measurements suggest that the ecosystem
appears quite resilient to law enforcement take-downs.
We see this without ambiguity in response to the (origi-
nal) Silk Road take-down; and while it is too early to tell
the long-lasting impacts of Operation Onymous, its main
effect so far seems to have been to consolidate transac-
tions in the two dominant marketplaces at the time of the
take-down. More generally, economics tell us that be-
cause user demand for drugs online is present (and quite
massive), enterprising individuals will seemingly always
be interested in accommodating this demand.
A natural question is whether the cat-and-mouse game
between law enforcement and marketplace operators
could end with the complete demise of online anony-
mous marketplaces. Our results suggest it is unlikely.
Thus, considering the expenses incurred in very lengthy
investigations and the level of international coordination
needed in operations like Operation Onymous, the time
may be ripe to investigate alternative solutions.
Reducing demand through prevention is certainly an
alternative worth exploring on a global public policy
level, but, from a law enforcement perspective, even ac-
tive intervention could be much more targeted, e.g., to-
ward seizing highly dangerous products while in transit.
A number of documented successes in using traditional
police work against sellers of hazardous substances (e.g.,
[35]) or large-scale dealers (e.g., [4, 6] among many oth-
ers) show that law enforcement is not powerless to ad-
dress the issue in the physical world.
6 Related work
The past decade has seen a large number of detailed re-
search efforts aiming at gathering actual measurements
from various online criminal ecosystems in order to de-
vise meaningful defenses; see, e.g., [13,14,22,26,27,28,
29,32,40,41]. Anderson et al. [11] and Thomas et al. [37]
provide a very good overview of the ﬁeld. Closest among
these papers to our work, McCoy et al. obtained detailed
measurements of online pharmaceutical afﬁliates, show-
ing that individual networks grossed between USD 12.8
million/year to USD 67.7 million/year. In comparison,
the long-term rough average we see here is in the order of
$150–180M/year for the entire online anonymous mar-
ketplace ecosystem. In other words, online marketplaces
have seemingly surpassed more “traditional” ways of de-

With respect
to speciﬁc measurements of online
anonymous marketplaces, the present paper builds up
on our previous work [13]. Surprisingly few other ef-
forts exist attempting to quantitatively characterize the
economics of online anonymous marketplaces. Of note,
Aldridge and D´ecary-H´etu [10] complement our original
volume estimates by showing revised numbers of around
$90M/year for Silk Road in 2013 right before its take-
down. This is roughly in line with our own measure-
ments, albeit slightly more conservative (Figure 5 shows
about $300K/day for Silk Road in summer 2013.) More
recent work by Dolliver [17] tries to assess the volumes
on Silk Road 2.0. While she does not report volumes, her
seller numbers are far smaller than ours, and we suspect
her scrapes might have been incomplete. Looking at the
problem from a different angle, Meiklejohn et al. [31]
provide a detailed analysis of transaction traceability in
the Bitcoin network, and show which addresses are re-
lated to Silk Road, which in turn could be a useful way of
assessing the total volumes of that marketplace. A follow
up paper [30] shows that purported Bitcoin “anonymity”
(i.e., unlinkability) is greatly overstated, even when us-
ing newer mixing primitives.
On the customer side, Barratt et al. [12] provide an
insightful survey of Silk Road patrons, showing that a
lot of them associate with the “party culture,” which is
corroborated by our results showing that cannabis and
ecstasy correspond to roughly half of the sales; like-
wise Van Hout and Bingham provide valuable insights
into individual participants [39]. Our research comple-
ments these efforts by providing a macro-level view of
the ecosystem.
7 Conclusions
Even though anonymous online marketplaces are a rel-
atively recent development in the overall online crime
ecosystem, our longitudinal measurements show that in
the short four years since the development of the original
Silk Road, total volumes have reached up to $650,000
daily (averaged over 30-day windows) and are generally
stable around $300,000-$500,000 a day, far exceeding
what had been previously reported. More remarkably,
anonymous marketplaces are extremely resilient to take-
downs and scams – highlighting the simple fact that eco-
nomics (demand) plays a dominant role. In light of our
ﬁndings, we suggest a re-evaluation of intervention poli-
cies against anonymous marketplaces. Given the high
demand for the products being sold, it is not clear that
take-downs will be effective; at least we have found no
evidence they were. Even if one went to the impracti-
cal extreme of banning anonymous networks, demand
would probably simply move to other channels, while
some of the beneﬁts associated with these markets (e.g.,
reduction in risks of violence at the retail level) would be
lost. Instead, a focus on reducing consumer demand, e.g.,
through prevention, might be worth considering; like-
wise, it would be well-worth investigating whether more
targeted interventions (e.g., at the seller level) have had
measurable effects on the overall ecosystem. While our
paper does not answer these questions, we believe that
the data collection methodology we described, as well as
some of the data we have collected, may enable further
research in the ﬁeld.
