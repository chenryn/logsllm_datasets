Given this rust:
    class apple {
        let one_field_is_required: int;
        new() {
            self.one_field_is_required = 0;
            for [1,2,3].each |_x| {}
            // let _dummy = 4;
        }
    }
    fn main() {
    }
rustc fails with:
    test.rs:7:8: 7:32 error: mismatched types: expected `apple` but found `()` (class apple vs ())
    test.rs:7         for [1,2,3].each |_x| {}
                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    error: aborting due to previous error
This is pretty wierd. Its like rustc thinks the for loop is an implicit return
expression.
Un-commenting the `let _dummy = 4;` line makes the code compile as expected.
