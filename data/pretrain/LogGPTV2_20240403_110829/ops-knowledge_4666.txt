User: What's the best way to monitor a python daemon to determine the cause of it quitting unexpectedly? Is strace my best option or is there something Python specific that does the job?
Assistant: I would generally start by adding logging to it. At a minimum, have whatever is launching it capture stdout/stderr so that any stack traces are saved. Examine your except blocks to make sure you're not capturing exceptions silently.
