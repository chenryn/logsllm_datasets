User: According to the network architecture diagram, design a secure network access control scheme. Give a specific network architecture diagram.
Assistant: Design a secure network access control scheme based on a given network architecture diagram. The plan is as follows: 1. Establish a network security strategy Formulate a network security strategy, clarify the purpose and scope of network access control, clarify the threats and risks that may arise from network access, and establish corresponding security protection measures. 2. Use network firewall for access control Install a network firewall, set access control rules according to the network architecture diagram, only allow authorized IP addresses, ports and protocol access, and prevent unauthorized access and attacks. 3. Use network encryption technology According to the requirements of the network architecture diagram, use encryption technology such as VPN to realize safe remote access. 4. Establish a secure password policy According to the requirements of the network architecture diagram, formulate a secure password policy, requiring users to choose safe passwords, change passwords regularly, and limit the number of password accesses and login failures to avoid password leakage and brute force cracking. 5. Application of access control technology According to the requirements of the network architecture diagram, use access control technology to carry out fine authority management according to different user roles and permissions, and realize efficient access control. 6. Regularly audit network security According to the requirements of the network architecture diagram, regularly audit network access, record access logs, discover potential security threats, and take timely measures to defend and ensure network security. 7. Conduct regular security training According to the requirements of the network architecture diagram, provide security training for network users to enhance their security awareness and knowledge, improve users' self-protection ability, and reduce security loopholes and risks.
