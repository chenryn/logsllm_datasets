User: In order to improve the performance of web applications, we consider some file compression and code optimization. Please provide some feasible solutions and tools, as well as the scope of application and points for attention.
Assistant: 1. Compress HTML, CSS and JavaScript file solutions: use compression tools, such as HTMLMinifier, CSSNano, UglifyJS, etc. Scope of application: Suitable for any web application. Note: The compressed file is difficult to read and debug, and the original file needs to be backed up. 2. Reduce HTTP request scheme: combine multiple small files into one large file. Combine multiple CSS files using CSS Sprites. Scope of application: Suitable for any web application. Points to note: The merged file may become larger, due to shared code between multiple files, resulting in some code duplication. 3. Use a caching solution: use browser caching to reduce server requests. A permanent HTTP redirect can be used so that the browser downloads the file from the new location. Static files can be checked and refreshed periodically. Scope of application: Suitable for any web application, especially some applications where users stay on the same page for a long time. Points to note: When a file changes on the server side, the browser cache needs to be cleared to ensure the user gets the latest version. 4. Image compression scheme: Use image compression tools, such as ImageOptim, TinyPNG, etc. Scope of application: suitable for any web application, especially the arrangement and image categories. Note: When using high-quality images, the degree of compression must be considered. Lesser ratios may result in significant loss of purpose. 5. Code review solution: Use code review tools for JavaScript and CSS code, such as JSLint, JSHint, CSSLint, etc. Scope of application: Suitable for any web application. A word of caution: While these tools can inspect your code, they don't automatically fix code errors. 6. Lazy loading scheme: Load other content, such as images or JavaScript, after the main content is used. Applicability: Applies to which pages of the site have "above the fold" (what the user needs to see right away). Note: Lazily loaded objects will be displayed when the user scrolls to the lower part of the page. If the user does not scroll the page, the object may not be displayed. 7. Solution for processing and sending JSON data: use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Some server-side programs support gzip compressed JSON format, which can reduce transmission time. Scope of application: Suitable for AJAX and distributed web applications. Note: JSON support and corresponding compression services need to be configured on the server. 8. Reasonable use of CDN solutions: Using CDN services can reduce transmission time and improve web user experience. Put static files on a CDN server. Scope of application: Suitable for any web application, especially websites and web services that are slow or unstable. Points to note: Different CDN service providers have different quality and reliability. It is necessary to evaluate the reputation and certificates of CDN service providers and various Internet connection providers.
