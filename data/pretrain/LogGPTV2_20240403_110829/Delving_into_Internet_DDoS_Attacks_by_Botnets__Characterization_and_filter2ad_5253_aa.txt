Abstract—Internet Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) at-
tacks are prevalent but hard to defend against, partially due
to the volatility of the attacking methods and patterns used by
attackers. Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide new
insights for effective defense. But most of existing understandings
are based on indirect trafﬁc measures (e.g., backscatters) or trafﬁc
seen locally. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis based
on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed in a
seven-month period. These attacks were launched by 674 botnets
from 23 different botnet families with a total of 9,026 victim IPs
belonging to 1,074 organizations in 186 countries. Our analysis
reveals several interesting ﬁndings about today’s Internet DDoS
attacks. Some highlights include: (1) geolocation analysis shows
that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows
certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction
of future attacks for most active botnet families; (2) from the
target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit
strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate
start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain
botnet families; (3) there is a trend for different botnets to
launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously
or in turn. These ﬁndings add to the existing literature on the
understanding of today’s Internet DDoS attacks, and offer new
insights for designing new defense schemes at different levels.

INTRODUCTION
Today, Internet Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)
attacks are prevalent with the ease of access to large numbers
of infected machines, collectively called botnets. According
to a recent report [1], the duration, intensity, and diversity
of attacks are on the rise: a year-over-year analysis shows
that the average DDoS attack size has increased by 245% in
the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to the same quarter of
2013, and by 14% from the previous quarter of the same year,
with an average attack of 7.39 Gbps. Furthermore, the same
report shows that all industry verticals are targeted by attacks.
Another report reveals a clear increase in the average duration
of DDoS attacks from 60 minutes in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014 to
72 minutes in second quarter of the same year, which translates
to 20% increase [2]. Additionally, recent DDoS attacks have
witnessed an uptrend in operational impact, size, and conse-
quences [3], [4], with the largest reported attacks exceeding
500 Gbps [5]. Today’s malicious actors are not limited to
sophisticated machines, like servers and personal computers;
recent DDoS attacks were reportedly utilizing fridges [6], and
other massive scanning activities were done using embedded
devices, including monitoring cameras and security doors [7].
Security researchers in academia and industry devoted
enormous efforts to understanding DDoS attacks and defend-
ing against them. As defenses are deployed, attacks evolved
and became more sophisticated to circumvent those defenses.
Understanding the current trends in today’s DDoS attacks
and their attack vectors is an important phase in devising
effective defenses. Existing studies in this regard are based
on indirect trafﬁc analyses and artifacts, such as backscatters,
or trafﬁc collected locally, or by inﬁltrating into a botnet. A
large scale view of today’s Internet DDoS attacks is missing
in the literature and calls for further investigation.
In this paper, we present our study of DDoS attacks
analysis. As most of the DDoS attacks nowadays are launched
by botnets, the dataset utilized in this study focuses on DDoS
attacks launched by various botnet families across the Internet.
In a seven-month period captured in our dataset, a total of
50,704 different DDoS attacks were observed, which were
launched by 674 different botnets coming from 23 different
botnet families. These attacks targeted 9,026 different IPs that
belong to 1,074 organizations in 186 countries.
Our detailed analyses revealed several interesting observa-
tions about today’s Internet botnet DDoS attacks. While details
are provided in the paper, some highlights include:
•
•
•
Geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distri-
bution of the attacking sources follows certain pat-
terns, which enables very accurate source prediction
of future attacks for most active botnet families.
From the target perspective, multiple attacks to the
same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack
time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction
of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet
families.
There is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS
attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or
in turn.
These ﬁndings offer new insights for designing effective
and/or customized defense schemes at different levels.
Organization. In Section II, we describe our dataset including
the overall data statistics and the data ﬁelds we utilized to
do our analysis. In Section III, we present an overview of
these DDoS attacks. In Section IV, we analyze the geolocation
afﬁnity of attacking sources and their targets. In Section V,
we present in depth collaboration analyses between different
botnets in a family or across families. We discuss related work
in Section VI and conclude with a concise summary of our
analyses and their implications in Section VII.

obtained using a highly-accurate geo-mapping service during
the trace collection. The mapping of the IP addresses is a real-
time process, making it resistive to IP dynamics. Beside the
longitude and latitude, we also generate the individual city and
organization of each IP address involved in an attack using
a highly-accurate commercial grade geo-mapping dataset by
Digital Envoy (Digital Element services [8]). We use such
information for geographical analysis as presented later.
Table II sums up some statistics of our dataset, includ-
ing information from both the attacker and the target sides.
Target statistics are illuminating. Over a period of 28 weeks,
50,704 different DDoS attacks were observed. These attacks
were launched by 674 different botnets. These attacks tar-
geted victims located in 84 different countries, 616 cities,
involving 1,074 organizations, and residing in 1,260 different
autonomous systems (ASes).

Attack Types
Fig. 1. Popularity of attack types
Attack mechanisms. Based on the trafﬁc type information,
Figure 1 shows the statistic of different protocols. Clearly, the
dominant protocol used in these attacks is HTTP, followed
by UDP and TCP. Table III further shows the breakdown
of transport types used by different botnet families. The last
column in the table shows the number of attacks belonging
to each type. Note that a botnet could utilize multiple attack
types. For example, Blackenergy supports different transport
mechanisms of attack trafﬁc,
including HTTP, TCP, UDP,
ICMP and SYN. The variety of transport mechanisms explains
the family’s popularity. Furthermore, the large share of HTTP
as means of transport in this family highlights the preferred
target of attacks, namely web services.
Comparison and limitations. A large body of the related
work [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] are on radiation and port scan-
ning measurements. However, most of that work is concerned
380380
reverse engineered, and labeled to a known malware family
using best practices. Hosts participating in the given botnet,
by communicating with pieces of infrastructure infected by
that malware family (e.g. the command and control) are then
enumerated and monitored over time, and their activities are
logged and analyzed.
Collection methodology. As each botnet evolves over time,
new generations are marked by their unique (MD5 and SHA-
1) hashes. Traces of trafﬁc associated with various botnets are
collected at various points on the Internet, in cooperation with
various ISPs. Trafﬁc logs are then analyzed to attribute and
characterize attacks. The collection and analysis are guided
by two general principles: 1) the source of the trafﬁc is an
infected host participating in a botnet attack, and 2) that the
destination of the trafﬁc is a targeted client, as concluded from
eavesdropping on command and control of the campaign using
a live malware samples.
By tracking temporal activities of 23 different known
botnet families, the dataset captures a snapshot of each family
every hour from 08/29/2012 to 03/24/2013, a total of 207 days,
or about seven months. There are 24 hourly reports per day
for each botnet family. The set of bots or controllers listed in
each report are cumulative over the past 24 hours. The 24-hour
time span is measured using the timestamp of the last known
bot activity and the time of logged snapshot.
The analysis is high level in nature to cope with the high
volume of ingest trafﬁc at peak attack times. As shown later,
on average, there was 243 simultaneous veriﬁed DDoS attacks
launched by the different botnets studied in this work. High
level statistics associated with the various botnets and DDoS
attacks are recorded every one hour. The workload we obtained
ranges from August 29, 2012 to March 24, 2013, a total of 207
days (about seven months of valid and marked attack logs). In
the log, each DDoS attack is labeled with a unique DDoS
identiﬁer, corresponding to an attack by given DDoS malware
family on a given target. Other attributes and statistics of the
dataset are shown in Table I.
Features and statistics. An interesting feature in Table I
is the attack category, which refers to the nature of the
DDoS attacks by classifying them into various types based on
the protocol utilized for launching them; HTTP, TCP, UDP,
Undetermined, ICMP, Unknown, and SYN. Different from
Unknown, Undetermined means that the attack type could not
be determined based on the available information.

with a single network (Tier-1 ISP [11], sinkhole trafﬁc [10],
[13]). On the other hand, our work is on DDoS attack
characterization at a larger scale. This fundamental difference
between our work and the prior literature makes it difﬁcult
to make direct comparisons between our work and the prior
literature.
Towards the limitations of our data collection, one may
argue that not covering all ISPs on the Internet for data
collection may bias our data, and thus our ﬁndings. We
note that; however, our data collection also incorporates at-
destination data collection, thus all statistics of interest are
gathered in the process. For the data size, and in comparison
to [11], our study characterizes more than 50,000 attacks over
seven months observation period (compared to 31,612 alarms
over a period of four weeks in the prior work). Note, the
fundamental difference between attacks and alarms is that a
large number of triggered alarms in anomaly detection systems
could be false alarms, while attacks are veriﬁed alarms
Note that our data collection method is not subject to the
shortcoming of locality bias highlighted in [12]: all malware
families used for launching attacks that we study are well-
understood at the time of the data collection and reversed
engineered, and trafﬁc sources utilized for launching the at-
tacks are enumerated by active measurement. To that end,
we believe that our data collection is representative to the
characterized events, and that the length of the observation
period is sufﬁcient to draw some conclusions on DDoS attacks
on the Internet today.
III. OVERVIEW OF DDOS ATTACKS
In this section, we present an overview of DDoS attacks
logged in our dataset. We recognize that not all of the 23
botnets logged in our dataset are active all the time. Among
them, 10 families are more active than others – a complete
analysis of all 23 botnet families can be found in [14]. To this
end, in this section we focus on analyzing and characterizing
attacks launched by those 10 active families. Namely, we
study the DDoS attacks launched by Aldibot, BlackEnergy,
Colddeath, Darkshell, DDoSer, DirtJumper, Nitol, Optima,
Pandora, and YZF.
In the 28 weeks covered in our dataset, we observed over
50, 000 DDoS attacks launched using bots that belong to the
10 active botnets. First we study the attack distribution along
time. To do this, we extract the beginning time of each attack
and plotted the aggregate number of attacks over the period of
28 weeks in Figure 2. In this ﬁgure, the y-axis represents the
number of different DDoS attacks, and the x-axis represents
the time (date). We ﬁnd that on average there are 243 DDoS
attacks launched by the 10 botnet families every day. The
maximum number of simultaneous DDoS attacks per day was
983 attacks, which happened on August 30, 2012. All of these
attacks were launched by Dirtjumper and the targets were
located in the same subnet in Russia, suggesting a strong
relationship between the different attacks.
Although we observe ﬂuctuations in the number of at-
tacks over time, we did not ﬁnd any obvious daily, weekly,
or monthly patterns in Figure 2 that are common in other
