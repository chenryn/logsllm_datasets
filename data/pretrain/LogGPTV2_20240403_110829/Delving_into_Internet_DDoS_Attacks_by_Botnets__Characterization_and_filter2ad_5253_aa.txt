## Abstract
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are prevalent and challenging to defend against, partly due to the dynamic nature of attack methods and patterns. Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide valuable insights for effective defense. However, most existing studies rely on indirect traffic measures or local observations. This study presents an in-depth analysis based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed over a seven-month period. These attacks were launched by 674 botnets from 23 different botnet families, targeting 9,026 victim IPs belonging to 1,074 organizations in 186 countries. Our analysis reveals several key findings:
1. Geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of attacking sources follows certain patterns, enabling accurate source prediction for future attacks.
2. Multiple attacks on the same target exhibit strong inter-attack time interval patterns, allowing for accurate start time prediction of subsequent attacks.
3. There is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, either simultaneously or sequentially.

These findings contribute to the existing literature on DDoS attacks and offer new insights for designing more effective and customized defense schemes at various levels.

## I. Introduction
Internet Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly prevalent, driven by the ease of access to large numbers of infected machines, collectively known as botnets. According to recent reports, the duration, intensity, and diversity of DDoS attacks are on the rise. For example, the average DDoS attack size increased by 245% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the same quarter in 2013, with an average attack size of 7.39 Gbps. Additionally, the average duration of DDoS attacks increased from 60 minutes in the first quarter of 2014 to 72 minutes in the second quarter, representing a 20% increase. Recent DDoS attacks have also seen an uptrend in operational impact, size, and consequences, with the largest reported attacks exceeding 500 Gbps. Modern malicious actors are not limited to sophisticated machines; recent DDoS attacks have even utilized fridges and other embedded devices like monitoring cameras and security doors.

Security researchers in academia and industry have made significant efforts to understand and defend against DDoS attacks. As defenses are deployed, attackers evolve and develop more sophisticated methods to circumvent them. Understanding current trends in DDoS attacks and their vectors is crucial for devising effective defenses. Existing studies often rely on indirect traffic analyses, such as backscatters, or locally collected data. A comprehensive, large-scale view of today's Internet DDoS attacks is still lacking in the literature.

In this paper, we present a detailed study of DDoS attacks. Our dataset focuses on DDoS attacks launched by various botnet families across the Internet. Over a seven-month period, we observed 50,704 different DDoS attacks launched by 674 different botnets from 23 different botnet families, targeting 9,026 different IPs belonging to 1,074 organizations in 186 countries.

Our detailed analyses reveal several interesting observations about today's Internet botnet DDoS attacks:
- Geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of attacking sources follows certain patterns, enabling accurate source prediction for future attacks.
- From the target perspective, multiple attacks on the same target exhibit strong inter-attack time interval patterns, allowing for accurate start time prediction of subsequent attacks.
- Different botnets tend to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, either simultaneously or sequentially.

These findings offer new insights for designing effective and customized defense schemes at various levels.

## II. Dataset Collection and Methodology
### Dataset
Our dataset was provided by a third-party through monitoring Internet infrastructures using both active and passive measurement techniques. For active measurements and attribution, malware families used in launching various attacks were reverse-engineered and labeled using best practices. Hosts participating in the given botnet, by communicating with pieces of infrastructure infected by that malware family (e.g., command and control), were enumerated and monitored over time, and their activities were logged and analyzed.

### Collection Methodology
As each botnet evolves over time, new generations are marked by their unique MD5 and SHA-1 hashes. Traffic associated with various botnets is collected at various points on the Internet in cooperation with ISPs. Traffic logs are then analyzed to attribute and characterize attacks. The collection and analysis are guided by two principles:
1. The source of the traffic is an infected host participating in a botnet attack.
2. The destination of the traffic is a targeted client, as concluded from eavesdropping on command and control of the campaign using live malware samples.

By tracking the temporal activities of 23 different known botnet families, the dataset captures a snapshot of each family every hour from August 29, 2012, to March 24, 2013, a total of 207 days, or about seven months. There are 24 hourly reports per day for each botnet family, with the set of bots or controllers listed in each report being cumulative over the past 24 hours. High-level statistics associated with the various botnets and DDoS attacks are recorded every hour.

### Features and Statistics
Table I summarizes the fields in our dataset, including the unique identification of each DDoS attack, the botnet ID, the category of the attack, the target IP, the start and end times of the attack, the IP addresses of the botnets involved, the autonomous system number (ASN), the country, city, and the latitude and longitude of the target.

Table II provides a summary of the workload information, including the number of bot IPs, cities, countries, organizations, ASNs, DDoS IDs, botnet IDs, and traffic types.

Figure 1 shows the popularity of different attack types, with HTTP being the dominant protocol, followed by UDP and TCP. Table III further breaks down the transport types used by different botnet families, highlighting the variety of mechanisms employed.

### Comparison and Limitations
While many related works focus on radiation and port scanning measurements, they are often limited to a single network (e.g., Tier-1 ISP, sinkhole traffic). In contrast, our work characterizes DDoS attacks on a larger scale, making direct comparisons with prior literature challenging. Our data collection method, which incorporates at-destination data collection, ensures that all relevant statistics are gathered. Despite potential biases, we believe our data collection is representative and sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions about DDoS attacks on the Internet today.

## III. Overview of DDoS Attacks
In this section, we present an overview of the DDoS attacks logged in our dataset. Not all of the 23 botnets logged in our dataset are active all the time. Among them, 10 families are more active than others. We focus on analyzing and characterizing attacks launched by these 10 active families: Aldibot, BlackEnergy, Colddeath, Darkshell, DDoSer, DirtJumper, Nitol, Optima, Pandora, and YZF.

Over the 28 weeks covered in our dataset, we observed over 50,000 DDoS attacks launched by bots belonging to these 10 active botnets. We first study the attack distribution over time. Figure 2 plots the aggregate number of attacks over the 28-week period, showing that, on average, there are 243 DDoS attacks launched by the 10 botnet families every day. The maximum number of simultaneous DDoS attacks per day was 983, which occurred on August 30, 2012, and were all launched by Dirtjumper, targeting the same subnet in Russia, suggesting a strong relationship between the different attacks.

Although we observe fluctuations in the number of attacks over time, no obvious daily, weekly, or monthly patterns are evident in Figure 2, which is common in other types of attacks.
