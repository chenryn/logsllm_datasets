User: Why use virtualization technology? Please provide a description of the underlying virtualization technology.
Assistant: Virtualization technology is mainly used to improve the utilization of hardware resources, simplify application deployment and management, and improve system availability and security. It divides multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a physical server, and each VM can independently run operating systems, applications and user environments, enabling multiple applications to run simultaneously on one server, improving server hardware utilization rate. Basic virtualization technologies include full virtualization and paravirtualization. Full virtualization refers to running a complete operating system in a virtual operating system, which uses a virtual machine monitoring program (Hypervisor) to divide physical server resources. Paravirtualization is optimized for a specific operating system, so that the operating system can recognize that it is running in a virtualized environment and directly access physical resources without the support of a virtual machine monitor. In addition, containerization technology is also a virtualization technology. Compared with traditional virtualization technology, it is lighter-weight. By using the kernel resources of the host operating system to run multiple container instances, it improves the operating efficiency and deployment flexibility of applications. sex.
