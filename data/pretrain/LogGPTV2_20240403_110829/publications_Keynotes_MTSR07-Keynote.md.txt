Abstract
B2B integration, also known as external IS integration and e-business integration, has promised to
automate and integrate business processes and interactions between companies by considerably
renovating the way business is conducted with partners, suppliers, and customers. B2B integration is
fundamentally about data and information exchange among businesses and their information systems.
One simple solution that organizations have adopted to reach a higher level of integration relied on the
use of XML as the language to represent data. Today it is estimated that most organizations use XML to
store and transfer data. Unfortunately, XML only provides syntax to structure the data exchanged in a B2B
setting, since tags have no predefined meaning. This is only one level of interoperability that must be met
in B2B transactions. Developers are still faced with the problem of semantic interoperability, i.e., the
difficulty to integrate resources that were developed using different vocabularies and different
perspectives on the data.
In order to overcome the limitation of using a syntactic B2B integration, the Semantic Web and its
associated technologies promise to offer a valuable solution to semantic B2B integration. This keynote
discusses architectural solutions that allows organizations to participate in B2B transaction using syntactic
protocols (i.e. XML) while representing their internal vocabularies and documents semantically (using
OWL). Partners and suppliers can freely exchange syntactic documents. Once an organization receives a
syntactic document it is allowed to create a mapping between the elements from the document and
concepts of an ontology that describes the domain of discourse of the organization (i.e., internal
vocabulary). The organization that receives the documents can create any number of mappings. The
mappings are stored in a local repository and can be reused when new, unseen, syntactic documents
arrive. When a new syntactic document is received by an organization, the repository is queried to
determine if some of the syntactic elements have already been mapped to ontological concepts in the
past.
Short biography
Jorge Cardoso (http://www.dme.uma.pt/jcardoso) joined the University of Madeira
(Portugal) in March 2003. He previously gave lectures at University of Georgia (USA) and at
the Instituto Politécnico de Leiria (Portugal). Dr. Cardoso received his Ph.D. in Computer
Science from the University of Georgia in 2002 (with Amit Sheth). While at the University of
Georgia, he was part of the LSDIS Lab. where he did extensive research on workflow
management systems. In 1999, he worked at the Boeing Company on enterprise application
integration with Christoph Bussler. Dr. Cardoso was the co-organizer and co-chair of the
First, Second, and Third International Workshop on Semantic and Dynamic Web Processes. He has
published over 60 refereed papers in the areas of workflow management systems, semantic Web, and
related fields. He has also edited 3 books on semantic Web and Web services. He is on the Editorial Board
of the Enterprise Information Systems Journal, the International Journal on Semantic Web and
Information systems, and the International Journal of Information Technology. He is also member of the
Editorial Advisory Review Board of Idea Group Inc. Prior to joining the University of Georgia, he worked
for two years at CCG, Zentrum für Graphische Datenverarbeitung, where is did research on Computer
Supported Cooperative Work.
