TRACKING THE SKY SPIES
How do we more generally detect surveillance aircraft and
activity?
Registrations can be changed and obscured
Many surveillance technologies are commercially available
How much surveillance is happening in other parts of the world?
Technical and operational requirements dictate ight patterns
Surveillance ights look very dierent from most other trac
HOW DO WE TRACK AIRCRAFT?
Radar is not practical
ADS-B messages are the way to go
Active community of radio / aviation / hacking enthusiasts collect
ADS-B data
Requires a Raspberry Pi 1B+, an RTL-SDR radio, antenna, and
internet connection
Multiple aggregators collect data
FlightRadar24.com, FlightAware.com, adsbexchange.com
FAA regulations require an increasing number of aircraft to
transmit ADS-B
Part of the "NextGen" program
Similar regulations in .EU, .IN, .AU, elsewhere
ADS-B DATA
Aircraft transmit a beacon signal with a unique ICAO number
Positions can be calculated with multilateration
Compare time dierence of messages arriving at multiple
receivers
Requires 4+ receivers for accurate calculation
Aggregator networks collect feeds from ADS-B receivers and
calculate aircraft positions
Some aircraft also transmit additional information: (latitude /
longitude), call sign, etc.
Currently not required, and location may not be accurate
LIMITATIONS TO DATA
Major commercial ight tracking sites augment their data with
FAA radar data
This data comes with restrictions that tracking sites do not publish
positions of aircraft on the FAA's ASDI block list
Bulk access to data is limited or expensive
ADS-B Exchange is an exception
Does not use FAA data, does not censor ights
Provides free access to live & historical data
Data challenges

PICKING SURVEILLANCE FLIGHTS FROM A
FIREHOSE OF DATA
There are over 80,000 ights a day
At any given time 8,000~13,000 aircraft are in the air
Most of these are not surveillance ights
How do we pick out the surveillance ights?
SURVEILLANCE FLIGHTS VS. OTHERS
Most non-surveillance trac goes from point A to B as quickly and
directly as possible
Minimizes ying over populated areas and crossing in to airports'
controlled airspace
Exceptions - holding patterns, ight schools, aerial surveys
TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS OF SURVEILLANCE
FLIGHTS
Technical and economic constraints result in relatively unique
ight patterns for surveillance
Cell site simulators - range of ~2 miles
FLIR (infrared) cameras
Surveillance ights often take o and land at the same airport
Cover densely populated metro areas
Visual surveillance - needs daylight
Electronic surveillance - cover of night preferred
Altitude "sweet spot"
PATTERN BASED DETECTION
Surveillance ights make a large number of turns
Most ights with 30+ turns "look" like surveillance ights
Limitations & future improvement
SURVEILLANCE SCORE METHODOLOGY
Calculate headings of each aircraft and increase the score each
time it changes > 90 degrees
Conditional based on altitude
Sweet spot is appx. 6,000 - 12,000 ft
Future renements:
Consider proximity to airports and controlled airspace (needs
good airspace data, may be compute intensive)
Score based on aircraft model
Additional geometric calulations to lter out survey activity
Compare ights to interesting geography -- borders, events, etc.
IMPLEMENTATION
Virtual Radar Server (
) with
connection to adsbexchange.com 's live data feed
Analysis / tracking code to be released today pulls ight trails from
local Virtual Radar Server JSON endpoint
Flight data queued in RabbitMQ and composed in Redis
Uses multiple cores and ight analysis can be distributed to
multiple machines
Completed ights stored for retrospective analysis
Flight paths for each suspicious aircraft exported as JSON les
Upload to object storage (AWS S3)
Viewable in a basic leaet.js web map

EXAMPLE
CONCLUSION
Many surveillance technologies improve with Moore's Law
Policies and oversight have not moved as quickly
You can work on tracking spy planes
Use, fork, and improve our application
Set up your own receiver and feed to adsbexchange.com and any
future open ADS-B aggregators
