### Constructing Profiles of Origin-Destination Pairs in a Single ISP Network

The construction of profiles for the rate history of origin-destination (OD) pairs in a single ISP network is a common approach. ACC (or Pushback) [40] utilizes the flow aggregate rates at intermediate routers to detect and mitigate attacks. Anomaly detection [37] monitors unusual changes in the entropy of packet header bits to identify attack traffic. However, all these attack-profiling approaches can be circumvented by an adversary who can freely choose attack sources, destinations, and protocols while fully conforming to network protocols (e.g., TCP congestion control).

### Proof-of-Work Defense Approaches

Proof-of-work mechanisms require target routers or servers to force both bots and legitimate senders to submit proofs (e.g., computational resources for solving puzzles [42], [55] or network bandwidth resources [54]) before allowing access. These systems differ from SPIFFY for several reasons:
1. **Traffic Limitation**: Proof-of-work systems limit the traffic generation of both legitimate senders and bots, whereas SPIFFY limits only bot traffic.
2. **Resource Utilization**: Proof-of-work systems create significant waste of computational and bandwidth resources at traffic sources, which may be prohibitive for energy- or bandwidth-constrained devices. In contrast, SPIFFY does not waste unnecessary resources.
3. **Infrastructure Changes**: Proof-of-work systems necessitate substantial modifications to the current Internet infrastructure, including senders, routers, end-servers, and protocols. SPIFFY, on the other hand, does not require such modifications.

### Capacity-Provisioning Defense Approaches

Instead of distinguishing between attack and legitimate traffic, the target network could provide more bandwidth through physical additions or traffic engineering. However, this approach has limitations:
1. **Cost Asymmetry**: It does not reduce the cost asymmetry between attackers and defenders. For example, if the target network provisions N times the bandwidth, the attacker needs to increase their attack bandwidth by the same factor (N) to succeed.
2. **Limited Bandwidth**: If bandwidth is provisioned via traffic engineering, the additional available bandwidth in typical ISP networks is very small (e.g., 2-4 times), as shown in our evaluation in Section VII.

### Collaboration-Based Defense Approaches

These mechanisms require global collaboration among networks under different ownership. CoDef [38] requires coordination between the attack-target ISP and the ISPs hosting traffic sources to mitigate attack traffic. SENSS [10] assumes collaboration between the target ISP and intermediate ISPs to control incoming flooding traffic. Although ISP collaboration is generally not readily available due to competitive relationships, increasing interest in ISP collaboration for DDoS defense (e.g., IETF DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Working Group [41]) may make these mechanisms feasible in the near future.

### SDN-Based DDoS Defense Approaches

Recent proposals have utilized SDN-based network architectures to handle DDoS attacks, such as Bohatei [23]. However, these approaches focus on elastic scaling for legacy DDoS attacks and do not address the link-flooding attacks considered in this paper.

### Other DDoS Attacks

While our primary focus is on link-flooding attacks targeting the Internet core, we also consider other DDoS attacks:
1. **Opt-Ack Attacks**: These attacks send TCP Ack packets with sequence numbers that the receiver (attacker) has not yet received, causing servers to send at a high rate without noticing network congestion. Such high-rate flows can be detected by existing "elephant" detection mechanisms [34].
2. **TCP Amplification Attacks**: These exploit protocol and implementation vulnerabilities in the TCP connection setup to amplify attack traffic volume. High-rate attack flows can be detected similarly to opt-ack attacks.
3. **Shrew Attacks**: These create low-rate flows with bursts of packets, causing synchronized TCP timeouts at a targeted link. These attacks are different from volumetric DDoS attacks and can be handled by dedicated countermeasures [56].
4. **SDN Data-Control Channel Attacks**: These have different goals from link-flooding attacks and need to be addressed independently [50].

### Conclusion

Handling Internet link-flooding attacks is challenging because adversaries can generate indistinguishable attack flows and incur lower costs than defenders. SPIFFY forces adversaries to choose between bot detection or increased attack costs, effectively removing the key enabler of undetectable, low-cost attacks. This provides a first-line defense against cost-sensitive adversaries, reducing the need for more complex and expensive collaborative defenses.
