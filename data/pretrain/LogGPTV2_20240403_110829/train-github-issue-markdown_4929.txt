**Current behavior:**
  * Switch to "latest" version of docs
  * click on the `docs` link at the top of the page (for example, to switch between the `manual` and `standard library` docs
  * The docs pages revert back to `1.0`
**Expected behavior:**
  * Once the docs are switched to `latest`, all links should only refer to `latest` . And vice-versa
  * All pages to show somewhere which version of the documentation is being viewed. Currently it is only seen in the URL
