User:  Explain what database load balancing is, and discuss some technical means to achieve load balancing.
Assistant: Database load balancing is to balance the load among multiple database servers to achieve the purpose of improving the performance and availability of the database system. Its main purpose is to enable multiple servers to cooperate better by allocating requests, jointly process requests, reduce the load pressure on a single server, and improve the performance of the entire database system. Commonly used technical means to achieve database load balancing include: 1. Vertically separated implementation: different services or tables are isolated in different servers, and automatically allocated according to the server's ability to process requests. 2. Horizontal separation implementation: Divide the same table in the database into several blocks, store each block in a different server, and dynamically allocate data blocks according to business needs to meet requests. 3. Implementation of load balancing server: introduce a load balancing server to distribute requests to different servers to improve the processing speed and efficiency of the entire system, and perform dynamic task assignment and load balancing based on performance judgments. 4. Cluster implementation: copy the database server and join the cluster, so as to realize automatic failover and backup while sharing the load. 5. Implementation of concurrency control technology: multiple servers are used to process the same transaction, load balancing is achieved through concurrency control technologies such as authorization mechanism and locks, and data consistency and transaction isolation are guaranteed at the same time.
