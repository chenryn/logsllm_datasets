 **Migrated issue, originally created by Marcin Jabrzyk (@bzyx)**
Just tried to create URI connection string where user have password with '+'
character, SQLAlchemy gives no clue in error and connecting to database using
psql works fine.  
Example URI:  
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI =
"postgresql+psycopg2://user:user+@somehosy.somedomain.com:5432/some_db"
Output:  
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (OperationalError) FATAL: password
authentication failed for user "user"  
FATAL: password authentication failed for user "user"  
None None
Changing password to not having '+' works fine.
