The documentation for neo4j 2.3.2 says:
"CREATE UNIQUE is in the middle of MATCH and CREATE — it will match what it
can, and create what is missing. CREATE UNIQUE will always make the least
change possible to the graph — if it can use parts of the existing graph, it
will." (http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/query-create-unique.html)
This seems inaccurate, or at least confusing. There are several StackOverflow
threads where people say that CREATE UNIQUE doesn't follow the "least change
possible" rule:
