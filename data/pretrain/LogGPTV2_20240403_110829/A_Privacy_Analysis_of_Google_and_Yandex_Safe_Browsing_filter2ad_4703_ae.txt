## Related Work and Mitigations
To our knowledge, no prior work has studied Safe Browsing (SB) services from a privacy perspective. Given the purpose and similarity of these services, our work is closely related to web-search privacy. URLs visited by users and searched keywords can reveal extensive personal information [33]. Several solutions to improve web-search privacy, such as dummy requests [34], can be applied to SB. Firefox currently deploys dummy queries alongside real queries to GSB to enhance k-anonymity for single prefix matches. However, re-identification is still possible in cases of multiple prefix matches.

Another countermeasure involves redirecting full hash requests through an anonymizing proxy. The main limitation here is that the client must trust the proxy, which may keep server logs of user activity that can be subpoenaed.

To prevent information leakage, private information retrieval (PIR) [36] would be ideal, but existing PIR constructions cannot scale to the level required by SB [37, 38]. Therefore, we propose querying the server one-prefix-at-a-time. When a URL has multiple decompositions matching in the prefixes' database, the root node/decomposition is queried first. Meanwhile, the browser pre-fetches and crawls the targeted URL to find if it contains Type I URLs. If the response from GOOGLE or YANDEX is positive, a warning message is displayed. Otherwise, if Type I URLs exist, the browser can query the server for other prefixes, allowing GOOGLE and YANDEX to recover only the domain, not the full URL.

We developed a proof-of-concept implementation using SCRAPY [39], a popular web crawler. We configured the timeout parameters (DNS_TIMEOUT and DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT) to 30 seconds and measured the cost for 100 random URLs. Tests were performed on a 64-bit processor laptop with an Intel Core i7-4600U CPU at 2.10GHz, 4MB cache, 8GB RAM, and running Linux 3.13.0-36-generic. On average, fetching and processing a web page took 0.17 seconds (for pages without timeouts). This extra processing incurs no overhead when done in parallel while the client makes a full hash request to the SB server.

The crawler is configured to follow a restricted crawling strategy, recovering links only on the target web page. In our experiments, this strategy found Type I URLs in 90% of cases. A more thorough, albeit costlier, approach would involve crawling the SLD of the target URL, ensuring the crawler never errs but requiring roughly three times more time. This presents a trade-off between privacy and robustness.

## Conclusion
Safe Browsing services are valuable tools for fighting malware, phishing, and other online frauds. Unlike other vendors, GOOGLE and YANDEX have made efforts to make their services as private as possible. However, the effectiveness of their anonymization techniques is unclear. We quantified the privacy provided by these services and showed that hashing and truncation fail when the server receives multiple prefixes for certain classes of URLs.

Observations on the YANDEX database and, to a lesser extent, the GOOGLE database show that these databases can be tampered with, either deliberately or due to development errors/misconfigurations. This transforms the service into an invisible tracker embedded in several software solutions. Future work includes designing a plugin for Firefox and Chrome to raise awareness of associated privacy issues.
