lower bound δ on ∆GS − ∆G, Construction 2 complies M into a
sensitively private mechanism, Uδ (Theorem 4.7). We stress that
for the compiled SP mechanism, the probability of error can be
exponentially smaller compared to the input DP mechanism. which
is especially true for the non-sensitive records. This leads to an
improvement in accuracy. Clearly, as the input mechanism, M,
to the compiler becomes better (i.e., has lower error) so does the
compiled sensitively private mechanism, Uδ , since the error of Uδ ,
is never more than that of M.
Theorem 4.7. For k ≥ 1 and a given valid ε/2-DP mechanism,
M, for any AIQ, (i, д), and non-negative 2-Lipschitz continuous lower
bound, δ, on ∆GS − ∆G, Construction 2 yields an ε-SP mechanism,
Uδ , for k-sensitive neighborhood graph corresponding to the anomaly
definition for д such that
P (Uδ (x ) (cid:44) д(i, x )) = P (M (x ) (cid:44) д(i, x )) e
− ε4 δ (i,x ) .
To confirm the above claim, we show that the mechanism, Uδ ,
given by the construction above indeed satisfies the privacy con-
straints imposed by the sensitive privacy definition for every two
neighboring databases in k-sensitive neighborhood graph. We can
accomplish this by showing that the privacy constraints are satisfied
by any two arbitrarily picked neighbors, x and y, for an arbitrarily
picked valid ε/2-differentially private mechanism, M, for an anom-
aly identification query, (i, д) and a δ as specified above. We can
divide the argument into two cases, and confirm in each case that
the privacy constraints are satisfied. Case 1: δ (i, x ) = δ (i, y) = 0,
which follows due to M being differentially private; because if M
is ε/2-differentially private then it is also ε-differentially private.
Case 2: δ (i, x ) > δ (i, y) ≥ 0 — this is without loss of generality since
x and y are picked arbitrarily. This case holds because of the fol-
lowing: M is valid ε/2-differentially private, δ is non-negative and
2-Lipschitz continuous, д(i, x ) = д(i, y) (because for neighboring
x and y, ∆GS (i, x ) − ∆G (i, x ) ≥ δ (i, x ) > 0 implies ∆GS (i, x ) ≥ 2).
We give the complete proof of Theorem 4.7 in Appendix A.8.
We highlight the effectiveness of the compiler by instantiating it
for δ (i, x ) = λ1 (i, x ) − ∆G (i, x ) for every i and x for (β, r )-anomaly.
Figure 5 shows the compilation of two DP mechanisms for (β, r )-
AIQ, which widely differ in their performance. As expected, the
compiled SP-mechanism outperforms the input DP-mechanism.
In Figure 5a, the input DP mechanism, M, has a constant error for
every input database, that is, 1/(1 + eε ) for fixed ε = 0.25. Clearly,

The aim of this work is to study the effect of privacy in identify-
ing anomalies. So we keep the focus on evaluating the proposed
approach for achieving privacy for this problem, and how it com-
pares to differential privacy in real world settings. Our experiments
make use of (popular) (β, r ) notion of anomaly.
Following the standard practice for identifying outliers in the
data with higher dimension [1, 28], we carried out the principal
component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of the three
datasets with higher dimension. We chose, top 6, 9, and 12 features
for the Credit Fraud, Synthetic, and APS Trucks datasets respec-
tively. Next, we obtain the values of β and r, which typically

is 0.25-DP for a fixed record i and δ (given in the figure).
Each database x is given by (xi , Bx (i, r )) since (β, r )-anomaly
identification function only depends upon xi and Bx (i, r )).
Each mechanism is depicted by its error over databases i.e.

this mechanism has extremely bad accuracy. This is a difficult case
even for the compiled mechanism, which nevertheless, attains expo-
nential gain in accuracy for non-sensitive records. However, when
we input the DP-mechanism given in Section 4.1.1, which is much
better than the one in Figure 5a, the compiled mechanism is clearly
superior compared to the one in Figure 5a (Figure 5b).
Note that the δ in Figure 5 is a non-negative 2-Lipschitz continuous
lower bound on ∆GS − ∆G (as required by Theorem 4.7), where λ1
is given by (3) for k = 1 and ∆G is given by (2). δ = λ1 − ∆G ≥ 0
follows because ∆GS ≥ λ1 ≥ ∆G. The first inequality follows
from Lemma 4.5. The second one trivially holds true for all the
cases except for xi ≥ 1 and Bx (i, r ) < β, where λ1 (i, x ) = β +
1 − Bx (i, r ) and ∆G (i, x ) = min(xi , β + 1 − Bx (i, r )); thus, even in
this case, we get δ (i, x ) = max(β + 1 − Bx (i, r ) − xi , 0) ≥ 0. The
2-Lipschitz continuity of δ follows from the λ1 and ∆G being 1-
Lipschitz continuous (Lemma 4.5 and Lemma 4.3). Thus, for any i
and two neighbors x and y in GS (1-sensitive neighborhood graph),
|δ (i, x ) − δ (i, y)| ≤|λ1 (i, x ) − λ1(i, y)| + |∆G (i, x ) − ∆G (i, y)| ≤ 2.
Remark: We emphasize that both of our constructions are not
tied to any specific definition of anomaly, and even the requirement
of Lipschitz continuity is due to privacy constraints.
5 EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
To evaluate the performance of the SP-mechanism for (β, r )-anomaly
identification, we carry out several experiments on synthetic dataset
and real-world datasets from diverse domains: Credit Fraud [10]
(available at Kaggle [23]), Mammography and Thyroid (available at
Outlier Detection DataSets Library [41]), and APS Trucks (APS Fail-
ure at Scania Trucks, available at UCI machine learning repository
[14]). Table 1 provides the datasets specifications.
To generate the synthetic data, we followed the strategy of Dong
et al. [12], which is standard in the literature. The synthetic data

are provided by the domain experts [35]. Here, we employed the
protocol outlined in Appendix A.2 to find β and r; this protocol
follows the basic idea of parameter selection presented in the work
[35] that proposed the notion of (β, r )-anomaly. Table 1 gives the
values of β and r, which we found through the protocol, along with
the number of true (β, r )-anomalies (true anomalies identifiable by
(β, r )-anomaly method for the given parameter values).
Error: We measure the error of a private mechanism (which is
a randomized algorithm) as its probability of outputting the wrong
answer—recall that in the case of AIQ, there are only two possible
answers, i.e. 0 or 1. For each AIQ for a fixed record, we estimate the
error by the average number of mistakes over m trials. So for our
experiments we choose m to be 10000.
For each dataset, we find all the true (β, r )-anomalies and for
each of them perform private anomaly identification query using
SP-mechanism (given in Section 4.1.2) and DP-mechanism (given
in Section 4.1.1) for ε = 0.01, 0.1, and 1 and compute the error,
which we give by the box plot in Figure 6. The reason we only
considered our DP mechanism for this part is that it is the best
among the baselines (see Table 3) and it also has strong accuracy
guarantees (Theorem 4.4). The error of SP-mechanism, in many
cases, is so small (e.g. of the order 10−15 or even smaller for larger
values of ε) that it can be considered zero for all practical purposes.
Furthermore, as the data size increases (and correspondingly the
value of β), the error of SP-mechanism reduces. However, in the
case of anomalies, the error of DP-mechanism is consistently close

to that of random coin flip (i.e. selecting 0 or 1 with probability 1/2)
except for a few anomalous records in some cases – we will shortly
explain the reason for this. The error of the SP-mechanism was
overwhelmingly concentrated about zero (Figure 6), which is also
true for the smaller values of ε. Thus, we can have higher privacy
guarantee for sensitive records, while still being able to accurately
identify anomalies. Also, note that as the size of the dataset increases,
not only does the error of SP-mechanism reduces (for anomalies),
