Figure 1: Moving average over the current plus 5 previous
months of the percentage of vulnerabilities at each severity level
(low is blue solid line, medium is red long-dashed line, high is
green short-dashed line, and critical is yellow dash-dotted line).
In this and subsequent line graphs, the data are aggregated by
month to improve graph readability, and the x-axis represents
the open date of the bug.
4.1.2 Vulnerability severity
Another measure of improvement to product security is
change in vulnerability severity over time. It is a good
sign, for example, if the percentage of critical-severity
vulnerabilities has decreased over time.
Table 1 lists the total number of vulnerabilities by sever-
ity for Firefox and Chrome. Figure 1 plots the fraction of
vulnerabilities at each severity level over the current plus
5 previous months.
Discussion Firefox has a much higher ratio of criti-
cal vulnerabilities to high vulnerabilities than Chrome.
We expect that many of Firefox’s critical vulnerabilities
would instead be high severity if, like Chrome, it also had
a privilege-separated architecture. The lack of such an
architecture means that any memory corruption vulnera-

bility in Firefox is a critical vulnerability. We therefore
hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 1 This architectural difference between
Chrome and Firefox—that
the former is privilege-
separated and the latter is not—is the most inﬂuential
factor in causing such a large difference in vulnerability
severity classiﬁcation.
The fraction of critical severity bugs has remained rela-
tively constant for Chrome. We also notice the start of a
trend in Chrome—the fraction of high severity vulnera-
bilities is declining and the fraction of medium severity
vulnerabilities is increasing.
Chrome’s privilege-separated architecture means that a
critical vulnerability indicates malicious code execution
in the privileged process. We see that there continue to
be new bugs resulting in code execution in the privileged
process. Further investigation into these bugs can help
understand how and why they continue to surface.
Low-severity vulnerabilities in Google Chrome make
up a signiﬁcant fraction of all vulnerabilities reported.
In contrast, the fraction of low- and medium-severity
vulnerabilities in Firefox remains negligible.
Note that our dataset does not allow us to attribute
any change in vulnerability severity over time to the use
or success of a VRP. However, severity over time is a
metric worth tracking for a software vendor because it can
indicate trends in the overall efforts to improve product
security, of which a VRP may be one component.
4.1.3 Community engagement
One advantage of VRPs is engagement with the broader
security community. We studied this engagement along
two axes: (1) the contribution of internal and external
researchers towards identifying security vulnerabilities,
and (2) the number of external participants in each VRP.
Figure 2 depicts the cumulative number of high- and
critical-severity vulnerabilities patched and Figure 3 de-
picts the same, but for only critical vulnerabilities. Table 2
shows the distribution of the total number of vulnerabil-
ities reported by each external participant in each of the
two VRPs. Although a few external participants submit
many bugs, there is a clear long tail of participants in
both VRPs. Table 3 shows the same distribution, but for
internal (i.e., employee) reporters of vulnerabilities.
Discussion For both browsers, internal contributions
for high- and critical-severity vulnerabilities have consis-
tently yielded the majority of patches. The number of
external contributions to Chrome has nearly caught up
with the number of internal contributions (i.e., around
4/11 and 3/12, in Figure 2a) at various times, and as of
the end of our study, these two quantities are comparable.
Considering only critical-severity vulnerabilities, external
contributions have exceeded internal contributions as of

the end of our study. For Firefox, on the other hand, the
number of external contributions has consistently been
far lower than the number of internal contributions.
We observe an increase in the rate of external contri-
butions to Chrome starting around July 2010, six months
after the inception of the VRP. As seen in Figure 3a,
this is more pronounced when considering only critical-
severity vulnerabilities. We conjecture that this change
corresponds to increased publicity for the Chrome VRP
after Google increased reward amounts [19].
Linus’s Law, deﬁned by Eric Raymond as “Given
enough eyes, all bugs are shallow,” suggests that it is
in the interests of the software vendor to encourage more
people to participate in the search for bugs. The distribu-
tions of bugs found by external participants indicate that
both VRPs have been successful in encouraging broad
community participation. The existence of a long tail
of contributors holds for internal contributors as well as
external contributors.

4.1.4 Diversity
There is the potential beneﬁt that the wide variety of
external participants may ﬁnd different types of vulner-
abilities than internal members of the security team. A
few pieces of anecdotal evidence support this. Chrome
has awarded bounty amounts that include $1,337, $2,337,
