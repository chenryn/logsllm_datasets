### 4.1.2 Vulnerability Severity

Another key indicator of product security improvement is the change in vulnerability severity over time. A decrease in the percentage of critical-severity vulnerabilities, for example, is a positive sign.

**Table 1: Total Number of Vulnerabilities by Severity for Firefox and Chrome**

| Browser | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|---------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| Firefox |     |        |      |          |
| Chrome  |     |        |      |          |

- **Medium**: Red long-dashed line
- **High**: Green short-dashed line
- **Critical**: Yellow dash-dotted line

In this and subsequent line graphs, the data are aggregated by month to improve readability, with the x-axis representing the open date of the bug.

#### Discussion

Firefox has a significantly higher ratio of critical to high-severity vulnerabilities compared to Chrome. This difference can be attributed to the architectural differences between the two browsers. Chrome's privilege-separated architecture means that many vulnerabilities that would be classified as critical in Firefox are instead classified as high in Chrome. Specifically, any memory corruption vulnerability in Firefox is considered critical due to the lack of such an architecture.

**Hypothesis 1:** The architectural difference between Chrome (privilege-separated) and Firefox (not privilege-separated) is the most influential factor in causing the large difference in vulnerability severity classification.

For Chrome, the fraction of critical severity bugs has remained relatively constant. However, there is a trend where the fraction of high-severity vulnerabilities is declining, while the fraction of medium-severity vulnerabilities is increasing. This suggests that Chrome's architecture is effective in mitigating the impact of some vulnerabilities.

Low-severity vulnerabilities in Google Chrome make up a significant fraction of all reported vulnerabilities. In contrast, the fraction of low- and medium-severity vulnerabilities in Firefox remains negligible.

It is important to note that our dataset does not allow us to attribute changes in vulnerability severity over time to the use or success of a Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP). However, tracking severity over time is a valuable metric for software vendors, as it can indicate trends in overall efforts to improve product security, of which a VRP may be one component.

### 4.1.3 Community Engagement

One of the advantages of VRPs is the engagement with the broader security community. We studied this engagement along two axes:

1. **Contribution of Internal and External Researchers**: Identifying security vulnerabilities.
2. **Number of External Participants**: In each VRP.

#### Discussion

For both browsers, internal contributions have consistently yielded the majority of patches for high- and critical-severity vulnerabilities. For Chrome, the number of external contributions has nearly caught up with internal contributions, particularly around July 2010, six months after the inception of the VRP. By the end of our study, the number of external contributions for critical-severity vulnerabilities had exceeded internal contributions.

For Firefox, the number of external contributions has consistently been far lower than the number of internal contributions.

We observed an increase in the rate of external contributions to Chrome starting around July 2010, which we conjecture is due to increased publicity for the Chrome VRP after Google increased reward amounts [19].

Linusâ€™s Law, defined by Eric Raymond as "Given enough eyes, all bugs are shallow," suggests that it is in the interests of the software vendor to encourage more people to participate in the search for bugs. The distributions of bugs found by external participants indicate that both VRPs have been successful in encouraging broad community participation. The existence of a long tail of contributors holds for both internal and external contributors.

### 4.1.4 Diversity

There is a potential benefit in the wide variety of external participants, as they may find different types of vulnerabilities than internal members of the security team. Anecdotal evidence supports this. Chrome has awarded bounty amounts that include $1,337, $2,337, and other unique figures, which may attract a diverse range of contributors.
