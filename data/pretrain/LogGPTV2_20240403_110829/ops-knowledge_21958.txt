User: How to configure network interface and routing table in Linux system? Please provide corresponding configuration commands and explanations.
Assistant: 1. Configure the network interface First, open the terminal and enter the command ifconfig to display the network interface and related information in the current system, for example: ``` $ ifconfig enp0s3 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:0c:29:4b:6f:45 inet addr :192.168.20.128 Bcast:192.168.20.255 Mask:255.255.255.0 inet6 addr: fe80::20c:29ff:fe4b:6f45/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:2 15 errors: 0 dropped :0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:162 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:25982 (25.3 KiB) TX bytes:18623 (18.1 KiB) lo Link encap: Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0 inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:65536 Metric:1 RX packets:200 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:200 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1 RX bytes:18000 (17.5 KiB) TX bytes:18000 (17.5 KiB) ``` where enp0s3 is the name of an Ethernet card, lo is the name of the loopback interface. Next, use the command ifconfig network interface name ip address subnet mask to configure the corresponding network interface. For example: ``` $ sudo ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.20.128 netmask 255.255.255.0 up ``` Among them, sudo is used to elevate the privileges of the current user, enp0s3 is the name of the network interface, 192.168.20.128 is the IP address of the interface, and 255.255. 255.0 is the subnet mask of the interface, up means enable the interface. 2. Configure the routing table The routing table of the Linux system stores the network routing information of the system. Use the command route to view the routing table information of the current system: ``` $ route -n Kernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface 0.0.0.0 192.168.20.2 0.0.0.0 UG 100 0 0 enp0s3 192.168.20.0 0.0. 0.0 255.255.255.0 U 100 0 0 enp0s3 ``` Among them, the first column is the destination address, the second column is the routing gateway, the third column is the subnet mask, the fourth column is the routing flag, and the fifth column is the metric , the sixth column is the number of references, and the seventh column is the interface name of the network card. Use the command route to add a route: ``` $ sudo route add -net 192.168.10.0/24 gw 192.168.20.1 dev enp0s3 ``` Among them, sudo is used to elevate the authority of the current user, add means to add a new route, and -net means the target Network address, 192.168.10.0/24 is the destination network address and subnet mask, gw represents the gateway address, 192.168.20.1 is the gateway address, dev represents the interface name, and enp0s3 is the interface name. Use the command route to delete the route: ``` $ sudo route del -net 192.168.10.0/24 gw 192.168.20.1 dev enp0s3 ``` Among them, del means to delete the route, -net means the target network address, 192.168.10.0/24 is the target Network address and subnet mask, gw means gateway address, 192.168.20.1 is gateway address, dev means interface name, enp0s3 is interface name.
