User: I'm currently in college, and we work in groups of three to create small python projects on a weekly basis.
We code with Eclipse and PyDev but we've got a problem when it comes to sharing our work. We end up sending an infinite stream of emails with compressed projects.
What we need is a way to keep the source code updated and we need to be able to share it between us. (on both Windows and Linux) What do you recommend? 
thanks in advance.
Assistant: What you need is a control version server (SVN for instance). You will be able to commit the changes and update the local version of your code  to the current server version.
It is for free:

You should set up your repo and share your work! :-)
I hope it helps.
