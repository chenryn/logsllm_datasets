I am currently a college student, and as part of my coursework, I work in a group of three to develop small Python projects on a weekly basis. We use Eclipse with the PyDev plugin for coding. However, we are facing challenges when it comes to sharing our work. Currently, we end up sending an endless stream of emails with compressed project files, which is inefficient and cumbersome.

We need a solution that allows us to keep our source code updated and easily shareable among the team members, who use both Windows and Linux. Could you recommend a suitable tool or method for this?

Thank you in advance for your help.

**Response:**

For your needs, I recommend using a version control system, such as Git. Git is widely used in the software development industry and provides a robust way to manage and share code. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with your team, and maintain a history of your project.

Here are some steps to get started:

1. **Set Up a Git Repository:**
   - You can host your repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These platforms offer free accounts for open-source and small private projects.
   - Create a new repository on one of these platforms and follow the instructions to set it up.

2. **Install Git:**
   - Install Git on your local machine. It is available for both Windows and Linux.
   - For Windows, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - For Linux, you can usually install it via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` on Ubuntu).

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use the `git clone` command to create a local copy of the repository on each team member's machine.
   - For example: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git`

4. **Make Changes and Commit:**
   - As you make changes to your code, stage them using `git add .` and commit them using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
   - Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push origin main` (or `master` if that is the default branch).

5. **Pull Changes:**
   - To get the latest changes from the remote repository, use `git pull origin main`.

Using Git will streamline your workflow, reduce the need for email exchanges, and ensure that everyone has the most up-to-date version of the project.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
