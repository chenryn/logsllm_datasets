User: How to graphically monitor the performance of the Linux system and make adjustments based on the results?
Assistant: You can use some performance monitoring tools to monitor performance graphically, as follows: 1. Top: Top is a common command-line tool used to monitor the real-time performance of the system. It can display CPU, memory, swap, process, thread and network usage. 2. Htop: Htop is an alternative to Top, which provides more detailed information and supports mouse and interactive operations. 3. Nmon: Nmon is a performance monitoring tool specially used for Linux systems. It can monitor the usage of resources such as CPU, memory, network and disk, and can generate performance reports. 4. Sysstat: Sysstat is a system performance monitoring tool that can monitor the usage of resources such as CPU, memory, disk and network of the system, and can generate historical performance charts. 5. Netdata: Netdata is an open source real-time performance monitoring tool that can monitor the usage of resources such as CPU, memory, disk, network and application programs, and provide interactive performance charts. The method of making adjustments based on graphical monitoring results is as follows: 1. Identify performance bottlenecks: use monitoring tools to identify system performance bottlenecks, such as high usage of resources such as CPU, memory, or disk. 2. Improve resource utilization: According to the results of performance monitoring, you can take some optimization measures to improve the utilization of system resources, such as increasing memory, using high-performance CPU, or upgrading disks. 3. Optimize the application: If the performance problem is caused by the application, you can improve the performance by optimizing the program code or changing the way the program works. 4. Adjust system settings: According to the results of performance monitoring, you can adjust system settings to improve system performance, such as adjusting system kernel parameters or changing file system configurations.
