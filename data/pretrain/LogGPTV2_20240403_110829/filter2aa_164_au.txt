### Physical Connection of the CSI Connector

The CSI (Camera Serial Interface) connector, as depicted in Figure 16.1, is a 15-pin flex ribbon cable. One end of this cable connects to the CSI-2 interface on the Raspberry Pi PCB, while the other end is soldered directly to the Raspberry Pi Camera Board, as shown in Figure 16.2.

**Figure 16.2: Raspberry Pi Camera Board PCB**

### Specifications of the Raspberry Pi Camera Board

The specifications for the Raspberry Pi Camera Board, also known as the Camera Module, are listed in Table 16.1.

**Table 16.1: Raspberry Pi Camera Board Specifications**

You will find that the Raspberry Pi Camera Board's specifications compare favorably with those of the iPhone 4 from summer 2010. In fact, the Camera Board often produces better video quality than many entry-level webcams.

### Handling and Setup

The Camera Board comes in an anti-static bag enclosed in a minimalist paper box. When handling the Camera Board, be cautious not to kink the ribbon cable, as it is quite delicate. Additionally, avoid touching the camera lens to prevent fingerprint smudges.

Let's proceed with setting up your new Raspberry Pi Camera Board and start capturing images and videos.

### Installing and Configuring the Raspberry Pi Camera Board

Setting up the Raspberry Pi Camera Board involves two main steps:

1. **Preparing the Pi and installing the camera driver**
2. **Physically installing the camera**

In this chapter, we assume you are using the official Raspbian Linux distribution.

#### Task: Preparing the Raspberry Pi for the Camera Board

It is important to never connect hardware to a computer's motherboard while the computer is powered on. Before physically attaching the Camera Board, you need to enable the camera functionality in Raspbian.

1. **Do not plug in the Camera Board yet.** Power on the Pi, open a Terminal prompt, and update your software:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

2. **Launch the `raspi-config` utility:**
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```

3. **In `raspi-config`, navigate to the Camera option and press Enter.**

4. **In the "Enable support for Raspberry Pi camera?" dialog box (Figure 16.3), select "Enable" and press Enter.**

   **Figure 16.3: Enabling the Camera Board using `raspi-config`.**

5. **Exit `raspi-config` and reboot your Pi. After the reboot, shut down the system to prepare for the Camera Board installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -h now
   ```

Now that the necessary device drivers are installed and the Raspberry Pi is ready, let's proceed with the physical installation.

#### Task: Installing the Raspberry Pi Camera Board

With the Pi's software configured and the power removed, you can now proceed with the physical installation. Be cautious, as the CSI-2 interface on the Raspberry Pi is delicate.

1. **Ensure the Raspberry Pi is powered off and unplug all cables.**

2. **Gently lift the retaining clip on the CSI-2 connector by grasping its edges. The clip should lift approximately 1-2mm.**

3. **Insert the Camera Board ribbon cable into the CSI-2 interface with the copper traces facing away from the USB ports. Refer to Figure 16.4 for the correct orientation.**

   **Figure 16.4: Correct orientation for inserting the Camera Board ribbon cable.**

4. **Once the ribbon cable is seated, gently press down on the retaining clip to secure the connection.**

**Figure 16.5: The Raspberry Pi and the Camera Board are now a functional unit.**

### Using the Camera Board

The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides two command-line utilities for the Camera Board:

- **`raspistill`:** Used to take still images in both JPEG and RAW formats.
- **`raspivid`:** Used to record video using the H.264 codec.

#### Capturing Still Pictures

To get started, obtain some command-line syntax help:
```bash
raspistill | less
```
**Figure 16.6: `raspistill` command syntax.**

To capture a still image, use the following command:
```bash
raspistill -o myimage.jpg
```
When you run `raspistill`, an LED on the Camera Board will light up for about four seconds, and the image will be exposed just before the LED goes out.

Images are stored in the current working directory. For example, if you run the command in your home directory, the images will be saved there.

- **The `-o` switch allows you to name the image file.**
- **From LXDE, you can double-click the image files to open them in your default web browser or use ImageMagick (display) to view them.**

**Figure 16.7: Example of a captured image.**

Here are some additional examples of `raspistill` commands:

- **Take an image with a quality of 50% and a shutter delay of 10 seconds:**
  ```bash
  raspistill -o image3.jpg -q 50 -t 10000
  ```

- **Take an image with custom dimensions, verbose output, a quality of 80%, and a one-second delay:**
  ```bash
  raspistill -v -w 1024 -h 768 -q 80 -o image4.jpg -t 1000
  ```

**Figure 16.8: Verbose output of the `raspistill` command.**

#### Recording Video with the Camera Board

The `raspivid` command-line utility is used to capture full-motion video. To see the `raspivid` command syntax, use:
```bash
raspivid | less
```
**Figure 16.9: `raspivid` command syntax.**

To record a five-second video, use:
```bash
raspivid -o fiveseconds.h264
```

To record a 15-second video at a smaller resolution:
```bash
raspivid -o smallvid.h264 -t 15000 -w 1024 -h 768
```

**Note: Storage Considerations**
- **Recording at 1080p uses approximately 17 MB per second or 115 MB per minute.**
- **Consider using a higher-capacity SD card for extensive video recording.**

#### Encoding a `raspivid` Video File

The `raspivid` captures a raw H.264 data stream, which is not immediately viewable. You can wrap this stream into an MP4 container using the following steps:

1. **Install `MP4Box`:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y gpac
   ```

2. **Convert the H.264 stream to an MP4 file:**
   ```bash
   MP4Box -fps 30 -add smallvid.h264 smallvid.mp4
   ```

3. **Play the video using `omxplayer` or `VLC`:**
   ```bash
   omxplayer smallvid.mp4
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y vlc
   vlc smallvid.mp4
   ```

### Using a Third-Party USB Webcam

If you have a compatible USB webcam, you can use it instead of the Raspberry Pi Camera Board. Check the list of verified peripherals at [Raspberry Pi Peripherals](http://is.gd/ZJA79A).

#### Task: Configuring a Third-Party USB Webcam

1. **Plug in your webcam, preferably into a powered USB hub.**

2. **Verify that the Raspberry Pi recognizes your device:**
   ```bash
   lsusb
   ```

   **Figure 16.10: Output of the `lsusb` command.**

3. **Edit the Motion configuration files:**
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/default/motion
   ```
   Change `start_motion_daemon=no` to `start_motion_daemon=yes`.

4. **Edit the `motion.conf` file:**
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf
   ```

**Note: Web Accessibility**
- **For making your Raspberry Pi webcam accessible over the internet, refer to Chapter 15, "Raspberry Pi Web Server," for instructions on using No-IP.**

**Figure 16.11: Logitech HD Webcam C615.**

By following these steps, you can set up and use your Raspberry Pi Camera Board or a third-party USB webcam effectively.
