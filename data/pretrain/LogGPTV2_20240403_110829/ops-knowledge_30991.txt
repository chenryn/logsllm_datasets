Configure the client to connect to the VPN server The client needs to install the OpenVPN client. On Windows, the installer can be downloaded from OpenVPN's official website. On iOS, the OpenVPN Connect app can be downloaded from the App Store. Then, you need to generate a certificate and key on the client, and create a configuration file identical to that of the server, and add the following content to the configuration file: client dev tun proto udp remote [server IP address] 1194 resolv-retry infinite nobind persist- key persist-tun ca ca.crt cert client.crt key client.key ns-cert-type server cipher AES-256-CBC comp-lzo verb 3 4. Start the OpenVPN server To start the OpenVPN server, use the following command: sudo systemctl start openvpn 5. Test Connection To test the connection, use the following command: ping 10.8.0.1 If the connection is successful, you should be able to ping the server's VPN address (10.8.0.1). The above are the steps to configure the Linux server as a VPN server. Windows and iOS devices can be used to connect to the VPN server. For specific connection methods, please refer to the official OpenVPN documentation.
