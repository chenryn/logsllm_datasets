##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
user
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.4.1.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = [u'/home/v683653/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
      ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
      executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
      python version = 2.7.5 (default, May  3 2017, 07:55:04) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-14)]
##### CONFIGURATION
PERSISTENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT(/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg) = 30  
RETRY_FILES_SAVE_PATH(/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg) = /tmp/ansibleretry
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
used on rhel6 and rhel7 servers
##### SUMMARY
When I run the user module to remove a user, if that user doesn't exist on the
system then the module reports a failure as seen below.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
use the user module to remove a user from a system that the user doesn't exist
on.
      - name: Remove user account
        user:
          state: absent
          remove: yes
          name: bob
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
If the user doesn't exist then I figured that the idempotent part would see
that the user doesn't exist and would therefore report an OK but not fail.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
The task fails with the error below.
