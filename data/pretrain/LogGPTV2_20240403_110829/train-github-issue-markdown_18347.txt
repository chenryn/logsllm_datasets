I'm trying to calculate the NDCG score for binary relevance:
    from sklearn import metrics
    # test 1
    y_true = [[3]]
    y_score = [[5]]
    metrics.ndcg_score(y_true, y_score)
And getting error
`ValueError: Only ('multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput',
'multiclass-multioutput') formats are supported. Got binary instead `
Below code snippet is working which has more than 1 item. Please suggest why
single item array is not working.
    from sklearn import metrics
    # test 1
    y_true = [[6 ,5, 4, 3, 2, 1]]
    y_score = [[120, -2, -6, -3,  2, 12]]
    metrics.ndcg_score(y_true, y_score)
