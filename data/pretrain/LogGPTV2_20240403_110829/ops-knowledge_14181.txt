User: I'm making a Python package that gets installed with a setup.py file using setuptools.
The package includes a GUI, and when it's installed on a Windows machine, I want the installation to make a folder in "Programs" in the start menu, and make a shortcut there to a pyw script that will start the GUI. (The pyw think works on all platforms, right?)
On Mac and Linux, I would like it to put this shortcut in whatever Mac and Linux have that is parallel to the start menu.
How do I do this?
Assistant: Since setuptools doesn't seem to give an easy solution to this, I've decided to give up on this idea until I release my app with py2exe/InnoSetup.
