    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    $ cat k.c
    #include 
    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
            printf("hello\n");
            return 0;
    }
    $ cat k.go
    package main
    func main() {
            println("hello")
    }
    $ rm -f *.o *.gc* k
    $ /opt/gccgo/bin/gcc -o k k.c --coverage
    k.gcno is created
    $ ./k
    hello
    k.gcda is created
    $ gcov k
    File 'k.c'
    Lines executed:100.00% of 3
    Creating 'k.c.gcov'
    looks good
    now with go:
    $ rm -f *.o *.gc* k
    $ /opt/gccgo/bin/gccgo -o k k.go --coverage
    k.gcno is created
    $ ./k
    hello
    k.gcna is not created
