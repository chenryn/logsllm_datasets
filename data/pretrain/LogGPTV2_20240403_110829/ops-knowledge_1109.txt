User: How to manage processes in Linux system? Please provide a basic process management guide.
Assistant: In the Linux system, you can use some tools to manage processes, including: 1. top: The top command can display information such as processes running in the system, CPU usage, and memory usage in real time. Enter the top command in the terminal to run it, and press the q key to exit. 2. ps: The ps command can list the process information in the current system. When using the ps command, you can add the parameter -a or -e to list all process information. For example: ps -ef can list all running processes. 3. kill: The kill command can end a process. When using the kill command, you need to know the process ID (PID) of the process. For example: kill -9 1234 can end the process whose process ID is 1234. 4. htop: htop is a more advanced process management tool than top. It can display the resource usage of all processes in the system and provide an interactive interface. Enter the htop command to open the htop interface, and press the F1 key to view the help information. 5. pstree: The pstree command can display the process information in the current system in the form of a tree diagram. When using the pstree command, you can add the parameter -a to list all process information. For example: pstree -a can list all running processes and display them in a tree diagram. 6. renice: The renice command can modify the priority of a process. When using the renice command, you need to know the process ID (PID) of the process. For example: renice -5 1234 can reduce the process priority of process number 1234 by 5 values. 7. nice: The nice command can change the priority of the process while running the process. When using the nice command, you need to know the command to run and the priority value. For example: nice -n 5 command can make the command command run as a process with a priority of 5. The above are the commonly used process management tools and commands in Linux. You can choose the appropriate tools and commands according to your specific needs.
