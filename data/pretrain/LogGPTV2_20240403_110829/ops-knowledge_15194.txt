User: How to prevent DDoS attacks? Please introduce some common defense strategies.
Assistant: The following are several common DDoS attack defense strategies: 1. Enhance the capacity of network infrastructure: measures such as increasing network bandwidth and using load balancing technology can reduce the pressure on network hosts and improve the bearing capacity of network infrastructure. 2. Firewall: Use the firewall to filter out malicious traffic by detecting and filtering specific TCP and UDP packets. 3. CDN: Use CDN to cache website static assets (such as CSS, JS, pictures, etc.) on distributed global nodes to disperse traffic and mitigate attacks. 4. Use traffic cleaning: Use the traffic cleaning service to filter out DDoS attack traffic and prevent attacks from affecting real users. 5. Limiting user submission requests: Limiting the speed of the web server and limiting the maximum number of requests per client can prevent attackers from saturating the server with a large number of requests. 6. Reasonable network topology: rationalize the network topology, use isolation technology to reduce the attack surface, and reduce the risk of attack. 7. Upgrade hardware: Upgrade hardware devices and servers to make them more efficient and faster, which can increase their processing power and endurance, and reduce the risk of DDoS attacks.
