Abstract
In 2016, a large North American university was sub-
ject to a signiﬁcant crypto-ransomware attack and did
not pay the ransom. We conducted a survey with 150
respondents and interviews with 30 affected students,
staff, and faculty in the immediate aftermath to under-
stand their experiences during the attack and the recov-
ery process. We provide analysis of the technologi-
cal, productivity, and personal and social impact of ran-
somware attacks, including previously unaccounted sec-
ondary costs. We suggest strategies for comprehensive
cyber-response plans that include human factors, and
highlight the importance of communication. We con-
clude with a Ransomware Process for Organizations dia-
gram summarizing the additional contributing factors be-
yond those relevant to individual infections.

Introduction
In the Fall of 2016, a large North American university
was subject to a crypto-ransomware attack. The attack
occurred just before the start of the exam period and
coincided with major national scholarship application
deadlines. The malware compromised Windows com-
puters accessible from the university’s main network dur-
ing off-hours, infecting computers that were powered on
and propagated through the network overnight. Exact de-
tails of the attack were never made public (and cannot be
disclosed here), but the attack impacted many comput-
ers belonging to research groups, academic departments,
and all levels of university services.
Initially described by the university as a “network in-
terruption”, most of the university’s computer systems
were temporarily shutdown or taken ofﬂine to contain
damage. The university did not pay the demanded ran-
som of 39 bitcoins (approximately $38,000 at the time)
to release the encrypted ﬁles. Immediate recovery efforts
took several days, with the productivity impact being felt
by users for weeks post-attack.
Most current ransomware falls under one of two gen-
eral categories: lockers/blockers, which focuses on dis-
abling resources such as denying access to the device,
and crypto, which encrypts data ﬁles on the infected
device and withholds access to the decryption key.
In
both cases, the attackers request ransom to regain ac-
cess [19, 38]. In this paper, we primarily concentrate on
crypto-ransomware, as was used in this incident.
There is a signiﬁcant rise in ransomware infections
within organizations [18, 29]. Given the prevalence of
this threat, it is critical that we understand its impact on
organizations. The technical tasks in the aftermath of
such an attack such as containing the threat and returning
the systems to a functional state are clearly of vital im-
portance, but an attack of this scale also has signiﬁcant
impact on the individuals within the organization. Our
aim was to understand the immediate and longer-term
impact of this incident on end-users in hopes of learning
how organizations can better prepare and respond. As re-
searchers, we were not involved in the recovery efforts;
our intention was to learn from the incident as third-party
observers, not to assign blame or criticize. Rarely do we
have the opportunity to conduct research studies with a
large number of victims of cybercrime in the immedi-
ate aftermath of the incident; we believe that the time-
sensitive data collected here offers valuable insight.
We conducted a survey with 150 respondents and in-
terviews with 30 affected students, staff, and faculty to
understand their experiences during the attack and the re-
covery process. Our main contributions are: (1) analysis
of the technological, productivity, and personal and so-
cial impact of ransomware attacks, including previously
unaccounted secondary costs, (2) strategies for the devel-
opment of a comprehensive cyber-response that include
human factors and highlights the importance of com-
munication, and (3) a reﬁned Ransomware Process for
Organizations diagram summarizing the additional con-
tributing factors beyond individual infections.

2 Background and Related Work
Although the ﬁrst instances of ransomware can be traced
back approximately 30 years, the surge in modern ran-
somware began in 2005 [19, 33], with a dramatic in-
crease in prevalence [27] and research attention since
2015. A 2018 literature survey and taxonomy by Al-
Rimy, Maarof, and Shaid [2] offers a recent overview of
the research landscape, while Scaife, Traynor, and But-
ler [35] present a great introduction to the subject.
Organizational Considerations:
Technical Efforts: Most of the research has focused
on the technical aspects of ransomware. Several proac-
tive or preventative techniques have recently been been
proposed, such as UNVEIL [20], ShieldFS [8], Crypto-
Drop [34], and PayBreak [22] which operate at the oper-
ating system and ﬁlesystem levels to detect and correct
suspicious activity, or FlashGuard [16], which uses the
ﬁrmware-level recovery properties of solid state drives
(SSD) to recover without explicit backups. Among oth-
ers, some have worked on improving detection by de-
vising new techniques for identifying obfuscated bina-
ries [26] and for automated behavioral analysis to extract
footprints [7] to identify ransomware and other malware.
If the malware is
correctly implemented, recovery once systems have been
infected is largely a matter of re-imaging and restoring
from backups [35] since decryption is infeasible. Even
if successful, this process is usually slow and painstak-
ing [40, 41], and is only as reliable as the latest back-
ups.
It can leave organizations with signiﬁcant down-
time, productivity loss, and revenue losses [24, 29]. Ac-
cording to Sophos,
the median cost to organizations
for recovering from a ransomware attack in 2017 was
US$133,000 [38]. Kaspersky Labs [18] report that 47%
of medium-sized business spend several days to restore
access to encrypted data and 25% spend several weeks.
In the absence of backups or if the backup ﬁles are also
encrypted, the victim may have little choice but to pay
the ransom in hope to that decryption key will restore the
affected ﬁles. The decision of whether to pay the ransom
is contentious [9,24]. Statistics relating to how much and
how often victims pay the ransom are unreliable given
that there is no onus to report such actions. Estimates
range from 25% to 65% [10, 15, 29]. Organizations are
increasingly targeted, particularly by malware designed
to quickly spread across networks, and are proportionally
being demanded to pay larger ransoms [29]. The most
common expert advice to organizations is to not pay the
ransom [9, 10, 17, 24, 31], but others suggest that paying
the attacker may be worth the risk since, without the de-
cryption key, organization could further suffer from lost
productivity and expenses spent on recovery [41].
Human Involvement: Other work highlights that ran-
somware prevention, mitigation, and recovery require a
socio-technical approach including active involvement of
users through appropriate security practices [37]. Luo
and Liao [23] recommend that prevention of ransomware
threats in organizations should focus on awareness edu-
cation for both upper management and employees.
In a personal account of dealing with ransomware [3],
Ali deﬁned a “ransomware process” that starts with in-
fection and the victim recognizing the problem through
the loss of functionality/data.
The victim decides
whether to pay the ransom, leading to functionality/data
being returned or possibly lost for good. In some cases,
the attackers offer an extension or increase the ransom,
returning to the payment decision process. Although this
is a good general illustration of the ransomware response
process, this simpliﬁed decision tree does not take into
account ransom decisions made by business and organi-
zation and how end-users ﬁt within this process.
While there are clear human consequences to ran-
somware attacks, research including users is limited. Re-
demption [21], a recent OS protective mechanism requir-
ing user input on whether to terminate suspicious pro-
cesses was found to have acceptable usability. Forget
et al. [12] describe the circumstances surrounding a ran-
somware infection observed during a longitudinal study,
but this was not the focus of their work.
Shinde et al. [36] conducted a survey with 23 Dutch
end-users and interviews with 2 ransomware victims.
Their results suggest that payment by victims to attackers
is very low due to the victims’ distrust of the attackers.
Furthermore, poor technical knowledge of the payment
methods may create barriers for victims intending to pay
the ransom. Additionally, the survey suggests low aware-
ness of ransomware in corporate settings and that users
rely on IT departments for malware prevention and attack
response. In reality, however, interviewed victims relied
on colleagues for help and continued to be unaware of
possible mitigation strategies after the attack. The study
offered an interesting preliminary look into end-users’
experiences and perceptions of ransomware, but a larger
sample size is needed to conﬁrm the results.
Given the limited research involving users, we seized
this opportunity to collect time-sensitive data in the im-
mediate aftermath of a 2016 ransomware attack.
3 Our Approach
We conducted two studies to understand the impact of
this attack on end-users: an online survey with 150 par-
ticipants (“respondents” hereafter) and interviews with
30 participants (“interviewees” hereafter) who were per-
sonally affected by the attack. Participation was open to
all university students, staff, and faculty members.
Participants were recruited through posters, emails,
and social media. The purpose of the study was dis-

closed as “to understand the effects of the campus-wide
‘network interruption’ on the university community”. To
ensure accurate recollection of the events, we collected
data within six weeks of the initial attack. Both studies
were cleared by our institution’s Research Ethics Board.
4 Survey Methodology
We conducted an anonymous online survey, hosted by
QualtricsTM with 90 females and 60 males (n = 150),
having an average age of 35.6 years. Respondents con-
sisted of students (38%), university staff (31%), and fac-
ulty members (13%) from a wide range of academic
backgrounds; 25% of respondents have a technical back-
ground. Most respondents (77%) used devices with a
Windows operating system on campus; some used Mac
(13%), Linux (8%), or other types (2%) of systems.
We iterated the survey questions and pilot tested them
with colleagues. The survey (see Appendix B) consisted
of multiple choice, 5-point Likert-type questions, and
open-ended questions. It reconstructed and retroactively
assessed participants’ thoughts, emotions and behaviours
during the attack; their post- and pre-attack security prac-
tices; and their impressions on how the university man-
aged the situation and how its emergency protocols for
cyber-attacks can be improved. The survey was done on
a volunteer basis and took approximately 30 minutes—
they were not compensated for their participation.
The researchers summarized quantitative responses
using descriptive statistics. We veriﬁed that the skew-
ness and kurtosis was within ±2, which are acceptable
values for normal univariate distributions [11]. Addition-
ally, we tested whether there are differences in the data
collected from respondents with and without technical
backgrounds. Responses to open-ended questions were
analyzed using Inductive Qualitative Analysis [6]. Dur-
ing the round-1 of coding, one author open-coded qual-
itative survey data. Codes were identiﬁed based on an
inductive approach where the meaning of the codes are
strongly linked to the data [30]. For example, one re-
spondent described how he felt after ﬁnding out about
the attack: “I was pretty upset that [the university] had
not communicated the issues through email or a website
update”. The response was initially coded as Upset. Dur-
ing round-2 of coding, two authors worked together to
review and reﬁne the codes, merging codes with similar
meaning. For example, Round-1 of coding of a question
about prominent feelings during the attack generated 19
codes, which were later reduced to 15 after Round-2. For
instance, the code Upset was merged with Angry to cre-
ate the concatenated code Upset/Angry. After assigning
the codes, they were treated like other nominal or cate-
gorical data. Where appropriate, the frequencies of dif-
ferent responses were counted and reported.

most positive and 1 = most negative.
Impact
5.1
We inquired about the direct impacts of the incident to
gain a sense of the magnitude of the event. We note that
this was a voluntary survey and users who had been di-
rectly infected were probably more likely to respond.
