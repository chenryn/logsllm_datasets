# Plague of Locust
## Description
> > “if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of what is left, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field” (Exodus 10:4-5).
> 
> Prepare yourself! You are about to be attacked by a swarm of locusts, try to stay calm and focus on the picture.
> 
> Note: This is not a reverse challenge
An archive was attached.
## Solution
We extract the archive and get two files:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[~/CTFs/basmach/Plague_of_locust]
└─$ ls -al locust
total 32992
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user     4096 Mar 26 17:43 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 user user     4096 Apr 12 15:10 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 33756326 Mar 20 13:07 script.exe
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user    16348 Mar 20 14:50 ארבה.png
```
We have a Windows executable and a PNG image. Let's run the executable:
```console
PS E:\CTFs\basmach\locust> .\script.exe
- If you wanna play a game ask politely!
- I  couldn't undestand what 'PNG' means
```
Amusingly, the screen gets filled with Locusts until the program is killed. Anyway, the program is complaining that it doesn't understand what "PNG" is. 
In our context, PNG is the format (and extension) of the attached image. The first few bytes of any PNG image contain the `89 50 4E 47` magic signature, 
which essentially contain the string `PNG`. So what happens if we edit the file and replace the magic signature with a different one?
```
89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52 | .PNG........IHDR
->
89 54 45 53 54 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52 | .TEST.......IHDR
```
Run again:
```console
PS E:\CTFs\basmach\locust> .\script.exe
- If you wanna play a game ask politely!
- I  couldn't undestand what 'TEST' means
```
Good! We know how to interact with the program. To make things even easier, moving forward we'll just create a text file called `ארבה.png` and edit it instead.
So, we need to start by asking politely. Instead of `TEST`, we'll use `please`:
```console
PS E:\CTFs\basmach\locust> .\script.exe
- If you wanna play a game ask politely!
please
- aGV5ISBJJ20gZ29pbmcgdG8gYXNrIHlvdSBhIGZldyByaWRkbGVzIGFuZCBpZiB5b3UgY2FuIHNvbHZlIHRoZW0gYWxsIEkgd2lsbCBnaXZlIHlvdSB0aGUgZmxhZyEgdG8gcHJvY2VlZCBqdXN0IHJlcGVhdCB0aGlzIG1lc3NhZ2Uu
```
We made some progress, let's decode the next string using base64 and get:
```
hey! I'm going to ask you a few riddles and if you can solve them all I will give you the flag! to proceed just repeat this message.
```
So, we repeat the message: `hey! I'm going to ask you a few riddles and if you can solve them all I will give you the flag!`
```console
PS E:\CTFs\basmach\locust> .\script.exe
- If you wanna play a game ask politely!

hey! I'm going to ask you a few riddles and if you can solve them all I will give you the flag!
- Let's start easy...
- What is 2 + 2 = ?
```
The answer is obviously `4`.
```console
PS E:\CTFs\basmach\locust> .\script.exe
- If you wanna play a game ask politely!
please
- aGV5ISBJJ20gZ29pbmcgdG8gYXNrIHlvdSBhIGZldyByaWRkbGVzIGFuZCBpZiB5b3UgY2FuIHNvbHZlIHRoZW0gYWxsIEkgd2lsbCBnaXZlIHlvdSB0aGUgZmxhZyEgdG8gcHJvY2VlZCBqdXN0IHJlcGVhdCB0aGlzIG1lc3NhZ2Uu

4
- Beep boop beep beep... I can't find my site on google! what am I missing?
```
It must be related to `robots.txt`.
```console

Everyone knows it's `0`.

```
`john` seems like overkill when we have Google. This is the MD5 hash of `abc123`.

- Finally just XOR !($+ exe` process. [This script](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) helps us do that:

We have a `script.pyc` (compiled bytecode) file, but no sources. Solutions such as `uncompyle6` don't support Python 3.11 yet, but we can at least see the bytecode with the `dis` module:
