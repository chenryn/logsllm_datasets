User: It sounds reasonable that the os/rtos would schedule an "Idle task". In that case, wouldn't it be power consuming? (it sounds reasonable that the idle task will execute: while (true) {} )
Assistant: Historically it's been a lot of different schemes, especially before reducing power consumption in idle was an issue.
Generally there is an "idle" process/task that runs at the lowest priority and hence always gets control when there's nothing else to do.  Many older systems would simply have this process run a "do forever" loop with nothing of consequence in the loop body.  One OS I heard of would run machine diagnostics in the idle process.  A number of early PCs would run a memory refresh routine (since memory needed to be cycled regularly or it would "evaporate").
(A benefit of this scheme is that 100% minus the % CPU used by the idle process gives you the % CPU utilization -- a feature that was appreciated by OS designers.)
But the norm on most modern systems is to either run a "halt" or "wait" instruction or have a special flag in the process control block that even more directly tells the processor to simply stop running and go into power-saving mode.
