It should be noted that there has been recent work ([9, 24, 7,
43, 28]) attacking SSL/TLS as well. Most of these attacks,
however, are not directed at the various cryptographic algo-
rithms used by SSL/TLS, but rather in their implementation
or against the peculiarities of SSL/TLS itself. These attacks
can often be prevented by applying particular patches to
the SSL/TLS software, but we do not have a reliable way of
measuring these preventive measures yet.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have presented the probing SSL security tool (PSST),
and used it to analyze server security on the Internet, eval-
uating over 19,000 servers. Given the volume of sensitive
Internet-based transactions which utilize SSL/TLS servers,
understanding what security measures are in place today to
protect conﬁdential data, and to what degree, is extremely
important. This is particularly true given the rapid pace at
which our understanding of cryptography evolves, and vul-
nerabilities are discovered in protocols previously believed
to be secure. For example, SHA-1 was considered to be
secure and was even recommended by NIST when we ﬁrst
ran our experiments in February 2005. By the time we ran
our experiments in August 2005, SHA-1 was found to have
serious ﬂaws. Our results show that there is great variabil-
ity in the level of cryptographic support in Internet servers
running the SSL/TLS protocol, including a signiﬁcant por-
tion of the servers which support weak, broken, or outdated
cryptography.
In addition to its utility as a security tool, the results gen-
erated using PSST would be useful for SSL/TLS server per-
formance benchmarking. Any eﬀort to improve the perfor-
mance of the cryptographic components of SSL/TLS could
be focused on the most commonly used algorithms.
We see several areas for future work:
• Expired and self-signed certiﬁcates. Murray’s study
from 2001 tested for expired and self-signed certiﬁ-
cates; we plan to extend PSST to test those properties
on our set of servers.

Table 19: Overall Server Security
• Measuring even larger numbers of servers. While our
list of servers is large, CPU power has increased enough
that a large fraction of the available IPV4 address
space could be probed by randomly choosing IP ad-
dresses to test.
• Measuring SSL VPNs. Since the use of SSL for Virtual
Private Networks has been increasing recently, this is
also an area for further investigation.
• SSH Servers. While authentication is handled diﬀer-
ently in SSH than in SSL, many of the cipher suites
utilized are the same. Since SSH is used as the en-
try point into many organizations, its cryptographic
strength should be ensured.
• Client-Side Studies. This work has examined the avail-
able cryptographic strength on the server side. Clearly,
end-to-end security depends on the support of both
sides of the conversation. It would thus be interesting
to evaluate what is being used by clients on the In-
ternet. One way to do this would be to monitor the
packets into and out of a high-volume SSL server (or
cluster of servers).
