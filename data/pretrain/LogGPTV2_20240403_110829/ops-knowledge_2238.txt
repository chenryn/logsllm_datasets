User: I tried using some Unix command using the subprocess module on my Python interpreter installed on a windows 7 OS. However, it errors out saying command not found. It does recognize Windows commands though. Can I somehow use Unix commands in here too?
Thanks,
Vishal
Assistant: You have to install Unix Bash for Windows, but not sure if it works correctly ... Better solution is install or virtualize some Linux distribution.
