Assistant: Whether there is an exception: There is an exception Exception type: Network exception Exception reason/solution: This log records a NIOServerCxn event, which is one of the components in the Zookeeper distributed coordination service and is used to handle operations such as client connections, requests, and responses . In that log, a warning level record appeared, logging an exception describing that an end-of-stream exception was caught. This indicates that there is a problem with the client connection during the communication process, most likely due to an unstable, weak, or packet loss on the network connection. It is recommended to check whether the network connection is normal, confirm that the network status is good, and check the configuration, network connection, and related protocols between the client and server to resolve the exception.
