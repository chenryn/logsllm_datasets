of interest. Wi-Vi uses interference nulling to cancel both the wall
reﬂections and the direct signal from the transmit to the receive an-
tenna, hence increasing its sensitivity to the reﬂections of interest.
4.1 Nulling to Remove the Flash
Recent advances show that MIMO systems can pre-code their
transmissions such that the signal received at a particular antenna
is cancelled [36, 17]. Past work on MIMO has used this property
to enable concurrent transmissions and null interference [26, 22].
We observe that the same technique can be tailored to eliminate
the ﬂash effect as well as the direct signal from the transmit to the
receive antenna, thereby enabling Wi-Vi to capture the reﬂections
from objects of interest with minimal interference.
At a high level, Wi-Vi’s nulling procedure can be divided into
three phases: initial nulling, power boosting, and iterative nulling,
as shown in Alg. 1.
Initial Nulling. In this phase, Wi-Vi performs standard MIMO
nulling. Recall that Wi-Vi has two transmit antennas and one re-
ceive antenna. First, the device transmits a known preamble x only
on its ﬁrst transmit antenna. This preamble is received at the receive
antenna as y = h1x, whereh 1 is the channel between the ﬁrst trans-
mit antenna and the receive antenna. The receiver uses this signal in
order to compute an estimate of the channel ˆh1. Second, the device
transmits the same preamble x, this time only on its second an-
tenna, and uses the received signal to estimate channel ˆh2 between
the second transmit antenna and the receive antenna. Third, Wi-Vi
uses these channel estimates to compute the ratio p = − ˆh1/ ˆh2. Fi-
nally, the two transmit antennas transmit concurrently, where the
ﬁrst antenna transmits x and the second transmits px. Therefore, the
perceived channel at the receiver is:
hres = h1 + h2!−
ˆh1
ˆh2" ≈ 0

In the ideal case, where the estimates ˆh1 and ˆh2 are perfect, the
received signal hres would be equal to zero.
Hence, by the end of this phase Wi-Vi has eliminated the sig-
nals reﬂected off all static objects as well as the direct signal from
the transmit antennas to the receive antenna. If no object moves,
the channel will continue being nulled. However, since RF reﬂec-
tions combine linearly over the medium, if some object moves, its
reﬂections will start showing up in the channel value.
Power Boosting. Simply nulling static reﬂections, however, is
not enough because the signals due to moving objects behind the
wall are too weak. Say, for example, the ﬂash effect was 30 to 40 dB
above the power of reﬂections off moving objects. Even though we
removed the ﬂash effect, we can hardly discern the signal due to
moving objects since it will be immersed in the receiver’s hardware
noise. Thus, we next boost the transmitted signal power.5 Note that
because the channel has already been nulled, i.e., hres ≈ 0, this
increase in power does not saturate the receiver’s ADC. However,
it increases the overall power that traverses the wall, and, hence,
improves the SNR of the signal due to the objects behind the wall.
Iterative Nulling. After boosting the transmit power, residual
reﬂections which were below the ADC quantization level become
measurable. Such reﬂections from static objects can create signiﬁ-
cant clutter in the tracking process if not removed. To address this
issue, Wi-Vi performs a procedure called iterative nulling. At a high
level, the objective is simple: we need to null the signal again af-
ter boosting the power to eliminate the residual reﬂections from
static objects. The challenge, however, is that at this stage, we can-
not separately estimate the channels from each of the two transmit
antennas since, after nulling, we only receive a combined channel.
We also cannot remove the nulling and re-estimate the channels,
because after boosting the power, without nulling, the ADC would
saturate.
However, Wi-Vi can leverage the fact that errors in the channel
estimates are much smaller than the channel estimates themselves,
and use this observation to reﬁne its estimates. Speciﬁcally, by as-
suming that the estimate for h2 is accurate (i.e., ˆh2 = h2), Eq. 1
is left with only one unknown variable h1. By solving for this un-
5In our USRP implementation, we boost the power by 12 dB. This value is
limited by the need to stay within the linear range of the USRP transmitter.
After nulling, we can also boost the receive gain without saturating the re-
ceiver’s ADC. On average, we null 42 dB of the signal, which allows a large
boost in the receive gain.

known variable, we obtain a better estimate of h1. In particular, the
new estimate ˆh1! is:
ˆh!1 = h1 = hres + ˆh1
(2)
Similarly, by assuming that the estimate for h1 is accurate (i.e., ˆh1 =
h1), we can solve Eq. 1 for a ﬁner estimate for h2:
Therefore, Wi-Vi iterates between these two steps to obtain ﬁner
estimates for both h1 and h2, until the two estimates ˆh1 and ˆh2 con-
verge. This iterative nulling algorithm converges exponentially fast.
In particular, in the appendix, we prove the following lemma:

nate the ﬂash effect:
• Besides removing the wall’s reﬂection, it also removes reﬂec-
tions received from other stationary objects both in front of and
behind the wall, such as the table on which the radio is mounted,
the ﬂoor, the radio case itself, etc. In addition, it removes the di-
rect signal from the transmitting antennas to our receive antenna.
Note that the direct channels between Wi-Vi’s transmit anten-
nas and its receive antenna are signiﬁcantly attenuated because
Wi-Vi uses directional transmit and receive antennas focused to-
wards the wall (and away from the direct path).
• Wi-Vi’s nulling algorithm provides a 42 dB mean reduction in
signal power, as shown in §7.6. This reduction is sufﬁcient to re-
move the ﬂash effect from a wide range of wall structures includ-
ing solid wood doors, 6” hollow walls, and most indoor concrete
walls. Further, since Wi-Vi uses directional antennas focused on
the imaged wall, the direct signal from the transmit antennas to
Wi-Vi’s receive antenna is weaker than in typical MIMO sys-
tems, and becomes negligible after nulling.
• Nulling can be performed in the presence of objects moving be-
hind the wall; it can also be performed in the presence of objects
moving in front of the wall as long as they are outside the ﬁeld of
view of Wi-Vi’s directional antennas. Because nulling is mathe-
matically equivalent to subtraction, the presence of such moving
objects leads to a small additive constant at the output of Wi-Vi
after nulling. Such additive constants do not prevent later track-
ing of moving objects.
5.
IDENTIFYING AND TRACKING HUMANS
Now that we have eliminated the impact of static objects in the
environment, we can focus on tracking moving objects. We will
refer to moving objects as humans since they are the primary sub-
jects of interest for our application; however, our system is general,
and can capture other moving bodies.6 Below, we ﬁrst explain how
Wi-Vi tracks the motion of a single human. We then show how to
extend our approach to track multiple moving humans.
5.1 Tracking a Single Human
Most prior through-wall systems track human motion using an
antenna array. They steer the array’s beam to determine the direc-
tion of maximum energy. This direction corresponds to the signal’s
spatial angle of arrival. By tracking that angle in time, they infer
how the object moves in space.
6For example, we have successfully experimented with tracking an iRobot

Figure 2—Time samples as Antenna Arrays. Wi-Vi groups consecutive
time samples into overlapping windows of size w, then treats each window
h[n] . . . h[n + w] as an antenna array. This allows it to track the direction of
a moving object with respect to the receiver.
Wi-Vi, however, avoids using an antenna array for two reasons:
First, in order to obtain a narrow beam and hence achieve a good
resolution, one needs a large antenna array with many antenna ele-
ments. This would result in a bulky and expensive device. Second,
since Wi-Vi eliminates the ﬂash effect using MIMO nulling, adding
multiple receive antennas would require nulling the signal at each
of them. This would require adding more transmit antennas, thus
making the device even bulkier and more expensive.
To capture the beneﬁts of an antenna array while avoiding its
drawbacks, Wi-Vi leverages a technique called inverse synthetic
aperture radar (ISAR). ISAR exploits the movement of the tar-
get to emulate an antenna array. Existing systems which use an-
tenna arrays capture the signal reﬂected off a target from spatially
spaced antennas and processes this information to identify the di-
rection of the target with respect to the array. In contrast, in ISAR,
there is only one receive antenna; hence, at any point in time,
the receiver captures a single measurement. However, as the target
moves, he/she samples the received signal at successive locations
in space, as if we had a receive antenna at each of these points. Fur-
thermore, because of channel reciprocity, successive time samples
received by Wi-Vi correspond to successive spatial locations of the
moving target. Hence, Wi-Vi effectively receives in time what an
antenna array would receive in space. By treating consecutive time
samples as spatial samples, Wi-Vi can emulate an antenna array and
use it to track motion behind the wall.
In what follows, we formalize the above discussion. Let y[n] be
the signal sample received by Wi-Vi at a discrete time point n. De-
ﬁne the spatial angle θ as the angle between the line connecting the
human to Wi-Vi and the normal to the motion, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Note that the sign of θ is positive when the vector from the human
to Wi-Vi and the vector of the motion are in the same direction, and
negative when these two vectors are in opposite directions.
We are interested in computing A[θ, n], a function that measures
the signal along the spatial direction θ at time n. To compute this
value, Wi-Vi ﬁrst processes the received samples to remove the ef-
fect of the transmitted signal, and obtain the channel as a func-
tion of time, i.e., h[n] = y[n]/x[n]. To emulate an antenna array
of size w, Wi-Vi considers w consecutive channel measurements
h[n] . . .h[n + w], as shown in Fig. 2. Wi-Vi then computes A[θ, n]
by applying standard antenna array equations [34] as follows:
A[θ, n] =
h[n + i]ej 2π
λ i∆ sin θ,
(4)
w%i=1
where λ is the wavelength, and ∆ is the spatial separation between
successive antennas in the array.7 At any point in time n, the value
of θ that produces the highest value in A[θ, n] will correspond to the
direction along which the object is moving.
To compute A[θ, n] from the above equation, we need to estimate
∆, the antenna spacing in the emulated array. Since human motion
emulates the antennas in the array, ∆=vT , whereT is Wi-Vi’s
7∆ is twice the one-way separation to account for the round-trip time.

mental setup of a trial which consisted of a single person moving around in

sampling period, and v is the velocity of the motion. Of course,
Wi-Vi does not know the exact speed at which the human is mov-
ing. However, the range of speeds that humans have in a conﬁned
room is fairly narrow. Hence, we can substitute a value for v that
matches comfortable walking (our default is v = 1m/s [10]). Note
that errors in the value of v translate to an underestimation or an
overestimation of the exact direction of the human.8 Errors in ve-
locity, however, do not prevent Wi-Vi from tracking that the human
is moving closer (i.e., angle is positive) or moving away from the
Wi-Vi device (angle is negative). In other words, because we do not
know the exact v, we cannot pinpoint the location of the human, but
we can track her/his relative movements.
Fig. 3 shows results from one of our experiments. In particular,
3(a) shows a diagram of the movement, and 3(b) plots the mag-
nitude of A[θ, n] (in dB) as a heat map. There are two lines in
Fig. 3(b): the ﬁrst one is a zero line, which represents the DC (i.e.,
the average energy from static elements).9 This line is present re-
gardless of the number of moving objects. Second, there is a curved
line with a changing angle. This line tracks the human motion.
Around n = 0 seconds, the person starts moving towards the Wi-Vi
device. As a result, the spatial angle θ is positive and decreasing. (It
is positive because the vector of motion and the line from the hu-
man to Wi-Vi are in the same direction, and it is decreasing because
the absolute angle between the normal on the motion and the line

rection of motion at 30◦ when the actual direction was 40◦ but she was
moving at a speed around 1.2m/s
9Recall that nulling mitigates these reﬂections so that they do not saturate
the receiver’s ADC, enabling Wi-Vi to register the minute channel variations
due to moving objects behind the wall. However, minuscule errors in chan-
nel estimates during the nulling phase would still be registered as a residual
DC by Wi-Vi.

person crosses in front of the Wi-Vi device, at which time his an-
gle becomes zero. From n = 1.8s to n = 3s, the person is moving
away from Wi-Vi, and hence, his angle is negative. But the abso-
lute value of the angle is decreasing. At n = 3, the person turns and
starts moving inward, causing the angle to go back toward zero,
but the signal becomes weaker as he is now relatively far from the
Wi-Vi receiver.10
5.2 Tracking Multiple Humans
In this section, we show how Wi-Vi extends its tracking proce-
dure to multiple humans. Our previous discussion about using hu-
man motion to emulate an antenna array still holds. However, each
human will emulate a separate antenna array. Since Wi-Vi has a
single antenna, the received signal will be a superposition of the
antenna arrays of the moving humans. In particular, instead of hav-
ing one curved line as in Fig. 3(b), at any time, there will be as
many curved lines as moving humans at that point in time.
However, with multiple humans, the noise increases signiﬁ-
cantly. On one hand, each human is not just one object because of
different body parts moving in a loosely coupled way. On the other
hand, the signal reﬂected off all of these humans is correlated in
time, since they all reﬂect the transmitted signal. The lack of inde-
pendence between the reﬂected signals is important. For example,
the reﬂections of two humans may combine systematically to dim
each other over some period of time.
The problem of disentangling correlated super-imposed signals
is well studied in signal processing. The basic approach for process-
ing such signals relies on the smoothed MUSIC algorithm [31, 39].
Similar to the standard antenna array processing in Eq. 4, smoothed
MUSIC computes the power received along a particular direction,
which we call A![θ, n] because it estimates the same function in
Eq. 4 but in manner more resilient to noise and correlated sig-
nals [34].
For a given antenna array h = (h[n], . . ., h[n + w]) of size w,
MUSIC ﬁrst computes the w × w correlation matrix R[n]:
R[n] =E [hhH],
(5)
where H refers to the hermitian (conjugate transpose) of the vector.
It then performs an eigen decomposition of R[n] to remove the noise
and keep the strongest eigenvectors, which in our case correspond
to the few moving humans, as well as the DC value. For example, in
the presence of only one human, MUSIC would produce one main
eigenvector (in addition to the DC eigenvector). On the other hand,
if 2 or 3 humans were present, it would discover 2 or 3 eigenvectors
with large eigenvalues (in addition to the DC eigenvector). MUSIC
partitions the eigenvector matrix U[n] into 2 subspaces: the signal
space US[n] and the noise space UN[n], where the signal space is the
span of the signal eigenvectors, and the noise space is the span of
the noise eigenvectors. MUSIC then projects all directions θ on the
null space, then takes the inverse. This causes the θ’s corresponding
to the real signals (i.e., moving humans) to spike. More formally,
10Interestingly, even when the direction of motion is perpendicular to the line
connecting the person to the device, Wi-Vi registers this motion (note how
the DC line is much wider at n = 5 than at n = 0). This is because Eq. 4
approximates Wi-Vi as a monostatic radar, i.e., it simpliﬁes the model by
