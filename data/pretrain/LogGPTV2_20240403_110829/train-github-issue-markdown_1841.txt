The text editor is a little buggy. Every time I go to the next challenge I
have to reset the code in order to get the text-editor to be responsive.
Specific issues with the text editor include: inability to select a line of
code, clicking on a line and having it select the line below, navigating with
the arrow keys will often result in a hard return to the next line while half-
way through.
I've had this issue on the last 20+ challenges. I've closed out my browser,
closed tabs, refreshed the page and reset the code. None of these permanently
solve the issue. I've talked with other coders and they are running into the
same issue too.
Challenge Call out Optional Actions with Button Info has an issue.
