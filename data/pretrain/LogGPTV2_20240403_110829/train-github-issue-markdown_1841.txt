### Issue Report: Text Editor Bugs

**Description:**
I have encountered several issues with the text editor while working on coding challenges. The primary problem is that the text editor becomes unresponsive, and I need to reset the code each time I move to a new challenge to regain functionality.

**Specific Issues:**
1. **Inability to Select a Line of Code:** When I attempt to select a line, it often selects the line below instead.
2. **Navigation Problems:** Using the arrow keys frequently results in an unintended hard return to the next line, even when I am only halfway through the current line.

**Reproducibility:**
- This issue has persisted across the last 20+ challenges.
- I have tried closing my browser, closing tabs, refreshing the page, and resetting the code, but none of these actions have permanently resolved the problem.
- Other coders I have spoken to are experiencing the same issues.

**Additional Information:**
- **User Agent:** `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/57.0.2987.133 Safari/537.36`
- **Affected Challenge:** "Optional Actions with Button Info"

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open the coding challenge in the specified environment.
2. Attempt to select a line of code using the mouse or navigate using the arrow keys.
3. Observe the described issues (inability to select the correct line, unintended hard returns).

**Screenshots:**
If possible, please include links to screenshots that demonstrate the issues.

**Code Example:**
```html
<div>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <a href="#">Click here for cat photos.</a>
  <button>Like</button>
  <h2>Things cats love:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>

  <h2>Top 3 things cats hate:</h2>

    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>

    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</div>
```
