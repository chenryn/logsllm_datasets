User: I am looking for the exe file for Anaconda Prompt, I am looking C:\Anaconda3\Scripts and don't know what it's named?
Assistant: Check your start menu, it should be there. Its a link named "Anaconda Prompt", that links to %windir%\system32\cmd.exe "/K" C:\...\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat C:\...\Anaconda3, it's executed in C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\SPB_16.6
