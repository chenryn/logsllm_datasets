Question: Consider the challenges associated with securing the interface between an application and its libraries in a web browser context. What are the potential consequences of not properly sandboxing a library within a large application like Firefox?
"A": "If a library is not properly sandboxed, it may cause the application to lose its ability to render web pages correctly.",
"B": "A compromised library might be able to cause out-of-bounds memory reads or writes in code outside the sandbox.",
"C": "Unsandboxed libraries could lead to the application inadvertently leaking Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) information to an untrusted library.",
"D": "Failure to sandbox a library could lead to double-fetch bugs where a compromised library can modify a value between two checks in the application code."
