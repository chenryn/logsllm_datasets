## Abstract
Smartphones are increasingly used to store users' identities and sensitive information. Therefore, it is crucial to authenticate legitimate users and block imposters. This paper demonstrates that keystroke dynamics can be effectively used for accurate user identification on smartphones. We collected and analyzed keystroke data from 25 diverse smartphone users, selecting six distinguishing features for user identification. These features, which include key hold time and error rate, along with four custom features for multiplexed keys, are well-suited for a fuzzy classifier. We optimized the classifier using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to adapt to variations in usage patterns. Additionally, we propose a novel PIN verification mode to enhance information security. Our experiments show an average error rate of 2% after the detection mode, with the false rejection rate dropping to zero in the PIN verification mode. The proposed technique outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for user identification on desktop computers.

## 1. Introduction
Smartphones have become integral to both personal and professional environments, storing sensitive information such as emails, credit card numbers, and passwords. This makes them attractive targets for identity theft. Despite the need for robust user identification, current methods, such as PINs and token-based authentication, are not effective on smartphones due to their resource constraints and the dynamic nature of mobile usage. In this paper, we propose a keystroke-based user identification system that requires no additional hardware and is user-friendly. We collect and analyze keystroke data from 25 diverse users, including researchers, students, and professionals, and select six distinguishing features for user identification. We use a fuzzy classifier optimized with PSO and GA to handle the highly diffused feature space. Our system operates in three modes: Learning, Imposter Detection, and Verification. Performance evaluation shows that our system achieves an average error rate of 2% and significantly outperforms existing techniques.

## 2. Related Work
Keystroke dynamics for user authentication has been studied extensively for desktop computers, focusing on inter-keystroke latency and digraphs. Early studies by Umphress and Williams (1985) and Williams and Leggett (1987) achieved FARs of 6% and 5%, respectively. Later, Leggett et al. (1990) introduced dynamic verification, achieving an FAR of 12.8% and FRR of 11.1%. Joyce and Gupta (1990) used statistical methods to achieve an FAR of 0.25% but a high FRR of 16.67%. Bleha et al. (1990) used Bayes classification, achieving an FRR of 8.1% and FAR of 2.8%. Obaidat and Sadoun (1997) introduced key hold times as a new feature. BioPassword is a commercial application using keystroke dynamics. However, these studies focused on desktops. Clarke et al. (2007) used neural networks for mobile phones, achieving varying FARs and FRRs. Our work extends this to a more comprehensive and adaptive system for smartphones.

## 3. Data Acquisition
We developed an application for Symbian OS 3rd Edition to log keystroke data. The application runs in the background, logging all key presses and release times. We collected data from 25 diverse users, including teenagers, corporate executives, and senior citizens, using various Nokia models. The dataset includes key hold times, horizontal and vertical digraphs, and error rates. The diversity in the dataset ensures robustness in the identification system.

## 4. Feature Selection and Analysis
We selected six distinguishing keystroke features: key hold time, error rate, and four custom features for multiplexed keys. These features were chosen based on their ability to differentiate between users. We compared these features with those used in existing desktop schemes and found that they are more challenging to use on smartphones due to the small keypad and variable usage patterns. The hybrid PSO-GA optimized fuzzy classifier was able to handle the diffused feature space effectively.

## 5. System Architecture
Our system operates in three modes:
1. **Learning Mode**: Trains a fuzzy classifier using PSO and GA to map keystroke features to user profiles.
2. **Imposter Detection Mode**: Uses the trained classifier to classify real-time keystrokes and detect imposters.
3. **Verification Mode**: Invoked if an imposter is detected or for document transmission, requiring the user to type a memorized PIN. The system analyzes the typing behavior to verify the user.

## 6. Performance Evaluation
Performance evaluation on the collected dataset shows that the proposed system achieves an average error rate of 2% after the detection mode and an FRR close to zero after the verification mode. We compared our system with five state-of-the-art keystroke-based user identification techniques and found that our system provides significantly better accuracy in detecting both legitimate users and imposters.

## 7. Limitations and Future Work
The proposed system has limitations, such as the need for a large dataset and the potential for false positives. Future work will focus on improving the system's robustness and reducing false positive rates. Additionally, we will explore the integration of other biometric features to further enhance security.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our keystroke-based user identification system for smartphones is a robust and effective solution for authenticating legitimate users and blocking imposters. The system, which uses a fuzzy classifier optimized with PSO and GA, achieves high accuracy and outperforms existing techniques. Future research will aim to address the current limitations and enhance the system's performance.
