by Facebook [15]. Next, we tested whether each generated
ID mapped to a real proﬁle by probing the proﬁle page using
this ID. Finally, if the proﬁle existed, we included the proﬁle
ID in the random sample only if this proﬁle was not isolated.
We deﬁne an isolated user proﬁle as a proﬁle that does not
display its “friends list” or has no friends of Facebook.
We deployed the simple two-state native controller and the
three-phase, many-state master controller. We acknowledge,
however, that more sophisticated controllers could be used
that, for instance, employ some machine learning algorithms
in order to improve the potential inﬁltration.
4.3 Operating the Facebook SbN
We operated the Facebook SbN for 8 weeks. The social-
bots were able to send a total of 8,570 friendship requests,
out of which 3,055 requests were accepted by the inﬁltrated
users. We divide the following discussion according to the
three phases of the master controller.
Setup
4.3.1
We created 102 socialbots and a single botmaster, all of
which are physically hosted on one machine for simplicity.
A botherder, however, could resort to a more sophisticated
deployment such as a P2P overlay network. Even though
we could have built the socialbots automatically using the
botworker, we decided to create them manually as we had no
intention to support any CAPTCHA-breaking business. In
total, we created 49 socialbots that had male user proﬁles
(referred to as m-socialbots), and 53 socialbots that had
female user proﬁles (referred to as f -socialbots).
4.3.2 Bootstrapping
The socialbots generated a random sample of 5, 053 valid
proﬁle IDs. These IDs passed the inclusion criteria we dis-
cussed in Section 4.2. Figure 3 shows the degree distribution
of this sample.4
Based on a pilot study, we decided to send 25 friendship
requests per socialbot per day in order to avoid CAPTCHAs.
The socialbots took 2 days to send friendship requests to all
of the 5, 053 proﬁles. In total, exactly 2, 391 requests were
sent from m-socialbots and 2, 662 from f -socialbots. We
kept monitoring the status of the requests for 6 days. Over-
all, 976 requests were accepted with an average acceptance
rate of 19.3%. In particular, 381 of the accepted requests
were sent from m-socialbots (15.9% acceptance rate), and
595 were sent from f -socialbots (22.3% acceptance rate).
About 86% of the inﬁltrated proﬁles accepted the requests
within the ﬁrst three days of the requests being sent, as
shown in Figure 4. Overall, the SbN spent two weeks in the
bootstrapping phase. For most of that time, however, the
SbN was setting idle.

the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these
degrees over the whole network (or a sample of it).

4.3.3 Propagation
We kept the SbN running for another 6 weeks. During this
time, the socialbots added 3, 517 more user proﬁles from
their extended neighborhoods, out of which 2, 079 proﬁles
were successfully inﬁltrated. This resulted in an average ac-
ceptance rate of 59.1%, which, interestingly, depends on how
many mutual friends the socialbots had with the inﬁltrated
users, and can increase up to 80% as shown in Figure 5.
By the end of the eighth week, we decided to take the
SbN down as it resulted in a heavy traﬃc with Facebook.
In total, the SbN generated approximately 250GB inbound
and 3GB outbound traﬃc. We consider the operation time a
conservative estimate of the real performance of the SbN as
we paused it several times for debugging and data analysis,
especially during the bootstrapping phase. We believe that
operating the SbN for a longer time is expected to increase
the average acceptance rate as the propagation phase will
have a higher contribution.
4.4 Harvested Data
As the socialbots inﬁltrated Facebook, they harvested a
large set of users’ data. We were able to collect news feeds,
users’ proﬁle information, and “wall” messages. We decided,
however, to only focus on users’ data that have monetary
value such as Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII).
After excluding all remaining friendships between the so-
cialbot, the total size of all direct neighborhoods of the so-
cialbots was 3,055 proﬁles. The total size of all extended
neighborhoods, on the other hand, was as large as 1,085,785
proﬁles.
In Table 3, we compare users’ data revelation of
some PII before and after operating the SbN, as a percent-
age of the neighborhoods size.
To emphasize its signiﬁcance, we visualize the data reve-
lation diﬀerence of selected proﬁle information in Figure 6.
We include all user proﬁles from both the direct and the ex-
tended neighborhoods of the socialbots, which added up to
1,088,840 proﬁles. Each bar in the ﬁgure is annotated with
two numbers in x/y format, where x and y represent the
number of proﬁles with accessible proﬁle information before
and after a large-scale inﬁltration, respectively.
5. DISCUSSION
In what follows, we discuss the results presented in the
previous section and focus on four main points: the observed
users’ behavior, the eﬀectiveness of the Facebook Immune
System, the inﬁltration performance of the socialbots, and
the expected implications on other software systems.

5.1 Users’ Behavior
Given the results presented in Section 4, someone might
ask: are the inﬁltrated proﬁles real after all, or are they
just other socailbots? To begin with, notice that during the
bootstrapping phase, the socialbots targeted proﬁles that
were picked at random out of millions of user proﬁles, and
thus, it is highly unlikely to have picked mostly socialbots.
We also support this argument by the following analysis of
the observed users’ behavior. First of all, consider Figure 5.
The big jump in the acceptance rate from users who were
picked at random to those with whom the socialbots had
some mutual friends is expected.
It directly exhibits the
eﬀect of the triadic closure principle, which predicts that
having mutual friends will improve the liklihood of accepting
a friendship request as discussed in Section 3.4.2. The triadic
closure, interestingly, also operated from the users side; the
socialbots received a total of 331 friendship requests from
their extended neighborhoods.
Second, the behavior depicted in Figure 4 matches the
oﬃcial statistics about real users on Facebook: 50% of the
750 million active Facebook users log on in any given day [3],
and thus, it is expected that approximately half of the ac-
cepted friendship requests are observed within one day of
the requests being sent.
Third and last, the users who were inﬁltrated during the
bootstrapping phase, that is, those who were selected at
random, showed another expected behavior [39]: the more
friends they had, the higher the chance was that they ac-
cepted a friendship request from a socialbot (i.e., a stranger),
as shown in Figure 7.

5.2 SbN vs. Facebook Immune System
The Facebook Immune System (FIS) is a coherent, scal-
able, and extensible real-time adversarial learning system
that is deployed by Facebook to protect its users and the
social graph from malicious activities [36]. It performs real-
time checks and classiﬁcation on every read and write action
on Facebook database. An interesting question now follows:
how did the FIS perform against the SbN we have operated?
After operating the SbN for 8 weeks, only 20 proﬁles used
by the socialbots were blocked by the FIS, and interestingly,
all of them were controlled by f -socialbots. After further
investigation, we found that these proﬁles were blocked be-
cause some Facebook users ﬂagged them as spam.5 In fact,
we did not observe any evidence that the FIS detected what
was really going on other than relying on users’ feedback,
which seems to be an essential but potentially dangerous
component of the FIS.
In reaction, we asked ourselves: what assumptions are
made by the FIS that might be problematic? The answer
came directly from the authors of the FIS: they state that
“fake accounts have limited virality because they are not cen-
tral nodes in the graph and lack trusted connections. They
also have no unique data or history” [36]. Hence, we con-
jecture that the FIS does not consider fake accounts as a
real threat. Fake accounts, however, are one of the main
OSN vulnerabilities that allow a botherder to run a large-
scale inﬁltration campaign. Detecting and blocking such
accounts—as early as possible—is the main challenge that
OSN security defenses like the FIS have to overcome in oder
to win the battle against an SbN.
Finally, we noticed that employing the commands cluster
and status_update, which we describe in Table 2, had a
desirable eﬀect. It appears that the socialbots seemed more
human-like as only 20% of the 102 proﬁles they controlled
got blocked, as apposed to 93% of the 15 proﬁles we used in
our pilot study where we decided not to use these commands.
This, in a sense, reﬂects one of the drawbacks of relying on
users’ feedback.
5.3 Inﬁltration Performance
One way to judge whether the resulting inﬁltration was
the making of a small number of “outstanding” socialbots is
to compare them in terms of the number of proﬁles they have
