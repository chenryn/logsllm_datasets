which includes a purely imaginary part that is π/2 phase-
shifted from b(t). As a result, the amplitude equals to
|H{b(t)}| = A(t), where the periodical part sin(2πfct + φ)
is no longer present. The envelope adjustment is done by
matching the envelopes of the native narrowband and the
forged narrowband in the following form:
ˆbh(t) =
|H{bh(t)}|
|H{bs(t)}| bs(t),
(12)
where bs(t) is the alien narrowband signal (source), and bh(t)
is the native narrowband signal (host). Examples of bs(t)
and |H{bh(t)}| are shown in Fig. 11(a) and Fig. 11(b), and
the resulting narrowband is given in Fig.11(c). It is clear
that the narrowband from the alien signal has been adjusted
with a matched envelope. The spectrogram after envelope

respectively, where ¯B is the average value of B(n) in a seg-
ment. We plot the two statistics corresponding to unforged
and forged signals for Day 1 and Day 2 in Fig. 10(a) and
Fig. 10(b), respectively. We can see that both the unforged
and the forged signals have stable statistics on the two days,
and unforged and forged signals show noticeably separable
statistics values. Therefore, if we are given any of these two
unforged recordings as reference, we can detect anti-forensics
over the other recording by checking the consistency of the
statistics. This idea of reference-based anti-forensics detec-
tion can be further augmented by incorporating other useful
statistics.

IMPROVING ANTI-FORENSIC
OPERATIONS
Being aware of the anti-forensics detection methods pro-
posed in Section 4, the adversary will naturally improve the
anti-forensic operations. In this section, we examine a few
possible methods toward this goal, and discuss their trade-
oﬀs.
To cope with the inter-frequency consistency check, the
adversary can alter multiple ENF harmonic frequencies. Two
issues have to be addressed by the adversary. First, the al-
teration has to be performed with regard to possible signal
quality degradation. This is because altering the ENF sig-
nal at higher harmonics involves applying bandstop ﬁlter-
ing by the adversary’s anti-forensic operations to the audio

adjustment is given by Fig. 12, which no longer exhibits the
spectrogram inconsistency as in Fig. 9.
Envelope adjustment may cause some loss of ﬁdelity in the
embedded ENF signal, which can be seen in the following
experiment. We perform the narrowband transplantation
proposed in Section 3.2 on 13 diﬀerent audio ﬁles. Specif-
ically, for each audio ﬁle, we extract the narrowband from
another arbitrarily chosen ﬁle and transplant the extracted
narrowband into the audio ﬁle as described in Section 3.2.
For these 13 audio ﬁles, We ﬁrst calculate the normalized
correlation between the ENF signal present in the alien nar-
rowband and the ENF signal in the forged narrowband. We
then perform envelope adjustment and also calculate the
normalized correlation between the ENF signal in the alien
narrowband and the ENF signal in envelope-adjusted nar-
rowband. As shown in Fig. 13, the normalized correlation
reduces from a value close to 1 to about 0.6 as a result of
the envelope adjustment. That is, the envelope adjustment
introduces distortion to the ENF, which suggests that an
adversary only has limited capabilities of preserving the ﬁ-
delity of the spectrogram and embedded ENF signal at the
same time.
5.2 Matching the Statistics
We have seen in Section 4.4 that due to the limited ﬁ-
delity of ENF embedding, anti-forensic operations may be
detectable with the aid of certain statistics from a refer-
ence signal. As such, an adversary also has the incentive to
match the statistics. We have found that the envelope ad-
justment technique discussed in Section 5.1 can eﬀectively
match the two variance and kurtosis statistics, as shown in
Fig. 14. However, while the adversary matches these two
statistics, some other statistics may be aﬀected. Fig. 15
shows the peak magnitude at 60Hz on the FFT result with
and without envelope adjustment. We can see that, enve-
lope adjustment consistently increases the peak magnitude,
which can be exploited accordingly by the forensic analyst to
detect anti-forensic operations. This phenomenon is funda-
mental and indicates that some mismatch always takes place
if the adversary only has limited knowledge about how ENF
is formed in an audio signal. For both forensic analysts and
adversaries, it is therefore crucial to acquire a deeper under-
standing of ENF’s underlying mechanism so as to mimic or
to scrutinize the ﬁdelity of ENF embedding. The relations

INTERPLAY BETWEEN FORENSIC
ANALYST AND ADVERSARY
Summarizing our proposed forensic and anti-forensic op-
erations developed upon empirical data, we can see a highly
dynamic interaction between the forensic analyst and the
adversary. In this section, we consider such an interaction
from two perspectives. The ﬁrst perspective treats the inter-
action as an evolutionary process, in which both the foren-
sic analyst and the adversary improve their actions grad-
ually in response to each other’s action. We then present
a game-theoretic perspective, formulating a game between
the forensic analyst and the adversary that highlights the
fundamental relation between the players.
6.1 An Evolutionary Perspective
In a security context, system defenders and attackers ex-
ploit vulnerabilities in each other’s solutions and advance
their own solutions. There is always an evolution between
the two parties, which has been observed in many practical
scenarios such as computer virus v.s. anti-virus competition
[7] and the “arms race” for attacking v.s. securing online rep-
utation systems [12]. In a similar spirit, such an evolution
can also be observed in ENF analysis, resulting in strategies
436from simple to complex.
listed below have taken place in this paper:
Indeed, technical advancements
1. A forensic analyst extracts ENF at the fundamental
frequency (e.g., 60Hz). This is suﬃcient since the ENF
signal is stronger compared to the narrowband at the
fundamental frequency so ENF extraction is accurate,
and the forensic analyst does not examine harmonic
frequencies that will incur additional complexity.
2. Given the practice in the previous step, an adversary
naturally alters the ENF signal at the fundamental
frequency using anti-forensic operations proposed in
Section 3 such as ENF signal removal and embedding.
3. In the presence of the adversary, the forensic analyst is
now motivated to extract the ENF signal from other
harmonic frequencies to examine the inter-frequency
consistency, at the cost of higher complexity.
4. In response to the forensic analyst, the adversary also
has to make cohesive changes to the ENF signal at
higher harmonic frequencies. However, the adversary
takes the risk of distorting the host audio signal and
has a higher chance of being caught by the reference-
based detection.
5. The forensic analyst now has to take into account more
advanced detection methods at additional costs, such
as checking the spectrogram consistency.
6. In response to the forensic analyst, the adversary can
increase the spectrogram consistency via envelope ad-
justment. However, this may sacriﬁce the ENF ﬁdelity.
7. Given that the adversary has addressed the blind de-
tection methods, the forensic analyst can resort to
non-blind detection such as checking the ENF embed-
ding statistics, which involves the use of reference sig-
nals. The means that the forensic analyst can improve
his/her capability if more resources are available.
8. In response to the forensic analyst, the adversary now
improves the ENF embedding ﬁdelity by matching the
statistics at the analyst’s disposal. However, we have
seen that matching a subset of the statistics may lead
to mismatch of other statistics, and it is diﬃcult to
perfectly replicate the authentic ENF formation pro-
cess.
9. Now the forensic analyst has to seek additional anti-
forensics detection methods. The interplay continues.
As this paper is the ﬁrst step regarding anti-forensics and
countermeasures of ENF analysis, we expect that such evolu-
tion will continue, and increasingly more sophisticated anti-
forensic strategies and countermeasures will emerge, push-
ing forward the research that improves the security of the
ENF-based time stamp.
6.2 A Game-Theoretic Perspective
The interplay between the forensic analyst and adversary
in the ENF analysis can be further understood under a
game-theoretic framework that is extended from the work in
[11]. Consider that the forensic analyst (denoted by Player
FA) extracts the ENF signal at the fundamental frequency
(e.g., 60Hz). Due to the possible presence of the adversary
(denoted by Player AD) who would perform anti-forensic
operations upon the audio signal, Player FA cannot simply
trust the extracted ENF signal until an anti-forensics de-
tector conﬁrms its authenticity. As an illustrative example,
assume that Player AD performs ENF embedding proposed
in Section 3.2.
A detector can be characterized by its structure and per-
formance metrics. In this paper, we consider a composite
construction of anti-forensics detectors. Speciﬁcally, con-
sider a total of N individual detectors Di, 1 ≤ i ≤ N , each
relying on diﬀerent signal characteristics to generate a bi-
nary output (T/F) with respect to an input audio signal.
An overall anti-forensics detector Dall can be constructed
using a simple OR-rule:
(cid:8)
Dall =
T,
F,
if Di = T for any 1 ≤ i ≤ N,
otherwise.
(13)
Note that in practice, the detector has constraints on its
aﬀordable complexity and the available resources, which de-
termine the individual detectors that can be incorporated
into the overall detector. The performance of the detector
is measured in terms of its detection probability and false
alarm probability. It is well known in detection and decision
theory that there is a trade-oﬀ between these two probabili-
ties of a given detector: the false alarm probability increases
as the detection probability increases. For a total false alarm
probability Pf,all allowed for Dall, Player FA’s strategy se-
lects and conﬁgures individual detectors so that the total
false alarm probability equals to Pf,all.
On the other hand, in response to Player FA’s anti-forensics
detection, Player AD will seek to hide the traces of anti-
forensics. There may also be complexity and resource con-
straints imposed on Player AD’s actions, and Player AD
has to select his/her strategy under the constraints so that
Player FA’s detection capability is minimized while the em-
bedded ENF signal is maximally preserved. Given a pair
of Player FA and AD’s strategies, the utility that Player
FA will maximize is the total detection probability of anti-
forensics Pd,all. In contrast, Player AD’s utility is to mini-
mize Pd,all, with additional penalty when distortion is intro-
duced to the ENF signal that Player AD intends to embed.
The speciﬁc operations proposed in Section 4 and 5 can be
studied under the game-theoretic formulation. In terms of
Player FA’s detector construction, if more strict constraints
on complexity and resources are imposed, then Player FA
may only use the low-complexity inter-frequency consistency
check as the anti-forensics detector. If a higher complexity is
permitted, then the spectrogram consistency detector can be
incorporated into the overall detector. Furthermore, if the
resources accessible to Player FA are enhanced, for example
via the reference signal or via an improved understanding of
the ENF mechanism, then Player FA can construct an even
more sophisticated detector. On Player AD’s side, alter-
ing ENF in multiple frequencies is cost-eﬀective against the
inter-frequency consistency check, but cannot resist other
types of anti-forensics detection. Nonetheless, if higher com-
plexity is allowed for Player AD, he/she can employ envelope
adjustment to reduce the anti-forensics detection probabil-
ity, although at the same time, the embedded ENF signal
may suﬀer from distortion. Similar to Player FA, if more
resources, in particular an improved knowledge of the ENF
embedding, are available to Player AD, then Player AD can
437also improve the anti-forensic capability. Our ongoing work
builds on the understanding of the strategy space of Player
FA and Player AD from this paper, and is evaluating the
utilities of both players either analytically or numerically,
so that the Nash equilibrium strategies can be determined.
This will lead to an understanding of the stable interplay
pattern between the two players.
7. CONCLUSIONS
The time stamp based on the Electrical Network Fre-
quency (ENF) has been shown to be a promising tool for
authenticating digital audio and video recordings. However,
as in many other scenarios of computer and communication
security, the existence of adversaries raises a serious concern
regarding the security of the ENF-based time stamp and
makes it crucial to understand and address possible vulnera-
bilities in ENF analysis against anti-forensic actions. In this
paper, we have investigated anti-forensic operations that can
remove and alter the ENF signal present in a host audio sig-
nal. We have developed a mathematical framework for ENF
modiﬁcation, which not only entails the eﬀectiveness of ENF
modiﬁcation and challenges of anti-forensics detection, but
also motivates detection methods from a forensic analyst’s
point of view. Improvements over the anti-forensic opera-
tions in response to the anti-forensics detection are further
proposed and their corresponding trade-oﬀs are discussed.
To understand the highly dynamic nature of the forensic
analyst-adversary interplay, we have developed an evolution-
ary perspective and a game-theoretic perspective, which can
be used to characterize a wide range of actions that may take
place.
Our ongoing work includes experiments that cover a vari-
ety of testing conditions, including diﬀerent geographic areas
and recording devices, and the evaluation of utility func-
tions associated with diﬀerent players in our proposed game
formulation. In view of the potential employment of ENF
analysis for media data authentication, we envision that its
security will receive increasing attention, and research along
this direction will contribute to more secure and reliable time
stamp schemes based on ENF analysis.
