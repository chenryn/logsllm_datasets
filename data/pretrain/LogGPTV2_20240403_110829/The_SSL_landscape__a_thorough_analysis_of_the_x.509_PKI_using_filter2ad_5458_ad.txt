### Root Store and Error Code 21
Error code 21 indicates that only a single certificate was sent, which is insufficient for a complete certification chain. Certificate pinning has been suggested as a solution in such cases. This approach mimics the trust model of SSH, where the host key is accepted as valid upon the first encounter, and the client remembers this key for future verification.

### Domain Names in Certificates
Figure 7 illustrates the most frequently used domain names in the subjects of certificates across multiple hosts. The finding that many of these certificates are not correctly chained or do not match the host name is concerning, especially given the popularity of some of these hosting providers.

For example, `www.snakeoil.dom` is a standard certificate for the Apache Web server, often appearing due to default configurations. Further investigation into certificates occurring at least 1,000 times revealed that they primarily belong to web hosting companies. We will explore the issues of domain names in subject fields and the correctness of certificates in the following sections.

### Validity of Certification Chains
Several factors determine whether a browser should accept a certificate as valid:
- **Completeness and Correctness of the Chain:** The chain must be complete, leading to a Root Certificate in the browser's Root Store.
- **Expiration and Signature Verification:** No certificate in the chain should be expired, and all signatures must be verifiable.

A broken chain can occur for various reasons. We investigated the correctness of chains using the Firefox Root Store from the official developer repositories at the time of the scan. A missing Root Certificate means the certificate is not valid in a default Firefox, but the Root Store can be reconfigured to include the required Root Certificate. Some CAs, like CACert.org, are not included in Root Stores despite being considered trustworthy by many.

**Error Codes:**
- **Error Code 32:** Indicates that one or more certificates in the chain are marked as not to be used for issuing other certificates.
- **Error Code 21:** Indicates that only one certificate was sent (i.e., no chain).

Some certificates had broken or nonsensical validity periods, with less than 10 occurrences in any scan, so we did not investigate them further. We also found cases where signatures were incorrect and could not be verified, with ratios between 0.01% and 0.1%.

### Trust Chain Validity
Figure 8 shows that trust chains were valid in about 60% of cases during active scans. Expired certificates (about 18%) and self-signed certificates (about 25%) were the most frequent errors. The number of valid certificates did not change significantly when considering distinct certificates, indicating that the issuance and deployment of certificates with valid trust chains are consistent.

Between November 2009 and April 2011, the numbers remained constant, even as the Alexa list entries changed. This suggests that the PKI landscape with respect to valid certificates remains stable, which is a poor finding as no improvement is observed.

**Error Code 20:** Increased in frequency to around 8% in April 2011, with no known reason. Error codes 19 and 32 occurred very rarely.

### Comparison with Other Data Sets
We compared our findings with data from Santa Barbara and Shanghai and found similar results. For MON1 and MON2, the situation was different, with a higher number of valid chains in MON2 (83.07%) compared to MON1 (57.94%). The number of errors due to expired certificates or Error 20 decreased, but no immediate explanation was found.

Comparing our results with the EFF data set, which represents the global view for the IPv4 space, we found that the ratio of self-signed certificates is much higher in the EFF data set. This is expected, as certification can be costly, and operators of lower-ranking sites may opt for self-issued certificates or use default certificates from common web servers like Apache.

### Correct Host Name in Certificate
The second major factor in determining whether a certificate should be accepted is the correct identification of the certified entity. The client must verify that the subject of the certificate matches the DNS name of the server. In X.509 terminology, the subject field must be a Distinguished Name (DN), and the Common Name (CN) is part of the DN. A DNS name is commonly stored in the CN, but it can also be placed in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.

We checked if the CN attribute in the certificate subject matched the server’s host name, and then if the SAN matched. Certificates with correct chains where CN or SAN match are called "absolutely valid." Wildcarded CN or SAN fields were interpreted according to RFC 2818, with a single * not matching, in accordance with Firefox's behavior.

In TUM-Apr2011, only 119,648 out of 829,707 certificates had CNs that matched the host name. Allowing Subject Alternative Names increased this number to 174,620. When restricted to certificates with correct chains, the numbers were 101,238 (correct host name in CN) and 149,900 (correct host name in CN or SAN), corresponding to just 18.07% of all certificates. Enabling SNI did not change the picture, with 149,451 (18.09%) certificates having both valid chains and correct host names.

### Unusual Host Names in the Common Name
We encountered unusual host names, such as 'plesk' in 60,201 cases (TUM-Apr2011-SNI). Our hypothesis is that this is a standard certificate used by the Parallels/Plesk virtualization and web hosting environment. Testing this, we found that 15,000 variants of a Plesk Panel site stated "site/domain/host not configured" or similar. Given that standard passwords for Plesk Panel sites are easily available, this is problematic. Certificates issued for localhost were found 38,784 times, but neither 'plesk' nor localhost certificates had valid chains.

### Host Names in Self-Signed Certificates
Server operators may issue self-signed certificates, saving certification costs but requiring users to trust the certificate. The value of self-signed certificates is debatable, with some viewing them as useful in a Trust-On-First-Use security model, while others see them as contrary to X.509 goals. In TUM-Apr2011-SNI, 97.78% of CNs in self-signed certificates did not match the host name. Subject Alternative Names matched in 0.5% of cases but were rarely used (1.65% of certificates). The top 3 CNs accounted for more than 50% of the different CNs, with 'plesk' in 27.30% and localhost or localhost.localdomain in 25.39%. Most CNs occurred only 1-4 times.

### Extended Validation (EV)
Technically, a user should verify that the domain in the CN or SAN matches and that other information in the certificate correctly identifies the entity on an organizational level. This is the purpose of Extended Validation (EV) certificates, which are issued under CA/Browser-Forum regulations. An object identifier in the certificate identifies it as EV, and browsers signal EV status to the user (e.g., via a green highlight in the address bar).

Table 3 shows the deployment of EV certificates over time and from different locations. There is a slight trend towards more EV certificates, but they are not widespread. For the top 10,000 hosts in TUM-Apr2011, the ratio of EV certificates was 8.93%, and for the top 1,000 hosts, it was 8.11%. For the top 100, it was 8.33%, and for the top 50, it was 5.17%. This is partly because Google, which dominates the top 50, does not use EV, and some well-known websites (e.g., Amazon and eBay) use different hosts for logins, which use EV.

### Length of Certification Chain
As explained, the probability of negligence and errors increases with a high number of intermediate certificates if they are not subject to the same control as within the Root CA. Servers sometimes send more certificates than needed, potentially reducing performance.

We computed the length of certification chains by counting only those certificates in the chain that were neither the end-host certificate, Root Certificates, nor self-signed intermediate certificates. Figure 9 shows the result for two scans and one monitoring run from Germany, and a comparison with the EFF data set. The majority of certificates are verified through a chain of length ≤ 3, with the cutoff at ≤ 2 for the EFF data. More than half of the certificates have a chain length of 0, likely due to the large fraction of self-signed certificates.

Comparing Tue-Nov2009 to TUM-Apr2011, the share of chains of length 0 decreased, while the share of chains with length ≥ 1 increased by about 20%. The graph and the increased average chain length (0.52 for Tue-Nov2009 vs. 0.67 for TUM-Apr2011) indicate a weak tendency to employ more intermediate certificates. Overall, certification chains remain short, which is a positive development.
