### Summary
When transforming response data via AxiosRequestConfig.transformResponse,
there is no way to drive transformation logic differently depending on the
HTTP status of the response.
This is a problem for me because I want to implement a transform that
transforms only successful responses. Successful responses (in 200 range) are
guaranteed to contain data in a well-defined format that I want to transform,
but unsuccessful responses may contain a variety of response data structures
(dependent on the type of error) that I want to pass-through my transform
without modification so that they can be later processed by a more generic
error response handler.
Implementing my transform to detect what type of structure is in the response
based on the response data alone is impractical. The API I am working with
clearly defines the structure of the response for each HTTP status code it may
respond with, so there's no reason that I should have to reverse-engineer what
kind of response it is by inspecting the response data (and it may not even be
possible to do so unambiguously).
Some options:
#### Pass HTTP status code to AxiosRequestConfig.transformResponse (most
useful option IMO)
Pros:
  * Allows for granularity of transforming data differently based on status code.
Cons:
  * Requires duplicating logic to decide whether response code is success vs error if that's all you care about (maybe this could be solved by also passing a "success" boolean?).
  * Introduces a difference in signature for transformResponse vs transformRequest, which may complicate some of the existing design/code that essentially treats them both the same.
#### Add 2 new options to AxiosRequestConfig:
  * transformSuccessResponse: transforms response data ONLY for success responses
  * transformErrorResponse: transforms response data ONLY for error responses.
Pros:
  * Makes use of existing determination of which status codes are considered success vs error.
Cons:
  * Missing granularity for converting different response data structures for different error status codes.
  * Requires backward compatibility for continuing to use transformResponse for all responses.
