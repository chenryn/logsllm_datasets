User:  company needs to purchase a set of network security equipment, including firewall, intrusion detection system, anti-virus software, etc. Please provide a selection scheme of safety equipment, and explain the cooperation principle between each equipment.
Assistant: According to the requirements, we recommend the following equipment: 1. Firewall: It is recommended to choose enterprise-level firewalls, such as Cisco ASA, Fortinet FortiGate, etc., which have the characteristics of high performance, multi-function, and easy management. 2. Intrusion detection system: It is recommended to use open source intrusion detection systems such as Snort and Suricata. These systems can detect suspicious activity on the network based on specific rules or behavioral analysis and issue an alert. In addition, the intrusion detection system can also be integrated with other security devices such as firewalls to implement network traffic monitoring and attack response. 3. Anti-virus software: It is recommended to choose well-known enterprise-level anti-virus software, such as Symantec Endpoint Protection, TrendMicro OfficeScan, etc., which have the characteristics of timely updates, multiple defenses, and support for centralized management. These devices can cooperate in the following ways: 1. Firewall and intrusion detection system: The intrusion detection system can capture network traffic through the mirror port of the firewall or the built-in SPAN/RSPAN function, and then analyze and find suspected intrusion attacks. If the intrusion detection system has an alarm event, it can be passed to the firewall and trigger corresponding defense measures, such as blocking the source address of the attack. 2. Intrusion detection system and anti-virus software: Some intrusion activities are carried out by malicious programs. Through the file hash inspection or activity tracking of the intrusion detection system, malicious files can be found and uploaded to anti-virus software for detection and processing. 3. Firewall and anti-virus software: The firewall can detect and block malicious files and links entering from the Internet through its own integrated anti-virus engine. In addition, when there are suspicious hosts or traffic in the network, the firewall can pass relevant alarm information to anti-virus software for detection and response.
