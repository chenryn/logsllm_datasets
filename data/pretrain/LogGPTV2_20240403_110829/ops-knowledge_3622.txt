User: We need to build a Docker-based development environment. Please list at least three commonly used Docker commands, and explain their usage and function respectively.
Assistant: 1. docker run Usage: docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] Function: run a new container and start a command. 2. docker build Usage: docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | - Function: Build the image according to the Dockerfile. 3. docker-compose up Usage: docker-compose up [OPTIONS] Function: Use configuration files to start multiple containers. Multiple services can be specified at the same time, and Docker Compose will automatically start the prerequisite services, and build and start the application's services in the specified order.
