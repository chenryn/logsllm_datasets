ATT&CK ID:M1047
ATT&CK Technique Name:Audit
Administrators should audit all cloud and container accounts to ensure that they are necessary and that the permissions granted to them are appropriate.  Additionally, administrators should perform an audit of all OAuth applications and the permissions they have been granted to access organizational data. This should be done extensively on all applications in order to establish a baseline, followed up on with periodic audits of new or updated applications. Suspicious applications should be investigated and removed.
