Abstract—Trustworthy and usable healthcare requires not
only effective disease diagnostic procedures to ensure delivery of
rapid and accurate outcomes, but also lightweight user privacy-
preserving capabilities for resource-limited medical sensing de-
vices. In this paper, we present MedSen, a portable, inexpensive
and secure smartphone-based biomarker1 detection sensor to
provide users with easy-to-use real-time disease diagnostic capa-
bilities without the need for in-person clinical visits. To minimize
the deployment cost and size without sacriﬁcing the diagnostic
accuracy, security and time requirement, MedSen operates as a
dongle to the user’s smartphone and leverages the smartphone’s
computational capabilities for its real-time data processing. From
the security viewpoint, MedSen introduces a new hardware-level
trusted sensing framework, built in the sensor, to encrypt mea-
sured analog signals related to cell counting in the patient’s blood
sample, at the data acquisition point. To protect the user privacy,
MedSen’s in-sensor encryption scheme conceals the user’s private
information before sending them out for cloud-based medical
diagnostics analysis. The analysis outcomes are sent back to Med-
Sen for decryption and user notiﬁcations. Additionally, MedSen
introduces cyto-coded passwords to authenticate the user to the
cloud server without the need for explicit screen password entry.
Each user’s password constitutes a predetermined number of
synthetic beads with different dielectric characteristics. MedSen
mixes the password beads with the user’s blood before submitting
the data for diagnostics analysis. The cloud server authenticates
the user based on the statistics and characteristics of the beads
with the blood sample, and links the user’s identity to the
encrypted analysis outcomes. We have implemented a real-world
working prototype of MedSen through bio-sensor fabrication
and smartphone app (Android) implementations. Our results
show that MedSen can reliably classify different users based
on their cyto-coded passwords with high accuracy. MedSen’s
built-in analog signal encryption guarantees the user’s privacy by
considering the smartphone and cloud server possibly untrusted
(curious but honest). MedSen’s end-to-end time requirement for
disease diagnostics is approximately 0.2 seconds on average.

INTRODUCTION
Healthcare management and delivery costs in developed
countries are skyrocketing. In response to this trend, federal
agencies have supported diverse lines of applied research in the
use of technology for health monitoring and intervention [22],
[30]. The intention is to take advantage of state-of-the-art
technologies to compile information about medical health
securely and in real-time and thereby transition from reactive,
hospital-centered to preventive and patient-centered, and cost-
effective health care and management with greater focus on
well-being.
More speciﬁcally,
the deployment of an ideal medical
1A biomarker, or biological marker, generally refers to a measurable
indicator of some biological state or condition such as human disease. For
example, the overabundance of certain blood cell types or biomolecular levels
may indicate an infection.
diagnostics solution necessitates satisfaction of three core
requirements: i) portability and low-cost. Ease-of-use and user
convenience requires a portable solution so that the users, e.g.,
elderly patients with regular diagnostic/testing prescriptions,
can get
themselves tested without having to make hospi-
tal visits. Additionally, replacing legacy inexpensive (though
sometimes tedious) clinical testing calls for a low-cost solution
that can be purchased and used by ordinary civilians;
ii)
accuracy and performance. Due to their importance and poten-
tial life-changing impact, the correctness of medical diagnosis
outcomes, e.g., HIV testing, is crucial. Furthermore, because
of the same reasons, patients are often willing to pay higher
rates for more accelerated testing procedures. Consequently,
the proposed solution must satisfy both needs.
iii) usable
security and privacy guarantees. Based on Gallup Poll for the
Institute for Health Freedom [12], 70% of the respondents were
concerned about the conﬁdentiality of their medical records
[8]. Potentially sensitive information disclosure may result in
undesired consequences such as insurance premium raises and
negative social affects.
Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics by taking advantage of
miniaturized devices and mobile technology can dramatically
increase the role patients take in their own health care, and
consequently reduce health care costs. POC diagnostics refer
to in-vitro diagnostic tests that do not require the involvement
of laboratory staff and facilities to make results available both
to the medical professional and the patient [10], [15], [19]. The
possibility of integrating POC systems with mobile platforms
have been very recently demonstrated through the diagnosis
of a series of conditions including vitamin-D deﬁciency and
Kaposi’s Sarcoma disease [21], [23], [25]. At the same time,
the recently increasing popularity of using information tech-
nologies for healthcare has attracted cyber criminals to this
area as well, giving birth to various types of malware and
adversarial intrusions against medical critical infrastructures.
The number of data breaches across healthcare sectors have
increased by 30% during the last year [17]. As a result, while
the availability of mobile-based POC diagnostics systems to
the public creates great opportunities in the health care domain,
it will be associated with serious privacy and security concerns,
due to vulnerabilities on the cyber side.
To address the requirements associated with portability, ac-
curacy and security for smartphone-based POCs, in this paper,
we present MedSen, an integrated trustworthy POC diagnostics
solution, as a portable device plugged into smartphones, that
provides end-users with real-time local medical diagnostics,
while maintaining privacy guarantees.
As a running example, in the proposed work we will focus
on a POC system that utilizes impedance cytometry to provide
blood cell counting for medical diagnostic and disease stag-
ing information. Cytometry and particle quantiﬁcation have

been extensively used for the diagnosis of a wide range of
pathological conditions such as cancer and infectious (both
viral and bacterial) diseases [3], [14], [20], [24], [26], [32],
[33]. Therefore, MedSen’s design is broadly applicable to a
large number of medical diagnostics devices, as they begin to
become integrated with smartphones.
The development of MedSen’s proposed POC secure diag-
nostics solution consisted of two major research tasks: First,
we designed and implemented a microﬂuidic bio-sensor that
would enable innovative hardware-based analog signal encod-
ing for biomarker detection. MedSen makes use of hardware-
level multi-electrode excitation to implement cryptographic
one-time padding encryption to realize trustworthy analog
signal encryption.
Second, we designed and deployed a new medical cyto-
coded password and authentication scheme for POC devices.
Each password consists of a speciﬁc secret ratio of micron-
sized synthetic beads, that will be mixed with individual’s
blood sample. Feeding the mixture to the POC devices will
constitute the autonomous authentication mechanism without
the user’s explicit password entry that prevents the cyber
intruders from accessing patient’s sensitive medical results.
The contributions of this paper are the following: i) We
introduce a new portable medical diagnostics solution that
leverages smartphone and cloud computational capabilities for
heavyweight data processing of bio-sensor measurements. ii)
We present a domain-speciﬁc usable security and authenti-
cation technique for POC medical devices via cyto-coded
passwords. The proposed scheme removes the need for tra-
ditional explicit password entries by the users. iii) We propose
a user privacy-preserving algorithm for medical healthcare
platforms through in-sensor built-in analog signal encryption
and decryption schemes. Similar to digital homomorphic cryp-
tographic solutions, the proposed framework allows for cloud-
based signal processing on encrypted measurements. iv) We
have implemented a real-world integrated working prototype of
the proposed algorithms and designs. Our empirical evaluation
results prove the deployability of MedSen in real practical
settings.
MedSen’s sensor encrypts the analog signals using an
embedded micro-controller. MedSen’s software-based diagnos-
tics data processing runs on either Android v4.1 (for smaller
datasets) or a cloud server that runs Matlab framework.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
MedSen’s components and how they are interconnected logi-
cally. Sections III-V explain in details the design of MedSen’s
individual components and how they provide their correspond-
ing functionality. Section VI describes fabrication procedures
and details of system integration to implement MedSen for
disease diagnostics. Section VII presents our empirical and
integrated evaluation of MedSen’s components in real-world
settings including using real blood cells. Section VIII reviews
the most related existing work and discusses how MedSen
addresses their shortcomings in terms of portability, security,
and real-time diagnostics. Section IX concludes the paper.
II. OVERVIEW
MedSen provides a new portable privacy-preserving mi-
croﬂuidic biomarker detection sensor for cost-effective human
disease diagnosis and management using smartphone computa-
tional resources. MedSen leverages cytometry [27] to measure

the capacitance is short circuited. This prompts the resistance
to dominate the impedance. We desire to operate in the regime
where resistance is dominant since we are measuring changes
in ionic resistance resulting from the presence of beads in
between the electrodes. Each bead or cell passing by results
in a single peak in the output voltage.
B. Multi-Electrode Signal Encryption
MedSen expands the simple impedance cytometer and uses
multiple electrodes with multiple inputs shorted together and
multiple independent outputs. This results in multiple peaks as
each cell or particle passes by. The individual outputs are used
as the key component in our biomedical microelectromechani-
cal system (BioMEMS)-based signal encryption. The output
of the electrodes can be selected or discarded through the
multiplexer by the (pseudo-)random selection of a micro-
controller. The signals of the independent output electrodes
can be randomly switched on or off through a multiplexer chip.
The details of signal encryption using random keying of output
electrodes are described in Section IV. The repeated readings
of cell impedance of a single cell when passing through the
electrode pairs in the bio-sensor can be manipulated to a
random sequence of peaks response by arbitrarily selecting
the outputs from the electrodes pairs. Figure 4 describes the
operation model of the integrated system. This results in a
randomly varying number of peaks for each bead passing
by. A potential eavesdropper, without access to the signal
encryption key, will not be able to discern the true number of
beads that have passed by. The number of beads is a crucial
parameter for disease diagnostics analyses. For instance, the
white blood CD-4 cell count is the strongest predictor of
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) progression in lab tests
nowadays.
We designed the microﬂuidic channel with integrated
multi-electrode pair conﬁguration to mask the number of peak
count for passing cells in microﬂuidic channel to protect user
privacy and security in diagnostic devices against conﬁden-
tiality attacks. Figure 5 shows the computed aided design
(CAD) of the microﬂuidic bio-sensor. Figures 5a and 5b show
the designs of multiple bio-sensors embedded along a single
Fig. 3. Model of operation of planar electrode pair. The electrode-electrolyte
interface is modeled by the double layer capacitance. The electrical impedance
in the channel ﬂuctuates as the cell/bead passing between the measurement
electrodes.
For authentication, the user’s blood sample is mixed with a
user-speciﬁc number of artiﬁcial beads before passing through
the MedSen’s sensor (Figure 2). The peaks caused by the
artiﬁcial beads differ in amplitude from the peaks caused by
the true biomarker cells and can be distinguished on the server
side. Based on the number of counted artiﬁcial beads, the
server authenticates the user (similar to password checking)
