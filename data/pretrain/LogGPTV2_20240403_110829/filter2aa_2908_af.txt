Networking 
8.1. 
LAN networking 
Wired LAN with DHCP should work out of the box on most systems. In some cases, 
e.g. under VMware, it can sometimes happen that the interface eth0 is not up after 
booting. The following procedure shows you how to troubleshoot connectivity 
problems. For simplicity reasons the example shown here are based on the network 
interface ID eth0. For your particular system it can be different. 
• First check if your network cable is attached and if the LEDs on your network 
card or switch port are turn on. 
• See if eth0 is listed: ifconfig 
• If in the resulting list eth0 is missing then try to start up the interface: 
ifconfig eth0 up 
• Check again if eth0 is up: ifconfig 
• When the interface is showing up you can start the DHCP agent: dhcpcd eth0 
• Check if a dynamic IP address was assigned: ifconfig 
• If there no IP address was assigned, repeat the previous four steps. 
8.2. 
Wireless Networking 
8.2.1. Kernel Supported Drivers 
Since not every wireless card has open source drivers, setting up wireless LAN can be 
difficult. But the first thing is to try if any the kernel supported drivers work. For 
simplicity reasons the example shown here are based on the network interface ID eth0. 
For your particular system it can be different, e.g. it can be wlan0 or ath0. 
• First make sure that wireless is enabled in your BIOS and activated. On some 
systems, like the Lenovo ThinkPad T60, it is required to turn on wireless by 
moving the switch located on the outside of you notebook into the On position. 
On others you can use a keyboard function shortcut to enable wireless, e.g. on 
a Dell Inspiron it is Fn-F2. 
• Boot DAVIX in KDE mode and open a console. 
98 / 111 
• Then check if a wireless interface is available: iwconfig 
root@slax:~# iwconfig 
lo        no wireless extensions. 
eth0      unassociated  ESSID:off/any 
          Mode:Managed  Channel=0  Access Point: Not-Associated 
          Bit Rate:0 kb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   Sensitivity=8/0 
          Retry limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off 
          Encryption key:off 
          Power Management:off 
          Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0 
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0 
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:218   Missed beacon:0 
eth1      no wireless extensions. 
• Before being able to scan you have to startup the wireless device with the 
command: ifconfig eth0 up 
• Then you can scan for wireless LANs using: iwlist eth0  scan 
• After a while a list of available Wireless access points will be visible. If you 
favorite on is missing redo the scan. 
root@slax:~# iwlist eth0 scan 
eth0      Scan completed : 
          Cell 04 - Address: 00:DE:AD:BE:EF:00 
                    ESSID:"xxx" 
                    Protocol:IEEE 802.11b 
                    Mode:Master 
                    Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1) 
                    Encryption key:off 
                    Bit Rates:1 Mb/s; 2 Mb/s; 5.5 Mb/s; 11 Mb/s 
                    Quality=83/100  Signal level=-83 dBm 
                    Extra: Last beacon: 184ms ago 
• If your access point requires a WEP key then enter: 
iwconfig eth0 key dead-beaf-dead-beaf-dead-beaf-de 
• To attach to your desired access point with ESSID xxx use the following 
command: iwconfig eth0 essid "xxx" 
• Then start the DHCP agent: dhcpcd eth0 
• Check if dynamic IP address was assigned: ifconfig 
• If it does not work retry the previous 7 steps.

8.2.2. NDISwrapper 
If the steps in the previous chapters do not work out for you, you can try to get 
wireless running with the NDIS Drivers. DAVIX supports the ndiswrapper, which 
allows you using the Windows NDIS Drivers. 
For details on you particular wireless card see NDISwrapper home page17 and other 
third party websites. 
Known issues: 
• Not all vendor drivers support the promiscuous mode in their wireless drivers. 
It can therefore be that sniffing network traffic of other system on the network 
is not possible.

Graphic Cards 
9.1. 
OpenGL 
The underlying SLAX distribution supports many graphic cards. Thus, DAVIX 
should work in most systems. There is one big limitation: Open GL runs in simulation 
mode only. This can lead to situation, that applications that heavily rely on OpenGL, 
e.g. like GoogleEarth, behave really slowly. But for most visualization tools found on 
DAVIX there should not be any problems to expected 
If you want to have better performance you have to install the vendor supported 
graphic card drivers. Check the vendor web sites for details18:

S3

SIS 
http://www.sis.com/support/support_prodid.htm 
Since these vendor drivers have very stringent licensing conditions it is not possible to 
distribute them with DAVIX. 
9.2. 
Multi-Head Support 
If you want to run DAVIX with two or more screens it is most of the time required to 
use the vendor supplied graphic card driver. For vendor web sites see the URL list in 
chapter OpenGL. 
For configuration hints check the README and INSTALL files coming along the 
vendor driver packages.

FAQ 
Q: What does DAVIX stand for? 
A: DAVIX is an abbreviation for "Data Analysis and VIsualization LinuX®". 
Q: Which Linux distribution is DAVIX based on? 
A: DAVIX utilizes the SLAX 6.0.x as a base. 
Q: Which OS did you use as a build system for your modules? 
A: A full installation of Slackware 12.0 and dropline Gnome 2.20.0 was used for 
compiling applications from source code. Several DAVIX packages have been 
directly taken from the Slackware distribution and have been converted with tgz2lzm 
to SLAX packages. 
Q: What is the difference between DAVIX and BackTrack: 
A: BackTrack is very focused on penetration testing. Although several tools can be 
found in both distributions, DAVIX concentrates on the aspects of data mining and 
visualization. 
Q: How can I provide a download mirror for DAVIX? 
A: Create a cron job with following command and report the HTTP or FTP download 
URL to us: jan.monsch ät iplosion.com 
rsync -av 82.197.185.121::davix /to/wherever/it/goes/on/your/sever 
Q: Where can I report a bug or a feature request? 
A: We utilize Google Code for bug tracking. To report a bug you are required to 
create a Google account. Our project URL is: http://code.google.com/p/davix/ 
Q: Can I build DAVIX from ground up? 
A: Currently, the build scripts do not allow automated building of the CD. Therefore 
we refrain from publishing the scripts. When we have fixed the build environment we 
will certainly publish the build scripts.
