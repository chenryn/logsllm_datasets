### Networking

#### 8.1. LAN Networking

Wired LAN with DHCP should work out of the box on most systems. However, in some cases, such as under VMware, the interface `eth0` may not be up after booting. Follow these steps to troubleshoot connectivity issues:

1. Check if your network cable is attached and if the LEDs on your network card or switch port are lit.
2. Verify if `eth0` is listed by running: `ifconfig`
3. If `eth0` is missing, try to start the interface: `ifconfig eth0 up`
4. Check again if `eth0` is up: `ifconfig`
5. Start the DHCP agent: `dhcpcd eth0`
6. Check if a dynamic IP address was assigned: `ifconfig`
7. If no IP address was assigned, repeat the previous four steps.

#### 8.2. Wireless Networking

##### 8.2.1. Kernel Supported Drivers

Not all wireless cards have open-source drivers, making setup challenging. First, try using kernel-supported drivers. For simplicity, the examples here use `eth0`, but your system may differ (e.g., `wlan0` or `ath0`).

1. Ensure wireless is enabled in your BIOS and activated. On some systems, like the Lenovo ThinkPad T60, you need to move the external switch to the "On" position. On others, use a keyboard function shortcut (e.g., Fn-F2 on a Dell Inspiron).
2. Boot DAVIX in KDE mode and open a console.
3. Check if a wireless interface is available: `iwconfig`
4. Startup the wireless device: `ifconfig eth0 up`
5. Scan for wireless LANs: `iwlist eth0 scan`
6. If your access point requires a WEP key, enter: `iwconfig eth0 key dead-beaf-dead-beaf-dead-beaf-de`
7. Attach to the desired access point: `iwconfig eth0 essid "xxx"`
8. Start the DHCP agent: `dhcpcd eth0`
9. Check if a dynamic IP address was assigned: `ifconfig`
10. If it does not work, retry the previous seven steps.

##### 8.2.2. NDISwrapper

If the above steps do not work, try using NDISwrapper to run Windows NDIS drivers. For details, see the [NDISwrapper homepage](http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/).

**Known Issues**:
- Not all vendor drivers support promiscuous mode, which may prevent sniffing network traffic.

### Graphic Cards

#### 9.1. OpenGL

DAVIX supports many graphic cards, but OpenGL runs in simulation mode, which can slow down applications that rely heavily on OpenGL (e.g., Google Earth). For better performance, install vendor-specific drivers. Check the vendor websites for details:

- **3DLabs**: [Drivers](http://www.3dlabs.com/support/drivers/)
- **ATI**: [Drivers](http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html)
- **Elsa**: [Drivers](http://www.elsa.com/EN/Support/driver_gladiac.asp)
- **Intel**: [Drivers](http://support.intel.com/support/graphics)
- **Matrox**: [Drivers](http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/latest/home.cfm)
- **NVIDIA**: [Drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp)
- **S3**: [Drivers](http://www.s3graphics.com/drivers.jsp)
- **SIS**: [Drivers](http://www.sis.com/support/support_prodid.htm)

Vendor drivers have stringent licensing conditions, so they cannot be distributed with DAVIX.

#### 9.2. Multi-Head Support

For multi-screen setups, use vendor-supplied graphic card drivers. Refer to the URLs in the OpenGL section for more information. Check the README and INSTALL files included with the vendor driver packages for configuration hints.

### FAQ

**Q: What does DAVIX stand for?**
- **A**: DAVIX stands for "Data Analysis and VIsualization LinuX®."

**Q: Which Linux distribution is DAVIX based on?**
- **A**: DAVIX is based on SLAX 6.0.x.

**Q: Which OS did you use as a build system for your modules?**
- **A**: A full installation of Slackware 12.0 and Dropline Gnome 2.20.0 was used for compiling applications from source code. Some DAVIX packages were directly taken from the Slackware distribution and converted to SLAX packages using `tgz2lzm`.

**Q: What is the difference between DAVIX and BackTrack?**
- **A**: BackTrack is focused on penetration testing, while DAVIX concentrates on data mining and visualization.

**Q: How can I provide a download mirror for DAVIX?**
- **A**: Create a cron job with the following command and report the HTTP or FTP download URL to us: `jan.monsch ät iplosion.com`
  - Command: `rsync -av 82.197.185.121::davix /to/wherever/it/goes/on/your/sever`

**Q: Where can I report a bug or a feature request?**
- **A**: Use Google Code for bug tracking. To report a bug, create a Google account and visit our project URL: [Google Code Project](http://code.google.com/p/davix/)

**Q: Can I build DAVIX from the ground up?**
- **A**: Currently, the build scripts do not allow automated building of the CD. We will publish the build scripts once the build environment is fixed.
