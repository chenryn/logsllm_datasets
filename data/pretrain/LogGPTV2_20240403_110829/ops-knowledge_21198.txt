User: I am using Google App Engine in Python.
In My database, I have some Entity which contain score of user. So I wanted to make a page on the ranking of a particular user. To do that, I need to get the 5 user with the higher score than that user and 5 user with lower score than that user, and also the position of that particular user in the database. I could use the cursor() method to get the encoded cursor. But, I cannot get the 5 Entity before the user's identity and even so, I cannot get the position of the user in the database. Maybe I can use the offset to do the query, but How to get the offset of an Entity?
Assistant: Why not query the data twice?  Once for users with a higher score, in descending order.  Once for users with a lower score.  Fetch five records in each query.
