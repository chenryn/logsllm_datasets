To effectively implement CIS Control 17.3, "Establish and Maintain an Enterprise Process for Reporting Incidents," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Define the Reporting Process:**
   - Establish a clear and structured process for employees to report security incidents.
   - Specify the timeframe within which incidents must be reported.
   - Identify the designated personnel or teams to whom incidents should be reported.
   - Define the mechanisms for reporting (e.g., email, incident management system, phone).
   - Outline the minimum information required in each report, such as the nature of the incident, time and date, and any relevant evidence.

2. **Communicate the Process:**
   - Ensure that the incident reporting process is clearly communicated and easily accessible to all employees.
   - Provide training and awareness programs to educate the workforce on the importance of incident reporting and how to use the established mechanisms.

3. **Review and Update:**
   - Conduct an annual review of the incident reporting process to ensure it remains effective and up-to-date.
   - Update the process as needed, especially in response to significant changes in the organization that could impact the safeguard, such as new technologies, organizational restructuring, or regulatory requirements.

4. **CIS Control Details:**
   - CIS Control 17.3 does not have a specific asset type (N/A).
   - This control falls under the security function of "Respond," which focuses on the organization's ability to respond to and manage security incidents.

By following these procedures, an organization can establish a robust and reliable process for incident reporting, enhancing its overall security posture and enabling a more effective response to security threats.
