for transitions from q?. When M L enters q?, it checks whether the
contents of the oracle tape are in L. If so, M L moves to qyes. Oth-
erwise, M L moves to qno. In other words, M L is given the ability
to “instantaneously” determine whether a string is in L or not.
Polynomial Hierarchy
The polynomial hierarchy provides
a more detailed way of classifying NP-hard decision prob-
lems. The complexity classes in this hierarchy are denoted by
ΣkP, ΠkP, ∆kP, where k is a nonnegative integer. They are
deﬁned as follows:
Σ0P = Π0P = ∆0P = P,
and for all k ≥ 0,
∆k+1P = PΣkP,
Σk+1P = NPΣkP,
Πk+1P = co-Σk+1P = coNPΣkP.
Some classes in the hierarchy are
∆1P = P , Σ1P = NP , Π1P = coNP,
∆2P = PNP, Σ2P = NPNP,
Π2P = coNPNP.

any non-empty subset of {u1,··· , uk} satisﬁes (

A dominating set in G corresponds to a set of users that to-

spect to φ if and only if U has a subset U(cid:48) that can be divided
into k pairwise disjoint sets, each of which have role membership
of r1, r2,··· , rn. Therefore, the answer to the Domatic Number

Proof of Lemma 10: SAFE(cid:104)⊗,(cid:116)(cid:105) is NP-hard.

assume that Si (cid:54)⊆ Sj if i (cid:54)= j.

Without loss of generality, assume that S1,··· , Sk are k pair-
wise disjoint sets. Then, U1,··· , Uk are k pairwise disjoint sets of
users. U1 satisﬁes φ1, and thus satisﬁes φ(cid:48). Similarly, we have Ui
satisﬁes φ(cid:48) for every i from 1 to k. Since Ui ⊆ U, U is safe with
respect to φ.
On the other hand, suppose U is safe with respect to φ. Then,
U has a subset U(cid:48) that can be divided into k pairwise disjoint sets
ˆU1,··· , ˆUk, such that ˆUi satisﬁes φi. In order to satisfy φ(cid:48), ˆUi
must satisfy a certain φai and hence be equivalent to Uai. The
assumption that ˆU1,··· , ˆUk are pairwise disjoint indicates that
Ua1 ,··· , Uak are also pairwise disjoint. Therefore, their corre-
sponding sets Sa1 ,··· , Sak are pairwise disjoint. The answer to
the Set Packing problem is “yes”.

each occurrence of ∨ with (cid:116).
Note that X is safe with respect to φ1(cid:116)φ2 if and only if X is safe
respect to either φ1 or φ2, and X is safe with respect to φ1 (cid:175) φ2 if
and only if X is safe respect to both φ1 and φ2. Thus the logical

On the other hand, if (cid:104)U, UR, UP(cid:105) is not safe with respect to
sp(cid:104){p1, p2,··· , pn}, φ(cid:105), then there exists a set X of users that

PROOF. We can reduce the NP-complete SET COVERING
problem to the complement of SSC(cid:104)⊗(cid:105). In Set Covering problem,
we are given a family F = {S1,··· , Sm} of subsets of a ﬁnite set
S = {e1,··· , en} and a budget K, where K is an integer smaller
than m and n. We are asking for a set of K sets in F whose union
is S.
Given an instance of the Set Covering problem, construct a state
(cid:104)U, UR, UP(cid:105) such that UR = {(ui, ri) | i ∈ [1, m]} and UP =
{(ui, pj) | ej ∈ Si}. Construct a safety policy sp(cid:104)P, φ(cid:105), where
P = {p1,··· , pn} and φ = (
K+1 All). φ is satisﬁed by any set
of no less than K + 1 users.
On the one hand, if (cid:104)U, UR, UP(cid:105) is safe, no K users together
have all permissions in P . In this case, since ui corresponds to Si,
there does not exist K sets in F whose union is S. The answer to
the Set Covering problem is “no”.
On the other hand, if (cid:104)U, UR, UP(cid:105) is not safe, there exist a set
of no more than K users together have all permissions in P . Ac-
cordingly, the answer to the Set Covering problem is “yes”.
Since the Set Covering problem is NP-complete, we conclude
that the complement of SSC(cid:104)⊗(cid:105) is NP-hard. Hence, SSC(cid:104)⊗(cid:105) is
coNP-hard.
