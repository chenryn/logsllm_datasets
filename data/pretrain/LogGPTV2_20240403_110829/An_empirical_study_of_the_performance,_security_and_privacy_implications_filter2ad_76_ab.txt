### Timestamp Accuracy and Network Traffic Monitoring

All campus traffic must traverse specific links, allowing us to observe all post-name-resolution events for any domain. This enables us to determine whether TCP connections are established for the resolved names. During two five-day periods within our monitoring timeframe, we also captured all incoming and outgoing network traffic from the campus during peak hours. Only packet headers were collected, and all client addresses were anonymized consistently with the DNS traces.

### Data Collection and Anonymization

Our collection servers were authorized for licensed use limited to Tsinghua University. The data was downloaded on March 18, 2021, at 14:43:14 UTC from IEEE Xplore, with applicable restrictions.

### Network Infrastructure

- **DNS Server Pool**: ns1, ns2, ns3
- **Traffic Collection Points**: All Traffic, DNS Traffic
- **Network Topology**: DAG Edge, Internet, Campus Network

### Summary Statistics (Summer and Fall 2010 Datasets)

| Metric                       | Summer       | Fall         |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Average Queries per Day      | 63.3M        | 42.4M        |
| Average Unique Clients per Day | 330,665     | 242,676      |
| Average Cache Miss Rate per Day | 57.1% ±5.1% | 20.8% ±4.5%  |
| Internal Clients             | 55.2% ±3.1%  | 22.0% ±4.3%  |
| All Clients                  | 73.2% ±5.6%  | 69.1% ±4.1%  |

### Query Patterns and Prefetching

To ensure that all queries for extracted domains arrive at the name server within a small timeframe, we identified common prefixes (e.g., img, ads, cdn) and excluded them from prefetching groups. We validated this by comparing DNS queries deemed necessary for rendering a page to actual HTTP/HTTPS connections in the campus trace. 96.7% of the required queries were mapped to subsequent web connections. These required queries were not counted in the prefetching overheads.

### Impact of Prefetching

**Figure 2: Identifying and Labeling Prefetching Events**

We extracted all HTTP/HTTPS connections during peak periods over 10 days and matched them with related DNS queries. Queries not matching any web connection were labeled as 'extraneous'. Analysis of query inter-arrival times showed that 95% of extraneous queries occurred within 1 second of a valid query. This observation was used to identify prefetching events.

### Legitimate vs. Extraneous Queries

Using our data generation framework, we rendered each webpage for Alexa's Top-1000 websites and studied DNS query patterns with prefetching turned off. Most pages induced queries for images, multimedia components, advertisements, and trackers, usually to a few select domains (e.g., akamai, doubleclick).

### Overhead on Name Servers

**Table I: Key Statistics of Our Datasets**

- **Traffic Increase in Fall**: Corresponds to increased campus population.
- **Cache Miss Rate**: Calculated based on upstream queries. Low cache miss rate for all clients is due to external client queries, while high cache-miss rate for internal browser clients suggests a power-law distribution for domain name accesses.

### Load Patterns

**Figures 3(a) and 3(b): Query Load in 1-Minute Intervals**

- **Summer**: Peak requests around 40,000 queries.
- **Fall**: Peak requests around 68,000 queries, influenced by returning students and Google's Instant Search launch.

### Typed-in Navigation and Prefetching

Modern browsers attempt to autocomplete user input, generating DNS queries. Some of these queries result in non-existent (NX) responses or valid but unintended domains. We analyzed prefetching events during typed-in navigation and found that they constitute a significant portion of browser-related queries.

### Caching Impact

**Figure 5: Domain Reuse Patterns and TTL Distribution**

- **TTL Values**: 67.2% of A records have TTL values < 5 minutes; 31.2% have TTLs < 20 seconds.
- **CNAME Records**: 37% have TTLs ≥ 1 hour; 7% last > 1 day.
- **Reuse Distribution**: 98% of domain names accessed < 10 times. Normalizing for TTLs, overall usage falls by about 40%, indicating that prefetched domains often expire before reuse.

### DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)

**Impact on DNSSEC Deployment**

- **DNSSEC Overview**: Extends DNS with public key cryptography for secure transactions.
- **Key Elements**: Resource Record Set (RRSet), DNSKEY, RRSIG, Delegation Signer (DS).
- **Simulator Analysis**: Designed and implemented a cache simulator to study the impact of prefetching on DNSSEC verification.
