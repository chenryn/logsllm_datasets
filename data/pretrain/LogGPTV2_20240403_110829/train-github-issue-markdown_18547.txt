## Feature request
**What is the expected behavior?**
The documentation says that
> The `[contenthash]` substitution will add a unique hash based on the content
> of an asset. When the asset's content changes, `[contenthash]` will change
> as well.
However, the `[contenthash]` does **not** actually match the hash of the file,
i.e. the result you would get if you ran `md5sum` or `sha256sum` on the file.
This StackOverflow answer explains why: the `[contenthash]` is computed before
minification.
The feature request is to compute the `[contenthash]` _after_ minification/any
other post-processing steps, or at least provide an option to do so.
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**
This would have nice properties, such as allowing proxies to validate the
integrity of a file just by comparing its hash to the filename.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**
Change the point in the process where the `[contenthash]` is computed. I don't
know anything about webpack's architecture so I have no idea how hard this is.
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**
I'm not a webpack developer but if there was some guidance from an expert I
could take a stab at it.
