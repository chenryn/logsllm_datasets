### Exploit Site Analysis and Ranking Algorithms

In this section, we will describe two ranking algorithms designed to prioritize the investigation of numerous URLs and sites. These algorithms are crucial for efficiently managing resources in anti-exploit efforts.

#### 1. Site Ranking Based on Connection Counts

**Figure 5** illustrates the top 15 exploit sites for SP1-UP, ranked by their connection counts. The height of each bar represents the number of direct traffic-redirection relationships a given site has with other sites. This metric is indicative of how deeply a site is embedded within the exploit community.

Each bar is divided into three segments:
- **Black Segment:** Represents the number of sites that redirect traffic to the given site.
- **White Segment:** Represents the number of sites to which the given site redirects traffic.
- **Gray Segment:** Indicates the number of sites that have a two-way traffic redirection relationship with the given site.

For example:
- **Site #15:** A content provider selling traffic to multiple exploit providers and sharing traffic with a few other content providers.
- **Site #7:** An exploit provider receiving traffic from multiple websites.
- **Sites #4, #5, and #9:** Pornography sites that redirect traffic to many exploit providers and receive traffic from many content providers. Their heavy involvement in exploit activities and shared ownership suggest they may be primarily set up for exploit purposes.

**Importance of Site Ranking:**
Site ranking, categorization, and grouping are essential in the anti-exploit process. They form the basis for deciding the most effective resource allocation for monitoring, investigation, blocking, and legal actions. For instance, high-ranked exploit sites should be closely monitored because a zero-day exploit page connected to any of them could affect a large number of websites. Legal investigations should focus on top exploit providers rather than content providers that merely redirect traffic and do not perform exploits themselves.

#### 2. Site Ranking Based on Number of Hosted Exploit-URLs

**Figure 6** illustrates the top 129 sites, each hosting more than one exploit URL. This ranking helps highlight those websites whose internal page hierarchy provides important insights.

**Key Observations:**
- **Well-Organized Hierarchical Structure:** Some websites host a large number of exploit pages with a well-organized hierarchical structure. For example, the #1 site hosts 24 exploit pages organized by what appear to be affiliate account names. Other sites organize their exploit pages by affiliate IDs or referring site names.
- **Sophisticated Web Sites:** Some sophisticated websites use transient URLs containing random strings, making investigations more difficult. Ranking based on the number of hosted exploit-URLs helps prioritize such sites for investigation.

### Zero-Day Exploit Detection

In early July 2005, a Stage-3 HoneyMonkey discovered our first zero-day exploit. The `javaprxy.dll` vulnerability was known at the time but lacked an available patch. The HoneyMonkey system detected the first exploit page within 2.5 hours of scanning, confirming it as the first in-the-wild exploit-URL of the vulnerability reported to the Microsoft Security Response Center. A second exploit-URL was detected in the next hour, occupying positions #132 and #179 in our list of 752 monitored URLs.

**Response and Follow-Up:**
- **Security Advisory and Bulletin:** The response center provided customers with a security advisory and a follow-up security bulletin.
- **Exploit Upgrades:** Over the next five days, HoneyMonkey detected that 26 of the 752 exploit-URLs upgraded to the zero-day exploit. Redirection analysis revealed that 25 of them were redirecting traffic to a previously unknown exploit provider site. Takedown notices were sent after further investigation, and most of the 25 web pages stopped exploiting the vulnerability shortly after.
- **Latest-Patched-Vulnerability Exploit Monitoring:** One day after the patch release, HoneyMonkey detected another increase in the number of exploit-URLs. Redirection analysis revealed that all of them were redirecting traffic to a previously known exploit provider (ranked #1 in Figure 6), who added a new exploit page for `javaprxy.dll`. A takedown notice was sent, and all 53 URLs stopped exploiting within a couple of days.

### Important Observations

This experience provides concrete evidence that the HoneyMonkey system can evolve into a full-fledged, systematic, and automatic zero-day exploit monitoring system for browser-based attacks. Key observations include:

1. **Monitoring Easy-to-Find Exploit-URLs:** Monitoring the 752 exploit-URLs proved effective for detecting zero-day exploits, as these URLs are more popular and easier to reach.
2. **Monitoring Content Providers with Well-Known URLs:** Monitoring content providers with well-known URLs is effective for tracking the dynamic behavior of exploit providers.
3. **Monitoring Highly Ranked and Advanced Exploit-URLs:** Top exploit sites are more likely to upgrade their exploits due to their serious investment in the business.

### Scanning Popular URLs

By specifically searching for potentially malicious websites, we obtained a list of URLs where 1.28% of the pages performed exploits. To address the concern of whether users need to worry about vulnerability exploits if they avoid risky websites, we gathered the most popular one million URLs as measured by click-through counts from a search engine and tested them with the HoneyMonkey system.

**Comparison of Suspicious List and Popular List Data:**

| Metric | Suspicious List | Popular List |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URLs Scanned | 16,190 | 1,000,000 |
| Exploit URLs | 207 (1.28%) | 710 (0.071%) |
| Exploit URLs After Redirection (Expansion Factor) | 752 (263%) | 1,036 (46%) |
| Exploit Sites | 288 | 470 |
| SP2-to-SP1 Ratio | 131/980 = 0.13 | 204/688 = 0.30 |

**Summary Statistics:**
- **Before Redirection Analysis:** Of the one million URLs, 710 were identified as exploit pages, translating to a density of 0.071%. Eleven of these exploit pages are among the top 10,000 URLs.
- **After Redirection Analysis:** The list of 710 exploit-URLs expanded to 1,036 URLs hosted by 470 sites, indicating a 46% expansion. The lower SP2-to-SP1 ratio (0.13) suggests that the exploit capabilities in the popular list are less advanced compared to the suspicious list.

**Intersection of Exploit Sites:**
- **Overlap:** Intersecting the 470 exploit sites with the 288 sites from the suspicious list yielded only 17 sites, suggesting a low degree of overlap. However, there is a potential for more exploit sites from the suspicious list to infiltrate the popular list to increase their infection base.

In total, we have collected 1,780 exploit-URLs hosted by 741 sites.
