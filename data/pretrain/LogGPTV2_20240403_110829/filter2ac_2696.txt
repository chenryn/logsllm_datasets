**Title: Mining and Exploiting (Mobile) Payment Credential Leaks in the Wild**

Over the past decade, an increasing number of mobile applications have integrated third-party payment services, often referred to as "Cashiers." These Cashiers allow end-users to perform transactions directly from their smartphones. To secure these services, Cashiers issue various payment credentials, such as PKCS#12 certificates, which are shared with mobile apps for authentication and authorization operations, including refunds.

Despite the critical nature of these payment credentials, existing research has primarily focused on specific credential leaks from known sources, such as Android APKs or GitHub repositories. There has been limited effort to study the broader prevalence of payment credential leaks and their security implications.

In this presentation, we begin by providing an overview of mobile payment services offered by four major Cashiers, which collectively serve over 1 billion users globally. We then identify potential sources of payment credential leaks, including some that have not been extensively investigated before. For example, we found that the backend servers of mobile apps can inadvertently expose payment credentials to the public.

Next, we discuss four types of exploits that can be enabled by these payment credential leaks, particularly when combined with other implementation flaws. These exploits can lead to serious consequences, ranging from direct financial losses for the mobile apps to privacy violations for end-users. Specifically, with the leaked payment credentials, an attacker could potentially steal money directly from the accounts of the mobile apps and access all user payment records.

To address this issue, we designed and implemented an automated tool to mine for leaked payment credentials from public version control systems (VCS) and APKs at a market scale. Our tool discovered approximately 20,000 leaked payment credentials, affecting thousands of apps and millions of end-users. We have responsibly disclosed these findings to the affected Cashiers, and some of the leaking apps have since revoked their compromised credentials.
