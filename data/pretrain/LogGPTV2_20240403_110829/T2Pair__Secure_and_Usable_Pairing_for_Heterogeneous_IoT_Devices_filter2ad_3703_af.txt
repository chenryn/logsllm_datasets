### Usability of T2Pair with Different Input Methods

Holding a large smartphone and twisting a small knob can be cumbersome. However, using a larger knob (e.g., a Nest Thermostat), a button, or a touchscreen is more practical. As wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers become increasingly popular, the usability of T2Pair can benefit from this trend.

### 10. Conclusion

IoT devices often lack traditional user interfaces and are diverse in nature. A secure pairing approach that is applicable to a wide range of IoT devices is urgently needed. We have presented T2Pair, a secure and versatile solution for pairing IoT devices. T2Pair can be applied to a variety of IoT devices without requiring any hardware modifications, sensor calibration, or clock synchronization. We designed simple physical operations that allow users to complete the pairing process in just a few seconds. 

We introduced the concept of faithful fuzzy commitment, which ensures that small distances between encodings accurately reflect small differences between the encoded values, leading to high pairing accuracy. Additionally, we proposed pauses and self-checking mechanisms to enhance the resilience of T2Pair against powerful attacks. A comprehensive evaluation, including a user study, demonstrated T2Pair's high security, usability, stability, and efficiency.

### A. Usability Study

This study investigates the usability of T2Pair and compares it with the password-based pairing mechanism, which is currently one of the most widely used methods.

#### A.1. Recruitment and Design

We recruited 20 participants (9 females) by posting recruitment flyers on the university campus. The study was advertised as "evaluating the usability of different pairing mechanisms for IoT devices." Most participants were not from the CS department and had no background in computer security. Specifically, 3 participants were local residents near the campus, 15 were students, and 2 were staff/faculty members, with ages ranging from 20 to 70.

To avoid social desirability bias, we did not inform the participants that T2Pair was a mechanism we were working on. Instead, we told them we were investigating the usability of different pairing methods. For the password-based mechanism, we used an 8-character alphanumeric password, as this is typically required for Wi-Fi passwords [17]. The experiment was conducted in a lab environment.

Each participant signed a consent form and filled out an initial survey to collect demographic information. We then introduced the two pairing mechanisms (T2Pair and the password-based mechanism) in a random order to avoid learning bias. For T2Pair, we explained the three pairing operations for the three types of IoT devices, while a smartphone was used for inputting the password. Each participant performed two pairing attempts on each of the three IoT devices and the smartphone to get familiar with T2Pair and the password-based mechanism. These attempts were excluded from further analysis. After that, each participant performed another three pairing attempts on each IoT device and the smartphone.

Finally, participants rated five statements to examine user preferences and usability (rating scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree):
(a) I thought the pairing method was easy to use.
(b) I am satisfied with the amount of time it took to complete the pairing.
(c) I thought the pairing method was convenient.
(d) I would imagine that most people would learn to perform the pairing very quickly.
(e) I would be happy to use this pairing method frequently.

The questions were inspired by previous studies [6, 22] and adapted based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) [9]. We did not use all 10 questions in SUS as some did not fit our scenario. At the end, we conducted brief interviews with the participants to gain insights into what they liked and disliked about each mechanism.

#### A.2. Usability Results

**Perceived Usability:** We evaluated usability based on the five aspects: ease of use, speed, convenience, quick learning, and frequent use. Figure 10 shows the results. The overall scores for button clicking, knob twisting, and screen swiping were (21.70 ± 3.29), (19.80 ± 3.76), and (21.65 ± 3.54), respectively. For password-based pairing, the overall score was (18.45 ± 3.37).

To analyze the statistical significance, we hypothesized that T2Pair has similar usability to the password-based method. Using a one-way ANOVA test, we found significant differences between button clicking and inputting an 8-character password (F(1, 19) = 9.057, p = 0.005 < 0.05) and between screen swiping and inputting a password (F(1, 19) = 8.149, p = 0.007 < 0.05). There was no significant difference between knob twisting and inputting a password (F(1, 19) = 1.358, p = 0.251). Therefore, we conclude that users perceive better usability with button clicking and screen swiping than with an 8-character password, and similar usability for knob twisting and using an 8-character password.

**Pairing Time:** We focused on the time used by the user, excluding the time for running the pairing protocol. For T2Pair, the mean time for performing a pairing on the button, knob, and screen was 5.2 ± 0.57s, 6.0 ± 0.83s, and 5.6 ± 0.73s, respectively. For the 8-character alphanumeric password, the mean time was 9.5 ± 0.78s. Thus, T2Pair is more efficient.

**Failure Rate:** Each participant performed three attempts on each device, resulting in 60 pairings per device. For T2Pair, there were 3 failures for the button, 2 for the knob, and 4 for the touchscreen. For the password-based mechanism, there were 5 failures out of 60 pairings. Thus, T2Pair has a slightly lower failure rate.

**Feedback:** Participants provided comments on the advantages and disadvantages of the three pairing operations. Seven subjects liked the button clicking operation for its minimal effort, while some mentioned that twisting the knob for too many rounds could lead to fatigue, though 7 twists were acceptable.

### B. Sensing Pairing Operations (Buttons and Screens)

We analyzed the correlation between IMU data and pairing operations (see Section 3.2). Figures 11 and 12 show the acceleration and gyroscope data captured during button pressing and screen swiping, respectively, and their correlation with the corresponding operations.
