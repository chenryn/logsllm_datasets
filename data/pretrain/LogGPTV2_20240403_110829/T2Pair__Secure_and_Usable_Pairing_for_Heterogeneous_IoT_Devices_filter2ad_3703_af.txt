It is not very usable to hold a large smartphone and twist a small
knob. But given a large knob (e.g., a Nest Thermostat), a button
or a touchscreen, it is not an issue. As wearable devices, such as
smartwatches and fitness trackers, become increasingly popular,
the usability of T2Pair can benefit from the trend.
10 CONCLUSION
IoT devices lack traditional user interfaces and are diverse in nature.
A secure pairing approach that is applicable to heterogeneous IoT
devices is urgently needed. We have presented T2Pair, which is
secure and applicable to a large variety of IoT devices. It can be
applied to IoT devices without requiring any hardware modifica-
tions, sensor calibration, or clock synchronization. We designed
very simple physical operations that allow users to finish a pairing
process conveniently in a few seconds. We proposed faithful fuzzy
commitment, which ensures small distances between encodings
faithfully indicate small differences between the encoded values,
leading to high pairing accuracy. Pauses and self-checking were
proposed to enhance the resilience of T2Pair to powerful attacks. A
comprehensive evaluation along with a user study was performed,
showing its high security, usability, stability, and efficiency.

A USABILITY STUDY
This study investigates the usability of T2Pair and compares it
with the password-based pairing mechanism as the baseline, which
is currently one of the most widely used pairing mechanisms.
A.1 Recruitment and Design
We recruit 20 participants (9 females) by posting the recruitment fly-
ers on the university campus. The study is advertised as “evaluating
Session 1E: Cyberphysical Systems CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA321Figure 10: Usability surveyed using questions adapted from SUS [9].
the usability of different pairing mechanisms for IoT devices”. Most
participants are not from the CS department and none of them have
computer security background. Specifically, 3 participants are local
residents near the campus, 15 are students, and 2 are staff/faculty
members. Their ages range from 20 to 70.
Considering the social desirability bias, we do not make the
participants aware that T2Pair is a mechanism that we are working
on. Instead, we inform them that we are investigating the usability
of different pairing methods. For the password-based mechanism,
as a Wi-Fi password usually requires a minimum of 8 alphanu-
meric characters [17], we randomly create a 8-char alphanumeric
password, and show the password to the participants before pairing.
The experiment is conducted in a lab environment. We first
ask each participant to sign a consent form and fill out an initial
survey to collect the demographic information. We then introduce
the two pairing mechanisms (i.e., T2Pair and the password-based
mechanism) to them in a random order to avoid the learning bias.
Specifically, for T2Pair, we introduce the three pairing operations
with respect to the three types of IoT devices, while a smartphone is
used for inputting a password. Next, each participant is instructed
to perform two pairing attempts on each of the three IoT devices
as well as the smartphone to get familiar with T2Pair and the
password-based mechanism. These attempts are excluded from
further analysis. After that, each one performs another three pairing
attempts on each IoT device and the smartphone, respectively.
Finally, the participants are asked to rate the following five state-
ments to examine user preferences and usability (the rating score is
from 1 to 5, where 1 stands for strongly disagree, and 5 for strongly
agree): (a) I thought the pairing method was easy to use; (b) I am
satisfied with the amount of time it took to complete the pairing; (c)
I thought the pairing method was convenient; (d) I would imagine
that most people would learn to perform the pairing very quickly;
and (e) I would be happy to use this pairing method frequently.
The questions are inspired from the metrics used in previous stud-
ies [6, 22] and adapted based on SUS [9]. We do not use all the 10
questions in SUS as some do not fit our scenario. At the end, we
conduct a brief interview with the participants to gain insights into
what they like and dislike about each mechanism.
A.2 Usability Results
Perceived usability. We investigate the usability from five aspects
based on the five statements above: easy to use, quick, convenient,
learn quickly, and use frequently. Figure 10 shows the results. The
overall scores for button clicking, knob twisting, and screen swiping
are (21.70± 3.29), (19.80± 3.76), and (21.65± 3.54), respectively. For
password-based pairing, the overall score is (18.45± 3.37).
To analyze the statistical significance of these results, we first
hypothesize that T2Pair shows similar usability as password. We
use the one-way ANOVA test to examine the hypothesize. The
result of the one-way ANOVA test shows that (i) there are signifi-
cant differences between button clicking and inputting an 8-char
password (𝐹(1, 19)= 9.057, 𝑝= 0.005< 0.05) and between screen
swiping and inputting password (𝐹(1, 19)= 8.149, 𝑝= 0.007< 0.05),
(𝐹(1, 19)= 1.358, 𝑝= 0.251). We thus conclude that users perceive
and thus our hypothesis can be rejected; and (ii) there is no sig-
nificant difference between knob twisting and inputting password
better usability with button clicking and screen swiping than using
an 8-char password, and similar usability for knob twisting and
using an 8-char password.
Pairing time. We do not consider the time used for running the
pairing protocol as we only focus on the time used by the user. For
T2Pair, the mean time for performing a pairing on the button, knob,
and screen is 5.2±0.57s, 6.0±0.83s, and 5.6±0.73s, respectively. With
8-char alphanumeric password is 9.5± 0.78s. Thus, our mechanism
respect to password, the mean time for reading and inputting an
is more efficient.
Failure rate. For T2Pair (based on the thresholds selected in Sec-
tion 7.1), each participant performs three attempts on each device—
there are 60 pairings for each device. We see 3 failures out of 60
attempts for button, 2 failures for knob, and 4 failures for touch-
screen. Then, each one reads and inputs a given password three
times on the smartphone—there are 60 pairings and 5 failures. Thus,
T2Pair has a slightly lower failure rate than the password-based
mechanism.
Feedback. We also collect their comments about the advantages
and disadvantages of our three pairing operations from different
perspectives. We here report some representative comments: com-
ments from seven subjects indicate that they like the button clicking
pairing operations as they require little effort and/or burden; some
also mention that twisting the knob for too many rounds can lead
to fatigue, but 7 twistings used by T2Pair are acceptable.
