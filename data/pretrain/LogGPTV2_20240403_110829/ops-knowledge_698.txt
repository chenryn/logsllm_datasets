Assistant: This system log chunk is tracking two separate attempts to break into the system. The first attempt was from 173.234.31.186 at 06:55:46, and the second attempt was from 52.80.34.196 at 07:07:38. Both attempts used an invalid user name, "webmaster" and "test9" respectively, and both attempts failed.
