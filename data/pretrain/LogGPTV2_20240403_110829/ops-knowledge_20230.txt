User: I have two versions of my app, prod and dev that I manage from one git repo.  The way I've been managing them is to constantly switch and uncomment lines in both my app.yaml and my cron.yaml depending upon which version I want to upload.  
I was wondering if anyone had better experience managing two different versions within one git repo.
Assistant: I've been using two branches where the app.yaml files are different.  But it requires that I have to be careful when merging and explicitly NOT merge the app.yaml file.  It's still a pain.
