## Abstract
In 2015, a security incident involving a Jeep Cherokee highlighted the vulnerability of in-vehicle networks to remote control via spoofed messages. This incident underscored the critical need for robust security measures in autonomous and connected vehicles. To address this, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can detect spoofing messages at the central gateway. We also evaluate the performance of this system using real in-vehicle network data.

## 1. Introduction
Modern vehicles are equipped with 70 to 100 electronic control units (ECUs) connected via in-vehicle networks. These ECUs enhance safety and convenience by sharing control data with external services. However, this connectivity also introduces the risk of cyberattacks, where unauthorized remote control can be achieved by abusing these communication channels. Detecting such attacks is essential for maintaining vehicle security. An IDS is a key tool for this purpose, especially given the long product life of vehicles, which makes them susceptible to unknown cyberattacks. Anomaly-based IDSs, which detect deviations from normal behavior, are effective but have limitations in identifying spoofing messages. This paper proposes an anomaly-based IDS with enhanced capabilities for detecting spoofing messages, and evaluates its performance using CAN protocol traffic data.

## 2. CAN Protocol and Security Threats

### 2.1 Features of CAN
The CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol and its variant, CAN FD (Flexible Data Rate), are widely used in in-vehicle networks. CAN was standardized by ISO 11898-1 (2003), while CAN FD was introduced in ISO 11898-1 (2015). Both protocols use a bus topology, allowing one node to broadcast messages to multiple nodes. CAN frames can carry up to 8 bytes, while CAN FD frames can carry up to 64 bytes.

### 2.2 Communication Characteristics
CAN messages are sent in two patterns: cyclic and non-cyclic. Cyclic messages, such as those for vehicle speed and engine status, are sent at regular intervals. Non-cyclic messages, like door lock events, are sent as needed.

### 2.3 Network Configuration
In-vehicle networks often use a bus topology with gateways to connect multiple sub-networks. A central gateway, as shown in Figure 1, can reduce communication delays by connecting sub-networks directly.

### 2.4 Security Threats
Koscher et al. identified three main vulnerabilities in the CAN protocol:
1. Control information on the network can be easily analyzed.
2. Spoofing messages can be easily inserted.
3. The CAN protocol is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

These threats can be exploited by an attacker ECU, as illustrated in Figure 2.

## 3. In-Vehicle Network Security Measures

### 3.1 Conventional Technology
Security measures for in-vehicle networks can be categorized into secure communications and IDSs. Vehicles with long product lives require IDSs to ensure continued security even against unknown cyberattacks.

### 3.2 IDS
There are two types of IDSs: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based systems detect known attack patterns, while anomaly-based systems detect deviations from normal behavior. Anomaly-based systems are better suited for detecting unknown cyberattacks.

## 4. In-Vehicle IDS

### 4.1 Newly Developed System
Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. has developed an anomaly-based IDS with three monitoring levels: buses, messages, and payloads. Higher monitoring levels facilitate the identification of attacked subjects, but require more resources.

### 4.2 Shortcomings of Conventional In-Vehicle IDSs
Conventional IDSs struggle to detect spoofing messages. Systems that monitor message characteristics or sensor-based control data may fail to distinguish spoofing messages from normal ones, especially if the data is slightly and repeatedly tampered with.

## 5. Proposed System

### 5.1 CDEC
To address the limitations of conventional IDSs, we propose CDEC (Control Data Estimation for Anomaly Detection with Correlation Data). CDEC monitors sensor-based control data in the message payload using correlated control data groups. This approach improves the detection of spoofing messages, especially when implemented at the central gateway.

### 5.2 Application Model
The proposed system consists of three functions: divider, estimator, and evaluator. The divider memorizes correlated control data, the estimator calculates estimates based on the vehicle data model, and the evaluator compares the estimated and actual values to detect anomalies.

### 5.3 Vehicle Data Model
The vehicle data model is used to estimate monitored control data based on correlated control data. The learning process involves two stages: correlation analysis and parameter determination. A regression model is used for the vehicle data model, as detailed in references [8] and [9].

## 6. Evaluation

### 6.1 Learning for Vehicle Data Model and Estimation Accuracy
We evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of the vehicle data model using eight types of sensor-based control data. The root mean square (RMS) of the estimated difference was used as an evaluation index. The results, shown in Figure 5, indicate that the vehicle data model can be learned using in-vehicle network traffic data, with high estimation accuracy for most control data types.

## Conclusion
This paper presents an anomaly-based IDS for in-vehicle networks that uses sensor correlation and integration to detect spoofing messages. The proposed system, CDEC, shows improved detection performance, especially when implemented at the central gateway. Future work will focus on further refining the system and expanding its application to other in-vehicle network configurations.
