### Directory Structure and Webpack Configuration

#### Overview
My project has a `pages` folder inside the `src` root, and a `static` folder at the same level as the `src` folder. I need to configure Webpack so that I can access files inside the `static` folder from `src/pages/index.js`.

#### Current Behavior
Currently, I am unable to access the files in the `static` folder from `src/pages/index.js`.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a `src` folder.
2. Move the `pages` folder into the `src` folder.
3. Try to access `static/xyz.png` from `src/pages/index.js`.

#### Context
I am restructuring my project to move all dynamic code into the `src` folder. I want to ensure that I can still access static assets from within this new structure.

#### Environment
- Next.js: [Version]
- Node.js: [Version]
- Operating System: [OS Version]
- Browser: [Browser Version]
- etc: [Other relevant versions]

#### Request for Assistance
I have searched the issues in this repository and believe this is not a duplicate. Can someone please provide guidance on how to configure Webpack to achieve this?

### Suggested Webpack Configuration

To configure Webpack to allow access to the `static` folder from `src/pages/index.js`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Update Webpack Configuration:**
   Modify your Webpack configuration to include the `static` folder as an alias or a module path.

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   module.exports = {
     // Other Webpack configurations...
     resolve: {
       alias: {
         '@static': path.resolve(__dirname, 'static')
       }
     },
     module: {
       rules: [
         // Other rules...
         {
           test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|svg)$/i,
           use: [
             {
               loader: 'file-loader',
               options: {
                 name: '[name].[ext]',
                 outputPath: 'static/',
                 publicPath: '/static/'
               }
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Access Static Files in `index.js`:**
   Use the alias to import the static files in your `src/pages/index.js`.

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import xyzImage from '@static/xyz.png';

   const IndexPage = () => (
     <div>
       <img src={xyzImage} alt="XYZ" />
     </div>
   );

   export default IndexPage;
   ```

This configuration will allow you to access the `static` folder from within the `src` directory and use the images or other static assets in your components.
