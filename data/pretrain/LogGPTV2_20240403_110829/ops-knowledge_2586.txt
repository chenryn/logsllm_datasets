**User:** I have installed Python and added its path, "C:\Python27", to the system environment variables. However, when I type "python" in PowerShell, I encounter an error (as mentioned in the title). Additionally, I am unable to run it from the Command Prompt. My Python folder is located in the C: directory.

**Assistant:** To run a Python script from the command line, you need to use the full path to the Python executable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to your Python installation directory:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Python27
   ```
3. Run your Python script using the full path to the Python executable:
   ```powershell
   .\python.exe .\PRACTICE.py
   ```

If you want to be able to run Python by simply typing `python` in PowerShell or Command Prompt, ensure that the `C:\Python27` directory is correctly added to your system's PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Open Environment Variables:**
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" on the desktop or in File Explorer.
   - Select "Properties".
   - Click on "Advanced system settings".
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

2. **Edit the PATH Variable:**
   - In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and select it.
   - Click "Edit".
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New" and add the path to your Python installation, e.g., `C:\Python27`.
   - Click "OK" to close all windows.

3. **Verify the Change:**
   - Open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window.
   - Type `python --version` to check if Python is now recognized.

By following these steps, you should be able to run Python scripts by simply typing `python` followed by the script name.
