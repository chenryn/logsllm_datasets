User: I've installed python, and added it's path to system variables "C:\Python27" but when typing "python" to powershell, I get error mentioned in title. I also can't run it from cmd.
And yes, my python folder is in c directory.
Assistant: Type .\python.exe .\

PS C:\Python27> .\python.exe .\PRACTICE.py
Typing only python will not get recognized by windows.
