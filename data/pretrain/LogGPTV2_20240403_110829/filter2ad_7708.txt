Fingerprinting 
Recognize or Identify a Device 
 Extraction of characteristic attributes (features) of a system 
 What attributes are characteristic? 
 Combination of features as vector  Fingerprint 
 Which features are most discriminant? 
 Recognize or identify a device 
 Fraud detection / prevention  
 User tracking

 But often not only device but also user gets fingerprinted

 Existing methods not suitable for mobile devices 
 Techniques will evolve 
 Will there be a fingerprinting system for mobiles? 
 Are we able to evade this system?

Recognition Experiments 
Requirements to a Fingerprinting System 
a) Recognize a revisiting device by its fingerprint 
(match) 
b) Distinguish a never-seen device from all known devices 
(reject)

Recognition Experiments 
Testing the Robustness 
 Determine precision of recognition of mobile devices 
 Progressively remove most discriminant features from feature set 
 Repeat recognition test with smaller feature set

Recognition Experiments 
Scenarios 
1. All features 
2. No cookies 
3. No cookies, no localstorage and no host information 
4. No cookies, no localstorage, no host information and no IP address

Recognition Experiments 
 Single Iteration 
 All devices (and their features) are available immediately 
 Multi Iteration 
 Devices are available one after the other (in random order) 
 Simulate an evolving system

Single Iteration 
a) Recognition performs well 
b) Even without top features

Evasion 
 Tracking mobile devices is feasible and realistic 
 Cookies are obsolete 
 Device attributes sufficient for recognition 
 Can users evade fingerprint-based tracking?

Changeability of Features 
 Some attributes may be changed easily by a user

 Some features cannot be influenced easily

Evasion 
Scenarios 
 An evader has to know 
a) Which attributes are inquired for fingerprinting 
b) When these attributes are inquired 
 Scenarios 
i. Use a second browser alternately 
ii. Use a second browser with different settings 
iii. Use a proxy connection 
iv. Combination: Two browsers and proxy

Observations 
a) Browser change useless 
b) Proxy connection useless 
c) Change Settings effective 
d) Combination is best

Evasion 
Feasibility 
 Strong preconditions 
 Knowledge about the fingerprinting system is needed 
 Simple countermeasures fail 
 Using another browser or a proxy 
 Successfull evasion requires a high effort 
 Using browsers with different settings and a proxy 
 Evasion is possible, but neither pleasant nor easy 
20

Evasion 
Randomness 
 Emerging approach: Adding randomness to features 
 The fingerprint will be more random 
 Drawbacks: 
 Cannot change all device‘s attributes 
 Attributes are also used by legitimate functions 
 How to differentiate between „good“ and „bad“ functions? 
 Legitimate use cases for fingerprinting exist

Conclusion 
 Tracking libraries do not target mobile devices, yet 
 But tracking techniques will evolve 
 Mobile Web users are not safe from fingerprinting and tracking 
 Mobile devices provide sufficient characteristics 
 Evading fingerprinting is hard to achieve 
 Specific knowledge about the fingerprinting system is required 
 Not all attributes are in the user‘s sphere of influence 
 Randomizer, blocker and obfuscators need to discern fingerprinters
