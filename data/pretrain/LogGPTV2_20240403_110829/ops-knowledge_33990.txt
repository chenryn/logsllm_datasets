User: New to programming and python altogether. In the book I'm learning from, the author suggested I find out the purpose of Pydoc.
I did a google search on it, and found a match (from Gnome Terminal) but it didn't make much sense to me. Anyone mind simplifying a bit?
Assistant: Concise description provided by to Wikipedia:
"Pydoc allows Python programmers to access Python's documentation help files, generate text and HTML pages with documentation specifics, and find the appropriate module for a particular job."
