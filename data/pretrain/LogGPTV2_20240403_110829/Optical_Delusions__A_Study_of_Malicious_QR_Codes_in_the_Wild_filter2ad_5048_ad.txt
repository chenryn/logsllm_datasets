### QR Code-Based Phishing and Malware Attacks

#### Introduction
Attackers have exploited Facebook profile pictures by posting status updates that encourage users to scan a QR code and like a Facebook page, promising notifications on special savings offers. This strategy allows attackers to interact directly with a large number of potential victims by distributing their posts in popular discussion groups.

#### Experimental Findings
Based on our experiments, PayPal was identified as the most frequently targeted brand in payment-related phishing attacks. We discovered 11 QR codes that directed users to fake websites for online purchases, such as a fraudulent PayPal site. Once a victim scans the malicious QR code, they are redirected to a fake checkout page that requires their credentials to proceed. Additionally, we found three QR codes that directed users to counterfeit versions of other financial services, such as Cielo, the largest Brazilian credit and debit card operator. Although some posts in popular discussion groups indicate that the security community has raised concerns about QR code-based payment systems, no previous reports have documented the actual identification of such malicious QR codes in the wild.

#### Geographic and Domain Analysis
Table VI provides an overview of the most frequent domains used in QR code attacks and the associated IP addresses' countries. While the countries are widely distributed, the number of malicious QR codes linked to US IP addresses is significantly higher than others. Our analysis also shows that generic top-level domains (e.g., .com, .net, .org) are the most abused, accounting for 61% of URLs extracted from malicious QR codes. Country-specific top-level domains, such as .ru and .br, are also notably used. We did not observe significant use of URL shortening services, finding only five malicious QR codes that abused tinyurl.com to conceal the malicious links.

#### Proposed Defenses
The primary advantage for attackers using QR codes is the difficulty for users to visually distinguish between benign and malicious URLs. Therefore, a crucial first step in preventing QR code-based attacks is to ensure that users can inspect the decoded URL before their browser navigates to it.

Many popular QR code-capable mobile applications already follow this practice. For example, the ZXing Barcode Scanner displays a visual overlay after scanning a QR code, showing the barcode, the extracted data (including any URL), and metadata such as the code type and timestamp. This information can help attentive users determine if the data presents a threat.

However, research and experience show that users often struggle to differentiate between legitimate and malicious URLs. Attackers employ various techniques, such as domain prefixing and IDN homograph attacks, to disguise malicious URLs. To counter this, integrating automated checks for malicious URLs into browsers, similar to Google Safe Browsing, would be beneficial. We advocate for the integration of domain or URL blacklists into mobile applications that decode QR codes, providing immediate feedback to users about the safety of the decoded URL.

Another solution could be to integrate blacklist checks into mobile browsers or other applications that load content from potentially untrusted URLs. However, many mobile browsers, including Google Chrome for Android, do not currently incorporate these checks.

#### Conclusion
Our large-scale experiment analyzed over 14.7 million unique web pages and found that while QR codes are being used for malicious purposes, the frequency is relatively low. Only 145 out of 94,770 extracted QR codes showed evidence of malicious intent. The most prevalent form of QR code-based phishing attack involved spoofing password-protected social sharing sites like Facebook. Additionally, 11 malicious QR codes directed users to a fake version of the Google Play app market, and 94 were used to direct users to exploit or intermediate sites, or to distribute malware via direct download links.

Although the number of malicious QR codes is small, defenses against such codes should be clearly defined. Enabling browsers to automatically resolve QR codes and perform URL reputation checks before visiting the URLs could help prevent QR code-based attacks on mobile devices.

#### Related Work
Attacks on mobile devices have been extensively studied, focusing on mobile-specific malware and approaches for detecting or preventing security and privacy violations. Previous work has investigated user susceptibility to malicious QR codes and the current state of QR code scanners in terms of detecting malicious URLs. However, to our knowledge, prior research has not measured the extent of the threat posed by malicious QR codes on the public web as a vector for attacks against mobile device users.

Malicious QR codes share characteristics with other web security issues where attackers disguise malicious links as benign ones. The closest related class of attack is the distribution of malicious links using URL shortening services. However, QR codes pose a different problem because they are decoded on the mobile device itself, unlike URL shorteners, which can screen URLs for malicious behavior. Integrating existing URL blacklisting services into QR code applications could help mitigate the threat.

In general, mobile devices lag behind traditional desktop UIs in helping users avoid attacks. Studies have shown that robust UI mechanisms for informing users of potential security and privacy violations are lacking on both traditional and mobile platforms. Malicious QR codes represent another facet of the challenge of providing accurate and understandable security indicators to users.
