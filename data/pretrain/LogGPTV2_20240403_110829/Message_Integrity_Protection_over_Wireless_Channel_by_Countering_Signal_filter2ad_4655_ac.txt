4.2 Optimal Attack Strategy
Because the LoS and NLoS signal components are inde-
pendent of each other, the attacker can cancel the two
components separately.
4.2.1 LoS Component Strategy
As the LoS channel component h(cid:48) is assumed to be precisely
known, we have g(cid:48) = h(cid:48). Therefore we can easily derive the
optimal attack strategy for the LoS component:
Proposition 4.1. The optimal LoS component cancellation strat-
egy is:
(3)
The above indicates that the attacker will reverse the LoS
signal’s phase to completely cancel it out at the receiver side.
a(cid:48) = −1
4.2.2 NLoS Component Strategy
Given that the LoS component can be completely canceled,
we analyze the optimal attack strategy for NLoS part. We
start from deriving the distribution of received power of
this component under signal cancellation attack.
Type I attacker. For the type I attacker, the estimated
channel g(cid:48)(cid:48) is independent from h(cid:48)(cid:48). Since the source signal
x is randomly distributed, the power detected by receiver
is Py = σ2
v, where σx, σn, σv
are the variance (power) of the source signal and noises, re-
spectively. We can see that the variable |h(cid:48)(cid:48)|2 follows gamma
distribution Γ(1, 2σ2) as |h(cid:48)(cid:48)| is Rayleigh distributed, where
σ2 = 1

From the detection probability, we derive the optimal
NLoS attack strategy:

is:

Due to space limitations, the proof is omitted. As shown
in Theorem 4.2, the best strategy for type I attacker is to not

cancel the NLoS part. This is because, the estimated channel
g(cid:48)(cid:48) is not correlated with the real channel h(cid:48)(cid:48). Thus any non-
zero signal will only add more energy at the receiver B,
which increases the detection probability instead.

Type II and III attacker. According to the type II and
III attacker model, the main difference between them is
how they are implemented in practice. Thus we can use the
same theory to analyze them. In the power expression Py =
v, the component |h(cid:48)(cid:48)+a(cid:48)(cid:48)g(cid:48)(cid:48)|2 follows

According to equation 6, the detection probability is re-
lated to the estimated channel g(cid:48)(cid:48). Thus we will ﬁrst analyze
the effect of the parameter σ2 on the detection probability.
Theorem 4.4. The detection probability Pd(σ2) is a non-
decreasing function with respect to σ2.
The proof is in Supplementary Material. According to
Theorem 4.3, the minimum detection probability is achieved
when σ2 is inﬁnitely close to 0:

Pd(σ2) = 0

The above result shows, the perfect attack precisely es-
timates channel h(cid:48)(cid:48) such that the attacker’s signal is exactly
the opposite of the received signal from A to B, thus the
original signal will be completely attenuated. However, this
is an extreme case in which perfect CSI is assumed known
by the attacker. Some previous works are based on this
extreme case [14], [24], under which the link from A to B
has zero capacity. In this paper we consider a more realistic
general case in which the real CSI h(cid:48)(cid:48) and the attacker’s
estimated CSI g(cid:48)(cid:48) is correlated with arbitrary rh(cid:48)(cid:48)g(cid:48)(cid:48).
Theorem 4.5. The NLoS part’s optimal signal cancellation attack
strategy is:

The proof is in Supplementary Material. Given the op-

From the analysis above, we can see that the minimum
detection probability decreases with the increase of at-
tacker’s correlation coefﬁcient |rh(cid:48)(cid:48)g(cid:48)(cid:48)|. Also, previous works
that either assumed a 0 or 1 correlation coefﬁcient are two
extreme cases of our result.

4.3 Optimal Defender Strategy
Next, we analyze the legitimate pair’s optimal strategy.
From the above, the type I attacker is only a special case
of type II and III attacker when rh(cid:48)(cid:48)g(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0. In our model,
the signal x is independent of h(cid:48)(cid:48). The only transmitter pa-
rameter that has inﬂuence on the ﬁnal detection probability
is the power σ2
x. From Eq. (9), we can easily see that the
detection probability increases when σ2
x increases. In reality,
the transmitter’s power is limited, thus it indicates that the
transmitter should always choose its largest power level to
defend against signal cancellation attacks.
4.4 Simulation Results
To show the correctness of our proposed optimal attack
strategy, we used Matlab to simulate above theoretical
analysis in our previous work [1]. We mainly studied the
received signal power in the presence of signal cancella-
tion attack. More speciﬁcally, in the NLoS Rayleigh fading
channels, we generated two CSI sequences with a given
correlation coefﬁcient rh¯g to simulate the legitimate channel
and attacker’s estimation. The transmitting power was 0dB
and the channel gain was normalized to 1. The signal was
modulated using QPSK and the SNR at the receiver side
was set to be 25dB. The attacker was assumed to know rh¯g
and σ2
g so as to calculate the optimal attack strategy a. The
simulation results we got are: (1) The power of received
signal achieves the minimum when the attacker applies
the proposed optimal attack strategy, which conﬁrms the
correctness of our theoretical analysis. (2) There are three
factors that could lead to a higher detection probability in
optimal cancellation attack: a lower correlation coefﬁcient, a
higher detection threshold and a higher transmitting power.
5 CHANNEL RANDOMIZATION APPROACH
In this section, we show the crucial criteria in designing
channel randomization approach. Our basic idea is to ran-
domly switch among different radiation modes of a recon-
ﬁgurable antenna (RA) to change the legitimate CSI.
5.1 Characteristics of Reconﬁgurable Antenna
An RA is an antenna capable of dynamically rearranging
its antenna currents or radiating edges in a controlled and
reversible manner [28]. For a p-i-n diode based RA, by
changing its structure electronically, it can swiftly recon-
ﬁgure itself in terms of radiation pattern, polarization and
frequency, or combinations of them. In terms of randomiz-
ing CSI, we need to prevent the attacker from predicting
future CSI from historical CSI sequences (for type II attack),
as well as reduce the spatial correlation of CSI (for type
III attack). Thus, ideally an RA is expected to have the
following two properties for security: 1) the RA should have
a large and diverse set of antenna patterns, which have
different gains among different spatial directions (resulting
in small spatial correlation); 2) for a given spatial direction,
the antenna gains across different antenna modes should
have high variations (yielding small temporal correlation).

5.2 Antenna Mode Switching Period
For the directional antenna model [29], the CSI is repre-
(cid:48)
l), where Ll is the
path gain of the lth path and f (.) is the antenna-speciﬁc
characterization function which models the transmitter and
receiver gain of the direction from which the signal is trans-
mitted and received. Since the antenna gain of RA is differ-
ent for a given direction under different antenna modes, we
can randomize the wireless channel via randomly switching
the modes of RA. Besides, according to a recent study in
MIMO [17], the motion of beam steering can change both
the LoS and NLoS components of wireless channel, which
also indicates that using RA can create high CSI variations.
Except for increasing the randomness of CSI, to achieve
message integrity protection, it is also important to prevent
the attacker from predicting future CSI. Consider the sce-
nario that CSI is changing too slowly (that is, one antenna
mode lasts for several symbol periods), once obtaining one
exact CSI, the attacker is able to cancel out the following
symbols that use the same antenna mode. In practice, the
attacker is assumed to take at least one symbol period to
estimate CSI [30]. To prevent the attacker from accurately
predicting future CSI through historical CSI values, the
antenna mode of RA should change at least once in a symbol
period. As it is not necessary to change antenna mode too
frequently, we let the switching period of antenna mode
equal to OFDM symbol duration time in our design.
5.3 Antenna Mode Subset Selection
From Eq. (9), we can see that the correlation and the
variance of CSI are two factors that inﬂuence the detec-
tion probability under attack. The variance of CSI, which
ultimately creates a big difference in the RSS is mainly
caused by diversity in the antenna gains of different an-
tenna modes. Although there are many states available for
RA, the antenna gains of some modes can be very small,
which can result in low detection probability even before
cancellation affecting the decoding performance. Intuitively,
there is a tradeoff between security and performance: with
the increase of the number of candidate antenna modes, the
randomness and variance of CSI will increase due to higher
variety of antenna radiation patterns, however, the detection
probability without cancellation will decrease since there are
more antenna modes with small gains. Thus, we need to ﬁnd
a subset of antenna modes to optimize the balance between
security and performance goals. The optimal antenna mode
subset selection problem can be formulated as follows:
max Pd = e

s.t. Pd0 ≥ Ps
dk ∈ {0, 1}, ∀k ∈ K,
(10)
where Eq. (10) means that without signal cancellation attack
the detection probability Pd0 should be greater than a min-
imum threshold Ps, and dk = 1 indicates that the antenna
mode k is in the current subset K. As shown in Eq. (12)
h and |rh(cid:48)(cid:48)g(cid:48)(cid:48)|2 are non-linear functions of the
and (13), σ2
CSI sequence h. Besides, [31] shows that Pd0 is also a non-
linear function of h. Speciﬁcally, assume that the CSI under
