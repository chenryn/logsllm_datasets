As noted by the UA, governance in Baton Rouge must “continue moving from traditional stovepipe operational 
mentalities towards a regional, collaborative mindset supporting the need for and implementation of interoperability.”  
An Interoperability Committee exists within the Urban Area Security Initiative structure, but the membership is 
primarily emergency management agencies.  The UA indicates that it is trying to involve additional first responder 
disciplines and notes the need for more state and federal participation as a current challenge.  Agreements among 
agencies are largely informal, and no strategic plan has been developed to coordinate planning efforts in the UA.  
Although leaders in the UA are supportive of the communications interoperability issue, it does not appear that a long-
term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) fiscal strategy to improve regional interoperability (in addition to federal grants) has been 
developed.       
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure representation from first responder agencies across the UA in the governance group and clarify roles, 
responsibilities, and relationships 
• 
Establish the Region II Interoperability Committee through a formal charter, include all local, public support, state, 
and federal agencies (e.g., public health, utilities), and document roles and responsibilities as part of the group 
• 
Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memoranda of understanding [MOU] with defined 
roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies relating to regional interoperability 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP) and store them in an accessible format 
• 
Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications funding 
strategy (in addition to grants) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding that is consistent 
with the strategic plan 
• 
Begin to broaden and champion a governance structure that will support regional communications interoperability 
and involve senior regional government leadership in long-term funding plans

The Baton Rouge TICP provided the first regional interoperability SOPs for the UA.  Although strong representation 
from throughout the UA was included in the development of the TICP, the documentation did not indicate the extent to 
which these policies have been accepted in the UA.  Based on the TICP validation exercise evaluation, more work is 
needed to promulgate and practice these procedures; SOPs have not been officially disseminated to all area 
organizations.  Baton Rouge officials are addressing this need as indicated by a remote training program under 
development through the Emergency Operations Center network, which could support SOPs training.  Full acceptance 
and ongoing training of SOPs will be critical in addressing gaps that were encountered during the validation exercise

(e.g., failure to broadcast Communications Unit Leader [COML] designation).  Likewise, the exercise evaluation 
indicated that some issues were encountered with the use of the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident 
Command System (ICS) (e.g., Unified Command and COML responsibilities not announced).  The TICP notes that 
NIMS is not required (only recommended) of agencies in the UA, which is not in line with guidance provided for all 
grantees.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Develop regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) with acceptance by first responder 
agencies across jurisdictions and disciplines 
• 
Distribute and put SOPs into practice through regular training, exercises, and usage (e.g., communications 
interoperability among the eight parishes) 
• 
Consider scheduling a regular review and update process of developed policies and procedures  
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation 
consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS 
compliance

Officials in Baton Rouge indicated that they were using their numerous shared radio systems (e.g., six 800 megahertz 
[MHz] systems, two ultra high frequency [UHF] systems, one very high frequency [VHF] system) and shared channels 
on a daily basis for multi-agency communications.  Gateways are regularly used to connect these disparate systems in 
the UA, but there were observed difficulties in operating on the infrastructure in the TICP validation exercise (e.g., use 
of 10 codes).  Upon failed attempts to leverage interoperability solutions detailed in the TICP, many exercise 
participants resorted to commercial cellular technology rather than continuing efforts to reconcile technical difficulties.  
Evaluators noted, “Cell phones were used at all levels of command for critical communications across jurisdictions 
throughout the exercise.”  The apparent Baton Rouge public safety reliance on cellular technology would prove 
especially ineffective in response to an incident wherein commercial infrastructure were damaged or during a period of 
high commercial communications traffic (e.g., hurricane preparation and response). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for regional communications interoperability resources 
(e.g., deactivation of gateways, use of talk groups) to improve proficiency 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day 
activities

its public safety system with the State of Louisiana’s new 800 MHz P25 radio system; the UA is assessing how to best 
integrate the radio systems once the state has implemented its new system.  Currently, the UA is planning to purchase 
subscriber units for many local agencies, assess P25 backward compatibility features for some local communities to 
interoperate, and apply National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee frequencies for mutual aid.

Louisiana Urban Area (UA) Region 1 includes the City of New Orleans, Orleans Parish, and mutual aid 
partners Jefferson, St Bernard, and Plaquemines parishes. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
As a result of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans has encountered an unheralded level of involvement from all 
levels of government in the oversight of the communications interoperability issue.  Governance in the area 
is provided through the New Orleans Regional Communications Group, which provides recommendations to 
the Louisiana Region 1 Board of Directors.  The group is inclusive of both state and federal representatives.  
Formal agreements are in place for use of the New Orleans Maritime Interoperable Committee [NOMIC] 
system, and additional agreements have been adopted by included agencies since Hurricane Katrina.  
Agreements have been reinforced by the adoption of a regional strategic plan, which is accepted by all 
included agencies. While fiscal priorities have been clearly articulated in the development of a regional 
shared system, a long-term funding strategy should be developed that looks beyond federal grants for the 
inevitable lifecycle costs of a new system.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Define governance structure in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) to document the 
roles, responsibilities, and relationships of the governance groups (e.g., New Orleans Regional 
Communications Group) 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding, intergovernmental agreements) 
in the TICP and store them in an accessible format 
• 
Develop a funding strategy for identifying sustainable funding sources (in addition to grants) to cover 
lifecycle and recurring costs to operate the area’s interoperability assets

The New Orleans TICP is based on various existing policies and procedures (e.g., NOMIC gateways 
procedures), as well as lessons learned from reviews of SOPs after Hurricane Katrina.  The UA has taken a 
number of steps to disseminate and begin training on the SOPs (e.g., distributed to all participating agencies 
and dispatch centers, distributed through TICP Workshop) among the participating organizations.  Ongoing 
training and regular review of SOPs will be critical in addressing some gaps that were encountered during the 
validation exercise (e.g., gateway policies were not followed).  The exercise evaluation indicated that some 
issues were encountered with the use of National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command 
System (ICS), including lack of access to Unified Command and a failure to update the pre-developed ICS 
205 form.  NIMS/ICS has been a focus of training more than the last year, and it is now mandated through 
city ordinance and executive order in all four parishes, which is commendable.

New Orleans has indicated that regular testing and exercise is a critical priority to ensure familiarity with the 
use of new technology that is currently being implemented.  This was demonstrated by the TICP validation 
exercise, which was held immediately after the partial activation of the City of New Orleans’ newly acquired 
700/800 megahertz (MHz) system.  The exercise exposed some gaps, not only with use of the new system 
(the evaluators noted that some participants had only one hour training on this system), but also with use of 
the NOMIC fixed gateway system.  As noted by the evaluators, the “NOMIC problem was caused by a lack 
of operational familiarity with gateway operation.”  The UA eventually incorporated both state and federal 
agencies in the validation exercise through the use of the National Public Safety Planning Advisory 
Committee (NPSPAC) channels and the NOMIC system.  But, as noted by evaluators, “[T]he region should 
consider establishing radio caches to support outside agencies.”  
Recommendations: 
• 
As the new 700/800 MHz shared system is implemented, continue to include local, state, and federal 
agencies (e.g., Louisiana State Police, National Guard, New Orleans Police Department) in 
multidiscipline multijurisdictional communications in future exercises and day-to-day use 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

Technology Overview    
The City of New Orleans operates a MA-COM 800 MHz radio system with police, fire, emergency medical services, 
and city government.  Since Hurricane Katrina, the agencies in the surrounding area typically operate on 800 MHz, 
Project 25 (P25) radios working on the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office radio system and have, at times, operated on the 
state 700 MHz radio system.  The NOMIC system has the only regional gateway, an ACU-1000.  Interoperability is 
achieved by use of the gateway, shared proprietary radio systems, and NPSPAC channels for mutual aid responses.  
The UA is moving to a single, shared, dual-mode 700/800 MHz, fully P25-compliant, digital, trunked radio system that 
will eliminate the requirement for gateways or patches between multiple disparate radio systems within the area.  The 
regional system will be connected to the state 700 MHz System.  Events since Hurricane Katrina have indicated that 
gateways and patches cannot handle the volume of voice communications traffic at the tactical level during a major 
event.  Gateways and patches may be able to handle limited command and control voice communications traffic at a 
more strategic level. 
Limited financial resources preclude the purchase of radios for radio caches within the area.  The UA must rely on grant 
funding for the purchase of most of its communications equipment and must ensure day to day operability before 
investing in additional interoperability requirements.

The Central Maryland Area Radio Communications (CMARC) committee includes local, state, federal, and 
private agencies (e.g., Maryland Department of Transportation, Mayor’s Office, Maryland Institute for 
Emergency Medical Services Systems, Amtrak, and Aberdeen Proving Ground).  Baltimore officials reported 
that published and active agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding [MOU]) are in place to ensure 
communications interoperability, yet the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) does not 
include reference to such agreements.  There is a mix of formal and informal partnerships among the UA’s 
public safety organizations.  Officials report that the Baltimore UA is currently developing a strategic plan 
for regional interoperable communications, but the entity responsible for strategic planning is not specified in 
the documentation (i.e., Baltimore Urban Area Working Group, CMARC, and the Region 20 Committee all 
appear to have responsibility for long-term planning).  Organizations within the UA procure equipment and 
develop budgets with some consideration for interoperability needs, but an overarching regional funding 
strategy (e.g., for communications equipment, operations and maintenance) is not documented.  The UA’s 
senior leadership is actively involved in advocating for interoperable communications priorities and has 
demonstrated an understanding of its importance (e.g., Mayor’s Office involvement in CMARC). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of the governance groups (e.g., CMARC, Baltimore 
Urban Area Working Group, Region 20 Committee) identified in TICP 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs) in the TICP, and store them in an accessible format 
•

process in the TICP; however, the schedule is date specific and could benefit from defining a regular training 
interval.  Although TICP validation exercise participants showed an understanding of SOPs, the Baltimore 
UA has been implementing National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System 
(ICS) for only 6 months.  The UA includes all first responders and additional public safety organizations in 
SOP training.  During the exercise, the participants displayed a familiarity with ICS and unified command 
protocols and procedures (e.g., unified command established with law enforcement, fire, and hazardous 
materials agencies), but had specific difficulties with NIMS/ICS (e.g., Communications Unit Leader not 
actively involved in coordination of incident communications, ICS Form 205 not distributed).  Although the 
TICP validation exercise and provided documentation show progress on SOP implementation, it should be 
noted that the TICP itself did not include specific references to or descriptions of regional SOPs that may be 
applied in incident response. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Expand the TICP to reference and document all regional interoperability SOPs 
• 
Consider scheduling a regular review and update process of policies and procedures 
•

The UA frequently uses its means of available interoperable communications in day-to-day, task force, and 
mutual aid incidents (e.g., gateways, shared systems, shared channels, radio cache).  Additionally, officials in 
the UA report proficiency in using interoperable equipment (e.g., common talk groups used for interoperable 
communications in the recent hazardous material spill on highway I-83).  During the TICP validation 
exercise, participants successfully established interoperable communications within local and regional 
responders (e.g., Cecil, Baltimore, and Harford County law enforcement, fire, and emergency  
medical services).  Due to the limited scope of the exercise; however, it appears that the level of state and 
federal participation (beyond Maryland State Highway Patrol) was insufficient to demonstrate 
communications interoperability across levels of government. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider including federal agencies (e.g., Aberdeen Proving Ground) in future exercises  
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises
