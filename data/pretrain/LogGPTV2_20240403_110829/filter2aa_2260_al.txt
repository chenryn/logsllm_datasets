### Intermediate Implementation

#### Usage:
The Baton Rouge Urban Area (UA) encompasses the City of Baton Rouge and the following parishes: Ascension, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Iberville, Livingston, Pointe Coupee, West Baton Rouge, and West Feliciana.

#### Governance: Early Implementation
- **Current Status**: The UA is transitioning from traditional, siloed operational approaches to a more collaborative, regional mindset that supports interoperability.
- **Interoperability Committee**: An Interoperability Committee exists within the Urban Area Security Initiative, but its membership is primarily composed of emergency management agencies. The UA is working to involve additional first responder disciplines and seeks more state and federal participation.
- **Challenges**: Agreements among agencies are largely informal, and no strategic plan has been developed to coordinate planning efforts in the UA. Although leaders support communications interoperability, a long-term fiscal strategy (beyond federal grants) for improving regional interoperability has not been established.

#### Recommendations:
- Ensure representation from all first responder agencies across the UA in the governance group, and clarify roles, responsibilities, and relationships.
- Establish the Region II Interoperability Committee through a formal charter, including all local, public support, state, and federal agencies (e.g., public health, utilities), and document their roles and responsibilities.
- Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memoranda of understanding [MOUs] with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies related to regional interoperability.
- Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and store them in an accessible format.
- Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that includes a long-term communications funding strategy (in addition to grants).
- Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
- Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding that is consistent with the strategic plan.
- Broaden and champion a governance structure that will support regional communications interoperability and involve senior regional government leadership in long-term funding plans.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Intermediate Implementation

#### Current Status:
- The Baton Rouge TICP provided the first regional interoperability SOPs for the UA. Despite strong representation from throughout the UA in the development of the TICP, the documentation does not indicate the extent to which these policies have been accepted.
- Based on the TICP validation exercise, more work is needed to promulgate and practice these procedures. SOPs have not been officially disseminated to all area organizations.
- Baton Rouge officials are addressing this need by developing a remote training program through the Emergency Operations Center network to support SOPs training.

#### Recommendations:
- Develop regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) with acceptance by first responder agencies across jurisdictions and disciplines.
- Distribute and put SOPs into practice through regular training, exercises, and usage (e.g., communications interoperability among the eight parishes).
- Consider scheduling a regular review and update process for developed policies and procedures.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Intermediate Implementation

#### Current Status:
- Officials in Baton Rouge indicated that they use numerous shared radio systems (e.g., six 800 MHz systems, two UHF systems, one VHF system) and shared channels daily for multi-agency communications.
- Gateways are regularly used to connect disparate systems, but difficulties were observed during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., use of 10 codes). Many participants resorted to commercial cellular technology when faced with technical difficulties.
- Evaluators noted that cell phones were used at all levels of command for critical communications across jurisdictions, which would be ineffective if commercial infrastructure were damaged or during high-traffic periods (e.g., hurricane preparation and response).

#### Recommendations:
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for regional communications interoperability resources (e.g., deactivation of gateways, use of talk groups) to improve proficiency.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

### Technology Overview

- The UA uses disparate VHF, UHF, and non-Project 25 (P25) 800 MHz systems.
- The UA is moving toward integrating its public safety system with the State of Louisiana’s new 800 MHz P25 radio system.
- Currently, the UA is planning to purchase subscriber units for many local agencies, assess P25 backward compatibility features for some local communities, and apply National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee frequencies for mutual aid.

### New Orleans, LA

#### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance**: Advanced Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)**: Established Implementation
- **Usage**: Intermediate Implementation

#### Louisiana Urban Area (UA) Region 1
- Includes the City of New Orleans, Orleans Parish, and mutual aid partners Jefferson, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines parishes.

#### Governance: Advanced Implementation
- **Post-Hurricane Katrina**: New Orleans has seen unprecedented involvement from all levels of government in the oversight of communications interoperability.
- **New Orleans Regional Communications Group**: Provides recommendations to the Louisiana Region 1 Board of Directors, inclusive of state and federal representatives.
- **Formal Agreements**: In place for the use of the New Orleans Maritime Interoperable Committee (NOMIC) system, with additional agreements adopted since Hurricane Katrina.
- **Strategic Plan**: A regional strategic plan is accepted by all included agencies, though a long-term funding strategy beyond federal grants is needed.

#### Recommendations:
- Define the governance structure in the TICP to document the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of the governance groups (e.g., New Orleans Regional Communications Group).
- Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Develop a funding strategy for identifying sustainable funding sources (in addition to grants) to cover lifecycle and recurring costs to operate the area’s interoperability assets.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation

#### Current Status:
- The New Orleans TICP is based on existing policies and procedures (e.g., NOMIC gateways procedures) and lessons learned from reviews of SOPs after Hurricane Katrina.
- The UA has taken steps to disseminate and train on the SOPs, but ongoing training and regular review are critical to address gaps encountered during the validation exercise (e.g., gateway policies not followed).
- NIMS/ICS has been a focus of training and is now mandated through city ordinance and executive order in all four parishes.

#### Recommendations:
- Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP.
- Continue to implement regional interoperability SOPs across all participating agencies.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include TICP implementation of communications unit) and for NIMS/ICS to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Intermediate Implementation

#### Current Status:
- New Orleans prioritizes regular testing and exercise to ensure familiarity with new technology, as demonstrated by the TICP validation exercise held after the partial activation of the City of New Orleans’ newly acquired 700/800 MHz system.
- The exercise exposed gaps in the use of the new system and the NOMIC fixed gateway system, with some participants having only one hour of training.
- The UA eventually incorporated both state and federal agencies in the validation exercise through the use of NPSPAC channels and the NOMIC system.

#### Recommendations:
- As the new 700/800 MHz shared system is implemented, continue to include local, state, and federal agencies (e.g., Louisiana State Police, National Guard, New Orleans Police Department) in multidiscipline, multijurisdictional communications in future exercises and day-to-day use.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities.

### Technology Overview

- The City of New Orleans operates a MA-COM 800 MHz radio system with police, fire, EMS, and city government.
- Since Hurricane Katrina, surrounding agencies typically operate on 800 MHz, P25 radios on the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office radio system and, at times, on the state 700 MHz radio system.
- The NOMIC system has the only regional gateway, an ACU-1000, achieving interoperability through the gateway, shared proprietary radio systems, and NPSPAC channels for mutual aid responses.
- The UA is moving to a single, shared, dual-mode 700/800 MHz, fully P25-compliant, digital, trunked radio system to eliminate the need for gateways or patches between multiple disparate radio systems within the area.
- Limited financial resources preclude the purchase of radios for radio caches, so the UA relies on grant funding for most communications equipment and must ensure day-to-day operability before investing in additional interoperability requirements.

### Baltimore, MD

#### Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

**Summary:**
- **Governance**: Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)**: Established Implementation
- **Usage**: Established Implementation

#### Baltimore Urban Area (UA)
- Includes Baltimore City, Annapolis City, Baltimore County, Anne Arundel County, Carroll County, Harford County, and Howard County.

#### Governance: Established Implementation
- **CMARC Committee**: Includes local, state, federal, and private agencies (e.g., Maryland Department of Transportation, Mayor’s Office, Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems, Amtrak, and Aberdeen Proving Ground).
- **Agreements**: Published and active agreements (e.g., MOUs) are in place, but the TICP does not reference these agreements.
- **Strategic Planning**: The Baltimore UA is developing a strategic plan for regional interoperable communications, but the entity responsible for strategic planning is not specified. An overarching regional funding strategy is not documented.
- **Leadership Involvement**: Senior leadership is actively involved in advocating for interoperable communications priorities and understands its importance.

#### Recommendations:
- Clarify the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of the governance groups (e.g., CMARC, Baltimore Urban Area Working Group, Region 20 Committee) identified in the TICP.
- Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs) in the TICP and store them in an accessible format.
- Document and formalize agreements (e.g., signed MOUs with defined roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability.
- Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant.
- Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications funding strategy (in addition to grants).
- Identify the organization responsible for regional strategic planning processes.
- Clarify whether long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding exists (to include interoperable communications asset procurement) that is consistent with strategic planning efforts.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation

#### Current Status:
- Baltimore incorporated previously existing policies and procedures (e.g., 800 MHz shared system SOPs and mutual aid channels SOPs) into the TICP.
- The UA has disseminated these SOPs to participating organizations and documented a training process in the TICP, though the schedule is date-specific and could benefit from a regular training interval.
- Participants showed an understanding of SOPs, but the UA has been implementing NIMS/ICS for only 6 months. During the exercise, participants displayed familiarity with ICS and unified command protocols but had specific difficulties with NIMS/ICS (e.g., Communications Unit Leader not actively involved, ICS Form 205 not distributed).

#### Recommendations:
- Expand the TICP to reference and document all regional interoperability SOPs.
- Consider scheduling a regular review and update process for policies and procedures.
- Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Established Implementation

#### Current Status:
- The UA frequently uses available interoperable communications in day-to-day, task force, and mutual aid incidents (e.g., gateways, shared systems, shared channels, radio cache).
- Officials report proficiency in using interoperable equipment (e.g., common talk groups used for interoperable communications in a recent hazardous material spill on highway I-83).
- During the TICP validation exercise, participants successfully established interoperable communications within local and regional responders, but state and federal participation (beyond Maryland State Highway Patrol) was insufficient to demonstrate full interoperability.

#### Recommendations:
- Consider including federal agencies (e.g., Aberdeen Proving Ground) in future exercises.
- Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

- The Baltimore UA has five 800 MHz mobile relay frequencies for use as shared channels for all interoperable communications.
- Caches compatible with 800 MHz frequencies are available.
- Six 800 MHz trunked systems are used for interoperable communications among local police departments, fire departments, and emergency medical services, as well as federal and state law enforcement.
- Six direct channels will be available for interoperability in the near future.
