Instructions for this and the next couple of lessons are some what misleading
when explaining what + does in regex syntax.
Instructions state + is need to find 'one or more occurrences of this pattern'
which is not correct. In the example given + would find the letters an
followed by 1 or more d's, and not multiple and's.
Also, the tests expect and+ when + is not required to find an the occurrences
of and in the sentence.
