### Detection Expansion and Performance

Our method detects a significant number of additional malicious host paths, with an expansion rate of over 7 times when using 48.59% of other malicious host paths as seeds. As the percentage of seed malicious HICs (Host-Induced Clusters) increases, the recall and expansion rates gradually converge, approaching the maximum recall achievable.

### Detection of New Malicious Paths

In addition to identifying already labeled malicious paths, our method can detect previously unidentified malicious paths. For example, using 90% of labeled malicious HICs as seeds, we discovered over 20,000 new malicious host paths. These newly detected paths were primarily crawled from Top-site and Twitter feeds, involving 6,080 unique host names. Manual analysis revealed that most of these cases were not detected by Forefront because they used HTTP status codes (e.g., 302) for redirection without relying on malicious code, or their script signatures were not included in Forefront's database.

### False Detection and False Positive Rates

We evaluated the false detection and false positive rates, as shown in Figure 8(b). For newly detected malicious HICs, we used several validation methods, including comparison against the Google Safebrowsing list, content clustering analysis, and URL pattern analysis. For the remaining unresolved cases, we conducted manual verification. Our validation process indicated a very low false positive rate (FPR) of less than 0.025%. The false detection rate (FDR) was also low, at 0.34% when using 5% seeds. However, as the number of seeds increased, the FDR rose, reaching up to 2.36% in the worst case due to potential impurities in the seed data.

### Seed Rolling for Improved Coverage

To enhance detection coverage, we implemented a "seed rolling" process, where the set of detected results is fed back as new seeds, and PageRank scores are recalculated. This process can be iterated multiple times. Using 5% known malicious HICs as initial seeds and iterating the detection three times, we significantly increased the detection coverage. The number of detected host paths grew from 242,776 (48.59%) to 361,675 (72.38%), resulting in over 12 times the initial expansion. Additionally, this process helped us discover 30,358 new host paths, while maintaining a relatively low FDR of 2.63%.

### Comparison with In-Degree Based Approach

Previous studies have proposed using topological features like "in-degrees" to rank malicious sites. We compared our PageRank-based approach with an in-degree based approach. The in-degree based approach, which identifies a site as malicious if it receives traffic from many other malicious sites, resulted in higher false detection rates. This is because legitimate sites, such as google.com, may also frequently receive redirected traffic from malicious sites. Our PageRank-based approach, on the other hand, achieved lower FDRs. For instance, with 5% seeds, our detector identified 508 malicious HICs with in-degrees ranging from 1 to 3,514, indicating its ability to detect both large central servers and smaller dedicated servers involved in malicious activities.

### Sensitivity to Different Seed Types

We investigated the sensitivity of our detection results to different types of seed data. We compared the results using two types of feeds: drive-by-download feed and a combined Top-site and Twitter feed. Both sets of seeds produced similar numbers of detected host names, with low FDRs. This demonstrates the generalizability of our approach across different seed data. Despite the different sources, there was a significant overlap in the detected results, with 29.91% of host names and 37.09% of host paths detected in both cases.

### Detection of Scam Attacks

Using seeds from the drive-by-download feed, we detected scam attacks from the WarningBird feed. With all bad seeds from the drive-by-download feed, we identified 6 overlapping malicious host names and 4,125 (56.21%) overlapping malicious host paths. These hosts, not directly flagged by Forefront, were detected through PageRank. Many of these paths went through an open-source tracker kit, suggesting that attackers are leveraging dedicated services from various channels for different purposes.

### Role Analysis of Malicious HICs

The low false positive rates indicate that the detected HICs are likely dedicated malicious entities. To understand their roles, we categorized the URLs associated with these HICs. The roles include exploit servers, scam hosts, redirectors, and others. Redirectors, which make up 70.4% of the detected HICs, play active roles in 80% of the malicious paths. Among these, 31.98% run Traffic Distribution Systems (TDS), which are extensively used in underground ecosystems. Several large TDSes, with obvious URL patterns, accounted for 56.25% of the malicious paths. Given their importance, we conducted an in-depth study on TDSes to understand their characteristics and monetization strategies.

### In-Depth Study on TDS

Over 50% of the malicious paths go through Traffic Distribution Systems (TDS), which act as underground traffic brokers. These systems buy traffic from generators (e.g., malicious doorways) and sell it to consumers (e.g., exploit servers). TDSes facilitate traffic exchanges between malicious parties, allowing attack executors to focus on managing their attacks rather than procuring traffic. Our research focused on TDSes, revealing their significant roles in malicious activities, long lifespan (median of 65.21 days), and continued monetization even after being parked (receiving up to 10 times more traffic than legitimate parking domains).

#### Landscape of TDS
To understand how TDSes operate, we analyzed the tool kits they use, their popularity, traffic sources, and destinations. We found that TDSes connect to over 52.67% of doorway URLs and play a crucial role in the malicious ecosystem.
