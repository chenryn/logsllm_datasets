### Dataset and Query Results

The smallest dataset in our study consists of 467,696 visitors. Table 2 summarizes the results of all our queries. In total, we collected and queried 53 Font, 46 Canvas, and 16 WebGL fingerprints. Interestingly, many crawlers continued to carry the same Browser Fingerprint (BFP) as those observed in our longitudinal study, despite a 6-month time difference. For example, all fingerprints collected from APWG and SmartScreen were already seen in the previous study. In total, 71.3% of the fingerprints were previously collected.

### Stability of Fingerprints

Canvas and Font fingerprints are relatively stable for a user, with a median lifetime of more than 9 months [47]. For some crawlers, such as PhishTank and Bitdefender, the markers on the y-axis refer to multiple fingerprints. If at least one of these fingerprints was found in the previous study, we marked that point as solid.

### Prevalence of Fingerprints

Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c) show the distribution of fingerprint prevalence by crawler over time. The table below shows the distribution of prevalence (in %) of the three types of fingerprints, broken down by each crawler. Similar to results from prior privacy-oriented studies [29], most fingerprints are very rare, with only a few being prevalent in more than 1% of the visitors. For instance, 20 Font fingerprints were unique and not seen among any of the visitors.

| Crawler | #IPs | #Font FPs | %Sum | #Canvas FPs | %Sum |
|---------|------|-----------|------|-------------|------|
| APWG    | 2726 | 7         | 0.05 | 7           | 0.02 |
| Bitdefender | 62  | 46        | 7.73 | 38          | 4.99 |
| GSB     | 619  | 2         | 0.25 | 2           | 0.07 |
| SmartScreen | 50   | 13        | 0.98 | 8           | 1.61 |
| PhishTank | 4096 | 55        | 19.5 | 69          | 10.25 |
| VT Bucket | 7795 | 11        | 10.47 | 97         | 10.25 |

### Diverse Repeated Reporting Experiment

In August 2020, we conducted a control experiment to study the potential effects of repeated reporting of token URLs from diverse sources on the profiling information collected from crawlers. During our 10-week longitudinal study, we registered a single domain and reported each token site’s subdomain created under it only once to each crawler. To replicate this setup, we created 50 different subdomains under a single .xyz domain (called SR). We then set up an alternate configuration for diverse and repeated reporting (DRR) by using 5 different .xyz TLDs.

On a single day, we used PhishPrint to report each of the 50 SR URLs to 10 different crawlers from a U.S. IP address. On the same day, we used a private VPN provider to connect to 10 IP addresses located in 7 different countries and submitted 10 reports on each domain in the DRR set to all 10 crawlers. For crawlers like Outlook and APWG, which use email reporting, we created and used 10 different email addresses for each domain in the DRR set. This setup ensured an equal number of URL reports (50 to each crawler) to keep the comparison balanced.

Table 3 shows an overview of the comparison between the profiling results obtained from the two configurations. Despite repeated diverse reporting, the URLs reported via the SR configuration involved more sessions and more crawler IP addresses. This could be due to some crawlers deliberately ignoring repeated reports, even if they come from diverse sources. For example, PhishTank’s website shows an error message stating the URL is already submitted, even if we try to do a repeat submission from a different account.

| Configuration | # Sessions | #IPs | Jaccard Similarity (IPs) | Jaccard Similarity (ASs) |
|---------------|------------|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| SR            | 954        | 799  | 0.046                    | 0.54                     |
| DRR           | 291        | 188  | 0.046                    | 0.54                     |

### Evading Security Crawlers

Our analysis of the profiling data from the crawlers showed that five of the six cloaking vectors we devised can exploit existing weaknesses: Real Browser Anomaly, Crawler Artifacts Anomaly, IP, AS, and BFP Blocklists. In this section, we present supplementary experiments that directly test these five vectors against crawlers and real users to assess their evadability benefits and false positive consequences.

### Phishing Experiments

To confirm the real-world utility of these vectors, we built phishing websites powered with the candidate cloaking vectors, self-reported them to crawlers, and measured how long they would survive without getting blocked in any of the browsers. Our approach is similar to prior works [37, 39].

#### Setup

We built two kinds of phishing websites: Baseline sites (no cloaking) and PhishPrint-cloaked sites (using all five cloaking vectors). The cloaked sites show benign content if any of the five vectors decide the visitor should be given a cloaked page. The phishing payload remains encrypted (using AES-256) until the cloaking logic returns a key to the client. We used two simulated phishing payloads: "PayPal" and "Bank of America." For benign payloads, we created simple web pages discussing topics such as food and famous personalities.

We started the experiment 25 days after deploying the Profiling Module to allow the IP and BFP blocklists to be populated. We monitored the sites using Chrome, IE, and Opera desktop browsers, which employ different blocklists (GSB, SmartScreen, and Opera).

#### Results

The results show that our 6 baseline sites were quickly blocked on all browsers. Chrome (GSB) was the quickest, blocking the sites in 3 hours and 10 minutes. All browsers blocked the 6 sites in about 10.5 hours. On the other hand, none of the 20 PhishPrint-cloaked sites were blocked in the first four days despite repeated reporting to all the crawlers. In the one-month monitoring period, only 2 sites (A and B) got blocked. Site A was blocked on day 58, and site B was taken down by the xyz registrar on day 16 due to an abuse report. The remaining 18 cloaked sites continued to be functional throughout the monitoring period.

### User Study Experiment

To study the specificity of these vectors, we conducted a user study on the MTurk platform. After obtaining prior user consent, users were exposed to a web page with the same client-side fingerprinting code and server-side cloaking logic as in the phishing experiments, but without the phishing payloads. We made measurements of whether or not any of the cloaking vectors decided to show cloaked content to the visiting users.

We received an exemption from our university IRB board for this experiment and took measures to not store any sensitive information persistently. We performed this experiment from the third week of February 2020 to the first week of March 2020. 1150 unique users participated, with 66% from the United States and the remaining 34% spread across 35 countries in 6 continents. The results showed that PhishPrint-powered cloaking logic decided to show phishing content for 79% of the users (76.1% for U.S. users and 81.4% for non-U.S. users).

### False Positive Analysis

Breaking down the 21% false positive rate by cloaking vectors, we saw the following numbers:
- BFP Blocklist: 17.5%
- AS Blocklist: 1.7%
- Crawler Artifacts: 1%
- Real Browser: 0.7%
- IP Blocklist: 0.1%

To understand the overlap between BFPs of MTurk users and crawlers, we conducted a second MTurk study in January 2021 with 1007 participants, collecting 592 distinct BFPs. While 469 of the collected fingerprints are unique, there are also 123 "shared" fingerprints, each belonging to at least 2 users. The two most popular shared fingerprints were among 23 and 20 users, respectively. More than 25% of the shared fingerprints are shared among at least 5 users, and more than 55% are shared among at least 3 users each. This indicates that while there are many unique fingerprints, there also exist many shared fingerprints with no small subset being extremely dominant.
