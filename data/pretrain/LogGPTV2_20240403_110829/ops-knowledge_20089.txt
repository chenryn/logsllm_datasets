User: I would like to change my PATH from Python 2.6.1 to 3.1.2. I  have both versions installed on my computer, but when I type python --version in the terminal I get Python 2.6.1. So, thats the current version it's "pointing" to. Now if I type python3.1 it loads the  version I want to use, although the PATH is still pointing to 2.6.1. Downloaded along with the Python 3.1 package comes an Update Shell Profile.command - when I run it and then run nano  ~/.bash_profile it says:

Setting PATH for Python 3.1 the orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH.

Does this mean that I have changed the PATH, or does it just giving me instructions how to?
Assistant: i managed to fixed mine by removing python2, i don't if it's a good practice
