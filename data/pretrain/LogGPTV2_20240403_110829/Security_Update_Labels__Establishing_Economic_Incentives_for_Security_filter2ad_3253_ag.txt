all dimensions. For all factors of PC1 and PC2, Cronbach’s
alpha was above the recommended threshold of .700 (>.804)
and item-to-total correlation higher than the threshold of .500
(>.524), indicating high reliability and internal consistency of
the perceived security risk scale [63].
C. Consistent Akaike Information Criterion
The consistent Akaike information criterion (CAIC) is rec-
ommended by Sawtooth Software as measure to decide on the
number of reasonable segments [100] for latent-class analysis.
Due to the sample size (cf. Section VI-C), we were interested
in splitting the respondents into either 2 or 3 groups, for which
the latent-class analysis provided the corresponding proposals.
Each segmentation proposal has a CAIC score. Smaller values
of CAIC are desired [100]. For the segmentation of the
respondents that evaluated the smart home camera, the CAIC
score was 14,162 for 2 groups and 14,307 for 3 groups. For
the segmentation of the respondents that evaluated the smart
weather station, the CAIC score was 14,471 for 2 groups and
14,260 for 3 groups. In summary, for the smart home cameras,
the smaller CAIC score indicated 3 groups, while for smart
weather, the smaller CAIC score indicated 2 groups.
