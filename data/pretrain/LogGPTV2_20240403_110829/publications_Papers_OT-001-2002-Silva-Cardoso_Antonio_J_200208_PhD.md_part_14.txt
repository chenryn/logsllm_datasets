### Resolving Structural and Semantic Heterogeneity in Web Services

#### Introduction
Web services often use different data structures and class hierarchies to define their interface parameters, leading to structural heterogeneity. Additionally, semantic heterogeneity arises when the intended meanings of terms used in labeling input and output parameters differ. For effective interoperability, the data exchanged between Web services must be understood. Semantic conflicts occur when the interpretation of information being transferred between a Web service's output and another service's or task's input does not match. A common approach to address this is to map local terms onto a shared ontology. While a shared ontology ensures total integration, constructing such an ontology can be costly and impractical, especially as autonomous systems need to commit to it, and maintaining compromises with new concepts is challenging (Rodr√≠guez and Egenhofer 2002).

#### Motivation and Approach
Our work aims to enhance workflow systems with better mechanisms for e-service composition, specifically focusing on the development of new methods for Web service discovery and integration. Our novel method provides a multidimensional approach to Web service discovery and integration, leveraging syntactic, semantic, and operational metrics (Figure 4-1).

**Figure 4-1: Multidimensional Approach to Web Service Discovery and Integration**

| **Syntactic Description** | **Operational Metrics** | **Semantic Information** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Web Service Discovery     | Web Service Integration  |                          |

#### Specific Requirements and Challenges
The discovery and integration of Web services into e-workflows present unique challenges compared to traditional information retrieval and integration systems. Our methodology addresses the following objectives:

- **Increase Precision in Discovery:** The search should consider not only syntactic information but also operational metrics and semantics.
- **Represent Operational Metrics:** Use a suitable model to describe the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics (Cardoso, Sheth et al. 2002).
- **Automate Integration Degree Determination:** Automatically determine the degree of integration of discovered Web services with the workflow host.
- **Schema Integration:** Unlike previous work on schema integration, the polarity of schemas requires that an output schema connects to an input schema, and all input parameters must be satisfied.

#### Scenario: Travel Authorization Request e-Workflow
A designer is composing an e-workflow to manage travel authorization requests for conferences. The workflow includes tasks such as Get Conference Information, Get User Information, Travel Reservation, and Hotel Reservation (Figure 4-2).

**Figure 4-2: Travel Authorization Request e-Workflow**

| **Conference Registry** | **Hotel Reservation Service** | **Get Itinerary** | **Start A End** | **Travel Reservation** | **Employee ID** | **Get User Information** |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|

The e-workflow operates by first obtaining approval, then executing the necessary tasks. The designer faces the challenge of manually finding and integrating a suitable Web service for the Travel Reservation task, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

#### Composition Problems
The designer encounters two main problems:
1. **Discovery:** Locating a Web service with the desired functionality and operational metrics.
2. **Integration:** Resolving structural and semantic differences between the found service and existing tasks.

Efficient discovery mechanisms are essential, as manual discovery is impractical given the large number of available services. The discovery process should account for operational metrics and interfaces, and the integration should maximize the degree of interoperability.

#### Workflow Tasks and Web Service Specifications
We use ontologies to semantically describe task and Web service interfaces, enhancing the success of information discovery and integration (Berners-Lee and Fischetti 1999; Fensel and Musen 2001). Ontologies provide an explicit specification of conceptualization, making the content and function of task interfaces clear and facilitating integration.

**Figure 4-3: Association of Task Inputs and Outputs with Concepts**

| **Data Objects** | **Ontology** | **XML Schema** | **Task Interfaces** | **Local Ontology** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Date**         | **Time-Ontology** | **Temporal-Entity** | **Inputs/Outputs** | **Calendar-Date** |
| **Duration**     |              |                |                    | **Event**          |
| **City**         |              |                |                    | **Scientific-Event** |

Each input and output data class parameter is associated with an ontological concept class, assuming a one-to-one mapping. Primitive data types are represented using XML Schema, providing a comprehensive data type hierarchy.

#### Web Service Specification
Two main approaches have been proposed for Web service specification:
1. **Declarative and Structured Data:** Based purely on syntax, such as WSDL and XLANG.
2. **Semantic Orientation:** Using DAML-S for a more semantic description of Web services.

#### Conclusion
This paper presents a multidimensional approach to Web service discovery and integration, addressing the specific requirements and challenges of e-workflows. By leveraging syntactic, semantic, and operational metrics, our method enhances the precision and effectiveness of e-service composition. Future work will focus on implementing and testing the proposed algorithm and architecture.
