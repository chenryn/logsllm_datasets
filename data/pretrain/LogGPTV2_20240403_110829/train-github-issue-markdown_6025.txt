# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.836]
    PowerToys version: v 0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): PowerToys Run (ish)
# Steps to reproduce
It used to be "Press CTRL+WIN"...
An alternative:
  * Open chrome (or any similar browser)
  * Hide the browser window
  * Press alt+space and type "Chrome"
  * Select the first option
# Expected behavior
The main reason I starting using PowerToys was for the amazing Launcher. I
understood it was replaced by the Run tool that has an integrated Window
Walker.
I expect to be able to run the "alt-tab" alternative tool and just that. Not a
mix that makes using an alternative to alt tab worse than alt-tabbing.
# Actual behavior
CTRL+WIN doesn't do anything anymore. Function is disabled  
ALT+Space runs the new Run, however the alt+tab feature is gone. Selecting,
for example, the browser will just open a new instance of chrome, instead of
"alt-tabbing" to the open app.
I'd just like to use the "Window walker" integration. Separated from the Wox
and alike features.
# Screenshots
Here's a quick GIF.
  * I have an open Chrome browser.
  * I switch focus to windows terminal
  * Alt+space to open the search bar and type "chrome"
  * Select first option
  * As a result, it just opens a new chrome browser instance instead of switching to the existing one in the background.
