used as the training set ST for attack, while other 20000 CRPs are 
used as the testing set for evaluating the CRP prediction accuracy 
(fitness  of  FPUF  under  testing  set).  On  the  other  hand,  due  to 
variations of working circumstances, the CRPs may be unreliable. 
According to [12][13], the reliability of both current mirror PUF 
and voltage transfer PUF is around 98%. The experimental results 
are shown in Table 1, where maximum number of iterations is 106.

and  voltage  transfer  PUFs  have  32-bit  challenge,  the  average 
prediction  accuracy  achieves  99.9%.  Even  when  NC  is  128,  the 
average prediction accuracy is still beyond 98%. The unreliability 
of  training  set  causes  a  slight  decrease  of  prediction  accuracy. 
This can be handled by obtaining the training set in a more stable 
working circumstance. The time of attack is from several minutes 
to  several  hours.  In  comparison  with  SVM  based  attack  used  in 
[12][13],  this  data  reveals  that  the  current  mirror  PUF  and  the 
voltage transfer PUF are not as secure as claimed in [12][13]. 
To explore the relation among time, NP, and prediction accuracy, 
we illustrate the attack process of a voltage transfer PUF in Fig.2 
and  Fig.3  when  reliability  is  100%.  Fig.2  shows  the  prediction 
accuracy at different Iteration of Alg.1, while NP is set as Table 1. 
With  more  iterations,  longer  time  is  spent  to  achieve  higher 
prediction  accuracy.  For  PUFs  with  more  challenge  bits,  more 
iterations are needed to achieve higher prediction accuracy. Please 
notice that, with the increasing of Iteration in Alg.1, the highest 
fitness  of  FPUFs  to  training  set  will  never  decrease,  but  the 
fitness of FPUFs to testing set, i.e. the prediction accuracy shown 
in Fig.2, may decrease. Fig.3 shows the prediction accuracy when 
different sizes of training set are used, while maximum number of 
iterations  is  106.  With  larger  training  set,  higher  prediction 
accuracy can be obtained.

5.  CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes compound heuristic algorithms of evolution 
strategy, simulated annealing, and ant colony to attack non-linear 
PUFs: the current mirror PUF and the voltage transfer PUF. The 
average  prediction  accuracy achieves  99%,  so  it  reveals  that the 
current mirror PUF and the voltage transfer PUF are not as secure 
as being claimed. More efficient designs for resisting attacks are 
still highly needed.
