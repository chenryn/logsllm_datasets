If the results are too overwhelming, you can use the following structure to filter the content
>resent only a portion of the available options. Overall, resort to custom Google 
searches when new services appear. As I write this, I am monitoring new sites such as Parler (parler.com), Gab 
(gab.com), and Gettr (gettr.com), all of which claim to be the next generation of social networks. The search 
techniques previously presented throughout this book also apply to these new platforms. Let's briefly dissect 
each.
Literally translated as "Everyone's Website", Renren is a Chinese remake of Facebook. It is one of the most 
popular Chinese social networks. Users earn points for activities such as logging in, posting status messages, 
commenting, and receiving comments. As users earn points, their level on the site increases, which unlocks 
special emoticons, profile skins, and the ability to go "invisible" and view other users' profiles without their 
knowledge. The home page does not allow profile search, but browse.renren.com does. Clicking on any profiles 
from this query will prompt you to sign in to an account However, a targeted site search should eliminate this. 
The following Google search identified several various pages that contained Michael Smith.
Qzone is typically used as a blogging and diary platform. Most of the loyalty to the platform is due to the 
popularity of the instant messaging tool "QQ". This is a one-to-one messaging platform, so opportunities for 
public search are not present. The search options on qq.com pages provide results similar to Chinese search 
engines such as Baidu. The searches are not restricted to the social network profiles. I have found the following 
search on Google or Baidu to work best for English queries. Replace "michael smith" with your target's real 
name or username.
Taringa has a presence in every country in the Spanish-speaking world. Its main markets are Argentina, Spain, 
Colombia, Chile, Peru, and the U.S. Latino community. The search functionality is fairly straightforward, but 
the following URLs may produce more efficient results.
The links connect direcdy to profiles, which can be browsed as normal. These will appear very similar to 
Facebook profiles. The upper-right portion of a profile will announce the date of the user's last login. Most of 
the profile details arc public, and do not require any type of URL trickery in order to expose the details.
Parler is indexed by Google, so the following queries should identify data of interest.
Once you identify a target profile, such as "inteltechniques”, the following should disclose details.

Gab has been widely described as a haven for extremists including neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and has 
attracted users who have been banned from other social networks. Gab is not indexed well by Google, but we 
have the following direct query URLs assuming your target is "inteltechniques" and your keyword of interest is 
"bomb".
site:parler.com "keyword" 
site:parler.com/post/ "keyword" 
site:parler.com/profile/ "keyword"
Gettr is a Twitter clone targeted toward far-right political beliefs. The structure of all accounts and feeds follows 
the Twitter examples previously presented. The following would apply if I were a member.

There is no way to predict which social networks will be the next big thing. However, possessing a sharp set of 
Google and OSINT skills will take you far. If desired, you could add these options to the custom search tools 
explained in Section One. Until I see wide-spread usage of these platforms, I ■will wait.

This is the static URL for the most recent comments made within Dissenter about my target Twitter profile. I 
can bookmark this URL and visit it from within any web browser to monitor for new activity. If desired, I could 
set up a Google Alert for change notifications.

• 
While in the Dissenter Browser, navigate to any popular URL, such as our target.
• 
Click the green Dissenter "D" menu and load the comments.
• 
Right-click within the Dissenter overlay and select "Inspect".
• 
Click the "Network" tab within the new window and return to the overlay.
• 
Click the "Latest" tab to see the most recent posts.
• 
Return to the Inspector window and look for an entry beginning with "comment".
In 2019, Gab launched a browser extension and sendee called Dissenter which allowed users to make comments 
on any website via a Gab overlay. This allowed users to bypass any type of moderation from other sendees. A 
few months later, the browser extensions were removed from the Firefox and Chrome sites for violation of 
their policies, but the service lives on through a website and custom browser. This active community mostly 
posts hateful comments about a site's content including threats toward the people associated with the page. Let's 
take a look at a real example. I will use the Twitter profile available at https://www.twitter.com/aoc for all 
demonstrations. The following address displays the active "Discussion" page for this profile.
Documenting all of the posts is a challenge. The overlay presents ten entries at a time and forces click of a 
button to see more. Fortunately, we can use the previous method to simplify’ data collection. Take another look 
at the URL obtained during the previous technique. Let's modify two portions of it. In the following URL, 1 
changed "&s=latest" to "&s=oldest" and "&cpp=10" to "&cpp=50". This loads all comments in chronological 
order and displays 50 comments per page instead of 10.
Clicking "Top", "Controversial", "Latest", and "Oldest" displays various comments from Gab users about this 
person. However, this page identifies only six posts, which is far from complete. Because of this, I never rely 
solely on this method. Instead, I focus on the Dissenter Browser (github.com/gab-ai-inc/gab-dissenter- 
extension). This standalone web browser is based on the Brave fork of Chromium and is maintained by Gab. 
At the time of this writing, only the open-source files were available for compiling your own application. I 
present this section in 2022 in hopes that the project will return with downloadable packages. 1 would never 
consider installing it on my host computer, but it works well within a secure virtual machine. 1 downloaded the 
"deb" file for Linux from dissenter.com into the Downloads folder of my Ubuntu VM; right-clicked the file; 
and selected "Open with Software Install". This installed Dissenter and it was ready for use.
I opened Dissenter and navigated to my target Twitter profile. 1 then clicked the green "D" to the right of the 
URL bar. This presented an overlay window with 231 comments about the person in the profile. Clicking 
"Latest" displayed the most recent posts, visible in Figure 13.09. Clicking the username presents that profile on 
Gab for further investigation. This information may be valuable, but it is not easy to monitor. You would need 
to reload the profile through the Dissenter Browser and refresh the overlay every time. Instead, let's identify the 
best URL.

This does not present all of the comments, so 1 must create a new URL for the next 50. In the following address, 
I changed "p=l" to "p=2". This takes us to the second page of comments. I could create links with "3", "4", 
and "5" in order to collect all comments. Since these are standard web pages, any screen capture utility should 
work. 1 offer a warning about the posts. They are inappropriate to say the least. However, anyone tasked with 
monitoring of hate speech and threats must be aware of this resource. The users possess a sense of superiority

can navigate directly with the following structure.
If you know the name
If you locate a username of interest while searching Reddit, you can load all of that user's posts and comments 
by clicking on the name. Alternatively, the following URL can be used.
The results from such a generic search can be quite overwhelming. With the following URL, we can force Reddit 
to only deliver results if our search term is within the tide of a post, and not simply present within comments.
The official search option on Reddit has been plagued with problems since inception. The search field in th; 
upper right of ever}' page will allow you to query any terms you desire, but the results have not always been 
optimal. In 2016,1 saw the search function improve drastically, and even with some added new features. XXTien 
typing terms into the search field on any Reddit page, the results will be from all pages, including thousands of 
Subreddits. While you should understand this option, and even execute target searches from the home page on 
occasion, we should consider some advanced search options. We can replicate that standard keyword search 
within a URL. This is beneficial for bookmarking searches of interest that need checked often. The format for 
a search about OSINT is as follows.
Contrary to some previous editions, I now start this chapter with Reddit This social news aggregation, web 
content rating, and discussion website went from a place for those "in-the-know" to a resource often cited on 
mainstream media. More users than ever post, reply to, and read the user-submitted content in the form of 
either a link or text, each submitted to a specific category known as a Subreddit. Other users then vote the 
submission up or down, which is used to rank the post and determine its position on the website's pages. The 
submissions are then discussed on the "comments" page of every entry. The Subreddits cover practically any 
topic you can imagine. If your target has the slightest interest in the internet, he or she has probably been to 
Reddit. As of 2020, there were over 1,200,000 Subreddits and over 350 million registered users.
Online communities are very similar to social networks. The thin line which has separated the two is slowly 
disappearing. While social networks cater to a broad audience with many interests, these communities usually 
relate to a specific service or lifestyle. Some online communities do not get indexed by search engines; therefore, 
the presence of a target's participation will not always be found through Google or Bing. Any time that a target's 
interests or hobbies are located through the previous search techniques, you should also seek the online 
communities that cater to that topic. This can often identify information that is very’ personal and private to the 
target. Many people post to these communities without any regard to privacy. Some communities require 
registration to see the content, which is usually free. Occasionally, a cached version of the pages on the site is 
available without registering. This chapter will provide methods of infiltrating these communities to maximize 
the intelligence obtained.
If you want to see a summan’ of all original posts, die following URL can be used.

If you want to see a summary of all original comments, the following URL can be used.

Each of these queries could be replicated within both Bing and Yandex. While Google is good at indexing new 
content within Reddit, I have witnessed better performance from Yandex when the content was associated with 
pornography and other adult content.
You may get lucky with these queries, but the results are often limited. These will display the historic view of a 
Reddit account at a specific moment in time. While this may provide evidence for your investigation, you should 
also identify any further deleted content. In order to dig much deeper, we will rely on Pushshift.
If you have a target website, and you want to know if the URL has 
following URL will display all results.
If Reddit is not providing the results you think you should be receiving, you should return to our previous 
instruction on Google searching. The following query would identify any posts, categories, or users that included 
the word "surveillance".
If you have identified any Reddit content of interest, you should consider checking any online third-part}’ 
archives. These historic representations of an account will often disclose previously deleted or modified content. 
It is extremely common for Reddit users to edit or delete a comment entirely, especially if it was controversial. 
I have investigated numerous Reddit accounts where the evidence I expected to find was not present. First, I 
always search the standard archive options which were previously explained. The following direct URLs would 
attempt to display historic versions of a Reddit user’s profile. You could replace the Reddit user URL within 
each of these with a Subreddit address or Reddit post URL.
Since 2018, Reddit has been changing the layout and function of their website. This also includes many additional 
trackers which collect information about your usage. I prefer the "old" view of Reddit, which can be achieved 
by replacing "www" with "old" within any Reddit link. This is personal preference, and I believe the old view 
provides a more compressed experience which displays more content within each page.
If you wanted to force Google to restrict its searching to a specific Subreddit, such as OSINT, you would add 
"/r/osint" after the first portion. If you wanted to restrict the searching to a specific user, you would add 
"/user/inteltechniques" to the end. The following are two examples.

If you arc seeking a specific post with unique wording, you can accomplish this with the following URL. This 
example would identify public and deleted posts mentioning my username.
This URL presented a lot of information about my deleted posts, but I was most interested in the data visible 
in Figure 14.03. It displayed the entire deleted comment and the subreddit location. Furthermore, it provided a 
Unix time of 1563580052, which converts to Friday, July 19,2019 5:47:32 PM GMT.
This URL will display the most recent 25 posts, regardless of whether they are still on Reddit or have been 
removed. This is a great start, but our target may have thousands of posts. The following URL adds two options 
at the end to force sorting in ascending format and display 1000 comments within a single page.
Each of these searches may present too much content and may not be easy to digest. We can filter unwanted 
content in order to produce less results. The following would repeat our previous search, but only display 
content from the Subreddit Privacy.
This huge archive contains over 500GB of data including the most publicly posted content on Reddit since 
2005. This provides us an amazing collection of most deleted posts. The next time your target wipes out various 
Reddit posts before you can collect the evidence, Pushshift may reveal the deleted content. This site allows you 
to download the entire archive, but that may be overkill for most users. Instead, we can take advantage of their 
robust application programming interface (API). First, let's assume that you are only interested in a specific user 
that has deleted all content. 1 will use my own account as a demonstration. Figure 14.01 displays a partial post 
which 1 created on Friday, July 19, 2019 at 5:47:32 PM GMT. On September 1, 2019,1 deleted all of my posts, 
including that initial content. However, Figure 14.02 displays the result I saw on this same date at 
https://www.reddit.com/user/inteltechniques. As I wrote this in 2020, the following direct URL queried the 
entire data set for any posts that have been archived by Pushshift for user inteltechniques.

Note that all of these searches only identify results which are comments and not user submissions. A submissio 
is a new topic, and a comment is a post within a specific submission. In order to replicate all of these^q 
for user submissions, simply replace "comment" in each example to "submission”. The following 
displays my deleted submissions.
If you wanted to limit results to a single user with a timeframe between 5 days prior to your search and 30 days 
prior to your search, you would navigate directly to the following URL.
https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment/?author=inteltechniques&after=30d&bcfore=5d
In order to demonstrate the value of this, consider the following random example. On November 8, 2020,1 
searched on Twitter for "reddit account" "deleted". The first result was the Tweet seen in Figure 14.04. Reddit 
user Defaultyboi6829 posted on Twitter "Good thing I deleted my Reddit account". On November 10, 2020,1 
navigated to the following URL, which displayed 25 of the most recently deleted comments. His latest post was
