User: Please explain the difference and function of Layer 3 and Layer 4 switches in the network topology.
Assistant: The three-layer and four-layer switches in the network topology are all enterprise-level switches, which play different roles in the network architecture. The main differences and functions are as follows: 1. Different levels: the three-layer switch is the network layer (OSI model layer 3 ) switch, and a four-layer switch is a switch at the transport layer (layer 4 of the OSI model). 2. The goals are different: the three-layer switch is mainly responsible for the forwarding of IP packets, and can group data according to the source IP address or target IP address; while the four-layer switch is based on port switching, which can be based on the information of the source port and the target port. forwarding of data. 3. The scope is different: Layer 3 switches are usually used to build small network segments, while Layer 4 switches are usually used to build large network segments and data centers. 4. Different functions: In addition to supporting common switch functions such as VLAN and QoS, Layer 3 switches can also support routing functions, such as static routing, dynamic routing, etc.; while Layer 4 switches not only support the functions of Layer 3 switches, but also have application load Balance, virtual terminal services, network security and other advanced functions. In short, Layer 3 and Layer 4 switches play different roles in the network, and selecting the appropriate switch according to needs can better improve network performance, security and reliability.
