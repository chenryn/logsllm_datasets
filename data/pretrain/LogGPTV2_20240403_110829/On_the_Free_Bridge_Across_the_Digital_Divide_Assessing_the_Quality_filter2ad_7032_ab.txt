MashAllah ElecTronics and Pharmaceutical
Guidelines are 15x-18x larger in the normal versions.
This difference can be attributed to high resolution images
and multiple JavaScript ﬁles in the paid version, while only
small images and no JavaScript are present in their Free Ba-
sics counterparts.
Further inspection of the services’ homepages reveals the
absence of any contextual and embedded advertisements in
the Free Basics version of the services. The lack of adver-
tisements is possibly due to the restriction on using JavaScript,
which is commonly used to fetch and display ads. This re-
striction raises the interesting question of economic incen-
tives of the web service providers, who might ﬁnd it difﬁcult
to monetize their services in Free Basics.
The technical speciﬁcations are put in place to support
the target population of mobile users in developing regions,
where mobile devices may not have full Web browsers and
must access the Internet via WAP or similar technologies [12].
However, the functional restrictions on Free Basics services
and their implications for the number of sites participating
(and the content they provide) require further investigation
and discussion. For example, determining whether the users
like the offered services, despite functional restrictions, will
require ﬁeld studies with Free Basics users.
Effect of walled garden: Free Basics offers a limited set
of services; accessing any Internet destination beyond that
set is not blocked but will incur charges, with appropriate
warnings shown to the user. To understand the impact of
this “walled garden” on the user, we approximated the size
of the “garden” by visiting every link from the homepage
of every Free Basics service to determine whether the result
was a warning page indicating that the visited link is outside
of Free Basics.
Figure 5(b) plots the CDF of the percentage of URLs linked
in the homepage of the Free Basics services in Pakistan that
are outside the Free Basics domain and give data warnings.
There are some services like Accuweather, BBC and ESPN
on the left, which are mostly self-contained. However, 60%
of the services have external links, which will cause breaks
in the user browsing experience.
In some cases, such as
VirtualpediatricHospital.org,
SumirBD.mobi, 80-90% of the listed URLs are external
links—rendering such services effectively useless.
An interesting example of this comes from the Bing search
engine, which is part of Free Basics in both South Africa
and Pakistan. Table 3 shows the result for ﬁve representative
searches in Pakistan, the number of results returned for each
search, and number of those results that are accessible using
Free Basics. The key take-away is that the vast majority of
Bing search results cannot be followed by Free Basics users
without incurring data charges.
Interestingly, we observe that it should be relatively easy
to modify search output to rank the results based on their
accessibility within Free Basics. This would improve the
user experience for all the queries in Table 3, as Free Ba-
sics has signiﬁcant number of services related to education,
news, health and job portals. This trade-off between offer-
ing a good user experience while keeping users restricted
within the walled garden vs. offering some tantalizing con-

tent out of reach of the free program to give users a glimpse
of the potential of the broader Internet, is open for debate.
Again, determining the merits of these approaches requires
ﬁeld studies.
3.3 Network performance
To measure the network service quality of Free Basics ser-
vices, we take three representative services in Pakistan - BBC,
Cricinfo and Mustakbil (a Pakistani job portal) and perform
the following experiment. We download the landing page of
each service and also all pages linked to this ﬁrst page. We
start this download simultaneously for the Free Basics ver-
sion of the service, and the normal mobile version with the
paid connection. We log the download time and the size for
each page, which are used for head-to-head comparison be-
tween these Free Basics services and their paid counterparts.
We do the same experiment for BBC Free Basics and BBC
paid versions in South Africa.
Page fetch speeds Figure 5(c) shows the CDF of network
speeds observed for the two versions of the same services.
The CDF is computed over 346 HTML pages of the Free
Basics version and 560 HTMLs of the normal version in
Pakistan and 155 HTML pages of Free Basics version and
166 HTMLs of normal version in South Africa.
We see a marked difference in the two speed distributions
in Pakistan, the median speed being 4 times slower for Free
Basics (80 Kbps), compared to the paid version of the same
service (320 Kbps). The curve for the paid services shows
a wide range of speeds typical of cellular broadband access,
and indicating that the provider has a capacity greater than
1Mbps. However, Free Basics downloads never experience
more than 128 Kbps, strongly suggesting that Free Basics
trafﬁc is throttled to a fraction of capacity.
The difference between the paid and free versions of BBC
in South Africa is less than that in Pakistan. Still, in South
Africa too, the free version never exceeds 600 Kbps, while
the paid version sees more than double those peak speeds. In
both Pakistan and South Africa, it is difﬁcult to attribute per-
formance differences to carrier-imposed throttling, proxy-
imposed throttling, or path inﬂation on the path that includes
the proxy. Isolating the source is part of our ongoing work.
Page fetch times Figure 6 shows the effect of download
speeds on user experience, the metric being page fetch times.
For the four services, we see a median increase of 2 to 6 sec-
onds in the page fetch times. The difference in page fetch
times is also service dependent, Cricinfo seeing the worst
delay followed by BBC and Mustakbil. This ordering fol-
lows the page size distribution of the services, where Free
Basics version of Cricinfo had the largest pages, followed
by BBC and Mustakbil. Thus services with richer content
will lead to a substantially worse user experience.
Figure 6: CDF of page fetch times by service
We tested whether different services within the same coun-
try saw differential service, and found no evidence of this
(i.e., Free Basics performance was neutral with respect to
service). Speciﬁcally, we compared performance between
downloads of similar-sized pages from different services (not
shown), and did not see any performance differences across
the services.
Effect of proxy Xu et al. [14] found that the relative network
locations of proxies between clients and servers can signif-
icantly impact performance. We ping the IP addresses con-

tacted for freebasics.com trafﬁc to understand their network
distance from clients. Interestingly, the reverse DNS name
for these IPs is a hostname ending with facebook.com or
fb.com (which veriﬁes the proxy based architecture in Fig-
ure 1 as documented by Facebook). We issue traceroutes and
use city codes in reverse DNS records for last-hop router IPs
to determine that the proxies we observed for Pakistan are in
Europe and those for South Africa are in the US.
Table 4 shows the ping latency from our client in Pakistan
to the proxy, and also to the servers hosting the normal ver-
sions of BBC, Cricinfo and Mustakbil. As seen from the
table, the delay to the Free Basics proxy is relatively high
(300 ms), largely due to the proxy being located in Europe
(about 5000 miles from the client in Pakistan). This delay
is six times larger than the delay to cricinfo.com, which is
hosted in Pakistan, and more than 50% higher than the la-
tency to bbc.com (likely hosted in Asia). Interestingly, the
delay to mustakbil is essentially the same as to the Free Ba-
sics proxy, likely indicating that the service is hosted in Eu-
rope. Similar differences in ping delays are seen in South
Africa, between the Free Basics proxy and the direct access
to bbc.com.
Taken together, the performance results indicate that Free
Basics users see poorer network performance to free sites
than to paid ones. Whether this performance is tolerable to
most users, and whether this is an acceptable price to pay for
free service, requires further investigation with user studies
and policy makers.
4. DISCUSSIONS & FUTURE WORK
This section further discusses the pros and cons of the Free
Basics design. We also outline our plans to scale our current
study and highlight some important aspects of Free Basics
that are beyond the scope of this paper, but merit attention in
future studies.
Is gate-keeping by proxy necessary? One of the widely de-
bated Free Basics design choices relates to the gate-keeper
role played by Facebook. Though we agree that the technical
speciﬁcations are well-justiﬁed (e.g., needed to make the ser-
vices accessible to resource-constrained feature-phone users),
it is unclear why these cannot be enforced by a basic transcod-
ing proxy that strips web services of excess functionality
(e.g., JavaScript) on the ﬂy to match the desired technical
speciﬁcations [10]. Such a design would alleviate the need
for individual web service operators to redesign their ser-
vices and separately request Facebook to approve their ser-
vices. From a user’s perspective, such a design would tear
down the wall around Free Basics services, make most tradi-
tional Internet services accessible, and signiﬁcantly improve
the user experience by limiting the number of broken (paid)
links, when browsing (see Section 3.2).
While the transcoding proxy described above has the po-
tential to open up the walled garden of Free Basics services,
it might raise incentive concerns for network service providers
(who might see a steep decline in the conversion rate of their
Free Basics users to paid users7).
Furthermore, the decision to have all Free Basics trafﬁc
transit via the proxy raises two important concerns. First,
as shown in Section 3.3, the proxies are often located (geo-
graphically) far from the Free Basics users and web servers,
contributing to increased round-trip times and page down-
load times for Free Basics users. Second, the proxy ser-
vice provider has access to all, mostly unencrypted, end-
user trafﬁc. As an example of some of the potential pri-
vacy risks, the URIs exposed to Free Basics revealed in-
formation such as user locations (e.g. from weather query
patterns in services like Accuweather) and political interests
(e.g.
from news browsing patterns in services like BBC).
As the proxy provider, Facebook states that they only in-
spect domain names and trafﬁc volumes, and that they (cu-
riously) store any cookies “in an encrypted and unreadable
format” [10].
Is Free Basics violating net neutrality? Many have raised
network neutrality concerns regarding Free Basics, most no-
tably in India [8, 9]. We found that in the two examples of
Free Basics deployments that we studied, trafﬁc for Free Ba-
sics received much worse performance than normal (paid)
Internet trafﬁc; however, all content within Free Basics re-
ceived the same performance. Whether this constitutes a net
neutrality violation is a matter of policy and is beyond the
scope of this work. Another aspect of Free Basics that im-
pacts net neutrality is differential pricing for content. In this
sense, Free Basics may provide participating zero-rated ser-
vices an advantage over those that do not participate. Under-
standing the implications of this on net neutrality is impor-
tant, but also outside the scope of this work.
Future work: Scaling our study We are currently working
towards scaling our QoS measurements of Free Basics along
different dimensions: (i) number of countries: we will re-
cruit volunteers to measure the QoS of Free Basics deploy-
7Facebook advertises the fact that nearly 50% of Free Basics
users convert to paid Internet users within the ﬁrst month of
Internet use as an incentive for network carriers to offer Free
Basics.
ments in more countries, (ii) number of locations in each
country: we are implementing an Android (mobile) app to
conduct measurements in the background, so our volunteers
can easily measure at various locations using only a phone,
(iii) across time: Free Basics deployments are still in their
infancy. We plan to monitor how the set of accessible web
services changes over the period of several months in sev-
eral countries, and (iv) across cellular technologies: in this
paper, we used high-end phones featuring the latest cellu-
lar technologies like LTE. A recent study [12] indicates that
the majority of phones in developing countries are feature
phones, supporting only older cellular technologies (3G, 2G,
and GSM). This motivates the need to characterize perfor-
mance for other cellular technologies and older devices.
Future work: Need for studies of Free Basics users The
scope of this paper is limited to characterizing available Free
Basics services and the performance for accessing them. Eval-
uating user satisfaction with Free Basics service choices,
their free access to those services, and the quality of net-
work performance they are given to access them, requires
focused ﬁeld studies. Such studies are orthogonal and com-
plementary to our focus. In particular, we hope that recent
efforts towards understanding the usage of zero-rated ser-
vices (where network service providers carry trafﬁc for spe-
ciﬁc Internet services for free and charge for others) would
be extended to cover Free Basics users as well [15].
