User: How to implement a highly available database cluster to ensure data stability and availability?
Assistant: 1. Database cluster architecture design Highly available database cluster architecture design includes at least master-slave replication, read-write separation, load balancing, failover and other modules. 2. Master-slave replication Master-slave replication refers to synchronizing the changes of the primary database to the standby database. The standby database synchronizes the data in the primary database in real time so that the data in the standby database is consistent with the primary database. When the primary database fails, the standby database can immediately Take over the service of the main library. 3. Read-write separation Read-write separation refers to the separate processing of reading and writing, the main database is used to write data, and the standby database is used to read data. Read-write separation can effectively reduce the load on the main library and improve the performance of the database server. 4. Load balancing Load balancing refers to distributing requests to different servers for processing, so that the load of each server is balanced and the requests are processed in a balanced manner. Through the implementation of load balancing, the throughput and concurrency of the database server can be improved, so as to better cope with high concurrent visits. 5. Failover Through the failover mechanism, the service can be automatically transferred to other nodes or servers when a failure occurs, thereby avoiding the stop of the entire database service caused by a single point of failure. 6. Database backup and recovery Database backup and recovery is an essential link in the reliability assurance project of large-scale database clusters, so that lost data can be recovered quickly in the event of data loss or server failure.
