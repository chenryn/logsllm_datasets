User: I have a fair number of smaller projects / libraries that I have been using over the past 2 years.  I am thinking about moving them to Google Code to make it easier to share with co-workers and easier to import them into new projects on my own environments.  The are things like a simple FSMs, CAN (Controller Area Network) drivers, and GPIB drivers.  Most of them are small (less than 500 lines), so it makes me wonder are these types of things too small for a stand alone open-source project?
Note that I would like to make it opensource because it does not give me, or my company, any real advantage.
Assistant: The smaller the better.
A 10 line function to convert HSV to RGB or find the closest point to a triangle or something like a CAN/GPIB driver is far more likely to be read and used than a massive complicated poorly documented framework
