### Description of Three Message Reception Cases

The following description is divided into three cases, based on the type of message received:

1. **When SP Receives ARM:**
   - The Service Provider (SP) registers the application in the application registration table and stores the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for each data source group.
   - The SP then transitions to the "ARM Received" status and initiates the data source lookup process.
   - After sending Data Link Request (DLR) messages for all required data sources, the SP transitions to the "Wait for DLR Response" state.
   - In this state, the SP expects to receive DLR response messages from other SPs.
   - If a receiving SP has the requested data source, it sends a success response back to the sender SP. Otherwise, it sends a failure response.
   - Based on the responses, the data link status is marked as available if at least one response is successful, and unavailable if all responses are failures.
   - The SP then transitions to the "QoS Managed" state to find the highest priority available data group to subscribe to.
   - To subscribe to the data sources, the SP sends a Data Link Establishment (DLE) request to the SPs corresponding to these data sources and awaits a DLE response.
   - The receiving SP adds the DLE request sender SP to the data source subscriber list and transitions to the "DLE Received" state.
   - If the data source is ready, the SP sends data to the SPs on the data subscriber list, and the link status is switched to "Online."

2. **When Receiving Data Over the Online Link:**
   - The SP sorts and buffers the incoming data.
   - It forwards the data to the application, applying down-sampling if required.
   - Simultaneously, QoS monitoring is performed.

3. **QoS Levels and Actions:**
   - **Normal QoS:** The QoS performance meets the application's requirements, and no additional action is needed.
   - **Low QoS Performance:** The QoS performance is close but does not meet the application's requirements.
     - The SP checks the availability of backup data groups.
     - If a backup data group is available, the SP sends a DLE request to the SPs providing that data group and updates the data link status based on the responses.
     - If no backup data group is available, the SP continues to search for suitable data groups.
     - Establishing a backup data link before the QoS performance fails can reduce the data group switching time.
   - **Failed QoS:** The link performance cannot meet the application's QoS requirements.
     - The SP checks the data link status of the backup data group.
     - If the backup data link is online, the SP switches the current data group to the backup and sends a switch data group message to the application.
     - If the backup data link is available, the SP sends a DLE request to the corresponding SPs.
     - In the worst case, when no backup data group is available, the SP continues to search until a suitable data group is found.

### Interaction Diagram of SDDS

The interaction diagram of the Stateful Data Delivery Service (SDDS) (Figure 3) illustrates the procedure for how an SP determines QoS performance issues and switches to another data source. It also shows the interactions between the SP, the application, and other SPs.

- **Blue Arrow Lines:** Represent Data A, which the application initially uses. This data is sent from other SPs to the main SP, buffered, and down-sampled before being forwarded to the application.
- **Yellow Arrow Lines:** Represent Data A with latency exceeding the threshold. The SP establishes a backup data link (Data B, represented by green arrow lines).
- **Green Arrow Lines:** Represent Data B, which is used as a backup. If the latency of Data A exceeds the requirement (red arrow line), the SP starts forwarding Data B to the application and sends a switch data notification to the application to use the appropriate algorithm for Data B.

### Case Study and Experiment

This section presents a case study implemented to validate the concept. The study involves a power system model with a Static Var Compensator (SVC) based Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller used for oscillation damping. The POD controller can use varying inputs, and the SDDS presented in Section III is implemented to provide the controller with the required data feeds. The results are presented at the end of this section.

#### Studied Power System Model

- **Power System Description:**
  - The studied power system is a two-area, four-machine system with the SVC deployed at Bus7.
  - Detailed system parameters can be found in [14].
  - No Power System Stabilizer is applied.
  - The voltage control function uses the SVC to control oscillations.
  - A three-phase to ground fault occurs on bus 8 at 100 seconds and is cleared after 0.2 seconds.

- **System Linearization:**
  - By linearizing the system at a normal operating point, the power system plant model can be represented in a standard state-space form:
    \[
    \begin{cases}
    \dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\
    y(t) = Cx(t)
    \end{cases}
    \]
  - Where \( x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \) is the state vector, \( u(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m \) is the input vector, and \( y(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p \) is the output vector.
  - \( n \), \( m \), and \( p \) represent the number of state, input, and output vectors, respectively.
  - \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), \( B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m} \), and \( C \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n} \) are the state, input, and output matrices, respectively.
  - The eigenvalues of \( A \) and the corresponding oscillation mode characteristics are presented in Table I.

#### SVC-Based POD Controller

- **Controller Function:**
  - The POD controller generates a control signal to the SVC voltage regulator block (Figure 5).
  - The POD controller includes gain, washout block, lead-lag block(s), and a limitation block (Figure 6).

- **Observability Analysis:**
  - To find candidate input signals for the POD controller, observability analysis is performed, and the results are given in Table II.
  - Power flow measurements from buses 7, 8, and 9 provide better observability than voltage amplitude from buses 6 and 10.

- **Controller Parameters:**
  - The parameters of the POD controller for each input signal are tuned and listed in Table III.
  - Not all lead-lag blocks in the POD controller are necessary. For example, when the input signal is power flow on bus 8, only one lead-lag block is used.
