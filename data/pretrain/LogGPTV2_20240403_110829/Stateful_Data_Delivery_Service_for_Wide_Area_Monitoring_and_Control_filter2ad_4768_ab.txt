The  following  description  is  divided  into  three  cases 
according  to  which  type  of  message  is  received. When  SP 
receives  ARM,  it  will  register  the  application  in  the 
application  registration  table  and  store  the  application  QoS 
requirements  of  each  data  source  group.  It  then  transits  to 
ARM  received  status  and  starts  data  source  lookup 
process.  After  sending  DLR  messages  for  all  data  sources 
required by the application, it transits to the next state, Wait 
for DLR response.  At  this  state,  the  SP  expects  to 
receive  DLR  response  message  from  other  SPs.  The 
receiving  SP  will  check  its  local  data  sources.  If  it  has  the 
requested data source, it will send a success response back to 
the  sender  SP  of  DLR.  Otherwise,  it  will  send  failure 
response to the sender SP. Based on the response, the status 
of the data links will be marked as available when one 
of  the  responses  is  success  and  unavailable  when  all 
response  are  failure.    The  SP  then  transits  to  the  QoS 
managed  state  to  find  the  highest  priority  available  data 
group  to  subscribe  to. To subscribe  to  the data  sources,  SP 
sends a DLE request to the SPs corresponding to these data 
sources. Then it awaits a DLE response message from these 
SPs. The receiving SP will add the DLE request sender SP 
into  the  data  source  subscriber  list  and  transit  to  DLE 
received  state.  If  the  data  source  is  ready,  this  SP  will 
send data to the SPs on the data subscriber list. Once the link 
is established, status of the link will be switched to Online. 
When  receiving  data  over  the  online  link,  the  SP  will 
sort,  and  put  data  into  the  incoming  data  buffer.  It  also 
forwards the data to the application, with down sampling if 
required.  At  the  same  time,  QoS  monitoring  is  performed. 
There are three QoS levels of the data link. Normal meaning 
that QoS performance fulfills the requirements of the specific 
application.  In  this  case,  no  additional  action  is  required. 
Low QoS Performance: QoS performance is close but does 
not violate the QoS requirements of the application. In such 
case, SP will check the availability of backup data groups. If 
there  is  a  backup  data  group  available,  SP  sends  a  DEL 
request to SPs providing that data group and change data link 
status according to the responses from these SPs. If there is 
no  available  backup  data  group,  SP  will  continue  trying  to 
find suitable data groups. To establish the backup data link 
before  the  QoS  performance  fails  to  fulfill  the  requirement 
can  help  reducing  the  data  group  switching  time. The  final 
state  Failed  QoS:  The  link  performance  cannot  fulfill  the 
QoS  requirements  of  the  application.  In  this  case,  SP  will 
check  the  data  link  status  of  the  backup  data  group.  If  the 
data link status is online, it will switch the present data group 
to backup data group and send switch data group message to 
the  application.  If  the  data  link  status  of  the  backup  data 
group  is  available,  it  will  send  DEL  request  to  the  SPs 
corresponding to those data sources. In the worst case when 
no backup data group is available. Then SP will keep finding 
backup  data  group  until  there  is  data  group  can  fulfill  the 
QoS performance.

Interaction Diagram of SDDS 
The  interaction  diagram  of  SDDS  (Figure  3)  illustrates 
the procedure of how an SP determines the QoS performance 
issue and switches to another data source. It also shows the 
interaction between SP, application and other SPs. 
Figure 3.  Interaction Diagram Statful Data Delivery Service. 
The  blue  arrow  lines  represent  the  Data  A  which  the 
application  is  using  from  the  beginning.  The  data  is  sent 
from other SP to main SP. By buffering and down sampling, 
the  data  is  forwarded  to  the  application.  The  yellow  arrow 
lines  represent  the  Data  A  which  latency  is  exceeding  the 
thread  then  SP  will  establish  the  backup  data  link  Data  B 
(represented by green arrow lines). Since the latency fulfills 
the requirement of application, Data A is still used. Once the 
Data A latency cannot fulfill the requirement (i.e. red arrow 
line),  SP  starts  forwarding  backup  data  (Data  B)  to  the 
application  and  send  a  switch  data  notification  to  the 
application to choose algorithm corresponding to Data B as 
input. 
IV. CASE STUDY AND EXPERIMENT
This section presents a short case study implemented to 
validate  the  concept.  The  study  involves  a  power  system 
model  with  a  Static  Var  Compensator  (SVC)  based  POD 
controller used for oscillation damping. The POD controller

can  use  varying  inputs  for  its  function,  and  the  SDDS 
presented above in Section III is implemented to provide the 
controller  with  data  feeds  as  requested.  The  results  are 
presented at the end of this section. 
A. Studied Power System Model 
The  studied  power  system  is  a  two-area  four-machine 
system  as  shown  in  the  figure  4.  The  SVC  is  deployed  at 
Bus7. The detailed system parameters can be found in [14]. 
There is no Power System Stabilizer applied in the system. 
The voltage control function uses the SVC shown in figure 5 
to control oscillations. A three-phase to ground fault occurs 
on bus 8 at 100 second and it is cleared after 0.2 second.

By linearizing the system at a normal operating point, the

Eigenvalue  No.1  has  a  negative  damping  ratio  which 
means  the  system  will  not  be  stable  due  to  power 
oscillations.  The  POD  controller  is  therefore  applied  to 
control  the  oscillations  with  the  SVC  compensating  the 
oscillations to improve system stability. 
B. SVC based POD Controller 
The POD controller generates a control signal to the SVC 
voltage  regulator  block  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  The  POD 
controller  includes  gain,  washout  block,  lead-lag  block(s) 
and limitation block as shown in Figure 6. 
Figure 5.  SVC voltage regulator diagram 
Figure 6.  POD controller block diagram. 
In  order  to  find  candidate  input  signals  to  the  POD 
controller, observability analysis is performed and the result 
is given in Table II. As is shown, in the table, found power 
flow  measurements  from  bus  7,  8,  and  9  provide  better 
observability than voltage amplitude from bus 6 and 10.

The parameter of the POD controller of each input signal 
is tuned and the parameters are listed in Table III. Although 
there are two led-lag blocks in the POD controller, it is not 
necessary to use both of them. For example, when the input 
signal is power flow on bus 8, only one led-lag block is used 
as shown in the table.
