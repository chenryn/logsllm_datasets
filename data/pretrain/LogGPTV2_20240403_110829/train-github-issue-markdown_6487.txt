When using FreeMarker's capability to use JSP taglibs in FreeMarker templates,
two of the Spring form tags, errors and option, do not render their output.
To reproduce, configure your SpringMVC application for FreeMarker views. The
standard documentation should help with this.
Then, in one of your FreeMarker templates, assign the Spring form taglibs and
try to use the errors or option tag:
Make sure a form validation error occurs for the value you submit. When the
page is displayed again, with the form errors, no error message is rendered at
all. By using the debugger, we see that the tag is doing the correct thing
(looking up the error message and outputting a span element with the resolved
message), but the output never makes it to the response. You see no error
message on the page.
We think that these two tags do not render because they extend
AbstractHtmlElementBodyTag and the TagWriter usage interacts poorly with
FreeMarker's TagTransformModel and Environment classes. Sorry for the lack of
a more explicit explanation, but essentially, the output writer that TagWriter
is constructed with gets swapped around by FreeMarker, so the output from the
tags never gets written to the response.
To solve this problem, one of our engineers came up with the solution to
extend ErrorsTag and OptionTag, overloading the renderDefaultContent() method
to call the base class method with a new TagWriter constructed with
pageContext.getOut(). I'll attach our fix.
