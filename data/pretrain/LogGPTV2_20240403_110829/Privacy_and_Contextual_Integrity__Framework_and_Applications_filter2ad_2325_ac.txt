tions are tracked using a standard PLTL construction called
the tableau [29]. The tableau of a PLTL formula is con-
structed by syntactically separating the present and future
requirements. The future requirements characterize the se-
quences of actions that complete a ﬁnite trace to a satisfying
inﬁnite trace.
Def. Given a ﬁnite past history σ, an action a weakly com-
plies with privacy policy θ if σ · a is a path in the tableau of
θ that starts at an initial θ-atom. The future requirements of
σ · a is the LTL formula ψ such that, for all traces σ(cid:2),
σ(cid:2) |= ψ if, and only if, σ · a · σ(cid:2) |= θ.
Weak compliance ensures that each action taken by agents
locally satisﬁes the privacy policy. However, a weakly com-
pliant action could incur unsatisﬁable future requirements.
Weak compliance can be decided (and future requirements
computed) using efﬁcient techniques from LTL run-time
veriﬁcation [35].
Theorem 3. Weak compliance and future requirements can
be computed in polynomial time.
In strong compliance, the information system ensures
that agents can actually meet their future requirements
while adhering to the policy. Note that previous privacy
languages, such as EPAL, are able to determine only weak
compliance because they lack a rich enough model of tem-
poral conditions to determine the satisﬁability of future re-
quirements.
Def. Given a ﬁnite past history σ, an action a strongly com-
plies with a privacy policy θ if there exists a trace σ(cid:2) such
that σ · a · σ(cid:2) |= θ.
Theorem 4. Strong compliance can be decided in PSPACE.
The complexity of checking strong compliance is in
PSPACE because it involves checking for satisﬁability.
However, because the typical use of this algorithm will be
at each point in a trace (for example in a hospital infor-
mation system), it is natural to ask whether it is possible
to reduce the complexity of checking whether each action
is compliant by doing more work at the beginning of the
execution. If weak compliance for a policy implies strong
compliance, an information system need only require weak
compliance (which can be computed efﬁciently) in order to
achieve strong compliance.
Theorem 5. Given a privacy policy θ, it can be decided
whether weak compliance for θ implies strong compliance
in exponential space.
The main idea behind the proof is to construct the au-
tomaton for θ and check that there is a path from every
reachable state to a strongly connected component.
5 Expressing Privacy Legislation
In this section, we exhibit the expressiveness of our for-
mal model of contextual integrity by showing how to repre-
sent some commonly discussed privacy legislation. We in-
tend our framework to express organizational privacy poli-
cies as well as legislation but focus on legislation in this
section for concreteness. We can capture most of the pri-
vacy notions embedded in the laws we examine, and con-
versely the laws we examine exercise most of the features
of our model. We regard this as evidence that CI has roughly
the correct level of expressiveness to represent generally ac-
cepted notions of privacy.
We consider three pieces of legislation: the Health In-
surance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and
the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA). The distinction be-
tween positive and negative norms surfaces in the differ-
ent approaches taken by these laws. At a high level,
HIPAA forbids disclosure of protected health information
except in certain enumerated capacities, whereas COPPA
and GLBA forbid certain enumerated information ﬂows.
Temporal conditions attached to negative norms are com-
mon in COPPA and GLBA. The mishandling of negative
temporal conditions in other frameworks hampers their abil-
ity to capture these privacy laws correctly, whereas CI is
able to capture both ﬂavors of policy in a uniﬁed logical
framework.
5.1 The HIPAA Privacy Rule
The HIPAA Privacy Rule regulates the transmission of
“protected health information” (phi), by covered entities,
such as hospitals, doctors, and insurance companies [31].
HIPAA largely forbids the disclosure of health information
except to individuals or organizations acting in certain roles.
HIPAA contains many privacy provisions, most of which
can be expressed directly as positive transmission norms.
We present a few representative examples in Fig. 2.
One norm (2) allows a covered entity to communicate
phi about an individual to that individual. This norm al-
lows Dr. Alice to show Bob an x-ray of his broken leg. It
does not allow, however, Dr. Alice to show Bob’s x-ray to
Charlie. Moreover, it does not permit x-ray technician Deb-
bie to give the x-ray to Dr. Alice. For that communication,
HIPAA provides another norm (3). Dr. Alice is not only a
covered entity, but more speciﬁcally a health care provider,
someone directly involved in the care of a patient. Here,
Debbie plays the role of covered entity and is permitted to
give Bob’s x-ray to Dr. Alice (Bob plays the role of patient).
Although the bulk of HIPAA consists of positive norms
dealing with the attribute phi, HIPAA does contain a nega-
tive norm dealing with a component of phi: psychotherapy

notes. The rule provides special protection for the disclo-
sure of psychotherapy notes, even to the individual whom
the notes are about. In particular, HIPAA contains a nega-
tive norm (4) that prevents a covered entity from disclosing
psychotherapy notes to the subject of the notes without the
prior approval of a psychiatrist.
The interplay between the positive and negative norms
is subtle. One positive norm (2) permits the disclosure of
psychotherapy notes, but a negative norm (4) prevents it
(unless approval is obtained). These norms are not con-
tradictory because the positive norm does not require the
disclosure. Moreover, even after approval is received (sat-
isfying the negative temporal condition), the covered entity
would not be allowed to disclose the notes without the pos-
itive norm.
HIPAA contains speciﬁc norms for directories of facili-
ties such as hospitals. Speciﬁcally, it provides that a cov-
ered entity may “disclose the individual’s [general] condi-
tion and location within the facility to anyone asking for the
individual by name” [31]. This can be expressed as the pos-
itive norm (5). The rule also contains a provision allowing
members of the clergy to obtain directory information. This
is expressed in norm (6), where directory-information is an
attribute that contains (formally can be used to compute)
the individual’s name, general condition, religious afﬁlia-
tion, and location within the facility. The use of such infor-
mation by the clergy is subject to further norms, but this is
outside the scope of HIPAA.
De-identiﬁed Health Information. Most of the HIPAA
privacy rule can be expressed using norms of transmission.
Some provisions, however, fall outside our model. In partic-
ular, HIPAA provides that covered entities can disclose “de-
identiﬁed health information” without regard to the other
provisions of the rule. In our formalization of contextual
integrity, every attribute is “identiﬁed” in virtue of being as-
sociated with an agent. Although we have not examined
this in detail, we expect that an extended model with group
attributes (attributes about a set of agents) could capture
de-identiﬁed attributes. The relation between individual at-
tributes and de-identiﬁed attributes has been studied exten-
sively (e.g., [3, 20, 40]).
5.2 Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Act (COPPA)
COPPA protects the personal information children com-
municate to web sites [22]. It differs from HIPAA in two
ways. First, COPPA does not contain an enumeration of
positive norms. Instead, it contains two negative norms that
restrict otherwise permissible ﬂows of information. Sec-
ond, temporal conditions play a central role in COPPA. The
temporal conditions require web sites who collect protected
information from children to respond in a certain way to
messages from parents.
COPPA applies when a child sends individually identiﬁ-
able information, protected-info, about him- or herself to a
web site operator over the Internet. The two central negative
norm of COPPA have a similar form, differing only in their
temporal conditions. Whenever a child sends a web site his
or her protected information, the web site operator is bound
to follow both temporal conditions, one requiring “parental
consent” and another providing a “right of access.”
The negative norm (7) requires web site operators to ob-
tain parental consent before collecting protected informa-
tion from children. When a child sends protected informa-
tion to a web site, a parent must have previously received a
privacy notice from the web site operator, granted consent
to the web site operator, and not since revoked that con-
sent. Notice the strong form of “since” is required here to
ensure that the parent actually granted consent. The neg-
ative norm (8) contains a temporal condition that requires
web site operators to furnish parents with a privacy notice
describing their information practices as well as the speciﬁc
information they have collected from the child. This reac-
tive condition is easily expressed using the
modality.

Figure 3. Norms of Transmission from COPPA
The ﬁrst temporal condition is concerned with the past,
that a parent has given consent, whereas the second condi-
tion is concerned with the future, that the web site operator
reacts correctly to parental requests. COPPA requires web
site operators to verify that they are indeed communicating
with one of the child’s parents before disclosing the child’s
protected information. Such veriﬁcation is represented in
our model by assigning the role parent to the appropriate
agents. COPPA also requires the operator to delete pro-
tected information in its possession upon receiving revoke-
consent. Our model does not capture “forgetting” actions,
but such actions can be included in the model, at the cost of
complexity.
5.3 Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA)
The Financial Modernization Act of 1999, commonly re-
ferred to as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act or GLBA, con-
tains privacy provisions limiting how ﬁnancial institutions
can handle the non-public personal information, npi, of their
customers and consumers [23]. Broadly, GLBA requires
ﬁnancial institutions to inform their customers of their pri-
vacy practices and to allow customers to “opt-out” of certain
kinds of information disclosures.
Financial institutions are required to send their cus-
tomers privacy notices every year as long the customer re-
lationship lasts. Without numerical notions of time, CI can
not express that the notices must be delivered annually. In-
stead, the negative norm (9) requires institutions to periodi-
cally send privacy notices.
In addition to a customer role, GLBA distinguishes a
consumer role. GLBA’s requirements on interacting with
consumers are less strict than its requirements on interact-
ing with customers. Institutions are required to notify con-
sumers of their privacy practices only if they share the con-
sumer’s npi with non-afﬁliated companies, and they may do
so before or after the disclosing npi. The negative norm (10)
makes essential use of the three different roles (sender, re-
cipient, and subject), as well as both past and future modal-
ities in its temporal condition.
Both consumers and customers can “opt-out” of the shar-
ing of npi with non-afﬁliated companies. The norm (11)
expresses the provision for consumers, and GLBA also con-
tains an analogous non-afﬁliate opt-out norm for customers.
Consumers and customers also have the option of opting out
of some kinds information sharing between institutions and
their afﬁliates, such the sharing of credit reports and appli-
cation information. The norm (12) expresses the provision,
and GLBA contains a similar norm for application informa-
tion. GLBA contains some exceptions to these norm, but
we omit those here for clarity.
Much of the consternation about GLBA revolves around
the complex deﬁnition of which companies are afﬁliates
and what precisely constitutes non-public personal infor-
mation [21]. Our formalization of these norms sidesteps
these issues by taking the role afﬁliate and the attribute npi
to be deﬁned exogenously: the judgments as to which com-
panies are afﬁliates and which communications contain npi
are made in the preparation of a trace history. The machin-
ery of the model then classiﬁes this trace history as respect-
ing or as not respecting the norms of transmission.
The use of negative norms in the expression of GLBA is
essential: replacing the negative norms with their positive
duals fails to express GLBA. Consider Alice, who is both
a customer and a consumer of ﬁnancial institution FirstCy-
ber. In the negative formulation of GLBA, if she sends npi
to FirstCyber, FirstCyber must periodically send her privacy
notices. In the attempted positive formulation, however, if
she sends npi to FirstCyber, FirstCyber need not periodi-
cally send her privacy notices. The disjunctive character
of positive norms enables FirstCyber to choose, for each
communication, whether to regard Alice as a customer or
as a consumer. In the negative formulation, the conjunctive
character of the negative norms requires FirstCyber to treat
Alice as both a customer and a consumer.

trol Markup Language (XACML), the Enterprise Privacy
Authorization Language (EPAL), and the Platform for Pri-
vacy Preferences (P3P). CI generalizes these existing mod-
els in two key ways. First, CI includes an extensive lan-
guage for deﬁning temporal conditions, improving the rudi-
mentary future “obligations” of XACML and EPAL. Sec-
ond, CI correctly handles temporal conditions associated
with negative norms (denying rules). Temporal conditions
can be attached to denying rules in XACML and EPAL, but
the resulting semantics are murky. Our ﬁndings are summa-
rized in Figure 5.
6.1 Role-Based Access Control
Role-Based Access Control (e.g., [12]) is an access con-
