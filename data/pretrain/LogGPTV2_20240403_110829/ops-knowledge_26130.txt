User: Is there a python library for oAuth which can be run on Window and Linux?
On window I am using python-oauth but I could not find an installation for Linux
Assistant: All Python libraries that don't rely on native code or platform-specific APIs are portable. I don't see any of that in python-oauth or python-oauth2.
So your current library should work fine on Linux.
