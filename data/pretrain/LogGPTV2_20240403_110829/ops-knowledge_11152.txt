User: Please analyze the security issues of database password storage, and propose strengthening measures and specifications.
Assistant: The security issues of database password storage include the following aspects: 1. Plain text storage: Passwords are directly stored in the database in plain text. Once the database is leaked, attackers can easily obtain the password. Therefore, passwords must be encrypted for safe storage. 2. Insecure encryption algorithm: If the encryption algorithm used is not secure enough, the attacker can crack the password through brute force or other methods. Therefore, a safe and reliable encryption algorithm must be selected, such as SHA-2, SHA-3, bcrypt, etc. 3. Weak password problem: If a user uses a weak password, an attacker can easily crack the password. It is recommended that users set complex and difficult-to-guess passwords, and set a password expiration period. 4. Improper database access authorization: If the user's database access authority is too large, the attacker may obtain the user's password through injection or other means. Therefore, the principle of least privilege must be enforced to limit user access. Strengthening measures and norms: 1. Use firewalls, IDS and other security devices to protect the database. 2. Deploy the database and the application separately, and restrict the database from being directly accessed. 3. Securely encrypt database passwords and strictly control access rights. 4. Change passwords regularly, and set security policies such as password length and complexity. 5. One-way encryption is performed on the password, and techniques such as password hashing and salting are used to improve password security. 6. Strengthen database security audit and monitoring to discover security loopholes in time. 7. Educate and train users on password security awareness, avoid using weak passwords, and do not save passwords in browsers or spreadsheets. 8. Regularly carry out security test assessments for key databases to enhance database security.
