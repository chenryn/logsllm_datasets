User: How to use the Git version control system to manage source code and documentation in the software development process?
Assistant: The Git version control system is a distributed version control system that can help developers manage code and document versions, collaborate on development, record change history, and more. The following are the basic steps of how to use Git to manage source code and documents in the software development process: 1. Install Git: First, you need to install the Git version control system on the development machine. You can download the installation package from the Git official website for installation. 2. Create a Git repository: Create a Git repository on the development machine to manage source code and documentation. A Git repository can be initialized with the Git command git init. 3. Add files: Add the code and documents that need to be managed to the Git warehouse, and you can use the git add command to add files. 4. Submit the change: use the git commit command to submit the change to the Git repository, and record the author, date and other information of the change. 5. Synchronize warehouse: During collaborative development, it is necessary to synchronize changes in the Git warehouse. You can use the git pull command to pull the latest version locally, and use the git push command to push local changes to the warehouse. 6. Create branches: During the development process, branches can be created for the development of different functions. You can use the git branch command to create a new branch and use the git checkout command to switch branches. 7. Merge branches: When the branch development is completed, the branches need to be merged. You can use the git merge command to merge code from different branches together. 8. Dealing with conflicts: When there are conflicts in the codes of different branches, they need to be resolved manually. You can use the git diff command to view the differences between different branches. The above are the basic steps for the Git version control system to manage source code and documents in the software development process. When using Git, it is necessary to pay attention to the reasonable use of branches and submission information, and to ensure the collaboration and communication between team members.
