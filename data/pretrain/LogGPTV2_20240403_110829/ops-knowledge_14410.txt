User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can't access network path of localhost specified with a host I use Windows.

Using Run window, I type \\127.0.0.1 and enter. Viola, a window appears that shows my shared folder, a network view of my PC.

Now I add a simple DNS entry to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file, to give the 127.0.0.1 a name.

127.0.0.1     storage


Now again using Run window, I type \\storage. This time however Windows asks for credentials (username/password).

I'm using Microsoft Account to log into my Windows machine. Why using a name to access local host triggers credentials, while it's mapped to localhost IP?

Assistant: First ask
In Windows OS protected \etc\hosts dir.

Solution;


copy \etc\hosts to a spesific dir,
remove \etc\hosts, 
change copied hosts file, 
and recopy \etc\hosts file.


Second question

do yo setup any webserver?
