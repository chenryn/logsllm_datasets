### Benefits of Measuring Authentication Schemes

We identified 11 benefits for security, 6 for deployability, and 8 for usability in authentication schemes. These metrics align with the recommendations by Stajano [27] for token-based authentication. Table I provides a summary of the benefits each scheme offers in these categories.

Users can employ various types of authenticators, such as USB tokens, TPMs, and smartphones. To apply the framework by Bonneau et al. [1], we considered that some benefits are specific to the FIDO2 standard, while others depend on the design of the authenticator device. This distinction is important because users primarily interact with the authenticator, not the underlying protocols.

When applying the framework by Bonneau et al. [1], we explicitly differentiate between benefits derived directly from the FIDO2 protocols (which are consistent across all authenticators, marked in Table I) and those dependent on the specific authenticator, such as the Yubico Security Key used in our study (not marked in Table I). The benefits may vary if another authenticator, like a smartphone or Apple’s TouchID, is used. A detailed explanation of our evaluation of FIDO2 is provided in Appendix A.

**Summary:**
FIDO2 with a Yubico Security Key as an authenticator scores almost perfectly in the Bonneau et al. [1] framework, missing only the following benefits: Nothing-to-Carry, Easy-Recovery-from-Lost, Server-Compatible, and Resilience-to-Theft. No existing alternative to text-based passwords offers as many benefits in Bonneau's framework as FIDO2 with single-factor authentication. While this makes FIDO2 a strong candidate to replace text-based passwords, our study explores additional factors that might affect user acceptance.

### Related Work

#### A. Single-Factor Authentication

Replacing text-based passwords with alternatives is an active research area. For a comprehensive overview, we refer readers to the related work sections by Bonneau et al. [1] and Stajano [27]. We focus on studies conceptually close to FIDO2 or widely deployed.

- **Pico by Stajano [27]:** Pico proposes using a hardware token to replace passwords, sharing many design aspects with U2F and FIDO2. It uses a challenge-response protocol based on public key cryptography, offers mutual authentication, and considers user privacy. A field study [28] with 11 users showed positive feedback, but highlighted concerns about recovery and remote blocking.
  
- **TLS Client Certificates [29]:** Current implementations have poor user experience and allow services to track users. FIDO2 avoids these privacy risks and provides a simpler, less error-prone, and more consistent user experience.

- **Let’s Authenticate by Conners and Zappala [31]:** This solution uses client certificates managed with an authenticator, offering features like automatic account registration/login and privacy protection. However, it relies on a CA for issuing client credentials, unlike the decentralized nature of FIDO2.

#### B. Two-Factor Authentication

The usability and acceptability of two-factor authentication (2FA) with different second factors, such as OTP tokens, SMS, push messages, and U2F Security Keys, have been studied extensively. We focus on the most relevant works for our study of FIDO2 authentication with security keys for passwordless authentication.

- **General 2FA Studies:**
  - **Strouble et al. [32], Weir et al. [33], Gunson et al. [35], Krol et al. [36], De Christofaro et al. [37]:** These studies show that users find specialized hardware burdensome, lose the hardware, and prioritize convenience over perceived security.
  - **Fagan and Khan [38]:** Users often avoid 2FA due to inconvenience and cost.

- **U2F Security Keys:**
  - **Lang et al. [25]:** Google's deployment of U2F security keys to 50,000 employees showed ease of use and deployment, though no formal user study was conducted.
  - **Das et al. [26], [39]:** A two-phase study found that clearer setup instructions improved usability but did not change overall acceptability. Concerns about losing the key and account recovery were significant.
  - **Reynolds et al. [40]:** Two usability studies of YubiKey as a second factor revealed initial setup difficulties but high usability in daily use. Windows 10 support issues were noted.
  - **Reese et al. [43]:** Comparative studies of five 2FA methods showed that users generally find them usable, but availability of the second factor can be a concern.
  - **Ciolino et al. [44]:** Setup process for U2F authenticators was found to be inconvenient due to lack of instructions and guidance. Form factor and device compatibility were also concerns.
  - **Das et al. [41]:** User experience with older adults (>60 years) indicated that non-inclusive design and inadequate risk communication led to minimal adoption.

### Research Questions

Our study aimed to answer the following research questions:
1. How do users perceive FIDO2 passwordless authentication in terms of usability?
2. Are users accepting FIDO2 passwordless authentication?
3. What thoughts and concerns arise in users' minds when using FIDO2 passwordless authentication?

To address these questions, we compared FIDO2 passwordless authentication with traditional password-based authentication. Based on prior research, we developed the following hypotheses:

- **H1:** FIDO2 passwordless authentication has higher usability than traditional password-based authentication.
- **H2:** FIDO2 passwordless authentication and traditional password-based methods differ in their acceptance.

**Control Variables:**
- **Usability:** A key predictor of technology usage and acceptance.
- **Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI):** People with high ATI may enjoy and accept new technologies more.
- **Privacy Concerns:** New authentication technologies like FIDO2 involve private information.
- **Computer Science Background:** Prior education in computer science can influence perceptions of authentication methods.

### Methodology

Our study examined users' perceptions, acceptance, and thoughts about FIDO2 passwordless authentication with a security key, compared to traditional password-based authentication. We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches.

#### A. Study Design and Procedure

We employed a between-group research design, inviting participants to interact with the registration and authentication processes of web applications in a controlled laboratory environment.

- **Group1FA (FIDO2):** Participants used a self-generated username and a Yubico Security Key.
- **GroupPass (Password):** Participants created a username and password, with a minimum length of 8 characters.

**Study Stages:**

1. **Welcome Message:** Introduction and study instructions.
2. **Topic Introduction Video:** A 3-minute video introducing "authentication security" and common problems.
3. **FIDO2-Specific Information (Group1FA Only):** A 2-minute video explaining FIDO2, its benefits, and drawbacks.
4. **Attention Check Questions (Group1FA Only):** Four questions to ensure understanding.
5. **Setup Video (Group1FA Only):** A 3.5-minute video guiding the setup process.
6. **Hands-On Task:**
   - **Group1FA:** Register and log in using a Yubico Security Key on mockup websites "Schmoogle" and "Fakebook."
   - **GroupPass:** Register and log in using text-based passwords.
7. **Survey:** Participants completed a questionnaire covering demographics, privacy concerns, usability, ATI, and other relevant variables.

The introduction and setup videos, along with the workflows for the mockup websites, are available at [56].

### Conclusion

This study aims to provide insights into the usability and acceptance of FIDO2 passwordless authentication, addressing potential concerns and barriers to adoption. By comparing FIDO2 with traditional password-based authentication, we seek to understand the factors that influence user perception and acceptance.
