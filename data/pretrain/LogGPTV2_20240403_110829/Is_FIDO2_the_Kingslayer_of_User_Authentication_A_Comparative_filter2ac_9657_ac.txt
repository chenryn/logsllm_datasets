("beneﬁts") for measuring the security (11 beneﬁts), deploya-
bility (6), and usability (8) of authentication schemes, which
also pick up prior recommendations by Stajano [27] for token-
based authentication. Table I summarizes the comparison of
beneﬁts that each scheme provides in those categories. As
mentioned before, a user could use various types of authen-
ticators, such as USB token, TPM, smartphone, etc. Thus, to
apply the framework by Bonneau et al. [1], we had to consider
that there are some beneﬁts that only depend on the FIDO2
standard and beneﬁts that are only dependent on the speciﬁc
design of the authenticator device. This is motivated by the fact
that the user primarily has to handle the authenticator, while
not being directly concerned with the underlying protocols.
Hence, when we apply the framework by Bonneau et al. [1],
we make this explicit distinction between beneﬁts that are
derived directly from the FIDO2 protocols and are ﬁxed for
background in
all types of authenticators (marked with
Table I), and beneﬁts that are mostly or purely dependent
on the authenticator, here, the Yubico Security Key that we
used in our study (no background color in Table I). Thus,
those beneﬁts might look different if we would use another
authenticator, like a smartphone or Apple’s TouchID. Here,
we only give a summary of our evaluation of FIDO2, a more
detailed explanation can be found in Appendix A.
Summary: FIDO2 with a Yubico Security Key as an authen-
ticator scores almost perfectly in the framework by Bonneau et
al. [1], missing Nothing-to-Carry, Easy-Recovery-from-Loss,
Server-Compatible, and Resilience-to-Theft. In fact, none of
the existing alternatives to text-based passwords offers as many
beneﬁts in Bonneau’s et al. framework as FIDO2 with single
factor authentication. While this seemingly makes FIDO2 a
very strong candidate to replace text-based passwords, we are
interested in our study in reasons beyond those 25 factors that
might affect the acceptance of FIDO2 by users.
III. RELATED WORK
We review prior works on the usability and acceptability of
single-factor and two-factor authentication schemes.
A. Related studies of single-factor authentication
Replacing text-based passwords with alternatives is a very
active research area and because of space constraints we refer
to the excellent related work sections by Bonneau et al. [1] and
Stajano [27] for a more comprehensive overview. We focus in
the following on selected works that are either conceptually
closer to FIDO2 or found widespread deployment.
Stajano [27] proposed Pico for replacing passwords with a
hardware token, which shares many design aspects with U2F
and FIDO2. For instance, it is based on a challenge-response
protocol based on public key cryptography, offers mutual
authentication between Pico and the veriﬁer, and considers
the user’s privacy (e.g., no tracking). In an evaluation of
Pico’s usability in the wild [28], users appreciated avoiding
passwords. Although this ﬁeld study only had 11 users, this
can be seen as encouraging for the acceptance of FIDO2.
Additional user concerns were recovery in case of device loss
and blocking Pico remotely.
TLS client certiﬁcates [29] can be used for online au-
thentication. However, Parsovs [30] pointed out that current
implementations have a poor user experience and that client
certiﬁcates allow services to track users. The implementation
of FIDO2 avoids those privacy risks and its implementation in
browsers is tailored to providing a simpler, less error-prone,
and more consistent user experience.
Very recently, Conners and Zappala [31] proposed a
certiﬁcate-based authentication where client certiﬁcates are
managed with an authenticator. Their Let’s Authenticate so-
lution provides appealing features, such as automatic account
registration/login, easier account recovery, and privacy protec-
tion, but builds on top of a CA that issues client credentials
to users in contrast to the decentralized nature of FIDO2.

B. Related studies of two-factor authentication
The usability and acceptability of two-factor authentication
with different forms of second factors, such as OTP tokens,
SMS, push messages, or most recently U2F Security Keys,
has been studied in different works. Here, we focus on the
most relevant works to our study of FIDO2 authentication with
security keys for passwordless authentication.
1) General two-factor authentication: Two-factor authen-
tication solutions for web services have been studied, for
instance, by Strouble et al. [32], Weir et al. [33], [34],
Gunson et al. [35], Krol et al. [36], or De Christofaro et
al. [37]. Generally,
their results showed that users found
specialized hardware for authentication burdensome, that users
lose said hardware, and that convenience is more important
than perceived usability and security for users’ willingness to
adopt a new authentication technology. Fagan and Khan [38]
studied the general motivation of users to (not) follow common
computer security advice, including the advice to use two-
factor authentication. They also conclude that users abstain
from two-factor authentication to avoid inconvenience and
cost. In our study, we are interested in concerns that would
impede adoption of FIDO2 single-factor authentication.
2) Acceptability and usability of 2FA with Security Keys:
Usability and convenience have been key design factors for
U2F security keys, such as the Yubico Security Key. Recent
studies [25], [26], [39], [40], [41] have focused on the accept-
ability and usability of U2F security keys and are closest and
most informative to our study.
Lang et al. [25] report about the two year experience by
Google for deploying U2F security keys to more than 50,000
of their employees. Their results showed that security keys are
easy to deploy and refer to their use as “brainless” in compari-
son to OTP-based two-factor authentication. However, they did
not conduct any user study but rely on user feedback and logs
(e.g., authentication attempts or time spent authenticating).
Das et al. [26], [39] conducted a two-phase study and asked
their participants to setup a U2F Yubico Security Key as
second factor for their GMail accounts. Their results showed
that clearer setup instructions led to signiﬁcant improvements
in usability, but did not change the overall acceptability of
the solution. A major constraint on the acceptability was the
concern about loss of the key, where concern about being
locked out of the account was more salient than losing access
to an attacker. Many of the participants were also confused
about how to recover their account in case their key is lost.
Their results highlight that the acceptance of the solution does
not depend solely on convenience and usability.
Reynolds et al. [40] describe two usability studies of Yubico
YubiKey as second factor: setup and day-to-day usage. In the
ﬁrst study, 31 participants were asked to setup and conﬁg-
ure the YubiKey for a Windows 10, Google, and Facebook
account. The result of the ﬁrst study revealed that most
participants struggled to setup their accounts with 2FA in
general and Yubikey in particular. In a follow-up study, 25
participants were asked to use a Yubikey in their daily lives for
a four-week period. In contrast to the ﬁrst study, participants
in the second study reported that the Yubikey is usable in
day-to-day usage and gave a high SUS [42] score. However,
in both studies, participants had consistent problems with
using the YubiKey on Windows 10, which also affected our
decision to focus on web authentication with two mockup
websites instead of using Windows 10, currently being the
only platform supporting FIDO2 single-factor authentication.
Moreover, FIDO2 has been integrated into browser software
and platform support exists, which removes many of the prob-
lems the participants in Reynolds’ et al. study encountered.
Reynolds et al. further recommend to standardize the setup
process to improve usability of this crucial step. In our study,
we improved the setup part by showing a short video to
our participants and explaining step by step how to log into
accounts using a Yubico Security Key.
Reese et al. [43] conducted comparative usability studies of
the usage and setup of ﬁve two-factor authentication methods:
SMS, push notiﬁcations, TOTP, U2F with Security Key, and
printed out codes. The goal was to eliminate confounding
factors and provide better comparison of these methods. Their
results show that users generally ﬁnd all ﬁve different methods
usable and the majority of participants considers the extra
effort worth the gain in security. A third of their participants,
however, noted that they do not always have their second factor
available, causing inconveniences.
Ciolino et al. [44] conducted a comparative lab study of the
setup process of three different U2F authenticator devices and
SMS OTP as well as a diary study on the continued use of
one such authenticator. Their results underline that the setup of
security keys is a high inconvenience for users due to lacking
instructions and guidance, and that particular user interface
design choices of the web services or by the vendor of the
authenticator contribute to this problem. Their participants also
expressed concerns about the form factor of the authenticator,
e.g., easier losing smaller devices, breaking larger devices, or
recognizing buttons as such.
Das et al. [41] investigated the user experience of Security
Keys with ten older adults (>60 years) and found that non-
inclusive design and inadequate risk communication resulted
in minimal adoption in their participant pool. In particular,
the form factor of the authenticator device (e.g., too small to
be handled easily in daily use) and device compatibility were
found to be crucial. Our results indicate that the form factor of
the authenticator and the applicability of FIDO2 authentication
are of general concern.
IV. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
It was our goal to answer the following research questions:
1) How do users perceive FIDO2 passwordless authentica-
tion in terms of usability?
2) Are users accepting FIDO2 passwordless authentication?
3) What thoughts and concerns arise in the users’ minds
when using FIDO2 passwordless authentication?
To do so, our user study compared passwordless authentica-
tion against traditional password-based authentication. In the

following section, we develop concrete hypotheses based on
prior research ﬁndings.
Usability is determined by the users’ perception of how well
a technology is suited to effectively, efﬁciently, and satisfacto-
rily achieve their goals. Passwords as the default authentication
method on the web can already cover many points concern-
ing usability [1]. However, the two aspects of usability that
text-based passwords cannot satisfy —Memorywise-Effortless
and Scalable-for-Users—are particularly important, as average
users nowadays have a large number of online accounts [45],
[46]. FIDO2 passwordless authentication fulﬁlls these two
important requirements and also has the advantage that it is
Physically-Effortless. Subsequently, we assume that:
H1: FIDO2 passwordless authentication has a higher
usability than traditional password-based authentication.
The user acceptance for a (technological) system [47] de-
scribes factors that, according to the Technology Acceptance
Model [48], are direct precursors of the actual usage of
a technology in the future. This makes acceptance particu-
larly important if passwordless authentication aims to replace
passwords in the long run. The perceived convenience and
usefulness of passwordless authentication could lead to a very
high acceptance of this technology. On the other hand, users
have been accustomed to using passwords for a long time and
this extensive previous experience should also lead to a high
acceptance of this technology [49]. Since it is not clear which
of the two authentication methods should be accepted more,
we assume that there are differences:
H2: FIDO2 passwordless authentication and the tradi-
tional password-based method differ in their acceptance.
Control variables: Prior research has identiﬁed several situa-
tional and user-speciﬁc variables that may also inﬂuence users’
acceptance. Therefore, we include the following variables in
our experimental design to control for their effects: (1) Us-
ability, is one of the most important predictors of technology
usage and acceptance [48] and depends heavily on users’ pref-
erences and prior experiences [49]. We therefore assume that
usability may have an effect on acceptance regardless of the
authentication method. (2) Afﬁnity for technology interaction
(ATI) describes a person’s tendency to enjoy and proactively
engage in technology interaction [50], [51]. People with a
high ATI should have more fun using a new authentication
method and therefore accept it more. (3) Privacy concerns
describe users’ concerns that can arise if it is not clear what
will happen to one’s own data [52]. As new authentication
technologies, such as FIDO2, are by their very deﬁnition re-
lated to private information, we controlled for users’ individual
privacy concerns. (4) A Computer science background—for
example, a corresponding degree or course of studies—imparts
technical basics and weaknesses of established authentication
methods. In order to exclude an effect of this prior education
we controlled for such a background.
V. METHODOLOGY
The core idea of our study was to look at the perception,
acceptance, and thoughts of users about FIDO2 passwordless
authentication with a security key and compare these to
traditional password-based authentication. Thereby, we used
a combination of both quantitative and qualitative approaches
that are described in more detail in this section.
A. Study design and procedure
In our user study we used a between-group research design
and invited participants to interact with the registration and
authentication process of web applications in a controlled
(laboratory) environment to gain hands-on experience.
We explicitly decided to let each participant try only one
of the two authentication methods in order to avoid that the
participants focus mainly on the differences between both
schemes. Corresponding contrast effects [53] that could occur
in a within-person design might have introduced signiﬁcant
bias into the qualitative analysis of participants’ thoughts and
concerns. Therefore, we randomly assigned our participants
to a study (referred to as Group1FA) and a control group
(GroupPass), which differed only in the authentication method
available to the participants during this hands-on experience.
Members of Group1FA could log in with a self-generated
user name and a security key. Thereby, we focused on the
Yubico Security Key as the authentication device because it is
the most popular end-user security key on the market and has
already been the subject of studies in the past [40], [26], [25].
Members of GroupPass had to create a password in addition
to a user name during registration. Thereby, the only password
policy in place was a restriction to a minimum length of 8
characters, which corresponds to the lowest possible hurdle
according to the NIST password guidelines [54].
At the beginning of the study, participants read the privacy
policies and gave their consent. Afterwards, the participants
were led to a workplace with a laptop and (in Group1FA) a
Yubico Security Key. The study consisted of a survey with
seven stages that guided participants through the entire process
in a standardized form (see Figure 2):
Stage 1 (welcome message): the study began with a
welcome message, including the study instructions.
Stage 2 (topic introduction): Participants watched a video
(≈3 min) introducing the topic of the study—"authentication
security." From the perspective of Alice (a ﬁctitious character),
common problems associated with the registration and use of
online services were presented. Alice’ story focused on the
theft and abuse of account credentials and how to protect
against those threats. This video was designed to balance
different levels of prior knowledge between our participants.
The next three stages (stages 3, 4 and 5) were only com-
pleted by the Group1FA, while the participants in GroupPass
were redirected straight to stage 6.
Stage 3 (FIDO2-speciﬁc information): Prior work has
shown that lack of clarity about the functionality and security
beneﬁts of authentication methods leads to lower security
ratings, lower acceptance, and reluctance to switch to a new
authentication method [34], [33], [55], [26]. FIDO2 is very
likely unknown to the users, so we decided to give our

Fig. 2: Overview of our study procedure
participants an introduction to this new technology in order
to examine the informed decisions and opinions of users
without bias generated by a potential
lack of knowledge.
Corresponding information was provided to our participants
as another video (≈2 min), as it was suggested from users’
side in related work [40]. This video dealt with the practical
use of a Yubico Security Key for single-factor authentication,
its known beneﬁts and drawbacks, and is seamlessly integrated
into the introduction video and the story-line of Alice.1
Stage 4 (attention check question): Four attention test
questions were used to determine if the participants understood
the information from the previous stage correctly. None of our
participants failed this check.
Stage 5 (setup video:) Afterwards,
the participants in
Group1FA were provided with a setup video (≈3:30 minutes)
that explained the setup process for FIDO2 with a Yubico
Security Key. The content of the video was a step by step
guide through the registration and authentication process using
the Yubico Security Key on a demo site that supports FIDO2.
Stage 6 (hands-on task): The participants of both groups
received a ﬁrst-hand experience with their corresponding
authentication method. The participants were asked to con-
ﬁgure an account on two mockup websites, "Schmoogle"
and "Fakebook," which were strongly inspired by the social
media service Facebook and the email provider GMail to
provide a realistic scenario. These two websites were chosen
because we assumed that their structure, design, and the way
of interaction with them is known to many users. This was
especially important as we were not interested in the user
interaction with the service as a whole, but especially in
the perception of the registration and authentication process.
Additionally, there were several reasons why we decided to
use mockup websites and not real web services: 1) At the
time we designed this study there was no web service that
used FIDO2 in passwordless mode; 2) Even though Microsoft
is promoting passwordless authentication with FIDO2 for its
services [19], [5], a PIN or biometrics is still required to
unlock the authenticator, which users may mistake as text-
based password or device-local authentication. Moreover, prior
works encountered poor user experiences of Windows’ support
for security keys [40], which we wanted to avoid in our study;
3) We aimed for a controllable and standardized environment,
1In practice, most websites do not offer such detailed user guidance for new
authentication technologies. In Section VI-E, we therefore conduct a "reality
check" of our introduction approach to ensure the stability of our results.
with no risk that our results might be affected by changes in
the login process or the user interface of the web service. As
a task in GroupPass the participants had to register and log-
in to the websites using text-based passwords. Group1FA had
to use the Yubico Security Key to register and authenticate.
There was no time limit and participants could try and explore
the methods as long as they wanted. For the implementation
of our mockup websites for Group1FA, we used the FIDO2
example projects [23], [24] by Adam Powers. We removed
the password ﬁelds from registration/login forms. Instead, the
registration/login button triggers the WebAuthn API. The in-
troduction and setup videos as well as videos of the workﬂows
for our websites can be found at [56]. Our participants used
the Chrome browser for this task.
Stage 7 (survey): After completing the practical task, par-
ticipants completed the questionnaire with our study variables,
