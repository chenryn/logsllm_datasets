**ATT&CK ID:** M1047  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Audit

**Description:**
Conduct a thorough audit to identify and remediate unnecessary existing authentication certificates, as well as common misconfigurations in Certificate Authority (CA) settings and permissions. This includes reviewing and adjusting Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificate enrollment permissions and ensuring that overly permissive certificate templates are not published. Overly permissive templates can allow for the creation of certificates with potentially dangerous settings.

**Steps:**

1. **Review Existing Certificates:**
   - Use the Certificate Authority Management Console (certsrv.msc) to check the available AD CS certificate templates.
   - Identify and remove any unneeded or outdated certificates.

2. **Examine CA Settings and Permissions:**
   - Ensure that AD CS certificate enrollment permissions are appropriately configured to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Verify that only authorized users and groups have the necessary permissions to enroll for certificates.

3. **Check for Overly Permissive Templates:**
   - Review the settings defined in the certificate templates to ensure they do not allow for the creation of certificates with excessive privileges.
   - Modify or remove any templates that are too permissive.

4. **Utilize Tools for Detailed Analysis:**
   - Use `certutil.exe` to examine detailed information within the AD CS CA database. This tool can provide insights into the current state of the CA and help in identifying potential misconfigurations.
