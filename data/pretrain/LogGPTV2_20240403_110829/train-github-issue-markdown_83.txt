Hello,  
My issue is about lowpass generated in sos form
    >>> print(signal.butter(2, 1, 'low', analog=True, output = "sos"))
    >>> print(signal.butter(2, 1, 'high', analog=True, output = "sos"))
    [[1.         0.         0.         1.         1.41421356 1.        ]]
    [[1.         0.         0.         1.         1.41421356 1.        ]]
As you can see generating a lowpass and a highpass gives the same
coefficients.  
Same issue with the cheby1 filter type.  
Like the sos configuration doesn't like to see b2 = 0  
Cheers,
