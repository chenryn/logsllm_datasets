### 5. Experimental Results on KAD

To demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB-Probe, we present the results obtained from over 1300 ADSL hosts participating in the Kademlia DHT [9], which is used by applications like eMule. We utilized the KAD crawler from [12] to gather the IP addresses of these hosts and then filtered them using the Maxmind database to include only those connected through an ADSL service provider. Two distinct experiments were conducted: one aimed at analyzing a wide variety of hosts at a specific point in time to generate a snapshot of the available bandwidth (avail-bw) distribution, and another focused on measuring a particular subset of hosts over a period of more than 10 days.

#### 5.1 A Snapshot of the Avail-bw Distribution

We measured 1244 hosts from various ISPs in the US and Europe, examining both capacity and avail-bw (though the discussion on capacity is omitted; see [1] for details). The average duration for each avail-bw measurement was less than 6 seconds per host. Figure 2(a) illustrates the downlink avail-bw range for these hosts. Confirming the findings in [14], the hosts are clearly divided into two groups: idle or active. More than 80% of the hosts had either over 90% avail-bw or a congested uplink. Less than 2% of the hosts exhibited an unclear trend ("grey" in Pathload), resulting in a wider avail-bw range, such as 50%-90%, and were thus excluded from the figure.

#### 5.2 A Ten-day Case Study

From the KAD participants, we selected hosts that were continuously online for over a month with the same (static) IP address. These hosts provided an excellent opportunity for a long-term analysis of the avail-bw evolution. However, they represent a specific subset of eMule hosts that may be continuously seeding file distributions, acting as traditional servers. We selected 82 of these hosts and measured them every 5 minutes for over 10 days. The capacity was also monitored to ensure it remained constant during this period. Figure 2(b) shows the average lower and upper bounds of the avail-bw for the entire measurement period. Over 30% of the hosts had a continuously congested uplink, indicating they were always uploading large amounts of data. More than 25% of the hosts were frequently idle, with an average of at least 75% avail-bw. It is important to note that the distribution in Figure 2(b) is less sharp compared to the snapshot in Figure 2(a) because it represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of averages computed over nearly 3000 estimates per host, while the latter is a single measurement.

A closer examination of the results revealed that some hosts displayed clear daily patterns in their avail-bw, while others did not. For instance, Figure 3(a) shows a host that was mostly idle during night hours but active during the day. In contrast, Figure 3(b) depicts a host with more gradual variations in its avail-bw over the measurement period. Generally, however, this set of hosts showed little change in their avail-bw between day and night, maintaining an active-inactive pattern with occasional steep variations.

Modern P2P file distribution applications use "tit-for-tat" algorithms, which encourage peers to actively participate in the distribution process. This means that peers upload data while downloading, leading to a more symmetrical use of bandwidth compared to client-server applications. Given that the uplink in an ADSL connection is much smaller than the downlink, eMule peers often experience uplink congestion before the downlink is saturated.

### 6. Conclusions

In this paper, we introduced FAB-Probe, a new measurement tool designed for non-cooperative ADSL environments, suitable for large-scale measurements. By rethinking previous techniques and focusing on accuracy and time requirements, FAB-Probe builds upon ABwProbe, from which the basic algorithm was derived. We developed a new sampling strategy that balances accuracy and measurement time, minimized the number of probing fleets, studied a method to detect uplink congestion, and improved cross-traffic filtering techniques. We validated the accuracy of FAB-Probe both in controlled laboratory settings and in real traffic conditions with the cooperation of an ISP. As a proof of concept, we used FAB-Probe to measure over 1300 ADSL hosts participating in KAD, providing a snapshot of the avail-bw distribution and a detailed characterization of 82 hosts over ten days.
