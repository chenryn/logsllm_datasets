queue manager name is unavailable or its name cannot be determined, channel-related messages are
placed in the /QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors subdirectory.
To examine the contents of any error log file, use your system editor, EDTF, to view the stream files in the
IFS.
Note:
1.Do not change ownership of these error logs.
2.If any error log file is deleted, it is automatically re-created when the next error message is logged.
Early errors
There are a number of special cases where the error logs have not yet been established and an error
occurs. IBM MQ attempts to record any such errors in an error log. The location of the log depends on how
much of a queue manager has been established.
If, because of a corrupted configuration file, for example, no location information can be determined,
errors are logged to an errors directory that is created at installation time.
If both the IBM MQ configuration file and the DefaultPrefix attribute of the AllQueueManagers stanza
are readable, errors are logged in the errors subdirectory of the directory identified by the DefaultPrefix
attribute.
Operator messages
Operator messages identify normal errors, typically caused directly by users doing things like using
parameters that are not valid on a command. Operator messages are national language enabled, with
message catalogs installed in standard locations.
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 359
These messages are written to the job log, if any. In addition, some operator messages are written to the
AMQERR01.LOG file in the queue manager directory, and others to the /QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors
directory copy of the error log.

Error logs in IBM MQ classes for JMS
Information about runtime problems that might require corrective action by the user is written to the IBM
MQ classes for JMS log.
For example, if an application attempts to set a property of a connection factory, but the name of the
property is not recognized, IBM MQ classes for JMS writes information about the problem to its log.
By default, the file containing the log is called mqjms.log and is in the current working
directory. However, you can change the name and location of the log file by setting the
com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.log.outputName property in the IBM MQ classes for JMS
configuration file. For more information about the IBM MQ classes for JMS configuration file, see The
IBM MQ classes for JMS/Jakarta Messaging configuration file. For more information about valid values

Suppressing channel error messages from error logs on
Multiplatforms
You can prevent selected messages from being sent to the error logs for a specified time interval, for
example if your IBM MQ system produces a large number of information messages that fill the error logs.
About this task
There are two ways of suppressing messages for a given time interval:
• By using SuppressMessage and SuppressInterval in the QMErrorLog stanza in the qm.ini file. This
method enables you to suppress the error messages listed in Diagnostic message service stanzas.
• By using the environment variables MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS and
MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_INTERVAL. This method enables you to suppress any channel messages.
Procedure
• To suppress messages for a given time interval by using the QMErrorLog stanza in the qm.ini file,
specify the messages that are to be written to the queue manager error log once only during a given
time interval with SuppressMessage, and specify the time interval for which the messages are to be
suppressed with SuppressInterval.
For example, to suppress the messages AMQ9999, AMQ9002, AMQ9209 for 30 seconds, include the
following information in the QMErrorLog stanza of the qm.ini file:
SuppressMessage=9001,9002,9202
SuppressInterval=30
Alternatively, instead of editing the qm.ini file directly, you can use the
Extended Queue Manager properties page in IBM MQ Explorer to exclude and suppress messages.
• To suppress messages for a given time interval by using the environment variables
MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS and MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_INTERVAL, complete the following
steps:
a)Specify the messages that are to be suppressed with MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS.
You can include up to 20 channel error message codes in a comma-separated list. There is
no restrictive list of message ids that can be included in the MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS
environment variable. However, the message ids must be channel messages (that is AMQ9xxx:
messages).
The following examples are for messages AMQ9999, AMQ9002, AMQ9209.
– On AIX and Linux:
export MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS=9999,9002,9209
– On Windows:
set MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_MSGS=9999,9002,9209
b)Specify the time interval for which the messages are to be suppressed with
MQ_CHANNEL_SUPPRESS_INTERVAL.
The default value is 60,5 which means that after the first five occurrences of a given message in a
60 second interval, any further occurrences of that message are suppressed until the end of that 60
second interval. A value of 0,0 means always suppress. A value of 0,n where n > 0 means never
suppress.

First Failure Support Technology (FFST)
First Failure Support Technology (FFST) for IBM MQ provides information about events that, in the case of
an error, can help IBM support personnel to diagnose the problem.
First Failure Data Capture (FFDC) provides an automated snapshot of the system environment when an
internal event occurs. In the case of an error, this snapshot is used by IBM support personnel to provide a
better understanding of the state of the system and IBM MQ when the problem occurred.
The information about an event is contained in an FFST file. In IBM MQ, FFST files have a file type of FDC.
FFST files do not always indicate an error. An FFST might be informational.
Monitoring and housekeeping
Here are some tips to help you with managing FFST events:
• Monitor FFST events for your system, and ensure that appropriate and timely remedial action is taken
when an event occurs. In some cases, the FDC files might be expected and can therefore be ignored,
for example FFST events that arise when IBM MQ processes are ended by the user. By appropriate
monitoring, you can determine which events are expected, and which events are not.
• FFST events are also produced for events outside IBM MQ. For example, if there is a problem with the
IO subsystem or network, this problem can be reported in an FDC type file. These types of event are
outside the control of IBM MQ and you might need to engage third parties to investigate the root cause.
• Ensure that good housekeeping of FFST files is carried out. The files must be archived and the directory
or folder must be cleared to ensure that only the most recent and relevant FDC files are available,
should the support team need them.
Use the information in the following links to find out the names, locations, and contents of FFST files in
different platforms.

FFST: IBM MQ for AIX or Linux
Describes the name, location, and contents of the First Failure Support Technology ( FFST ) files for AIX
and Linux systems.
On IBM MQ for AIX or Linux systems, FFST information is recorded in a file in the /var/mqm/errors
directory.
An FFST file contains one or more records. Each FFST record contains information about an error that is
normally severe, and possibly unrecoverable. These records indicate either a configuration problem with
the system or an IBM MQ internal error.
FFST files are named AMQ nnnnn.mm.FDC, where:
nnnnn
Is the ID of the process reporting the error
mm
Starts at 0. If the full file name already exists, this value is incremented by one until a unique FFST file
name is found. An FFST file name can already exist if a process is reused.
An instance of a process will write all FFST information to the same FFST file. If multiple errors occur
during a single execution of the process, an FFST file can contain many records.
In order to read the contents of a FFST file, you must be either the creator of the file, or a member of the
mqm group.
When a process writes an FFST record, it also sends a record to syslog. The record contains the name of
the FFST file to assist in automatic problem tracking. The syslog entry is made at the user.error level.
See the operating system documentation about syslog.conf for information about configuring this.
The Function Stack and Trace History are used by IBM to assist in problem determination. In many cases
there is little that the system administrator can do when an FFST report is generated, apart from raising
problems through the IBM Support Center.
However, there are some problems that the system administrator might be able to solve. If the FFST
shows out of resource or out of space on device descriptions when calling one of the IPC functions (for
example, semop or shmget ), it is likely that the relevant kernel parameter limit has been exceeded.
If the FFST report shows a problem with setitimer, it is likely that a change to the kernel timer
parameters is needed.
To resolve these problems, increase the IPC limits, rebuild the kernel, and restart the machine.
First Failure Support Technology ( FFST ) files and AIX and Linux clients
FFST logs are written when a severe IBM MQ error occurs. They are written to the directory /var/mqm/
errors.
These are normally severe, unrecoverable errors and indicate either a configuration problem with the
system or an IBM MQ internal error.
The files are named AMQnnnnn.mm.FDC, where:
• nnnnn is the process ID reporting the error
• mm is a sequence number, normally 0
When a process creates an FFST it also sends a record to the system log. The record contains the name of
the FFST file to assist in automatic problem tracking.
The system log entry is made at the "user.error" level.
364 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
First Failure Support Technology is explained in detail in First Failure Support Technology ( FFST ).
FFST: IBM MQ for IBM i
Describes the name, location, and contents of the First Failure Support Technology ( FFST ) files for IBM i
systems.
For IBM i, FFST information is recorded in a stream file in the /QIBM/UserData/mqm/errors directory.
These errors are normally severe, unrecoverable errors, and indicate either a configuration problem with
the system or an IBM MQ internal error.
The stream files are named AMQ nnnnn.mm.FDC, where:
• nnnnn is the ID of the process reporting the error.
• mm is a sequence number, normally 0.
A copy of the job log of the failing job is written to a file with the same name as the .FDC file. The file name
ends with .JOB.
Some typical FFST data is shown in the following example.
