collecting environment-related data, 2) a “recognition system”2
that uses sensor data to identify the objects and changes in
the environment around the AV, 3) a “planner and controller”
system that is responsible for planning the next motion of
the car based on the current parameters of the AV and the
environment (e.g., speed, location, and other vehicles), and
4) a “follower” system that signals the “actuators” to drive the
vehicle along the path chosen by the “planner and controller.”
STPA employs concepts from systems and control theories to
model hierarchical control structures in which the components
at each level of the hierarchy impose safety constraints
on the activity of the levels below and communicate their
conditions and behavior to the levels above them. Accidents
and disengagements are complex dynamic processes resulting
from inadequate perception control and decision-making at
different layers of the system control structure. Accidents and
disengagements seen in the data were overlaid on this structure.
In every control loop, the planner and controller system uses
an algorithm to generate the control actions based on a model of
the current state of the process that it is controlling. The control
actions (e.g., “decelerate”) taken by the planner and controller
system (i.e., the autonomous driving system) change the state
of the controlled process (e.g., mechanical components of the
autonomous vehicle). The feedback message (e.g., the state of
the trafﬁc lights) sent back from the controlled process (e.g., the
AV control software) updates the process model used (e.g., the
mental model the driver has of the AV status) by the controller.
Analysis of dependencies along those control loops allows
for the identiﬁcation of inadequate controls and the potential
causes of those unsafe control actions through examination
of the operation of components and their interactions in each

loop of the control structure. Any ﬂaws or inadequacies in
the algorithm, the process model, or the feedback used by a
controller are considered potential causal factors leading to
unsafe control actions and resultant disengagements/accidents.
In Fig. 3 we highlight three control loops (CL-1, CL-2,
and CL-3, indicated with different types of dashed lines) to
illustrate details of the interactions among the driver (both
AV and Non-AV), AV control, and AV hardware/software
components. Our analysis couples that STPA approach with
manufacturers’ reports. The most complex control loop, CL-1,
involves interaction among the autonomous control (including
sensors, recognition system, planner, and controller), mechan-
ical system (actuators and mechanical components of the
vehicle), and human drivers (drivers of non-AVs). The Non-AV
Driver module represents the AV system’s ability to 1) collect
the data on Non-AV driver behavior through the sensors, and
2) provide information (e.g., on brake signals, turn indicators,
or horn) to Non-AV drivers. Examples of failures in this control
loop were discussed in the two case studies presented earlier.
C. Data Sources
The CA DMV is the state agency that registers motor
vehicles, issues regulations and permits, and monitors the
testing and ﬁeld operation of autonomous vehicles. California
driving conditions are representative of urban situations and
the DMV has a strong mandate for data collection and public
availability. California law requires the manufacturers operating
and testing AVs to ﬁle reports on disengagements (reported
annually) and accidents (reported within ten business days
of the incident) [16], [28]; these reports are eventually made
public. The reports are available as a part of two databases:
1) AV Disengagement Reports: These reports contain aggre-
gated information about ﬂeet size, monthly autonomous
miles traveled, and the number of disengagements observed.
Each manufacturer provides its own data format, resulting
in a fragmented set of data. Some manufacturers provide
additional information, including timestamps, road type
(e.g., urban streets, highway, freeway), weather conditions
(e.g., sunny, raining, overcast), driver reaction times (time
taken for the driver to disengage from autonomous mode),
and other factors contributing to the disengagements. We
use the additional data whenever it is available.
2) AV Accident Reports: These reports contain timestamped
information about the autonomous vehicle involved, the
location of the accident, descriptions of other vehicles
involved (e.g., class of vehicle, speed), and human-written
textual description of the incident and its severity.
Both datasets consist of scanned documents containing
both tabulated data and natural-language text. Unlike previous
analyses [29], [30], which are based solely on the data provided,
we focus on building an analysis workﬂow that processes
substantive amounts of human-generated disengagement and
accident reports by using NLP.
Summary of Datasets. The datasets cover 12 AV manufac-
turers (Bosch, Delphi Automotive, Google, Nissan, Mercedes-
Benz, Tesla Motors, BMW, GM, Ford, Honda, Uber, and
Volkswagen). With 144 AVs that drove a cumulative 1, 116, 605
autonomous miles across 9 distinct road types (31.7% on city
streets, 29.26% on highways, 14.63% on interstates, 9.75% on
freeways, and the remaining 14.6% in parking lots, suburban,
and rural roads). Uber, BMW, Ford, and Honda reported too
few disengagements for us to draw statistically signiﬁcant
conclusions, so are left out of the analysis in this paper. Across
all manufacturers, we observe a total of 5, 328 disengagements3
and 42 accidents (including the two case studies in Section II).
Aggregating per car and per manufacturer, we observe an
average of 262 autonomous miles driven per disengagement,
and one accident event for every 127 disengagements.
Across manufacturers in the dataset, we observe a signif-
icant skew in the number of autonomous miles driven (see
Table I). For example, Waymo tested their AV prototypes more
extensively than the others (over 1,000,000 miles compared to
15,000 miles for the next highest testing manufacturer). This
suggests that Waymo’s AVs might perform better than those
of its competitors because of the extensive testing of the ADS
platform. Note that not all manufacturers provide all the data
needed to compute the summary statistics; those omissions are
indicated by dashes in Table I.
3Two of the manufacturers (Bosch and GMCruise) reported all their
disengagement data as planned tests. Our understanding, based on all the
DMV reports, is that the tests were planned, but the disengagements occurred
naturally. Together the two manufacturers have 14 accidents during “tests”.

IV. DATA-ANALYSIS WORKFLOW: PARSING, FILTERING,
NORMALIZATION AND NLP
Fig. 1 describes our methodology (workﬂow) for converting
raw disengagement and accident reports into a consolidated
form that lends itself to further analysis. Below, we describe
the key steps involved in Stages II and III of the workﬂow.
Digitization of the Accident and Disengagement Reports.
The aforementioned logs are provided in the form of scanned
images of digital documents (for disengagement reports) and
hand written reports (for accident reports). The ﬁrst task
is to pre process and convert these scanned reports into a
machine-encoded format. Examples of such machine-encoded
