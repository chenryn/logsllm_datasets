### Inability to Predict Behavior of Non-AV

#### Overview
The inability to predict the behavior of non-autonomous vehicles (Non-AVs) is a significant challenge in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. This unpredictability can lead to various issues, including software errors, incorrect or untimely inferences, and mechanical failures. The following sections detail the key components and potential failure points in an AV system.

#### Key Components and Failure Points

1. **Driver (Non-AV)**
   - **Software Error**: Errors in the control software can lead to incorrect or delayed responses.
   - **Incorrect/Untimely Inference**: The planner and controller may make wrong decisions based on inaccurate or delayed data.
   - **Recognition System**: Failures in the recognition system, such as sensor malfunctions or data corruption, can result in misidentification of objects and environmental changes.
   - **Control Software Malfunction**: Faults in the control software can cause the vehicle to behave unpredictably.
   - **Mechanical System**:
     - **Actuators**: Mechanical failures in actuators can prevent the vehicle from executing the planned actions.
     - **Sensors**: Malfunctions in sensors like GPS, RADAR, LIDAR, Camera, and SONAR can lead to incorrect data input.

2. **Autonomous Control**
   - **Planner and Controller**:
     - **Software Error**: Errors in the planning and control algorithms can lead to unsafe actions.
     - **Incorrect/Untimely Inference**: Delays or inaccuracies in processing sensor data can result in poor decision-making.
   - **Recognition System**:
     - **Network Failure**: Communication breakdowns between the recognition system and other components can cause delays or loss of critical information.
     - **Sensor Malfunction**: Issues with sensors can lead to incorrect or incomplete data.
   - **Follower System**:
     - **Mechanical Failures**: Failures in the mechanical components can prevent the vehicle from following the planned path.
     - **Control Software Malfunction**: Faults in the control software can cause the follower system to malfunction.

3. **Potential Outcomes**
   - **Disengagement**: The AV system may disengage, requiring the human driver to take control.
   - **Accident**: Unpredictable behavior can lead to accidents involving the AV and other vehicles or objects.

### Hierarchical Control Structure

Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchical control structure of an AV, based on [22]. The control loops (CL-1, CL-2, and CL-3) highlight the interactions among the driver, AV control, and hardware/software components.

1. **Environment Data Collection**: The first step involves collecting data about the environment using various sensors.
2. **Recognition System**: This system uses sensor data to identify objects and changes in the environment around the AV.
3. **Planner and Controller**: This system plans the next motion of the car based on the current parameters of the AV and the environment (e.g., speed, location, and other vehicles).
4. **Follower System**: This system signals the actuators to drive the vehicle along the path chosen by the planner and controller.

### STPA Analysis

System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) employs concepts from systems and control theories to model hierarchical control structures. Each level of the hierarchy imposes safety constraints on the levels below and communicates its conditions and behavior to the levels above. Accidents and disengagements are complex dynamic processes resulting from inadequate perception, control, and decision-making at different layers of the system control structure.

In every control loop, the planner and controller system uses an algorithm to generate control actions based on a model of the current state of the process. The control actions (e.g., "decelerate") change the state of the controlled process (e.g., mechanical components of the AV). Feedback messages (e.g., the state of traffic lights) update the process model used by the controller.

### Data Sources

The California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) registers motor vehicles, issues regulations and permits, and monitors the testing and field operation of AVs. California law requires manufacturers operating and testing AVs to file reports on disengagements (annually) and accidents (within ten business days of the incident). These reports are made public and are available in two databases:

1. **AV Disengagement Reports**: These reports contain aggregated information about fleet size, monthly autonomous miles traveled, and the number of disengagements observed. Some manufacturers provide additional details such as timestamps, road type, weather conditions, and driver reaction times.
2. **AV Accident Reports**: These reports contain timestamped information about the AV involved, the location of the accident, descriptions of other vehicles involved, and a textual description of the incident and its severity.

### Summary of Datasets

The datasets cover 12 AV manufacturers (Bosch, Delphi Automotive, Google, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla Motors, BMW, GM, Ford, Honda, Uber, and Volkswagen). With 144 AVs that drove a cumulative 1,116,605 autonomous miles across 9 distinct road types, we observe a total of 5,328 disengagements and 42 accidents. On average, there are 262 autonomous miles driven per disengagement, and one accident event for every 127 disengagements.

### Data-Analysis Workflow

Our methodology for converting raw disengagement and accident reports into a consolidated form for further analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Digitization of Reports**: Convert scanned images of digital documents and handwritten reports into machine-encoded formats.
2. **Parsing and Filtering**: Extract and filter relevant information from the digitized reports.
3. **Normalization**: Standardize the extracted data to ensure consistency.
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Use NLP to categorize and analyze the textual data.

By following this workflow, we can effectively process and analyze substantial amounts of human-generated disengagement and accident reports.
