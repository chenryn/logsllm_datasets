The traditional assumption with respect
C. Emerging threats: sensors, remote attacks, and privacy
to IMDs and
BANs is that many physiological signals stay within a
patient’s body, limiting the exﬁltration of data and the pos-
sibility for signal injection attacks. Recent studies, however,
show that both are possible.
intentional
To date, the design constraints of IMDs have carefully
dealt with the possibility of accidental electromagnetic in-
terference, but do not consider the possibility of an active
attacker. Recent work by Foo Kune et al. [22] shows
that
interference at a CIED sensor interface
is possible. By injecting a signal that mimics a cardiac
waveform, Foo Kune et al. show that it is theoretically
possible to alter the therapy delivered by the CIED, although
the current range of this attack is very limited (on the
order of a few centimeters). Reliance on sensor readings
to achieve accurate and timely actuation, combined with
increasingly sophisticated attacks, highlights the need to
carefully consider adversarial capabilities and how best to
achieve trustworthy systems.
Similarly,
if the assumption that certain physiological
signals stay within the human body is incorrect, both the
security and privacy of schemes may be affected. For exam-
ple, the use of physiological values as a source of entropy
in key agreement schemes relies heavily on the assumption
that it is not feasible for an adversary to observe the given
biometric. A standard assumption in current literature is
that the adversary cannot make physical contact with the
target patient. In this sense, protocols that make use of
physiological values to generate a shared key can be viewed
as body-coupled communication protocols, whereby the key
is transmitted via the human body. Although the assumption
that an adversary does not have physical contact has merit
in practice, we remark that this adversarial model neglects
subtle classes of attacks by people known to the victim;
ideally, new technologies should not enable “perfect crime”
scenarios, even for the most sophisticated of attackers.
As more and more people become active participants in
(potentially insecure) BANs, moreover, it may be possible
for a person close to the victim (i.e., with physical contact)
to inadvertently aid a remote attacker (e.g., by leaking
patient biometrics or performing signal injection attacks on
sensors/wireless telemetry).
Remote attackers are also a concern today, especially
with respect
to observing physiological values assumed
to be secret. Rostami et al. [45] and Chang et al. [52]
both recognize the need to consider remote sensing of IPI.
Rostami et al. attempt to extract IPI from video footage
of the target, following work by Poh et al. [98] on the
correlation between color ﬂuctuations and IPI. Although
Rostami et al. fail to replicate these results, other recent work
in this area [99], [100] indicates that such attacks deserve
further attention.
As a ﬁnal remark, recent results in Bagade et al. [23]
show that the ECG data of one person may be observable
from another person’s physiological signals, if the two are
in physical contact. That is, if two individuals touch, the
ECG of one person is coupled to the EEG of the other
person. We conclude that while the use of ECG (and other
physiological values) as a security mechanism appears to
hold some promise, cryptanalysis and entropy assessments
need to be undertaken more rigorously.
A related area of research is the study of neurostimu-
lators, which are IMDs designed to send electrical pulses
to the nervous system, including the brain. These devices
are used to treat conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s,
and obsessive compulsive disorder, with ongoing human
trials exploring their efﬁcacy in treating severe depression.
Very little computer security and privacy research has been
completed on these devices, and as the technology pro-
gresses, the need for further work in this area becomes
more pressing. Denning et al. [66] give a brief overview
of potential security and privacy implications with respect to
neurostimulators, but concrete results in this area are lacking.
A related question is explored by Martinovic et al. [55]:
the authors’ side channel attacks in the context of brain-
computer interfaces (BCIs), which measure and respond
dynamically to a user’s brain activities, thereby allowing
communication without words or gestures. Although the
study is preliminary in nature, Martinovic et al.’s results
support the hypothesis that personal information, such as
passwords and whether or not a particular person is known
to the target, may unintentionally leak through BCI use.
VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we have given a cohesive narrative of
security and privacy research in IMDs and BANs, analyzing
current and emerging research trends: namely the security of
the IMD/BAN telemetry and sensor interfaces and the need
for trustworthy software. Our analysis in Section V-A shows
that much attention has been paid to securing the telemetry
interface and many useful approaches have been developed.
We have identiﬁed several areas for future work, such
as the need for a more rigorous assessment of the use of
physiological values as a source of entropy for cryptographic
keys. As mentioned in Section V-B, the increasing complex-
ity of software in IMDs and the history of FDA software-
related recalls highlights the need for future work ensuring
the trustworthiness of IMD and BAN software.
Finally, as discussed in Section VI-C, the possibility of
EMI attacks on the sensor interface and eavesdropping on
physiological signals formerly thought to be private is in-
dicative of the need for a more nuanced approach to security
and privacy research for medical devices. Computing devices

that interface with the brain are becoming more advanced
and more popular, both in the entertainment (in the form
of BCI-integrated gaming) and health care industries (in
the form of neurostimulators). The ability to record and
analyze brainwaves in real time using implanted computing
devices that alter the brain’s functionality has far-reaching
implications for security and privacy, moving well beyond
the traditional treatment of these topics in computer security.
