Hi,
I cannot find a way to define multiple tasks which executes different commands
in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file of my project directory.
From what I understood, I can only declare a single TaskConfiguration within
this file. Am I wrong?
To make my problem more understandable, let's say I would like to define 3
tasks with their own set of arguments:
  * foo: `foo --arg`
  * bar1: `bar --arg 1`
  * bar2: `bar --arg 2`
How can I make `tasks.json` reflect this need?
