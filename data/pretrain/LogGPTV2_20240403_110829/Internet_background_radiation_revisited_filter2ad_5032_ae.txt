and “cosynus”.
We contacted Cosynus, a German software publishing com-
pany, that owns the Cosynus Blackberry connector, to verify
the source of this traﬃc. This software allows Tobit soft-
ware’s David to run on the blackberry. Tobit’s David soft-
ware is a multimedia application available for Windows that
consists of E-mail, speech, fax, RSS and instant messaging.
Cosynus conﬁrmed that some of their customers entered
“062” as the ﬁrst octet of an IP address during conﬁguration.
This is interpreted as octal, resulting in the traﬃc being sent
to 50.153.199.194 instead of 62.153.199.194. Cosynus oﬀered
to ﬁrewall the victim IP address in future client updates,
which should allow this /24 netblock to become useable.

5.6 eMule to 35.206.63.212
In each week-long capture of 35/8 (datasets A-2, B-2, C-
2), 1.0% of packets and 0.9% of bytes were for a speciﬁc des-
tination IP 35.206.63.212. Of this, roughly 83% was UDP
packets, mostly with 18 bytes of data. The ﬁrst two bytes
of these packets are the same (e3 9a), followed by 16 bytes
of varied data. These packets, when interpreted with the
eDonkey protocol, a peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing protocol, indi-
cate that these are “Get Sources” packets, used to fetch a
seed-list for a given ﬁle hash.
We found that 35.206.63.212 was listed as a fake server on
the oﬃcial eMule forum [30], conﬁrming that this traﬃc is
in fact peer-to-peer traﬃc using the eDonkey protocol.
5.7
µTorrent trafﬁc
Recently, newer versions of the popular bittrorrent client
µTorrent have implemented a new protocol called Micro
Transport Protocol (µTP), to provide better congestion con-
trol for bittorrent connections. µTP runs on top of UDP, al-
lowing the µTorrent application to perform congestion con-
trol on its bittorrent streams independent of TCP congestion
control.
In each of our datasets we were able to observe approxi-
mately 4 MBit/s of µTP traﬃc. This traﬃc consists primar-
ily of 33 byte packets, to various UDP ports. The destina-
tion IPs seem to be varied as well, though the source IP for
a given destination IP appears to send packets only to that
destination IP. In other words, each source IP sends several
packets to only a single destination IP.
Each 33 byte UDP packet starts with 12 bytes of changing
72data, followed by 21 bytes of data that is the same in all
packets: 7f ﬀ ﬀ ﬀ ab 02 04 00 01 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00. We were able to conﬁrm that this 21 byte sequence
occurs in packets generated during a torrent download with
a recent version of µTorrent.
5.8 Responding to Pollution
In responding to these unique forms of pollution, we adopt
the philosophy of the original authors of [10] to build classi-
ﬁers for the removal of the unwanted traﬃc. Our purpose,
however, is diﬀerent. Unlike [10], we are not attempting to
reduce traﬃc in order to build a scalable active responder,
our goal instead is to determine the usability of a network
block and the utility of any cleanup eﬀort. Given the con-
centrated nature of much of this pollution, these classiﬁers
need not be complicated and may often simply ﬁlter based
on net-blocks. Table 8 lists the top 10 most polluted /24
network blocks in 1/8. Together these account for 75% of
all packets and 85% of all bytes of pollution traﬃc to the
1/8 network block. Based on this, APNIC has already pro-
posed the following ﬁlters for one of their recently allocated
blocks based on this philosophy: “The following /24s should
be withheld from general allocation by APNIC: 1.0.0.0/24,
1.1.1.0/24, 1.2.3.0/24, 1.4.0.0/24, 1.10.10.0/24. If further in-
vestigation reveals that the traﬃc to any of these /24s abates
to a normal background level in the future, then these ad-
dresses would be returned to the APNIC unallocated address
pool at that time.”
We also know that a cleanup of some of the pollution to
50/8 is possible, as we have contacted the software vendors
responsible for the misconﬁguration. Their response was
helpful in eliminating the pollution being caused by their
software. The pollution traﬃc which we were able to identify
as SIP was originating from only a few thousands of sources
and the iperf pollution traﬃc was originating from only a
few tens of unique sources. These as well as other similar
types of pollution can likely be minimized with a sustained
cleanup eﬀort.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we have taken a fresh look at Internet back-
ground radiation. While today’s Internet radiation contin-
ues to be as ubiquitous, variegated, and dynamic as was un-
covered in the initial study [10], we note several important
changes since the last study including: rapid growth outpac-
ing the growth in productive network traﬃc, reduced contri-
bution from the exploit ports reported in previous work, and
trends toward increasing SYN and decreasing SYN-ACK
traﬃc. In examining traﬃc across address blocks, we note
that signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist, but often these diﬀerences
are clustered in a handful of network blocks. We use the
term Internet address pollution to refer to this signiﬁcant
nonuniform behavior that is primarily the result of environ-
mental rather than algorithmic factors. We examine several
case studies in Internet address pollution and oﬀer some
speciﬁc suggestions for ﬁltering the most egregious of these
blocks.
We would like to develop a more systematic process that
passes all newly allocated network blocks through an eval-
uation phase, where potential usability of the block is as-
sessed. Any recipient of a tainted network block will be
unfairly penalized in terms of bandwidth costs and actual
usability of their address space. Therefore, it is important
that any such network blocks that are found be placed on a
well-known temporary watch list, publicized to the network
operator community. Furthermore, address block tainting
is not simply a result of Internet background radiation, but
can also occur when address space is re-allocated from one
user to another. Prior ownership of an address block might
have resulted in that network block being placed on various
spam or botnet blacklists, thereby aﬀecting its usability. We
would like to work with the RIRs and the Internet opera-
tor community to understand how a simple process can be
put in place which attempts to mitigate the aﬀect of address
block pollution, either via the dissemination of widespread
ﬁlters or via a sustained cleanup eﬀort. A related issue is
of the study address pollution beyond unallocated or re-
allocated blocks, including the problem of discovering and
removing pollution in already allocated and routed blocks.
While some work has been done on examining what is nor-
mal for background radiation [7] and how to maximize visi-
bility to unused space within a network [31], we believe this
is a very interesting future area of study.
We view this work as yet another step in understanding
the interesting phenomenon of Internet background radia-
tion. As such, we hope to encourage follow-on work in this
area by making the datasets used here available via the PRE-
DICT [16] dataset archive. We acknowledge that the cur-
rent policy for PREDICT limits the use of these datasets
to research carried out at US institutions. We will con-
tinue to work with existing internal PREDICT eﬀorts to
broaden participation beyond its initial scope. Until these
eﬀorts bear fruit, the authors encourage interested non-US
researchers to contact them directly to investigate alterna-
tive paths to data sharing, including jointly seeking insti-
tutionally approved research studies (e.g., via research over-
sight organizations such as the US institutional review board
system and similar systems abroad) and/or through entering
into researcher-speciﬁc data sharing agreements.
