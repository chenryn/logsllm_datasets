# Description of the new feature/enhancement
In Windows 10, whenever Windows Terminal is launched it automatically launches
as the Powershell profile even when opening a new terminal tab. The user
should have free control on which profile they wish to use as default.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
This can be done by adding an attribute (setDefault or some other) to each
profile and whichever is selected as "true" the rest are automatically set to
"false" and if the user does not do this then the default profile set during
install is used.
