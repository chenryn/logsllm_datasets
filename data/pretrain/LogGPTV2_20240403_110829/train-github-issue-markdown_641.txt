# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement
In Windows 10, when Windows Terminal is launched, it automatically opens with the PowerShell profile, even when a new terminal tab is created. To enhance user experience, the feature should allow users to set their preferred default profile. This would provide more flexibility and control over the initial profile that is launched.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To implement this feature, an attribute such as `setDefault` can be added to each profile in the configuration file. The user can then select which profile they want to use as the default by setting the `setDefault` attribute to `true` for that specific profile. When one profile is set to `true`, all other profiles will automatically be set to `false`. If the user does not specify a default profile, the system will use the default profile that was set during the installation of Windows Terminal.

This approach ensures that the user has full control over the default profile while maintaining a simple and intuitive configuration process.
