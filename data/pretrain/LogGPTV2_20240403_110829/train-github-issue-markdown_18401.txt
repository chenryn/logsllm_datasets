I downloaded neo4j-master from github, today.  
Within neo4j-master there is a directory :
neo4j-master/community/io/src/main/java/org/neo4j/io
I also obtained the community edition 2.16, which should contain all the jars
for neo4j projects.  
However, there is no neo4j.io.jar corresponding to the neo4j-master code
above.
I tried to compile neo4j-master/community/embedded-
examples/src/main/java/org/neo4j/examples/NewMatrix.java  
The last import :: "import org.neo4j.io.fs.FileUtils;" was missing.
I obtained neo4j-io-2.2.0-M02.jar from
http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.neo4j/neo4j-io/2.2.0-M02  
and added it to my project. The project then compiled and ran fine...  
Further, the online javadoc for neo4j 2.16 does not cover package org.neo4j.io  
(http://neo4j.com/docs/2.1.6/javadocs/)
It would be nice if there was a community version of neo4j which would compile
the examples, out of the box.
