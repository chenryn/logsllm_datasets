Today, I downloaded the `neo4j-master` repository from GitHub. Within this repository, there is a directory located at:

```
neo4j-master/community/io/src/main/java/org/neo4j/io
```

I also obtained the community edition 2.16, which should include all the necessary JAR files for Neo4j projects. However, I could not find a `neo4j-io.jar` file that corresponds to the `neo4j-master` code.

When I attempted to compile the `NewMatrix.java` example located in:

```
neo4j-master/community/embedded-examples/src/main/java/org/neo4j/examples/NewMatrix.java
```

I encountered an issue because the import statement `import org.neo4j.io.fs.FileUtils;` was missing.

To resolve this, I obtained the `neo4j-io-2.2.0-M02.jar` file from the Maven repository (http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.neo4j/neo4j-io/2.2.0-M02) and added it to my project. After doing so, the project compiled and ran successfully.

Additionally, I noticed that the online Javadoc for Neo4j 2.16 (http://neo4j.com/docs/2.1.6/javadocs/) does not cover the `org.neo4j.io` package.

It would be beneficial if there were a community version of Neo4j that includes all the necessary dependencies to compile and run the examples out-of-the-box.
