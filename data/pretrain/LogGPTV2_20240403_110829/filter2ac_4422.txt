**ATT&CK ID:** T1029  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Scheduled Transfer

Adversaries may schedule data exfiltration to occur at specific times of day or at regular intervals. This tactic can help blend the malicious traffic with normal network activity, making it more difficult for defenders to detect. By aligning exfiltration with expected traffic patterns, adversaries can reduce the likelihood of raising suspicion and increase the chances of successfully transferring sensitive data.
