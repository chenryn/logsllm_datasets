On my dual-core, 32-bit Ubuntu test machine, the Julia tests fail to start when I run the following command:

```sh
~/julia$ make test
JULIA test/all
```

When I set the environment to use a single core, the `linalg1` test fails with the following error:

```sh
~/julia$ make test
JULIA test/all
* linalg1

Additionally, I noticed that the `linalg1` test seems to consume several hundred megabytes of RAM. Given that my virtual machine (VM) is only allocated 1 GB of RAM, this could be contributing to the issue. Is this expected behavior for the `linalg1` test?
