On my dual-core 32-bit ubuntu test machine, the tests fail to start.
    ~/julia$ make test
        JULIA test/all
Setting it to single core, the linalg1 test fails:
    ~/julia$ make test
        JULIA test/all
         * linalg1
    exception on 1: ERROR: assertion failed: |:(det(capd)) - :(det(apd))|  0.002384185791015625

(p.s. is this linalg1 test supposed to take several hundred megabytes of RAM?
I've only assigned my VM 1GB)
