**Email from PI:**

In the given code snippet, the list of prime numbers is defined as follows:
```go
primes := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2147483647}
```

From the historical context provided in the notes [1], it appears that this line may be an inside joke. However, I am somewhat conflicted because the Go project's ethos emphasizes meticulousness and attention to detail, stating, "We pride ourselves on being meticulous; no issue is too small." [2]

While I recognize the potential for humor, I feel it is important to maintain the integrity and accuracy of our code. Therefore, I am submitting this defect report with the understanding that it may not align with the intended humor.
