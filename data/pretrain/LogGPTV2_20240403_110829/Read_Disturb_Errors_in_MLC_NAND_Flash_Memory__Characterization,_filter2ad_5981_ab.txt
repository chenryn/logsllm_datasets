errors, though they are not yet available [10]. The ﬁrst mech-
anism is similar to the Read Disturb-Aware FTL [15], where
a block is rewritten after a ﬁxed number of page reads are
performed to the block (e.g., 50,000 reads for an MLC chip).
The second mechanism periodically inserts an additional read
(e.g., a read every 256 block reads) to a page within the block,
to check whether that page has experienced a read disturb error,
in which case the page is copied to a new block.
All of these proposals are orthogonal to our read disturb
mitigation techniques, and can be combined with our work
for even greater protection. None of these works perform
device-level experimental characterization of the read disturb
phenomenon, which we provide extensively in this paper.2
3. Read Disturb Characterization
In this section, we describe a series of observations and
characterizations that were performed using commercially-
available 2Y-nm MLC NAND ﬂash chips. We ﬁrst identify
trends directly related to the magnitude of perturbations that
take place during read disturb (Sec. 3.2). Next, we determine
the frequency at which errors occur in modern ﬂash devices
as a result of the read disturb phenomenon (Sec. 3.3). We then
examine the effect of changing the pass-through voltage, Vpass,
on the voltage shifts that result from read disturb (Sec. 3.4).
We also identify other errors that can result from changing
Vpass (Sec. 3.6), and show how many of these errors can
be tolerated by error correction mechanisms in modern ﬂash
devices (Sec. 3.7). These characterizations are used in Sec. 4
to drive our read disturb mitigation mechanism that tunes Vpass,
and in Sec. 5 for our read disturb error recovery mechanism.
3.1. Characterization Methodology
We use an FPGA-based NAND ﬂash testing platform in
order to characterize state-of-the-art ﬂash chips [1]. We use the
read-retry operation present within MLC NAND ﬂash devices
to accurately read the cell threshold voltage [3, 4, 6, 29]. As
threshold voltage values are proprietary information, we present
our results using a normalized threshold voltage, where the
nominal value of Vpass is equal to 512 in our normalized scale,
and where 0 represents GND.
One limitation of using commercial ﬂash devices is the
inability to alter the Vpass value, as no such interface currently
exists. We work around this by using the read-retry mechanism,
which allows us to change the read reference voltage Vref one
wordline at a time. Since both Vpass and Vref are applied
to wordlines, we can mimic the effects of changing Vpass
by instead changing Vref and examining the impact on the
wordline being read. We perform these experiments on one
wordline per block, and repeat them over ten different blocks.
3.2. Quantifying Read Disturb Perturbations
that
Our ﬁrst goal is to measure the amount of threshold voltage
shift
takes place inside a ﬂash cell due to read dis-
turb. These measurements are performed by ﬁrst programming
known pseudo-randomly generated data values into a selected
ﬂash block. Using read-retry techniques [3, 29],
the initial
threshold voltages are measured for all ﬂash cells in the block.
Then, we select a single page from the block to read, and
perform N repeated read operations on it. After the N reads,
we measure the threshold voltage for every ﬂash cell in the
2Recent work experimentally characterizes and proposes solutions for read
disturb errors in DRAM [19]. The mechanisms for disturbance and techniques
to mitigate them are different between DRAM and NAND ﬂash due to device-
level differences.

block to determine how much the threshold voltage for each
cell shifted. We repeat this process to measure the distribution
shift over an increasing number of read disturb occurrences.
Fig. 3a shows the distribution of the threshold voltages for
cells in a ﬂash block after 0, 250K, 500K, and 1 million read
operations. Fig. 3b zooms in on this to illustrate the distribution
for values in the ER state.3 We observe that states with lower
threshold voltages are slightly more vulnerable to shifts than
states with higher threshold voltages. This is due to applying the
same voltage (Vpass) to all cells during a read disturb operation,
regardless of their threshold voltages. A lower threshold voltage
on a cell induces a larger voltage difference (Vpass − Vth)
through the tunnel, and in turn generates a stronger tunneling
current, making the cell more vulnerable to read disturb.
The degree of the threshold voltage shift is broken down
further in Fig. 4, where we group cells by their initially-
programmed state. The ﬁgure demonstrates the shift in mean
threshold voltage for each group, as the number of read disturb
occurrences increases due to more reads being performed to
the block over time. Fig. 4a shows that for cells in the ER
state, there is a systematic shift of the cell threshold voltage
distribution to the right (i.e., to higher values), demonstrating
a signiﬁcant change as a result of read disturb. In contrast, the
increases for cells starting in the P1 (Fig. 4b) and P2 (Fig. 4c)
states are much more restricted, showing how the read disturb
effect becomes less prominent as Vth increases (as explained
above). For the P3 state, as shown in Fig. 4d, we actually
observe a decrease in the mean Vth. This decrease is due to the
effects of retention loss arising from charge leakage. As data
is held within each ﬂash cell, the stored charge slowly leaks
over time, with a different rate of leakage across different ﬂash
cells due to both process variation and uneven wear. For cells
in the P3 state, the effects of read disturb are minimal, and so
we primarily see the retention-caused drop in threshold voltage
(which is small).4 For cells starting in other states, the read
disturb phenomenon outweighs leakage due to retention loss,
resulting in increases in their means. Again, cells in the ER
state are most affected by read disturb.
Fig. 5 shows the change in the standard deviation of the
threshold voltage, again grouped by the initial threshold voltage
of the cell, after an increasing number of read disturb occur-
rences. For cells starting in the P1, P2, and P3 states, we observe
an increased spread in the threshold voltage distribution, a result
of both uneven read disturb effects and uneven retention loss.
For the ER state, we actually observe a slight reduction in the
deviation, which is a result of our measurement limitations:
3For now, we use a ﬂash block that has experienced 8,000 program/erase
(P/E) cycles. We will show sensitivity to P/E cycles in Sec. 3.3.
4Retention loss effects are observable in these results because it takes
approximately two hours to perform 200K read operations, due to the latency
between the ﬂash device and the FPGA host software.

cells in the ER state often have a negative Vth, but we can
only measure non-negative values of Vth, so the majority of
these cells do not show up in our distributions.
We conclude that the magnitude of the threshold voltage
shift for a cell due to read disturb (1) increases with the number
of read disturb operations, and (2) is higher if the cell has a
lower threshold voltage.
