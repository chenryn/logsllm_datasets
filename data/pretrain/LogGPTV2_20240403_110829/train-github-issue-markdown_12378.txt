##### Issue Type:
Bug report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.4.3
##### Environment:
RHEL 6.5 from RHEL 6.5; bug appears to be generic though.
##### Summary:
The hack at
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/runner/__init__.py#L586
appears to break filter usage (name={{item | basename }}).
##### Steps To Reproduce:
This code:
      - name: install RPMs
        yum: name=/root/{{ item }}
        notify: restart recursor
        with_items:
        - '{{ recursor_rpm_url | basename }}'
        - '{{ pdnsmgrd_rpm_url | basename }}'
Should behave identically to:
      - name: install RPMs
        yum: name=/root/{{ item | basename }}
        notify: restart recursor
        with_items:
        - '{{ recursor_rpm_url }}'
        - '{{ pdnsmgrd_rpm_url }}'
However, the second version feeds the full URLs (that I have in those vars) to
yum.
In both cases /root/ is dropped as well, but the first version accepts this
because ansible is running from /root anyway.
##### Expected Results:
Both versions do the same, honoring /root and | basename.
##### Actual Results:
One version works, mostly by accident. The other does not work at all.
