Abstract—BGP  route  leaks  frequently  precipitate  serious  dis-
ruptions  to  inter-domain  routing.  These  incidents  have  plagued 
the  Internet  for  decades  while  deployment  and  usability  issues 
cripple  efforts  to  mitigate  the  problem.  Peerlock,  presented  in 
2016,  addresses  route  leaks  with  a  new  approach.  Peerlock 
enables ﬁltering agreements between transit providers to protect 
their  own  networks  without  the  need  for  broad  cooperation 
or  a  trust  infrastructure.  We  outline  the  Peerlock  system  and 
one  variant,  Peerlock-lite,  and  conduct  live  Internet  experi-
ments  to  measure  their  deployment  on  the  control  plane.  Our 
measurements  ﬁnd  evidence  for  signiﬁcant  Peerlock  protection 
between  Tier  1  networks  in  the  peering  clique,  where  48%  of 
potential  Peerlock  ﬁlters  are  deployed,  and  reveal  that  many 
other  networks  also  deploy  ﬁlters  against  Tier  1  leaks.  To 
guide  further  deployment,  we  also  quantify  Peerlock’s  impact 
on  route  leaks  both  at  currently  observed  levels  and  under 
hypothetical  future  deployment  scenarios  via  BGP  simulation. 
These  experiments  reveal  present  Peerlock  deployment  restricts 
Tier 1 leak export to 10% or fewer networks for 40% of simulated 
leaks.  Strategic  additional  Peerlock-lite  deployment  at  all  large 
ISPs (<1% of all networks), in tandem with Peerlock within the 
peering  clique  as  deployed,  completely  mitigates  about  80%  of 
simulated  Tier  1  route  leaks.
I.  INTRODUCTION
The Internet consists of many Autonomous Systems (ASes)
with  distinct  IP  preﬁxes,  routing  policies,  and  inter-AS  con-
nections.  These  networks  exchange  routes  with  neighboring
ASes  over  the  control  plane  to  connect  hosts  in  disparate
ASes  and  create  the  illusion  for  users  of  a  single,  uniﬁed
Internet. Unfortunately, there are few security controls on route
exchange.  ASes  behaving  adversarially,  whether  intentionally
or by mistake, can export routes that should be kept internally
or  shared  with  only  a  subset  of  their  neighbors.  Because  the
language  ASes  use  to  communicate  -  the  Border  Gateway
Protocol  or  BGP  -  does  not  package  validation  information
with routes, remote networks often receive and propagate these
route  leaks  throughout  the  control  plane.  Leaks  frequently
steer user trafﬁc on the data plane onto unintended paths that
lack capacity for the additional trafﬁc. The end result is soaring
latency  or  complete  availability  loss  for  destination  services.

have highlighted the global impact of this problem.
leaks,
Existing tools designed to curtail
like the many
Internet Routing Registries (IRRs), are challenging to deploy
or limited in scope. IRRs are databases where ASes can
publish their routing policies. Other ASes can then convert
IRR-stored policies into ﬁlters to validate received routes. IRR-
based ﬁltering is limited by its requirement for broad AS
participation, however, as the motivations and sophistication
of network operators varies greatly between ASes [22]. Other
BGP security extensions, like the Resource Public Key Infras-
tructure (RPKI), only enable ﬁltering for a subset of leaks (e.g.
re-origination leaks for RPKI).
The Peerlock [44], [18] leak defense system was presented
in 2016 to address the need for a deployable solution. Each
Peerlock deployment occurs between two neighboring ASes,
the protector AS and protected AS. The protector AS agrees
to ﬁlter routes that transit the protected AS unless they arrive
directly from the protected AS or one of its designated
upstreams. The ﬁlter prevents the protector AS from propa-
gating or steering its trafﬁc onto any leaked route that transits
the protected AS, regardless of origin AS/destination preﬁx.
Peerlock is designed to leverage the rich web of relationships
that exist between transit networks in the Internet’s core, and
functions without coordination with other ASes on potential
leak paths. This makes Peerlock especially viable in the
peering clique formed by the 19 Tier 1 ASes that sit atop the
inter-domain routing hierarchy. A related technique, Peerlock-
lite, enables networks to spot likely leaks without prior out-
of-band communication. ASes deploying Peerlock-lite drop
routes arriving from customers that contain a Tier 1 AS; it
is highly improbable that customers are providing transit for
large global networks.

Our
ﬁrst
contribution
a measurement
of
Peerlock/Peerlock-lite deployment on the control plane.
In Section IV we design, execute, and evaluate active Internet
measurements to search for evidence of ﬁltering consistent
with these systems. Our experiments use BGP poisoning, a
technique used in prior work for trafﬁc engineering [42] and
path discovery [1], to mimic route leaks that transit some
target AS. We then listen for which networks propagate -
or ﬁlter - these "leaks" relative to control advertisements.
This information feeds several inference techniques designed
to uncover which ASes are Peerlocking for (protecting) the
target AS.
Notably, we ﬁnd substantial Peerlock deployment within the
peering clique: about 48% of possible ﬁltering rules (153/342)
are already implemented within this set. Further, many non-
Tier 1 ASes - including nearly 40% of large ISPs observed
during our experiments - perform some Peerlock-lite ﬁltering
on Tier 1 AS leaks. Evidence for Peerlock ﬁltering of non-Tier
1 leaks is virtually nonexistent, though three Tier 1 networks
(AS 12956, AS 2914, and AS 3320) each ﬁlter leaks for more
than 20 non-Tier 1 ASes.
After detecting current Peerlock/Peerlock-lite deployments,
we ask how well these systems mitigate Tier 1 leaks. Internet-
scale BGP simulations in Section V test over 6,000 simulated
Tier 1 leaks against observed Peerlock/Peerlock-lite levels to
quantify the effect of these systems as deployed. We test
the same leaks against six hypothetical extended deployment
scenarios to understand where additional ﬁlters should be
placed to isolate leaks.
We ﬁnd that Peerlock ﬁltering within the peering clique is
helpful, but not sufﬁcient to mitigate Tier 1 route leaks on
its own. Consistent with prior work on BGP ﬁltering [8], our
experiments show that positioning ﬁlters at relatively few ASes
- the roughly 600 large ISPs - can play a decisive role in leak
prevention. About 80% of simulated leaks were completely
mitigated by uniform Peerlock-lite ﬁlter deployment at large
ISPs, with fewer than 10% of leaks spreading beyond 10%
of the topology. These ﬁgures are especially encouraging
because Peerlock-lite is based on a simple route validity check
informed by the valley-free routing model [7] that requires no
out-of-band communication.
In this paper, we make the following key contributions:
• We give an overview of the Peerlock and Peerlock-
lite ﬁltering systems, and consider their beneﬁts and
limitations relative to existing tools in Section III.
• We describe how we adapt existing Internet measurement
techniques to probe Peerlock/Peerlock-lite deployment on
the control plane and introduce a novel inference method
in Section IV-A.
• We actively measure where Peerlock and Peerlock-lite
ﬁlters are deployed with PEERING [36] and CAIDA’s
BGPStream [34] in Section IV-B, with a discussion of
results in Section IV-C.
• We simulate thousands of Tier 1 route leaks against
several protection scenarios in Section V-B, and present
a new path encoding method to understand how these
scenarios inﬂuence leak propagation and export in Sec-
tion V-C.
II. BACKGROUND
A. The Border Gateway Protocol
The Internet is a confederation of about 69,000 smaller
networks, called Autonomous Systems or ASes. ASes exchange
routing information via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
to enable global connectivity. Each AS originates routes to its
hosted preﬁxes; these routes are advertised to neighbors via
BGP updates. Each update contains a preﬁx and a collection
of other attributes, including an AS PATH that describes the
2
route’s AS-level hops. ASes compare all received updates via
the BGP decision process to select a single best path to every
destination preﬁx. Both path qualities (like AS PATH length)
and local network policies (e.g., business relationship with
advertising AS) are taken in account when selecting a best
path, but policies take precedence in the process. Once an AS
selects a best path for a given preﬁx, it prepends its unique
AS number (ASN) to the path and advertises only that path to
its neighbors.
Paths learned from customer ASes - those purchasing
transit - are advertised to all connections. Provider-learned
routes, meanwhile, are generally only advertised to an AS’s
customers. Peer ASes exchange trafﬁc without compensation,
and likewise advertise routes learned from one another only
to customer ASes. Limitations on non-customer learned route
export prevents customer ASes from transiting trafﬁc between
peers/providers at their own expense. This dynamic, known as
the Gao-Rexford or valley-free routing model [7], guides the
exchange of routes on the control plane. No widely-deployed
mechanism enforces this model, but the economic incentives
it describes shape AS path export behavior.
The customer cone [10] is one product of this model. An
AS’s customer cone is the set of all ASes reachable from the
AS via only provider to customer links. Stated simply, these
are the AS’s direct and indirect customers. Customer cone
size is one of the few publicly observable features commonly
used to judge an AS’s inﬂuence on the control plane, e.g.
in CAIDA’s AS ranking [50]. Customer cone size is the
basis for the UCLA classiﬁcation presented in [33] widely
used in research on this topic [41], [49], [1], [4], [53]. This
scheme separates ASes into 1) Tier 1 ASes, who have no
providers, form a peering clique, and can transit trafﬁc to any
preﬁx without compensation, 2) large ISPs with more than 50
customer cone ASes, 3) small ISPs with 5-50 customer cone
ASes, and 4) stub ASes with fewer than 5 direct or indirect
customer networks.
B. Route Leaks
Despite its vital role in binding together Internet networks,
BGP is missing key security features like cryptographic hard-
ening of routes exchanged between ASes or trusted certiﬁ-
cation binding ASes to owned preﬁxes. This leads to two
common classes of major inter-domain routing mishaps, pre-
ﬁx hijacking and route leaks. Preﬁx hijacks occur when a
network, often unintentionally, originates or advertises a fake
but attractive (e.g. shorter or more speciﬁc) route to preﬁxes
owned by another AS. Trafﬁc destined for those preﬁxes is
then intercepted by the hijacker. A number of recent studies
focus on hijack mitigation [39], [35], [52].
Route leaks are deﬁned in RFC 7908 as the propagation
of an advertisement beyond its intended scope [45]. Type 1-
4 leaks all cover various valley-free routing violations, i.e.
advertising one peer/provider’s routes to another peer/provider.
Because remote ASes have little or no information on rela-
tionships between non-neighboring networks, they generally
cannot distinguish leaks from valid routes, and may propagate
them throughout the topology. Type 5 leaks occur when one
provider’s routes are announced to another with the AS PATH
stripped, effectively re-originating the preﬁx from the leaker.
Finally, a Type 6 leak involves an AS announcing routes used
internally to its neighbors. These routes are often more speciﬁc
than externally announced routes; this makes the leaks more
attractive in the BGP decision process and encourages their
spread to other remote networks.
Globally disruptive route leaks occur frequently [21], [40],
[11], [27], [54], [26]. The 2019 Verizon-Cloudﬂare leak [23]
is a high proﬁle example. A small ISP, AS 33154, leaked
speciﬁc internal preﬁxes (Type 6) to Cloudﬂare and many
other destinations to its customer, AS 396531. AS 396531
committed a Type 1 leak by advertising this route to its
other provider, AS 701 Verizon. Verizon propagated the leak,
which spread widely on the control plane because it was
more speciﬁc than legitimate available routes (see depiction in
Fig. 1). Trafﬁc for Cloudﬂare, a leading content distribution
network (CDN), was funneled through small networks. Many
of the thousands of websites and services backed by Cloud-
ﬂare suffered degraded service until the leak was resolved
via out-of-band communication between Cloudﬂare and AS
33154 [48].

vices were also affected.

C. Route Leak Prevention
There are a number of tools available to assist network
operators in preventing route leaks. The Resource Public Key
Infrastructure [25] is a trusted repository for certiﬁcates that
bind IP preﬁxes to owning ASes’s public keys, called Route
Origin Authorizations (ROAs). Remote networks can validate
BGP updates against ROAs in the RPKI, a process called
Route Origin Validation (ROV). Widespread ROV ﬁltering
could prevent Type 5 (and some Type 6) leaks and many preﬁx
hijacking attacks. Unfortunately, ROA/ROV deployment has
suffered from circular deployment logic; it is meaningless for
origin ASes to invest in publishing ROAs until ROV is widely
implemented, but ROV is ineffective without ROAs. This issue
has been identiﬁed as a major obstacle to ROV deployment [8],
[12]. NIST estimates that just 20% of preﬁxes are covered by
a valid ROA [31].
3
Internet routing registries (IRRs) back another leak pre-
vention system. IRRs are databases where AS operators can
store their routing policies. Remote networks can ingest these
policies to inform ﬁlters that block unintended/invalid ad-
vertisements. IRR databases are operated by private ﬁrms,
regional Internet registries, and other interests [15], and policy
entries are often mirrored between them. A complete, up-
to-date IRR would eliminate many Type 1-4 route leaks.
Like ROV ﬁltering,
though, IRR ﬁltering is hampered by
deployment headaches. ASes’ routing policies are interdepen-
dent, so changes to one network’s stored policies can render
many others obsolete. Operators in smaller, resource-limited
networks can avoid periodic updates by conﬁguring permissive
routing policies; large transit ASes have complex, dynamic
routing policies that require frequent changes to dependent
networks’ ﬁlters [22]. These issues, combined with poor or
non-existent authentication, have resulted in inconsistent and
out-of-date IRRs. Though leading organizations like RIPE
have launched efforts to improve IRR quality [30], operator
incentive and dependency issues will continue to limit their
usefulness.
Other ﬁltering techniques include max-preﬁx limit ﬁltering,
where a network caps the number of preﬁxes it will accept
from a neighbor. This prevents mass preﬁx spills like the 2017
Level 3 leak [27], but not more targeted (yet highly disruptive)
leaks like the Verizon/Cloudﬂare incident described earlier.
BGPSec [24] is a protocol extension for cryptographic AS
path hardening. This would prevent some types of hijacking,
but BGPSec has not been commercially implemented and is
not designed to prevent route leaks.
Finally, a communities-based "down-only" (DO) leak solu-
tion has been proposed [46]. Large BGP communities [43] are
signals containing three integers that can be attached to routes.
The DO system relies on providers/peers marking a route
"down-only" using the ﬁrst two integers in a large community,
with their ASN included as the third integer, before passing the
route to customers or peers. If these customers/peers attempt
to re-advertise the route to other providers/peers, the attached
DO community will clearly signal a route leak. While this
system would prevent many leaks if properly implemented,
it relies on customers/peers preserving DO information when
propagating advertisements. Moreover, some leaks - like the
internal route leaks in the Verizon/Cloudﬂare incident - would
not be arrested by this system.
D. BGP Poisoning
BGP poisoning is a technique designed to manipulate the
BGP decision process in remote networks. ASes originating a
preﬁx can poison an advertisement by including the ASNs
of remote networks in the AS PATH. Often, the poisoned
ASNs will be inserted between copies of the origin’s ASN.
This "sandwiching" ensures trafﬁc is routed properly and that
the advertisement is valid for ROV ﬁltering purposes (see
Fig. 2). BGP prevents cycles from forming in the topology
by requiring ASes to drop routes containing their own ASN
