the user approaches the car, the key and the car perform a
secure distance bounding protocol. If the key is veriﬁed to
be within 2 m distance, the car would unlock and allow the
user to enter. In order to start the car, the car will verify if
the key is in the car. This can be done using a veriﬁable
multilateration protocol proposed in [11], which allows the
car to securely compute the location of a trusted key. Ver-
iﬁable multilateration requires that at least three verifying
nodes are placed within the car, forming a veriﬁcation tri-
angle, within which the location of the key can be securely
computed.

Low-Tech Attacks on Car Entry and Go Systems Low-
tech attacks such as lock-picking physical locks of car doors
or using hooks can be used to open a car. The hook is
pushed between the window and the door and the thief tries
to open the door by hooking the lock button or command.
However, these low-tech attacks are less reliable on new car
systems or when an alarm system is present. Lock-picking
also leaves traces which can be analyzed by a forensics in-
vestigator [15].
Cryptographic Attacks A signiﬁcant amount of research
has been performed on the cryptographic algorithms used
by remote key entry systems such as Keeloq [26, 34, 13],
TI DST [8]. Vulnerabilities are often the consequence of
too short keys, weak encryption algorithms that were not
publicly reviewed by the community or side channel weak-
nesses. Consequently, manufacturers are moving towards
more secure and well established ciphers (e.g., Atmel docu-
mentation recommends AES [30]). However, solving such
issues by moving to the best cipher to date will not solve
physical-layer relay attacks. The relay attack is indepen-
dent of the cipher used; no interpretation or manipulation of
the data is needed to perform a relay attack.
Jamming and Replay A well known attack against key-
less car opening systems is to use a simple radio jammer.
When the user step away from his car he will push the key
fob button to lock the car. If the signal is jammed, the car
won’t receive the lock signal and will therefore be left open.
If the car owner did not notice that his car didn’t lock, the
thief will be able to access it. However a jammer can not
help a thief to start the car. Another related attack is to
eavesdrop the message from the key fob and replay it (e.g.,
using on a fake reader/key pair). Standard cryptographic
protocols using a counter or a challenge-response technique
provide defense against message replay.
Part Providers Major electronic parts suppliers provide
components for PKES systems [30, 45, 33, 31], those com-
ponents are then used by various car manufacturers. Al-
though variations exists in the protocols and cryptographic
blocks (Keeloq in [31], TI DST in [45], AES in [30]),
all manufacturers provide systems based on the same com-
bined LF/UHF radio technology as we discussed in Sec-
tion 2. Therefore, those systems are likely to be impacted
by the attack we have presented.
Attacks on Keyless Systems The closest work to our in-
vestigation can be found in [6, 7]. The authors perform se-
curity analysis of Keyless Car Entry systems including relay
attacks. While the performed analysis identiﬁes the relay
problem, the proposed relay attack consists of two sepa-
rate UHF relay links to relay messages in both directions.
The proposed abstract setup has the problem of creating a
feedback loop as the car will also receive the relayed sig-
nal from the second link. We show that such a realization
is not needed in modern PKES systems and demonstrate it
experimentally. Moreover, the authors do not provide nei-
ther hardware design, nor practical implementation of the
attack. Finally, no adequate countermeasures are proposed.
Some practical attacks on PKES systems have been re-
cently reported [4]. However, no detailed information is
available and it is not possible to understand the details of

tion/demodulation relay or on a physical-layer relay attack.
Moreover, it is impossible to verify the reported claims and
if the attack is indeed real.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we showed that the introduction of PKES
systems raises serious concerns for the security of car ac-
cess and authorization to drive systems. We demonstrated
on 10 cars from different manufacturers that PKES systems
in some modern cars are vulnerable to relay attacks. This
attack allows an attacker to open the car and start the engine
by placing one antenna near the key holder and a second
antenna close to the car. We demonstrated the feasibility
of this attack using both wired and wireless setups. Our at-
tack works for a speciﬁc set of PKES systems that we tested
and whose operation is described in this paper. However,
given the generality of the relay attack, it is likely that PKES
systems based on similar designs are also vulnerable to the
same attack.
We analyzed critical time characteristics in order to bet-
ter quantify systems’ behavior. We proposed simple coun-
termeasures that minimize the risk of relay attacks and
that can be immediately deployed by the car owners; how-
ever, these countermeasures also disable the operation of
the PKES systems. Finally, we discussed recent solutions
against relay attacks that preserve convenience of use for
which PKES systems were initially introduced.
