User: I have a python script on a Raspberry Pi reading the temperature and humidity from a sensor. It works fine when started in IDLE, but when I try starting it in a terminal I get the message:sudo: unable to execute .thermostaatgui.py: No such file or directory. The first line in the script is: #! /usr/bin/python, the same as in other scripts that run without problems and the script is made executable with chmod +x.
In the script Adafruit_DHT, datetime and time are imported, other scripts that work do the same.
Assistant: +1 on the above solution. 
To Debug
try this
Type "pwd" on your terminal. This will tell you where you are in the shell. 
Then type "ls -lah" and look for your script. if you can not find it, then you need to "cd" to the directory where the script exists and then execute the script
