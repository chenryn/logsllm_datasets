## Abstract
We propose new techniques to combat click fraud in pay-per-click (PPC) systems. Instead of filtering out seemingly fraudulent clicks, our approach only accepts legitimate clicks validated through client authentication. This system supports a new advertising model where "premium" validated clicks have higher value than ordinary clicks. Click validation relies on sites sharing evidence of user legitimacy, distinguishing them from bots, scripts, or fraudsters. To address privacy concerns, we propose methods to make the authentication process anonymous. Our premium-click scheme is transparent to users, requiring no client-side changes and minimal overhead for participating websites.

## Introduction
Pay-per-click (PPC) metering is a popular payment model for online advertising. Advertisers contract with syndicators (e.g., Google, Yahoo) to distribute banner ads to publishers. When a user clicks on an ad, they are directed to the advertiser's website. Syndicators charge advertisers for these clicks and share a portion of the revenue with publishers.

A server observes a "click" as a browser request for a URL associated with an ad. It cannot determine if a human initiated the action or if the intent was honest. Syndicators typically filter fraudulent clicks based on various heuristics. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach: authenticating valid clicks rather than filtering out bad ones. We refer to these validated clicks as "premium clicks."

Our scheme involves a new entity, the "attestor," which provides cryptographic credentials for clients performing qualifying actions (e.g., purchases). These credentials help the syndicator distinguish premium clicks from general traffic, enhancing fraud detection.

## 2. Problem Overview and Related Work
Click fraud exploits the lack of verifiable human engagement in PPC requests to fabricate ad traffic. Forms of click fraud include:
- Automated scripts or bots simulating clicks.
- Malware-infected computers generating clicks.
- Low-wage workers clicking for a living (click-farms).
- Deceptive practices that trick users into clicking ads.
- Unintentional clicks caused by malicious scripts.

Click fraud can benefit fraudsters by:
- Inflating publisher revenue.
- Increasing competitors' advertising costs (denial-of-service attack).
- Manipulating ad rankings and keyword prices.

Syndicators can temporarily profit from click fraud but face long-term risks, such as losing advertiser trust. They currently use heuristic filters to detect suspicious clicks, but these are limited against sophisticated fraudsters.

## 3. Structural Overview
### Authentication
Our premium-click scheme uses cryptographic attestations (coupons) to authenticate requests. Coupons can be implemented using cache cookies, which are more practical and less likely to be blocked by users compared to traditional cookies.

### Key Aspects
1. **Pedigree:** Attestors identify and label clients that appear legitimate. For example, a retail site might classify a client as legitimate if they have made at least $50 in purchases.
2. **Traffic Caps:** The scheme validates clicks from clients that have not generated excessive traffic, indicating possible malicious activity.

### Architecture
In a traditional PPC model, a user clicking on a banner triggers a transaction recorded by the syndicator. In our premium-click model, additional steps are introduced:
- **Marking:** An attestor identifies a legitimate client and embeds a coupon in their browser.
- **Click/Coupon Release:** When the user clicks on an ad, the coupon is released to the syndicator.
- **Coupon Checking:** The syndicator verifies the coupon and checks for overuse.
- **Reward:** If the coupon is valid, the syndicator pays the publisher.

### Challenges
- **Secure Validation:** Ensuring that adversaries cannot impersonate premium clients or forge clicks.
- **Privacy Protection:** Preventing syndicators from tracking clients or learning their identities.

## 4. A Premium-Click Scheme
### Ideal Scenario
In a world with perfect transparency, syndicators could easily identify and manage click fraud. However, our scheme aims for partial knowledge and uses the browser as a carrier of information.

### Steps
1. **Marking:** The attestor caches a coupon in the client's browser.
2. **Click/Coupon Release:** The browser releases the coupon when the user clicks on an ad.
3. **Coupon Checking:** The syndicator verifies the coupon and checks for overuse.
4. **Reward:** The syndicator pays the publisher if the coupon is valid.

### Technical Foundations
#### Coupon Caching
Cache cookies, particularly TIF-based, are the preferred medium for coupons. They are set for third-party sites and can be released to the syndicator by any visited site.

#### Coupon Authentication
Coupons must be cryptographically authenticated to prevent fraud. Message-authentication codes (MACs) are used instead of digital signatures due to their lower computational cost.

**Example:**
- Attestor \( A \) and syndicator \( S \) share a symmetric key \( k \).
- A coupon \( \gamma = m \parallel M AC_k(m) \) is created, where \( m \) is unique to the client's visit.
- Only the syndicator can verify the MAC, ensuring the coupon's authenticity.
