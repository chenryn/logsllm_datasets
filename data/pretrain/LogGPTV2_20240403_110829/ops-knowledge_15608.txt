User: I was wondering if anyone knew a code fix to the pstorm python script where you could exclude directories from being indexed in a directory when you open it from the command line.
I know this is not currently a feature in the IDE but maybe there is a work around someone knows of.
Thanks
Assistant: Use Settings | File Types | Ignore Files and Folders to exclude directories by name or pattern.
