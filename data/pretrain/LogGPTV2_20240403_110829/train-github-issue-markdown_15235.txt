Hi,
I think that interp1d should be more verbose when extrapolating out of bounds,
for example using warnings. The code itself poses the question, and answers
"matlab does not".
I vote yes :)
Seriously, Extrapolating can be fine, I do that a lot in order to avoid
crashes when one/two points are out of the allowed interpolation, but I would
love to be warned if data are being extrapolated.
