#### Introduction
We demonstrate that IP is not the sole layer to consider in load-balanced networks (see Section 3). Path diversity can be present at lower layers, such as through Link Aggregation Groups (LAG) or Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). Additionally, by using the Round-Trip Time (RTT) distribution instead of the minimum observation, we show that ping is a poor estimator for any metric related to RTT. Essentially, ping systematically overestimates RTT variability, which is significantly lower when measured for individual flow identifiers.

#### Previous Efforts
Previous research has focused on improving per-flow load balancing. For example, the MPLS entropy label [10] aims to avoid deep packet inspection by routers, enabling high traffic rates in core routers. [20] highlights the challenges in hashing encapsulated traffic. The impact of different hash functions on traffic balancing across multiple links is studied in [4], and best practices for optimal LAG/ECMP component link utilization with hash-based techniques are described in [11]. In [21], the use of specific paths in data centers, such as to avoid congestion, is achieved by modifying packet headers based on traceroute-like results.

#### Key Findings
We show that predictability is a crucial feature for new load balancing methods, especially for ease of diagnosis. From this perspective, the load balancing technique proposed in [6] is particularly interesting. Traffic balancing is of major importance as it is commonly used in ISP networks [1, 8] and data centers [9, 12].

### Lessons Learned
We have shown that using ping for delay measurement can be biased if one ignores flow-based load balancing. This bias is intrinsic to ping's design and is predictable. In carefully crafted measurements, the dispersion reported by ping can be up to 40% of the RTT experienced by the flow with the lowest latency. In other words, high variability in ping delay measurements is likely an artifact of the tool itself.

This observation has several implications:

1. **Ping is Unsuitable for Measuring RTT Distributions**: The distribution measured by ping is often a sample from a wider set of per-flow distributions. While this can identify upper and lower bounds for delay with good approximation, it provides a mediocre estimate for delay. It overestimates jitter (or any other metric measuring the variability of the distribution). Therefore, it cannot reliably represent the performance experienced by applications. This should serve as a warning for researchers studying end-to-end Internet performance and operators using ping for measurement or debugging purposes. We suggest deploying tokyo-ping, an adaptation of paris-traceroute, on large-scale measurement infrastructures.

2. **Importance of Flow Identifiers**: Significant differences in latency may exist between flows for the same source and destination pair, representing both a danger and an opportunity for applications. Applications using multiple transport channels, such as videoconferencing and streaming, cannot assume consistent network performance across channels. Multi-channel applications should not rely on a single control channel to accurately estimate delay and jitter of all opened TCP connections. If consistency across channels (e.g., for lip sync in video streaming) is required, SCTP [18] is a good alternative as it can multiplex streams while maintaining a constant flow identifier. Additionally, our findings suggest that accurately monitoring per-channel performance from outside the application is more challenging than commonly believed.

#### Impact on Common Wisdom and Prior Work
Our findings highlight the complexity of reality, where technologies and configurations at different layers of the protocol stack often interact in unexpected ways. Understanding these interactions and the behavior of different vendor implementations is difficult and can lead to inaccurate modeling. Our experiments show that, in some cases, latency over a network path is not a well-defined concept, and we should more precisely define latency over a transport session. We recommend that researchers exercise caution when drawing conclusions from experiments based solely on ping results.
