On Material UI Next, the Select component behaves different from Material UI
0.19.  
On the old version, you could open the select box, and type to select an
option, then press enter to select the option.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Opening the select box and typing one of the valid options should highlight
said option and pressing enter should select it.
## Current Behavior
Typing / pressing enter doesn't select anything, but it used to work under
Material UI 0.19
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. https://material-ui.com/demos/selects/
  2. Click on Age
  3. Type "Twenty" and press enter
  4. Try the same thing on the Native Select component below.
  5. Do the same steps on http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/select-field (It works here)
## Context
This small feature help users with navigation / selecting. It's expected
behaviour in that component.
## Your Environment
It doesn't really matter, you can replicate on the Material UI Next website.
