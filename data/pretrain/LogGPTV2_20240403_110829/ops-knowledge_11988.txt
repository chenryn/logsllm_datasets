User: I develop Python3 on GNU/Linux, but my system has two interpreters installed:

python2 -> /usr/bin/python
python3 -> /usr/bin/python3

(AFAIK: This is normal on a Linux box, other installed applications frequently depend upon different versions of Python: either 2 or 3.)
When I create new virtual environments for Python3, I notice the $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin folder has (at least) two python binaries:

$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python3 -> copied from /usr/bin/python3
$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python-> symlink to $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python3

I don't want the python symlink, as it hides my Python2 interpreter in /usr/bin/python.
Is there a way to disable the creation of symlink python in the new Python3 virtual environment?
(For the time being, I run virtualenv, then manually delete $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python myself.)
Assistant: The purpose of the virtual env is to allow the use of required version as default. That's why you see the symbolic link created. 
If you want both (i.e no symbolic link python -> /usr/bin/python3) then do not create virtual env
