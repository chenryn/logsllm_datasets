User: How to search for specific files in different folders using Linux command line tools?
Assistant: On the Linux command line, you can use the "find" command to search for specific files in different folders. Its basic syntax is as follows: ``` find [path] [option] [expression] ``` Among them, "path" specifies the starting directory to be searched (the default is the current directory), "option" and "expression" are used To specify the search criteria, such as file name, type, size, etc. Here are some commonly used example commands: - Search for a file named "filename" in the current directory and all subdirectories: ``` find . -name filename ``` - Search for all types in the specified directory and its subdirectories For ".txt" files, and display the file size and path: ``` find /path/to/directory -type f -name "*.txt" -printf "%s %p\n" ``` - in Search for all directories whose names start with "test" in the current directory and its subdirectories: ``` find . -type d -name "test*" ``` More options and expressions can be viewed with the "man find" command.
