Like Python, Julia's `zip(a, b)` ignores the tail end of its input sequences
when they are of unequal length (but see #17928). I've yet to encounter a
problem where I wanted that behavior, and I would much prefer seeing an error
when the inputs are of unequal length. Are there applications where truncation
is very convenient?
