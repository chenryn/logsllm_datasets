Similar to Python, Julia's `zip(a, b)` function truncates the longer sequence when the input sequences have different lengths (though you may want to refer to issue #17928 for more context). In my experience, I have not encountered a situation where this behavior is desirable. Instead, I would prefer that an error be raised when the input sequences are of unequal length. 

Are there specific applications or use cases where the current truncation behavior is particularly convenient or advantageous?
