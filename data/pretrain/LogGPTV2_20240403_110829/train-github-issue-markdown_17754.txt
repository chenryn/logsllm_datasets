**Apache Airflow version** : 1.10.9
**Kubernetes version: 1.15.11
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider** : Google Cloud
**What happened** :
I started to notice that Airflow webserver performance degrades over time. At
one moment all my webserver pods had 100% CPU used, so UI and API became too
slow, even unusable.  
I started to investigate this issue and looks like it depends on amount of
task instances stored in DB. I had 100,000+ of them in the task_instance
table. When I checked what process took full CPU on webserver pods, that was a
gunicorn. After I cleaned up task_instance table, CPU usage dropped to
nothing. Right now I have 30,000 tasks completed and see CPU spikes again.

Also this issue seems to go away if I disable all my DAGs. Looks like
webserver has some query which executes from time to time and consumes all the
CPU.
**What you expected to happen** :
Amount of completed tasks do not influence the webserver performance.
**How to reproduce it** :
Generate 100,000 tasks and have 10 enabled DAGs in Airflow. Webserver CPU
usage will be high, web becomes unusable.
