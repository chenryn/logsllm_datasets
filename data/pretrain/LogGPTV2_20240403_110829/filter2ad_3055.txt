ABSTRACT 
The  focus  of  this  workshop  is  the  application  of  scientific 
practices  to  cyber  security  research.  The  objective  of  this 
workshop is examine the implementation of science practices in 
cyber  defense  research  and  understand  the  ramification  of 
tradeoffs  between  simplifications  to  obtain interpretable  results 
vs. observational studies of systems in the wild where the results 
can  lead  to  ambiguous  interpretations.  The  research  papers 
accepted  addressed  a  wide  variety of  technical  questions in  the 
cyber domain and the maturity of the work spanned the range of 
initial ideas and proofs of concept to mature work that is ready 
for  operational  implementation.  Papers  were  evaluated  for  the 
reproducibility of the work as represented by the documentation 
of methods and testing environments.

1  INTRODUCTION 
Recently, there has been a great deal of interest about the science 
of  cybersecurity1,2,3,4.    In  order  to  be  considered  scientific,  the 
processes  from  concept  through  testing  must  follow  a  series  of 
steps to ensure repeatable, reproducible and therefore verifiable 
results.   
These steps include: 
  Define a tractable problem. 
Ensure falsifiability

  Obtain ground truth 
  Document assumptions and test them 
  Assess progress to the larger problem 
Start with simple experiments 
Upon  completing  this  cycle,  the  process  repeats  with  previous 
results incorporated into the problem and assumptions. 
The  focus  of  this  workshop  is  the  application  of  scientific 
practices  to  cyber  security  research.  The  objective  of  this 
workshop is examine the implementation of science practices in 
cyber  defense  research  and  understand  the  ramification  of 
tradeoffs  between  simplifications  to  obtain interpretable  results 
vs. observational studies of systems in the wild where the results 
can lead to ambiguous interpretations. 
2  TOPICS 
This workshop will consist of papers, presentations, and a panel 
discussing cyber security research and the means of applying the 
scientific processes to that research.  To obtain a broad swath of 
areas  in  which  these  process  could  be  applied,  the  following 
topics are of interest of this workshop: 
  Configuration 
evaluation.;  
testing, 
forensics, 
debugging 
and 
  Continuous monitoring and response; 
  Cyber resiliency, agility and moving target defense; 
  Cost effectiveness; 
  Resilience/ agility effectiveness; 
  Testbeds; 
  Research Infrastructure; 
  Verification techniques; 
  Validation techniques; 
  Testing & evaluation methods; 
  Cyber-physical systems security; 
  Security configuration verification and economics; 
  Security metrics including adversarial and user measures; 
  Security policy management; 
  Theory of defense-of-depth; 
  Mission  metrics  to  include  mission  assurance,  mission 
measures, and conflicting mission management.

The  workshop  will  consist  of  a  combination  of  peer-reviewed 
and invited papers, a keynote presentation and a panel.   
The  keynote  presentation  will  be  given  by  Dr.  William  (Bill) 
Sanders.    Bill  is  the  Department  Head  of  the  Electrical  and 
Computer  Engineering  Department  at  the  University  of  Illinois 
at  Urbana/Champaign. 
  His  presentation  will  discuss  the 
processes in going from good science to good engineering in the 
context  of  cyber  security  and  cyber  resilience.    The  panel  will 
consist of Bill and professors from University of Texas at Dallas, 
the  University  of  Colorado  at  Boulder,  and  at  least  one  other 
panellist to be named shortly.  In addition, each of the panellist 
will present their introductory remarks as invited talks. 
The remainder of the program will consist of 15 and 30 minute 
presentations  by  the  authors  of  accepted  papers.    Full  papers 
authors  will receive the  30  minutes  each  while  the  short  paper 
authors will get 15 minutes each.
