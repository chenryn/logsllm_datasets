Hello,

I have two questions regarding Glide:

1. **How can I clear the cache for a specific URL?**
   - The methods `clearDiskCache()` and `clearMemory()` clear all the cache, but I only want to clear the cache for a particular URL. How can I achieve this?

2. **How can I retrieve a Bitmap using Glide?**
   - Could you please provide guidance on how to obtain a Bitmap from an image URL using Glide?

Thank you for your help.
