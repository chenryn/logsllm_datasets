Question: A development team is working on an application for iOS 9 and macOS 10.11 platforms. They need to ensure their app's network connections are secure by default using App Transport Security (ATS) and that the app adheres to the latest IPv6 security recommendations. What measures must they implement to comply with ATS's default connection requirements and IPv6 security for Apple operating systems?
"A": "Support for TLS 1.2, ensuring forward secrecy, and using certificates signed with SHA256 or stronger with at least 2048-bit RSA key or 256-bit elliptic curve key.",
"B": "Allowing only ECDHE_ECDSA_AES and ECDHE_RSA_AES in CBC mode, and performing OCSP for all certificates regardless of the number of revocations.",
"C": "Use of temporary IPv6 addresses with a preferred lifetime of 48 hours for new connections and incorporating the networkâ€™s SSID into the address generation for Wi-Fi networks.",
"D": "Generating IPv6 addresses using cryptographically generated addresses as per RFC 3972, and ensuring that different interfaces on the same network have different addresses."
Answer: AD
