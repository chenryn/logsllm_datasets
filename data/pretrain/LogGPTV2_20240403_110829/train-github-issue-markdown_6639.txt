After upgrading to VSCode 0.10.6 I've been getting IntelliSense suggestions
when writing a line comment (starting the line with //) in C# projects. I use
VScode for developing Unity3D projects on OSX 10.11.2.
It's an understatement to call it annoying when I write e.g. "will do" and
"do" auto completes to a full do...while loop.
