such messages by attempting to make many calls; every 15 sec-
onds, we dial and immediately hang up before the call is answered.
This lasts for 10 hours. We deliver 42.4 MB control messages in
total, but none is charged in the data bill. Moreover, no minutes are
charged since no call is made through.
We further examine fake signals bypassing the server are still
free. We test it with the VoLTE-to-VoLTE internal case in Figure 5.
In an experimental run, we send 5000 ICMP Echo Requests (each
carrying 1 KB) and receive 4914 ICMP Echo Replies; The trafﬁc is
about 10 MB (both uplink and downlink), but neither volume-based
nor time-based billing is incurred. Similar results are observed in
other test runs.
Causes and lessons.
There is nothing wrong to practice the
policy of free VoLTE signaling. However, people do have incen-
tives to exploit any transfer that is free. This requires either bullet-
proof access control or no free-of-charge policy, or both. Com-
pared with another free data access via DNS tunneling disclosed
in [23], VoLTE signaling faces more challenges. It aims to continue
the traditional business model and VoLTE accounting only logs the
time duration for the data-plane voice. The 4G gateway executes
volume-based accounting for data access, but does not record the
usage volume for the VoLTE signaling bearer.
3.3 Manipulating Data Access Priority
Unsurprisingly, the VoLTE-exploited data access can obtain higher,
yet underserved priority. The high priority is assigned to provide
QoS for VoLTE. However, the expedited delivery at high priority
hurts normal PS data services, particularly during network conges-
tion.
V4: Abusing high QoS of VoLTE Signaling
A prominent feature of VoLTE is its capability to guarantee high
quality for voice calls. Table 2 lists relevant bearer conﬁgurations
speciﬁed in the 3GPP standard [7]. Each bearer is associated with
a QoS class of identiﬁer (QCI), which deﬁnes the IP packet char-
acteristics in terms of priority level, bandwidth guarantee, packet
delay and loss. The VoLTE signaling bearer has highest priority
level (i.e., 1) whereas the data bearer (e.g., web, video streaming)
has the lowest one (i.e., 9). VoLTE-exploited data access can fur-
ther suppress normal PS data with preemptive privileges. Note that
both belong to the non-guaranteed bit rate category, whereas the
voice bearer with QCI = 1 has guaranteed bit rate (GBR). GBR
states that the bearer is granted dedicated network resources over
both radio and wired links and assured voice quality by ensuring
the average rate given a period of time. This will be exploited later
in §4.1.
Empirical validation. We validate it through two compara-
tive experiments: (1) During a long-lived downlink data session
(10Mbps), we launch another VoLTE-exploited data access. The
source rate is larger than the affordable downlink throughput (30 Mbps)
and lasts between the 15th second to 45th (Figure 6a); (2) We
swap the launch ordering for normal data session and the VoLTE-
exploited one (Figure 6b). It is seen that the VoLTE-exploited data

(b) Non-preemptive ordinary data access

exploited data access (15s,45s) suppresses the ordinary PS data,
(b) PS data can not affect VoLTE-exploited data access
access has higher priority, thus suppressing the normal one with
preemptive privileges. The data bearer throughput rapidly shrinks
to zero when the downlink resource is captured by the signaling
bearer. On the contrary, the data session cannot affect the through-
put of the signaling bearer. It can only grab the remaining resource
and its peak throughput is throttled.
Causes and lessons.
Similar to V3, nothing seems to be wrong
for the operator to offer higher QoS to VoLTE. However, without
prudent trafﬁc ﬁltering, it likely becomes an incentive for the ad-
versary to exploit VoLTE.
3.4 Proof-of-concept Attacks
We devise three proof-of-concept attacks: (1) free data service;
(2) data DoS; (3) data overcharging. They are illustrated in the top,
middle, and bottom of Figure 7, respectively. The ﬁrst one works
for both operators, whereas the last two are feasible for only OP-I.
All are easily launched and also damaging. Note that the last two
attacks do not require root privilege at the victims.
Free-data attack. Clearly, the above loopholes can be exploited
to gain free external (Mobile-to-Internet) and internal (Mobile-to-
Mobile) data access. Note that the free external service works for
only OP-I, but the free internal service is feasible for both. Take
the OP-I as an example. The attacks work as follows. The adver-
sary leverages ICMP tunneling to deliver data through the signal-
ing bearer, since the ICMP packets are always allowed to be for-
warded by the 4G gateway to the Internet or another mobile phone.
Each data packet is encapsulated as an ICMP packet by using Raw
Socket. Moreover, the routing table needs to be updated with the
routing rules of designated destinations, so the ICMP packet can be
sent via the signaling bearer to the destinations. These two opera-
tions can only be performed on a rooted phone. In the external case,
we deploy a tunneling server out of mobile networks to run ICMP
tunneling. In the internal case, the ICMP tunneling is between two
VoLTE phones.
We test with various trafﬁc source rates (up to 16 Mbps) and
execution time (up to 10 hours) for both cases. Figure 8 shows that

no sign of limit exhibits on the volume, throughput, and duration
for free data service in the external and internal cases, respectively.
In a test run, 450MB is observed free of charge.
Data DoS Attack.
This attack aims to shut down any ongo-
ing data service at the victim by leveraging higher-priority access
yielded by VoLTE-exploited data transfer. The attacker injects high-
rate spamming trafﬁc through its signaling bearer, to the victim
phone’s signaling bearer. It can grab all the downlink bandwidth
of the victim’s data service, thereby causing data DoS. Note that
the attacker and the victim are not charged on this spamming traf-
ﬁc, which is carried by the signaling bearers.
This requires an unprivileged malware on the victim device, which
detects whether any data service starts, similar to the off-path TCP
hijack attack [27, 28]. Once the victim starts any data service, this
malware will send a message to an attacker server or an attack
phone, leaking the IP address of the VoLTE interface. Afterwards,
the attacker starts to inject high-rate spamming data to this IP. In the
cases of rush-hour trafﬁc (e.g., 11am-1pm at a campus restaurant),
it is observed that the data bearer throughput can be restrained to be
zero, under a 10Mbps VoLTE-exploited ﬂow. Note that the required
volume of the VoLTE-exploited ﬂow for data DoS varies with the
trafﬁc load of the network where the victim is.
Overcharging Attack.
The attacker can make the victim suf-
fer excessive overcharge through injecting data from its signaling
bearer into the victim phone’s data-service bearer. There is only
one difference from the above DoS attack. The DoS attack spams
data toward the victim phone’s signaling bearer. The chosen victim
