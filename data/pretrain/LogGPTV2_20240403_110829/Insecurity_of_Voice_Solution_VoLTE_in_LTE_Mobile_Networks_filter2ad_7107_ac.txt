### Bearer QoS Configurations

| Bearer Type | Delay (ms) | Bit Rate (GBR/Non-GBR) | Traffic Example | Loss |
|-------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------|------|
| Guaranteed  | 100        | GBR: 150               | VoLTE calls     | 10^-2 |
|             |            | Non-GBR: 300           | Video call      | 10^-3 |
|             |            |                        | VoLTE signaling | 10^-6 |
|             |            |                        | Web, Email, etc.| 10^-6 |

### Exploitation of Free VoLTE Signaling

To test the free nature of VoLTE signaling, we attempted to make numerous calls, dialing and immediately hanging up every 15 seconds for a total duration of 10 hours. This process generated 42.4 MB of control messages, but no data or call charges were incurred.

We further verified that fake signals bypassing the server remain free. In an experiment, we sent 5000 ICMP Echo Requests (each carrying 1 KB) and received 4914 ICMP Echo Replies, resulting in approximately 10 MB of traffic (both uplink and downlink). Neither volume-based nor time-based billing was applied. Similar results were observed in other test runs.

**Causes and Lessons:**
While offering free VoLTE signaling is not inherently problematic, it can be exploited by malicious users. To mitigate this, robust access control measures or a no-free-of-charge policy should be implemented. Compared to DNS tunneling [23], VoLTE signaling faces additional challenges as it aims to maintain traditional business models, with accounting only logging the time duration for data-plane voice. The 4G gateway performs volume-based accounting for data access but does not record usage volume for VoLTE signaling bearers.

### Manipulating Data Access Priority

VoLTE-exploited data access can achieve higher, yet undeserved, priority. This high priority is intended to provide QoS for VoLTE, but it can negatively impact normal PS data services, especially during network congestion.

**V4: Abusing High QoS of VoLTE Signaling**

A key feature of VoLTE is its ability to ensure high-quality voice calls. Table 2 lists relevant bearer configurations specified in the 3GPP standard [7]. Each bearer is associated with a QoS Class Identifier (QCI), which defines IP packet characteristics in terms of priority level, bandwidth guarantee, packet delay, and loss. The VoLTE signaling bearer has the highest priority (QCI = 1), while the data bearer (e.g., web, video streaming) has the lowest (QCI = 9). VoLTE-exploited data access can suppress normal PS data with preemptive privileges. Note that both belong to the non-guaranteed bit rate category, whereas the voice bearer with QCI = 1 has a guaranteed bit rate (GBR).

**Empirical Validation:**
We validated this through two comparative experiments:
1. During a long-lived downlink data session (10 Mbps), we launched another VoLTE-exploited data access. The source rate exceeded the affordable downlink throughput (30 Mbps) and lasted from the 15th to the 45th second (Figure 6a).
2. We swapped the launch ordering for the normal data session and the VoLTE-exploited one (Figure 6b). The results showed that the VoLTE-exploited data access had higher priority, suppressing the normal data session with preemptive privileges. The data bearer throughput rapidly dropped to zero when the downlink resource was captured by the signaling bearer, while the data session could not affect the signaling bearer's throughput.

**Causes and Lessons:**
Similar to V3, providing higher QoS for VoLTE is not inherently wrong, but without prudent traffic filtering, it can be exploited. Robust traffic management is essential to prevent such abuses.

### Proof-of-Concept Attacks

We devised three proof-of-concept attacks:
1. **Free Data Service:** Exploits loopholes to gain free external (Mobile-to-Internet) and internal (Mobile-to-Mobile) data access. The free external service works for OP-I, while the free internal service is feasible for both operators.
2. **Data DoS Attack:** Shuts down ongoing data services at the victim by leveraging higher-priority access yielded by VoLTE-exploited data transfer.
3. **Overcharging Attack:** Makes the victim suffer excessive overcharges by injecting data from the attacker's signaling bearer into the victim's data-service bearer.

**Free-Data Attack:**
The adversary uses ICMP tunneling to deliver data through the signaling bearer, as ICMP packets are always allowed by the 4G gateway. Each data packet is encapsulated as an ICMP packet using Raw Socket, and the routing table is updated with the necessary rules. For the external case, a tunneling server is deployed outside the mobile network. For the internal case, ICMP tunneling is between two VoLTE phones.

**Data DoS Attack:**
The attacker injects high-rate spamming traffic through the signaling bearer to the victim's signaling bearer, causing data DoS. This requires unprivileged malware on the victim's device to detect and report any data service initiation. The attacker then injects high-rate spamming data to the victim's IP address.

**Overcharging Attack:**
The attacker injects data from their signaling bearer into the victim's data-service bearer, leading to excessive overcharges. The main difference from the DoS attack is the target bearer.

**Empirical Results:**
Tests with various traffic source rates (up to 16 Mbps) and execution times (up to 10 hours) showed that the volume of free data almost linearly increased with traffic source rate and run time in both external and internal cases. In one test, 450 MB of data was observed free of charge.
