Question: In Android Keymaster, a private key is configured with the `TAG::USER_SECURE_ID` but without additional authentication tags. What does this indicate about the key's usage and what are the potential trade-offs?
"A": "The key can be used without user authentication, and the trade-off is increased usability at the expense of security.",
"B": "User authentication is required for every use of the key, offering higher security but potentially reducing convenience.",
"C": "The key is restricted to a single user but does not require authentication, which simplifies access but may allow unauthorized use if the device is compromised.",
"D": "The key will only operate during a specified timeout period after user authentication, balancing security with usability."
Answer: B
