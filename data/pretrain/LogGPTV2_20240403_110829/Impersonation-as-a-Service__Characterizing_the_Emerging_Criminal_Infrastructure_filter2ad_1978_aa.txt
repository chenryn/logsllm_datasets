ABSTRACT
In this paper we provide evidence of an emerging criminal infras-
tructure enabling impersonation attacks at scale. Impersonation-as-
a-Service (IMPaaS) allows attackers to systematically collect and
enforce user profiles (consisting of user credentials, cookies, de-
vice and behavioural fingerprints, and other metadata) to circum-
vent risk-based authentication system and effectively bypass multi-
factor authentication mechanisms. We present the IMPaaS model
and evaluate its implementation by analysing the operation of a
large, invite-only, Russian IMPaaS platform providing user pro-
files for more than 260′000 Internet users worldwide. Our findings
suggest that the IMPaaS model is growing, and provides the mecha-
nisms needed to systematically evade authentication controls across
multiple platforms, while providing attackers with a reliable, up-to-
date, and semi-automated environment enabling target selection
and user impersonation against Internet users as scale.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years there has been a surge in criminal infrastructures
supporting cyberattacks and cybercrime activities at large [2, 10, 20].
For example, exploitation-as-a-service and pay-per-install provide
a set of attack technologies generally aimed at infecting systems
or controlling bots that are then employed to launch, for example,
DDoS attacks, or subsequent malware and phishing campaigns (e.g.,
to harvest credit card numbers or steal credentials). An important
problem in any venture, let alone a criminal one, is the ability to
systematically monetize the effort that goes into it [22]. In criminal
enterprises, monetization is not necessarily an easy feat: whereas
re-selling or giving access to infected systems to fellow criminals
alleviates the problem for whom generates the infection (e.g., the
bot herder [5, 26]), the problem of assigning a price to each bot
remains [3]. Whereas the dynamics of demand and offer in the
underground are likely to play a role in this setting (and remain
an important open question to investigate in this domain), another
key factor in determining the value of an infected system is the
information it manages and/or processes; for example, access to the
email account(s) of an Internet user may have a different value, to
attackers, than access to a user profile with a server-stored credit
card number (e.g., an e-commerce website). On the other hand, it
is not yet clear how (and if) attackers can systematically employ
those credentials to impersonate Internet users at large, particularly
in the presence of multi-factor authentication systems whereby a
username and password alone are not sufficient to gain access to
an Internet account.
Credential theft and re-selling in underground communities have
been studied multiple times in the literature; for example, recent
studies provide an in-depth view of what happens to credentials
after they have been stolen [35], and their employment for final
attacks [40]. Similarly, several studies investigate the attack vec-
tors that allow attackers to obtain the credentials in the first place,
ranging from (targeted) phishing and phishing kits, to malware
infections at scale [8, 9, 35]. On the other hand, a systematic em-
ployment of the stolen credentials remains out of reach for most
attackers: credentials stolen from the underground may be accessed
by multiple criminals, effectively destroying their value for later
accesses [22]; similarly, the effort required to monetize access to
stolen or hijacked user accounts does not scale well with the number
of available accounts [22, 23]. In particular, protection systems such
as multi-factor and risk-based authentication systems severely limit
the capabilities of attackers to effectively employ stolen credentials,
requiring the employment to more sophisticated attack vectors than
a simple credentials dump [40]. Risk-based authentication systems
receive user authentication requests and are responsible to decide
whether additional multi-factor authentication is required for that
session, or if the provided (valid) password suffices to grant access
to the user requesting it. The idea behind risk-based authentication
is that, by ‘measuring’ certain characteristics of the user environ-
ment (i.e., its fingerprint [1]), the authenticating system can build a
‘risk profile’ associated to that request as a function of the distance
between the current fingerprint and the profile associated to the
requesting user. If the mismatch is too large, the risk-based authen-
tication system will defer the decision to a multi-factor mechanism
(e.g., requesting a code sent to a trusted device or account, such as a
mobile phone or an email account); on the other hand, if no anom-
aly in the user profile is detected, the risk-based authentication
system will – in most cases – grant access just with the password.
This mechanism is a significant obstacle to a successful imperson-
ation attack, as the very high dimensionality of a user fingerprint
makes it impossible, for an attacker, to systematically reproduce it
for arbitrary users from scratch [1, 40]. A recent study by Thomas
et al. [40] highlights how modern phishing kits [34] are equipped
with fingerprinting modules that, together with the user credentials,
obtain a measurement of the user’s environment that can be re-used
to circumvent risk-based systems. On the other hand, obtaining
these user profiles require systematic efforts to phish targets, per-
haps across different platforms, and may not provide reliable and
stable measures of a user’s fingerprint as the victim’s interaction
with the attacker website may not accurately reflect the victim’s
interaction with the legitimate website (e.g., for behavioural fin-
gerprinting [12, 38]). Overall, traditional attack strategies seem
unsuitable to reliably obtain, update, and enforce user profiles.
In this paper we provide evidence of a new emerging criminal
infrastructure for Impersonation-as-a-Service, that relies on custom
malware and a marketplace platform to systematize the delivery of
complete user profiles to attackers. A user profile on an IMPaaS ser-
vice comes complete with stolen credentials for multiple platforms,
the ability to either reproduce or re-generate a user fingerprint
from the stolen data, and a software bundle to enforce the user
profile during an authentication session. To study the presence
of the IMPaaS model in the wild, we provide an in-depth analysis
of a large criminal platform (ImpaaS.ru) providing, at the time
of writing, more than 260′000 profiles of Internet users, globally.
ImpaaS.ru is an emerging, invite-only, Russian IMPaaS platform
currently operating in the underground. To evaluate the nature
of IMPaaS operations, we dissect the process behind the acquisi-
tion, selection, and enforcement of stolen user profiles enabled by
the IMPaaS model, and provide a detailed evaluation of the char-
acteristics of ImpaaS.ru, its extension, the characteristics of the
user profiles it provides to final attackers, and the relative effect of
different user profile characteristics on its value.
three-fold:
Scope and contribution. The contribution of this paper is
• we provide the first characterization of the IMPaaS model
for the systematization of impersonation attacks at scale;
• we provide an evaluation of a large, invite-only, emergent
Russian IMPaaS platform that automates the collection, pro-
vision and enforcement of user profiles collected worldwide;
• we provide insights on the relative effects of different user
profile characteristics on the value of the user profile, and
quantify these effects.
A detailed technical analysis of the malware for the user profile
exfiltration and enforcement is out of the scope of the present paper.
This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 set the background for
impersonation attacks and their relation to existent countermea-
sures; Section 3 introduces the IMPaaS model for impersonation
attacks at scale, and Section 4 describes the ImpaaS.ru marketplace
implementing it, and our infiltration and data collection strategy.
ImpaaS.ru operations are analysed in Section 5. Section 6 discusses
our findings, and Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 User impersonation attacks
With the rise of sophisticated web applications, much of a user’s In-
ternet activity happens by accessing a multitude of remote services,
from banking to e-commerce and social network platforms, through
the browser. Most of these services will have authentication mech-
anisms that are meant to grant access to the underlying service to
the authorized user(s) only. From an attacker’s perspective, user
impersonation provides a large portfolio of additional attack op-
portunities, ranging from economic gain [2, 16] to more targeted
scenarios such as targeted-phishing [24] and violent crimes [21].
Password-based authentication (PBA) is the most common (first)
barrier attackers have to overcome to perform an impersonation
attack. Whereas passwords have proven difficult to securely handle,
are prone to leaks and to off-line attacks [32, 43] and still present
severe usability problems [37], they represent the most widespread
means of authentication online [7, 8]. PBA requires users to create
a non trivial secret, not to reuse it across several services and to
memorize both the secret and where it has been used; nonetheless,
several studies indicate that up to ≈ 90% of users reuse passwords
or small variations thereof across several services [14, 28].
Whereas this leaves room for password guessing attack, addi-
tional attack vectors (such as malware and phishing [9, 40]) can be
used to obtain user passwords, regardless of their complexity. In
general, hijacked accounts can allow adversaries to tap into social
connections of victims to compromise additional accounts [18, 39],
by creating targeted social-engineering attacks against their circle
of trust or by spamming malicious content [36], liquidate financial
assets [27], steal sensitive information with the aim of blackmailing
users [9, 36] and sextortion [42]. Additionally, stolen user creden-
tials are oftentimes made available to the cybercrime community
through underground markets [35, 40]. These markets generally
provide ‘dumps’ of stolen credentials obtained from data leaks from
an affected platform, or as a result of an extensive phishing cam-
paign targeting its users [40]; common target platforms include
banking or trading websites, cryptocurrency services, pornographic
websites, and other internet services. A recent estimation calcu-
lates that, between March 2016 and March 2017, 1.9 billion phished
credentials has been sold through the underground markets [40].
2.2 Countermeasures to attacks against PBA
Multi-Factor Authentication. To mitigate the shortcomings of
authentication mechanisms relying solely on passwords, web plat-
forms have started adopting additional authentication measures
such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA moved the au-
thentication paradigm from (solely) something that the user knows
(e.g. a password) to something the user has (e.g., a token) [15, 40].
This is achieved mainly with a combination of a pair of valid cre-
dentials and a One Time Passcode (OTP) received via some trusted
component such as a mobile phone, email, or a hardware token [15].
Albeit possible attack scenarios exist where the attacker can obtain
the information required for the authentication almost in real-time
(stolen token generator, compromised email, SIM swap attacks [33],
etc.), MFA dramatically increases the costs for an attacker, and is
widely regarded as an effective countermeasure to password-based
impersonation attacks [40]. Nonetheless, MFA is not devoid of se-
curity problems, perhaps most notably related to its usability [31],
concerns on token-recovery mechanisms, and third-party trust [7].
Risk-Based Authentication. Partly to mitigate the usability prob-
lem, Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) is oftentimes adopted as a
means to evaluate whether the authenticating user is (likely to
be) the one that has, historically, access to a specific account. RBA
is an adaptive security technique aiming to strengthen password-
based authentication by monitoring how unexpected or suspicious
a login attempt is from the perspective of the authenticating ser-
vice [31, 40, 41]. During the authentication, the RBA system moni-
tors both behavioral and technical characteristics of the user and of
the device, producing a fingerprint of the authenticating user [41].
RBA computes a risk score associated to the ongoing authentica-
tion by comparing the existent profile of the authenticating user
against the features collected for that instance of the authentica-
tion. The features vary from basic information such as User-Agent,
system time and OS, to environmental or behavioral features, such
as system language, keyboard layout, fonts and plugins installed,
mouse movement, geolocation and keystroke speed [1, 17, 40, 41].
Whereas the high dimensionality of this data generates, with high
probability, unique ‘fingerprints’ of a user, these are not necessarily
stable in time (as, for example, users may access the service from
multiple or new systems, may update software configurations, or
authenticate from different locations). Depending on the computed
risk score for that transaction, the authenticating service may grant
access to the user with only a valid password (if the risk level is
low), or require additional authentication factors (e.g., codes sent
to associated email accounts, SMS verification) or even deny access
for higher risk levels [31, 41]. This mechanism relies on the assump-
tion that attackers cannot systematically re-create the profile of the
victim, unless the attacker is already in control of a user’s system.
Following the implementation of RBA techniques across critical
services, adversaries developed sophisticated solutions aiming to
impersonate the user profile of the authenticating user. Recent lit-
erature has shown that phishing kits have developed capabilities
to obtain user profiles that can then be re-used by the attacker;
similarly, recent malware has been specifically engineered to re-
port user activity back to the attacker [40]. In particular, Thomas
et al. [40] highlight the improved capabilities of phishing kits in
collecting information related to victims, including geographical
location, browser metadata and answers to security questions; they
found that attacks relying on user profile information collected
from phishing kits are 40 times more likely to be successful than
‘regular’ attacks based on leaked credentials. On the other hand,
the collection of user profile information does not scale well across
users and platforms as user profiles may vary with time, across
services, and must to be collected by the attacker through additional
attack means (e.g., phishing).
2.3 Analysis of current attack strategies
Attack capabilities. From the analysis above, we identify six ca-
pabilities required to systematically bypass RBA systems.
Password authentication. At the very minimum, an attacker needs
the authentication credentials of the victim.
User profiling. To attempt circumventing RBA systems, an attacker
should have an accurate measurement of the victim’s profile/fin-
gerprint for that platform.
Multi-platform. The attacker may need to access multiple web plat-
forms to bypass some MFA controls (e.g. tokens or OTPs sent to an
email account of the victim). Authentication credentials and user
profiles need to be collected for these additional platforms as well.
The capability of impersonating the victim on multiple platforms
further increases the attack surface in scope of the attacker.
Profile updates. User profiles are unique but not necessarily sta-
ble. For example, a user may update a password, change software
configuration, or access the service from a different geographical
region. These changes may invalidate previously collected profiles
for that user, which may therefore require updating.
Infection infrastructure. The attacker requires an infrastructure to in-
fect users, and collect and update the collected user profiles. This has
to be maintained as defensive capabilities evolve (e.g. blacklisting
of an employed phishing domain), and may require the acquisition
of external services (e.g., for an infection update [10, 20]).
Automated profile enforcement. Once a profile is collected, the at-
tacker needs to enforce it when authenticating on the platform.
Whereas some aspects of the profile are easy to reproduce (e.g., user
agent, screen resolution), others are not (e.g., installed fonts/plugins,
keystroke speed, mouse movements, etc.). As profiles change across
users and platforms, the attacker likely needs a system capable of
enforcing the collected profiles in an automated fashion.
Analysis across attack strategies. Kurt et al. [40] identify three
main strategies for impersonation attacks. Table 1 provides an
overview of their capabilities.
Leaked credentials. credentials derived from data breaches on a
platform. Leaked credentials are generally traded in bulk in under-
ground forums; the leaked data oftentimes only contain associations
between usernames and (hashed) password, with no user profile
information. The data is static and if a user changes the password,
the information owned by the attacker loses all value. As the leak
concerns only one platform (and multiple leaks are likely unrelated
to each other), cross-platform attacks against one user are not en-
