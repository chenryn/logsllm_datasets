**ATT&CK ID:** S0501  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** PipeMon

The PipeMon installer modifies the Windows Registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors` to install PipeMon as a Print Processor. This modification allows PipeMon to be executed as part of the print processing pipeline, providing a persistent and stealthy method for the malware to operate on the system.
