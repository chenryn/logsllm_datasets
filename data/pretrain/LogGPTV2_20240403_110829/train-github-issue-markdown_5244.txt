Here are 2 ways to drop rows from a pandas data-frame based on a condition:
  1. `df = df[condition]`
  2. `df.drop(df[condition].index, axis=0, inplace=True)`
The first one does not do it _inplace_ , right?
The second one does not work as expected when the index is not unique, so the
user would need to `reset_index()` then `set_index()` back.
**Question**  
Would it be possible to have column dropping based directly on the condition?  
e.g.  
`df.drop(condition, axis=0, inplace=True)`
