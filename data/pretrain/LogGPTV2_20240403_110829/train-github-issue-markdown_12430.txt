Code is Repeated twice leading to a second button.  
This happens in "Target the Parent of an Element Using jQuery" (This might not
be the only location)
HOW TO REPRODUCE:
  1. use this link (only the code is necessary): http://goo.gl/6U2rQC
  2. reload the page  
(see how #target5 is in #left-well twice?, this shouldn't be the case)

            #left-well
              #target1
              #target2
              #target3
            #right-well
              #target4
              #target5
              #target6
