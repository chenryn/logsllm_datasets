**ATT&CK ID:** S0446  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Ryuk

Ryuk malware constructs seemingly legitimate installation folder paths by invoking the `GetWindowsDirectoryW` function and then inserting a null byte at the fourth character of the returned path. For systems running Windows Vista or higher, this results in a path that appears as `C:\Users\Public`.

### Explanation:
- **GetWindowsDirectoryW Function:** This function retrieves the path to the Windows directory.
- **Null Byte Insertion:** By inserting a null byte at the fourth character, the malware truncates the actual path, making it appear as a standard system directory (e.g., `C:\Users\Public`).
- **Purpose:** This technique is used to make the malware's presence less suspicious and to blend in with normal system files.

### Example:
- **Actual Path Returned by `GetWindowsDirectoryW`:** `C:\Windows`
- **Modified Path with Null Byte:** `C\0:\Users\Public`

This manipulation helps Ryuk evade detection by appearing to reside in a common and trusted directory.
