Since #19488, the network service is enabled and the old path has been
deleted. Some features are broken as a result and will need to be fixed before
8.0.0. This is a tracking issue for those features.
  * webRequest API (zcbenz)
  * service workers on file protocol (#20132)
  * session.clearAuthCache - tests (#20015)
  * session.getBlobData (#20041)
  * session.setUserAgent (#20014)
  * custom standard schemes / registerSchemesAsPrivileged
  * Rewire Login Handler from NetworkDelegate into ProxyingURLLoaderFactory
  * fix 'login' event not firing on net requests
