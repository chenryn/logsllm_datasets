Call me crazy but.
What if I need to create a highly consuming task I don't want to be runned by
Deno? Is there any way to program Rust code inside Deno?
Or do I have to set up a completely new Rust server to do it and call it as an
API?
I honestly don't see a way to do this without making a hole in the whole Deno
structure, but being able to use Rust as more than just the interpreter looked
like an idea that's worth giving a shot.
