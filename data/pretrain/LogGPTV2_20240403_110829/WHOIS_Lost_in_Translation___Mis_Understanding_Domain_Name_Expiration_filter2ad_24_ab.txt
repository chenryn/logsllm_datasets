previous day. As discussed in Section 2, expiring names
are removed from the DNS zone when they enter re-
demption period (or earlier); however, they can also be
removed for various other reasons, such as misconﬁgur-
ation. Since Whois records remain active throughout
3
the 35 days of the redemption and pending delete peri-
ods until the ﬁnal deletion of the domain, we can extract
all required metadata and verify the domain’s status.
3.2 Domain Tracking
To keep track of domains as they evolve through vari-
ous states of expiration and potentially re-registration,
we built a system that schedules periodic Whois quer-
ies for domains removed from the DNS zone. After a
ﬁrst lookup immediately upon removal, future lookups
are scheduled regularly until the results of the lookup in-
dicate either that the domain will not expire in the near
future (e.g., it was renewed), or when a re-registration
is observed. We stop tracking such domains to reduce
the number of lookups needed to run our measurement.
For domains found to be re-registered, if the query
date was only ﬁve days or less after the creation date,
as a precaution we schedule them for another query six
days later to rule out the possibility of domain tasting:
Some registries allow registrars to delete a new domain
up to ﬁve days after creation (the add grace period in
Figure 1) and do not charge for the domain. Domain
tasting was found to be responsible for 76 % of com re-
gistrations in 2008, with each registration lasting for an
average of 3.4 days, and is said to be used by domain
speculators to test for free how much traﬃc a domain re-
ceives [9]. Since we cannot reliably observe all instances
of domain tasting at a reasonable query frequency, we
remove the cases that we do observe from our data set.
That is, we consider only re-registrations that were act-
ive for at least six days.
Our experiment lasted a total of 10 months. We inser-
ted domains removed from the zone ﬁle each day during
the ﬁrst seven months and kept tracking these domains
for three more months, giving us between three and ten
months of history for each domain. To keep the number
of Whois lookups manageable, we performed random
sampling of the domains removed from the zone ﬁles
up to the daily limits outlined in Table 1. This al-
lowed us to handle all domains removed from smaller
zones and almost 30 % of even the largest com zone. We
scheduled Whois lookups at a bi-weekly frequency so
that we could observe each domains’ records in diﬀer-
ent expiration states while not overburdening our sys-
tem. Overall, we collected nearly 86.2 M Whois records
from 7.4 M domains in the ﬁve zones (Table 2). Since
most registries did not publish any query rate limits,
we conservatively performed one lookup every 2 s per
IP address (20 s for org, below the published limit of
15 s). Our crawlers always received valid Whois re-
sponses without being slowed down or banned.
Unfortunately, when starting our measurement, we
were not aware of the many intricacies and hidden do-
main states of the Whois protocol that we describe in
Section 3.3. Our analysis revealed that the scheduler
had sometimes incorrectly inferred domain states, not
the least because some states can be inferred correctly
only in retrospect but not at the time of the observation.
To account for this, at the end of our measurement we
looked up every domain name ever tracked by our sys-
tem so that we have at least two Whois observations for
each domain. While two lookups are suﬃcient to meas-
ure re-registrations, the intermediate data points were
necessary in many cases to understand in detail how
domain expiration works, and how to ﬁlter and post-
process the dataset as described in Section 3.4. For
future measurement studies, we recommend looking up
each domain only twice several months apart, or using
periodic but unconditional lookups.
3.3 Whois Data Intricacies
When we ﬁrst looked at the collected data, we no-
ticed a number of unexpected scenarios, such as de-
creasing expiration dates and seemingly overlapping re-
gistrations for the same domain. Upon further investig-
ation, we found that these cases resulted from domain
states that were not explicit in the Whois records. We
provide an overview of frequent issues that may be of
interest to other researchers working with Whois data.
Increasing and Decreasing Expiration Dates:
When a registrar does not renew or delete a domain be-
fore its expiration date, the registry automatically ex-
tends the registration by one year by moving the domain
into the auto-renew state. However, since intended re-
newals typically occur before the expiration date, most
automatically renewed domains will in fact be deleted
during the 45-day grace period and enter redemption
period, during which the expiration date may or may
not decrease by one year to the previous value.
Inconsistent and Incomplete Flag Use: While
EPP deﬁnes status codes [3] corresponding to the do-
main states in Figure 1, not all of these possible ﬂags
are used in practice, and their use varies by registry
and registrar. Out of the ﬁve registries in our dataset,
only org had the autoRenewPeriod ﬂag set. For the
other registries, it is not possible to tell whether the ex-
piration date shown in the Whois record is the actual
expiration date or the provisionally extended one—see,
e.g., the 2003 discussion on DNSO’s registrars mailing
list.1 Note that even for org, a single observation dur-
ing the redemption or pending delete periods does not
reveal whether the year of the expiration date is cor-
rect since it often remains at the increased value and
only a prior observation of the autoRenewPeriod ﬂag
could help in disambiguating the data. As another ex-
ample for the inconsistent use of ﬂags, com and net use
redemptionPeriod and pendingDelete in a mutually ex-
clusive way, whereas org sets both ﬂags simultaneously
during redemption period.
Delayed Updates: We sometimes observed brief
delays between events that we expected to co-occur,
such as the beginning of the auto-renew period and the
increase of the expiration date. This might be due to

some changes being made by the registrar while others
are done by the registry, as alluded to in the mailing list
discussion above. Due to these ambiguities, the state of
a domain can often be inferred only in retrospect by
making use of multiple Whois observations.
3.4 Data Filtering and Post-Processing
Our data encompasses 7.4 M domains from ﬁve zones,
all with at least two Whois observations between three
and ten months apart (see Table 2). Although all in-
stances of domain tasting re-registrations were already
detected and removed during the scheduling phase, we
still need to account for several other artefacts of the
data before we can measure re-registration delays.
As the ﬁrst step, we remove domains that did not
expire during our measurement (or were renewed), that
is, domains for which all Whois observations contain
the same creation date and no observation of a “do-
main not found” response—these domains were likely
removed from the DNS zone for reasons other than ex-
piration. Next, we remove domains having a “domain
not found” response as the ﬁrst lookup result. In all like-
lihood, these are not expirations, but deletions during
the add grace period (i.e., domain tasting registrations)
because they do not go through the redemption period
and Whois records become unavailable immediately.
Our next set of ﬁlters is based on the time diﬀer-
ence between the ﬁrst Whois lookup, that is, the time
the domain was removed from the DNS zone, and the
expiration date found in the corresponding Whois re-
cord. Since we are interested in expiring domains, they
should not disappear from the DNS zone before the ex-
piration date, and they should not be removed more
than 45 + 1 days after their expiration date, which is
the maximum duration of grace periods before the re-
demption period (we add one day to account for possible
delays in our pipeline). Since registries may automatic-
ally increase the expiration date of expired domains by

one year (Section 3.3), the aforementioned interval can
also occur shifted by 365 days. Figure 2 visualises the
removal/expiration date time diﬀerence for our org do-
mains; we retain the domains in the right shaded inter-
val as “regular” expirations, and those in the left shaded
interval as “auto-renew” expirations. The vast majority
of expiring org domains already have their expiration
date increased by one year, whereas the opposite is true
for ﬁrst observations of com, net and biz domains.
We remove the domains in the three remaining inter-
vals. The leftmost interval corresponds to domains that
were deleted more than one year before their expiration
date; these are likely domains that were manually and
purposefully deleted. We remove these domains since
their deletion time appears unrelated to their expiration
date, and because our analysis of re-registration delays
is based on the assumption that domains remain active
until the expiration date. The rightmost interval con-
tains domains that remained in the DNS zone for longer
than expected (one example entered redemption period
more than 2.5 months after the expiration date). We
exclude these atypical cases since they may correspond
to registrar errors or special handling of domains under
dispute or suspicion of maliciousness. The middle inter-
val is a combination of the two aforementioned cases,
that is, domains manually deleted less than one year
before the expiration date, and “auto-renew” domains
removed from the DNS zone later than expected.
