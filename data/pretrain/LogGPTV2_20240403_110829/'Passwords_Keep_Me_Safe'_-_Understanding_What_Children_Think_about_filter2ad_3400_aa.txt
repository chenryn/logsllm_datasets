Abstract 
Children use technology from a very young age, and often 
have  to  authenticate.  The  goal  of  this  study  is  to  explore 
children’s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding 
passwords. Given the limited work to date and the fact  that 
the world’s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on 
today’s  youth,  it  is  imperative  to  conduct  cybersecurity 
research  with  children.  We  conducted  the  first  large-scale 
survey of 1,505 3rd to 12th graders from schools across the 
United  States.  Not  surprisingly,  children  have  fewer 
passwords  than  adults.  We  found  that  children  have 
complicated relationships with passwords: on one hand, their 
perceptions about passwords and statements about password 
behavior are appropriate; on the other hand, however, they 
simultaneously do not tend to make strong passwords, and 
practice bad password behavior such as sharing passwords 
with  friends.  We  conclude  with  a  call  for  cybersecurity 
education  to  bridge  the  gap  between  students’  password 
knowledge with their password behavior, while continuing 
to provide and promote security understandings.

School  children  are  engaged  in  technology  and  cyber 
learning  at  very  young  ages.  In  fact,  today’s  primary  and 
secondary  school  children  referred  to  as  “digital  natives” 
[32] or “neo-digital natives” [29] have never experienced a 
world without technology. Computer technology is just a part 
of their lives. As a result, children are exposed to more and 
more  systems  designed  specifically  for  them  as  well  as 
accessing and using ubiquitous applications such as social 
media. Many of these systems require authentication to retain 
a history of interaction, or to ensure that it is genuinely the 
child using the system. Without evidence of clearly superior 
and  appropriate  alternatives,  it  is  understandable  that 
developers implement passwords. As a result, children are 
actively 
frequently  using  passwords,  making 
and 
understanding 
their  password  practices  and  behavior 
important.  
Usability testing with children is constrained by strict ethical 
requirements which may discourage researchers from testing 
authentication mechanisms with this target group altogether 
[16, 26]. Most of the research in usable security has focused 
Introduction 
on adults. Yet, over the next 10 to 20 years the world’s cyber 
posture and culture will be dependent on the cybersecurity 
and  privacy  knowledge  and  practices  of  today’s  youth. 
Without an understanding of extant behavior, it is infeasible 
to start seeking an alternative, more appropriate, mechanism 
for child-tailored authentication. Despite extensive studies of 
password practices of participants over 18 years old (e.g., [1, 
7, 14, 17, 31, 43]), children’s password practices have not 
been well studied.  
To understand current children’s password perceptions and 
behavior,  we  conducted  a  study  to  answer  the  following 
research questions (RQ): 
RQ1. Password Understandings: 
(a)  What do students know about passwords? 
(b)  Why do they think they need passwords? 
(c)  What are students’ passwords perceptions? 
RQ2. Password Behaviors: 
(a)  How do students create and maintain passwords? 
(b)  What are the characteristics of passwords they 
create? 
The contributions of this paper are threefold: 
1)  Firstly, we conducted the first large-scale study on the 
use,  perceptions  and  behavior  of  passwords  of  the 
United States (US) youth 3rd to 12th grades–Generation 
Z (Gen Z) those born from the mid-1990’s to the late 
2000’s [29]; 
2)  Secondly,  we  characterize  the  state  of  children’s 
perceptions and knowledge of passwords; 
3)  Finally, we offer concrete suggestions for next steps in 
both youth password research and education. 
We next review related work. We present our methodology 
followed by results, discussion and conclusions.  
2  Related Research 
In 2015, 94% of US children between the ages of 3 and 18 
had a computer at home, and 86% of children had internet 
access at home [39]. As of 2019, 53% of children own their 
own smartphone by age 11, with that number rising to 84% 
among teenagers [11]. Children around the world are going 
online more, at younger ages, and in more diverse ways [13]. 
Children  spend  more  time  on  screen  media  performing

various  activities  such  as  TV/videos,  gaming,  browsing 
websites, and social media [11]. As children are doing more 
activities  online,  they  are  creating  user  accounts  and 
passwords as required by those online systems. However, the 
research  topic  on  children’s  password  perceptions  and 
practices  has  not  been  extensively  studied,  so  there  is  a 
comparative lack of literature available. 
In 2019, Choong et al [9] performed a systematic search on 
cybersecurity research involving children and classified 78 
papers into two major categories – Designing for Children, 
and  Children  &  Authentication  which  each  was  further 
broken into six sub-categories. They identified a gap in the 
literature related to children’s password comprehension and 
practices. This present study seeks to fill that gap. 
Several 
researchers  performed  empirical  studies  on 
children’s  passwords  with  small  numbers  of  participants, 
usually  with  narrow  (two  years)  age  ranges  (e.g.,  [21,  27, 
33]). These studies agree that the younger a child is the less 
complex their passwords are and should be required to be due 
to  age-specific  factors  like  memory  and  spelling,  and  that 
children  frequently  use  personal  information  in  password 
creation  [21,  27,  33].  Other  researchers  used  surveys  to 
gather  larger  amounts  of  data  on  children’s  password 
knowledge  and  behaviors  and  found  similar  results.  For 
example, Rim and Choi [35] analyzed password generation 
types  from  550  middle  and  high  school  students  in  South 
Korea and concluded that students are likely to use personal 
information in their passwords. Further, the study found that 
participants seldom worried about protecting passwords and 
personal  information.  This  is  concerning  because,  as 
revealed in Irwin’s [23] investigation of 258 10th to 12th grade 
South African Students’ risk taking behavior and awareness, 
students in this age group have a high level of risk and gaps 
in their risk awareness and avoidance behavior. Coggins [10] 
conducted  a  small-scale  survey  on  children’s  password 
knowledge from 74 4th to 6th grade students that supports all 
of  the  above  studies,  finding  that  70%  of  participating 
students used personal information in their passwords and 
32% had experienced hacking. Our present study seeks to 
build  upon  these  findings  by  investigating  a  full  range  of 
school-age students from 3rd to 12th grade, and exploring  not 
only students’ password behavior, but also their perceptions 
and understandings about the role of passwords.  
In addition to the field of knowledge surrounding children’s 
password  behavior,  several  studies  have 
investigated 
children’s perceptions of online privacy and security more 
broadly. For example, Kumar et al [24] interviewed 18 US 
families with children ages 5 to 11, and found that children 
on  the  upper  end  of  that  age  range  generally  recognized 
certain privacy and security components, but that younger 
participants  (5-7)  had  gaps  in  their  knowledge.  Zhang-
Kennedy et al [45] similarly conducted interviews with 14 
Canadian parent-child dyads with children ages 7 to 11 to 
understand their concept of privacy and perceptions of online 
threats. The study found that children and adults view online 
privacy  and  security  differently,  with  children  being  less 
concerned  than  their  parents  about  security  threats  and 
mostly worried about threats from local (family, friends, etc.) 
sources.  Our  present  study  seeks  to  combine  the  focus  on 
perception  in  the  above  studies  with  an  emphasis  on 
password  knowledge  and  understandings  as  well  as 
password use.  
Methodologically  speaking,  researchers  frequently  use 
surveys and questionnaires  in order to understand children’s 
perceptions  and  awareness  of  online  safety,  privacy  and 
security.  For  example,  Žufić  et  al  [46]  administered  three 
surveys over the course of eight years to 1,232 students ages 
7 to 15 in Croatia to find that student use of information-
telecommunication technology is increasing over time, but 
student safety awareness is not. Yilmaz et al [44] similarly 
deployed a survey to 2,029 Turkish high school students and 
revealed that only about half of the students surveyed have 
high awareness of how to ensure information security toward 
threats.  Paluckaitė  et  al  [30]  survey  of  152  Lithuanian 
adolescents’  perceptions  of  risky  online  behavior  adds 
nuance to these security threat understandings by revealing 
that many participants do understand risky behavior as risky 
but still engage in them, which may or may not be a product 
of their awareness of privacy and security threats. Across the 
board, these studies serve as precedents for our own use of 
surveys to investigate students’ password use, perceptions, 
and behaviors. 
Based  on  the  literature  reviewed  above,  currently  existing 
research often uses a small sample size, does not cover a full 
age  range  of  K-12  students,  and  usually  does  not  offer 
inferential 
different 
developmental stages in order to gain insight on age-related 
progression in children’s understanding of cybersecurity and 
privacy.  While  there  have  been  a  few  larger-scale  survey 
studies, they have been all focusing on children outside of 
the US. Investigation in this area to understand and gauge 
current levels of US children’s comprehension and practice 
related  to  passwords  is  essential  to  provide  insights  into 
overall children’s cybersecurity hygiene. This study seeks to 
add  to  the  burgeoning  field  of  scholarship    surrounding 
children’s  password  use,  perceptions,  and  understandings 
while  also  addressing  the  aforementioned  shortcomings  in 
the  field  by  conducting  a  large-scale  survey  of  students 
between  ages  8  and  18  (3rd  to  12th  grades)  in  the  United 
States.

12th  grades  (ages  of  8  to  18  years  old).  The  goal  was  to 
identify  students’  practices,  perceptions,  and  knowledge 
regarding  passwords.  Each  student  answered  questions 
assessing  their  use  of  computers,  passwords,  password 
practices,  knowledge  about  and  feelings  about  passwords, 
together with information about grade and gender.  
3.1 
The  research  questions  guided  the  development  of  survey 
objectives  for  accessing  student’s  use  of  computers,  of 
passwords, password practices, knowledge about passwords, 
feelings about passwords, and tests for age differences. A list 
of possible items was generated targeting the objectives. All 
of the items were closed response except for two numerical 
response and two open response items where students were 
asked: how many passwords they have; how many times a 
day they use passwords; to list a reason(s) why people should 
use  passwords,  and  to  create  a  new  password  for  a  given 
scenario.  
Early in survey development, feedback from teachers and a 
pilot survey suggested that two surveys featuring the same 
questions  but  using  different,  age-appropriate  language 
would be required to accommodate the wide age range of the 
intended  student  population.  Thus,  two  surveys  were 
designed: a 15-item survey for 3rd to 5th graders, and a 16-
item survey for 6th to 12th graders. The extra item in the 6th to 
12th  grade  survey  asked  students  whether  they  have 
experience  helping  their  family  members  with  passwords. 
The content of the other 15 questions was identical across the 
two surveys, with the language and format of the response 
variables adjusted to be age appropriate. For example, most 
of the response variables were “Yes” or “No” for the 3rd to 5th 
graders, while the 6th to 12th graders’ response variables were 
more detailed and they were asked to check all variables that 
apply. 
To ascertain the content and construct validity of the survey 
instruments,  four 
types  of  reviews  were  conducted 
iteratively. Content experts in usable security were asked to 
evaluate the alignment matrix and provide feedback on the 
alignment  of  the  categories  with  the  scope  of  the  survey 
goals, the alignment of the items with the category, and the 
possibility of missing items. Survey experts also reviewed 
each item for clarity for the intended audience, appropriate 
format, and alignment of response options. Content experts 
(elementary, middle and high school teachers) focused on the 
language and format of the items based on the grade/age of 
the students. As a pilot, cognitive interviews with students 
were also conducted using a talk-aloud protocol to determine 
if  the  questions  were  being  appropriately  interpreted.

both  paraphrase  items  (e.g.,  “How  would  you  ask  the 
question in your own words”) and interpret them (e.g., “What 
is  your  answer  and  why”)  complemented  the  talk-aloud 
protocol. After each type of review, the survey instruments 
were refined based on the feedback and comments. The final 
surveys  were  converted 
to  Scantron©  forms–machine 
readable paper forms as shown in the Appendix. 
3.2 
The  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
Institutional  Review  Board reviewed  and approved the 
protocol for this project and all subjects provided informed 
consent in accordance with 15 CFR 27, the Common Rule 
for  the  Protection  of  Human  Subjects. The  sampling  plan 
focused on recruiting participants from at least three different 
school  districts  from  three  different  US  regions–the  East, 
South,  and  Midwest–in  order  to  collect  a  geographically 
diverse  and  more  nationally 
sample 
population. Principals and teachers from the selected districts 
were  recruited  using  a  snowball  sampling  approach.  The 
principals  were  to  determine  which  classrooms  would 
participate,  and  the  selected  classroom  teachers  would 
distribute parental consent forms. 
The  schools, 
that 
participated were compensated. Each school received $1000, 
the  teachers  received  $50  gift  cards,  and  the  students 
received age-appropriate trinkets such as caricature erasers 
or ear buds, for example. Each participating classroom also 
received $50 for a classroom thank-you celebration where all 
students  celebrated.  Parental  consent  and  student  assent 
forms were collected prior to survey distribution. The survey 
administration was tailored for the appropriate age group: all 
children  completed  Scantron©  survey  forms,  with  teachers 
reading the survey aloud in the 3rd to 5th grades. The data 
were collected anonymously. All open-ended responses were 
manually entered into a spreadsheet by the researchers. Each 
completed survey was assigned a unique random participant 
identifier, for example, P1234.

3.4  Data Analysis Procedure  
Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency and 
percentage  of  the  categories  that  participants  chose  as 
responses  to  the  multiple-choice  questions.  We  compared 
groups using inferential statistics with an overall significance 
level set at α = 0.05.
