User: I have installed Python 2.7.2 (Win7 32-bit) and Google App Engine SDK 1.6.1 for Win7 on a 64-bit system running Win7 Home Premium.  Default folder locations for both Python and GAE.  When I try to run the helloworld project as described in the Google Python Getting Started doc, the Launcher's "browse" button never becomes active.  The GAE SDK is supposed to do fine with Python 2.7.
Is there a complete listing anywhere of environment variables needed for this setup to work?  So far, all posts I have seen are from users who have gotten well past this absolutely basic step.
Assistant: I compared the helloworld example to the guestbook demo and found that the application element was key.  I added the line at the top of the app.yaml file "application: helloworld" and the helloworld example started working in the Google App Engine (GAE).  Note that the 'application' element is supposed to be optional as defined in the app.yaml reference.  It looks like it is optional if you use the command line, and it is not optional if you use GAE.
