multiple measurements are provided for each link [32].
The map of the 44 node locations is shown in [23]. The
measurement environment is an indoor environment with
obstacles (e.g., cubicle ofﬁces and furniture) and scatters
(e.g., windows and doors). More information regarding the
CRAWDAD data set can be found in [22], [32].
A. Authentication at the Helper Node
To avoid interfering with the primary user’s transmission,
the helper node needs to ﬁrst sense the channel, and verify
whether a received signal is from the primary user. As
discussed earlier, false alarms and false negatives may occur
during the authentication process. Thus, we evaluate the
performance of the authentication method in terms of the
probability of false negative and the probability of false
alarm.
Recall that during authentication the helper node com-
putes the amplitude ratio of the ﬁrst multipath component
to the second multipath component for each received signal.
If the amplitude ratio is larger than a threshold, then the
received signal is considered from the primary user. Other-
wise, it is considered from the attacker. Hence, false alarms
happen when the primary user’s amplitude ratio is less than
the threshold, and false negative happens when the attacker’s
amplitude ratio is larger than the threshold.
1) Probability of False Alarm: To obtain the amplitude
ratio of the primary user’s signal, we perform experiments
as follows. For 1 ≤ i ≤ 44, we assume that node i is
the helper node. For each of the remaining nodes, if there
is no obstruction between itself and node i, we mark it
as a line-of-sight node. Among all line-of-sight nodes for
node i, we pick the one that is closest to node i as an
approximation of the primary user p. Note that some nodes
do not have line-of-sight nodes in their vicinities, and thus
they are not used in our experiment (e.g., nodes 8 and 29 in
the map shown by [23]). Finally, we compute the amplitude
ratio using the primary user’s channel impulse responses
(i.e., link signatures of link (p, i)). The CRAWDAD data
set has multiple measurements for each link. Thus, we can
get multiple amplitude ratios for each link. We sort the
collected amplitude ratios and compute empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF) for them. Let N denote the
number of the collected amplitude ratios, F (x) denote the
empirical CDF, and x1, ..., xN denote the sorted amplitude
ratios, where xi ≤ xj for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N . The empirical
n≤xi
CDF F (xi) is given by F (xi) =
N , where n≤xi is the
number of amplitude ratios that are less than or equal to xi.
Figure 10 shows the empirical CDF curve of the ampli-
tude ratios computed using primary users’ channel impulse
responses. This CDF curve can be used to derive the
probability of false alarm directly. For example, about 5%
amplitude ratios are less than or equal to 5. Hence, if the
threshold is set to 5, then 5% amplitude ratios are smaller
than the threshold and the probability of false alarm is 0.05.

2) Probability of False Negative: We perform experiment
to examine the amplitude ratios of attackers’ signals. For
1 ≤ i ≤ 44, we assume that node i is the helper node and
ﬁnd its primary user p using the same method as discussed
in the above experiment. For each of the remaining nodes,
we calculate the distance between this node and the helper
node. We mark the node as the attacker if the calculated
distance is larger than r times of the distance between the
helper node and the primary user, where r is set to 2, 4, and
8 in our experiment. We compute the amplitude ratio for
node i using the attacker’s channel impulse responses (i.e.,
link signatures of link (a, i), where a is the node index of
the attacker).
Figure 11 shows the empirical CDF curves of all am-
plitude ratios computed using attackers’ channel impulse
responses. In particular, about 95% amplitude ratios of
attackers’ signals are less than or equal to 5 for all possible
values of r (i.e., r = 2, 4, 8). Based on the empirical CDF
of the amplitude ratios, we generate Figure 14 to show the
relationship between the probability of false negative and
the threshold. For instance, the empirical CDF indicates
that about 95% amplitude ratios are less than or equal to
5. Hence, about 5% amplitude ratios are larger than 5 and

the probability of false negative is 0.05 if the threshold is
set to 5. It is shown in Figure 14 that the probability of false
negative decreases as the distance between the attacker and
the helper node increases (i.e., r gets larger).

3) Trade off between Probability of False Alarm and
Probability of False Negative: Let PF A and PF N denote the
probability of false alarm and false negative, respectively.
We analyze the trade off between PF A and PF N by ex-
amining the relationship between PF A and the threshold, as
well as the relationship between PF N and the threshold. For
a particular value of threshold, the authentication approach
would achieve a particular PF A and PF N .
Table I shows the probability PF N when the probability
PF A of false alarm ranges between 0.05 and 0.2. If PF A =
0.05, PF N is less than 0.0655, 0.0486, and 0.0321 for r = 2,
4, and 8, respectively. For a constant PF A, PF N decreases
as the distance between the attacker and the helper node
increases (i.e., r increases). In particular, PF N = 0.0655
when the distance between the attacker and the helper node
is larger than twice of the distance between the primary
user and the helper node (i.e., r = 2). However, PF N falls
to 0.0321 when the distance between the attacker and the
helper node is 8 times larger than the distance between the
primary user and the helper node (i.e., r = 8).

B. Authentication at Secondary Users
During the authentication process at a secondary user, the
secondary user needs to verify whether a received signal
is from the primary user or not by looking at the distance
between the corresponding link signature and the training
set. We refer to the distance as link difference. If the link
difference is smaller than a threshold, then the received
signal is considered from the primary user. Otherwise, the
signal
is considered to be sent by an attacker and the
secondary user discards it.
Therefore, a false alarm happens if the link difference
between the primary user’s link signature and the secondary
user’s training set is larger than the threshold, and a false
negative happens if the link difference between the attacker’s
link signature and the secondary user’s training set is smaller
than the threshold. Similar to the authentication at
the
helper node, we use the probability of false alarm and the
probability of false negative to measure the performance of
the proposed approach.
In our experiment, we compute the link differences be-
tween the primary user’s link signature and the secondary
user’s training set, as well as the link differences between
the attacker’s link signature and the secondary user’s training
set. Based on their statistical distributions, we examine how
likely false alarms and false negatives would happen.
1) Probability of False Alarm: To get the link differ-
ences between link signatures of the primary user and the
secondary user’s training set, we perform experiment as
follows. We pick all nodes one by one as the primary user.
Starting with node 1, we use the node closest to node 1 to
approximate the helper node (i.e., node 3 in the map [23]).
We further assume that all the other nodes (i.e., node 2 and
nodes 4-44 on the map [23]) are secondary users. For each
secondary user s, we generate its training set using all link
signatures of the node pair (3, s) (i.e., the helper node’s link
signatures) and k (k = 0, 1, 2) link signatures of the node
pair (1, s) (i.e., the primary user’s link signatures). Then,

s, ..., d
We use the average value of d1
as the link
differences between the link signatures of node 1 and
the training sets of each secondary user s. Similarly, we
assume that nodes 2,...,44 are primary users and perform
the same process to get the link differences between the
s,...

link signatures of nodes 2,...,44 and the training sets of the
secondary users.
Figure 13 shows curves of the empirical CDFs for the
collected link differences, where each training set contains
all measured link signatures of a helper node, and k (k =
0, 1, 2) measured link signatures of a primary user. Almost
all link differences are less than or equal to 10 when the
training set only contains the link signatures of a helper node
(i.e., k = 0). Once a primary user’s link signature is added
to the training set (i.e., k = 1), the link differences decreases
dramatically. Figure 14 shows the relationship between the
probability of false alarm and the threshold.

2) Probability of False Negative: We also perform experi-
ment to examine the link differences between link signatures
of attackers and training sets of secondary users. We assume
that node 1 is the attacker. We pick node p as the primary
user and node s as the secondary user such that p 6= s 6= 1.
For each combination of p and s, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the helper
node of p. Let ph denote the helper node. If ph 6= s 6= 1,
we generate the training set of s using the same approach
as the ﬁrst experiment. We then compute the link difference
s,p between the attacker’s link signatures and the
d1
s,p, ..., dna
training set, where na is the number of attacker’s link
signatures. After scanning all combinations, we use the
s,p as the
average value of d1
s,p ,..., the average value of dna
link difference between link signatures of node 1 and the
training sets of secondary users. Similarly, we assume that
nodes 2,...,44 are attackers and perform the same process to
get the link differences between the link signatures of nodes
2,...,44 and the training sets of secondary users.
Figure 15 shows the empirical CDF curves of the collected
link differences for k = 0, k = 1, and k = 2. Note that the
empirical CDF curves can be used to derive the probability
of false negative directly given a threshold. For example,
about 10% link differences are less than or equal to 7.5
when k = 0. This means the probability of false negative is
0.1 for a threshold of 2.5.
