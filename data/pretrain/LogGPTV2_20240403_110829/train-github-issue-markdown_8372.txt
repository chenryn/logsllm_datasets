This would enable people to specify how long the local cache version of a repo
is valid for (default would be 0 meaning things are always pulled from the
remote).
This would mean that if the version: was set to a branch or tag name (or maybe
even a hash) we would only look at checking out the most recent version in the
local repo, unless the cache time was invalid.
This would drastically speed up / give the options to speed up ansible
playbooks that have a lot of git module / repo usage.
