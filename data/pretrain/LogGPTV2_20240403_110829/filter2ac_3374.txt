**ATT&CK ID:** T1562.011  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Spoof Security Alerting

Adversaries may spoof security alerts generated by defensive tools to present false evidence, thereby impairing defenders' awareness of malicious activity. These security alerts typically contain information about potential security events, as well as the operational status of security software and the system. Accurate security reporting is crucial for monitoring the normal operation of a system and for identifying significant events that may indicate a security incident. By spoofing these alerts, attackers can mislead security teams and delay the detection and response to actual threats.
