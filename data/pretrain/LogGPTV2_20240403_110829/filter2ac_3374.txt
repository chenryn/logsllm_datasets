ATT&CK Technique Name:Spoof Security Alerting
Adversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defendersâ€™ awareness of malicious activity.

Security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a security incident.
