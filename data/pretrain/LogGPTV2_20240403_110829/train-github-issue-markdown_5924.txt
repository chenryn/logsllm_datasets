  * I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if any
  * I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset
  * I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar
### Superset version
### Expected results
New tab should create a blank tab
### Actual results
New tab creates a duplicate of the original tab. (ok, can live with this) But
then once you start editing the new tab (ie. removing a chart), it makes the
same edit to the original tab.
### Steps to reproduce
(1) Convert existing dashboard to V2 dash  
(2) Edit dashboard  
(3) Click on + for new tab  
(4) Remove a chart from new tab
