Before submitting your issue, please ensure the following criteria are met. Thank you for your cooperation!

- I have reviewed the Superset logs for any Python stack traces and included them in the text below, if applicable.
- I have reproduced the issue using at least the latest released version of Superset.
- I have checked the issue tracker and confirmed that there is no similar issue already reported.

### Superset Version
[Please specify the version of Superset you are using.]

### Expected Results
When creating a new tab, it should be blank and independent of the original tab.

### Actual Results
Creating a new tab results in a duplicate of the original tab (this is acceptable). However, when editing the new tab (e.g., removing a chart), the same changes are applied to the original tab as well.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Convert an existing dashboard to a V2 dashboard.
2. Edit the dashboard.
3. Click on the "+" button to add a new tab.
4. Remove a chart from the new tab.

If you encounter this issue, please provide the details above along with any additional information that may help in diagnosing the problem.
