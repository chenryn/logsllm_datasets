### Bug summary
In jupyter lab, the code snippet below sets the title of the axis to the x,y
coords of a mouse click, however in matplotlib 3.5.2 specifically, the clicks
aren't registered unless I'm clicking around using the pan or zoom controls of
the interactive widget. Downgrading to matplotlib 3.5.1, the clicks are
registered with just the cursor as expected with the same ipympl version
0.9.1.
### Code for reproduction
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib widget
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,5))
    plt.plot(np.random.randint(0, 5, 5))
    plt.show()
    def onclick(event):
        ax.set_title(f'x={event.x}, y={event.y}')
        print(f'x={event.x}, y={event.y}')
    fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)
### Actual outcome
No axis title after clicking inside the plot with just a regular cursor

Axis title set after clicking inside the plot with the pan tool of the
interactive widget (same if using the zoom tool)

### Expected outcome
This screenshot was taken with mpl version 3.5.1 where the regular cursor
click was registered and the axis title was changed

### Additional information
It's also interesting that under mpl 3.5.2, the cursor remains as the finger
cursor icon after clicking while in mpl 3.5.1, the cursor icon changes back to
the regular pointer - I'm not sure what that means but it is a difference in
behavior...
