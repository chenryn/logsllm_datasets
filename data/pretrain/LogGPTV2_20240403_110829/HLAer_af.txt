### Comparison with SLCT and IPLoM

SLCT is a popular log clustering tool discussed in Section II. We applied SLCT to our datasets for comparison. SLCT requires the delimiter to be specified as input and works only on homogeneous log types. We used SLCT on the combination of Failure and HPC logs, specifying a comma as the delimiter and setting the support to 10. SLCT generated 46 clusters and 987 outliers. Interestingly, almost all HPC logs were classified as outliers, likely due to their more intrinsic formats and less frequent words.

The first three clusters should be condensed into one, as the only difference among them is the numbers (parameters) after "ambien =". Similarly, the last five clusters should also be condensed into one. To generate templates, SLCT relies on frequent words, which may not have accurate semantic meanings. In contrast, HLAer clusters such logs into one cluster due to the flexibility of its similarity measurement, which can encapsulate different words in the template. IPLoM has the same problem as SLCT, as it only considers frequent identical words. For example, IPLoM generates two clusters with the templates "169563node25nodestatus11140990821running" and "231564node70nodestatus11177219541running" for the combined dataset Failure and HPC, but these should be condensed into one. Additionally, IPLoM generates a large number of intermediate files, placing high demands on I/O.

### Comparison with CLUTO

CLUTO was also applied for clustering. The recursive bisection algorithm in CLUTO was used with 64 clusters and fssim as the similarity measure. The results are presented in Figures 13 and 14 (blue plots). 64 clusters were chosen for demonstration purposes. In the figures, the cluster ID has an offset to avoid overlap with other plots (green plots). Both figures show that CLUTO generally generates clusters corresponding to the datasets. However, CLUTO does not identify outliers but generates small clusters for them (blue dots between x-axis [1600:1800] in Figure 14). The agreement between OPTICS and CLUTO, both of which perform clustering based on the inherent structure (pairwise similarity) of the data, indicates that fssim effectively captures the inherent structure of log data.

### Outlier Detection

The entire dataset of 12,000 log records was randomly split into 5 equal folds, with 4 used for training and the last for testing. Offline detection on a single CPU took 0.053 seconds, including I/O, or 2.27e-5 seconds per testing log record, given the pairwise similarity between the training and testing data is available. Otherwise, it took 35.10 seconds to calculate the pairwise similarity between 2,341 testing data and 9,659 training data, averaging 0.015 seconds per testing log. Examples of detected outliers in the offline setting are presented in Table VIII. These outliers correspond to either system status changes or system errors/exceptions. In total, 161 outliers were detected.

### Patterns

Pattern examples are presented in Table IX. Compared with the patterns generated by SLCT on each individual log type, HLAer finds more general patterns.
