We applied SLCT on our datasets for comparison purpose. SLCT requires the deliminator to be specified as input and only works on homogeneous log types. Even though, we applied SLCT on the combination of Failure and HPC with comma as the specified delimiter and support 10. SLCT generates 46 clusters and 987 outliers. Interestingly, almost all the logs from HPC are classified as outliers. This may because although HPC has more intrinsic formats and less frequent words. In addition, Table VII shows some examples of clusters from SLCT. Clearly, the first three clusters should be condensed into one cluster, since the only difference among the three is the numbers (actually the parameters) after “ambien =”. Similarly, the last five clusters should be condensed into one as well. In addition, in order to generate template, the clusters have some words, e.g., “empera”, “curren”, etc, which themselves do not have accurate18

In contrary, HLAer clusters such logs into one cluster due to the flexibility of the similarity measurement to encapsulate the different words in the template, whereas SLCT is very rigid relying only on frequent words. IPLoM has exactly the same problem as SLCT, since it only considered frequent identical words. For example, IPLoM generates two clusters with the templates “169563node25nodestatus11140990821running” and “231564node70nodestatus11177219541running” for the combined dataset Failure and HPC, but obviously these two should be condensed into one. In addition, IPLoM generates a huge amount of intermediate files during the process and puts a very high demand on I/O. Comparison with CLUTO: CLUTO is also applied for clustering purpose. Recursive bisection algorithm is used in CLUTO with 64 clusters with fssim as a similarity measure. The results are presented in Figure 13 and Figure 14 (the blue plots). 64 clusters are chosen for demonstration purposes. In the figures, the cluster ID has an offset to avoid overlap with other plots (the green plots). Both Figure 13 and Figure 14 demonstrate that in general, CLUTO also generates clusters that correspond to the datasets. The difference is CLUTO will not identify outliers but generate small clusters for those outliers (the blue dots between x-axis [1600:1800] in Figure 14). The agreement between OPTICS and CLUTO, both of which perform the clustering based on the inherent structure (i.e., pairwise similarity) of the data, indicates that fssim is effective in capturing the inherent structure of log data.D. Outlier detectionThe entire dataset of 12000 log records is randomly split into 5 folds equally, 4 as the training data and the last one as the testing data. It takes 0.053 seconds including I/O for the offline detection on a single CPU, 2.27e-5 seconds on average per each testing log record, given the pairwise similarity between the training data and testing data is available. Otherwise, it takes 35.10 seconds to calculate the pairwise similarity between 2341 testing data and 9659 training data, on average 0.015 seconds per each testing log. Examples of detected outliers in the offline setting are presented in Table VIII. These outliers correspond to either system status change or system errors/exceptions. In total, 161 outliers are detected. Please note that we use Table VIII to show the outliers detected during both clustering process as in Section VIII-C and the offline outlier detection process. In Table VIII,19
the outliers are the interaction of those from the two processes. For the clustering, all the 12000 logs records are used while in the offline outlier detection process, 4 out of 5 folds are used, and thus the outliers in the left 1 fold are also the outliers in the entire set.
