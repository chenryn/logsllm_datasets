I wrote a small Python program that uses the `curses` library to display some output on the screen. The program seems to work fine for my simple use case, and I run it from the command line.

However, I'm encountering an issue: when I kill the Python program, the terminal does not display properly. For example:
- Before running my Python `curses` program, the command `ls -al` displays correctly.
- After killing the Python `curses` program, the command `ls -al` does not display correctly.

What can I do to ensure that the terminal output is restored properly after I kill my Python `curses` program?

**Solution:**
To address this issue, you should call `curses.endwin()` before your program exits. This function restores the terminal to its normal state. If you do not call `curses.endwin()`, the terminal will remain in the `curses` mode, which can cause the display issues you are experiencing.

Here’s an example of how you can integrate `curses.endwin()` into your program:

```python
import curses

def main(stdscr):
    # Your curses code here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        curses.wrapper(main)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        curses.endwin()
```

By using `curses.wrapper(main)`, the `curses` library will automatically handle initialization and cleanup, including calling `curses.endwin()` if the program is interrupted. Alternatively, you can manually call `curses.endwin()` in a `finally` block or in an exception handler to ensure it is always executed, even if an error occurs.
