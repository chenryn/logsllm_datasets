User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can WhatsApp see whom I'm messaging? I realize WhatsApp has end-to-end encryption.

But, can WhatsApp see certain metadata, such as the following?


With whom I send &amp; receive messages
How many messages I send &amp; receive
When I send &amp; receive messages

Assistant: AFAIK, WhatsApp is closed source. And the data passes through their servers. And they have control on the keys used for encryption (because it is closed source). So on a security point of view, you should assume that they can read the content of the messages.

Whether they do it or no is a different question, but if privacy is important, you should not rely on WhatsApp.

Now to answer your precise questions:


  can WhatsApp see with whom I send &amp; receive messages


Of course they can. How could the know where to forward the messages?


  can WhatsApp see how many messages I send &amp; receive


Of course they can. I assume they have technical logs that should contain sender and recipient for each message. Such logs are required for the administration of a platform


  can WhatsApp see when I send &amp; receive messages


Of course they can, for the very same reason as for your first question
