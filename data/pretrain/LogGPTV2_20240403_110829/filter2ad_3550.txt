ABSTRACT
”Bitcoin is a rare case where practice seems to be ahead of
theory.” Joseph Bonneau et al. [3]
This tutorial aims to further close the gap between IT se-
curity research and the area of cryptographic currencies and
block chains. We will describe and refer to Bitcoin as an ex-
ample throughout the tutorial, as it is the most prominent
representative of such a system. It also is a good reference to
discuss the underlying block chain mechanics which are the
foundation of various altcoins and other derived systems. In
this tutorial, the topic of cryptographic currencies is solely
addressed from a technical IT security point-of-view. There-
fore we do not cover any legal, sociological, ﬁnancial or eco-
nomical aspects.
The tutorial is designed for participants with a solid IT se-
curity background but will not assume any prior knowledge
on cryptographic currencies. Thus, we will quickly advance
our discussion into core aspects of this ﬁeld.
This tutorial is a modiﬁed version of the tutorial held

INTRODUCTION
With a current market capitalization of approximately 9
billion dollars, Bitcoin has demonstrated that a decentral-
ized cryptographic currency which currently handles roughly
200.000 transactions per day [2] is technically possible. Since
its launch in 2009, by an entity referred to as Satoshi Nakamoto
[11], the topic of cryptographic currencies has attained wide-
spread recognition.
The new ﬁeld of cryptographic currencies and consensus
ledgers, commonly referred to as block chains (or blockchains),
is receiving increasing interest from various diﬀerent commu-
nities [10]. These communities are very diverse and amongst

technical enthusiasts, activist groups, re-
others include:
searchers from various disciplines, start-ups,
large enter-
prises, public authorities, banks, ﬁnancial regulators, busi-
ness men, investors and criminals. The scientiﬁc community
in general adapted to this emerging and fast moving ﬁeld
of cryptographic currencies and consensus ledgers relatively
slowly.
This was one reason that, for quite a while, the only re-
sources available have been the Bitcoin source code, blog-
forum-posts, mailing lists and other online publications. Also
the original Bitcoin paper [11] which initiated the hype was
published online without any prior peer-review. Following
the original publication spirit of the Bitcoin paper, a lot of
innovation in this ﬁeld has always come from the community
itself in form of online-publications and online-conversations
and not from established peer-reviewed scientiﬁc publishing.
This spirit of fast free software development, combined
with the business aspects of cryptographic currencies, as well
as the interests of today’s time-to-market focused industry,
produced a ﬂood of publications, whitepapers and proto-
types. This quickly advancing hype has led to an absence of
systematization and deﬁcits in the theoretical understanding
of this new domain.
This tutorial aims at further closing this gap and presents
a well-structured introduction to this broad ﬁeld from a
technical viewpoint. Since the archetype for modern cryp-
tographic currencies and consensus ledgers is Bitcoin, we
describe the inner workings of this protocol in detail and
discuss its relations to other derived systems.
2. METHODOLOGY
A web based challenge environment will be available on-
line for all participants during the tutorial. As a practical
exercise and a method of gamiﬁcation we hand out small
amounts of Bitcoin to the participants as a reward for solved
challenges during the tutorial. Therefore, we encourage all
participants to bring their laptops to be able to participate.
The challenges range from quiz questions, that can be solved
with the help of a browser, to small practical tasks.
During the tutorial, we provide various references for fur-
ther studies. Those references link to a comprehensive bib-
liography containing relevant scientiﬁc publications in this
ﬁeld as well as the most important online resources 1.

History of cryptocurrencies: This should give a quick
overview of the history of cryptographic currency research,
and their roots which date back to 1980’s and David Chaums
publications in that ﬁeld [4, 5, 6].
Ingredients for proof-of-work based cryptocurren-
cies: Here we quickly go through the required cryptographic
concepts for current mainstream cryptocurrencies and block
chains. This includes the notion of proof-of-work (PoW)
schemes [1, 7]. Thereby, we will cover the basic character-
istics of the schemes used in Bitcoin. The main goal of this
chapter is a recap to bring everybody on the same level for
the next chapter.
Bitcoin and block chain mechanics:
In this chap-
ter we outline how everything ﬁts together and forms a
PoW based cryptographic currency. Thereby, Bitcoin is
discussed as an archetype for cryptographic currencies and
PoW based consensus ledger design. We go over the basic
elements of Bitcoin and describe how they work e.g.: Blocks,
transactions, mining and the block chain, Bitcoin script-
ing language, transaction fees, block chain forks, double-
spending [12, 13, 3, 8]
Open challenges and outlook: We present and quickly
discuss currently unsolved challenges.

INTENDED AUDIENCE
This 75 minutes tutorial does not assume any prior knowl-
edge on cryptopgrahic currencies. We assume good general
knowledge of information security on a graduate CS student
level with a focus on security. The goal of this tutorial is to
present the knowledge from various sources in a structured
way and to provide researchers with the practical funda-
mentals of cryptocurrencies/block chains and practitioners
with the scientiﬁc background.
The key takeaways are: (I) the practical fundamentals
of PoW based cryptographic currencies, (II) a good under-
standing of the underlying block chain mechanics, (III) a
overview of the related literature in this ﬁeld
Since we address this topic mainly from a technical point-
of-view, we will not cover any legal, sociological, ﬁnancial or
purely economical aspects of cryptocurrencies.

security consultant. At the moment, he is working as IT se-
curity researcher at SBA Research, where he is also working
towards his Ph.D. degree on applications of cryptographic
currencies and resilience aspects of distributed systems. His
research interests include network security, applied cryptog-
raphy and cryptographic currencies.
Edgar Weippl is Research Director of SBA Research and
associate professor at TU Wien. After graduating with
a Ph.D. from the TU Wien, Edgar worked in a research
startup for two years. He then spent one year teaching as
an Assistant Professor at Beloit College, WI. From 2002
to 2004, while with the software vendor ISIS Papyrus, he
worked as a consultant in New York, NY and Albany, NY,
and in Frankfurt, Germany. In 2004 he joined the TU Wien
and founded the research center SBA Research together with
A Min Tjoa and Markus Klemen. Edgar is member of the
editorial board of Computers & Security (COSE), organizes
the ARES conference and is General Chair of SACMAT
2015, PC Chair of Esorics 2015 and General Chair of ACM
