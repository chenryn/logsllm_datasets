User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 io_resource_contention 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This piece of code checks for IO resource contention in the system. It does so by iterating through the IO utils of each device and checking if the maximum IO utils exceed the disk_ioutils_threshold. If there is contention, the function provides details on the device and the IO utils that exceed the threshold. It also suggests two possible causes of contention: competing processes outside the database and long transactions within the database. If there is contention, it is considered a root cause of the issue. If there is no contention, it is not a root cause.
