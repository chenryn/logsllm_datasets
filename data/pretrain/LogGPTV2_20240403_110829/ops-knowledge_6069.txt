User:  Please list the types of network topology diagrams you know and their application scenarios.
Assistant: 1. Star network topology: All devices are connected to a central switch or hub, and the central device acts as a central node. A network using a star topology will be more stable, because if any one device fails, only the connection to the failed device will be affected. 2. Bus network topology diagram: All devices are connected to the same bus (cable) by a bidirectional cable. All devices on the bus can share one cable, and this connection topology makes expansion and expansion very easy. But there is also a problem, if this cable breaks, then the whole network will be down. 3. Ring network topology diagram: In this topology, all devices can be connected to each other in a ring topology, and all devices are evenly distributed on this ring. This connection method performs very well when there are a lot of device interfaces. However, because it is difficult to debug after a failure, the ring topology is not suitable for use. 4. Tree (hierarchical) network topology diagram: In the tree topology, all devices are connected in a way to form a tree structure. The structure of this tree is like an inverted tree, the root node is connected to the switch of the company network, and the nodes similar to the branches are connected to other devices one by one. 5. Mesh (disordered) network topology: Any two devices in the network can be connected to each other without affecting each other. It can be used to establish a large-scale distributed network. There are many usage scenarios, such as data centers, Internet of Vehicles, etc. However, this type of connection can significantly increase the cost of the network and require more technical deployment staff.
