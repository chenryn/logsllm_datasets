**Log Analysis**

**Log Entry:**
```
2015-10-18 18:01:50,353 INFO [main] org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster: OutputCommitter set in config null
```

**Analysis:**
- **Exception Detected:** No exception is present.
- **Description:**
  - The log entry indicates that an instance of the `MRAppMaster` (part of the Hadoop MapReduce v2 framework) is currently running.
  - It specifies that the `OutputCommitter` configuration value is set to `null`.
  - This `null` value for the `OutputCommitter` suggests that no specific output committer has been configured for this job. 
  - However, the log does not indicate any error or abnormal condition. 

**Conclusion:**
- The log message does not signal any errors or issues requiring further investigation or action. The `null` value for `OutputCommitter` may be intentional, depending on the job's requirements. If this is expected behavior, no additional steps are necessary. If it is unexpected, you may want to review the job configuration to ensure it aligns with your intended setup.
