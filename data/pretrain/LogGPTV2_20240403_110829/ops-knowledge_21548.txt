User: I am wondering, is there a way to change the name of a script so that it is not called "python.exe" in the tasklist. The reason I am asking is that I am trying to make a batch file that run's a python script. I want the batch file to check to see if the script is already running. if the script is already running then the batch file will do nothing. Thanks
Assistant: I'd simply create a lockfile in the local filesystem and exit if this exists already.
