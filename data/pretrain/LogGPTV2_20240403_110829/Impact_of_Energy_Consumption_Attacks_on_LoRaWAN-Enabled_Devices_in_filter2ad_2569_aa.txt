### Abstract
The successful deployment of Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology in various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios, such as Outage Management Systems (OMS) in smart metering, relies on the low energy consumption of end devices. In this work, we conducted an experiment to demonstrate an on/off Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack to analyze its impact on the energy consumption of a LoRaWAN end device. The implemented attack manipulates the end device to remain in packet retransmission mode for several seconds. Our results show that the configurable parameters of LoRaWAN, which are essential for applications like OMS, are susceptible to energy consumption attacks. Specifically, when an on-off DoS attack is performed, the end device using Spreading Factor (SF) 12 consumes 92 times more energy due to packet retransmissions compared to the end node using SF 7 under no attack.

## 1. Introduction
Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have become an essential part of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) infrastructure, particularly for applications requiring low mobility and short communication messages [1]. Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a promising LPWAN technology that has gained significant attention recently. In the context of smart grids, LoRaWAN is well-suited for Outage Management Systems (OMS) in smart metering applications [2]. A centrally located LoRaWAN gateway can provide long-range communication for geographically dispersed devices in the smart metering infrastructure. However, the deployment of LoRaWAN in these applications relies on the low power consumption of the end devices. OMS requires continuous functioning of devices for automatic meter reading and during power outages [2]. Battery-powered LoRaWAN devices, especially Class A devices, have a finite battery lifetime, making energy consumption a critical concern.

In smart metering, escalation methods are used to determine if a problem affects a single transformer or a large-scale outage by analyzing outage notification messages from smart meters [2]. To ensure successful packet transmission rates for power consumption readings and outage alert notifications, LoRaWAN provides retransmission of packets in acknowledged mode. However, packet collision probability increases with retransmissions, leading to higher energy consumption as the end device must transmit more packets. Additionally, LoRaWAN does not employ algorithms like Carrier-Sense Multiple Access for collision avoidance. This makes it vulnerable to energy consumption attacks by adversaries aiming to deplete the energy of battery-powered LoRaWAN devices.

In this work, we conduct an experiment to perform an on/off DoS attack to manipulate the packet retransmission of a LoRaWAN end device in acknowledged transmission mode. We analyze the impact of the attack on the energy consumption of the LoRaWAN end device using Spreading Factor (SF) values of 7 and 12. Our results demonstrate the significant increase in energy consumption under on/off DoS attacks compared to normal operation.

## 2. Related Work
Most existing research on LoRaWAN has focused on reliability and low bandwidth issues in the Internet of Things (IoT) network. Only a few studies have highlighted the potential threats of energy consumption attacks on battery-powered LoRaWAN devices. Mikhaylov et al. [3] discussed the deployment of LoRaWAN nodes for wind turbine monitoring in smart grid infrastructure but did not address energy consumption in detail. Sisinni et al. [4] proposed an Adaptive Data Payload (ADP) to maximize battery exploitation but did not consider the impact of LoRaWAN parameters on power consumption. Samuhasilp et al. [2] analyzed the applications of LoRaWAN in smart grids but did not discuss energy consumption attacks.

Nguyen et al. [5] and Mikhaylov et al. [6] focused on energy depletion attacks on low-power wireless networks. Nguyen et al. [5] provided an overview of other LPWAN technologies but did not analyze LoRaWAN, while Mikhaylov et al. [6] experimentally validated the feasibility of energy attacks on LoRaWAN end devices. However, their experiments did not cover energy attacks in the acknowledged transmission mode, ignoring the influence of packet retransmissions on energy consumption.

Our work specifically focuses on the impact of spreading factors and retransmission attempts on the energy consumption of LoRaWAN devices under an on/off DoS attack. Most IIoT applications require packet retransmissions for fair delivery, and different SFs may be used based on environmental conditions. Frequent retransmissions and high SF values can significantly increase transmission time and, consequently, energy consumption.

## 3. Approach
Our primary goal is to examine the overall impact of energy consumption attacks on LoRaWAN devices. These attacks often involve manipulating configurable parameters to keep the end-device in a longer period of energy-consuming tasks, such as transmission mode. We briefly explain the key parameters of LoRaWAN that influence power consumption under such attacks.

### Spreading Factor (SF)
Spreading Factor (SF) is a key variable in LoRa and significantly impacts power consumption and the range of LoRaWAN communication. LoRa uses SF values ranging from 7 to 12, corresponding to data rates from DR5 to DR0. Higher SF values increase signal sensitivity but also increase the airtime for message transmission [7]. Longer airtime directly affects the energy consumption of LoRaWAN devices, as they spend more time transmitting signals.

### Receive Windows
All end-devices open two receive windows after every uplink transmission. LoRaWAN uses this feature for downlink messages from the gateway to the end-devices. The first receive window (RX1) uses the uplink spreading factor by default, while the second receive window (RX2) uses a fixed SF of 12. The duration of each receive window depends on the time required to detect the downlink preamble. The time spent waiting for downlink transmissions can significantly impact the battery life of LoRaWAN devices.

### Energy Consumption Attacks
These attacks aim to reduce the lifetime of battery-powered devices [6]. Adversaries can scan the radio channel to identify receive window configurations and send messages from a rogue gateway using the same SF as the RX1 configuration of the victimâ€™s device with high transmitting power. This can cause the device to spend more time detecting the full packet until a valid preamble is detected, as the Message Integrity Check (MIC) bit is located at the end of the LoRaWAN packet [6].

To extend this attack scenario, we conducted an experiment to demonstrate an on/off DoS attack on sensor nodes by flooding the device with unauthenticated messages for short intervals. The adversary can execute this attack opportunistically without being detected. If the device is enabled with...
