ABSTRACT 
Successful  deployment  of  Long-Range  Wide  Area  Network 
(LoRaWAN)  technology  in  several  Industrial  Internet  of  Things 
(IIoT)  scenarios,  such  as  Outage  Management  System  (OMS)  in 
smart  metering,  rely  on  low  energy  consumption  of  the  end 
device. In this work, we conducted an experiment to demonstrate 
an on/off Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack to analyze the impact on 
the  energy  consumption  of  the  LoRaWAN  end  device.  We 
implemented the attack that manipulates the end device to remain 
in packet retransmission mode for several seconds. The conducted 
experiments show that the configurable parameters of LoRaWAN 
that  are  required  for  applications,  like  OMS,  are  susceptible  to 
energy  consumption  attacks.  In  summary,  our  results  show  that 
when an on-off DoS attack is performed, the end device utilizing 
the Spreading Factor (SF) 12 consumes 92 times more energy due 
to packet retransmissions as compared to the end node using SF 7 
under no attack.

1  INTRODUCTION 
Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have emerged as an 
essential  part  of  the 
Industrial  Internet  of  Things  (IIoT) 
infrastructure for applications that require low mobility and short 
communication  messages  [1].  Long-Range  Wide  Area  Network 
(LoRaWAN)  is  a  promising  technology  in  LPWAN,  which  has

received  significant  attention  lately.  In  the  context  of  the  smart 
grid,  LoRaWAN  appears  to  be  quite  suitable  for  the  Outage 
Management  System  (OMS)  in  smart  metering  applications  [2]. 
Centrally  located  single  LoRaWAN  gateway  can  provide  long-
range communication for geographically dispersed devices in the 
smart  metering  infrastructure.  However,  the  vision  of  deploying 
LoRaWAN  in  aforesaid  application  relies  on  the  low  power 
consumption  of  the  end  devices.  The  OMS  requires  continuous 
functioning  of  the  devices  for  automatic  meter  reading  and  also 
during  the  power  outages  [2].  The  battery-powered  LoRaWAN 
devices  of  Class  A  have  a  finite  battery  lifetime;  therefore,  the 
energy consumption of such devices holds paramount importance. 
In  smart  metering,  the escalation  method  is  usually  employed  to 
determine if there is a problem in  a single transformer or if it is 
affected  by  a  large-scale  outage  using  the  outage  notifications 
messages from smart meters [2]. In this direction, the utility needs 
to  ensure  the  successful  packet  transmission  rate  for  power 
consumption  reading  and  outage  alert  notifications.  LoRaWAN 
provides  retransmission  of  packets  in  acknowledged  mode  to 
ensure fair packet delivery. However, packet collision probability 
also  increases  with  the  retransmission  of  packets  that  can  cost 
more  energy  consumption  as  the  end  device  is  now  required  to 
transmit  more  packets.  Moreover,  LoRaWAN  protocol  does  not 
employ  algorithms  such  as  Carrier-Sense  Multiple  Access  for 
collision  avoidance.  Consequently,  the  adversaries  can  exploit 
vulnerabilities to perform energy consumption attacks in order to 
deplete the energy of the battery-powered LoRaWAN devices. 
In this work, we conduct an experiment to perform an on/off DoS 
attack to manipulate the packet retransmission of the LoRaWAN 
end device in acknowledged  transmission mode.  To this end, we 
analyze  the  impact  of  the  attack  on  energy  consumption  of  the 
LoRaWAN end device utilizing the Spreading Factor (SF) values of 
7  and  12.  Most  importantly,  our  work  demonstrates  the  impact 
through  observed  results  of  energy  consumption  of  the  packet 
transmission under on/off DoS against the energy consumption of 
the transmitted packets under no attack. 
2  RELATED WORK 
Until  recently,  most  of  the  existing  research  focused  on  the 
reliability and low bandwidth issues of LoRaWAN in the Internet 
of Things (IoT) network. There are only a few works that highlight 
the  potential  threats  of  energy  consumption  attacks  on  the 
battery-powered  LoRaWAN  devices.  Mikhaylov  et  al.  [3] 
considered  the  deployment  of  LoRaWAN  nodes  for  the  wind

turbine  monitoring  in  smart  grid  infrastructure.  However,  the 
work only provides a high-level discussion on the suitability of the 
LoRaWAN network in energy infrastructure. To maximize battery 
exploitation, Sisinni et al. [4] proposed an Adaptive Data Payload 
(ADP)  as  an  alternative  to  the  Adaptive  Data  Rate  (ADR) 
algorithm  to  equalize  the  message  time  duration  for  the  whole 
smart metering lifetime. The work, however, does not address the 
impact  of  built-in  parameters  of  LoRaWAN  on  its  power 
consumption.  Samuhasilp  et  al.  [2]  analyzed  the  applications  of 
LoRaWAN  technology  in  the  smart  grid.  In  this  context,  they 
explained how LoRaWAN devices can be incorporated into smart 
metering  for  OMS.  This  work  does  not  discuss  the  energy 
consumption attacks and the influence of LoRaWAN parameters. 
Like our work, Nguyen et al. [5] and Mikhaylov et al. [6] focused 
on  the  energy  depletion  attacks  on  the  low  power  wireless 
network.  Nguyen  et  al.  [5]    presented  a  systematic  overview  of 
other  LPWAN  technologies  but  did  not  analyze  the  LoRaWAN 
technology  concerning  energy  depletion  attacks,  whereas, 
Mikhaylov et al. [6] experimentally validated the feasibility of the 
energy  attacks  on  LoRaWAN  end  devices.  The  experiments, 
however,  do  not  cover  the  energy  attacks  in  the  acknowledged 
transmission mode  of the end device. Therefore, the influence of 
the  retransmission  of  packets  on  energy  consumption  was 
ignored. Our work specifically focuses on the impact of spreading 
factors  and  retransmission  attempts  of  the  packets  on  energy 
consumption  of  the  LoRaWAN  under  an  on/off  DoS  attack.  We 
realize that most applications in IIoT require the retransmission of 
packets for fair packet delivery. In addition, these applications may 
utilize  different  SFs  according  to  the  environmental  conditions 
between the end device and the gateway. In this context, frequent 
packet retransmissions and high values of SF can account to more 
transmission time, therefore, both parameters are quite significant 
with respect to energy consumption of LoRaWAN end devices. 
3  APPROACH 
Our  main  goal  of  this  work  is  to  examine  the  overall  impact  of 
energy  consumption  attacks  on  LoRaWAN  devices.  In  this 
direction, energy consumption attacks often entail manipulation of 
configurable parameters of LoRaWAN to keep the end-device in a 
longer  period  of  energy-consuming  tasks  such  as  transmission 
mode. To find the influence of such parameters, we briefly explain 
the  key  parameters  of  LoRaWAN  that  can  influence  the  power 
consumption  of  the  end  device  under  the  energy  consumption 
attack. 
Spreading Factor (SF). It is a key variable in Long-Range (LoRa) 
and has a significant impact on power consumption and the range 
of  LoRaWAN  communication.  Each  SF  has  an  orthogonal  signal 
and LoRa uses the SF values ranged from 7 to 12 (that correspond 
to data rates from DR5 to DR0, respectively). The greater value of 
SF increases the sensitivity of the signal, however, time-on-air for 
the  message  transmission  also  gets  increased  [7].  To  this  end, 
airtime of the messages directly impacts the energy consumption 
of the LoRaWAN devices, since the devices spend more time in the 
energy-consuming tasks of transmitting the signal. 
Receive Windows. All  end-devices  open  two  receive  windows 
after  every  uplink  transmission.  LoRaWAN  uses  this  feature  for 
the downlink messages from the gateway to the LoRaWAN end-
devices.  The  uplink  spreading  factor  is  used  for  the  first  receive 
window (RX1) by default, while the second receive window (RX2) 
uses  a  fixed  spreading  factor  of  12.  To  this  end,  the  duration  of 
each receive window depends on the time required to detect the 
downlink  preamble.  Receive  window  is  a  critical  parameter  with 
respect  to  energy  consumption  since  the  time  spent  waiting  for 
the  downlink  transmission  can  directly  impact  the  lifetime  of 
battery-powered LoRaWAN devices. 
Energy  Consumption  Attacks.  These  attacks  aim 
to 
significantly  reduce  the  lifetime  of  battery-powered  devices  [6]. 
The adversaries can scan the radio channel to see receive window 
configurations that are publicly available. Next, messages from the 
rogue  gateway  can  be  sent  using  the  same  SF  as  of  the  RX1 
configuration of the victim’s device with high transmitting power. 
In turn, the packets received in the RX1 can account for more time 
in  detecting  the  full  packet  until  the  valid  preamble  is  detected 
since the Message Integrity Check (MIC) bit is located at the end of 
the LoRaWAN’s packet [6]. 
To  extend  this  attack  scenario,  we  run  an  experiment  to 
demonstrate  an  on/off  Denial-of-Service  (DoS)  attack  on  sensor 
nodes  by  flooding  the  device  with  unauthenticated  messages  for 
short intervals (wisely striking on/off attack waveforms that cause 
a  denial  of  service).  The  adversary  can  opportunistically  execute 
this  attack  without  being  detected.  If  the  device  is  enabled  with
