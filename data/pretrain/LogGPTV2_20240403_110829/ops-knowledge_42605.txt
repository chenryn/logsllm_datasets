User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is certificate pinning? I'm superficially familiar with SSL and what certs do. Recently I saw some discussion on cert pinning but there wasn't a definition. A DDG search didn't turn up anything useful. What is certificate pinning?

Assistant: Typically certificates are validated by checking the signature hierarchy; MyCert is signed by IntermediateCert which is signed by RootCert, and RootCert is listed in my computer's "certificates to trust" store.

Certificate Pinning was where you ignore that whole thing, and say trust this certificate only or perhaps trust only certificates signed by this certificate, ignoring all the other root CAs that could otherwise be trust anchors. It was frequently also known as Key Pinning, since it was actually the public key hash that got saved.

But in practice, Key Pinning turned out to cause more problems than it solved. It was frequently misconfigured by site owners, plus in the event of a site compromise, attackers could maliciously pin a cert that the site owner didn't control. Key Pinning was deprecated in 2017, and was removed entirely from Chrome and Firefox in Nov. 2019. It was never supported to begin with by IE and Safari.

The recommended replacement is to use the Expect-CT header to tell browsers to require that the cert show up in Certificate Transparency logs.
