a reasonably small transition bandwidth. As an example,
when the sampling frequency is 8000Hz as common for voice
signals, we set the stopband bandwidth as ±1Hz, and the
transition bandwidth as 8Hz. If the equiripple linear-phase
design is adopted, the ﬁlter has a length of 3627 samples,
which corresponds to a duration of about half a second.
To illustrate the eﬀect of bandstop ﬁltering, we show in
Fig. 2(a) a typical Fourier analysis result on a 10-minute
audio recording. There is a salient peak located at 60Hz,
which signiﬁes the existence of the ENF signal. The eﬀect
of bandstop ﬁltering for the same audio recording is shown

in Fig. 2(b), wherein the peak at 60Hz disappears, suggest-
ing that the ENF signal has been removed. The removal
is further justiﬁed by comparing the normalized correlation
between the ENF signal extracted from power mains ground
truth and the ENF signal extracted from the audio record-
ing. We notice that the normalized correlation reduces from
0.86 to −0.10 due to bandstop ﬁltering, suggesting that the
ENF signal has been eﬀectively removed. Furthermore, our
subjective tests do not ﬁnd perceptual audio quality loss,
meaning that the ENF signal removal preserves the host
signal.
Although bandstop ﬁltering can remove the ENF signal, a
notch of very low magnitude around the 60Hz frequency can
be noticed in Fig. 2(b). The notch is a strong evidence that
suggests the use of bandstop ﬁltering, making the result-
ing audio recording no longer trustworthy and hence anti-
forensics essentially fails. To erase such traces, an option is
to “ﬁll in” the frequency region that has been suppressed by
bandstop ﬁltering. We design a bandpass ﬁlter with pass-
band bandwidth ±1Hz and transition bandwidth 8Hz and
pass a white noise signal through the ﬁlter to obtain a nar-
rowband signal that is then added to the bandstopped audio
recording. The noise power is selected so that the result-
ing narrowband magnitude equals the average magnitude of
neighboring narrowbands, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Since the
narrowband now appears smooth and there is no peak at
60Hz, it becomes more diﬃcult for the forensic analyst to
determine if there was measurable ENF signal present at
60Hz.
3.2 Embedding Phony ENF Signals
In addition to removing the ENF signal so that the record-
ing time of an audio recording is no longer available, an ad-
versary may further embed a fake ENF signal into a host
signal so that ENF analysis conducted over the forged audio
signal leads to a wrong estimate for the recording time. This
can be done by modulating a carrier sinusoidal signal of a
nominal frequency using a given sequence of instantaneous
frequencies. In mathematical terms, the carrier signal can
be written as
c(t) = A cos(2πfct).

Next, we discuss how to embed a modulated signal into a
host signal. As in Section 3.1, we ﬁrst apply a bandstop ﬁlter
on the host signal and then ﬁll in bandpassed noise whose
magnitude is matched to neighborhood regions. The mag-
nitude A in (2) is chosen so that the peak FFT magnitude
at the nominal frequency remains the same after the anti-
forensic operation, as shown in Fig. 3. This can be achieved
using a binary search procedure: starting with a guess of A,
each iteration compares the resulting peak FFT magnitude
to the targeted value and increases/decreases A accordingly.
We consider two possible types of synthetic ENF signals.
If there is no real ENF signal from another time or another
power grid available for embedding, one can embed a purely
artiﬁcial signal such as the sinusoidal variation as shown in
Fig. 4(a). The resulting spectrogram has a strong compo-
nent around 60Hz as shown in Fig. 4(b), and the ENF signal
extracted from the forged audio signal is shown in Fig. 4(c),
which is a noisy version of Fig. 4(a) since the embedded
signal has been mixed into the narrowband. On the other
hand, if a real ENF signal originated from a diﬀerent time or
from another power grid is available, then such a ENF signal
can also be embedded into the host signal to mislead foren-
sic analysis. Fig. 5(a) shows a power mains ground truth
ENF signal, and the corresponding extracted ENF is shown
in Fig. 5(b). We can see that the embedded ENF can also
be extracted in a more noisy form.
The proposed embedding above is based on the FM syn-
thesis. Alternatively, one can perform a “transplantation”
operation to duplicate the ENF signal from one signal into
another signal. Speciﬁcally, to embed an ENF signal present
in a source audio signal into a host signal, we perform band-
pass and bandstop ﬁltering upon the source and the host
signal, respectively, and then add the bandpassed output of
the source signal into the bandstopped output of the host
signal.
In Fig. 6(a), we show the spectrogram of a trans-

and the resulting signal are shown in Fig. 6(b). The obser-
vation that they overlap tightly indicates the eﬀectiveness
of the transplantation from an anti-forensic point of view.
4. DETECTING ANTI-FORENSICS
Our study in Section 3 has shown a number of anti-forensic
operations that can counteract ENF analysis. In response
to these operations, a forensic analyst would devise ways to
detect the use of anti-forensic operations, so that a forged
audio signal can be identiﬁed and rejected as trustworthy
evidence. In this section, we ﬁrst discuss conditions under
which the detection is feasible, and then propose eﬀective
detection methods.
4.1 Detectability of Anti-Forensic Operations
In order to detect anti-forensic operations, we ﬁrst provide
a mathematical formulation of the anti-forensic operations
discussed in Section 3. Without loss of generality, the anti-
forensic operations proposed therein create a forged audio
signal by mixing a bandstopped input signal and a band-
passed alien signal (either real or synthetic).
In the fre-
quency domain, the overall anti-forensic operation can be
represented as
Y (ω) = e−jαω
[X(ω)Bs(ω) + E(ω)Bp(ω)] ,
(3)
where X(ω) is the frequency-domain representation of the
original audio signal indexed by the frequency ω (in Hz),
Y (ω) is the resulting audio signal, E(ω) is the alien signal,
Bs(ω) and Bp(ω) are the frequency responses of the band-
stop ﬁlter and the bandpass ﬁlter, respectively, and e−jαω is
a phase shift corresponding to a possible time-domain delay
of α. The delay is introduced to avoid imperfect boundary
conditions due to ﬁltering.
Consider two mutually exclusive cases. For the frequency
outside the narrow passband, |Bs(ω)| ≈1 and |Bp(ω)| ≈ 0,
and we have
|Y (ω)| ≈ |X(ω)|,
∠Y (ω) ≈ −αω + ∠X(ω) +∠ Bs(ω).
(4)
In practice, both the bandstop and the bandpass ﬁlters can
be designed as zero-phase or linear-phase. As such, the
phase term ∠Bs(ω) is linear outside the narrowband, and
by properly selecting the delay α, the two terms −αω and
∠Bs(ω) can be cancelled out, leading to Y (ω) ≈ X(ω) out-
side the narrowband. In other words, the anti-forensic op-
erations basically preserve the host signal outside the nar-
rowband. On the other hand, for the frequency inside the
narrowband, we have |Bs(ω)| ≈0 and |Bp(ω)| ≈1, and
|Y (ω)| ≈ |E(ω)|,
∠Y (ω) ≈ −αω + ∠E(ω) + ∠Bp(ω)
≈ ∠E(ω) + (β − α)ω
(5)
provided that the bandpass ﬁlter has linear phase in the nar-
rowband. This suggests Y (ω) ≈ e(β−α)ωE(ω), that is, the
output signal inside the narrowband resembles the alien sig-
nal inside the narrowband with a possible phase shift. If the
bandstop and bandpass ﬁlters are designed using the same
methods, then α and β are similar and thus the phase shift
is close to zero. To summarize, overall the proposed anti-
432forensic operations from Section 3 only alter the narrowband
and leave no substantial inﬂuence outside the narrowband.
In order to detect anti-forensic operations, a forensic an-
alyst can carry out a likelihood ratio (LR) test to compare
the likelihoods of a forged audio signal and an unforged au-
dio signal. Speciﬁcally, the analyst evaluates the following
likelihood ratio:
LR =
=
=
P (Y |forged)
P (Y |unforged)
P (O = o, I = i|forged)
P (O = o, I = i|unforged)
P (I = i|forged, O = o)
P (I = i|unforged, O = o)
(6)
(7)
,
where we decompose Y into a pair of (I, O) in (6), stand-
ing for the inside-narrowband and outside-narrowband com-
ponents, respectively, and the terms P (O = o|forged) and
P (O = o|unforged) are cancelled out in (7) since the anti-
forensic operations do not aﬀect the host signal outside the
narrowband.
For the anti-forensic operations proposed in Section 3, the
forged narrowband is independent of the signal outside the
narrowband. Therefore, the numerator in (7) can be written
as PEI (i), standing for the likelihood of observing a narrow-
band i conditioned that the narrowband is from an alien
signal. The denominator, on the other hand, has to account
for the dependence of the narrowband on the signal outside
the narrowband. Speciﬁcally, the denominator can be de-
noted as PXI,o(i), which is the likelihood of a narrowband i
given that the narrowband is native (i.e., not from another
signal) and the signal outside the narrowband is o. In sum-
mary, the likelihood ratio is given by PEI (i)/PXI,o(i).
From such an analysis, we see that a distinction has to
be made between the original audio signal X and the alien
signal E in the narrowband, in order to detect anti-forensics
operations. This is, however, a challenging task, since the
adversary can design the bandstop ﬁlter to make the nar-
rowband very “narrow”, especially compared to the wide
frequency range associated with the much higher sampling
frequency. As a result, the characteristics of the original
audio signal X and the alien signal E cannot be easily dis-
tinguished in the narrowband. To illustrate such a diﬃculty
for the forensic analyst, Fig. 7(a) shows the overall phase of
an unforged audio signal as well as its forged version, and
their diﬀerence is hardly noticeable. Zooming into the nar-
rowband as shown in Fig. 7(b), we observe that the two ver-
sions diﬀer in the narrowband, but it is not straightforward
to characterize their statistical diﬀerence and to determine
which one is forged.
4.2 Inter-Frequency Consistency Check
Section 4.1 shows that anti-forensic operations can be de-
tected if one can distinguish the two distributions PEI (i) and
PXI,o(i) in the likelihood ratio. Motivated by this ﬁnding,
we propose a few ways toward this end.
We have considered so far the scenario that a forensic an-
alyst only extracts ENF signals from a given frequency (e.g.,
