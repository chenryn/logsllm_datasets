### Procedure for Collecting Troubleshooting Information for IBM MQ

#### 1. Generate an MSCS Cluster Log After the Problem Occurs
1. **On one of the cluster members:**
   a. Start PowerShell (or run the `PowerShell` command in a DOS prompt).
   b. Navigate to the IBM MQ top-level errors directory:
      ```powershell
      PS C:\> CD $env:ProgramData\IBM\MQ\Errors
      ```
   c. Run the `Get-ClusterLog` cmdlet to generate cluster logs for the nodes in the cluster:
      ```powershell
      PS C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\Errors> Get-ClusterLog -Destination
      ```

#### 2. Run the IBM MQ `amqmsysn` Utility
- Use the `amqmsysn` utility to display information about all IBM MQ executables and libraries on both members of the cluster.
- Save this information to a file, for example, `%TEMP%\MQ.exeinfo.txt`.

#### 3. Generate a High-Detail MQ Trace
- On both members of the cluster during the problem, generate a high-detail MQ trace:
  ```cmd
  C:\> strmqtrc -e -t all -t detail
  ...
  C:\> endmqtrc -a
  ```

#### 4. Show the Registry Checkpoints
- On both members of the cluster, show the registry checkpoints:
  ```cmd
  C:\> CLUSTER RESOURCE /CHECKPOINTS > %TEMP%\Cluster.checkpoints.txt
  ```

#### 5. Check the Registry Checkpoints
- Verify the registry checkpoints on both cluster members.

#### 6. Save Event Viewer Logs
- Save all three Event Viewer logs (System, Application, and Security) on both members of the cluster.

#### 7. Place Cluster Logs and Command Outputs
- Place the cluster logs, error logs, and command outputs from Steps 1 and 2 directly in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory on each member of the cluster.

#### 8. Collect IBM MQ Data
- You can collect the data either automatically or manually:
  - **Automatically:**
    - Use the `runmqras` command on both cluster members as described in “Collecting troubleshooting information automatically with runmqras” on page 303.
    - Ensure you collect the `runmqras` trace section and specify your case number:
      ```cmd
      runmqras -section trace -qmlist QMA -caseno TS001234567
      ```
  - **Manually:**
    - Follow the instructions in “Collecting troubleshooting information manually” on page 306.

#### 9. Send the Collected Information to IBM
- Provide a detailed description of the problem along with the collected data.
- Do not send data without providing a description.
- For FTP and email instructions, see "Exchanging information with IBM Software Support."
- To open or update a case, go to the IBM My Support site.
- Always update your case to indicate that data was sent.
- If you need to speak with IBM Software Support, contact your country representative. In the US, you can call 1-800-IBM-SERV.

### Additional Procedures for Specific Issues

#### Collecting Information for MQIPT Problems
1. **Synchronize System Clocks:**
   - Synchronize the system clock on each computer involved, including those running IBM MQ and MQIPT.
   - This helps to match trace entries in different trace files.

2. **Move Old Trace Files:**
   - Move old trace files to a backup directory so that new trace files contain information related only to the current problem.

3. **Turn On Trace for Affected Routes:**
   - Turn on trace for all routes affected by the problem.
   - For more information, see “Tracing errors in IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru” on page 419.

4. **Reproduce the Problem:**
   - Run the client to reproduce the problem and create new trace files.

5. **Send Relevant Files:**
   - Send a copy of all MQIPT `.TRC`, `.FDC`, and `.log` files.
   - Also, send a simple network diagram of all the computers used between the IBM MQ endpoints, including firewalls, routers, load balancers, and servers. Include the name, IP address, and relevant port numbers for each computer.

6. **Send the Information to IBM:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 9 above.

#### Collecting Information for Publish/Subscribe Problems
1. **Generate Java or JMS Trace:**
   - If the problem affects an IBM MQ classes for Java or IBM MQ classes for JMS application, generate the appropriate trace.
   - If your application is running under WebSphere Application Server, follow the trace instructions for that environment.

2. **Generate Queue Manager Trace:**
   - Generate a trace of the queue manager when the publish/subscribe problem occurs.
   - Refer to the tracing instructions for your specific platform:
     - “Tracing on AIX and Linux” on page 376
     - “Tracing on Windows” on page 391
     - “Tracing on IBM i” on page 381

3. **Save `mqconfig` Output:**
   - On Linux and UNIX systems, save the output from the `mqconfig` command.

4. **Place `mqconfig` Output:**
   - Place the `mqconfig` output in the top-level IBM MQ errors directory.

5. **Collect IBM MQ Data:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 8 above.

6. **Send the Information to IBM:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 9 above.

#### Collecting Information for RDQM Problems
1. **Collect `runmqras` Output:**
   - Collect the `runmqras` output from each RDQM node using the `mqm` user:
     ```cmd
     sudo runmqras -qmlist rdqmName -section defs,trace -caseno casenumber
     ```
   - Note: The `-caseno` option works in specific versions of IBM MQ. For more information, see the notes in the procedure.

2. **Provide `/var/log/messages` File:**
   - Provide the `/var/log/messages` file from all three nodes, including any archived syslog files that might contain activity from the date of the problem.

3. **Provide `/var/log/pacemaker.log` File:**
   - Provide the `/var/log/pacemaker.log` file from all three nodes, including any archived pacemaker.log files that might contain activity from the date of the problem.

4. **Send the Information to IBM:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 9 above.

#### Collecting Information for Security Problems
1. **Generate Queue Manager Trace:**
   - Generate a trace of the queue manager when the security problem occurs.
   - Issue the `runmqsc REFRESH SECURITY` command just before tracing if possible.

2. **Display User Information:**
   - Display information about the user, particularly the groups to which the user belongs.
   - For example, on UNIX and Linux:
     ```sh
     sh> id watson > /tmp/watson.id.txt
     sh> groups watson > /tmp/watson.groups.txt
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     C:\> NET USER "Thomas Watson" > %TEMP%\watson.user.txt
     ```
   - On IBM i:
     ```ibmi
     ===> DSPUSRPRF USER(WATSON) OUTPUT(*PRINT)
     Then use WRKSPLF option 5 to display the joblog from QPUSRPRF
     ```

3. **Collect IBM MQ Data:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 8 above.

4. **Send the Information to IBM:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 9 above.

#### Collecting Information for TLS Channel Problems
1. **Generate Queue Manager Trace:**
   - Generate a trace of the queue manager when the TLS problem occurs.
   - Use the correct options for a queue manager TLS trace: `-t all -t detail`.

2. **Generate Simultaneous Trace:**
   - Generate an IBM MQ trace simultaneously at the other end of the channel, whether it is another queue manager or a client application.

3. **Collect IBM MQ Data:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 8 above.

4. **Send the Information to IBM:**
   - Follow the same steps as in Step 9 above.

#### Collecting Information for Triggering Problems
- Follow the same steps as in the previous sections, ensuring you gather the necessary traces and logs related to the triggering issue.
