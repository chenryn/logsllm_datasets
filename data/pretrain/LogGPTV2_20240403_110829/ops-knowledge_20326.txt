User: There is a default python version, namely python 2.6, on the GPU server with Linux OS. Now I want to install a new python version on the server from its source, namely python 2.7. I should not change the default python version since I am not the administrator and some reason. So what should I do?
Assistant: To build on Tryph's answer, you can install that new version to your home directory, then in a directory specified within your PATH (like in .bash_profile), you can point to that directory and within there create a sym-link that points to the new python.
For instance, if you have a bin folder in your home directory that is specified in the path

ln -s /bin/python ~/bin/python
