User: How to deploy and manage Docker, and realize the operation, deletion and network connection of containers?
Assistant: The deployment and management of Docker mainly involves the following aspects: 1. Install Docker: On the machine that needs to manage Docker, install the Docker software and start the Docker service. 2. Create an image: According to your own needs, select a basic image and build your own application on it. You can use Dockerfile to build an application image, or download an existing image from Docker Hub and modify it. 3. Run the container: use the Docker command run to start a container, and specify parameters such as the image to be run and the name of the container. You can also create a group of containers to form an application for deployment. 4. Container management: Use Docker commands to manage containers, such as stopping, restarting, deleting, and viewing container information. 5. Container network: Docker supports multiple network modes, and containers can be connected to the same network to achieve communication between containers. The following are some examples of commands: 1. Install Docker: ```bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install docker-ce sudo systemctl start docker ``` 2. Create an image: ```bash # Use Dockerfile to create an image docker build -t myimage:1.0 . # Download the image from Docker Hub docker pull nginx ``` 3. Run the container: ```bash # Run an nginx container docker run --name mynginx -d -p 8080:80 nginx # background Run a container docker run -d myimage ``` 4. Container management: ```bash # View the running container docker ps # Stop the container docker stop mynginx # View the container log docker logs mynginx # Delete the container docker rm mynginx ``` 5. Container network: ```bash # Create a custom network docker network create mynetwork # Run the container and connect to the network docker run --name mycontainer --network mynetwork myimage ``` The above are some basic Docker deployment and management Example, the specific use needs to be adjusted and detailed processing according to the actual scene.
