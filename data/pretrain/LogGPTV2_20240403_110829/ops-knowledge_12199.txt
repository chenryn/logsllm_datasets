User: How to use Python language to realize automated testing of web applications?
Assistant: The automated testing of web applications can be done using the Python language and the selenium library. The steps are as follows: 1. Install Python and selenium libraries. 2. Write the test script. 3. Start the browser and open the website under test. 4. Position the page element. 5. Operate on elements. 6. Assert whether the test results meet expectations. 7. Close the browser. Sample code: ```python from selenium import webdriver # Start the browser browser = webdriver.Chrome() # Open the website under test browser.get("http://www.example.com") # Locate the page element search_box = browser .find_element_by_name("q") search_button = browser.find_element_by_name("btnK") # Operate on elements search_box.send_keys("Python") search_button.click() # Assert whether the test results meet expectations assert "Python" in browser.title # Close the browser browser.quit() ``` The above is a simple example, which completes the function of searching for Python in Google and verifying whether the keyword "Python" is included in the search results. More complex test cases can be written according to specific test requirements.
