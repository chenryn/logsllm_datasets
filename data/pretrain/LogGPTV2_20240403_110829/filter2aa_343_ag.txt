The individual services of Mac OS X Server version 10.3 and later do not require any 
configuration for single signon or Kerberos. The following services are ready for 
Kerberos and single signon on every server with Mac OS X Server version 10.3 and later 
that is an Open Directory master or has joined one:
• Login window
• Mail service
• FTP
• AFP service
• SSH
These services are “Kerberized” whether they are running or not.
Setting Up an Open Directory Master for Single Signon and 
Kerberos
You can provide single signon and Kerberos authentication on your network by setting 
up an Open Directory master. You can set up an Open Directory master during the 
initial configuration that follows installation of Mac OS X Server version 10.3 and later. If 
you have set up Mac OS X Server to have a different Open Directory role, you can 
change its role to that of Open Directory master by using Server Admin.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
A server that is an Open DIrectory master requires no additional configuration to 
support single signon and Kerberos authentication for all the Kerberized services that 
the server itself provides. This server can also support single signon and Kerberos 
authentication for Kerberized services of other servers on the network. The other 
servers must be set up to join the Open Directory master for single signon and 
Kerberos.
For instructions, see the getting started guide, “Setting Up an Open Directory Master” 
on page 56, “Delegating Authority to Join an Open Directory Master for Single Signon 
and Kerberos” on page 62, and “Joining a Server to an Open Directory Master for Single 
Signon and Kerberos” on page 63.
Delegating Authority to Join an Open Directory Master for Single 
Signon and Kerberos
Using Server Admin, you can delegate the authority to join a server to an Open 
Directory master for single signon and Kerberos authentication. You can delegate 
authority to one or more user accounts on one server. The user accounts to which you 
are delegating authority must have a password type of Open Directory and must reside 
in the LDAP directory of the Open Directory master. The server for which you are 
delegating authority must have Mac OS X Server version 10.3 or later.
If you want to delegate authority for more than one server, repeat this procedure for 
each one.
Important:  If a delegated administrator’s account is deleted and recreated on the 
target server, the new account will not have authority to join the Kerberos server. As a 
precaution, you should delegate authority to at least two accounts on the target server. 
One account can belong to a network administrator (an administrator of the Kerberos 
domain). 
To delegate authority to join an Open Directory master for single signon and 
Kerberos:
1 Open Workgroup Manager, make sure the target server has been added to a computer 
account in the LDAP directory domain of the server from which you’re delegating 
authority, and note the name of the target server in the computer account.
2 The name of the target server in the computer account corresponds to the name of the 
server’s computer record in the LDAP directory domain. Adding the server to a 
computer account creates a computer record for the server. For instructions on adding 
the server to a computer account, see the computer accounts chapter of the user 
management guide. Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for the Open 
Directory master server in the Computers & Services list.
3 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click General (near the top).
4 Confirm that the Role is Open Directory Master, then click Add Kerberos Record and 
enter the requested information.

Administrator Name:  Enter the name of an LDAP directory administrator on the Open 
Directory master server.
Administrator Password:  Enter the password of the administrator account you 
entered.
Configuration Record Name:  Enter the computer record name of the server for which 
you are delegating authority to join Kerberos. The server’s computer record name is the 
same as the server’s name in a computer account.
Delegated Administrators:  Enter a short name or a long name for each user account 
to which you want to delegate authority. Separate multiple names by pressing Return 
after each name.
Joining a Server to an Open Directory Master for Single Signon 
and Kerberos
Using Server Admin, a server administrator whose user account has the properly 
delegated authority can join a server to an Open Directory master for single signon and 
Kerberos authentication. This authority must be delegated in advance by an 
administrator of the Open Directory master.
To join a server to an Open Directory master for single signon and Kerberos:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for the target server in the Computers & 
Services list.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click General (near the top).
3 Confirm that the Role is Connected to a Directory System, then click Join Kerberos and 
enter the name and password of a user account that has been delegated authority for 
the target server.
Setting LDAP Options
You can set several options for LDAP directories of an Open Directory master or replica. 
See the following:
• “Setting the Replication Frequency of an Open Directory Master” (next)
• “Changing the Location of an LDAP Database” on page 64
• “Limiting Search Results for LDAP Service” on page 65
• “Changing the Search Timeout for LDAP Service” on page 65

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
Setting the Replication Frequency of an Open Directory Master
Using Server Admin, you can specify how frequently an Open Directory master will 
update its replicas with changes to directory and authentication information. The 
master can update the replicas whenever a change occurs in the master directory 
domain or on a schedule you specify.
To specify how frequently an Open Directory master updates its replicas:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for an Open Directory master server in 
the Computers & Services list.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click General (near the top).
3 Specify a replication frequency.
“Replicate to clients whenever the directory is modified”:  Keeps replicas accurate, 
but increases network load. May impair the performance of the master if a replica is 
connected via a slow network link.
“Replicate to clients every __”:  Allows you to schedule less frequent updates (by 
specifying a longer interval). Less frequent updates trades less accuracy of replicas for 
fewer network connections between the master and its replicas. Fewer network 
connections may be desirable if replicas are not all on the same LAN as the master.
4 Click Save.
Changing the Location of an LDAP Database
Using Server Admin, you can specify the disk location of the database that stores the 
user records and other information in an LDAP directory domain of an Open Directory 
master or replica. The LDAP database is usually located on the startup volume, but can 
be on a different local volume.
Note:  For security purposes, databases that store authentication information for Open 
Directory and Kerberos are always located on the startup volume regardless of the 
LDAP database location.
To change the location of a shared LDAP database:
1 Open Server Admin and in the Computers & Services list, select Open Directory for a 
server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Protocols (near the top).
3 Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu, then specify the folder path 
where you want the LDAP database to be located.
4 Click Save.

Limiting Search Results for LDAP Service
Using Server Admin, you can prevent one type of denial-of-service attack on Mac OS X 
Server by limiting the number of search results returned by the server’s shared LDAP 
directory domain. Limiting the number of search results prevents a malicious user from 
tying up the server by sending it multiple all-inclusive LDAP search requests.
To set a maximum number of LDAP search results:
1 Open Server Admin and in the Computers & Services list, select Open Directory for a 
server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Protocols (near the top).
3 Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu, then enter the maximum 
number of search results.
4 Click Save.
Changing the Search Timeout for LDAP Service
Using Server Admin, you can prevent one type of denial-of-service attack on Mac OS X 
Server by limiting the amount of time the server will spend on one search of its shared 
LDAP directory domain. Setting a search timeout prevents a malicious user from tying 
up the server by sending it an exceptionally complex LDAP search request.
To set a timeout interval for LDAP searches:
1 Open Server Admin and in the Computers & Services list, select Open Directory for a 
server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Protocols (near the top).
3 Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu, then specify a search timeout 
interval.
4 Click Save.
Setting up SSL for LDAP Service
Using Server Admin, you can set up encrypted communications between a shared 
LDAP directory domain on Mac OS X Server and other servers that connect to the 
directory domain. You can enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for encrypted LDAP 
communications and specify the location of the SSL certificate file, key file, and 
certificate authority (CA) certificate file.
SSL communications for LDAP use port 636. If SSL is disabled for LDAP service, 
communications are sent as clear text on port 389.
LL2352.Book  Page 65  Friday, August 22, 2003  3:12 PM

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
To set up SSL communications for LDAP service:
1 Open Server Admin and in the Computers & Services list, select Open Directory for a 
server that is an Open Directory master or an Open Directory replica.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Protocols (near the top).
3 Choose LDAP Settings from the Configure pop-up menu, then select Use SSL.
4 Enter the location and name for the SSL Certificate, SSL Key, and CA Certificate. 
Instead of typing or pasting the location and name of the SSL Certificate, SSL Key, or CA 
Certificate, you can locate it by clicking the Browse button next to the field.
5 Click Save.
Migrating a Directory Domain From Netinfo to LDAP
You can use Server Admin to migrate a shared NetInfo directory domain to LDAP. The 
migration process irreversibly replaces the directory domain’s NetInfo back-end 
database with a Berkeley DB back-end database. After migration, client computers that 
were configured to use NetInfo to access the directory domain will be able to continue 
accessing it. 
After migration, you can configure DHCP service to provide the migrated directory 
domain as an LDAP server to client computers with Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server 
version 10.2 and later that have automatic authentication search policies. 
You can have client computers with Mac OS X version 10.3 or Mac OS X Server version 
10.3 automatically switch to using LDAP to access the migrated directory domain. The 
migration process can store auto-switch information in the directory domain. When 
Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server version 10.3 and later use NetInfo to access a directory 
domain that has been migrated to LDAP, they pick up the auto-switch information from 
the directory domain and reconfigure themselves to access the directory domain using 
LDAP henceforth.
When you set up migration, you can specify a date on which NetInfo access to the 
migrated directory domain will be disabled. Alternatively, you can disable NetInfo 
access at any time by clicking a button. After NetInfo is disabled, client computers can’t 
switch automatically to LDAP. 
The migration process moves all standard record types and data types from the NetInfo 
database to an LDAP database. If the NetInfo directory domain was modified to contain 
custom record types or data types, they are not moved to the LDAP database.
LL2352.Book  Page 66  Friday, August 22, 2003  3:12 PM
Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
67
Migration to LDAP does not change how user passwords are validated except for 
passwords validated by Authentication Manager. Passwords that were validated by a 
Password Server continue to be validated by the same Password Server. If any user 
accounts in the NetInfo domain used Authentication Manager for password validation, 
the migration process converts them to have a password type of Open Directory. Of 
course, an administrator can change the password type of any migrated user account 
to Open Directory so that the user account can take advantage of single signon and 
Kerberos authentication.
Important:  Do not click the Disable NetInfo button by accident. Clicking Disable 
NetInfo immediately disables NetInfo access to the directory domain. You can’t undo 
this change. After disabling NetInfo, all computers that need to connect to the 
directory domain must be configured to do so using LDAP.
To migrate a server’s shared directory domain from NetInfo to LDAP:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for an Open Directory master server in 
the Computers & Services list.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Protocols (near the top).
3 Choose NetInfo Migration from the Configure pop-up menu.
4 Click Migrate and set the migration options.
Administrator short name:  The short name of an administrator account in the server’s 
local directory domain that you want to have copied to the migrated LDAP directory. 
This account will be an administrator of the LDAP directory domain.
Administrator password:  The password for the administrator account whose short 
name you entered.
Kerberos realm name:  By convention, the Kerberos realm name is the same as the 
server’s DNS name but in all uppercase letters. For example, a server whose DNS name 
is example.com would have a Kerberos realm name of EXAMPLE.COM.
Search base (optional):  The search base suffix for the migrated LDAP directory. 
Typically, the search base suffix is derived from the server’s DNS name. For example, the 
search base suffix could be “dc=example, dc=com” for a server whose DNS name is 
server.example.com.
Switch existing NetInfo clients to LDAP:  Enables client computers with Mac OS X or 
Mac OS X Server version 10.3 to automatically reconfigure themselves to access the 
migrated directory domain using LDAP instead of NetInfo. 
Shut down NetInfo Server at 2:00 am on __:  Enter a date when you want to end 
NetInfo access to the migrated directory domain. After NetInfo is disabled, all 
computers must use LDAP to access the migrated directory domain.
5 Click OK to begin migration.
The migration process can take a while.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
6 After migration finishes, set up DHCP service to provide the LDAP server’s address to 
client computers with automatic search policies.
Computers with Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server version 10.2 can have automatic search 
policies. These computers don’t have to be configured individually to access the LDAP 
server. When these computers start up, they try to get an LDAP server’s address from 
DHCP service.
For instructions on setting up DHCP service to supply an LDAP server’s address, see the 
network services administration guide.
Switching Directory Access From NetInfo to LDAP
After you migrate a shared directory domain of Mac OS X Server from NetInfo to LDAP, 
some clients will switch to LDAP automatically, but you may have to configure other 
clients to use LDAP and you may have to reconfigure DHCP service.
• Computers with an automatic authentication search policy get the address of their 
directory server from DHCP service. Therefore, you need to change DHCP service to 
supply the address of the migrated LDAP directory’s server.
• Computers with Mac OS X Server version 10.3 that were using NetInfo to access the 
migrated directory domain can switch to LDAP automatically. Automatic switching 
must be enabled when the directory domain is migrated from NetInfo to LDAP. 
Mac OS X can no longer switch automatically to LDAP after you disable NetInfo on 
the migrated directory domain’s server.
• You can manually switch a Mac OS X computer to LDAP by using Directory Access. 
• You can configure the computer to use an automatic authentication search policy. 
In this case, you also need to configure DHCP service to supply the migrated LDAP 
directory server’s address to its clients. 
• Alternatively, you can set up an LDAPv3 configuration on the computer and add 
this LDAPv3 configuration to the computer’s custom authentication search policy.
• After you disable NetInfo on the server, make sure DHCP is not supplying the server’s 
address for NetInfo binding.
For more information, see “Migrating a Directory Domain From Netinfo to LDAP” on 
page 66, “Setting Up the Authentication and Contacts Search Policies” on page 87, and 
“Accessing LDAP Directories” on page 90, and the DHCP chapter in the network 
services administration guide.

Disabling NetInfo After Migrating to LDAP
If none of the client computers on your network needs NetInfo access to a directory 
domain that has been migrated to LDAP, you can use Server Admin to disable NetInfo. 
You can manually disable the NetInfo server even if you scheduled a shutdown of the 
NetInfo server while setting up the migration to LDAP.
Important:  Do not disable NetInfo prematurely. After disabling NetInfo, all computers 
that need to connect to the directory domain must be configured to do so using LDAP.
To disable NetInfo access to a directory domain that has been migrated to 
LDAP:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for an Open Directory master server in 
the Computers & Services list.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click Protocols (near the top).
3 Choose NetInfo Migration from the Configure pop-up menu.
4 Click Disable NetInfo. 
Clicking Disable NetInfo immediately disables NetInfo access to the directory domain. 
You can’t undo this change.

6 Managing User Authentication
The authentication services included with Mac OS X 
Server don’t require any setup, but you can change how 
each user is authenticated.
Mac OS X Server can authenticate users by:
• Using single signon with the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) built into 
Mac OS X Server
• Using a password stored securely in the Open Directory Password Server database
• Using a shadow password stored as several hashes, including NT and LAN Manager, 
in a file that only the root user can access
• Using a crypt password stored directly in the user’s account
• Using a non-Apple LDAP server for simple LDAP bind authentication
Single signon and Kerberos authentication require minimal setup of Mac OS X Server. 
The other authentication options require no setup of Mac OS X Server. 
You can manage how Mac OS X Server uses the available options to authenticate users. 
For task descriptions and instructions, see:
• “Composing a Password” on page 72
• “Changing a User’s Password” on page 72
• “Resetting the Passwords of Multiple Users” on page 73
• “Changing the Global Password Policy” on page 74
• “Setting Password Policies for Individual Users” on page 75
• “Changing a User’s Password Type” on page 76
This includes changing the password type to Open Directory, shadow password, or 
crypt password; and enabling single signon, Kerberos, or LDAP bind authentication.

Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
Composing a Password
The password associated with a user’s account must be entered by the user when he or 
she authenticates for login or some other service. The password is case sensitive 
(except for SMB LAN Manager passwords) and is masked on the screen as it is entered. 
Regardless of the password type you choose for any user, here are some guidelines for 
composing a password for Mac OS X Server users:
• A password should contain letters, numbers, and symbols in combinations that won’t 
be easily guessed by unauthorized users. Passwords should not consist of actual 
words. Good passwords might include digits and symbols (such as # or $). Or they 
might consist of the first letter of all the words in a particular phrase. Use both 
uppercase and lowercase letters.
• Avoid spaces and Option-key combinations. 
• Avoid characters that can’t be entered on computers the user will be using or that 
might require knowing a special keystroke combination to enter correctly on 
different keyboards and platforms. 
• Some network protocols do not support passwords that contain leading spaces, 
embedded spaces, or trailing spaces. 
• A zero-length password is not recommended; Open Directory and some systems 
(such as LDAP bind) do not support a zero-length password.
For maximum compatibility with computers and services your users might use, use 
only ASCII characters in passwords.
Changing a User’s Password
You can use Workgroup Manager to change a user’s password. 
To change a user’s password:
1 In Workgroup Manager, click the Accounts button, then click the User button.
2 Open the directory domain that contains the user account whose password you want 
to change, and authenticate as an administrator of the domain.
To open a directory domain, click the small globe icon above the list of users and 
choose from the pop-up menu.
If the user’s password type is Open Directory, you must authenticate as an 
administrator whose password type is Open Directory.
3 Select the account whose password needs to be changed. 
4 Enter a password on the Basic pane, then click Save.
5 Tell the user the new password so he or she can log in.
After the user logs in to Mac OS X with the new password, the user can change the 
password by clicking Accounts in System Preferences.
LL2352.Book  Page 72  Friday, August 22, 2003  3:12 PM
Chapter 6    Managing User Authentication
73
If you change the password of an account whose password type is Open Directory and 
the account resides in the LDAP directory of an Open Directory replica or master, the 
change will eventually be synchronized with the master and all its replicas. Mac OS X 
Server automatically synchronizes changes to Open Directory passwords among a 
master and its replicas.
Resetting the Passwords of Multiple Users
You can use Workgroup Manager to simultaneously select multiple user accounts and 
change them all to have the same password type and the same temporary password. 
To change the password type and password of multiple user accounts:
1 In Workgroup Manager, click the Accounts button, then click the User button.
2 Open the directory domain that contains the user account whose password types and
