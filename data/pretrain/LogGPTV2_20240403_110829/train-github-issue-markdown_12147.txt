I plan to move to using AWS S3 SDK instead of using JetS3T. I have noticed the
following problems with JetS3T:
  1. AWS SDK has better support for auth (reading credentials files etc)
  2. It is far behind AWS S3 SDK in terms of development-release/support.
What do you think @gianm @leventov @cheddar ?
