It would be convenient to have more iterable unpacking.
Julia 1.7:
    julia> x, (ys...) = (1,2,3,4);
    julia> x, ys
    (1, (2, 3, 4))
    julia> x, (ys...), z = (1,2,3,4)
    ERROR: syntax: invalid "..." on non-final assignment location "ys" around REPL[2]:1
Python (feature specification):
    In [1]: x, *y, z = [1,2,3,4]
    In [2]: x, y, z
    Out[2]: (1, [2, 3], 4)
