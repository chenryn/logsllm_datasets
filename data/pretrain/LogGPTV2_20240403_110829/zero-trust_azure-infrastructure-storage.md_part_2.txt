You configure access control from the **Access Control (IAM)** settings of a storage account, as shown here.

You can check the access levels of users, groups, service principals, or managed identities and add a role assignment.
Another way to provide permissions that are time-bound is through Shared Access Signatures (SAS). [Best Practices when using SAS](/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#best-practices-when-using-sas) at a high level are the following:
- Always use HTTPS. If you have deployed the [suggested Azure Policies for Azure landing zones](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/ALZ-Policies), secure transfer via HTTPS will be audited.
- Have a revocation plan.
- Configure SAS expiration policies.
- Validate permissions.
- Use a user delegation SAS wherever possible. This SAS is signed with Microsoft Entra credentials.
## Step 3: Logically separate or segregate critical data with network controls
In this step, you use the recommended controls to protect the network connections to and from Azure Storage services.
The following diagram highlights the network connections to the Azure Storage services in the reference architecture.

|Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Prevent public access, create network segmentation with [Private Endpoint](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) and Private Link. | Private endpoint allows you to connect to services with the use of a single private IP address on the VNet using Azure Private Link.  Enabling private endpoints allows the Azure platform to validate network connections and allow only the connection with explicit access to the private-link resource to gain access to subsequent resources.  You'll need a separate private endpoint for each service on the Azure Storage Account.
| Use [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) | Use Azure Private Link to access Azure Storage over a private endpoint in your VNet. Use the [approval workflow](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) to automatically approve or manually request, as appropriate. |
| Prevent public access to your data sources using [Service Endpoints](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) | You can do network segmentation using Service Endpoints by enabling private IP addresses in a VNet to reach an endpoint without using public IP addresses. |
You configure private endpoints from the **Networking** settings of a storage account, as shown here.

## Step 4: Use Defender for Storage for automated threat detection and protection
[Microsoft Defender for Storage](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure?tabs=azure-security-center) provides that additional level of intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to exploit your storage services. Microsoft Defender for Storage is built into Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Defender for Storage detects anomalous access pattern alerts such as:
- Access from unusual locations
- Application Anomaly
- Anonymous access
- Anomalous extract/upload alerts
- Data Exfiltration
- Unexpected delete
- Upload Azure Cloud Service package
- Suspicious storage activities alerts
- Access permission change
- Access Inspection
- Data Exploration
For more information about threat protection across the reference architecture, see the [Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure IaaS overview](azure-infrastructure-overview.md).
Once enabled, Defender for Storage notifies you of security alerts and recommendations for improving the security posture of your Azure storage accounts.
Here's an example security alert for a storage account with a description of the alert and prevention measures highlighted.
