(cid:11)i of the equally partitioning mechanism, o.w.
By doing so, the resulting intervals are guaranteed to achieve
equal or stronger privacy while avoiding unique identi(cid:12)ca-
tion than the intervals generated by the equally partitioning
mechanism.
The resulting optimal partitions are presented in Figs. 8b,
8d, and 8f. The utility and (cid:11)i of the optimal interval are pre-
sented in the caption, too. According to the value of (cid:11)i and
utility, it is apparent that the optimal partitioning mecha-
nism achieves stronger privacy and provides better utility
simultaneously. Vertical lines show the intervals generated
by the mechanism. The optimal interval mechanism appar-
ently provides narrower (that is, more exact) outputs than
the equally partitioning mechanism.
Regarding the interval of the equally partitioning mecha-
nism, the leftmost (resp. rightmost) interval includes points
with x2 = 1 (resp. points x2 = 0) only. Therefore, x2
can be identi(cid:12)ed uniquely by the mechanism outputs. For
all results of the optimal interval mechanism, it is apparent
that all intervals include both points. Consequently, the ad-
versary cannot uniquely identify any input attribute by the
mechanism outputs.
To conclude, the optimal interval mechanism has bet-
ter performance than the equally partitioning mechanism
in terms of privacy and utility. In addition, the optimal in-
terval mechanism can speci(cid:12)cally control (cid:11)i for each input
540mechanism with the disease susceptibility models. Our mech-
anism guarantees ~(cid:11)-obscure privacy while the Laplace mech-
anism guarantees ϵ-diﬀerential privacy. Since the privacy
de(cid:12)nitions are not the same, the outputs are not directly
comparable. Instead, we compare the utility of two mech-
anisms. Given ~(cid:11) and inputs, our mechanism outputs inter-
vals. For the intervals, we evaluate the probability that the
diﬀerentially private mechanism returns output within the
intervals for various ϵ. If the probability is high, the out-
put distribution of the diﬀerentially private mechanism is
close to the interval of our mechanism. In contrast, if the
probability is low, the output of the diﬀerentially private
mechanism distributes broadly outside of the interval. We
call this probability inclusion probability.
First, we introduce a diﬀerential privacy mechanism for
