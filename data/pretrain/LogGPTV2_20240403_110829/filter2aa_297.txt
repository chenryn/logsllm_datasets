### User Privacy for ISPs and Accidental ISPs

#### Introduction
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) grants significant power to those claiming copyright ownership, allowing them to intrude on the privacy of Internet users. With minimal formalities, almost anyone can demand that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) disclose its users' personal information, provided the ISP has that data. If served with a subpoena, as demonstrated in the RIAA v. Verizon case, ISPs are legally compelled to respond, leaving user data vulnerable to various parties, including record companies, private investigators, spammers, and others who may seek users' names and addresses.

#### Protecting User Privacy
To best protect your users' privacy, whether you are a large ISP or a dorm-room system administrator, it is advisable not to retain logs containing personal information or linking users to their online activities. You cannot be forced to disclose information you do not possess.

If you provide network connectivity without being a commercial ISP—such as offering wired or wireless access in libraries, cafes, or residences—you may still be targeted by information demands. As a non-commercial ISP, there is often no compelling reason to keep such information. In fact, becoming an "accidental ISP" can enhance the privacy of people using your network. Simple changes in record-keeping and user connection methods can help limit legal complications.

#### Network Management for Privacy
Computers on a network are uniquely identified by their IP addresses. To protect privacy, network administrators can assign IP addresses dynamically from a pool, rotating them randomly among users, and then promptly delete assignment logs. EFF is not aware of any laws requiring ISPs to maintain records tying specific IP addresses to user identities.

#### Privacy-Enhancing Network Management
Many networking tools, such as DHCP servers and web servers, can be configured to capture varying amounts of user information. Configure these tools to log only the essential data for troubleshooting and network security, and regularly purge unnecessary logs.

**Example:**
- **RIAA v. Verizon Case**: The recording industry forced Verizon to disclose the names and addresses of subscribers accused of file sharing via KaZaA. EFF and 44 other consumer privacy groups and ISPs filed a brief to protest the broad privacy implications. The law does not scrutinize the basis of the copyright complaint before demanding compliance, relying instead on the requester's "good faith," making it susceptible to abuse by stalkers, identity thieves, and criminals. An IP address, which can be obtained from emails, instant messages, or file-sharing networks, is all that is needed to initiate such a request.

**IP Addresses:**
- Internet Protocol (IP) addresses can be private to a local-area network (often gated to the Internet via NAT) or routable on the Internet. DHCP can be used with either type of address.

**Data Management:**
- Even though hard drives are inexpensive, there are hidden costs to storing user data, such as the expense of protecting that information from legal attackers who use flawed laws to undermine privacy. Think carefully before capturing and storing data.
- Regularly purge data logs and backups you no longer need using strong deletion utilities. Overwrite free space and swap files to avoid inadvertently retaining data.
- Scrub the logs you do need to remove extraneous information, particularly personally identifiable information. For example, if you need to know the country of origin of your users, resolve IP addresses to national origins and then delete the IPs.

**Network Configuration:**
- Assign dynamic IP addresses and do not keep logs of past assignments. Once a DHCP lease ends, flush it from the logs.
- Reduce DHCP lease times.
- If you authenticate users by MAC addresses, do not keep records of which users use which MAC addresses.
- If you connect dial-up users, do not log the caller ID and user ID to IP address pairings.

#### Becoming an "Accidental ISP"
Inexpensive networking equipment is making more people into network administrators. For example, a college dorm resident can set up an open Wi-Fi router for less than $100, providing wireless network access to an entire floor. Properly configured software on the wireless router can make it difficult to ascertain the identities of individual users. If your service provider's terms permit, consider setting up such a network.

**Note on Data Deletion:**
- Simply deleting data from a hard drive or even writing over it does not remove all traces. Undelete utilities and forensic analysis can often recover weakly deleted data. Strong deletion utilities (also known as secure deletion utilities) overwrite the old data multiple times to clear these remnants.
