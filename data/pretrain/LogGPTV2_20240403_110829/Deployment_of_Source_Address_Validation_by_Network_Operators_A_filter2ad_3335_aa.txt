Abstract—IP spooﬁng, sending IP packets with a false source
IP address, continues to be a primary attack vector for large-
scale Denial of Service attacks. To combat spooﬁng, various
interventions have been tried to increase the adoption of source
address validation (SAV) among network operators. How can
SAV deployment be increased? In this work, we conduct the ﬁrst
randomized control trial to measure the effectiveness of various
notiﬁcation mechanisms on SAV deployment.
We include new treatments using nudges and channels, pre-
viously untested in notiﬁcation experiments. Our design reveals
a painful reality that contrasts with earlier observational stud-
ies: none of the notiﬁcation treatments signiﬁcantly improved
SAV deployment compared to the control group. We explore
the reasons for these ﬁndings and report on a survey among
operators to identify ways forward. A portion of the operators
indicate that they do plan to deploy SAV and ask for better
notiﬁcation mechanisms, training, and support materials for SAV
implementation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remain a
signiﬁcant challenge for network operators. In a 2019 survey
by RIPE NCC of more than 4,000 participants, operators
identiﬁed DDoS as the most critical security problem [1].
Attacks keep increasing in size. In February 2020, Amazon
web services received the largest DDoS attack observed to
date, which peaked at approximately 2.3 Tbps and lasted three
days [2]. IP spooﬁng—sending Internet Protocol (IP) packets
with a false source IP address—continues to serve as a primary
attack vector for large-scale DDoS attacks [3]. It is used in
ampliﬁcation attacks, where an attacker forges the victim’s
IP address in requests sent to systems that act as ampliﬁers,
such as DNS or Memcached servers. These systems reply with
larger responses than the request sent by the attacker, thereby
congesting victim’s network or server. IP spooﬁng is also used
in SYN ﬂood attacks, to obscure the origin of the attack trafﬁc.
The scourge of IP spooﬁng has Internet Hall of Fame
technologist Paul Vixie [4] to observe: ‘Nowhere in the basic
architecture of the Internet
is there a more hideous ﬂaw
than in the lack of enforcement of simple source-address
validation (SAV) by most gateways.’ Over the last decade, a
movement of sorts has emerged around a manifesto on routing
security [5]. It aims to remediate this problem by encouraging
network operators to adopt a best current practice referred
to as BCP38 [6]. BCP38—also more generally referred to
as SAV—deﬁnes a method for routers to validate the source
address of every outgoing packet. A router should drop packets
if the source address is not valid for the attachment point.
Around 25-32% of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) tested
by volunteers of the Spoofer project are reported to have
problematic or wholly lacking SAV adoption [7].
This brings us to our main question: How can more
operators be moved to adopt SAV? Earlier work on other
security issues found that operators do act on notiﬁcations
that report vulnerabilities or abuse in their networks, albeit to
varying degrees [8]–[11]. Speciﬁcally for SAV, researchers at
the Spoofer project recently reported that notifying operators
boosted remediation rates by about 50% [7]. Their ﬁndings
were based only on observational data. The authors argued that
“ideally” one would undertake A/B testing to more reliably
measure the effect of various interventions on remediation.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst randomized control trial
(RCT, also called ‘A/B test’) for measuring the impact of noti-
ﬁcations sent to 2,320 network operators on SAV remediation
rates. This population is much larger than in any prior study
on SAV. It is possible because we use misconﬁgured open
resolvers as vantage points [12], [13]—a different technique
to observe the lack of SAV adoption than the volunteer-based
Spoofer project [14]. We include a control group in the design,
which no earlier study on SAV did and which yields a crucial
insight that puts the earlier ﬁndings in a different light: the
improvements that [7] observed might be incorrectly attributed
to the interventions.
Our study is novel in other aspects as well. We contribute
to the research on notiﬁcation mechanisms by conducting
the ﬁrst test of social and reciprocity nudges in the mes-
sage design. In terms of channels, we test private messages
to operators versus notifying national CERTs versus using
geographically-organized Network Operator Group (NOG)
mailing lists. Sending notiﬁcations to a public forum (NOG)
has not before been tested in an experiment. Finally, we
partnered with NIC.br, a leading Brazilian CERT, to have
them deliver the treatment ﬁrst-hand. CERTs are a trusted
partner in the operator community and a critical player in the
security notiﬁcation ecosystem, yet it has not been measured if
their notiﬁcations have more impact than those of researchers
or security companies. We complement our experiment by a
survey among operators, to help us interpret the ﬁndings and
identify ways forward. In short: we conduct the largest and

most rigorous study on improving SAV adoption to date, as
well as advance the knowledge on notiﬁcation mechanisms.
Our study reveals a painful and disappointing reality: there
is no evidence of any remediation driven by any of the
treatments, compared to the control group. This includes
treatments that prior work has thought to be effective. Even for
the notiﬁcations from the Brazilian CERT, the trusted entity,
we found no effect compared to the control group. Importantly,
we did observe some remediation across all groups, including
the control group. It might explain why [7] did report an
impact of their notiﬁcations. Since they had no control group,
they could not see that the remediation they measured was not
actually driven by the intervention. All in all, our ﬁndings are
sobering but important, if we are to correct our understanding
of these interventions and move forward on this critical issue.
Our survey among operators helps us identify how. In sum,
we make the following contributions:
• We present the ﬁrst rigorous notiﬁcation experiment with
a control group that focused on network operators as
the primary population to be incentivized to adopt more
secure practices.
• We perform the ﬁrst large-scale notiﬁcation experiment
to measure the impact of social and reciprocity nudges
in the notiﬁcation messages, the use of a public forum
(NOG mailing lists), and a national CERT sending out
the notiﬁcations. None of the treatments performed better
than the control.
• We use a Cox mixed-effects model [15] to quantify
the impact of network complexity factors and socio-
technical country level effects on the deployment of SAV.
Our results show that smaller networks with fewer edge
routers are likely to implement SAV faster than larger
networks.
• Our survey conﬁrmed that notifying contacts registered
in WHOIS does, in fact, mostly reach the operator staff
responsible for implementing SAV. The reasons they
give for not
implementing it are a lack of time and
technical expertise. About half of respondents do indicate
that
they plan to implement SAV in the future. To
improve SAV adoption, the operators recommend better
notiﬁcation systems, training on SAV implementation and
better supporting resources like software and technical
documentation.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section we review the existing methods to infer the
adoption of SAV among network operators, prior experiments
that
tested the effectiveness of security notiﬁcations, and
literature on nudging.
A. Methods to Infer the Adoption of SAV
Previous work [7], [14], [16]–[23] have proposed methods
to detect networks that do or do not implement the SAV
standard. They differ with respect to the direction of ﬁltering,
whether they infer the presence or absence of SAV, and
whether the measurements can be performed remotely or from
inside the network under test.
The Spoofer project [7], [14], [20], [21] develops and
supports a client-server system based on volunteers that run
the client software from inside their networks. The client
periodically sends and receives packets with spoofed source
IP addresses to test if the SAV is deployed for both inbound
and outbound trafﬁc.
Lone et al. [23] described a remote method that relies
on traceroute loops. When a packet is sent to a destination
network with a routable but unallocated IP address space, it
is forwarded back to the provider router, thus resulting in a
loop. Such a packet should be dropped by the provider router
as the source IP does not belong to the customer network. The
main limitation is that it relies on a routing misconﬁguration,
and therefore coverage of the method is relatively small.
M¨uller et al. [16] and Lichtblau et al. [17] passively
analyzed inter-domain trafﬁc at large inter-connection points
(IXPs) to detect networks not deploying SAV. However, the
proposed methods need to overcome several challenges to
be effective, such as analyzing noisy BGP data sources, AS
relationship inference, and require collaboration with IXPs.
To detect the lack of SAV for outbound trafﬁc, we imple-
ment a different method that does not require volunteers for
vantage points inside the tested network and that enabled us
to include a larger sample of operators in our study than prior
work.
B. Security Notiﬁcation Experiments
There has been a rich stream of studies on the effectiveness
of notiﬁcations to operators of networks, websites and DNS
infrastructure. Cetin et al. [24] described how ISPs notiﬁed
and quarantined customers who were running devices that
were vulnerable to being abused in ampliﬁcation DDoS at-
tacks. They reported the quarantined users achieved very high
remediation rates, around 87%, even though these devices did
not pose a risk to the users themselves and the users could
easily exit the quarantine.
In another study, K¨uhrer et al. [22] sent notiﬁcations to the
network operators about open resolvers, which provide am-
pliﬁcation and redirection for DDoS attacks in their network.
They were able to remediate 92% of the open NTP servers
which supported monlist. They used various intermedi-
aries, including national CERTs, Network Operation Centers
(NOCs), and notiﬁcations using the open NTP project. They,
however, did not compare the effectiveness of these channels.
Luckie et al. notiﬁed network operators who had not imple-
mented SAV in their networks [7]. They initially contacted
them directly using email addresses listed in the WHOIS.
Subsequently, they sent monthly emails to NOGs identifying
ASes in a given region with apparent gaps in SAV deployment.
They observed around 48.2% of remediation took at least
1 month to deploy. Furthermore, they reported NOG was twice
as effective as private notiﬁcations.
Our work comes closest to the study by Luckie et al. [7],
since we also notify network operators who have not imple-

mented SAV in their networks. However, their analysis of the
impact of their interventions was based on observational data,
not a randomized control trial. The lack of randomization and
a control group makes causal inferences about the impact of
notiﬁcation on SAV deployment less reliable. Moreover, we
also tested the signiﬁcance of interventions using nudges and
the impact of sending notiﬁcations through national CERTs on
remediations. Another difference is that our study is based on a
much larger sample [12], [13]. Our technique to detect SAV via
open resolvers has two advantages over Spoofer data [7]: we
