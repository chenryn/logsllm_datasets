User: How to configure SSH and establish SSH connection under Linux?
Assistant: 1. Install and enable the SSH service On Linux, the SSH service is usually provided in the OpenSSH software package. OpenSSH can be installed in a terminal with the following command: ``` sudo apt-get install openssh-server ``` Once installed, you can ensure that the SSH service is running with the following command: ``` sudo service ssh status ``` If the service If it is not running, you can use the following command to start the service: ``` sudo service ssh start ``` 2. Connect to a Linux computer via SSH To use SSH to connect to a remote Linux computer, you need to know the IP address of the remote computer and the SSH port number. You can then connect to the remote computer with the following command: ``` ssh username@remote_host_ip_address -p remote_host_ssh_port ``` where 'username' is the username on the remote computer, 'remote_host_ip_address' is the IP address of the remote computer, and 'remote_host_ssh_port' is the SSH port number of the remote computer. For example, if you want to connect to a remote computer with IP address 192.168.0.10 and port number 2222, and use "bob" as the username, you can execute the following command: ``` ssh bob@192.168.0.10 -p 2222 ``` The remote computer's SSH public key needs to be authenticated when connecting for the first time. If confirming the SSH public key of the remote computer, type "yes" to confirm. Once authenticated, you will be prompted for the remote computer's password. If the remote computer uses SSH keys for authentication, you can avoid entering a password by adding the SSH key file path to the ssh command. For example, if the key file is located at ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you can use the following command to connect to the remote machine: ``` ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa bob@192.168.0.10 -p 2222 ``` These are in Basic steps to configure SSH and establish an SSH connection under Linux. Advanced users can also improve security by configuring security options for the SSH client and server, and configure SSH access for different users and hosts.
