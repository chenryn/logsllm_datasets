**Abstract:**
Organizations today face significant challenges in following and implementing their business process models. These challenges arise from two primary issues: inadequate planning and requirements analysis, leading to unfeasible or difficult-to-execute process models, and the neglect of different stakeholder perspectives during the design phase, resulting in models that do not meet stakeholders' needs. This paper addresses these problems and proposes a business process knowledge framework as a potential solution. Our framework integrates three key elements—stakeholders' perspectives, knowledge types, and views—to improve the process knowledge acquisition and communication phases. We also argue that recent advancements in the Semantic Web can support the integration of information and knowledge within our proposed framework.

### 1. Introduction

The importance of business processes as a critical asset for organizational success and development is increasingly recognized. A recent survey (BPM Study, 2006) indicates that almost 80% of companies are deeply committed to business process management (BPM). The main reasons for this commitment include increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving process effectiveness and innovation, compliance management, and IT system development and introduction.

Despite the growing adoption of BPM, there remains a significant gap between theory and practice. Organizational practices and market analysis reports (Strohmaier et al., 2005) highlight various difficulties in this area. In this paper, we propose a solution to two identified problems:
1. **Inadequate Process Analysis:** The way process models are built often lacks thoroughness.
2. **Poor Process Description Communication:** The scope, abstraction level, and language used in communicating process models to stakeholders are often inappropriate.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 defines business process knowledge, its perspectives, types, views, and key stakeholders. Section 3 introduces our business process knowledge framework. Section 4 demonstrates the application of the framework in supporting process knowledge acquisition and communication. Finally, in Section 5, we suggest a Semantic Web-based approach to implement our theoretical model.

### 2. Business Process and Process Improvement Knowledge

#### 2.1. Process Knowledge Sources

Process knowledge is distributed among various stakeholders, including employees, external partners, customers, and suppliers. This knowledge varies in scope and abstraction. For example, some employees may be familiar with specific activities, while quality managers have an overview of entire processes. Documented sources such as organization manuals, quality system documentation, lessons learned, and best practices also contribute to process knowledge (Figure 2).

#### 2.2. Business Process Knowledge Types

Process models can be viewed from different perspectives, such as functional, behavioral, organizational, and informational (Curtis et al., 1992). These perspectives help in understanding the process elements, their relationships, execution, and the informational entities involved. For our framework, we classify business process knowledge into the following categories:
- **Process Logic:** Knowledge about process elements, their connections, operators, and conditions.
- **Process Information:** Knowledge about inputs, outputs, and resources needed for process execution.
- **Process Environment:** Knowledge about critical success factors, interference factors, and possible obstacles.
- **Process Capacity:** Quantitative statements about process capacity and the associated measurement system.
- **Process Justification:** Answers to questions about the purpose and arrangement of individual processes.

#### 2.3. Business Process Knowledge Perspectives

From a process management perspective, several roles can be differentiated based on their relevance to different types of knowledge: process owner, activity performer, process designer, superior decision maker, and internal/external customers. Each role provides a unique perspective on the process knowledge, contributing to a comprehensive view of the process (Zesar and Mesaric, 1999).

### 3. Proposal for Business Process Knowledge Framework

The business process knowledge framework (Figure 3) visualizes the dimensions of process knowledge introduced in the previous section. This framework supports the identification and acquisition of process knowledge by considering where certain types of knowledge are located or can be acquired. It also helps in identifying alternatives if the collected knowledge is insufficient.

For documented process knowledge, the different perspectives must be correctly interpreted. In practical scenarios, a specific view often stands out. For instance, a process manual should describe how it should be according to the organization, while workflow management system logs (van der Aalst and Weijters, 2004) provide insights into the current situation.

### 4. Process Knowledge Framework Application

#### 4.1. Knowledge Acquisition

The acquisition of business process knowledge is a complex and time-consuming task. Knowledge is distributed, varied, and often incomplete. The extended business process knowledge framework (Figure 4) aids in this process by considering multiple perspectives:
- **Current Condition ("As-Is"):** A subjective picture of the current condition from the viewpoint of each person.
- **Desired Condition ("To-Be"):** An understanding of how the process should be according to the organization.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Personal opinions on how the process could be improved.

By integrating these perspectives, the framework facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the process, thereby enhancing the knowledge acquisition and communication phases.

### 5. Semantic Web-Based Approach

Recent developments in the Semantic Web offer a promising solution for integrating and managing the diverse and distributed nature of business process knowledge. By leveraging semantic technologies, organizations can better represent, integrate, and utilize the information and knowledge within our proposed framework. This approach can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of business process management.

This paper aims to address the challenges in business process management by providing a structured and comprehensive framework for process knowledge acquisition and communication. By integrating stakeholders' perspectives, knowledge types, and views, and by leveraging semantic technologies, organizations can develop more feasible and effective business process models.
