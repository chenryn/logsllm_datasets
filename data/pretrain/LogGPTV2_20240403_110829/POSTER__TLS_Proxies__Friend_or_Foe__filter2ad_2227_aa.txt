### Abstract
The use of TLS proxies to intercept encrypted traffic is controversial, as the same mechanism can serve both benevolent and malicious purposes. While these proxies can protect against malware, they can also be used for identity theft or warrantless government surveillance. To understand the prevalence and uses of TLS proxies, we developed a measurement tool and deployed it via a Google AdWords campaign. Our study generated 2.9 million certificate tests and found that 1 in 250 TLS connections are proxied. Most of these proxies appear to be benevolent, but we identified over 1,000 instances where three malware products were using this technology nefariously. We also found numerous cases of negligent and duplicitous behavior, which degrade security for users without their knowledge.

## 1. Introduction
Secure communication over the Internet relies on authenticating the identity of a website to establish trust. Web browsers authenticate a site by validating a chain of trust from the site's certificate back to one of a set of trusted root certificates. These root certificates are typically bundled with the operating system or browser.

However, the use of TLS proxies, which act as man-in-the-middle (MitM) for TLS connections, is compromising this validation system. Companies often employ TLS proxies for benevolent reasons, such as protecting intellectual property and network security. Personal firewalls use similar techniques to protect users from malware and phishing attempts. Despite these positive uses, TLS proxies can also be exploited by malicious entities to steal private information or conduct unauthorized surveillance. The most concerning aspect is that users are often unaware that their encrypted traffic is being intercepted, as browsers still display a reassuring lock icon during such sessions. Essentially, TLS proxies can subvert the authentication guarantees that TLS was designed to provide.

Although TLS proxies undermine the security of TLS connections, little research has been done to characterize their prevalence and use. Huang et al. [4] measured the prevalence of TLS proxies using data from Facebook, finding that 0.20% of TLS connections are proxied, mostly by corporate Internet filters and personal antivirus software. A small number of connections were intercepted by malware.

Our research aims to better understand the current uses of TLS proxies through a large-scale measurement study. We developed a tool to automatically measure the presence of TLS proxies using the Flash runtime. This method requires no user action and runs silently whenever a user visits our website. Using this tool, we conducted a measurement study via a Google AdWords campaign, scanning TLS connections when our ad is served. Our study found 11,764 proxied connections out of 22.9 million total measurements (0.41% of all connections) spanning 142 countries. Most substitute certificates claim to be from benevolent TLS proxies, but we also found numerous instances of negligent and malicious behavior, affecting thousands of systems.

We developed our tool and conducted our measurement study independently and prior to Huangâ€™s publication [4]. Our methodology allows us to collect results without the cooperation of a major website and find proxies that may have whitelisted high-profile sites. Compared to Huang, we found that TLS proxies are twice as common, identified additional malware, and found evidence of spammers using TLS proxies. Additionally, we discovered that one parental filter weakens security for its users by making them vulnerable to MitM attacks.

## 2. Measurement Study
We developed a tool to measure the prevalence of TLS proxies using existing, widely-deployed technologies. The tool runs silently from the user's perspective, requiring no installation or interaction. This is a significant advantage over other methods that require client-side software installation [6, 5, 1, 3, 2], as it enables us to quickly deploy our tool and obtain millions of measurements within a week. The primary limiting factor is the amount of money we wish to spend on Google's ad network.

Our tool detects TLS proxies in three steps, illustrated in Figure 1. We leverage the widespread deployment and transparency of the Adobe Flash runtime. The Flash application sends a ClientHello message to a TLS-enabled server and records the ServerHello and Certificate messages received in response. The retrieved certificates are then forwarded to the web server, which compares the certificate received with the original sent and reports a mismatch as a TLS proxy.

To determine the prevalence and uses of TLS proxies, we conducted an advertising campaign using Google AdWords. We uploaded our tool as part of a Flash advertisement, so it runs automatically on any client that views our ad. Our advertising campaign ran from January 6, 2014, to January 30, 2014. During this period, we served 4.6 million ads and successfully completed 2.9 million measurements. In total, we spent $5,101.88. Along with the certificate, we recorded the IP address of the client tested and used it to query the MaxMind GeoLite database for geolocation information. Of the tests, 11,764 returned a different X.509 certificate than was served by our secure web server, indicating the presence of a TLS proxy.

The proxies identified by our campaign originated in 142 countries and from 8,589 distinct IP addresses. Due to the targeting algorithms used by Google AdWords, our tool's exposure to these countries is not uniformly distributed. Connections from the United States and Brazil account for 36% of all proxies. Some countries have significantly higher percentages of proxied connections than the average, including France (1.09%), Canada (0.87%), Belgium (0.81%), the United States (0.79%), and Romania (0.74%).

### 2.1 Analysis of Issuer Organization
We analyzed the contents of the Issuer Organization in the substitute certificates we collected. We used OpenSSL to decode the certificates and store them in a database for querying. We also manually inspected the contents. The top 20 issuer organizations are listed below:

| Rank | Issuer Organization | Connections |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1    | Bitdefender          |             |
| 2    | PSafe Tecnologia S.A.|             |
| 3    | Sendori Inc          |             |
| 4    | ESET spol. s r. o.   |             |
| 5    | Null                 |             |
| 6    | Kaspersky Lab ZAO    |             |
| 7    | Fortinet             |             |
| 8    | Kurupira.NET         |             |
| 9    | POSCO                |             |
| 10   | Qustodio             |             |
| 11   | WebMakerPlus Ltd     |             |
| 12   | Southern Company Services |         |
| 13   | NordNet              |             |
| 14   | Target Corporation   |             |

This analysis provides insights into the organizations behind the TLS proxies and their potential uses.
