This log chunk documents several failed login attempts from two distinct IP addresses, 185.190.58.151 and 103.99.0.122, targeting the SSH service on a system. The log entries are as follows:

1. **Failed Login Attempts for 'admin'**:
   - At 09:11:18, an invalid user 'admin' from 185.190.58.151 (port 44155) attempted to log in, resulting in a failed password.
   - At 09:11:20, another invalid user 'admin' from 103.99.0.122 (port 55177) attempted to log in, also resulting in a failed password.
   - The system logged additional details, such as `input_userauth_request: invalid user admin [preauth]` and `pam_unix(sshd:auth): check pass; user unknown`, indicating that the user 'admin' does not exist.
   - Authentication failure was recorded with `pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=103.99.0.122`.

2. **Failed Login Attempts for 'support'**:
   - At 09:11:23, an invalid user 'support' from 103.99.0.122 attempted to log in, resulting in a failed password.
   - Similar to the 'admin' attempts, the system logged `input_userauth_request: invalid user support [preauth]` and `pam_unix(sshd:auth): check pass; user unknown`.
   - Another authentication failure was recorded at 09:11:25, with `pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=103.99.0.122`.

3. **Failed Login Attempts for 'user'**:
   - At 09:11:26, an invalid user 'user' from 103.99.0.122 (port 62581) attempted to log in, resulting in a failed password.
   - The system logged `input_userauth_request: invalid user user [preauth]` and `pam_unix(sshd:auth): check pass; user unknown`.
   - Another authentication failure was recorded with `pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=103.99.0.122`.

4. **Additional Details**:
   - The log includes multiple instances of `error: Received disconnect from 103.99.0.122: 14: No more user authentication methods available. [preauth]`, indicating that the client exhausted all available authentication methods without success.

In summary, this log chunk captures a series of failed login attempts from the IP address 103.99.0.122, targeting non-existent users 'admin', 'support', and 'user' via the SSH service. The system consistently rejected these attempts due to invalid usernames and incorrect passwords.
