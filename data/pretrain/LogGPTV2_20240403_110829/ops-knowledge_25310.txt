I am attempting to install the `python-recsys` module, but I encounter the following error:

```
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python-recsys
(from versions: ) No matching distribution found for python-recsys
```

I am currently using Python 3.4, and the command I used to install the module is:

```
pip.exe install python-recsys
```

**Assistant:** The `python-recsys` module is not compatible with Python 3.x; it only supports Python 2.7. 

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:
1. **Use Python 2.7**: If possible, you can switch to Python 2.7 to use the `python-recsys` module.
2. **Find an Alternative Library**: Consider using a different recommendation system library that is compatible with Python 3.x, such as `surprise`, `lightfm`, or `scikit-surprise`.

For example, to install `surprise`, you can use the following command:

```sh
pip install scikit-surprise
```

This should help you get started with a recommendation system in Python 3.4.
