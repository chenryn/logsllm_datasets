User: I'm looking for simple ways to monitor and limit the number of instances of our application under Terminal Server (2003 and 2008).
The purpose of this restriction is to make sure we don't overload our servers. This is an internal administrative requirement - I am not looking for a licensing solution.
The application in question is written in Python 2.6 (32-bit) but I'm happy to receive development tool agnostic answers. Although we are not using Citrix, I am happy to receive Citrix related ideas with the hope that I can use a similar technique with Terminal Server.
Assistant: Based on feedback on the Python Win32 API mailing list I'm also considering one of the following techniques:

Using Windows Semaphores
Using a pool of Mutexes (offer better recoverability than semaphores)
Using a range of ports
