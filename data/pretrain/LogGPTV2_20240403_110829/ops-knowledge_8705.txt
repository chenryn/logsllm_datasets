User: I have a Debian system currently running with python 2.5.4. I got virtualenv properly installed, everything is working fine. Is there a possibility that I can use a virtualenv with a different version of Python?
I compiled Python 2.6.2 and would like to use it with some virtualenv. Is it enough to overwrite the binary file? Or do I have to change something in respect to the libraries?
Assistant: It worked for me on windows with python 2 installation :

Step 1: Install python 3 version . 
Step 2: create a env folder for
    the virtual environment.
Step 3 : c:\Python37\python -m venv
    c:\path\to\env.

This is how i created Python 3 virtual environment on my existing python 2 installation.
