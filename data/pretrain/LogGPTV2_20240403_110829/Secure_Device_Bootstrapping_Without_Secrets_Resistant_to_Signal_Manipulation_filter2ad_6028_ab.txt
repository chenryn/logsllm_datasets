chronization is achieved with any known method such as [33],
and it is already a necessary requirement for many standardized
MAC protocols that follow a time slotted system [34]–[37].
Adversary (M ): We consider an active adversary that aims
at (a) pairing with A as a legitimate device and (b) spooﬁng a
rogue hub that is joined by at least one legitimate device. We
do not address DoS attacks such as jamming, simply aiming
at preventing the pairing of legitimate devices without gaining

access to the system. All entities are located within the same
collision domain and can overhear broadcast transmissions.
B. Threat Model
We consider an adversary that
is aware of the protocol
executed by the legitimate parties but does not have physical
access to any of the devices. Because the bootstrapping process
is initiated by the user, the adversary can only hijack an ongoing
session. This can be achieved by launching an MitM attack and
modifying the wireless transmissions during the bootstrapping
session. We analyze the feasibility of the MitM attack when
the adversary deploys a single device. We further discuss the
feasibility and complexity of a multi-device MitM attack.
y = hDAx,
1) MitM attack by a single device: Let a legitimate device
D transmit a message m to the hub A. To perform an
(cid:2). Let
MitM attack, the adversary has to replace m with m
x = {x(1), x(2), . . . , x(k)} denote the transmitted symbols
modulating m and y = {y(1), y(2), . . . , y(k)} the received
symbols at A. Then,

where hDA = αDA· ejφDA is the impulse response of the D-A
channel, αDA is the channel attenuation factor, and φDA is the
channel’s phase shift. Here, we have assumed that the entire
transmission of x completes within the channel’s coherence
time, so the channel remains constant. To modify y,
the
adversary M must transmit x(cid:2), modiﬁed by the M-A channel
to y(cid:2) = hM Ax(cid:2) such that the superposition yM = y + y(cid:2)
decodes to m
(cid:2). In other words, M must compute
x(cid:2) =
1
(yM − hDAx),
hM A
(2)
and transmit x(cid:2) in a timely fashion such that y and y(cid:2) are
superimposed as shown in Fig. 4(a). According to equation (2),
the computation of x(cid:2) requires the knowledge of the signal x
transmitted by D and of the channels hDA and hM A. Moreover,
the reception of y(cid:2) must be synchronized with the reception of
y such that y(cid:2) arrives at A within an acceptable delay spread
τA for correct symbol superposition [38]. Synchronization can
be achieved using the preambles or the pilot symbols from the
device; such methods are discussed in detail in [33]. The delay
spread requirement imposes an important physical constraint
on M’s locations. The difference between the adversary’s path,
and the direct path must satisfy
dDM + dM A − dDA ≤ τA · c,
(3)
where dXY denotes the distance between X and Y and c is
the speed of light.
When the signal x is MC ON-OFF encoded, denoted by [x],
modiﬁcation of the received signal to yM requires some ON
slots of [x] to be annihilated, i.e., the amplitude of yM must
be below the signal detection threshold (typically 10s of dBms
below zero) in some slots. Hence, the adversary must be capable
of carrying out a signal cancellation attack. We primarily focus
on the cancellation scenario, because it is more challenging to
achieve than shifting the original constellation point closer to
another point in the I-Q plane. The latter can be achieved by
launching an overshadowing attack [39].
Practically, obtaining x in advance to compute x(cid:2)
is not
possible. This is because D can transmit random symbols to
implement an ON slot when ON-OFF keying is used. These
symbols do not need to belong to a particular modulation mode
such as BPSK, QPSK, etc. Alternatively, the adversary can
avoid the requirement of knowing x, by performing a relay
attack. In this attack, the adversary’s position is strategically
selected such that the path difference between the direct path
and the adversary’s path satisﬁes:
(4)
dDM + dM A − dDA = (2w + 1) λ
2 , w = 0, 1, 2, . . .
where λ denotes the wavelength. This guarantees that
the
inverse of y will be received at A when the incoming signal
at M is compensated for the respective channel attenuation
factors. Because the path difference is an odd multiple of λ/2,
y and y(cid:2) arrive at A with opposite phases, thus canceling
each other (yM = 0). The signal superposition at A for a
cancellation attack is shown in Fig. 4(b). To enable a fast and
error-free relay operation, the adversary may be equipped with
directional antennas, one for receiving the transmission of D
and one for relaying x(cid:2). (4) can be generalized for the adversary
who is capable of modifying the phase (φM A) of the relayed
signal in real time. From a geometric standpoint, modifying the
phase of the incoming signal only changes the set of ellipses
that yield cancellation. The new set of ellipses must satisfy,
dDM +dM A−dDA = (2w+1) λ
2
We note that the phase calculations in (5) assume a strong
Line-of-Sight (LoS) environment between all three entities.
This is the best-case scenario for M, as it allows the calculation
of a location from where cancellation via relaying becomes
possible, without knowing x and by modeling hDA, since the
latter cannot be directly measured. In the general case, x arrives
at A via multiple paths which hardens channel modeling. In
our model, we consider this best-case scenario for the attacker,
where the channel is predictable with a strong LoS.

centered at D and A that satisﬁes a path difference of (2w + 1)λ/2 and does
not violate the maximum delay spread τA.
shifted by (2w + 1)π and attenuated differently. Therefore, M
does not need to know the transmitted symbols a priori. To
compensate for the attenuation difference, M must only know
the attenuation factors αDA, αDM , and αM A in the impulse
responses hDA, hDM , and hM A, respectively. Some of these
channels (hDM , and hM A) can be measured, whereas the hDA
channel can be modeled after a path loss model.
We now examine the candidate set of M’s locations that lead
to successful cancellation via relaying. The adversary’s location
(cid:8)M must satisfy the phase difference equation in (5) and the
delay spread constraints in (3). For (4) or (5), candidate (cid:8)M
form a series of ellipses with D and the A placed at the two
focal points. The set of such ellipses is shown in Fig. 5 and is
computed by considering all odd integer values of w in (4) or
(5). Finally, the delay spread constraint (3) upper bounds w.
2) MitM attack by multiple coordinated devices: When
the adversary has multiple devices at his disposal, he can
deploy them at multiple locations to perform simultaneous
signal cancellation at more than one receivers. For instance,
each adversarial device may target a single legitimate device.
However, this attack requires online coordination among the
different devices (timely channel sensing, time synchronization,
power coordination, etc.) and the use of highly-directional
transmissions to avoid unintended interference. For IoT scenar-
ios, pairing devices are relatively close, which requires the use
of very narrow beams. Antennas that can achieve such narrow
beams are bulky with many antenna elements and therefore eas-
ily discernible in an IoT environment. Moreover, the attacker’s
cost increases linearly with the number of legitimate devices
that are deployed. We primarily focus on the single device
scenario and comment on the security and limitations of our
scheme under a multi-device adversary.
IV. THE SECURE BOOTSTRAPPING PROTOCOL
In this section, we present an in-band secure bootstrapping
protocol for a group of devices. We ﬁrst describe VERSE, a
PHY-layer message integrity protection primitive that exploits
multiple veriﬁers to detect signal manipulation attacks launched
by an MitM adversary. We then use VERSE to construct an
authenticated pairwise key establishment protocol between a
group of devices and the hub, based on DH key agreement.
A. The VERSE Primitive
Consider a general group protocol in which multiple legit-
imate devices sequentially exchange a set of messages. Let s
denote the protocol transcript. In VERSE, all legitimate devices
Fig. 6: D1, D2, D3 and D4 synchronously transmit [h(s)]. The devices sense
the channel during the OFF slots.
operate as veriﬁers by recording the over-the-air messages.
Each device compiles s and contributes in the integrity veriﬁca-
tion process by broadcasting a transcript digest h(s), where h(·)
is a non-cryptographic hash function. Speciﬁcally, all veriﬁers
synchronously transmit the MC ON-OFF modulated message
[h(s) || h(s)r] where h(s)r is a repetition of the last r bits of
[h(s)]. The synchronous transmission [h(s) || h(s)r] is shown
in Fig. 6. During the OFF slots of the [h(s)] transmission,
veriﬁers sense the wireless channel. If any device Di compiled
(cid:2) (cid:3)= s, there will be at least one OFF slot for which Di
an s
(cid:2)) (cid:3)= h(s) with overwhelming
will sense an ON slot, as h(s
probability. Upon sensing this discrepancy, Di will raise an
alarm by sending only ON slots, essentially jamming the
remainder of the [h(s) || h(s)r] transmission, leading to further
alarms being raised by the rest of the veriﬁers. The addition
of h(s)r guarantees that an alarm will be raised, even if an
integrity violation is detected at the last bit in h(s).
Formally, the VERSE primitive involves the following steps:
1) Compilation of the protocol transcript: Each Di broad-
casts a message mi using its default modulation mode.
These messages are recorded by all Dis. Every Di com-
piles the protocol transcript as s = m1||m2|| . . .||m N .
2) Device Synchronization: A lead device (e.g., the hub)
sends a delimiter to synchronize the clocks of all Dis.
We set the delimiter to be an ON-ON-OFF-OFF-ON-ON
sequence, which is not a valid MC-coded sequence.
3) Transcript digest transmission: Following synchroniza-
tion, Dis transmit [h(s) || h(s)r] synchronously using
MC ON-OFF keying, where h(·) is a non-cryptographic
uniform hash function and h(s)r are the last r bits of h(s).
4) Transcript veriﬁcation: While [h(s) || h(s)r] is being
transmitted, each Di plays the role of a veriﬁer. During
the OFF slots of [h(s) || h(s)r] Dis senses the wireless
channel. If any OFF slot is sensed as ON by Di, then Di
raises an alarm by transmitting ON slots for rest of the
slots in [h(s) || h(s)r]. The [h(s)]r is appended to [h(s)]
to ensure there are sufﬁcient slots to raise an alarm even
if a mismatch is detected at the last ON-OFF bit of [h(s)].
The minimum value of r is two.
An example of VERSE for four devices is shown in Fig. 7.
Initially, the devices exchange messages sequentially, creating
a protocol transcript s. The transmission of m1 is shown in
Fig. 7(a). In the transcript veriﬁcation step shown in Fig. 7(b),
all devices synchronously broadcast [h(s) || h(s)r] and use the
OFF slots to verify the integrity of h(s).
We provide a sketch of VERSE’s security (a detailed analysis

attack against VERSE,
the adversary must ensure that no
alarm is raised. Consider M modifying the protocol transcript

1. Even if M launches an overshadowing
attack against all devices and successfully replaces mi, the
device Di that originated mi compiles s. Because s (cid:3)= sM ,
it follows with overwhelming probability that [h(s) || h(s)r] (cid:3)=
[h(sM ) || h(sM )r], due to the collision resistance property
of h(·). In fact, for a uniform hash function, the two hashes
will differ in approximately half the bits. For the bits where
[h(s) || h(s)r] (cid:3)= [h(sM ) || h(sM )r], Di transmits (receives)
