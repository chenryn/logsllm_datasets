Question: In the context of Message Authentication Codes (MACs), why is it necessary for MACs to be deterministic? (Select all that apply.)
"A": "Determinism ensures that the MAC value is unique for each different message, preventing replay attacks.",
"B": "A deterministic MAC ensures that the same message and key will always produce the same MAC value, necessary for the receiver to verify the message's integrity.",
"C": "Determinism is required to make the MAC computation process faster and more efficient.",
"D": "The deterministic nature of MACs allows for the use of multiple keys for the same message to produce different MAC values for added security."
Answer: B
