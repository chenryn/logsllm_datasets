It would be great to have following features at APIRequest
  1. generics for APIRequestContext methods and for APIResponse, like `APIRequestContext.get(url, options): Promise>` since it's often much more convenient than using assert or casting `any` to desired type manually
  2. ability to set default value for `failOnStatusCode` globally, in beforeEach block or per context instance, since it's often to be used with .json() in order to get JS response body, and json conversion would often get xml error and throw error trying to parse it with not informative message like `SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0` instead of actuial API error description
  3. introduce APIRequestContext methods overloads. It's quite often for testing we don't care about post response except it successful, but when we do we often want to get response body, and it's not quite convenient additionally `await APIResponse.json()`. So it might be useful to be able to define what kind of response do we want to get. For example, Angular httpClient uses options.observe property for this purpose https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/common/http/src/client.ts#L1209
sorry if some feature requests duplicate, originally I was looking only for
failOnStatusCode, but got a little carried away ðŸ™‚
