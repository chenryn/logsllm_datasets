Fig. 3. Duration of internal N periods
signiﬁcantly longer internal silent periods in both the ICSI and CCZ traces. Interest-
ingly, we note that port 443 has longer internal silent periods than port 80 in both
datasets—but more exaggerated in the ICSI dataset. We speculate that this may be due
to more aggressive caching of HTTPS connections to avoid the higher setup cost of
SSL/TLS.
We now turn from focusing on individual internal silent periods to the amount of
aggregate silence we ﬁnd across an entire connection. We calculate the total fraction of
each connection with least one internal silent period that is spent in silence. We ﬁnd that
two thirds of the connections are fairly uniformly distributed between nearly no silence
and roughly 90% silence across the connection. However, in the other one-third of the
connections across datasets over 90% of the connection is silent—with roughly 20%
of the connections in both datasets showing near total silence. The distribution of the
number of silent periods for connections that are at least 90% silent shows that these
connections have more silent periods than the overall distribution (which is shown in
Figure 2)—indicating that a single silent period is not driving the overall behavior.
The Last Window Problem: TCP’s loss recovery depends on the acknowledgment of
packets received. The information in returning ACKs is used to drive retransmission
decisions, by assuming that multiple incoming ACKs that do not acknowledge out-
standing data indicate that the data was lost. However, ACKs are sent only when data
is received, and there is no data after the last window to generate new ACKs. Hence,
it is comparatively more difﬁcult for TCP to determine that the ﬁnal packets of a win-
dow have been lost; in many algorithms, this situation is detected only by a relatively
long retransmission timeout (RTO). TCP also uses ACKs to trigger the transmission of
new data. However, after a period of silence there are no incoming ACKs, and thus this
“ACK clock” cannot be used to immediately pace out new data. This can lead to either
a large burst of segments [7,16] or the need to wait a full RTT for ACKs for the new
data to return [16]. In other words, events that happen in a routine and timely fashion
most of the time can be problematic at the “end” of a connection. A silent period within
a connection can manifest the same behaviors.
Various proposals exist to deal with TCP’s “last window” (e.g., [6]). However, under-
standing the frequency of this phenomenon is crucial to determining how much com-
plexity should be added to TCP to deal with the issue. Our approach to assess this
is to treat the window before a silent period as a “last window” as long as the silent

period is relatively long, which we deﬁne as roughly the length of an RTO. We use this
approximation because of the recommendation that TCP collapse its congestion win-
dow after an RTO worth of idle time [2]. Since the speciﬁcs of the RTO vary across
implementations we use 4 × minRT T as an approximation.
We ﬁnd that 65–71% of the connections have internal silent periods that last at least
4 × minRT T —which represents at least a doubling of last windows (i.e., one internal
and one actual last window). Figure 4 shows the distribution of the number of silent
periods that exceed 4 × minRT T per connection. We ﬁnd that 32% and 24% of the
connections that have internal silent periods for CCZ and ICSI, respectively, have 2–10
silent periods of at least 4 × minRT T . These results show that a non-trivial number of
connections would beneﬁt from techniques that mitigate last window issues.
7 Application Complexity
We next assess the diversity of patterns of activity within connections. For this analysis,
we classify connections into three types: (i) “active” connections consist only of L,
R, and B periods, with no N period, (ii) “simple” connections may have initial and/or
trailing N periods, but all other periods must be L, R, or B (note that active connections
are a subset of simple connections) and (iii) “complex” connections which may have
any combination of periods. Table 3 shows a summary of our analysis. The data suggests
that active and simple connections are much more likely to consist of a small number
of exchanges followed by termination, whereas complex connections—those with at
least one internal N period—display a large diversity of internal structure, involving a
comparatively larger number of exchanges and period transitions.
The tendency of simple connections to be classic bulk transfers is strong. Out of the
CCZ simple connections, 90% of the maps (2.2M connections) consist of no more than
two periods containing data—with 60% being LR, with or without initial and trailing
N periods—suggesting a simple request-response bulk transfer. The ICSI data is some-
what more diverse, with the corresponding maps accounting for 47% of the simple con-
nections. Further, 40% of the connections are either LR or RL with or without initial
and trailing N periods. This suggests that the simple connections in the ICSI dataset are
somewhat more complicated than in the CCZ dataset, but the overall diversity remains
markedly lower than for complex connections.

8 Conclusions
This paper makes several initial contributions: (i) we provide an application agnostic
methodology for studying application patterns from the transport’s perspective, (ii) we
conﬁrm that TCP is non-trivially used for non-bulk transfer applications, which breaks
our often-employed mental model, (iii) while silent periods within connections exist,
they are mostly short, (iv) we ﬁnd that TCP’s “last window” problem is exacerbated
by the transactional nature of some connections and (v) we ﬁnd that connections with
internal silent periods have more complicated interactions than those without such pe-
riods. We stress that this is an initial investigation and the results in some sense offer
more questions than answers—which we are grappling with as future work.
