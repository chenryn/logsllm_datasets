User:  How to use Ansible to automate operation and maintenance? Please provide a simple Ansible script example.
Assistant: Ansible is an automated operation and maintenance tool that supports tasks such as automated deployment, configuration management, and application deployment. Here is an example of a simple Ansible script to install the Nginx web server on a remote host: ``` --- - name: Install Nginx hosts: webserver become: yes tasks: - name: Install Nginx package yum: name: nginx state: present - name: Enable Nginx service service: name: nginx state: enabled - name: Start Nginx service service: name: nginx state: started ``` In the above script, "hosts: webserver" specifies the remote Host, "become: yes" means to execute tasks with sudo privileges. "tasks" is a list defining individual tasks. The script includes three tasks, respectively installing, enabling and starting the Nginx service. Among them, "yum" and "service" are Ansible modules for performing related operations on remote hosts. You can use the "ansible-playbook" command to execute the script, for example: ``` ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml ``` After the execution is complete, the Nginx service should have been installed, enabled, and started on the remote host.
