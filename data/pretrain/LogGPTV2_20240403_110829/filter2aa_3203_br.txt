### Primary and Alternate WINS Server Addresses for the Alternate Configuration

#### Advanced TCP/IP Properties
If you have specified an alternate configuration for a network connection, you can also set the IPv4 addresses of primary and alternate WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) servers. Figure 12-1 illustrates how to configure a primary WINS server on the Alternate Configuration tab.

**Figure 12-1: Configuring Primary and Alternate WINS Servers on the Alternate Configuration Tab**

### Manually Configuring WINS Servers

To manually configure the IPv4 addresses of WINS servers or to adjust additional settings on a WINS client, follow these steps:
1. Open the properties dialog box for the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component.
2. Click the **Advanced** button on the **General** tab.
3. Select the **WINS** tab.

**Figure 12-2: The WINS Tab in the Advanced Configuration of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Component**

On the WINS tab, you can specify an ordered list of WINS servers that the computer will query. The WINS servers configured here take precedence over those received through DHCP.

### Manual Configuration Using Netsh

You can also configure the IPv4 addresses of WINS servers from the command line using the `Netsh` tool with the following command:

```shell
netsh interface ip set wins [name=]ConnectionName [source=]dhcp|static [addr=]IPv4Address|none
```

- **ConnectionName**: The name of the network connection as it appears in the Network Connections folder.
- **source**: Either `dhcp` (sets DHCP as the source for configuring WINS servers) or `static` (sets the source to the WINS tab in the advanced properties).
- **IPv4Address**: The IPv4 address of the WINS server, or `none` to clear the list of WINS servers.

To configure a remote computer, add the `-r RemoteComputer` parameter at the end of the command, where `RemoteComputer` can be specified by either a computer name or an IPv4 address.

### Configuration for Remote Access Clients

Remote access clients (using dial-up or a virtual private network connection) obtain the initial configuration of primary and alternate WINS servers during the negotiation of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connection. This is defined by RFC 1877, which specifies the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) options for Primary NBNS Server Address and Secondary NBNS Server Address.

Computers running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 can use a DHCPInform message to update their list of WINS servers. If a remote access server running Windows Server 2003 is correctly configured with the DHCP Relay Agent routing protocol component, it forwards the DHCPInform message to a DHCP server and returns the response (a DHCPAck message) to the remote access client.

If the remote access client receives a response to the DHCPInform message, the WINS servers in the DHCPAck message replace those configured using IPCP.

### The WINS Server Service

The WINS Server service in Windows Server 2003 supports the following features:
- An RFC-compliant NBNS (NetBIOS Name Service)
- Static mapping maintenance
- WINS server replication

#### Installing the WINS Server Service

To install the WINS Server service on Windows Server 2008:
1. Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, then **Administrative Tools**, and click **Server Manager**.
2. In the console tree, right-click **Features** and select **Add Features**.
3. Under **Features**, select the **WINS Server** check box and click **Next**.
4. Click **Install**.

For Windows Server 2003, you can install the WINS Server service via:
- The **Add or Remove Programs** item in Control Panel
- The **Manage Your Server Wizard**

To install the WINS Server service using the Add or Remove Programs item in Control Panel:
1. Click **Start**, then **Control Panel**.
2. Double-click **Add or Remove Programs** and click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
3. Select the **Networking Services** check box and click **Details**.
4. In the **Subcomponents of Networking Services**, select the **Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)** check box, click **OK**, and then **Next**.
5. If prompted, enter the full path to the installation files for Windows Server 2003 and click **OK**.

To install and configure the WINS Server service, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer or have been delegated the appropriate authority. If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group may also perform this procedure.

### Configuring the WINS Server

To modify the properties of a WINS server, open the WINS snap-in, right-click the server name in the tree, and select **Properties**. Figure 12-3 shows the resulting properties dialog box.

**Figure 12-3: Properties Dialog Box for a WINS Server**

From this dialog box, you can configure the following tabs:
- **General**: Specify the refresh interval for WINS statistics, the path to the WINS backup database, and whether to back up the WINS database when the service is shut down.
- **Intervals**: Set various WINS server timers, as listed in Table 12-1.
- **Database Verification**: Enable periodic checking of database consistency to maintain integrity.
- **Advanced**: Enable detailed event logging, burst handling, and specify the WINS database path and starting version ID number.

**Table 12-1: WINS Server Timers**

| Configuration Option | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Renewal Interval | Specifies how often a client must re-register its name. Default is six days. |
| Extinction Interval | Specifies the interval between when a database entry is marked as released and when it is marked as extinct. Default depends on the renewal interval and replication time. |
| Extinction Timeout | Specifies the interval between when an entry is marked extinct and when it is removed from the database. Default is six days. |
| Verification Interval | Specifies the interval after which the WINS server verifies old names. Default depends on the extinction interval. |

### Static Entries for Non-WINS Clients

If a WINS client tries to connect to a non-WINS client on a remote subnet, the name of the non-WINS client cannot be resolved. To resolve this, you can configure static mappings of the NetBIOS names used by each non-WINS client to their IPv4 addresses in the WINS server database.

To configure a static mapping:
1. Open the WINS snap-in, open a server name in the tree, right-click **Active Registrations**, and select **New Static Mapping**.
2. In the **New Static Mapping** dialog box, enter the computer name of the non-WINS client.
3. If needed, enter the NetBIOS scope ID.
4. Select the entry type (unique, group, domain name, internet group, or multihomed).
5. Enter the IPv4 address of the non-WINS client.
6. Click **OK**.

**Table 12-2: Static WINS Mapping Type Options**

| Type Option | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Unique | A unique name maps to a single IPv4 address. |
| Group | A normal group where the WINS database does not store individual member addresses. |
| Domain Name | A NetBIOS name-to-IPv4 address mapping with 0x1C as the 16th byte. |
| Internet Group | User-defined groups that can store up to 25 addresses for members. |
| Multihomed | A unique name with multiple addresses, used for computers with multiple network adapters. |

**Figure 12-4: Example of a WINS Static Mapping**

### Database Replication Between WINS Servers

You can configure all WINS servers on a network to fully replicate their database entries. This ensures that a name registered with one WINS server is eventually replicated to all other WINS servers, allowing any WINS client to resolve any valid NetBIOS name on the network.

To replicate database entries between a pair of WINS servers, configure each WINS server as a pull partner, push partner, or both.

- **Push Partner**: A WINS server that sends a message to its pull partners, notifying them of new entries. When a pull partner responds with a replication request, the push partner sends the new entries.
- **Pull Partner**: A WINS server that requests new WINS database entries from its push partners, pulling entries with a higher version number than the last received.

**Figure 12-5: Example Push-and-Pull Partner Configuration and Information Flow**

Typically, two WINS servers exchange information in both directions, acting as both push and pull partners. WINS servers only replicate new entries, not the entire database.

### Push and Pull Operations

- **Push Operation**: Initiated by a WINS server when a certain number of entries have changed. The server sends a "Have new entries" notification to pull partners, who respond with a "Send new entries" notification.
- **Pull Operation**: Initiated by a pull partner at scheduled times, regardless of the number of entries. The pull partner sends a "Send new entries" notification, and the push partner responds with the new entries.

**Figure 12-6: The Push Operation**
**Figure 12-7: The Pull Operation**

### Configuring WINS Server Replication

When configuring WINS server replication, consider the following:
- Use pull replication between sites, especially across slow links, as it can be scheduled.
- Use push replication for fast links, as it occurs when a configured number of updated entries is reached.

**Figure 12-8: Example of a WINS Server Replication Configuration**

In this example, all WINS servers at each site use push replication to send their new database entries to a single server at their site.
