Elevator phone systems basics
● POTS (plain old telephone service) this is in most 
elevators it's how a phone will dial out. 
● The device will dial when the hand set is picked up 
or when the button is pushed.
● ADA/ASME A17 is the reason we have changes in 
our elevator phones. Also there are building codes 
that need to be followed.

● http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.html  
● 1234 and 123456 are both at the top of the charts for the most 
common pins. 
● The 4 pin code you have a 26.83% chance of getting it right this 
drops down to 16.12% if 1234 doesn’t work.
● A 6 pin code you have a 20.21% chance of getting it right with

● 60 elevators at Brown University
● Each of those elevators has their own telephone line.
● 30 days x 24 hours = 720 hours
● 720 hours x 60 minutes = 43,200 minute in a month
● 43,200 x 60 elevators = 2,592,000 elevator minutes 
● 2,592,000 x $2.55 per minute = $6,609,600

Are we all doomed?!?
Look at:
● Monitoring (Why are we having an hour long 
call?)
● Logging (Why do 30 people call the elevator a 
day?)
● Alerting (Is there really an emergency?... We 
should deal with that)
