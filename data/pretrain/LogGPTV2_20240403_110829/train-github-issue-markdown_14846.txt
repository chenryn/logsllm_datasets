# Environment
    Windows build number: [10.0.18362.295]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.4.2382.0
    Any other software?
    MSYS2 / MINGW64:
      $ uname -srvo
      MINGW64_NT-10.0-18362 3.0.7-338.x86_64 2019-07-11 10:58 UTC Msys
      $ bash --version
      GNU bash, version 4.4.23(1)-release (x86_64-pc-msys)
    Emacs from MSYS2's mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs package:
      (emacs-version)
      "GNU Emacs 26.2 (build 1, x86_64-w64-mingw32)
       of 2019-06-03"
# Steps to reproduce
  * Run MSYS2 / MINGW64 bash in Windows Terminal, e.g. in a CMD tab with  
`set MSYSTEM=MINGW64&& c:\msys64\usr\bin\bash --login -i`
  * Run Emacs in the terminal (`emacs -nw`) and quit it immediately
  * Back at the bash prompt, enter a few characters, say `123`
  * Press the left-arrow as often as needed to move the cursor to the  
beginning of the line (in this example 3 times)
  * Enter some other characters
# Expected behavior
  * The cursor moves with the left-arrow keystrokes to the beginning of the line
  * New text appears line start
# Actual behavior
  * The cursor stays at the end of the line, although the internal position is updated  
and new text appears at line start.
  * When I delete text using Backspace or Delete, the cursor jumps to the correct position,  
but jumps back to the end of line when new text is entered.
It seems that MINGW Emacs and MSYS2 bash don't play well in Windows Terminal
-- in  
the classic Windows console there is no issue.
