# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
Loader options publicPath doesn't seem to have any effect of for given
outputs.  
See more info on this issue originally made for `mini-css-extract-plugin`
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
**What is the expected behavior?**
publicPath given to loader options should effectively make given assets be
served from their given destination - what happens instead is:
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.css$/,
          use: [
            {
              loader: MiniCSSExtractPlugin.loader,
              options: {
                publicPath: "/styles/",
    	   }
             },
             "css-loader?-url",
    	 "postcss-loader"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    // The given assets do NOT end in said directory:
    plugins: [
       new MiniCSSExtractPlugin({ 
         filename:      "[name].[hash].css",
         chunkFileName: "[id].[hash].css" 
       })
    ]
The said styles directory is ignored and all of the files are bundled with the
rest of the JS bundles.
**Other relevant information:**
Even the simplest configuration without `mini-css-extract-plugin` does not
work.  
Tested with `html-webpack-plugin` and without, no difference in ##behaviour.
