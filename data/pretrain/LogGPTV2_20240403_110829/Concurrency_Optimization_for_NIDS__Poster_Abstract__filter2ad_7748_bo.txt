chemistry, and botany, to name just a few In the last years, NP’s discovery process is experiencing a technological breakthrough New approaches 
have been incorporated altering traditional concepts and perceptions One of these approaches, which was rapidly embraced by the experts in 
the fiend of NPs, is metabolomics NP metabolomics, have been rapidly employed for the study of natural entities in a more holistic way, finding 
multiple applications and uses Thus, they have been incorporated for chemotaxonomic studies, safety and toxicity assessment, quality control, 
plant defense, exploration of physiological and biochemical effects in different environmental and stress conditions as well as for the investigation 
of the physiological development of different organisms and drug discovery The integration and harmonization of metabolomics with traditional and 
contemporary methods and approaches effectively facilitates the NPs research In the context of this talk, different applications of NP metabolomics 
will be presented using specific examples related to NP drug discovery, chemotaxonomy and quality control of natural entities such as medicinal

The “GutMatters” project, funded by the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF), aims at defining the prevalence of gut health disorders 
and their incidence in sea farmed Atlantic salmon The project plan included the sampling of a total of 360 salmons from 6 farm sites along the 
Norwegian coast and over one year period (3 time points) Histopathological analysis, performed on gut samples, revealed inflammatory changes 
predominantly in the distal intestine but also in the whole intestinal tract in fish with chronic cestode parasitosis Additionally, enterocyte steatosis 
was observed in the pyloric caeca of individuals collected in most of the farm sites HR-MAS (high resolution magic angle spinning) 1H-NMR (proton 
nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy was used for the first time to analyze intact fecal samples collected from the pyloric caeca and distal 
intestine of Atlantic salmons The samples were measured on a 400 MHz spectrometer The results of the metabolomics analysis evidenced a 
similar metabolic composition for the samples from the two intestinal regions Amino acids (ie alanine, methionine, and phenylalanine), organic 
acids (ie lactic acid) and sugars were found to be the main components of the fecal metabolome Significant alterations in the lipid composition of 
the fecal samples were observed as a result of both dyslipidemia and gut inflammation

CO-AUTHORS: Catherine Deborde, Nadège Richard, Sandrine Skiba-Cassy, Annick Moing, Benoit Fauconneau
The growing industry of aquaculture faces the limited availability of marine resources used to feed farmed fish The development of plant-based 
diets alleviates this bottleneck, but carnivorous fish such as rainbow trout still do not tolerate diets based on plant ingredients only Our objective 
was to explore fish responses to plant-based diets complemented with alternative raw materials: insect, microalgae, yeast or processed animal 
proteins Metabolites were profiled in fish tissues and biofluids using NMR We also analysed the composition of alternative raw materials to identify 
compounds susceptible to operate in fish metabolism The relevance of metabolomics in fish nutrition is illustrated with three results (1) Histidine, 
an essential amino acid, was negatively correlated in muscle and plasma with the specific growth rate whatever the diet In fish, it is considered 
as a protective buffer agent and prevents the decrease of glycolytic flux during anaerobic process (2) Betaine, glycine and serine signals were 
modified in the muscle of fish fed plant-based diet compared to a commercial one This may correspond to a one-carbon metabolism alteration or 
to an accumulation from raw material compounds (3) A quinone compound, specific of microalgae, could be used to assess their incorporation in 
diet: it was present in raw material and in the liver of fish fed microalgae Such an approach opens new ways to integrate the interpretation of fish 
metabolism in diet effect studies Funding: FUI 2014 (NINAQUA with Le Gouessant, COPALIS, Algae Natural Food, Phileo-Lesaffre Animal Care),

Metabolomics, mixture models and maggots: solutions to agricultural waste problems and food security
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Elizabeth Dickinson, University of York, United Kingdom

Jason Hallet, Adrian Charlton, Julie Wilson
Food security is a global challenge and industrial waste biomass is a major environmental problem Palm oil waste is currently burned as a means 
of disposal, and solutions are required to reduce this industry’s environmental impact Palm waste can be recycled into biogas, however, we aimed 
to optimise conditions for recycling into a nutritious substrate for farmed insects As a natural component of the diet of farmed animals such as fish, 
chicken and pigs, fly larvae could meet the increasing demand for protein in animal feed, and can be grown on plant waste Palm waste is tough 
and needs to be broken down using microbes (anaerobic digestion), providing a substrate for larvae and producing methane gas, a sustainable 
energy source However, digestion processes require adjustments and optimisation, therefore composition of the substrate was investigated NMR 
spectroscopy and LC-HRMS were used to analyse palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) after various pre-processing methods, then after anaerobic 
digestion Biogas production was also measured Statistical pattern recognition techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), were 
used to investigate compositional differences before and after digestion, and partial least squares regression (PLS-R) was used to produce models 
predicting biogas production Digested EFB were submitted for preliminary insect feeding trials Subsequently, various domestic waste biomass 
was submitted for larvae feeding trials and analysed by NMR spectroscopy Statistical models are being developed to determine the best mixture of 
these waste streams to produce the most nutritious substrate for larvae, providing an energy-neutral starting point for optimum insect rearing

Unravelling the Flavour of White Asparagus using Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Eirini Pegiou, MSc., Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Roland Mumm, Robert Hall
Metabolomics has wide application in plant and food analysis This includes variety differentiation, identification and monitoring of biomarkers 
for food quality and assessment of improved food products Food processing often negatively impacts food quality attributes, such as flavour 
Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is valued for its nutrients and characteristic flavour Currently more than 30% of the harvested product is discarded 
as waste due to the harvesting process and strict market requirements However, this (waste) material could be useful for the production of 
asparagus powder for use as an ingredient in soups and sauces With the current drying techniques the characteristic asparagus flavour is not well 
retained, provoking the need for additional artificial supplements In this project we aim to evaluate the flavour profile of processed white asparagus 
materials, in comparison with fresh white asparagus By analyzing products from different drying processes, we aim to define the optimal conditions 
which maintain maximum flavour We use targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to evaluate asparagus aroma using GC-MS Results 
reveal the complexity of the biochemical composition of fresh and cooked asparagus and how this is modified during processing Interpreting the 
effect of different drying strategies on the asparagus aroma is helping us to define an optimal drying process, while contemplating food naturalness 
The outcome of this project will enable current crop waste materials to be converted into high value and high quality dried food components

The application of metabolomics to livestock research lags far behind other applications of metabolomics To further facilitate livestock 
metabolomics research, we have: 1) created a freely accessible online database called the Livestock Metabolome Database  
(LMDB; wwwlmdbca) that contains comprehensive metabolomic data for 5 common livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and pigs) 
and 2) performed a detailed experimental characterization of the sheep metabolome The LMDB is expected to serve as a general hub to support 
metabolomics studies in livestock research This database currently holds 1070 metabolites extracted from existing literature and our experimental 
data collected from studies of cow and sheep metabolomes Our sheep metabolomic work focuses on profiling the blood metabolome of healthy 
sheep for marker-assisted prediction of economically important production traits including feed efficiency, carcass merit, pregnancy and litter 
size Initial analyses for feed efficiency (n=250) using NMR, ICP-MS, and DI/LC-MS/MS have identified and quantified 191 serum/blood metabolites 
A panel of 5 candidate biomarkers (AUC>07) distinguishes between lambs with high and low feed efficiency In a second study, 158 serum 
metabolites were identified and quantified from pregnant sheep (n=500) with 3 candidate biomarkers (AUC=095) that differentiate pregnant from 
non-pregnant ewes, 35 days into gestation We have also identified a different pattern in the serum metabolome between pregnant ewes carrying a 
single fetus versus those carrying multiples These results are currently being validated using additional serum samples (n=900) These projects will 
expand the LMDB and help develop a “pen-side” metabolomic test to facilitate farm management practices and animal selection

Change of volatile metabolites in strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) spoiled by fungi during decay
PRESENTING AUTHOR: SU-YEON NA, EWHA WOMANS UNIVERSITY, South Korea
Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) is one of the major fruits cultivated all over the world However, it is highly susceptible to spoilage during shipping 
and storage, mainly due to food-borne pathogens In this study, Cladosporium cladosporioides, which is known as a major pathogen of strawberries, 
was isolated from strawberries infected and inoculated onto disease-free strawberry fruits After the inoculation of fungi, the decay of strawberries 
was measured every 12 hours for 3 1⁄2 days Then, volatile metabolites produced by fungi grown on strawberry were analyzed and compared 
during decay periods Volatile metabolites of the spoiled strawberries were extracted by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and analyzed by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) during decay Among them, 3-ethylbenzaldehyde, xylene, propan-2-yl butanoate, hex-2-enyl 
acetate, ethyl octanoate and propan-2-yl acetate were significantly reduced according to the decay periods On the other hand, 2-methylbutan-1-
ol, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, methyl 2-methylbutanoate, methyl (Z)-N-hydroxybenzenecarboximidate and caryophyllene gradually increased over decay 
periods In particular, styrene, which is a well-known fungal volatile compound produced from phenylalanine, was produced at relatively high level 
and significantly increased from 48 hours to 60 hours Also, data sets were processed by partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) 
to evaluate the differences in volatile metabolites according to the decay time The application of PLS-DA revealed that the strawberry samples 
corrupted by Ccladosporioides could be distinguished according to decay time Also, major volatile metabolites related to decay were determined 
The significant volatile metabolites related to latter state of decay were benzaldehyde, styrene and 2-methylbutyl acetate

Non-targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach for authentication of organic leaf vegetables
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ka Yi MAN, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong
Vegetables are an important food source providing essential nutrients, fiber and bioactive phytochemicals The global trend for consumption 
of organic vegetable, such as tomatoes, potatoes and leaf vegetables, was increasing rapidly over the last few decades because of the raising 
demand for healthier and safer diet as well as the raising concerns on environmental sustainability Despite its profitable prospect and high demand 
in market, a reliable method to verify whether the plants are cultivated using organic practices is absence By using non-targeted metabolomics 
approach, it is possible to acquire comprehensive information on the composition of the metabolite profiles that can be used to identify farming 
methods In this research, four types of common leaf vegetables in Hong Kong (n=124), including Amaranthus tricolor L (red amaranth), Brassica rapa 
var parachinensis (choy sum), Ipomoea aquatica Forsk (water spinach) and Lactuca sativa L (lettuce), were collected from Hong Kong accredited 
farms and certificated organic farms Non-targeted MS-based metabolomics analysis of aqueous and organic layers from liquid-liquid extraction 
reveals the difference in small molecules profile and lipid profile of leaf vegetables The result from this study demonstrates that the species and 
farming methods can be discriminated by a set of primary metabolites and plant lipids

Water availability in the soil and its effects on tropane alkaloid metabolism in Datura stramonium
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Fredd Vergara, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, iDiv, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Abigail Moreno-Pedraza, Gabriel Jennifer
Datura stramonium is an annual plant that produces tropane alkaloids Atropine and scopolamine are two of the most studied alkaloids in D 
stramonium Atropine and scopolamine are non-selective muscarinic acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Atropine and scopolamine affect the central 
nervous system in animals and act as chemical defenses against herbivores Molecules of atropine and scopolamine contain nitrogen There is 
no evidence that D stramonium stablishes symbiosis with nitrogen (N2) fixing bacteria Thus, D stramonium obtains nitrogen (NO3-) from the soil 
The process of nitrogen assimilation requires the dissolving of NO3- in water It is foreseeable that the availability of water in the soil influences 
the assimilability of NO3- by the roots of D stramonium In turn, the assimilability of NO3- can affect tropane alkaloids biosynthesis To test this 
hypothesis we set up an experiment with different irrigations To estimate the assimilability of NO3- we used tensiometers to quantify the soil water 
pressure We analyzed different organs of D stramonium grown under different irrigations using a non-targeted metabolomics approach (LC-
qToF) We also determined the percentages of elemental carbon and nitrogen in different organs Finally, we performed an absolute quantitation of 
atropine and scopolamine (LC-QqQ) We identified irrigations correlated with maximum production of tropane alkaloids These findings are relevant 
in understanding herbivory patterns in nature

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Akira Oikawa, Yamagata University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Akira Oikawa, Yamato Horibe, Kei Morita, Katsutaka Takeuchi, Yasutaka Shimizu, Ryosuke Sasaki, Kazuki Saito, Hideki Murayama
Quality of agricultural products is affected by long-term climate changes such as drought and high temperature Local and short-term climate 
conditions also have effects on the ingredient in agricultural products In this study, we focus on the relation between the metabolite changes in 
edamame (green soybean) and the climate conditions around the harvest days Edamame was harvested every day of about 10 days for 6 years at 
the same field Ionic metabolites and neutral sugars in the harvested edamame were comprehensively analyzed by using capillary electrophoresis 
mass spectrometer (CE-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LC-MS), respectively The climate conditions around harvest days were 
also recorded on the every day The results of the correlation analysis between the data of the edamame metabolome and the climate conditions 
revealed that the amounts of some metabolites in edamame were changed depending on the temperature and the day length around the harvest 
days Especially, the amounts of lysine in the harvested edamame and the integrated temperature for 5 days before harvest were significantly 
correlated Moreover, the amount of sucrose showed weak correlation with the length of day light Furthermore, although it showed no significant 
differences, the temperature at the harvest day was inclined to be positively or negatively correlated to the amounts of several metabolites These 
results showed the clear relations between the climate around the harvest day and the quality of the harvested edamame, which might lead to add 
values to agricultural products according to a new viewpoint

A Fast LC-QqQ-MS/MS Method for the Quantification of Phytohormones in Stems of Forest Tree Species
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ana Margarida Rodrigues, ITQB NOVA, Portugal
CO-AUTHORS: Ana Margarida Rodrigues, Swen Langer, Ed Bergström, David Harvey, Tony Larson, Jane Thomas-Oates, Carla António
Phytohormones are key low-abundant metabolites with a critical signaling role to internal and external cues, namely in mediating plant growth 
and development processes, adaptation to adverse environmental conditions or defence responses Phytohormones belong to different classes, 
according to their chemical structure, and are present at very low concentrations in plants, which makes them challenging metabolites to quantify 
accurately Thus, continuous improvements of sensitive analytical techniques able to quantify several phytohormones in a single run, and in 
different plant tissues, are needed Moreover, most published analytical methods for quantitative analysis of phytohormones were validated for 
Arabidopsis or crop species, and very few were optimised for complex matrices as forest tree species The aim of this study was to validate a simple, 
fast and sensitive analytical method for the quantitative analysis of 14 phytohormones, belonging to six major classes, in the complex matrix of Pinus 
pinaster Ait stem tissues, using the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer LC-MS system (LC-QqQ-MS/MS) to take advantage of the high-resolution 
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for higher sensitivity and selectivity This method is fast, reliable, and sensitive, and allows the quantification of 
14 phytohormones in a single run (66 min) Details on the key analytical validation steps will be presented, namely (i) establishment of calibration 
curves and assay linearity, (ii) assessment of matrix effects on metabolite quantification, (iii) assessment of the limit of detection and limit of 
quantification, (iv) assessment of the analytical recoveries during metabolite extraction, and finally (v) determination of the precision of the method

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sung-Dug Oh, Rural Development Administration, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Ancheol Chang, Sang Jae Suh, Soo-Yun Park
Metabolomics is a useful tool for determining phenotypic variation in plants This study aimed to identify the primary metabolites and bioactive 
secondary metabolites from seeds of wild soybean (Glycine soja) and Korean commercial cultivar (Glycine max, cv Gwangan) and to explore 
metabolic differences between their genotypes We profiled abundant hydrophilic primary metabolite and lipophilic secondary metabolites using 
gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) Data obtained were subjected to multivariate statistical analyses, principal 
component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and hierachical clustering analysis to determine phenotypic variation 
and relationships between metabolite contents The identification and profiling of metabolites using GC-TOFMS analysis allows clear discrimination 
between soybean genotypes This study determined comprehensive metabolic differences between soybean seeds with different genotypes and 
provides useful information for genetic manipulation of soybean to influence primary and secondary metabolism

A GC-MS platform for assessing the diversity of fruit and leaf volatiles
PRESENTING AUTHOR: JOSÉ L. RAMBLA, Jaume I University. Department of of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Aurelio Gómez-Cadenas, Antonio Granell
Volatile compounds are important molecules in plants which are involved in several independent processes Fruit volatiles have a role in the 
attraction of seed dispersers, and are key compounds in the human perception of fruit flavour Vegetative tissues also modify their pattern of volatile 
emission in response to external factors such as the presence of insects and microorganisms, using them as a language for communication with 
other plant organs and with another plants, and also to communicate with other living organisms such as insects Here we present some results 
obtained from our platform for the determination of plant volatiles based on capture by means of Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-
SPME) and separation and detection by means of Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) This platform was used for the 
characterization of volatile compounds in different fleshy fruit species, many of them with an impact in fruit flavour, and enabled the identification of 
genome regions and several genes involved in their biosynthesis Additionally, a non-targeted approach also allowed the identification of volatile 
compounds involved in the response of vegetative tissues against both microbial and pest attacks, shedding some light in the mechanisms involved 
in plant defence

Onions are among the most popular and economically most important vegetables worldwide and contain a range of health-beneficial compounds 
Under appropriate conditions, onions can be stored for up to nine months Modern conventional farming heavily relies on the use of hybrid varieties 
which may lead to genetic erosion and a loss of biodiversity The use of open-pollinated landraces and their further development by breeding 
may be a viable alternative, especially for organic farming In this trial, we examined the metabolite profiles of nine landraces and a commercial 
control variety (Sturon) in the fresh state and after cold storage for up to five months at 2-3°C and <60% relative air humidity Quantitative basic 
analyses as well as an untargeted GC×GC–MS analysis were performed More than 200 onion metabolites were relatively quantified In the fresh 
state, nine varieties could be separated into three groups, mainly according to differences in the sugar and amino acid profiles The variety “Jaune 
des Cévennes” was characterized by remarkably low fructan levels and a higher content of monosaccharides While this variety suffered from 
increasing Botrytis and Aspergillus infestations already after two month of cold storage, all other varieties demonstrated minimal water loss and 
no visual appearance of degradation even after five months Storage lead, among others, to increased levels of glutamine, glutamate, asparagine, 
phenylalanine, serine, several sulfur-containing amino acids, fructose, sucrose, xylose, trehalose, raffinose, myo-inositol, phosphate, malate and a 
substantial decrease in, eg, citrate, nystose and other di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides

Increased throughput and coverage for the annotation of Saponins using a structure-based MSn approach on a Tribrid 
Orbitrap mass spectrometer
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Reiko Kiyonami, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Caroline Ding, Seema Sharma, Andreas Huhmer
Saponins are major components of Chinese medicines and exert various pharmacological effects, such as cardiovascular protective activity and 
anticancer activity Plus, they could reduce the side-effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy The comprehensive annotation of Saponins from 
various Chinese medicines remains challenging because of the limited availability of authentic standards and the structural diversity of this class 
of compounds Taking advantages of high resolution MS and MSn capability offered by the tribrid Oribitrap mass spectrometer, we developed a 
product ion-dependent MSn data acquisition method in which MS2 data is constantly collected and further followed by higher order FTMSn if sugar 
neutral lose are detected from the MS2 data The collected MSn tree data were used to identify the Saponin class compounds which contain the 
triterpenoid or spirostane aglycones Chemspider and custom databases are further used for final saponin structure annotation As the proof of 
concept, 80% methanol extracts from Sanqi, a Chinese medicine was analyzed A Thermo Scientific™ Orbitrap ID-X™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer was 
used for collecting HRAM MS and MSn (up to MS4) data The MSn data were searched against msCloud spectral library using Thermo Scientific™ 
Mass Frontier ™ 80 software for identifying the saponin class compounds The novel structure ranking tools included in the Thermo Scientific™ 
Compound Discoverer™ 30 software was used for final structure annotation of identified saponin class compounds More than 60 sapanins were 
annotated from the Sanqi extract The MSn data were critical for the identification of triterpenoid or spirostane aglycones
