### Broad Utilization of Natural Products (NPs) and Metabolomics

Natural products (NPs) have a wide range of applications in medicine, pharmacology, biology, nutrition, agriculture, cosmetics, biotechnology, food chemistry, environmental chemistry, and botany, among others. In recent years, the discovery process for NPs has experienced a technological breakthrough, with new approaches that have altered traditional concepts and perceptions. One such approach, rapidly embraced by experts in the field, is metabolomics.

Metabolomics has been employed to study natural entities in a more holistic manner, finding multiple applications and uses. These include chemotaxonomic studies, safety and toxicity assessments, quality control, plant defense, exploration of physiological and biochemical effects under various environmental and stress conditions, and the investigation of the physiological development of different organisms and drug discovery. The integration and harmonization of metabolomics with traditional and contemporary methods effectively facilitate NP research. In this presentation, we will discuss specific examples of NP metabolomics in drug discovery, chemotaxonomy, and quality control of natural entities such as medicinal plants and foodstuffs.

### Metabolic Implications of Gut Health Disorders in Norwegian Farmed Salmons

**Presenting Author:** Violetta Aru, Department of Science, University of Copenhagen, Denmark  
**Co-Authors:** Bekzod Khakimov, Elvis Chikwati, Alexander Jaramillo Torres, Aleksei Krasnov, Trond Kortner, Paul Johan Midtlyng, Åshild Krogdahl, Søren Balling Engelsen

The "GutMatters" project, funded by the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF), aims to define the prevalence and incidence of gut health disorders in farmed Atlantic salmon. The project involved sampling 360 salmons from six farm sites along the Norwegian coast over a one-year period, with three time points. Histopathological analysis of gut samples revealed inflammatory changes predominantly in the distal intestine but also in the entire intestinal tract in fish with chronic cestode parasitosis. Enterocyte steatosis was observed in the pyloric caeca of individuals collected from most farm sites.

High-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) 1H-NMR spectroscopy was used for the first time to analyze intact fecal samples from the pyloric caeca and distal intestine of Atlantic salmon. The samples were measured on a 400 MHz spectrometer. Metabolomic analysis showed a similar metabolic composition for samples from both intestinal regions. Amino acids (e.g., alanine, methionine, and phenylalanine), organic acids (e.g., lactic acid), and sugars were the main components of the fecal metabolome. Significant alterations in the lipid composition of the fecal samples were observed, attributed to dyslipidemia and gut inflammation.

### Exploring the Adaptation of Rainbow Trout Metabolome to Novel Aquafeeds

**Presenting Author:** Simon Roques, INRA, Univ. Pau & Pays Adour, E2S UPPA, UMR 1419 Nutrition Métabolisme et Aquaculture, France  
**Co-Authors:** Catherine Deborde, Nadège Richard, Sandrine Skiba-Cassy, Annick Moing, Benoit Fauconneau

The aquaculture industry faces the challenge of limited marine resources for feeding farmed fish. The development of plant-based diets alleviates this bottleneck, but carnivorous fish like rainbow trout do not tolerate diets based solely on plant ingredients. Our objective was to explore the responses of rainbow trout to plant-based diets complemented with alternative raw materials such as insects, microalgae, yeast, or processed animal proteins.

Metabolites were profiled in fish tissues and biofluids using NMR. We also analyzed the composition of alternative raw materials to identify compounds that could influence fish metabolism. Three key results illustrate the relevance of metabolomics in fish nutrition:
1. Histidine, an essential amino acid, was negatively correlated in muscle and plasma with the specific growth rate, regardless of the diet. In fish, histidine acts as a protective buffer agent, preventing the decrease of glycolytic flux during anaerobic processes.
2. Betaine, glycine, and serine signals were modified in the muscle of fish fed a plant-based diet compared to a commercial one, suggesting alterations in one-carbon metabolism or accumulation from raw material compounds.
3. A quinone compound specific to microalgae was detected in the liver of fish fed microalgae, indicating its potential as a biomarker for dietary incorporation.

### Metabolomics, Mixture Models, and Maggots: Solutions to Agricultural Waste Problems and Food Security

**Presenting Author:** Elizabeth Dickinson, University of York, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** Mark Harrison, Marc Parker, Michael Dickinson, Guy Beavis, James Donarski, Maureen Wakefield, Rosie Nolan, Aida Rafat, Jason Hallet, Adrian Charlton, Julie Wilson

Food security is a global challenge, and industrial waste biomass is a major environmental problem. Palm oil waste is currently burned for disposal, but solutions are needed to reduce the environmental impact of this industry. Palm waste can be recycled into biogas, but our goal was to optimize conditions for recycling it into a nutritious substrate for farmed insects. Fly larvae, a natural component of the diet of farmed animals like fish, chickens, and pigs, could meet the increasing demand for protein in animal feed and can be grown on plant waste.

Palm waste is tough and requires microbial breakdown (anaerobic digestion) to provide a substrate for larvae and produce methane gas, a sustainable energy source. However, digestion processes need adjustments and optimization. NMR spectroscopy and LC-HRMS were used to analyze palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) after various pre-processing methods and after anaerobic digestion. Biogas production was also measured. Statistical pattern recognition techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), were used to investigate compositional differences before and after digestion. Partial least squares regression (PLS-R) was used to develop models predicting biogas production. Digested EFB were submitted for preliminary insect feeding trials, and various domestic waste biomass was tested for larvae feeding trials and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Statistical models are being developed to determine the best mixture of these waste streams to produce the most nutritious substrate for larvae, providing an energy-neutral starting point for optimal insect rearing.

### Unraveling the Flavour of White Asparagus Using Metabolomics

**Presenting Author:** Eirini Pegiou, MSc., Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Roland Mumm, Robert Hall

Metabolomics has broad applications in plant and food analysis, including variety differentiation, identification and monitoring of biomarkers for food quality, and assessment of improved food products. Food processing often negatively impacts food quality attributes, such as flavor. Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is valued for its nutrients and characteristic flavor. Currently, more than 30% of the harvested product is discarded as waste due to the harvesting process and strict market requirements. This waste material could be useful for producing asparagus powder for use in soups and sauces. However, current drying techniques do not retain the characteristic asparagus flavor well, necessitating the addition of artificial supplements.

In this project, we aim to evaluate the flavor profile of processed white asparagus materials compared to fresh white asparagus. By analyzing products from different drying processes, we aim to define the optimal conditions that maintain maximum flavor. We use targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches, including GC-MS, to evaluate asparagus aroma. Results reveal the complexity of the biochemical composition of fresh and cooked asparagus and how it is modified during processing. Interpreting the effect of different drying strategies on asparagus aroma helps us define an optimal drying process while considering food naturalness. The outcome of this project will enable the conversion of current crop waste materials into high-value, high-quality dried food components.

### The Livestock Metabolome Database: Enabling Livestock Metabolomics Research

**Presenting Author:** Seyed Ali Goldansaz, University of Alberta, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Susan Markus, Mark Berjanskii, Rupasri Mandal, Yan Meng, Hamed Pirimoghadam, Debjani Bhattacharyya Chowdhury, Ying Dong, Jiamin Zheng, Paul Luimes, Zhiquan Wang, Graham Plastow, David Wishart

The application of metabolomics to livestock research lags behind other fields. To facilitate livestock metabolomics, we have created the Livestock Metabolome Database (LMDB; www.lmdb.ca), a freely accessible online database containing comprehensive metabolomic data for five common livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and pigs). The LMDB currently holds 1,070 metabolites extracted from existing literature and experimental data from cow and sheep metabolomes.

Our sheep metabolomic work focuses on profiling the blood metabolome of healthy sheep to predict economically important production traits, including feed efficiency, carcass merit, pregnancy, and litter size. Initial analyses for feed efficiency (n=250) using NMR, ICP-MS, and DI/LC-MS/MS identified and quantified 191 serum/blood metabolites. A panel of five candidate biomarkers (AUC>0.7) distinguished between lambs with high and low feed efficiency. In a second study, 158 serum metabolites were identified and quantified from pregnant sheep (n=500), with three candidate biomarkers (AUC=0.95) differentiating pregnant from non-pregnant ewes 35 days into gestation. We also identified a different pattern in the serum metabolome between pregnant ewes carrying a single fetus versus those carrying multiples. These results are being validated using additional serum samples (n=900). These projects will expand the LMDB and help develop a "pen-side" metabolomic test to facilitate farm management practices and animal selection.

### Change of Volatile Metabolites in Strawberries Spoiled by Fungi During Decay

**Presenting Author:** Su-Yeon Na, Ewha Womans University, South Korea

Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) is a major fruit cultivated worldwide but is highly susceptible to spoilage during shipping and storage, primarily due to food-borne pathogens. In this study, Cladosporium cladosporioides, a known pathogen of strawberries, was isolated from infected strawberries and inoculated onto disease-free strawberry fruits. The decay of strawberries was measured every 12 hours for 3.5 days. Volatile metabolites produced by fungi grown on strawberries were analyzed and compared during decay periods using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

Significantly reduced volatile metabolites included 3-ethylbenzaldehyde, xylene, propan-2-yl butanoate, hex-2-enyl acetate, ethyl octanoate, and propan-2-yl acetate. Conversely, 2-methylbutan-1-ol, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, methyl 2-methylbutanoate, methyl (Z)-N-hydroxybenzenecarboximidate, and caryophyllene increased over decay periods. Styrene, a well-known fungal volatile compound produced from phenylalanine, was produced at relatively high levels and significantly increased from 48 to 60 hours. Partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that strawberry samples corrupted by C. cladosporioides could be distinguished according to decay time. Major volatile metabolites related to decay were benzaldehyde, styrene, and 2-methylbutyl acetate.

### Non-Targeted Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomics Approach for Authentication of Organic Leaf Vegetables

**Presenting Author:** Ka Yi Man, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong

Vegetables are an important food source, providing essential nutrients, fiber, and bioactive phytochemicals. The global trend for consuming organic vegetables, such as tomatoes, potatoes, and leaf vegetables, has increased rapidly over the past few decades due to the rising demand for healthier and safer diets and concerns about environmental sustainability. Despite the high demand, a reliable method to verify whether plants are cultivated using organic practices is lacking. Non-targeted metabolomics can provide comprehensive information on the metabolite profiles to identify farming methods.

In this research, four types of common leaf vegetables in Hong Kong (n=124), including Amaranthus tricolor L. (red amaranth), Brassica rapa var. parachinensis (choy sum), Ipomoea aquatica Forsk. (water spinach), and Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce), were collected from accredited farms and certified organic farms. Non-targeted MS-based metabolomics analysis of aqueous and organic layers from liquid-liquid extraction revealed differences in the small molecule and lipid profiles of leaf vegetables. The results demonstrate that species and farming methods can be discriminated by a set of primary metabolites and plant lipids.

### Water Availability in the Soil and Its Effects on Tropane Alkaloid Metabolism in Datura stramonium

**Presenting Author:** Fredd Vergara, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, iDiv, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Abigail Moreno-Pedraza, Gabriel Jennifer

Datura stramonium is an annual plant that produces tropane alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine, which are non-selective muscarinic acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. These alkaloids affect the central nervous system in animals and act as chemical defenses against herbivores. Atropine and scopolamine contain nitrogen, and there is no evidence that D. stramonium establishes symbiosis with nitrogen (N2) fixing bacteria. Therefore, D. stramonium obtains nitrogen (NO3-) from the soil, and the assimilation of NO3- requires water. It is foreseeable that water availability in the soil influences the assimilability of NO3- by the roots of D. stramonium, which in turn affects tropane alkaloid biosynthesis.

To test this hypothesis, we set up an experiment with different irrigation levels. Tensiometers were used to quantify soil water pressure. Different organs of D. stramonium grown under different irrigations were analyzed using a non-targeted metabolomics approach (LC-qToF). We also determined the percentages of elemental carbon and nitrogen in different organs and performed absolute quantitation of atropine and scopolamine (LC-QqQ). We identified irrigations correlated with maximum tropane alkaloid production. These findings are relevant for understanding herbivory patterns in nature.

### Effects of Climate Conditions Around Harvest Days on Metabolites in Harvested Edamame

**Presenting Author:** Akira Oikawa, Yamagata University, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Yamato Horibe, Kei Morita, Katsutaka Takeuchi, Yasutaka Shimizu, Ryosuke Sasaki, Kazuki Saito, Hideki Murayama

The quality of agricultural products is affected by long-term climate changes such as drought and high temperature. Local and short-term climate conditions also impact the ingredients in agricultural products. This study focuses on the relationship between metabolite changes in edamame (green soybean) and the climate conditions around harvest days. Edamame was harvested daily over about 10 days for six years in the same field. Ionic metabolites and neutral sugars in the harvested edamame were comprehensively analyzed using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), respectively. Climate conditions around harvest days were recorded daily.

Correlation analysis between the edamame metabolome and climate conditions revealed that the amounts of some metabolites in edamame changed depending on the temperature and day length around the harvest days. Specifically, the amount of lysine in the harvested edamame and the integrated temperature for five days before harvest were significantly correlated. The amount of sucrose showed weak correlation with the length of daylight. Although not significant, the temperature at the harvest day tended to correlate positively or negatively with the amounts of several metabolites. These results show clear relationships between the climate around the harvest day and the quality of the harvested edamame, potentially adding value to agricultural products from a new perspective.

### A Fast LC-QqQ-MS/MS Method for the Quantification of Phytohormones in Stems of Forest Tree Species

**Presenting Author:** Ana Margarida Rodrigues, ITQB NOVA, Portugal  
**Co-Authors:** Swen Langer, Ed Bergström, David Harvey, Tony Larson, Jane Thomas-Oates, Carla António

Phytohormones are key low-abundant metabolites with critical signaling roles in mediating plant growth, development, adaptation to adverse environmental conditions, and defense responses. They belong to different classes based on their chemical structure and are present at very low concentrations in plants, making them challenging to quantify accurately. Continuous improvements in sensitive analytical techniques are needed to quantify several phytohormones in a single run and in different plant tissues. Most published analytical methods for quantitative analysis of phytohormones have been validated for Arabidopsis or crop species, with few optimized for complex matrices like forest tree species.

This study aimed to validate a simple, fast, and sensitive analytical method for the quantitative analysis of 14 phytohormones, belonging to six major classes, in the complex matrix of Pinus pinaster Ait. stem tissues, using the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer LC-MS system (LC-QqQ-MS/MS). This method is fast, reliable, and sensitive, allowing the quantification of 14 phytohormones in a single run (6.6 min). Key analytical validation steps include establishing calibration curves and assay linearity, assessing matrix effects on metabolite quantification, determining the limit of detection and limit of quantification, assessing analytical recoveries during metabolite extraction, and determining the precision of the method.

**Presenting Author:** Sung-Dug Oh, Rural Development Administration, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Ancheol Chang, Sang Jae Suh, Soo-Yun Park

Metabolomics is a useful tool for determining phenotypic variation in plants. This study aimed to identify primary and bioactive secondary metabolites from seeds of wild soybean (Glycine soja) and a Korean commercial cultivar (Glycine max, cv. Gwangan) and to explore metabolic differences between their genotypes. We profiled abundant hydrophilic primary metabolites and lipophilic secondary metabolites using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS). Data were subjected to multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and hierarchical clustering analysis, to determine phenotypic variation and relationships between metabolite contents.

GC-TOFMS analysis allowed clear discrimination between soybean genotypes. This study determined comprehensive metabolic differences between soybean seeds with different genotypes and provides useful information for genetic manipulation of soybean to influence primary and secondary metabolism.

### A GC-MS Platform for Assessing the Diversity of Fruit and Leaf Volatiles

**Presenting Author:** José L. Rambla, Jaume I University, Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Aurelio Gómez-Cadenas, Antonio Granell

Volatile compounds are important molecules in plants, involved in several independent processes. Fruit volatiles play a role in attracting seed dispersers and are key compounds in human perception of fruit flavor. Vegetative tissues also modify their volatile emission patterns in response to external factors such as the presence of insects and microorganisms, using them for communication with other plant organs, other plants, and living organisms like insects.

We present results from our platform for determining plant volatiles based on capture by Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) and separation and detection by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). This platform was used to characterize volatile compounds in different fleshy fruit species, many of which impact fruit flavor, and enabled the identification of genome regions and genes involved in their biosynthesis. Additionally, a non-targeted approach identified volatile compounds involved in the response of vegetative tissues to microbial and pest attacks, shedding light on the mechanisms involved in plant defense.

### Storability and Variety-Specific Metabolite Profiles of European Onion Landraces

**Presenting Author:** Christoph Weinert, Max Rubner-Institut, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** C.H. Weinert, M. Häußler, M.L. Romo Pérez, B. Egert, M. A. Frechen, B. Trierweiler, C. Zörb, S.E. Kulling

Onions are among the most popular and economically important vegetables worldwide, containing a range of health-beneficial compounds. Under appropriate conditions, onions can be stored for up to nine months. Modern conventional farming heavily relies on hybrid varieties, which may lead to genetic erosion and a loss of biodiversity. The use of open-pollinated landraces and their further development through breeding may be a viable alternative, especially for organic farming.

In this trial, we examined the metabolite profiles of nine landraces and a commercial control variety (Sturon) in the fresh state and after cold storage for up to five months at 2-3°C and <60% relative air humidity. Quantitative basic analyses and an untargeted GC×GC–MS analysis were performed. More than 200 onion metabolites were relatively quantified. In the fresh state, nine varieties could be separated into three groups, mainly according to differences in sugar and amino acid profiles. The variety "Jaune des Cévennes" was characterized by remarkably low fructan levels and higher monosaccharide content. While this variety suffered from increasing Botrytis and Aspergillus infestations after two months of cold storage, all other varieties demonstrated minimal water loss and no visual degradation even after five months. Storage led to increased levels of glutamine, glutamate, asparagine, phenylalanine, serine, several sulfur-containing amino acids, fructose, sucrose, xylose, trehalose, raffinose, myo-inositol, phosphate, malate, and a substantial decrease in citrate, nystose, and other di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides.

### Increased Throughput and Coverage for the Annotation of Saponins Using a Structure-Based MSn Approach on a Tribrid Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer

**Presenting Author:** Reiko Kiyonami, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Caroline Ding, Seema Sharma, Andreas Huhmer

Saponins are major components of Chinese medicines and exert various pharmacological effects, such as cardiovascular protection and anticancer activity. They can also reduce the side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Comprehensive annotation of saponins from various Chinese medicines remains challenging due to the limited availability of authentic standards and the structural diversity of this class of compounds.

Taking advantage of high-resolution MS and MSn capabilities offered by the tribrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer, we developed a product ion-dependent MSn data acquisition method. MS2 data is constantly collected, and higher-order FTMSn is performed if sugar neutral losses are detected from the MS2 data. The collected MSn tree data were used to identify saponin class compounds containing triterpenoid or spirostane aglycones. Chemspider and custom databases were used for final saponin structure annotation. As proof of concept, 80% methanol extracts from Sanqi, a Chinese medicine, were analyzed. A Thermo Scientific™ Orbitrap ID-X™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer was used to collect HRAM MS and MSn (up to MS4) data. The MSn data were searched against the msCloud spectral library using Thermo Scientific™ Mass Frontier™ 8.0 software for identifying saponin class compounds. The novel structure ranking tools in Thermo Scientific™ Compound Discoverer™ 3.0 software were used for final structure annotation. More than 60 saponins were annotated from the Sanqi extract, and the MSn data were critical for identifying triterpenoid or spirostane aglycones.
