Question: "In a supported Android device running Android 9 or higher, an application leverages the Android Protected Confirmation feature for a high-assurance financial transaction. Which of the following best describes the sequence and interaction of components involved in this process?"
 "A": "The app calls ConfirmationUI to generate a confirmation token, which is then used by Trusted UI to query the user for confirmation, and Keymaster asserts the userâ€™s approval."
 "B": "The app invokes Protected Confirmation, which then calls Trusted UI to query the user. Upon user's approval, Keymaster works with ConfirmationUI to generate a cryptographic statement."
 "C": "The app directly interacts with Keymaster to assert the user's approval without the need for Trusted UI or the generation of confirmation tokens."
 "D": "The app utilizes Trusted UI to directly encrypt the transaction data, bypassing the need for Keymaster or ConfirmationUI in the process."
Answer: B
