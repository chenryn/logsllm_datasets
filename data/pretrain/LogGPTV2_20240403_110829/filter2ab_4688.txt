### Title: ZombieLoad: Leaking Data on Intel CPUs at Black Hat Asia 2020

**Abstract:**

In January 2018, the publication of Meltdown marked the first instance of a hardware vulnerability that compromised the security guarantees of modern CPUs. Meltdown allowed attackers to leak arbitrary memory by exploiting the fact that Intel CPUs use lazy fault handling and continue transient execution with data from faulting loads. With the implementation of stronger kernel isolation, software workarounds to prevent Meltdown attacks, and the release of new CPUs with this vulnerability fixed, it seemed that Meltdown had been resolved.

However, in this talk, we demonstrate that Meltdown remains a significant issue on modern CPUs. We introduce ZombieLoad, a Meltdown-type attack that can leak data across multiple privilege boundaries, including processes, the kernel, SGX, hyperthreads, and even virtual machines. We also compare ZombieLoad to other microarchitectural data-sampling attacks, such as Fallout and RIDL, and show that existing Meltdown mitigations do not protect against ZombieLoad.

ZombieLoad can be executed without any user interaction from an unprivileged application, both on Linux and Windows. To illustrate the severity of the ZombieLoad attack, we present several scenarios, including monitoring browsing behavior, stealing cryptographic keys, and leaking the root-password hash on Linux. In a live demonstration, we will show that these attacks are not only feasible but also relatively easy to execute.

We will then discuss potential mitigations against the ZombieLoad attack and outline the challenges for future research on Meltdown attacks and their countermeasures. Finally, we will explore the short-term and long-term implications of Meltdown for hardware vendors, software vendors, and end-users.
