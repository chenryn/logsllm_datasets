### Depth Analysis
- The depth was increased, and the maximum depth was set to four for the following experiments.

### Keyword Selection for Lure Elements
- **Method**:
  - Manually browsed landing pages (e.g., game download, movie streaming, and torrent sites).
  - Clicked on various HTML elements and navigated intermediate pages.
  - Gathered 1,447 lure elements from 978 web pages leading to SE attacks.
  - Confirmed SE attacks using URL/domain blacklists (Google Safe Browsing, Symantec DeepSight [31], and hpHosts [4]).
  - Checked MD5 hash values of downloaded binaries with VirusTotal.
  - Defined SE pages as those matching the blacklist or starting malware/PUP downloads.
  - Randomly selected 5,000 non-lure elements that did not redirect to SE pages.
  - Created documents for lure and non-lure elements, calculated tf-idf, and chose 31 specific keywords.

### Effectiveness of URL Collection
- **Validation**:
  - Used the web-crawling module to recursively crawl landing pages and identify SE attacks.
  - Compared the number of collected landing pages leading to SE attacks across five methods: search engine, social media, Alexa top sites, trend words, and core keywords.
  - Collected 5,000 landing pages for each method.

### Search Engine (StraySheep's Method)
- **Process**:
  - Collected 3,000 core keywords from EC/database sites.
  - Generated 90,000 search queries by concatenating core keywords with 30 predefined qualifiers.
  - Searched using Microsoft Bing Web Search API, collecting 1 million unique URLs.
  - Sampled 5,000 URLs for crawling.

### Social Media (StraySheep's Method)
- **Process**:
  - Searched seven social-media platforms using the same search queries.
  - Extracted links from posting messages and video descriptions.
  - Found 130,000 unique social-media postings and 45,000 unique links.
  - Sampled 5,000 URLs for crawling.

### Baseline Methods
- **Alexa Top Sites**:
  - Gathered top 5,000 domain names and converted them to URLs.
- **Trend Words**:
  - Searched top 1,000 trend words using Bing API, sampled 5,000 URLs from 30,000 search results.
- **Core Keywords**:
  - Searched 3,000 core keywords in Bing API, sampled 5,000 URLs from 90,000 search results.

### Table 3: Results for Each Web-Crawling Module

| Module | # Total Pages | # Unique Visited Pages | # Unique Visited Domains | # Unique Visited SE Pages | # Unique SE Page Domains |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| StraySheep | 173,060 | 562,708 | 540,822 | 9,374 (5.4%) | 6,283 (8.5%) |
| ElementCrawler | 73,906 | 180,920 | 5,445 (3.0%) | 513 (6.7%) | 9,734 |
| LinkCrawler | 7,660 | 191,901 | 437 (3.2%) | 13,545 | 335 (3.4%) |

### Efficiency of Web Crawling
- **Comparison**:
  - Evaluated the efficiency of StraySheep's web-crawling module against two baseline modules: ElementCrawler and LinkCrawler.
  - Input 10,000 landing pages (5,000 from search engine and 5,000 from social media).
  - StraySheep's module had the best percentage (5.4%) for all SE pages, visiting more SE pages in less time.

### CDF of Time Taken to Complete Web Crawling
- **Results**:
  - 88.5% of StraySheep's web crawling finished within one-hour timeout.
  - Average time to complete web crawling: 14 minutes for StraySheep, 49 minutes for ElementCrawler, and 47 minutes for LinkCrawler.
