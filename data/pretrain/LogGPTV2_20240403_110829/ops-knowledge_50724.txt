User: can anybody give me advice how i process a BMP file so 
that i can check if a logo is present in that file?
E.g. I have a Foto.  My logo is supplied in another 
bmp file. I want to check if my logo is part of that
foto, if it is visible.
Bonus question: My logo can have transparencies in it. 
Does that change anything?
Assistant: Bonus answer: if you what the logo with a transparent background let say no background use a .png or .gif file, if you want 20% transparencies u can use CSS Image Opacity / Transparency or save you logo as a png with a transparent filter you can do this in adobe fireworks
