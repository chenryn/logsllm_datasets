bandwidth), requesters can choose a bandwidth class above
the proportional ratio. In the spirit of fair allocation of joint
resources, the lifetime of ephemeral paths is limited to 16
seconds in order to curtail the time of resource over-allocation.
The details of the over-allocation, however, are out of scope
and left for future work.
Ephemeral paths from steady paths. Ephemeral path re-
quests bear many similarities with steady path requests, yet
bootstrapping is different: An ephemeral path reservation is
launched by an end host, as opposed to a steady path reser-
vation that is launched by a leaf AS. The end host (e.g., host
S in Figure 1) ﬁrst obtains a steady up-path starting at its AS
(e.g., ASE) to the ISD core, and a steady down-path starting at
the destination ISD core (e.g., ASB2) to the destination leaf AS
(e.g., ASH). Joining these steady paths with an inter-ISD core
path (e.g., from ASA2 to ASB2) results in an end-to-end path
P, which is used to send the ephemeral path request from the
source end host S to the destination end host D using allocated
steady bandwidth.
More speciﬁcally, S ﬁrst generates a new ﬂow ID, chooses
an amount of bandwidth to request from SIBRA’s predeﬁned
ephemeral bandwidth classes, and sends the ephemeral path
request along path P.5 Recall that the path is composed of a
steady up-path of S, a core path, and a steady down-path of
D. The leaf AS where the source end host resides (e.g., ASE)
may decide to block the request in some cases, for instance
if the bandwidth purchased by the leaf AS is insufﬁcient.
Each intermediate AS on path P performs admission control
through a weighted fair sharing mechanism that ensures the
ephemeral bandwidth is directly proportional with its steady
path bandwidth, as described next. The bandwidth reservation
continues similarly to the steady path case.
If bots infest source and destination leaf ASes, these bots
may try to exceed their fair share by requesting, respectively
approving, excessively large amounts of bandwidth. To thwart
5Similarly to the steady path case, although an ephemeral path is identiﬁed
by a ﬂow ID, this ﬂow ID is orthogonal to TCP ﬂow IDs. A single ephemeral
path can transport any data packets regardless of their layer-4 protocol.
this attack, each leaf AS is responsible for splitting its pur-
chased bandwidth among its end hosts according to its local
policy, and for subsequently monitoring the usage.
Efﬁcient weighted bandwidth fair sharing. The intuition
behind SIBRA’s weighted fair sharing for ephemeral band-
width is that purchasing steady bandwidth (or generally spo-
ken: bandwidth for control trafﬁc) on a link L guarantees a
proportional amount of ephemeral bandwidth on L. In Figure 1,
the ephemeral bandwidth on the ephemeral path from end host
S to D is proportional to the steady bandwidth on the steady
up-path from ASE to core ASA2, and also proportional to the
steady bandwidth on the steady down-path from core ASB2
down to ASH. We explain the details of the three cases of intra-
source-ISD links, core links, and intra-destination-ISD links in
the following.
(1) Ephemeral bandwidth in the source ISD. For instance,
a steady up-path of 500 kbps traversing intra-ISD link L guar-
5 · 500 kbps of ephemeral bandwidth on L. Note that
antees 80

5 = 16 is the ratio between ephemeral and steady bandwidth
(Section III-A). Generally speaking, a steady up-path Su with
steady bandwidth sBWu traversing L can request ephemeral
bandwidth of
eBWu = 16· sBWu
(1)
Consequently, an AS that purchases a steady up-path Su
can guarantee its customers a ﬁxed amount of ephemeral
bandwidth for customers’ ephemeral path requests launched
via Su, regardless of the ephemeral path requests from other
ASes on L.
To provide bandwidth guarantees on every link to a desti-
nation, SIBRA extends the inﬂuence of the purchased steady
up-path bandwidth along the path to the destination AS. In fact,
SIBRA’s weighted fair sharing for ephemeral bandwidth on
core paths includes the purchased steady up-path bandwidth,
as explained in the following.
(2) Ephemeral bandwidth on core links. Let sBWS be the
total amount of steady bandwidth sold by a core ASS for all
steady paths in ASS’s ISD. Let sBWu be the reserved bandwidth
sold for a particular steady up-path Su in this ISD. Let further
sBWC be the control trafﬁc bandwidth of a core path C between
the core ASes of the steady paths for S and D. Then, ephemeral
reservations on C launched via Su can be up to
eBWuC =
sBWu
sBWS
· 16· sBWC
(2)
In other words, the ephemeral bandwidth reservable on C
launched via steady path Su depends not only on the amount
of total ephemeral bandwidth on C, but also on Su’s steady
up-path bandwidth in relation to the total amount of steady
up-path bandwidth purchased in Su’s ISD.
(3) Ephemeral bandwidth in the destination ISD. In the
destination ISD, the weighted fair sharing is slightly more
complex, but follows the ideas of the previous cases:
the
weighting includes the steady bandwidth of all steady up-
paths and all steady down-paths, as well as the ratios of the
bandwidth of the core contracts. Before explaining the details,
we note that the reason for including also the steady down-
paths is to give the destination AS control over the minimum
amount of trafﬁc it receives along ephemeral paths.

More precisely, an ephemeral path launched over steady
up-path Su and steady down-path Sd with core path C in
between obtains ephemeral bandwidth

where CS→D is the bandwidth negotiated in the core contract
for C between the core ASes of S and D, and C∗→D is the total
amount of bandwidth negotiated in all core contracts between
any core AS and D’s core AS.
Equation 3 looks similar to Equation 2, with an additional
factor in the weighting that reﬂects the ratio of incoming trafﬁc
from other core ASes. Intuitively, this factor assures that trafﬁc
from every other core AS obtains its fair share based on the
bandwidth negotiated in the individual bilateral contracts.
Finally, the overall bandwidth for an ephemeral path be-
tween end hosts S and D launched over steady up-path Su reads
eBWuCd = min(eBWu,eBWuC,eBWud)
(4)
These equations compute the guaranteed bandwidth using
the envisioned long-term ratio of 5% steady trafﬁc, 80%
ephemeral trafﬁc, and 15% best-effort trafﬁc. Ideally, the ratio
should be adjustable by each AS, initially with an imbalance in
favor of best-effort during incremental deployment of SIBRA,
until the number of SIBRA subscribers increases. The overall
bandwidth eBWuCd that can be obtained during early deploy-
ment is the minimum of the individual ratios for each AS and
their link bandwidth. We discuss the choice of the ratio in
Section VIII-A and its adaption in terms of an incremental
deployment strategy in Section VI.
Fair sharing of steady paths. A challenging question is
whether a fair sharing mechanism is necessary for steady
bandwidth. A steady up-path is used solely by the AS that
requested it, and its use is monitored by the AS, which
splits the steady up-path bandwidth between its end hosts.
In contrast, steady down-paths need to be revealed to several
potential source ASes, either as private steady down-paths
(e.g., for a company’s internal services), or as public steady
down-paths (e.g., for public services). To prevent a botnet
residing in malicious source ASes from ﬂooding steady down-
paths, SIBRA uses a weighted fair sharing scheme similar to
ephemeral paths: each AS using a steady down-path obtains a
fair share proportional to its steady up-path, and its ISD’s core
path. We give the details of the scheme in Appendix A.
Efﬁcient bandwidth usage via statistical multiplexing. In-
ternet trafﬁc often exhibits a cyclical pattern, with alternating
levels of utilized bandwidth. In situations of low utilization,
ﬁxed allocations of bandwidth for steady and ephemeral paths
that are unused would result in a waste of bandwidth. SIBRA
reduces such bandwidth waste through statistical multiplexing,
i.e., unused steady and ephemeral bandwidth is temporarily
given to best-effort ﬂows. A small slack of unallocated steady
and ephemeral bandwidth still remains to accommodate new
steady and ephemeral bandwidth requests. As more and more
entities demand steady paths and their fair share of ephemeral
paths, SIBRA gradually squeezes best-effort ﬂows and releases
the borrowed steady and ephemeral bandwidth up to the default
allocations.
Fig. 6: Per-neighbor monitoring may label benign AS1 malicious.
Renewal. End hosts can launch ephemeral path renewals to
increase the reserved bandwidth and extend the expiration
time of the ephemeral path. Since ephemeral reservations
have a short lifetime, they are frequently renewed. Renewals
are launched using the old reservation which contains the
bandwidth class of the reservation;
therefore routers can
rapidly decide on the fastpath how much bandwidth they
should allocate for the renewal, for instance if the bandwidth
increased, decreased, or remained the same. Reservations are
given a reservation index, incremented for each renewal of a
speciﬁc ephemeral path. Reservations can be renewed anytime
before they expire, and the end host is allowed to switch to
the newer reservation at any time. However, the end host is
not allowed to use both the old and the renewed reservation
at the same time; Section III-F shows a mechanism to detect
such misbehavior.
E. Priority trafﬁc monitoring and policing
Flows that violate their reservations may undermine the guar-
antees of other legitimate ﬂows. An ideal monitoring algorithm
should immediately catch every such malicious ﬂow. This,
however, would be too expensive for line-rate trafﬁc in the
Internet core.
Instead, as the ﬁrst line of defense, SIBRA relies on edge
ASes to perform ﬁne-grained trafﬁc monitoring. Edge ASes
rely on ﬂow IDs to check each ﬂow’s bandwidth usage and
compare it against the reserved bandwidth for that ﬂow ID,
which is stored by each AS locally during the reservation
request. Previous research has shown that per-ﬂow slowpath
operations are feasible at the edge of the network [37].
Monitoring on transit ASes, however, needs to be processed
on the fastpath. To detect misbehaving ASes that purposely
fail to regulate their own trafﬁc, SIBRA deploys a lightweight
monitoring mechanism in transit ASes. First, each AS monitors
the bandwidth usage of incoming trafﬁc from each neighbor
AS and compares it against the total bandwidth reserved for
that neighbor. Such coarse-grained monitoring timely detects a
misbehaving neighbor that failed to correctly police its trafﬁc.
Why per-neighbor monitoring is insufﬁcient. There are
cases, though, when per-neighbor monitoring in transit ASes is
insufﬁcient. Figure 6 depicts two ﬂows originating in AS0, each
having reserved 5 Mbps. Flow 1 is malicious and sends trafﬁc
with 8 Mbps, while ﬂow 2 underuses its reservation. AS0 hence
does not properly monitor its ﬂows. When AS1 performs per-
neighbor monitoring, it can only notice that, in the aggregate,
it receives 10 Mbps from AS0 and sends 10 Mbps to AS2.
However, when the two ﬂows diverge, AS2 detects ﬂow 1 as
malicious and holds AS1 responsible, although AS1 properly
performed per-neighbor monitoring.
For this reason, SIBRA additionally utilizes ﬁne-grained
probabilistic monitoring of individual ﬂows at the transit ASes,
using a a recently proposed technique [43]. Each transit AS
monitors, per given time interval, all the ﬂows in a number of
randomly chosen bandwidth classes. Recall that the bandwidth
7
class of a ﬂow is authenticated by the RTs in the packet header.
In case the average bandwidth utilization of a ﬂow during that
time interval exceeds the ﬂow’s bandwidth class, the ﬂow is
classiﬁed as malicious and added to a blacklist, preventing its
renewal.
We emphasize that transit ASes perform monitoring on the
fastpath. Only in case of suspicion of misbehavior, these ASes
perform out-of-band slowpath monitoring to police misbehav-
ing neighbors and ﬂows.
To localize the origin AS of the malicious ﬂow, an AS
informs the previous AS of the misbehaving ﬂow. In response,
the previous AS can simply monitor that speciﬁc ﬂow ex-
plicitly. If the violation persists, the suspicious previous-hop
neighbor is likely to be malicious. Then, the AS can punish
it, for instance, by terminating their contract.
F. Flow renewal monitoring and policing
A successful ephemeral path renewal replaces the old reserva-
tion, therefore the renewal receives the same ﬂow ID as the
old reservation. However, SIBRA paths allow for RTs with
overlapping validity periods. Therefore, if multiple renewals
occur before the ephemeral path expires, the source would be
in possession of multiple sets of valid RTs: Some correspond-
ing to the ephemeral path with the previous bandwidth class
and old expiration time, and the others corresponding to the
new values for bandwidth class and expiration time, along the
same path. Since all sets of RTs are associated with the same
ﬂow ID, routers would overwrite their per-ﬂow entries with
the new bandwidth class.
A malicious end host could thus exploit renewals by using
both sets of RTs, old and new, during the overlap time of the
RTs, thus using more bandwidth than the amount reserved. To
prevent such misuse, end hosts are not allowed to use old RTs
after having used the renewed RTs. When renewals use the
