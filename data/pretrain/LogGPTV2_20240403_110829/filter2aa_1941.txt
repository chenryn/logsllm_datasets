Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth 
Plagueis "the wise"? I thought not. It's not 
a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith 
legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of 
the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could 
use the Force to influence the 
midichlorians to create life... He had such 
a knowledge of the dark side that he could 
even keep the ones he cared about from 
dying. The dark side of the Force is a 
pathway to many abilities some consider 
to be unnatural.

Scanner soliloquy
● Scanners are mostly the same
● Most common (default) mode:
○
Act as HID keyboard
○
Type buffer key by key
● What could we do if we could
○
Change the text on the fly?
○
Send arbitrary keystrokes?
○
Win + R?
To scan, or not to scan...
What could we do?*
*with proper permission in the scope of a legal, sanctioned pentest
It's not a bug!™
● Some symbologies add control chars
● Code 128:
○
107 possible characters
○
 0 - 95: portions of ASCII
○
96-106: control chars
● Control chars trigger programming
● Majority of scanners support this
○
Manufacturer specific

Yes, it's in-band signaling
What can programming do?
● Exists for legacy systems
● "We use Cyberdyne to track 
and herd our cats."
● "It's too expensive to 
replace or modify."
● "Make it faster!"
● Real (fake) example
No, not THAT type of cat...

Programming is stupid simple
● Specify criteria
○
All barcodes (no criteria)
○
Barcodes that start with 9
○
Barcodes that contain "cat"
○
All UPC barcodes
● Specify actions when rule is triggered
● Can store multiple rules
○
Model-specific limits on size
"CatERP"
Actions we can do with rules
● Modify/replace text
● Ignore text
● Add extra characters
● Add special keys
○
Ctrl or Alt key combos
○
Windows/super key too!
● "Brick" scanners
○
Do nothing!

(finally)
● Payload design IDE
○
Payloads in JSON
○
Rapidly develop and test
● Abstracts most complexity
○
No deciphering manuals
● Supports Motorola Symbol
○
Send us scanners?
● Open source
Harder Than Ducky Script™
Demo
Can you turn it off?
Red team considerations
● Find beeper hole and cover it if possible
● Successful attacks take significant recon, planning
● BYOS - Bring Your Own Scanner
○
Detach scanner with screwdriver, plug your own in
● Even when systems are off, scanners may be powered
● Laser scanners will only work with paper or a Kindle
● Trick others into delivering barcodes
Let someone else do the dirty work
Blue team considerations
● No way to secure scanners from programming
○
Some models may not support it
● Assume scanners are hostile keyboards
○
Remove local admin
○
Use endpoint protection + app control
○
Limit PowerShell, cmd, run dialog, etc
● Filter malicious keys at OS-level
○
Or enforce non-HID modes
