Network Address Translation (NAT) solutions. This section quantiﬁes, for our
dataset, the prevelance of public IP address assignment, NAT solution, and other
middleboxes.
We observe 18,949 measurements, or roughly 70% of the measurements, where
the smartphone’s device interface is assigned a private IP address. Assignment of
an address from IANA’s reserved IP address space indicates the use of NAT so-
lutions between the user’s device and the application server. Further, we identify
478 instances where the phone’s cellular interface address is assigned a public
IP address but it does not match the observed IP address at the application
server, thus indicating the presence of middleboxes between the device and the
application server.
Table 3 illustrates the diversity of networks seen in our dataset. For each
measurement point, we determine the network operator by querying the WHOIS
service. The query uses the interface IP address if it is public or the observed
IP address if the interface is assigned a private IP address. The table ranks
networks based on the number of unique smartphones matched to a network. We
notice that most operators use some form of NAT. Further, among these top 15
networks, we ﬁnd several instances where a network assigns private IP addresses
to some devices and public IP addresses to other devices, indicating service
diﬀerentiation within operators: some devices beneﬁt from publicly routable IP
addresses, but most do not. We also ﬁnd a few instances where a smartphone is
assigned a private IP address at one point in time, and a public IP address at
another point in time.

4.2 Spatial Allocation of IP Blocks
We investigated the geographical span of devices belonging to the top /24 IP sub-
nets in the dataset. This indication can be useful when building GeoIP databases,
especially when longest preﬁx matching strategies are used. We identiﬁed the top
10 /24 subnets that account for the most measurements from unique devices,
and used Google’s reverse-geocoding service to lookup the country location for
each measurement in this set. Using a WHOIS service, we veriﬁed that all IPs in
each /24 subnet does indeed belong to the same network provider. Table 4 sum-
marizes our results, and illustrates that devices physically present in diﬀerent
countries may be assigned an address from the same IP block.
4.3 Spatial Coverage of Gateways
When a cellular network uses middleboxes, the application’s server will receive
connections from several distinct devices, all originating from a single IP address
(which we refer to as the mobile gateway IP address). Here, we study the spatial
dispersion of devices around mobile gateways, as observed in our dataset. This
has implications on the accuracy of GeoIP databases as multiple, potentially
far apart, devices have the same IP address from the point-of-view of Internet
servers.

Fig. 3. Geographical dispersion of mobile hosts around the top 100 gateways
Figure 2 illustrates the dispersion of hosts attached to some example mobile
gateway IP addresses4, for one country (Australia). It is interesting to note
that each gateway has hosts roughly in all major Australian cities. In addition,
we found one device in the Netherland with the observed IP of 203.20.35.d,
which is most likely a roaming user. Table 5 quantiﬁes the spatial diversity for
the top 10 gateways with hosts in more than one country, in our dataset. Our
dataset suggests that mobile networks allocate IP addresses at a country-level
granularity: mobile hosts exit the operator’s network through a few gateways
within the country, and these exit points may also be maintained while roaming.
We quantify the geographic spread of hosts served by a gateway by computing
the maximum distance between any two hosts that are connected to the Internet
through the same gateway. Figure 3 shows the histogram of the maximum dis-
persion values (in KM), for the top 100 gateways in our dataset. We notice that
there are three clusters: one at approximately 500km, one at about 1500 km,
and another at about 4000km. These clusters approximately correspond to the
average inter-city, inter-state, and inter-country or inter-continental distances in
our dataset. We also observed an outlier at 17,000km (not shown on the plot)
which correspond to an Australian user roaming in the Netherlands.

4.4 Accuracy of IP Geolocation Databases
We also tested the ability of GeoIP databases to return host location based on IP
addresses seen by the application’s server. For this analysis, we use two commer-
cial GeoIP databases, namely MaxMind [2] and IPinfoDB [1], and compute the
error as the distance between the geographical location returned by the GeoIP
database and our measurement location. As previously mentioned, application-
level measurements introduce sampling bias: as each measurement occurrence
depends on a user starting the application and the user’s current position, more
popular areas or areas where the service is more popular will have more mea-
surement points. To address this spatial sampling bias, we normalize the error
at the city scale, by computing the average error for each city (identiﬁed using
Google’s reverse geocoding service).
Figure 4 shows the distribution of the computed errors, for the GeoIP
databases considered, with results presented separately for public and private
IP addresses. (Note that for devices with private IPs we use their gateway ad-
dress as visible to the server on the Internet.) For our dataset, depending on
the database used, errors of 100km or more are observed in at least 70% of the
measurements although 90% of the errors are under 1000km. The errors are typ-
ically larger for devices assigned private IP addresses. This is not surprising as
we have previously noted that one mobile gateway could potentially cover an
entire country, including countries as large as Australia.
5 Concluding Remarks
We studied cellular data networks from the point-of-view of IP clients, cov-
ering both spatial and IP-layer aspects. Our work is based upon a compre-
hensive dataset of several thousand mobile device locations and IP addresses.
Our dataset suggests that mobile operators worldwide are using some form of

NAT or middlebox. This has implications for application designers (e.g., diﬃ-
culty of implementing peer-to-peer communication, performance implications).
As hosts behind NATs appear from a few IP addresses per country, we shown
how these IP addresses can cover hosts physically present in entire countries,
across international borders, and even continents. We also evaluated the accu-
racy of GeoIP database in the mobile domain, and found that, for our data, the
distance error between the GeoIP database determined location and the GPS de-
termined location is at least 100km for approximately 70% of our measurements,
with a few errors being substantially larger.
