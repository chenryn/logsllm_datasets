### Network Address Translation (NAT) Solutions and IP Address Assignment

This section quantifies the prevalence of public IP address assignment, NAT solutions, and other middleboxes in our dataset.

We observed 18,949 measurements, or approximately 70% of the total, where the smartphone's device interface was assigned a private IP address. The use of an address from IANA’s reserved IP address space indicates the presence of NAT solutions between the user’s device and the application server. Additionally, we identified 478 instances where the phone’s cellular interface was assigned a public IP address, but it did not match the observed IP address at the application server, suggesting the presence of middleboxes between the device and the application server.

### Table 3: Diversity of Networks in the Dataset

For each measurement point, we determined the network operator by querying the WHOIS service using either the interface IP address (if public) or the observed IP address (if the interface is assigned a private IP address). The table ranks networks based on the number of unique smartphones matched to each network. Our findings indicate that most operators use some form of NAT. Among the top 15 networks, we found several instances where a network assigns both private and public IP addresses to different devices, indicating service differentiation within operators. Some devices benefit from publicly routable IP addresses, while most do not. We also observed cases where a smartphone was assigned a private IP address at one point in time and a public IP address at another.

### 4.2 Spatial Allocation of IP Blocks

We investigated the geographical span of devices belonging to the top /24 IP subnets in the dataset. This information is useful for building GeoIP databases, especially when using longest prefix matching strategies. We identified the top 10 /24 subnets with the most measurements from unique devices and used Google’s reverse-geocoding service to determine the country location for each measurement. We verified that all IPs in each /24 subnet belong to the same network provider. Table 4 summarizes our results, illustrating that devices physically present in different countries may be assigned an address from the same IP block.

### 4.3 Spatial Coverage of Gateways

When a cellular network uses middleboxes, the application’s server will receive connections from multiple devices originating from a single IP address (referred to as the mobile gateway IP address). We studied the spatial dispersion of devices around mobile gateways, as observed in our dataset. This has implications for the accuracy of GeoIP databases, as multiple, potentially far-apart, devices share the same IP address from the perspective of Internet servers.

### Figure 2: Dispersion of Hosts Around Mobile Gateways

Figure 2 illustrates the dispersion of hosts attached to example mobile gateway IP addresses, focusing on one country (Australia). Each gateway has hosts in major Australian cities. Additionally, we found a device in the Netherlands with the observed IP of 203.20.35.d, likely a roaming user.

### Figure 3: Geographical Dispersion of Mobile Hosts

Table 5 quantifies the spatial diversity for the top 10 gateways with hosts in more than one country. Our dataset suggests that mobile networks allocate IP addresses at a country-level granularity. Mobile hosts exit the operator’s network through a few gateways within the country, and these exit points may be maintained while roaming. We computed the maximum distance between any two hosts connected to the Internet through the same gateway. Figure 3 shows the histogram of the maximum dispersion values (in kilometers) for the top 100 gateways. We observed three clusters: one at approximately 500 km, one at about 1500 km, and another at about 4000 km, corresponding to inter-city, inter-state, and inter-country or inter-continental distances. An outlier at 17,000 km corresponds to an Australian user roaming in the Netherlands.

### 4.4 Accuracy of IP Geolocation Databases

We tested the ability of GeoIP databases to return host locations based on IP addresses seen by the application’s server. We used two commercial GeoIP databases, MaxMind and IPinfoDB, and computed the error as the distance between the geographical location returned by the GeoIP database and our measurement location. To address spatial sampling bias, we normalized the error at the city scale by computing the average error for each city (identified using Google’s reverse geocoding service).

Figure 4 shows the distribution of computed errors, presented separately for public and private IP addresses. For our dataset, depending on the database used, errors of 100 km or more were observed in at least 70% of the measurements, although 90% of the errors were under 1000 km. Errors were typically larger for devices assigned private IP addresses, which is expected given that one mobile gateway can cover an entire country, including large countries like Australia.

### 5 Concluding Remarks

We studied cellular data networks from the perspective of IP clients, covering both spatial and IP-layer aspects. Our work is based on a comprehensive dataset of several thousand mobile device locations and IP addresses. Our findings suggest that mobile operators worldwide are using some form of NAT or middlebox, which has implications for application designers, such as difficulties in implementing peer-to-peer communication and performance issues. As hosts behind NATs appear from a few IP addresses per country, these IP addresses can cover hosts physically present in entire countries, across international borders, and even continents. We also evaluated the accuracy of GeoIP databases in the mobile domain and found that, for our data, the distance error between the GeoIP-determined location and the GPS-determined location is at least 100 km for approximately 70% of our measurements, with some errors being substantially larger.
