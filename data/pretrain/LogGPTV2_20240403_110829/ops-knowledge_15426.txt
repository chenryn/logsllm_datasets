User: How to determine whether a web application is under DDoS attack? Please provide a way to identify a DDoS attack.
Assistant: 1. Traffic analysis: Use network monitoring tools to analyze the traffic entering the web application. Unusually high traffic spikes are often a hallmark of a DDoS attack. 2. Network bandwidth consumption: DDoS attacks will consume a large amount of network bandwidth, making it impossible for normal users to access the site normally. If the bandwidth usage of the website has reached or exceeded the maximum limit, it may be attacked by DDoS. 3. Response time: DDoS attacks will lead to increased server load and longer response time. If you notice that your website's response time becomes very slow or unresponsive, you may be under attack. 4. Exception log: The log record of the application will record information such as access volume and request method. If you find abnormal traffic or request methods, such as high-frequency visits from an IP address, you need to be alert to DDoS attacks. 5. Self-diagnosis: web applications can use some tools to perform self-diagnosis. For example, you can use the CDN's anti-DDoS capability to conduct stress tests on yourself to check how much load the website can withstand. To sum up, DDoS attacks can be discovered and mitigated by monitoring traffic, bandwidth, and logs in real time, as well as implementing security precautions.
