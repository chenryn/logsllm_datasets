**Describe the bug**
Running "npx playwright codegen google.com" and doing no further actions will
stay up for around 1 minute each time and then crash the debugger and the test
browser window, I've done about 5 consecutive tests with a timer to check
this. I've asked colleagues (they have a basically same specced mac) to do the
same with the same results. I've noticed this issue while doing some initial
setup on our locally ran application, but to debug the issue further I tested
this on google.com and the behavior is the same.
Also noticed after checking other issue previously reported that using debug
mode on the tests also crashes after 1 minute.
All of this on chromium.
