### 3.7 Other Places Where to Look for Data

The list of locations where unwanted data may appear is extensive: comments, style sheets, hyperlinks to Intranet servers, and even parameters or variable names in VBScript macros. All this data can be easily retrieved using a hexadecimal editor or a string extraction program.

### 3.8 Hidden Metadata

So far, this section on Microsoft Office has focused on metadata and information that are easily accessible, and sometimes editable, by the user. However, there is another type of data stored within documents that is not visible to the user. This metadata is used by Microsoft Office for its internal tasks and can contain sensitive information such as software versions, authors, revision history, the last person who edited the document and when, the last time the document was printed, which printer was used, total editing time, information about email messages including email addresses, and, in some earlier versions of Office, a Global Unique ID (GUID) that identifies the computer on which the document was edited.

**Figure 35: Extracted document’s metadata using Libextractor**

### 3.9 Database Connections

The information stored in a particular file depends on the version of Microsoft Office used and the file format. If a document uses an external source, such as a database, additional information like database queries, ODBC drivers, the database server, and even passwords can be retrieved. The following image shows a SELECT query, configured ODBC drivers, the database server, the database itself, and the password.

**Figure 36: Database info**

In clear text, the information in Figure 36 is:
```sql
SELECT pruebas_0.apellidos, pruebas_0.nombre, pruebas_0.tlf FROM pruebasmetadata.pruebas pruebas_0
DATABASE=pruebasmetadata
DRIVER={MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver} OPTION=0
PWD=PassMETADATA
PORT=0 SERVER=servidor
UID=UsuarioMETADATA
```

A hexadecimal editor can be used to read this data from the document. As shown, this is a special document created to generate documents with parts that are populated from a database repository.

### 3.10 Printers

As previously mentioned, revision history provides information about user accounts and paths that may relate to server names and shared resources. Another piece of hidden, potentially compromising information found within documents is printer data.

**Figure 37: Information about printer**

Similar to ODF documents, the sensitivity of this information depends on how the printer is configured. If the printer is shared on a server, it can appear in UNC format, providing the server name, shared resource, and even the server's IP address, revealing details about the internal network.

Although this information is significant on its own, it also provides more context to a potential attacker. If the document's creator uses that printer, it indicates that the user has access to that resource, confirming that the user is a valid one on the server. This can lead to the discovery of information about the network's Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**Figure 38: Printer in UNC format**

Microsoft Office versions prior to Office 97 rarely include this information in document metadata. However, all versions update this information if it is found, changing it to the name of the currently used printer, even if the document is not printed. A simple edit and save operation is enough to update this data. Therefore, documents that have been used since the Office 97 era must be carefully inspected for printer data.

### 3.11 Document Analysis and Cleaning

It is essential to clean Microsoft Office documents before sending or publishing them, as they may contain large amounts of unwanted data. The "Inspect Document" option in Office 2007 is the ultimate tool for this task. It searches for all metadata and hidden information, including printer data and revision history, and allows the user to remove it all from the document. Regardless of the version of Microsoft Office used to create and edit the document, "Inspect Document" will clean it with just a few clicks.

**Figure 39: Preparing document in Microsoft Office 2007 (in Spanish)**

Previous versions of Microsoft Office did not provide this option. To address this, Microsoft released a plug-in called RHDTool to enhance the cleaning capabilities. This tool is available for download at:
- [RHDTool Download](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=144e54ed-d43e-42ca-bc7b-5446d34e5360)

**Figure 40: RHDTool**

Additionally, Microsoft has published guides to help users minimize the amount of metadata in their documents (refer to the References section for URLs). Third-party tools, such as Metadata Extractor or Doc Scrubble, are also available. However, it should be noted that these tools may not always clean all metadata and hidden information. For example, the following image shows that even after cleaning a document with DocScrubble, it still contains printer data.

**Figure 41: Printer info remains inside the file**

Converting Microsoft Office documents to other formats, such as PDF, has been suggested as a solution. However, PDF files also store information in the "Data Dictionary" and XMP streams, including user accounts, file paths, URLs pointing to Intranet servers, email message headers, operating system information, and more.

**Figure 42: PDF Metadata including Intranet references**

Even converting documents to TXT format may not be sufficient, as search engines like Google, MSN Search, or Yahoo can create new metadata based on the document content. This includes titles, abstracts, and cached versions, which can turn any lost data into metadata.

### 4. Metadata Extraction Tools

Several tools are available for extracting metadata from documents, depending on their format. Libextractor is one of the most well-known. It includes a library of functions to access document properties and a standalone program called "extract," which parses and extracts metadata from various file formats, including Microsoft Office documents, ODT, PDF, and more. It supports the extraction of revision history from DOC files, making it one of the few freely available tools for this task.

Metagoofil is a program that downloads documents from websites and then extracts metadata using the "extract" tool, simplifying the process of fingerprinting corporate networks.

Exiftool is another open-source metadata extraction tool. Initially designed to extract EXIF information from image files, it now supports a wide range of file formats, including Microsoft Office documents. When present, it can retrieve GUID information from older versions of Word files. Exiftool also handles PDF documents, extracting both Data Dictionary and XMP metadata. It has an option for deep scanning of XMP metadata, even if it is disassociated from the main tree structure of the PDF file. Both "extract" and Exiftool are command-line utilities.

There are also GUI-based tools for metadata extraction, such as ExifReader. However, these programs tend to be less flexible and powerful than their command-line counterparts.

Most of these tools focus on metadata and do not pay much attention to hidden information, except for "extract" and its revision history processing. Neither printer information, template paths, nor database information can be obtained by them. To address this, new tools are needed, which is why FOCA was created.

FOCA uses web search engines to locate documents, download them, and extract metadata and hidden information. It supports several file formats, including Microsoft Office documents, ODF, WordPerfect files, and more, and retrieves a wider range of information than any other tool mentioned here.

### 5. Search Engines

When a document is published on a corporate website, it becomes available to web search engines like Google, Live Search, or Yahoo. These search engines create new metadata about the document, including titles, abstracts, and cached versions. This metadata is generated based on the document's content, so any lost data in the document can become metadata. This is particularly problematic if the document does not contain a title or customized metadata to help search engines create a short description.

With a little Google Hacking, one can use searching options like "intitle" to retrieve compromising information without even downloading the documents. Organizations may not even notice that someone is accessing sensitive data.

**Figure 43: FBI.gov users gathered by Google**

This kind of data can also be found in documents created or edited on Linux and other Unix systems.

**Figure 44: *NIX users**

All this information becomes available to anyone with internet access and may remain available even after documents are modified or removed from the website due to the caching feature provided by most web search engines.

Cached copies of documents may be tagged with "Cache" or "HTML version" and are stored by the search engine systems themselves, giving little control to website owners and administrators over their contents and access rights. While search engine companies provide tools for webmasters to remove content from their indexes, these tools may be ineffective for managing large volumes of documents. Monitoring accesses through search engine caches is also a challenging task for organizations and website administrators.

### 6. FOCA

As a proof of concept, FOCA (Fingerprinting Organization with Collected Archives) has been developed. FOCA is an automated tool for downloading documents published on websites, extracting metadata, and analyzing data. It is an ongoing project that is continuously being improved.

FOCA uses Google and Microsoft Live Search engines to find links to documents. It does not require a special Google key to access the API, so if a CAPTCHA is required, FOCA will stop and wait for the user to input the CAPTCHA value.

**Figure 45: 1394 office documents published on the Blackhat website**

A large website can store between three and five thousand Office documents, so in a normal search, between zero and five CAPTCHAs may be required, depending on the security policies of Google and Microsoft at the time. After collecting all the links, FOCA uses a multi-threaded engine to download all the documents as quickly as possible.

**Figure 46: FOCA downloading files**

Once the documents are retrieved, FOCA can extract metadata from all of them. It currently supports DOC, XLS, PPT, PPS, DOCX, PPTX, PPSX, XLSX, SWX, ODT, ODS, ODP, PDF, and WPD documents. The following image shows the metadata extracted from a public document, in this case, a work by David Litchfield.

**Figure 47: Metadata stored in a Microsoft Doc published at Blackhat.com (in English)**

After analyzing all the documents, FOCA collects three special lists: discovered users, file paths, and printers. It also makes it easy to track where the metadata is stored for a deeper analysis of a real environment.

**Figure 48: Tracking Metadata in files**

FOCA also searches for new servers in the domain name system using Google Sets and Wikipedia categories based on the server names found. Finally, it provides a view that is more or less complete, depending on the amount of data obtained.

An online version of FOCA is available at:

### 7. Secure Web Publishing

Removing metadata from documents is not an easy task. As users cannot always be relied upon to ensure document security, and the volume of published information continues to increase, organizations must find ways to automate this process. Among the systems involved in document security, web servers play a fundamental role as the logical boundary between the internet and the organization. MetaShield Protector is a solution for sanitizing documents on the fly as they are served to users by IIS web servers. It replaces document metadata to contribute to security and offer a normalized public image of the organization.

---

### Conclusions

Any document can have associated metadata containing lost information or hidden data. Microsoft Office and OpenOffice documents, in particular, may contain data about the internal network, user accounts, machines, shared resources, services, operating systems, and more. Organizations must consider this information before publishing documents on the web or sending them via email. Cleaning these documents is crucial, as is taking care of how web search engines index them. Always be mindful of the information you publish and the information that may be inadvertently disclosed.
