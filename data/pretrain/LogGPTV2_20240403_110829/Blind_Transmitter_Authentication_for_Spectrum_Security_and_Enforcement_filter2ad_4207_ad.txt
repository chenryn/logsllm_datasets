the error performance of the message signal at Bob. More-
over, no signiﬁcant overhead is incurred at Bob to use those
frequency estimates to estimate the authentication signal.
In ATM, no signiﬁcant computational overhead is needed
to embed authentication at Alice along with no power and
message throughput overheads. Bob using its pilot symbols
can estimate and remove the phase oﬀset and hence, there
is no eﬀect on the error performance of the message signal
at Bob. In Gelato, the computation overhead to embed the
authentication signal at Alice is non-signiﬁcant. However,
since Na out of Nu useful sub-carriers are loaded with re-
dundant data samples, the message data-rate is reduced by
· 100 %. For instance, with Na = 6 and Nu = 48, Alice
Na
Nu
loses 12.5% of its data-rate. Although Bob does not suﬀer
in terms of the error performance of the message signal, the
message decoding procedure needs to be modiﬁed to discard
the data samples at the redundant sub-carriers.
Transparency: In the existing standards describing PHY-
layer speciﬁcations, there is a signiﬁcant margin allowed for
the carrier frequency oﬀset (CFO) in the message signals
due to inaccurate oscillators at the transmitters and the re-
ceivers. For instance, as per IEEE 802.11g [2], the absolute
value of CFO due to an inaccurate oscillator should be less

than 25 ppm of the carrier frequency. This means that for
transmitted signals at 2.4 GHz, a frequency oﬀset of ±60
kHz is allowed. Also, the preamble structure (inserted in
each frame) ensures that a frequency oﬀset of 2 · 60 kHz
= 120 kHz (considering the margin for the oscillator at re-
ceiver) can be tolerated by each frame of the message signal.
In FEAT, Charlie utilizes the preamble symbols added at
the beginning of each frame, and the pilot samples in each
symbol of the message signal to estimate and remove the fre-
quency oﬀset. Hence, there is no eﬀect on the error perfor-
mance of the message signal at Charlie. In ATM, the phase
oﬀset can be estimated using the pilot symbols and hence
there is no eﬀect on the error performance of the message
signal at Charlie.
In Gelato, Charlie can demodulate the
message signal, but the demodulated signal would not make
sense for Charlie since it being the unaware of the presence
of the authentication scheme does not know the presence
of the repetition of QAM message samples on some of the
sub-carriers. Hence, unlike FEAT and ATM, Gelato is not
transparent with the unaware receiver.
Authentication Rate: By design, in FEAT, ATM as
well as Gelato, one bit of authentication signal is embedded
into each frame of the message signal. Hence, the authenti-
cation rate is equal to the frame rate of the message signal.
Robustness to Noise and Fading: We simulate FEAT,
ATM and Gelato using Matlab to estimate their error perfor-
mance at diﬀerent SNR. With AWGN channel, FEAT per-
forms signiﬁcantly better than ATM and Gelato as shown
in Figure 7a. For instance, at SNR of −6 dB, the BER
in FEAT is 0.003 as compared to 0.2 in Gelato, and 0.3
in ATM. We also present the error performance of the au-
thentication signal in a Rayleigh fading channel with 200
Hz doppler shift in Figure 7b. Recall that since Dave does
not have the information of the pilot signals used by Alice,
it is not possible for it to counter the channel eﬀects gen-
erated due to multipath. Hence, in Figure 7b, we observe
that the BER in ATM is close to 0.5. However, even in
these channel conditions, FEAT achieves suﬃcient BER so
that the authentication sequence can be recovered using the
error correcting code.
Authentication of Concurrent Transmissions (TX):
FEAT is robust to interference as discussed in Section 5.2.
Hence, in presence of concurrent transmissions from Alice
and Eve, each of the two can be authenticated at Dave.
However, neither Gelato nor ATM can be used to extract
the authentication signal from the received signal corrupted
by interference from the similar type of signal.
In ATM,
the phase oﬀsets in the received samples containing the au-
thentication signals from Alice and Eve cannot be separated.
In Gelato, in the absence of interference, each OFDM sym-
bol contains one signature. But, when the received signal
contains signals from multiple transmitters, multiple cyclo-
stationary signatures can be observed in the received OFDM
symbol, and there is no way to extract the authentication
signature corresponding to a speciﬁc transmitter.
Blind Authentication: At a receiver, after down con-
verting and sampling the received signal, time and frequency
synchronization are the ﬁrst steps to be performed to extract
the message signal. A signiﬁcant amount of work has been
done in the ﬁeld of blind (non-data-aided) parameter estima-
tion, e.g., time and frequency oﬀset estimation, for OFDM
signals [12, 15, 23, 33]. Also, it has been shown in [14] that
carrier frequency oﬀset (CFO) is an intrinsic characteristic
of a transmitter, and it can be used for authentication. Note
that the actual CFO of an oscillator in a transmitter usually
remains close to a constant value although some variations
may be caused due to long life-span, temperature, and other
environmental factors. Moreover, it has been shown in [21]
that an authentication signal can be extrinsically embedded
into the pilot symbols of the message signal in the form of
frequency oﬀsets. However, the blind receiver cannot utilize
this scheme due to lack of knowledge of the pilot symbols.
In FEAT, the authentication signal is embedded into each
frame of the message signal using frequency oﬀset such that
it can be extracted using the techniques of blind parame-
ter estimation. However, Dave (the blind receiver) needs
to know the center frequency and the sampling frequency
of the transmitted signal to authenticate the received sig-
nal. Gelato with the sample and symbol synchronization
mechanism (proposed in this paper) can be used with the
same knowledge as needed in FEAT. In ATM, other than
the center frequency and the sampling frequency, the blind
receiver also needs to know the modulation being used by
the transmitter.
In general, the center frequency and the
sampling frequency depend on the standard to be utilized
to set up the network [26] and hence, their knowledge can
be considered to be available a priory. However, modula-
tion schemes depend on the channel conditions between the
transmitter and the intended receivers and hence, it is sub-
ject to change. This means that FEAT and Gelato enable
blind authentication, but ATM does not.
Security: Considering that the contents and the length
of the authentication signal in the three schemes are same,
we compare the robustness of the scheme in the case where
Eve may attempt to corrupt the authentication signal trans-
mitted by Alice, i.e. OOA jamming attack. Since FEAT is
the most robust scheme against interference, it is also the
most robust scheme against OOA jamming attack. More-
over, since FEAT is the most robust scheme against noise as
shown in Figure 7a, it is also the most secure scheme against
incessant jamming.

of a time-stamp and a text, and is transmitted without any
error correction coding. The authentication signal consists
of a set of random bits for synchronization, a time-stamp
and a text data without any error correction coding. It is
embedded into the message signal using FEAT with M = 2
and fa = 1 kHz. Since Bob is the receiver with the knowl-
edge of all the PHY-layer parameters, he demodulates and
decodes the received signal. The received message signal
is synchronized using a time-stamp, and compared with the
transmitted message signal to calculate the BER of the mes-
sage signal.

cussed in Section 3.2. Note that FEAT outperforms the
prior art in every respect except for authentication rate.
7. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
We conducted a number of experiments using an imple-
mentation of FEAT. In the experiments, we used three Uni-
versal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) radios, one each
for Alice (transmitter), Bob (aware receiver), and Dave (blind
receiver). National Instruments’ LabVIEW is utilized as the
system-design platform to conﬁgure the three USRPs. Al-
ice and Bob use IEEE 802.11af [26] to communicate with
each other. Alice also embeds an authentication signal us-
ing FEAT so that Dave is able to authenticate Alice.
Model and Assumptions: The three radios are placed
in an indoor environment in such a way that the distance
between any two radios is approximately 1 meter. The dis-
tances between the radios are limited by the fact that all
the radios need to be connected to the computer running
the LabVIEW application through network cables. Hence,
to obtain a wide range of SNR values (from −10 dB to 10
dB), we add Gaussian noise at Bob and Dave in addition to
the channel-induced noise added to the signal transmitted
over-the-air. Here, we assume that adding Gaussian noise
after receiving the signal is equivalent to increasing the dis-
tance between the transmitter and the receivers.
Design: We utilize the following PHY-layer parameters—
the center frequency Fc = 915 MHz, the sampling frequency
Fs = 1 MHz, IFFT size Nf = 64, the CP size Nc = 16,
the number of useful sub-carriers Nu = 52 (48 for data sam-
ples and 4 for pilot samples), and the number of symbols in
each frame Ns = 50. The preamble consists of four sym-
bols (i.e., Np = 4)—two symbols each for short and long
preamble sequence. We utilize quadrature amplitude shift
keying (QPSK) as the modulation scheme for the message
signal. The data contained in the message signal consists
Dave extracts the authentication signal by synchronizing
with the received signal which is processed in blocks of 1
million samples (i.e., the number of samples received per
second). Since the processing overhead needed to achieve
synchronization is quite high, the parameters such as IFFT
size ((cid:98)Nf ), CP size ((cid:98)Nc), and frame size ((cid:98)Ns) are estimated
experiments, we noticed that the value of sample oﬀset ((cid:98)α)
hardware platforms. Hence, the sample oﬀset ((cid:98)α) and sym-
bol oﬀset ((cid:98)β) are estimated for each block of received sam-
only for the ﬁrst block of the received samples. During the
changes slowly because of the clock mismatch between the
ples. The received authentication signal is synchronized us-
ing the synchronization bits, and compared with the trans-
mitted authentication signal to calculate the BER of the
authentication signal.
Figure 8 shows the LabVIEW VI of Alice illustrating the
various steps needed to embed an authentication symbol into
a frame of the message signal. The message signal is gener-
ated by creating conventional OFDM signals—mapping the
message bits to QAM symbols, performing IFFT, adding
CP, and adding preamble symbols. To embed the authen-
tication signal, the message signal is multiplied sample-by-
sample with a vector which embeds the frequency oﬀset; this
process is carried out by the blocks enclosed in the gray box
shown in Figure 8.
Results: Figure 9 shows the error performance of the
message signal at Bob (M Sb) and the authentication sig-
nal at Dave (ASd). The error performance from Matlab
simulations with the same PHY-layer parameters are also
presented as a benchmark. We observe that the error per-
formance of the USRP implementation is quite close to the
error performance obtained from the simulations in the case
of the authentication signal. However, the same is not true
for the message signal. This result can be explained by rec-
ognizing the fact that the channel noise is Gaussian in the
simulations, whereas the channel noise is not truly Gaussian
in the over-the-air experiments when the message signal is
decoded sample-by-sample. However, when an authentica-
tion symbol is estimated by correlating the CP samples of
length Nc · Ns = 800 with their corresponding data sam-
ples of equal length, then the channel noise added in the

for the authentication signal as a result of the central limit
theorem.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have deﬁned the BTA problem, and pro-
posed a novel scheme called FEAT that satisﬁes all of the
required criteria of the BTA problem. Through analytical
analysis, simulations, and experiments with an USRP-based
implementation, we have shown that FEAT is a viable ap-
proach for authenticating transmitters even in very harsh
channel environments, where the SINR is low and the mul-
tipath fading is signiﬁcant.
