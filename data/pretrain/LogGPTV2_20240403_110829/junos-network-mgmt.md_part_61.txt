framing and control word overhead. (See Table 68 on page 741.)

The performance of a service provider’s network is usually defined as how well it can support services,
and is measured with metrics such as delay and utilization. We suggest that you monitor the following
performance metrics using applications such as InfoVista Service Performance Management or Concord
Network Health (see Table 69 on page 742).

This section includes the following topics:
Measure Class of Service
You can use class-of-service (CoS) mechanisms to regulate how certain classes of packets are handled
within your network during times of peak congestion. Typically you must perform the following steps
when implementing a CoS mechanism:
746
• Identify the type of packets that is applied to this class. For example, include all customer traffic from
a specific ingress edge interface within one class, or include all packets of a particular protocol such
as voice over IP (VoIP).
• Identify the required deterministic behavior for each class. For example, if VoIP is important, give
VoIP traffic the highest priority during times of network congestion. Conversely, you can downgrade
the importance of Web traffic during congestion, as it may not impact customers too much.
With this information, you can configure mechanisms at the network ingress to monitor, mark, and
police traffic classes. Marked traffic can then be handled in a more deterministic way at egress
interfaces, typically by applying different queuing mechanisms for each class during times of network
congestion. You can collect information from the network to provide customers with reports showing
how the network is behaving during times of congestion. (See Figure 29 on page 746.)
Figure 29: Network Behavior During Congestion
To generate these reports, routers must provide the following information:
• Submitted traffic—Amount of traffic received per class.
• Delivered traffic—Amount of traffic transmitted per class.
• Dropped traffic—Amount of traffic dropped because of CoS limits.
The following section outlines how this information is provided by Juniper Networks routers.
747
Inbound Firewall Filter Counters per Class
Firewall filter counters are a very flexible mechanism you can use to match and count inbound traffic per
class, per interface. For example:
firewall {
filter f1 {
term t1 {
from {
dscp af11;
}
then {
# Assured forwarding class 1 drop profile 1 count inbound-af11;
accept;
}
}
}
}
For example, Table 70 on page 747 shows additional filters used to match the other classes.
Table 70: Inbound Traffic Per Class
DSCP Value Firewall Match Condition Description
10 af11 Assured forwarding class 1 drop profile 1
12 af12 Assured forwarding class 1 drop profile 2
18 af21 Best effort class 2 drop profile 1
20 af22 Best effort class 2 drop profile 2
26 af31 Best effort class 3 drop profile 1
Any packet with a CoS DiffServ code point (DSCP) conforming to RFC 2474 can be counted in this way.
The Juniper Networks enterprise-specific Firewall Filter MIB presents the counter information in the
variables shown in Table 71 on page 748.
