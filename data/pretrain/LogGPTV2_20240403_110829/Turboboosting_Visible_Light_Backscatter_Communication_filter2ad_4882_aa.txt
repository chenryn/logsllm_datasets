ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the feasibility of practical backscatter com-
munication using visible light for battery-free IoT applications.
Based on the idea of modulating the light retroreflection with a
commercial LCD shutter, we effectively synthesize these off-the-
shelf optical components into a sub-mW low power visible light
passive transmitter along with a retroreflecting uplink design dedi-
cated for power constrained mobile/IoT devices. On top of that, we
design, implement and evaluate PassiveVLC, a novel visible light
backscatter communication system. PassiveVLC system enables
a battery-free tag device to perform passive communication with
the illuminating LEDs over the same light carrier and thus offers
several favorable features including battery-free, sniff-proof, and
biologically friendly for human-centric use cases. Experimental re-
sults from our prototyped system show that PassiveVLC is flexible
with tag orientation, robust to ambient lighting conditions, and
can achieve up to 1 kbps uplink speed. Link budget analysis and
two proof-of-concept applications are developed to demonstrate
PassiveVLC’s efficacy and practicality.

The grand vision of Internet-of-Things (IoT) – bring everything
to the Internet to better sense, understand and actuate the real
world – is turning into reality at a quick pace. Indeed, most new
generation of devices, ranging from externally powered home ap-
pliances [6, 32], mobile objects with large batteries [4], to miniature

implantable sensors [42], thin and flexible wearables [15, 35], etc.,
have claimed “IoT-capable”. However, to fully realize the IoT vision,
far larger amount of smart devices are yet to be deployed. Such
devices are likely to be of small form factor, wireless communica-
tion and untethered when operating. Thus, energy consumption
naturally becomes an obstacle. Analysis reveals that communica-
tion takes a significant portion of the overall energy consumption
for typical IoT sensing devices. In consequence, how to enable ex-
tremely energy efficient wireless communication has become an
active research front.
Recently, research efforts have shown that radio backscatter com-
munication [23, 50] can effectively offer near zero-power (orders of
µW ) connectivity to small sensor devices and thus becomes a com-
petitive communication paradigm in the IoT era. The major idea
behind radio backscattering is to leverage existing infrastructures,
such as TV band [31], FM radio [46] and WiFi channel [11, 22, 23, 49].
Along the line but exploring a different infrastructure – the lighting
infrastructure, some previous work have demonstrated the possibil-
ity of backscattering the visible light for communications [28, 41].
Using light as the transmission medium, visible light communi-
cation (VLC) systems natively possess certain compelling merits,
such as sniffing-proof and biological friendliness, over radio com-
munication in human-centric applications. However, it is nontrivial
to build a visible light backscatter system. Several issues need to be
solved. First of all, in contrast to omni-directional radio propaga-
tion, the light is highly directional. While this property contributes
to the favorable sniffing-proof feature, it requires precise mutual
pointing between two communicating ends, which further demands
the system to have accurate (relative) positioning capability and
steerable optical components for proper alignment.
Secondly, unlike radio backscatter systems where the antenna
coupling is highly efficient for their narrow specific spectrum band,
the efficiency of optical coupling is typically very low (e.g. usu-
ally less than 20% via solar panels) as the visible light takes ex-
tremely wide spectrum. Direct optical coupling could neither har-
vest enough energy (e.g. hundreds of µW in indoor environments)
to power up a high power LED (typically with hundreds of mW
budget), nor its on/off state could effectively affect (hence directly
modulate) the visible light transmission. Note that optical light
concentrating components may help, but, again, it would require
precise pointing and additional cost.
RetroVLC [28] solves these issues by exploiting the very nature
of a retroreflector, i.e. reflecting the light back almost exactly along
its incoming path, which not only achieves all-the-time precise
pointing but also naturally concentrates the light energy for a point

rics and adopts On-off keying (OOK) communication for the uplink
with a MCU-controlled LCD shutter, which however fundamentally
limits the data rate – the fixed response time (e.g. a few milliseconds)
of the commercial LCD when manufactured throttles its highest
switching rate for OOK modulation. In addition, the nonlinear re-
sponses of LCD state to voltage changes makes it very difficult to
produce precise multi-level signals, especially in the context of IoT
devices. With these observations, the authors in [41] extended the
idea of RetroVLC and resorted to use a plural of retroreflectors and
LCD shutters to improve the data rate. A reflector and a LCD shut-
ter form a ‘pixel’, each pixel can be switched on/off independently,
and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is adopted to increase the
rate in proportional to the number of pixels.
In this paper, we seek to improve the data rate of RetroVLC from
the very heart of any communication system – the coding and
modulation schemes. In particular, we make two key observations.
Firstly, the Manchester coding used in RetroVLC is not optimized for
bandwidth efficiency. Secondly, it is not necessary to “fully” switch
on/off the LCD to convey a signal. When an LCD is charged or
discharged, its transparency will change continuously and leads to a
trend of increasing or decreasing signal strength at the receiver side.
As long as this trend is distinguishable, we may stop the charing or
discharging process early. Note that the distinguishability depends
on the communication range and SNR, and should be set according
to typical working range in practice. In addition, different LCD
shutters may have different turn-over rate, but this observation
remains valid as it is based on the intrinsic properties of LCD.
With these observations, we renovate the RetroVLC design with
two major innovations: 1) We replace Manchester coding with
Miller code, which doubles the bandwidth utilization and is still
immune to the clock drift. This essentially yields 2x data rate im-
provement in theory; 2) We design a trend-based modulation and
code-assisted demodulation scheme. This design effectively reduces
the modulation time, hence directly translates to an increase in data
rate. In our prototype, we managed to reduce the modulation time
from 4 ms to 1 ms, which gives another 4x boost in data rate. It is
nontrivial to achieve this change in demodulation as the dependen-
cies between symbols and restrictions from coding scheme have
to be taken into consideration. We formulate it as an optimization
problem and solve it with dynamic programming. Note that the
increased complexity solely happens at the reader side, and the tag
(i.e. the IoT device) is not affected. As a remark, our innovation is
orthogonal to that in [41] – the two can be combined to further
improve the data rate.
In the following, we present the design, implementation and
evaluation of PassiveVLC– a practical visible light backscatter com-
munication subsystem for low-power IoT applications. We have
prototyped PassiveVLC to demonstrate its practicality for deploy-
ments – the battery-free ViTag is approximately the size of a credit
card and the ViReader could be organically integrated into normal
LED-based illuminating infrastructure (e.g. flashlights or lamps),
as shown in Fig. 1. We benchmarked our system under different
ambient lighting conditions such as office environments, outdoor
daytime/night and dark chamber. Experiments show that our ViTag
prototype can achieve up to 1 kbps uplink speed, which is ∼8x in

practice speedup as compared to our implementation of RetroVLC,
with a 120 ◦ flexible orientation under sub-mW power budget.
To better understand the design tradeoff (form factor, working
range, etc.) among various components in PassiveVLC, based on the
benchmark data, we derive and verify a joint link budget analysis
for the downlink and uplink, which can serve as a guidance for
developing PassiveVLC-enabled applications. Finally, we have built
two proof-of-concept applications that illustrate the potential of
PassiveVLC in real-world IoT applications. The first application is
a smart check-in system where a ViReader-enabled door will auto-
matically grant the access when a ViTag-bearing user walks into its
working range. The second is an optical IoT networking solution
where a ViReader-capable lighting LED infrastructure interrogates
multiple ViTag-bearing IoT devices for streaming sensor readings.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Design Considerations
PassiveVLC is essentially a two-way communication link using
visible light, while fulfills the following two basic requirements:
• Efficiency: Operate under a low-power budget, e.g., can work
on a battery-free mobile/IoT end that harvests light energy from
the illumination LED.
• Practicality: Impose as little constraints as possible on actual
use. This implies a practical working range in normal indoor
situations, flexible tag orientation, and small size of the device.
These requirements immediately exclude a symmetric design, i.e.,
using a LED to establish the uplink to the reader because a practical
working range would require a high power LED which is not quite

affordable by a small IoT device. It also excludes the adoption of
optical light concentration component such as laser (to extend
the working range) or mirror (to save the power for transmission
power) as they would incur the overhead of precise pointing, a
consequence of aforementioned directional propagation property
of light. Inspired by free space laser communication systems [37],
we use a retroreflector to meet both requirements.
2.2 Retroreflector and LCD Shutter
We introduce the principles and some (favorable) properties of the
retroreflector and LCD.
2.2.1 Retroreflector As a Backscatter. A retroreflector is a device
or surface that, unlike mirrors, reflects light back to its source along
almost exactly the same incoming direction with little scattering [8].
A retroreflector can be produced using spherical lenses or a corner
reflector with three mutually perpendicular reflective surfaces. A
large yet relatively thin retroreflector is possible by combining many
small corner reflectors, using the standard triangular tiling. Cheap
retroreflector material are readily available, e.g. the 3M Scotchlite
Reflective Material Fabrics [1], and are widely used on road signs,
bicycles, and clothing for road safety, especially at night.
The ability to bounce back light from any incidence angle to
its source leads to a favorable energy concentration property of the
retroreflector, as is illustrated in Fig. 2: light energy from a point
light source being shed onto the surface area of a retroflector will
be reflected back and concentrated to nearby the point light source.
2.2.2 Modulation with LCD Shutter. While retroreflectors can be
used to modulate information bits, e.g., by electronically controlling
the reflection or absorption state using micro-electromechanical
systems (MEMS) [12, 19, 33, 52] or semiconductor multiple quantum
wells (MQW) technologies [21, 38], we hope to use off-the-shelf
retroreflector fabrics for its thinness, flexibility and low cost. To
modulate the lights reflected by such fabric, an LCD shutter that can
pass or block light under the control of electrical field is adopted.
An LCD has a multi-layer sandwich structure. At the two ends of
the LCD panel are two polarizer films whose polarization direction
is fixed (often perpendicular to each other). In the middle are two
glass electrodes that encompass a layer of nematic phase liquid
crystal. Depending on the actual twisted or untwisted state of liquid
crystal molecules, the polarity of passing light may be altered (called
optical rotation [17]) or keep untouched, which will further cause

the light to pass or be blocked by the polarizer film. We thus can
toggle the pass/block state of the whole LCD by imposing an electric
field (through the two surrounding glass electrodes) on the liquid
crystal layer. Note the liquid crystal molecules cannot instantly
toggle between twisted and untwisted state. It typically takes in
the range of few milliseconds, or termed as “response time”, which
