Is it possible to install TensorFlow in a Windows environment? I noticed that "pip install" is not supported on Windows. Are there any plans to support it in the future?

For clarity, TensorFlow can indeed be installed on Windows using `pip`. If you encountered issues, it might be due to specific constraints or errors. Here’s a more detailed approach:

1. **Ensure Python and pip are installed**: Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your Windows system. You can check this by running `python --version` and `pip --version` in the command prompt.

2. **Install TensorFlow via pip**: Open the command prompt and run the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

3. **Check for compatibility**: Ensure that your Python version is compatible with the TensorFlow version you are trying to install. TensorFlow 2.x supports Python 3.6–3.9.

4. **Use a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies more effectively.
   ```sh
   python -m venv myenv
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about the error messages you are seeing, and I can help troubleshoot further.
