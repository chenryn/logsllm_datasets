### Log Analysis and Error Report

#### Summary
The following log entries detail the status and errors encountered during a Kubernetes deployment test. The logs indicate that several pods were started, but various Docker operations experienced high error rates. Additionally, there were latency issues with pod start times and other operations. The test ultimately failed due to a timeout while waiting for a specific pod to become "running."

#### Detailed Log Entries

- **Pod Start Times:**
  - `kube-proxy-gke-jenkins-e2e-f1ec7fe0-node-l2sf` started at (0 container statuses recorded)
  - `nginx-controller-uub6h` started at (0 container statuses recorded)
  - `mutability-test-0u77q` started at (0 container statuses recorded)

- **Throttling Requests:**
  - A request to `https://104.197.114.165/api/v1/proxy/nodes/gke-jenkins-e2e-f1ec7fe0-node-l2sf:10250/metrics` was throttled, taking 186.69363ms.
  - Multiple requests to `https://104.197.114.165/api/v1/nodes` and `https://104.197.114.165/api/v1/namespaces/e2e-tests-deployment-1groa` were also throttled, with delays ranging from 85.009715ms to 198.041997ms.

- **Docker Operation Errors:**
  - `kubelet_docker_errors{operation_type="info"}`: 1 error
  - `kubelet_docker_errors{operation_type="inspect_image"}`: 47 errors
  - `kubelet_docker_errors{operation_type="list_containers"}`: 65 errors

  - `kubelet_docker_errors{operation_type="stop_container"}`: 35 errors
  - `kubelet_docker_errors{operation_type="version"}`: 54 errors

- **Latency Metrics:**
  - `pod_start_latency_microseconds` (0.99 quantile): 3m40.295878s
  - `pod_worker_latency_microseconds` (create, 0.99 quantile): 55.520147s
  - `container_manager_latency_microseconds` (SyncPod, 0.99 quantile): 55.43854s
  - `pod_worker_latency_microseconds` (sync, 0.99 quantile): 53.258439s
  - `pod_worker_latency_microseconds` (create, 0.9 quantile): 46.526966s
  - `pod_start_latency_microseconds` (0.9 quantile): 38.751172s

  - `docker_operations_latency_microseconds` (stop_container, 0.99 quantile): 30.13602s
  - `docker_operations_latency_microseconds` (pull_image, 0.99 quantile): 28.482251s
  - `container_manager_latency_microseconds` (SyncPod, 0.9 quantile): 28.406635s
  - `docker_operations_latency_microseconds` (pull_image, 0.9 quantile): 11.708849s
  - `pod_worker_latency_microseconds` (sync, 0.9 quantile): 11.355813s

- **Test Status:**
  - The test waited up to 1 minute for all nodes to be ready.
  - The test failed after 474.984 seconds.
  - The failure occurred in the `Deployment` test, specifically in the `RollingUpdateDeployment should delete old pods and create new ones` step.
  - The error message indicates that the test gave up waiting for the pod `nginx-controller-hpovs` to become "running" after 5 minutes.

#### Conclusion
The test failed due to a timeout while waiting for the `nginx-controller-hpovs` pod to become "running." This issue is likely related to the high number of Docker operation errors and the significant latencies observed in various operations. 

This error appears to be different from the one tracked in issue #21753. Therefore, a separate issue has been opened to track this problem. For triage, this issue is assigned to @bgrant0607. If this issue is a duplicate, please resolve it accordingly.
