It's often useful to avoid duplicate work by performing an assignment at the
same time as evaluating a condition, i.e.
    if (val = expensive()) != nothing
      val
    else ...
If a function predicate is used, this is parsed as a keyword argument and
throws an error:
    if isvalid(true, (val = expensive()))
      ...
    else ...
Assignments inside brackets are special cased when using `&&`, `||` etc., it
might be useful if they were here, too. `name = val` would be a keyword
argument but `(name = val)` would be a regular assignment.
