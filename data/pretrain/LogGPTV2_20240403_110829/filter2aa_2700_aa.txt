Don’t have to work for ”the man”, but 
work time breakdown is roughly: 
– 1/3 actual pentesting (fun) 
– 1/3 administrative tasks and documentation 
– 1/3 being a sales weazel (finding clients!)

Research Motivation – Old Skool 
Reporting vulnerabilities to vendors 
back in the day (and sometimes 
today) was often a hassle! 
Researchers would  
instead find alternatives...

Some Early Bounties 
• Some vendors / security companies             
realize that rewarding discoveries is                 
an incentive for researchers to report              
their findings. 
• August 2002, iDefense creates VCP      
(Vulnerability Coordination Program) 
• August 2004, Mozilla creates their                 
bug bounty program, paying USD 500             
for critical bugs

Netscape – October 1995 
• Netscape actually launched the Netscape Bugs 
Bounty back in October 1995 to improve the 
security of their products. 
• Interestingly, their approach was to offer cash 
for vulnerabilities reported in the latest beta 
– Wanted to incentive researchers to help secure it 
before going into stable release 
– Not unlike part of Microsoft’s bounty program 
today.

Full Disclosure 
• 2000 - 2008 disclosure was a huge battle 
ground between vendors and researchers 
• Researchers still had problems getting 
vendors to respond... 
• Perception (true or not) was that vendors 
only fixed bugs when dropped 
• Researchers were hardcore Full 
Disclosure the ”right” way 
– Importance placed on getting bugs fixed / improving 
security

Pwn2Own – A Bug Bounty Contest 
• Created in 2007 for CanSecWest 
– Chance to win x2 Macbook Pro and USD $10k from 
ZDI 
• Big money on the line in 2010 
– Total cash prize pool of USD $100,000 
• Competition brings lots of PR and growing cash 
incentives

No More Free Bugs 
• In March 2009 at CanSecWest, researchers 
announce their new philosophy: ”No More 
Free Bugs”. 
• It’s not really clear how much effect this had 
• At least sparked a debate about the issue, and 
made (some) researchers’ expectations of 
monetary compensation more publicly known.
