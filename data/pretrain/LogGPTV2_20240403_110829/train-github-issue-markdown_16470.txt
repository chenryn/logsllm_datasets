During the process of upgrading my application from Symfony 2.4 to Symfony 2.5, I encountered an issue with a specific service.

### Issue Description
A service that was previously working with the `validator.initializer` tag is no longer being called.

### Service Definition
```yaml
cpl.sitebundle.canonicalizer:
    class: Cpl\SiteBundle\Validator\Canonicalizer
    tags:
        - { name: validator.initializer }
```

### Functionality
This service is responsible for populating a "canonical" field on multiple entities before validation. The logic is similar to the `Name_canonical` field in FOSUserBundle.

### Additional Context
- **Symfony Version**: Upgraded from 2.4 to 2.5
- **Service Purpose**: Ensures that the "canonical" field is correctly set on entities before they are validated.

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.
