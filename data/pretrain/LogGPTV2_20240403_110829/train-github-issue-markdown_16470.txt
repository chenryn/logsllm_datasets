I tried to upgrade my application from Sf 2.4 to Sf 2.5 and I discovered a bug
:
A service working with the "validator.initializer" tag, is not called anymore.
Service definition :
cpl.sitebundle.canonicalizer:  
class: Cpl\SiteBundle\Validator\Canonicalizer  
tags:  
\- { name: validator.initializer }
This service fill a "canonical" field on many entities before validations
(same logic as FOSUserbundle "Name_canonical" field).
Thank you
