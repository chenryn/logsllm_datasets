User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of computing and storing data from the hdfs://10.10.34.11:9000/pjhe/logs/2kSOSP.log file. The CacheManager is looking for partitions rdd_42_12, rdd_42_13, and rdd_42_14, and the HadoopRDD is providing input splits for each. The PythonRunner is timing the total, boot, init, and finish times for each partition. The MemoryStore is storing each partition as bytes in memory, and the Executor is running tasks and sending results to the driver.
