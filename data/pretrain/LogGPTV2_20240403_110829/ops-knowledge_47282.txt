User: When attempting to connect to a PostgreSQL database with ODBC I get the following error:

('08P01', '[08P01] [unixODBC]ERROR: Unsupported startup parameter: geqo (210) (SQLDriverConnect)')

I get this with two different ODBC front-ends (pyodbc for Python and ODBC.jl for Julia), so it's clearly coming from the ODBC library itself.  Is there a way to stop it from passing this "geqo" parameter?
An example in pyodbc would be very useful.
Thanks.
