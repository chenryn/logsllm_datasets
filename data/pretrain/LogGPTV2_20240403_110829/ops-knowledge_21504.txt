User: How to use Docker Compose to manage the deployment of multiple containers?
Assistant: The deployment of multiple Docker containers can be easily managed using Docker Compose. The following are the steps: 1. Write a Docker Compose configuration file: define container services, map ports, mount data volumes, specify environment variables, etc. 2. Start the container service: By executing the docker-compose up command, Docker Compose will start the required container service according to the configuration file. 3. View the container service: By executing docker-compose ps, you can view the status of the container and the network where it is located. 4. Operate container services: You can execute commands like docker ps, docker stop, docker start, etc. to manage container services, just add docker-compose before the command. 5. Stop container services: By executing the docker-compose down command, you can stop and delete all container services. It should be noted that Docker Compose will create a default network to connect all containers, so different containers can communicate directly through the container name. At the same time, Docker Compose also supports multi-host deployment, and you can configure related parameters of multiple hosts by specifying env_file or environment variables.
