ABSTRACT
Congestion detection is the cornerstone of end-to-end congestion
control. Through in-depth observations and understandings, we re-
veal that existing congestion detection mechanisms in mainstream
lossless networks (i.e., Converged Enhanced Ethernet and Infini-
Band) are improper, due to failing to cognize the interaction be-
tween hop-by-hop flow controls and congestion detection behaviors
in switches. We define ternary states of switch ports and present
Ternary Congestion Detection (TCD) for mainstream lossless net-
works. Testbed and extensive simulations demonstrate that TCD
can detect congestion ports accurately and identify flows contribut-
ing to congestion as well as flows only affected by hop-by-hop
flow controls. Meanwhile, we shed light on how to incorporate
TCD with rate control. Case studies show that existing congestion
control algorithms can achieve 3.3× and 2.0× better median and
99th-percentile FCT slowdown by combining with TCD.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the advantages of zero packet loss and low latency, lossless
network has become an attractive trend in cluster systems. Packet
loss can significantly affect application tail latency and throughput,
thus revenue [12, 37, 57]. Besides, Remote Direct Memory Accesses
(RDMA) technology also requires no packet loss to achieve the best
performance [41]. Today two mainstream lossless networks are
Converged Enhanced Ethernet (CEE) and InfiniBand. It is reported
that InfiniBand is the most used interconnect in the TOP500 list and
is deployed in 70% of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems
in academic, research, and institutions [3, 5]. CEE is increasingly

adopted for data storage and latency-sensitive services in enterprise
datacenters [24, 34, 38].
Lossless networks rely on hop-by-hop flow controls to guar-
antee zero packet loss under normal operations. InfiniBand em-
ploys Credit Based Flow Control (CBFC) [13], while Priority Flow
Control (PFC) is developed to enable RDMA over Converged Eth-
ernet (RoCE) [2]. However, hop-by-hop flow controls can cause
collateral damages, including head-of-line blocking, unfairness and
even deadlock [24, 28, 50, 56]. Therefore, end-to-end congestion
control is needed and has received significant attention recently
[16, 23, 38, 39, 51, 56].
Congestion detection is the cornerstone of end-to-end congestion
control. Both Data Center Bridging (DCB) Task Group [1] and
InfiniBand Specification [13] specify congestion management in the
individual network but endow a similar framework where switches
detect congestion and endpoints conduct rate control. Through in-
depth observations and analysis, we reveal that existing congestion
detection mechanisms in lossless networks are improper due to
failing to cognize the impact of hop-by-hop flow controls. In lossless
networks, switch ports can alternate between sending (ON) and
pausing (OFF). Specifically, the ON-OFF sending pattern can impose
unexpected effects on congestion detection behaviors in switches,
including causing queue buildup and affecting the real input rate
of pausing ports.
In the light of our observations and understandings, we define
ternary states of switch ports and propose Ternary Congestion
Detection (TCD) for lossless networks. The ternary states are con-
gestion (1), non-congestion (0), and undetermined (/). The port in a
congestion state is where congestion occurs, with queue buildup
not caused by OFF. We name the state of ports in the ON-OFF
sending pattern as undetermined because its real input rate may be
masked due to the ON-OFF sending pattern of its upstream ports.
We elaborate on the state transitions among ternary states, espe-
cially transitions from the undetermined state to the congestion
state, which is the key for congestion detection in lossless networks.
We present a uniform design of TCD for mainstream lossless
networks, including CEE and InfiniBand. TCD can be implemented
on switches with low overhead. Further, TCD can notify both con-
gested flows (i.e., flows passing through congestion ports) and
undetermined flows (i.e., flows only passing through undetermined
ports) to endpoints.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• Providing an in-depth understanding of the impact of hop-by-
hop flow controls on congestion detection in lossless networks and
defining ternary states.
• Developing a novel congestion detection mechanism named
TCD, which utilizes the ON-OFF sending pattern and the feature
of queue length evolution to detect the transitions among ternary

tect congestion ports accurately, and identify congested flows and
undetermined flows.
• Incorporating TCD with existing congestion controls, includ-
ing DCQCN [56], TIMELY [43], and IB CC [13]. Case studies show
that existing congestion controls can achieve better performance by
performing aggressive rate adjustment for congested flows while
gentle rate adjustment for undetermined flows. Simulations with re-
alistic workloads show that existing congestion controls combining
TCD can improve the median and 99th-percentile FCT slowdown
by 3.3× and 2.0×, respectively.
This work does not raise any ethical issues.
2 BACKGROUND
Generally, congestion detection is conducted by switches in exist-
ing lossless networks. Congestion management developed by DCB
Task Group includes two significant components: Congestion Point
(CP) responsible for congestion detection, and Reaction Point (RP)
responsible for rate control. Analogously, InfiniBand Specification
specifies the framework of congestion control in InfiniBand net-
works, where the switch detects congestion and Channel Adapter
(CA) conducts injection throttling.
2.1 Congestion Detection Mechanisms in
Lossless Networks
In CEE, DCB Task Group specifies QCN in IEEE 802.1 Qau [1]. In
QCN, CP computes a congestion measure by sampling queue size.
Because QCN does not support for L3 networks, DCQCN [56] is
developed and widely adopted in CEE. Similar with QCN, DCQCN
detects congestion based on queue size. CP marks packets with
ECN [46] according to the RED algorithm [20]. A single bit ECN
marking indicates the presence of congestion.
In InfiniBand, InfiniBand Specification specifies IB CC [13]. Switches
are supposed to identify two cases: (a) If the queue of an output
port exceeds a threshold and there are available credits to send
packets, then it is the root cause; (b) If the queue of an output port
exceeds a selected threshold and packets are delayed due to lack of
credits, then it is the victim. Finally, a switch port is considered as
congested and marks packets with Forward ECN (FECN) bit when
it is a root cause of congestion. For CA, a single bit FECN marking
indicates the presence of congestion.
To conclude, existing congestion detection mechanisms in CEE
and IB essentially detect incipient congestion by queue size, which
following the practice in traditional lossy networks. Besides utiliz-
ing the queue length as the primary congestion indicator, IB CC
combines credits information to detect congestion.

2.2 Flow Controls for Lossless Networks
To guarantee the drop-free property, CEE employs Priority Flow
Control (PFC), and InfiniBand employs Credit-Based Flow Con-
trol (CBFC), as shown in Figure 1. Here we briefly describe the
operations of each flow control.
In PFC, the downstream switch sends a PAUSE frame to the
upstream switch when the ingress queue exceeds a threshold 𝑋𝑜 𝑓 𝑓 ,
and sends a RESUME frame when the ingress queue decreases to
another threshold 𝑋𝑜𝑛. The upstream switch can only send when
the egress queue is not paused.
In CBFC, the downstream switch maintains an Adjust Block Reg-
ister (ABR) to record total received blocks. Besides, the downstream
switch sends a Flow Control Credit Limit (FCCL) message to the
upstream switch periodically, which contains the sum of allocated
buffer size and ABR. The upstream switch maintains a Flow Control
Total Block Sent (FCTBS) register to record total sent blocks. After
receiving the FCCL message, the number of available credits is the
difference between FCCL and FCTBS. Then the upstream switch
can only send a packet when there are available credits.
PFC operates on a per-priority level. CBFC operates on a per
Virtual Lane (VL) level. The number of priority queues and VLs is
