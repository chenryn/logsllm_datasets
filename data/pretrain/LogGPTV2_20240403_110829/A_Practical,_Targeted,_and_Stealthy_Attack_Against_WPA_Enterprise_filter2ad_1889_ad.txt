### Physical Layer Attacks and Defenses

At the physical layer, achieving stealthy and targeted attacks is a significant concern. Various proposals in the literature aim to counteract "evil twin" attacks, but none are entirely effective against our proposed attack. 

#### Secure Device Pairing
Secure device pairing methods [40, 32, 23] leverage properties of or around the devices to establish their identity. These approaches often require line-of-sight access to the access point (AP) or assume that the attacker cannot co-locate with the device. However, our attack can target both long-range and close-range scenarios. The use of dedicated hardware can make the attack less conspicuous, allowing for deployment with plug devices or smaller form factors, making it difficult to detect physically.

#### Trust-on-First-Use Protocols
Protocols that rely on trust-on-first-use assume that the first configuration of a network occurs in a secure environment. Our attack exploits this assumption by creating a new, seemingly legitimate network, thereby rendering trust-on-first-use approaches vulnerable [4, 22].

#### Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS)
Wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS) capture packets and search for attack patterns [13]. If an attack is detected, the WIPS alerts a supervisor and may terminate the overheard exchanges. However, our attack involves posing as a legitimate access point to the client and can even spoof a jammed AP's hardware address. From the perspective of a WIPS, our attack appears indistinguishable from a normal association.

#### Device Fingerprinting
Device fingerprinting assumes that the evil twin hardware differs from the victim's deployment and sends malformed probe packets to elicit responses, which are then compared against a device table [7]. This approach requires the evil twin to respond to the probe packets. Our targeted jamming and response approach necessitates that the probe knows the attack target beforehand. Additionally, the use of directional antennas forces the probe to co-locate with the victim, limiting its effectiveness. An attacker using the same hardware as the victim would be undetectable under this approach.

### Password-Based Authentication
A substantial body of work in security literature has studied attacks against password-based authentication, ranging from dictionary attacks like John the Ripper [37] to time-space trade-off approaches such as rainbow tables [25, 36] and probabilistic methods like Markov models [34] and context-free grammars [48] derived from public password lists.

In the WPA world, wpacracker is a recent commercial effort that leverages cloud resources to crack WPA2-PSK passwords [31]. However, wpacracker targets challenges exchanged between two nodes with a shared secret. Our work, on the other hand, is an end-to-end attack against WPA Enterprise networks. The most significant similarity between the two efforts is the use of cloud computing to parallelize the plaintext recovery process.

While our attack relies on a robust password cracking component to recover WPA Enterprise passphrases, it is agnostic to the underlying technique used. In our current prototype, we utilize parallel DES cracking techniques on GPUs and can leverage cloud computing nodes.

### User Interface Attacks
The attack we describe exploits vulnerabilities in user interfaces that fail to convey important security-relevant information. Such attacks have been known since the early days of multi-user computing, where mechanisms like secure attention sequences (e.g., CTRL-ALT-DELETE) were introduced to establish a trusted path between the user and the operating system.

Our attack bears resemblance to web browser attacks, where users make trust decisions based on the reputation of a domain or network name. Homograph attacks [19] have been used to trick users into visiting a site with a similar-appearing domain name by exploiting similarities between glyphs in a character set (e.g., paypa1.com vs. paypal.com). In the context of wireless SSIDs, the lack of delimiters allows for the use of invisible and non-printable characters, further enhancing the deception.

Subverting the SSL/TLS PKI infrastructure, which is relied upon by HTTPS to verify the authenticity of web servers, is another class of web security attacks. Recent issues, such as the questionable trustworthiness of some certificate authorities [14, 16], have led to the issuance of malicious but correctly signed certificates. Another interesting attack involves browser URL spoofing by injecting null bytes in the certificate common name field [30].

### Conclusions
This paper presents a novel wireless attack against WPA Enterprise networks. The key insight behind our attack is the combination of cross-layer capabilities, such as stealthy jamming using software radios, the inadequacy of wireless user interface mechanisms in popular commodity operating systems, and the insecure trust model used in wireless authentication. Our user experiments demonstrate that the attack is highly effective and very difficult for victims to detect. We highlight significant deficiencies in wireless management user interfaces for commodity operating systems and the weak binding between wireless network SSIDs and authentication server certificates. We also describe a prototype implementation of the attack, analyze its effectiveness and cost, and discuss potential countermeasures.
