### Vulnerable Libraries

- **Distribution of Vulnerable Libraries:**
  - 37.8% of ALEXA sites use at least one vulnerable library version.
  - 9.7% of ALEXA sites use two or more different vulnerable library versions.
  - 37.4% of COM sites use at least one vulnerable library version.
  - 4.1% of COM sites use two or more different vulnerable library versions.

- **Vulnerability Rate by Alexa Rank:**
  - 21% of the Top 100 websites use a known vulnerable library.
  - 32.2% of the Top 1k websites use a known vulnerable library.
  - The overall average for all 75k websites is 37.8%.

- **Vulnerability Rate by Category:**
  - Financial and governmental websites: 52% and 50% vulnerable, respectively.
  - Malicious websites: Same proportion as the full dataset.
  - Parked and adult sites: 24% and 19% vulnerable, respectively.

### Risk Factors for Vulnerability

- **Hosting Method:**
  - Inline inclusions of jQuery have a higher fraction of vulnerable versions compared to internally or externally hosted copies.
  - Direct inclusions by the main document are less likely to be vulnerable than indirect inclusions.

- **WordPress-Related Inclusions:**
  - WordPress-related inclusions appear to be slightly more up-to-date than unrelated inclusions.

- **Ad, Widget, or Tracker Code:**
  - Inclusions by ad, widget, or tracker code are more vulnerable, especially in COM where the vulnerability rate for jQuery is 89%, almost double the rate of unrelated inclusions.
