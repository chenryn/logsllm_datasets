pixels for seemingly no reason.

**Additional Information**  
This is quite similar to an issue that was close last year in #8728 , I don't
know if they're related but looking at the changes made could be of use. As I
understand it there is also a good chance that this is an upstream issue, if
so is there any way I might generate support for that being fixed?
