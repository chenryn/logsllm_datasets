User: Everything seems to be only available in self-extracting .exe. My company blocks executable files from being downloaded.
Assistant: If it's a "self-extracting" zip file you can just change the .exe extension to .zip and then unzip it with any standard zip file handling utility...assuming you can at least download .exe files. If you can't, you might be able to rename them during the download process (i.e. via a "Save As" dialog).
