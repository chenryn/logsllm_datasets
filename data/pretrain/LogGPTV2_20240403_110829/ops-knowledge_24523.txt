If the files are only available as self-extracting .exe files, and your company blocks the download of executable files, you can try the following workaround:

1. **Rename the File Extension**: If you are able to download the .exe file, you can rename the file extension from `.exe` to `.zip`. For example, change `file.exe` to `file.zip`.

2. **Extract the File**: Once renamed, you can use any standard zip utility (such as 7-Zip or WinZip) to extract the contents of the file.

3. **Download with a Different Extension**: If your company's security policies prevent you from downloading .exe files at all, you may be able to rename the file during the download process. Look for a "Save As" option in your browser's download dialog and manually change the file extension to `.zip` before saving it.

This should allow you to access the contents of the self-extracting .exe file without violating your company's security policies.
