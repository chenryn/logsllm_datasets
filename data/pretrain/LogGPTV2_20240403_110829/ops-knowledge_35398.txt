Question: A security analyst observes an unusual spike in outbound network traffic on a corporate network. This traffic is characterized by a constant stream of data packets being sent to an external IP address that is not recognized as part of the company's regular traffic patterns. Upon further investigation, the analyst discovers that a process associated with a recent collection of sensitive documents is responsible for this traffic. What detection strategy should the analyst employ to identify the potential automated exfiltration of data?
"A": "Monitor for changes in file access patterns, particularly for sensitive documents, to identify automated processing after collection.",
"B": "Implement script execution monitoring to identify suspicious scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions.",
"C": "Review executed commands and arguments that may indicate data exfiltration through automated processing after collection.",
"D": "Analyze email traffic logs for phishing attempts that could initiate the exfiltration process."
Answer: AC
