User: How to perform code static analysis? What tools and techniques are available?
Assistant: Code static analysis is a technique for finding potential problems and bugs by analyzing the code itself rather than runtime data. The following are some tools and techniques for code static analysis: 1. Static analysis tools: SonarQube, Pylint, ESLint, FindBugs, Checkstyle, Coverity, etc. 2. Static code analysis techniques: abstract syntax tree (AST), data flow analysis, symbols Execution, model checking, etc. 3. Application scenarios: code refactoring, code review, code quality analysis, security vulnerability scanning, etc. 4. Practical plan: choose the language suitable for the project, adjust the analysis rules, integrate into the CI/CD process, and use it step by step from small to large, from simple to complex. It should be noted that static analysis tools and technologies are only used as auxiliary means in the end, and some unconventional code problems still need manual inspection and repair.
