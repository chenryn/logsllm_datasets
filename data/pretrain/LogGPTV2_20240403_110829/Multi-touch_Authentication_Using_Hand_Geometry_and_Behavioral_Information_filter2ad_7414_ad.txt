### Section VII-C: Effect of Feature Subsets and Classifiers

#### B. Impact of Feature Subsets and Classifiers
In Section III-B, we defined physiological and behavioral features to characterize TFST gestures. Through feature selection, we identified four distinct feature subsets:
1. **Physiological Subset**: Features related to hand geometry.
2. **Behavioral Subset**: Features related to the gesture dynamics.
3. **Whole Set**: A combination of all features from the physiological and behavioral subsets.
4. **Selected Subset**: Features from the whole set that have a Fisher Score greater than 0.5.

In this experiment, we investigated the impact of these feature subsets and different classifiers on the authentication performance of the 4-finger L swipe gesture. We used one-class SVM and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers with the four feature subsets as inputs.

**Classifier Parameter Selection:**
- For KNN, we performed multiple tests with \( k \) ranging from 1 to 20 and selected \( k = 3 \) based on the best performance.
- For SVM, we compared linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid kernels and chose the RBF kernel, which provided the highest average classification accuracy. The SVM parameters \( C \) and \( \gamma \) (using LibSVM [30]) were set to 0.05 and 0.015, respectively.

**Training and Testing Setup:**
- The training set size was fixed at 30 samples. Subjects with at least 30 samples were designated as legitimate users.
- For each legitimate user, the other 160 subjects were treated as imposters.
- Figure 6 shows the ROC curves for the four feature subsets using both classifiers.

**Results and Observations:**
- As shown in Figure 6, the authentication accuracies for the physiological subset (1), whole set (3), and selected subset (4) are significantly higher than those for the behavioral subset (2). This suggests that incorporating hand geometry information into multi-touch authentication significantly improves performance over a purely behavior-based approach.
- The selected subset outperformed the other feature subsets, indicating that the Fisher Score is an effective method for fusing physiological and behavioral features.
- The combined feature set performs better than individual feature sets, supporting our assumption that behavioral features can complement physiological features, especially in cases where measurement errors arise from behavioral variances.

**Comparison of Classifiers:**
- We used McNemarâ€™s test to compare the performance of the classifiers, setting the significance level \( \alpha \) to 0.05.
- Table IV shows that in 126 cases, 3-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) outperformed SVM, while in 6 cases, SVM performed better. In 12 cases, there was no significant difference.
- The superior performance of KNN may be attributed to the small training set size, which makes it difficult for SVM to adequately model the complex profile of positive samples. KNN, using Manhattan distance, builds a more reasonable boundary to distinguish positive and negative samples.

### C. Impact of Training Set Size
In the previous experiment, we used 30 samples per subject for training. Here, we investigate the effect of varying training set sizes on authentication performance.

**Experimental Setup:**
- We used 3-Nearest Neighbor as the one-class classifier, with input features set to the physiological subset, behavioral subset, and selected subset.
- The training set size was varied from 5 to 100, initially in steps of 5 and then in steps of 10, to evaluate the impact on 4-finger L swipe authentication.
- Figure 7 plots the average EERs against different training set sizes.

**Results and Observations:**
- The size of the training set significantly affects authentication performance. For all three feature subsets, the average EER decreases with more training data, as larger training sets provide more information and more accurate characterization of the legitimate user.
- The physiological and selected feature subsets exhibited steeper learning curves, indicating that their feature spaces are more compact, leading to better learning with fewer samples.
- The selected feature subset showed the best learning performance, with the final EER dropping to 1/3 of the initial value (from 5.84% to 1.88%) with sufficient training.
- With only 5 training samples, the selected feature subset achieved an EER of 5.84%, compared to 18.21% for the behavioral subset and 7.91% for the physiological subset, demonstrating the effectiveness of feature fusion for multi-touch authentication.

**Additional Experiment:**
- In Section VII-A, we also examined the effect of different training set sizes on the authentication performance of various TFST gestures. From Figure 7, a simple 3-finger TFST L swipe achieved an EER of 9.32% with 5 training samples and 4.10% with adequate training, suggesting that 3-finger TFST gestures may provide a relatively secure authentication method for small-screen devices like smartphones.

### D. Behavioral Variability
Behavioral variability is a critical issue for behavioral biometric techniques. This experiment focuses on long-term behavioral variability and its impact on multi-touch authentication.

**Data Collection:**
- Data collection was divided into 6 sessions over approximately 2 months, with sessions separated by more than a week. Each subject participated in every session, allowing us to record long-term variations in touching behaviors.
- Training and testing datasets were organized according to sessions to study the impact of behavioral variability over time.

**Experimental Setup:**
- For each EER calculation, we used 5 samples from the first session for training and all samples from subsequent sessions for legitimate testing. Imposter samples were taken from all other subjects across all sessions.
- We used 3-Nearest Neighbor as the one-class classifier with the physiological, behavioral, and selected feature subsets for the 4-finger TFST L swipe gesture.
- The experiment was repeated 10 times for each subject to account for randomness.

**Results and Observations:**
- Figure 8 shows the average EERs for different feature subsets over different sessions.
- The EERs for the physiological and selected feature subsets remained relatively constant, with slight increases from 6.38% to 7.51% for the physiological subset and from 4.46% to 5.58% for the selected subset.
- The EERs for the behavioral subset increased more significantly, from 13.39% to 22.14%, indicating that physiological features are more robust to long-term behavioral variability.
- The selected combined features again showed the best performance, demonstrating that the fusion of behavioral and hand geometry features not only reduces EER levels but also enhances resistance to behavioral variability over time.

### VIII. Security Analysis
In this section, we examine the security of the proposed method based on the threat model presented in Section II. We conduct an experimental study to assess the security of TFST gesture authentication against zero-effort attacks, smudge attacks, shoulder surfing attacks, and statistical attacks.

#### A. Zero-effort Attack
A zero-effort attack is a common type of attack where the attacker guesses the secret or tries the authentication procedure without much knowledge of how a legitimate user enters the system. For TFST gesture authentication, we assume a zero-effort attacker knows which gesture to perform but has no other information.

**Experimental Setup:**
- In Section VII, we evaluated the resilience of TFST gesture authentication to zero-effort attacks by designating one subject as the legitimate user and the other 160 subjects as impostors.
- To further investigate the impact of handshape similarity, we selected user pairs with similar handshapes using a similarity metric, \( Sim_{ij} \), based on recorded hand images in our dataset.

**Results and Observations:**
- The results demonstrated the general resilience of TFST gesture authentication to zero-effort attacks.
- Hand geometry information is crucial in TFST gesture authentication, and the inclusion of handshape similarity in the analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of the system's security.
