# Correlation Example
**Open Source Security Information Management (OSSIM) - 2004/02/01**

## 4. Conclusion
This paper aims to illustrate the power and flexibility of a key component of the OSSIM correlation engine. There are many additional aspects to discuss, such as the actions taken when a directive is matched, the behavior upon a directive timeout, and the specific roles of priority and reliability. These topics will be covered in the final correlation paper.

We are currently revising the syntax and plan to introduce standard functions that can be used within directives. Examples include responses to window attacks with unusual behavior and attack responses during established sessions. These enhancements should significantly reduce the length of directives, potentially by 75%, as 80% of their current content is repetitive.

The development is ongoing, and some changes are likely. We have numerous ideas for improving both functionality and user-ficiency. Sharing this early work allows us to gather valuable real-world input. We welcome any feedback, criticisms, or questions you may have.

## Appendix B – Complete Directive
Finally, here is the completed sample directive. You can also download it from [http://www.ossim.net](http://www.ossim.net):

```plaintext
[Directive Example]
# Description: Sample directive for established session
# Plugin: 1108
# Priority: High
# Reliability: 80

# Conditions
if (session_established AND attack_detected) {
    # Actions
    log_event("Attack detected on established session");
    alert_admin("Immediate action required: Attack on established session");
}
```
