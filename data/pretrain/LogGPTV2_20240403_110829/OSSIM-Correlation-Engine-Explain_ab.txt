4. Conclusion
Hopefully this paper shows a little bit of the power and flexibility of one part of the ossim correlation engine.There is much more to write about all this because nothing is said about what happens when a directive is matched, what happens when a directive times out, what happens exactly with the priority and reliability but don’t worry, that will all be included in the final correlation paper.The syntax is also being rewritten and we want to provide some standard functions that can be used with directives, such as windows attack response with odd behaviour, attack response with established session and so on. This should make the directives much shorter, maybe 1/4 from what they’re now because 80% is repetitive.Everything is work in progress and probably some things will change. We have lots of ideas for improvements, both in functionality as in ease of use but I think it’s a good idea to show some early work in order to expect real worl input.
So, any ideas, critics, flames, etc... are welcome and if you have questions just ask them.
