### Section: Properties of Dependent Disruptions

In this section, we examine various properties of dependent disruptions. For certain properties, we conduct additional analyses on specific Internet Service Providers (ISPs) within the Thunderping dataset: Comcast (cable), Qwest (DSL), and Viasat (satellite). These ISPs are frequently pinged by Thunderping, and we were able to detect over a thousand dependent disruption events for each: 3,109 for Comcast, 1,855 for Viasat, and 1,734 for Qwest. Additional details on per-ISP dependent disruption events are provided in the appendix.

- **(b) Qwest**
- **(c) Viasat**

**Figure 3** shows the number of dependent disruption events that began in each hour of the week. The x-axis labels 'Mon' at the bottom refer to midnight on Monday in UTC time, while the top x-axis labels 'Mon' refer to midnight at UTC-6 (CST).

### 4.1 Frequency of Dependent Disruptions at Night for Some ISPs

Richter et al. [19] have recently demonstrated that disruptions tend to occur more frequently during maintenance intervals close to midnight local time. They used proprietary data from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) collected at hourly granularity. Here, we investigate whether our technique can identify similar patterns.

**Figure 3** illustrates that individual ISPs exhibit different behaviors. Comcast and Viasat show a higher frequency of dependent disruption events around midnight CST on weekdays. In contrast, Qwest does not display a clear pattern. Our findings align with those of prior work [19], validating our technique. Additionally, we achieve these results using public (Thunderping) data and a finer granularity of every 11 minutes.

### 4.2 Correlated Recovery of Dependent Disruptions

We next explore whether dependent disruption events are accompanied by correlated recovery. Since Thunderping continues to probe an IP address even after it becomes unresponsive (up to six hours after the end of a weather alert [21]), it can observe when the address becomes responsive again, indicating the end of the disruption. Multiple addresses that experience both disruption and recovery together provide evidence that the event was indeed dependent and allow us to estimate the duration of the disruption.

Most dependent disruptions also exhibit correlated recoveries. Out of 20,831 dependent disruption events, 6,869 (33%) had all disrupted addresses recover within the same 11-minute time-bin. Furthermore, 14,789 (71%) disruption events had at least half of the disrupted addresses recover together. Across all 20,831 dependent disruption events, there were 229,413 observed disrupted addresses. Of these, 121,648 (53%) disrupted addresses from 15,117 (73%) disruption events showed a dependent recovery with other addresses in the same group, indicating that dependent recovery is common.

#### Figure 4: Duration of Correlated Disruptions and Recoveries
- **(a) Distribution of durations of dependent disruptions for all addresses that recovered in a correlated manner.**
- **(b) Number of addresses that recovered and the corresponding recovery duration for events where at least two addresses recovered.**

**Figure 4(a)** shows that 60% of recovered addresses recovered in less than an hour. Our technique can identify this because we operate at the precision of 11-minute time-bins. In contrast, recent work that identifies disruptions spanning an entire calendar hour [19] would miss these shorter disruptions.

**Figure 4(b)** demonstrates that even dependent disruptions involving hundreds of addresses often last less than an hour, suggesting that short recovery durations are not solely due to small disruption events.

### 4.3 Multi-ISP Dependent Disruptions

Dependent disruption events can span multiple ISPs within a single state, indicating a shared infrastructure fault. We broaden our analysis to examine whether dependent disruption events are correlated across multiple ISPs within the same state.

We observed 333 instances where multiple ISPs in the same state experienced simultaneous dependent disruption events. Many of these occurred on days with reported large power outages. **Figure 5** shows the distribution of multi-ISP dependent disruption events over the year 2017, with 88 (26%) of the 333 instances occurring on a single day during Hurricane Irma (September 11).

**Figure 6** provides a detailed view of multi-ISP events during Hurricane Irma in Florida (FL), Georgia (GA), and South Carolina (SC). Of the 111 events, 15 affected three ISPs simultaneously, and 96 affected two.

### 4.4 Partial Disruptions in /24 Address Blocks

We investigate whether dependent disruption events affect entire /24 address blocks. If they do, they would likely be detected by prior work that looks for outages at these granularities [18, 19]. However, if there are still responding addresses within a /24 block, prior work may miss the disruption.

To analyze the impact on /24 address blocks, we group all addresses in the observed disrupted group by /24s. For example, consider a dependent disruption event involving 3 addresses in 1.2.3.0/24, 5 addresses in 2.3.4.0/24, and 2 addresses in 4.5.6.0/24. We call these the observed disrupted /24s. For each /24, we also find how many addresses were pinged by Thunderping and continued to respond for at least 30 minutes after the dependent disruption occurred. These are termed responsive addresses.

Our goal is to determine how many /24 address blocks experience partial disruptions, where at least one address within the /24 was part of a dependent disruption but other addresses within the same /24 remained responsive. Out of 20,831 dependent disruption events, 12,825 (61%) had at least one responsive address in all observed disrupted /24s, indicating partial disruptions.

Next, we examine the subset of observed disrupted /24s with at least Dmin failures. This provides a minimum bound on the number of actual disrupted addresses. For instance, if Dmin is 3, we find a minimum bound of at least 1 actual disrupted address in 1.2.3.0/24, 3 in 2.3.4.0/24, and 0 in 4.5.6.0/24. Of 92,777 observed disrupted /24s, 14,702 (16%) had at least Dmin disrupted addresses.

**Figure 7** shows the minimum actual disrupted addresses in a /24 versus the responsive addresses in a /24 for all /24s with at least Dmin disrupted addresses.

#### Figure 7: Minimum Actual Disrupted Addresses vs. Responsive Addresses in /24
- **Minimum actual disrupted addresses in a /24 vs. responsive addresses in a /24.**

Many disrupted /24s with actual disrupted addresses have other addresses that remain responsive. 10,164 (69%) /24s had at least one responsive address, 9,327 (63%) had at least two, and 6,096 (41%) had at least 10. 1,691 /24s had at least 10 actual disrupted addresses; of those, 550 (33%) had at least 10 responsive addresses. The appendix provides further details on this behavior across ISPs and its implications for prior work.

### 5. Discussion and Conclusion

We developed a technique to detect dependent disruption events with high confidence using the binomial test. This technique is general enough to apply to any dataset of disruptions and was applied to the Thunderping dataset [21]. The dataset includes per-address disruption data from thousands of addresses in relatively small geographic regions, which may experience failures due to common underlying causes. The limitations of the Thunderping probing scheme—measuring residential addresses in the U.S., primarily during predicted severe weather, and with a minimum disruption duration of 11 minutes—are inherited by our method.
