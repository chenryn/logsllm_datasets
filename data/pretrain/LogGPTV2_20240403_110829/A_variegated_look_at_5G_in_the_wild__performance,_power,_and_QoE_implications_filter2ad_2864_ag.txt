Figure 24: [Verizon mmWave] UE’s downlink throughput
perceived using several Speedtest servers located in the
same state as that of UE (Minnesota). Using Verizon’s
own server located in the UE’s local city (Minneapolis)
achieves highest throughput. Others are affected by other
(e.g., Internet-side or server-side) factors, e.g., NIC/Switch-
Port capacity, network configurations and/or congestion.
Next, we try to understand how different Speedtest servers
located in the same state as that of UE (i.e., Minnesota) impact
throughput performance. Such bandwidth testing servers are typ-
ically hosted by ISPs, mobile operators, and academic organiza-
tions. Fig. 24 shows the UE’s downlink throughput (using multi-
ple connections) for all the servers. No doubt, the carrier’s own
hosted server (Verizon) provides the best throughput of over 3 Gbps.
Servers 2 to 23 also provide an impressive downlink throughput of
∼2.8 Gbps (i.e., 10% degradation over Verizon’s own server). This
is most likely due to the additional Internet side routing overhead
which also increases latency. We also find evidence that production
level Speedtest servers might actually not support throughput over
certain limits. For instance, we find servers 25 to 28 are bound by
2 Gbps, while servers 29 to 33 are bound by 1 Gbps. We believe
these bounds might either be due to NIC/switch-port limitations
or network configurations. In either case, with mmWave’s ultra-
high throughput capacity, servers should also have sufficient up-
link/downlink capacities to the Internet which can be challenging
due to increase in costs and/or infrastructure limitations.
A.3 RRC State Machine Parameters
We summarize a list of timers of RRC state transitions for different
networks/carriers/band configurations in Table 7. When the radio
is active and there are no incoming/outgoing packets, UE starts the
tail timer (i.e., UE-inactivity timer) and stays in RRC_CONNECTED

RRC-Probe for SA 5G, NSA 5G and 4G/LTE.
for 𝑇𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙 before demoting to RRC_IDLE. Discontinuous Reception
(DRX) is adopted by both 4G and 5G for power saving in which UE
periodically wakes up to check paging messages and rests for the
remaining time of the cycle. The periods in RRC_CONNECTED and
RRC_IDLE are different. 𝑇𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔_𝑑𝑟𝑥 is the cycle period of Long DRX
in RRC_CONNECTED and 𝑇𝑖𝑑𝑙𝑒_𝑑𝑟𝑥 is the cycle period of DRX in
RRC_IDLE. We do not observe and infer Short DRX cycle with RRC-
Probe due to its very small cycle period. We also calculate the delay
for promotion from RRC_IDLE to 4G and 5G which is 𝑇4𝑔_𝑝𝑟𝑜 and
𝑇5𝑔_𝑝𝑟𝑜 respectively. Fig. 25 shows the results of the different RRC
states inferred using RRC-Probe for all the configurations. Note,
we observe that in NSA, sometimes the packets might arrive over
4G interface (with higher latency) while other times packets might
arrive over 5G interface (with lower latency). This can be seen for
the NSA low-band 5G setting for both Verizon and T-Mobile carriers.
We have therefore also mentioned a second tail-timer for such
settings (see timers in brackets in Table 7). Although not shown,
for 4G → 5G promotion in NSA 5G, UE will first promote to 4G’s
CONNECTED state before switching to 5G (i.e., LTE_RRC_IDLE →
LTE_RRC_CONNECTED → NR_RRC_CONNECTED). In SA 5G though,
the UE will directly directly reach NR_RRC_CONNECTED.

software (API) and hardware (Monsoon) approaches and calculate
the average relative errors between the two approaches. The results
are shown in Table 9. The software monitor always underestimates
the UE power but a higher sampling rate may reduce the error.
A.6 Summary of Artifacts
The GitHub repository mentioned below contains the artifacts
(dataset and tools) associated with the paper:
https://github.com/SIGCOMM21-5G/artifact
This is a measurement paper with several types of experiments
conducted for different purposes having different methodologies.
To help quickly navigate and have the ability to understand the
different pieces, we have created different folders for different ex-
periments. There are README files within each folder that provide
instructions on validating the experiment-specific artifacts. At the
very top of the README instructions, we also specify which re-
sults/plots the folder is corresponds to. Lastly, here are some generic
principles we followed for releasing the artifacts:
A.6.1 Dataset Size.
(1) If the dataset is small enough, we included the dataset file in
the repository itself.
(2) If the dataset files are huge, we use a small sample of the
dataset in the repository to demonstrate the functionality.
(3) You can replace the small subset with the full dataset. The
full dataset is provided in the experiment-specific README
file. In either case, we provide full processed results as well.
A.6.2 Data Analysis, Model/Plot Generation.
(1) If data analysis is involved, our instructions will contain
information on how to process the data.
(2) No matter what the dataset size is, we provide the fully gen-
erated results and/or plots. If you decide to run the analysis
and/or plotting scripts, the outcome of processing will re-
place the existing files in the repository.
(3) For the artifacts involved in §5 (ABR video streaming), exten-
sive computation resources are required. We have therefore
provide a screencast to show how the results were generated.
If one can arrange their own compute resources, we provide
instructions on how to setup the system and evaluate.

ing authors: PI:EMAIL, xumiao@umich.edu.

S20U in Minneapolis (MN), we also conduct the same set of experi-
ments using S10 smartphones in Ann Arbor (MI), which have rela-
tively older 5G modems and chipsets. Fig. 26 shows the throughput-
power relationship of mmWave 5G and 4G for both downlink and
uplink data transfer at controlled throughput target levels. For the
downlink and uplink transfer, we echo the observations made ear-
lier in §4.3 that mmWave 5G uses more power than 4G/LTE at low
throughput levels, but mmWave becomes more efficient at higher
throughput levels. The throughput-energy efficiency results are
shown in Fig. 27. Besides, as reported in [24], we also find that
the power consumption across different UE models can be differ-
ent. For example, the crossover points between mmWave 5G and
4G/LTE observed using S10 are different from those measured using
S20U. Nonetheless, the crossover points between S10 and S20U are
reasonably close to each other.

Downlink vs. Uplink. We also compare the downlink transfer
with uplink transfer for 4G and 5G. From the results seen in Figs. 11
and 26, we derive the slopes of throughput-power curves across
different device models and radio bands/technologies and list them
in Table 8 for different settings. From the results, we conclude that
uplink power increases 2.2× to 5.9× faster than downlink power
for both 5G and 4G, and downlink transfer is always more efficient
than uplink. This aligns with previous results on 3G/4G [31]. Un-
surprisingly, UE’s radio requires more power for sending data than
to receive [25]. We have quantitatively compared them between
state-of-the-art 5G and 4G commercial services.
