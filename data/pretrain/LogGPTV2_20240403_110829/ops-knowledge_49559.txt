User: I want to use the macports version of python instead of the one that comes with Leopard.
Assistant: Don't. Apple ships various system utilities that rely on the system Python (and particularly the Python "framework" build); removing it will cause you problems.
Instead, modify your PATH environ variable in your ~/.bash_profile to put /opt/local/bin first.
