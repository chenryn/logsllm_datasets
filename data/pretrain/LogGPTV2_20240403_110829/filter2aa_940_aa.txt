## What is Geo-IP Blocking?
Geo-IP blocking involves indiscriminately blocking entire sections of IP addresses related to specific geographical areas at your firewall or router.

### Spam Statistics
According to a recent study by SpamHaus (2005):
- USA: 42%
- South Korea: 13%
- China: 8%

Blocking these two countries alone would reduce spam by 21%.

## Why Use Geo-IP Blocking?
- **Quick Implementation:** Can be set up within minutes.
- **Cost-Effective:** Only requires entries in a router.
- **Comprehensive Protection:** Avoids almost all types of attacks, including zero-day and unreported exploits from the blocked countries.
- **Easily Reversible:** Changes can be quickly undone.
- **Outbound Access:** Users can still access blocked sites outbound.
- **Selective Access:** Most companies do not need to give the entire world access to their network.
- **Applicability:** Even Fortune 500 companies can use this for parts of their network.

### Additional Reasons to Use Geo-IP Blocking
- **Long-Term Effectiveness:** As more spam and malware moves offshore, Geo-IP blocking may become more effective.
- **Pressure on "Bad Actor" Countries:** May force countries to crack down on spam and malware (e.g., China recently announced a crackdown on spam due to pressure from ISPs).

## Types of Malware Geo-IP Can Stop
- Spam
- Email Fraud
- Phishing
- Viruses
- Worms
- Automated Hacking Tools
- Manual Hacking (script kiddies)
- Prohibited Websites Hosted Offshore (porn, gambling, etc.)

## Reasons Not to Use Geo-IP Blocking
- **Not 100% Effective:** No security measure is perfect.
- **Global Access:** Goes against the idea of global internet access.
- **Multinational Corporations:** Large corporations with global operations may face challenges.
- **Overseas Business:** Companies doing business overseas may need to maintain open communication channels.
- **Email Blockage:** Will block all emails from the blocked regions unless exceptions are made.

## How Geo-IP Blocking Works
- **IANA Assignments:** The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns address blocks to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) for local assignment.
- **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs):**
  - ARIN (North America)
  - APNIC (Asia)
  - RIPE (Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia)
  - LACNIC (Latin America)
  - AfriNIC (Africa)

### APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre)
- Covers many "bad actor" countries (e.g., #2 and #3 spammers).
- Blocking APNIC could lower malware hits by 20-30%.
- Caution: Japan, where many Westerners do business, is also included.
