1. Prioritize secure cloud adoption + modernization investmentsa. Accelerate secure cloud & app modernization 	increases productivity and reduce risk b. Normalize preventive maintenance for security 	reduces downtime & disruption risk
2. Help protect business critical assets and processes
a. Identify business critical systems 	Ensures teams know the top priorities b. Sponsor + participate in Cybersecurity BC/DR exercises 	Reduces impact of real incidents & extortion/ransomware3. Shift security accountability and oversight to business owners
| a. Prepare business owners for security risk Owners need security context + expertise to make good decisions | a.

Just as preventive maintenance on corporate fleet vehicles can help avoid costly breakdowns, patching should be viewed as a normal and necessary part of reliably achieving the organization’s missions.If an organization needs a particular technology to support its mission, it also needs to maintain that technology throughout its life cycle – and that includes patching.

Security Posture Management 
• Measure and Report Risk across all sources:• Software vulnerabilities – Operating System (OS), 	app, middleware, etc. 
	• Configuration – OS, networks, apps, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, 	Containers, Low-code apps, and more
	• Operation – processes and practices that create risk 	(e.g. overuse of privileged accounts, entitlements, etc.)• Mitigate Risk by enabling teams - Proactively work with 	IT operations and DevOps teams to assist withremediation (expertise, planning, tooling, education, etc.)

Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)
1. Start with Cloud Infrastructure (via CSPM)
• Tooling - Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for VMs, Containers, Databases, etc. (e.g. Defender for Cloud)• Process - Build shared responsibility model between teams + enablement processes for IT/Dev Ops teams• Configuration Baseline – start with vendor/industry recommendations (ASB, M365 Secure Score, CIS Benchmark for AWS, etc.)
2. Extend CSPM to all clouds and on-premises datacenters
