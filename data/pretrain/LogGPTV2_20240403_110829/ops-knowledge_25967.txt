User: If I use M-x shell and run the interactive Python interpreter, Emacs on Windows does not return any IO.
When I discovered M-x python-shell, I regained hope.  However, instead of running the interactive Python shell, I want to run a specific Python script that features an interactive CLI.  (See Python's cmd module for details).
Is there a way of launching a Python script in Emacs that is interactive? (stdout, stdin, stderr)
Assistant: You can run python in interactive mode by typing python.exe -i 
Alternatively, you can download ipython and just run ipython.exe
