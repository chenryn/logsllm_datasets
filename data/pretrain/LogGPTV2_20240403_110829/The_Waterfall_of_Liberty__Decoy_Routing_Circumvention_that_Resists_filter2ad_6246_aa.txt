## Abstract
Decoy routing is an emerging approach for circumventing internet censorship, leveraging volunteer Internet autonomous systems (ASes) known as decoy ASes. Recent studies have identified a fundamental vulnerability in decoy routing systems: censors can re-route traffic around decoy ASes, thereby preventing censored users from using these systems. In this paper, we introduce a new architecture for decoy routing that significantly enhances resistance to such rerouting attacks. Our design, called downstream-only decoy routing, operates decoy routers only on the downstream traffic of censored users, thus reducing the censors' ability to manipulate BGP routes. Through Internet-scale BGP simulations, we demonstrate that our approach provides substantially stronger resistance to rerouting attacks. We also present the first implementation of a downstream-only decoy routing system, named Waterfall, which incorporates unique covert communication mechanisms and is resistant to traffic analysis attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Internet censorship remains a significant threat to freedom of speech, ideas, and information. Repressive regimes and totalitarian governments employ various techniques, including IP address filtering, DNS interference, and deep-packet inspection, to enforce censorship. To counteract this, numerous circumvention systems have been developed by academics and practitioners. Decoy routing, an emerging approach, differs from traditional systems like Tor, VPNs, and Psiphon by implementing circumvention software on the Internet routers of volunteer ASes, making it inherently resistant to IP address blocking.

However, existing decoy routing systems are vulnerable to routing attacks, particularly the "routing around decoys" (RAD) attack, where censors manipulate BGP routes to bypass decoy ASes. This paper challenges the notion that RAD is a fundamental weakness of decoy routing by proposing a new architecture: downstream-only decoy routing. This approach operates decoy routers solely on the downstream traffic of censored users, enhancing resistance to rerouting attacks. Our Internet-scale BGP simulations show that downstream-only decoy routing is significantly more resilient to such attacks. For example, a single decoy AS in our Waterfall system can provide the same level of resistance to Chinese censors as a traditional system with 53 decoy ASes.

Designing a downstream-only decoy routing system is a challenging engineering problem, as it requires novel methods for upstream covert communication. We introduce Waterfall, the first downstream-only decoy routing system, which uses HTTP redirection and other techniques to enable real-time upstream covert communication. Additionally, Waterfall is designed to resist traffic analysis attacks. A fully functional prototype of Waterfall is publicly available.

### Main Contributions
1. **Novel Architecture**: We propose a new decoy routing architecture, downstream-only decoy routing, which provides superior resistance to routing attacks compared to traditional systems.
2. **Engineering Design**: We design and implement the first downstream-only decoy routing system, Waterfall, using innovative covert communication techniques.
3. **Prototype Implementation**: We have built a fully functional prototype of Waterfall, which is publicly available online.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Major Censorship Circumvention Systems
Traditional circumvention systems, such as Tor, VPNs, and Psiphon, use proxy servers outside censored regions to relay traffic. These systems are vulnerable to IP address blocking once the censors identify the proxies. Domain fronting and CDNBrowsing are newer approaches that aim to resist IP address filtering, but they come with their own limitations, such as high costs and limited applicability.

### 2.2 Decoy Routing Circumvention Approach
Decoy routing leverages volunteer ASes to modify routers, enabling them to deflect censored users' traffic to blocked destinations. This approach defeats IP address blocking, a common method used to disable traditional proxy-based systems. Decoy routing systems typically require both upstream and downstream covert communication channels to function.

### 2.3 Existing Decoy Routing Designs
Table 1 compares major decoy routing systems, including our Waterfall system. All previous designs use TLS records for covert communication, embedding messages into overt TLS connections. More recent designs, such as Slitheen, use sophisticated TLS record replacement to enhance unobservability.

## 3. Conclusion
Downstream-only decoy routing represents a significant step forward in making decoy routing systems practical and resistant to rerouting attacks. By requiring fewer volunteer ASes and providing robust resistance, our Waterfall system offers a promising solution for circumventing internet censorship.
