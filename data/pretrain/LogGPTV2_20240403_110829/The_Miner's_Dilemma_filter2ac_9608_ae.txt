that when considering only sabotage attacks there are regions
where no-attack is the best strategy. The miner’s dilemma is
therefore not manifested in that model.
Pool competition for miners is an incentive in and of its
own for mutual attacks, and a pool may therefore choose
to perform block withholding even if its revenue would
increase only after the next difﬁcult adjustment. The two
models are therefore complimentary; the analysis of their
combination is left for future work.
2) Pool Fees: We assumed in our analysis that pools do
not charge fees from their members since such fees are
typically nominal (0 – 3% of a pool’s revenue [39]). The
model can be extended to include pools fees. Fees would add
a friction element to the ﬂow of revenue among inﬁltrated
and inﬁltrating pools. Speciﬁcally, Equation 4 would change
to take into account a pool fee of f
(cid:2)p
(cid:2)p
j=1 xi,j(t)(1 − f )rj(t)
mi +
j=1 xj,i(t)
Ri(t) +
ri(t) =
.
(21)
A pool with a fee of f is a less attractive target for
block withholding, since the attacker’s revenue is reduced
by f. However it is also less attractive for miners in general.
Trading off the two for best protection is left for future work,
as part of the treatment of the miner-pool interplay.
X. RELATED WORK
A. The Block Withholding Attack
The danger of a block withholding attack is as old as
Bitcoin pools. The attack was described by Rosenfeld [10] as
early as 2011, as pools were becoming a dominant player in
the Bitcoin world. The paper described the standard attack,
used by a miner to sabotage a pool at the cost of reducing
its own revenue. A more general view of fairness in proof
of work schemes was discussed in 2002 by Adam Back [40]
in the context of the HashCash system [41]. Early work did
not address the possibility of pools inﬁltrating other pools
for block withholding.
In concurrent work, Luu et al. [35] experimentally demon-
strate that block withholding can increase the attacker’s
revenue. They do not address the question of mutual attacks.
Courtois and Bahack [42] have recently noted that a pool
can increase its overall revenue with block withholding if all
other mining is performed by honest pools. We consider the
general case where not all mining is performed through pub-
lic pools, and analyze situations where pools can attack one
another. The discrepancy between the calculations of [42]
and our results for the special case analyzed there can be
explained by the strong approximations in that work. For
example, we calculate exactly how inﬁltrating miners reduce
the revenue density of the inﬁltrated pool.
B. Temporary Block Withholding
In the Block withholding attack discussed in this work the
withheld blocks are never published. However, blocks can
be withheld temporarily, not following the Bitcoin protocol,
to improve an attacker’s revenue.
A miner or a pool can perform a selﬁsh mining attack [23].
With selﬁsh mining the attacker increases its revenue by
temporarily withholding its blocks and publishing them in
response to block publication by other pools and miners.

This attack is independent of the block withholding attack
we discuss here and the two can be performed in concert.
An attacker can also perform a double spending attack
as follows [10]. He intentionally generates two conﬂicting
transactions, places one in a block it withholds, and pub-
lishes the other transaction. After the recipient sees the pub-
lished transaction, the attacker publishes the withheld block
to revoke the former transaction. This attack is performed by
miners or pools against service providers that accept Bitcoin,
and it not directly related to this work.
C. Block Withholding Defense
Most crypto-currencies use a proof-of-work architecture
similar to Bitcoin, where ﬁnding proof of work is the result
of solution guessing and checking. All of the algorithms we
are aware of are susceptible to the block withholding attack,
as in all of them the miner can check whether she found
a full or a partial proof of work. Prominent examples are
Litecoin [5], Dogecoin [6] and Permacoin [7].
It is possible to use an alternative proof of work mech-
anism in which miners would not be able to distinguish
partial from full proofs of work [40], [10], [43]. Such
a solution could reduce or remove the danger of block
withholding. However, making such a change may not be
in the interest of the community: Pool block withholding,
or even its potential, could lead to a reduction of pool sizes,
as explained in Section IX-A.
D. Decentralized Pools
Although most pools use a centralized manager, a promi-
nent exception is P2Pool – a distributed pool architecture
with no central manager [19]. But the question of whether a
pool is run by a centralized manager or with a decentralized
architecture is almost immaterial for the attack we describe.
An open P2Pool group can be inﬁltrated and attacked, and
the P2Pool code can be changed to support attacks against
other pools.
On the other hand, P2Pool can be used by groups of
miners to easily form closed pools. These do not accept
untrusted miners, and are therefore protected against block
withholding.
XI. CONCLUSION
We explored a block withholding attack among Bitcoin
mining pools — an attack that is possible in any similar
system that rewards for proof of work. Such systems are
gaining popularity, running most digital currencies and re-
lated services.
We observe that no-pool-attacks is not a Nash equilibrium:
If none of the other pools attack, a pool can increase its
revenue by attacking the others.
When two pools can attack each other, they face a version
of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. If one pool chooses to attack, the
victim’s revenue is reduced, and it can retaliate by attacking
and increase its revenue. However, when both attack, at Nash
equilibrium both earn less than they would have if neither
attacked. With multiple pools of equal size a similar situation
arises with a symmetric equilibrium.
The fact that block withholding is not common may be
explained by modeling the attack decisions as an iterative
prisoner’s dilemma. However, we argue that the situation
is unstable since the attack can be done anonymously.
Eventually, one pool may decide to increase its revenue and
drag the others to attack as well, ending with a reduced
revenue for all. The inferior revenue would push miners
to join private pools, which can verify that their registered
miners do not withhold blocks. This would lead to smaller
pools, and so ultimately to a better environment for Bitcoin
as a whole.
