|  this._changeTraceName(this._state, options.name);  
---|---  
That line needs an `await`.
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Link to the GitHub repository with the repro**
Unfortunately, I am having difficulty producing a minimal test case.  
I am seeing errors along the lines of:
> tracing.stop: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/playwright-
> artifacts-GZT396/0ff296554d68f4361c8d9ce7c529610f-pwnetcopy-1.network'
This happens when there's a test failure, and on per-describe `afterAll` I'm
calling (effectively) `_electron.launch().context().tracing.stop()`. This also
produces truncated trace zip files (which are unusable). Manually hacking the
installed `playwright-core` to add an `await` at the indicated position fixes
the issue.
While my repository is at https://github.com/mook-as/rd/ I doubt that will be
useful in reproducing the bug.
**Steps**
  * Run the test (`npm run test:e2e e2e/preferences.spec.ts` in my repo).
  * When it fails, try to use the produced trace file (`e2e/reports/*.zip` in my case) at https://trace.playwright.dev/
**Expected**
The trace zip file works correctly.
**Actual**
The trace zip file is truncated, because an exception was thrown in the middle
of writing it.
**Additional Information**
I'm not certain I can deal with the CLA, so I'm not producing a PR directly.
Sorry about that.
