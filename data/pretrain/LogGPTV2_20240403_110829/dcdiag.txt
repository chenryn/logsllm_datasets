Dcdiag
Applies To: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016
Dcdiag.exe analyzes the state of domain controllers in a forest or enterprise and reports any problems to help in troubleshooting.
Dcdiag.exe
As an end-user reporting program, dcdiag is a command-line tool that encapsulates detailed knowledge of how to identify abnormal behavior in the system. Dcdiag displays command output at the command prompt.
Dcdiag consists of a framework for executing tests and a series of tests to verify different functional areas of the system. This framework selects which domain controllers are tested according to scope directives from the user, such as enterprise, site, or single server.
To use dcdiag, you must run dcdiag from an elevated command prompt or PowerShell with administrative rights.
Dcdiag syntax
dcdiag [/s:] [/n:] [/u:\ /p:{* |  | ""}] [{/a | /e}] [{/q | /v}] [/i] [/f:] [/c [/skip:]] [/test:] [/fix] [{/h | /?}] [/ReplSource:]
dcdiag [/s:] [/n:] [/u:\ /p:{* |  | ""}] [{/a | /e}] [{/q | /v}] [/i] [/f:] [/c [/skip:]] [/test:] [/fix] [{/h | /?}] [/ReplSource:]
Dcdiag uses the following parameters:
Parameter
Description
/s:
Specifies the name of the server to run the command against. If this parameter isn't specified, the tests are run against the local domain controller.This parameter is ignored for DcPromo and RegisterInDns tests, which can only be run locally.
/n:
Uses NamingContext as the naming context to test. You can specify domains in NetBIOS, Domain Name System (DNS), or distinguished name format.
/u:\ /p:{ | ""}
Uses Domain\UserName. Dcdiag uses the current credentials of the user (or process) that is logged on. If alternate credentials are needed, use the following options to provide those credentials for binding with Password as the password: Use quotation marks ("") for an empty or null password. Use the wildcard character (*) to prompt for the password.
/a
Tests all the servers on this AD DS site.
/e
Tests all the servers in the enterprise. This overrides /a.
/q
Quiet. Prints only error messages.
/v
Verbose. Prints extended information.
/fix
Affects the MachineAccount test only. This parameter causes the test to fix the Service Principal Names (SPNs) on the Machine Account object of the domain controller.
/f:
Redirects all output to a log file.
/c
Comprehensive. Runs all tests except DCPromo and RegisterInDNS, including non-default tests. Optionally, you can use this parameter with the /skip parameter to skip specified tests.The following tests aren't run by default:Topology CutoffServersOutboundSecureChannels.
/h or /?
Displays help at the command prompt.
/test:
Runs this test only. The connectivity test, which you can't skip, is also run. This can't be used with /skip parameter.
/ReplSource:
Tests the connection between the domain controller on which you run the command and the source domain controller. (This parameter is used for the CheckSecurityError test.)SourceDomainController is the DNS name, NetBIOS name, or distinguished name of a real or potential server that will be the source domain controller for replication, as represented by a real or potential connection object.

Dcdiag default tests
The following table shows tests that run by default.
Test
Description
Advertising
Checks whether each domain controller advertises itself in the roles that it should be capable of performing. This test fails if the Netlogon Service has stopped or failed to start.
CheckSDRefDom
Checks that all application directory partitions have appropriate security descriptor reference domains.
CrossRefValidation
Checks the validity of cross-references.
FrsEvent
Checks to see if there are errors in the file replication system. Failing replication of the SysVol share can cause policy problems.
FrsSysVol
Checks that the file replication system and system volume are ready.
FSMOCheck
Checks that the domain controller can contact a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC), a time server, a preferred time server, a primary domain controller (PDC), and a global catalog server. This test doesn't test any of the servers for operations master roles.
Intersite
Checks for failures that would prevent or temporarily hold up intersite replication and predicts how long it would take for the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) to recover.
KccEvent
Checks that the KCC is completing without errors.
KnowsOfRoleHolders
Checks whether the domain controller can contact the servers that hold the five operations master roles (also known as flexible single master operations or FSMO roles).
MachineAccount
Checks whether the machine account has properly registered and that the services are advertised. Use the /RecreateMachineAccount parameter to attempt a repair if the local machine account is missing. Use the /FixMachineAccount parameter if the machine account flags are incorrect.
NCSecDesc
Checks that the security descriptors on the naming context heads have appropriate permissions for replication.
NetLogons
Checks that the appropriate logon privileges exist to allow replication to proceed.
ObjectsReplicated
Checks that the Machine Account and Directory System Agent (DSA) objects have replicated. You can use the /objectdn:dn parameter with the /n:nc parameter to specify an additional object to check.
OutboundSecureChannels
Checks that secure channels exist from all of the domain controllers in the domain to the domains that are specified by the /testdomain parameter. The /nositerestriction parameter prevents dcdiag from limiting the test to the domain controllers in the site.
Replications
Checks for timely replication and any replication errors between domain controllers.
RidManager
Checks whether the relative identifier (RID) master is accessible and if it contains the proper information.
Services
Checks whether the appropriate domain controller services are running.
SystemLog
Checks that the system is running without errors.
VerifyEnterpriseReferences
Checks that specified system references are intact for the FRS and replication infrastructure across all objects in the enterprise on each domain controller.
VerifyReferences
Checks that certain system references are intact for the FRS and replication infrastructure.
VerifyReplicas
Checks that all application directory partitions are fully instantiated on all replica servers.

Note
Connectivity checks on domain controllers that are  registered on the network and connect with other resources like DNS, LDAP, and RPC cannot be skipped.
DNS test syntax
dcdiag /test:DNS [/DnsBasic | /DnsForwarders | /DnsDelegation | /DnsDynamicUpdate | /DnsRecordRegistration | /DnsResolveExtName [/DnsInternetName:] | /DnsAll] [/f:] [/x:] [/xsl: or ] [/s:] [/e] [/v]
dcdiag /test:DNS [/DnsBasic | /DnsForwarders | /DnsDelegation | /DnsDynamicUpdate | /DnsRecordRegistration | /DnsResolveExtName [/DnsInternetName:] | /DnsAll] [/f:] [/x:] [/xsl: or ] [/s:] [/e] [/v]
DNS test uses the following parameters:
Parameter
Description
/test:DNS
Performs the specified DNS test. If no test is specified, defaults to /DnsAll.
/DnsBasic
Performs basic DNS tests, including network connectivity, DNS client configuration, service availability, and zone existence.
/DnsForwarders
Performs the /DnsBasic tests and also checks the configuration of forwarders.
/DnsDelegation
Performs the /DnsBasic tests and also checks for proper delegations.
/DnsDynamicUpdate
Performs /DnsBasic tests and also determines if dynamic update is enabled in the Active Directory zone.
/DnsRecordRegistration
Performs the /DnsBasic tests, and also checks if the address (A), canonical name (CNAME) and well-known service (SRV) resource records are registered. In addition, creates an inventory report based on the test results.
/DnsResolveExtName [/DnsInternetName:\]
Performs the /DnsBasic tests, and also attempts to resolve InternetName. If /DnsInternetName isn't specified, attempts to resolve the name www.microsoft.com. If /DnsInternetName is specified, attempts to resolve the Internet name supplied by the user.
/DnsAll
Performs all tests, except for the /DnsResolveExtName test, and generates a report.
/f:
Redirects all output to a log file.
/s:
Runs the tests against the domain controller. If this parameter isn't specified, the tests are run against the local domain controller.
/e
Runs all tests specified by /test:DNS against all domain controllers in the Active Directory forest.
/v
Verbose. Presents extended information about successful test results in addition to information about errors and warnings.When the /v parameter isn't used, provides only error and warning information. Use the /v switch when errors or warnings are reported in the summary table.
/x:
Redirects all output to xmllog.xml. This parameter works only with the /test:DNS option.
/xsl: or /xsl:
Adds the processing instructions that reference the specified sheet. This parameter only works with the /test:DNS /x:
