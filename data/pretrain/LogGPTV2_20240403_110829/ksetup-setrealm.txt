ksetup setrealm
Sets the name of a Kerberos realm.
Important
Setting the Kerberos realm on a domain controller isn't supported. Attempting to do so causes a warning and a command failure.
Syntax
ksetup /setrealm 
Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the uppercase DNS name, such as CORP.CONTOSO.COM. You can use the fully-qualified domain name or a simple form of the name. If you don't use uppercase for the DNS name, you'll be asked for verification to continue.
Examples
To set the realm of this computer to a specific domain name, and to restrict access by a non-domain controller just to the CONTOSO Kerberos realm, type:
ksetup /setrealm CONTOSO
