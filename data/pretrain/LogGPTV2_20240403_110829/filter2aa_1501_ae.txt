Functions	
Getting	
  around	
move(Ship	
  ID,	
  Speed,	
  Direction,	
  Destination	
  X,	
  Destination	
  Y)	
Use	
  this	
  function	
  to	
  move	
  ships	
  around	
  the	
  map.	
  Each	
  ship	
  can	
  execute	
  the	
  MOVE	
command	
  once	
  per	
  tic.	
  At	
  the	
  end	
  of	
  a	
  tic,	
  if	
  the	
  ship	
  has	
  not	
  moved,	
  but	
  it	
  has	
  values	
in	
  my_ships.speed	
  and	
  my_ships.direction	
  then	
  the	
  MOVE	
  command	
  will	
  be	
executed	
  automatically	
  for	
  it.	
It	
  is	
  also	
  important	
  to	
  note	
  that	
  moving	
  will	
  decrease	
  the	
  ship's	
  fuel	
  supply	
  when	
accelerating	
  and	
  when	
  decelerating.	
  Whether	
  you	
  travel	
  100m	
  away	
  or	
  1,000,000m	
away,	
  the	
  fuel	
  cost	
  will	
  be	
  2x	
  your	
  speed:	
  once	
  to	
  get	
  up	
  to	
  speed,	
  then	
  once	
  to	
  stop	
at	
  your	
  destination.	
  In	
  addition,	
  fuel	
  is	
  deducted	
  when	
  changing	
  headings	
  mid-­‐flight	
at	
  a	
  cost	
  of	
  1	
  fuel	
  unit	
  per	
  degree	
  changed	
  mid-­‐flight.	
Any	
  errors	
  that	
  occur	
  during	
  this

  will	
  be

error_channel.

  my_ships.speed

  once	
the

refuel_ship(Ship

Using	
  this	
  function	
  will	
  take	
  fuel	
  from	
  your

  add	
  it

  It

When

mine(Mining	
  Ship	
  ID,	
  Planet	
  ID)	
Use	
  this	
  function	
  to	
  mine	
  planets	
  that	
  are	
  in	
  range.	
  Mining	
  is	
  important,	
  because	
  it	
allows	
  you	
  to	
  acquire	
  fuel	
  that	
  can	
  power	
  your	
  fleets	
  or	
  be	
  converted	
  to	
  cash,	
  in	
order	
  to	
  purchase	
  upgrades.	
When	
  a	
  ship	
  starts	
  mining	
  by	
  calling	
  this	
  command,	
  the	
  ship	
  is	
  added	
  to	
  one	
  of	
  the	
hidden	
  Schemaverse	
  system	
  tables.	
  At	
  the	
  end	
  of	
  each	
  system	
  tic,	
  the	
  Schemaverse	
tic.pl	
  script	
  executes	
  a	
  function	
  called	
  mine_planets().	
  For	
  each	
  planet	
  currently	
being	
  mined	
  this	
  tic,	
  the	
  system	
  takes	
  a	
  look	
  at	
  each	
  ships	
  prospecting	
  abilities	
  and	
the	
  amount	
  of	
  mining	
  that	
  can	
  occur	
  on	
  a	
  planet	
  and	
  calculates	
  which	
  ship(s)	
  have	
successfully	
  mined	
  the	
  planet.	
  Once	
  the	
  actual	
  mining	
  takes	
  place,	
  the	
  information	
will	
  be	
  added	
  to	
  the	
  my_events	
  view	
  for	
  all	
  involved	
  players.	
At	
  some	
  point	
  I	
  will	
  write	
  a	
  separate	
  wiki	
  page	
  to	
  describe	
  the	
  mining	
  process	
  in	
  a	
bit	
  more	
  detail.	
Any	
  errors	
  that	
  occur	
  during	
  mining	
  will	
  be	
  piped	
  through	
  the	
  player’s	
error_channel.	
Using	
  this	
  function	
  will	
  act	
  as	
  an	
  Action	
  for	
  the	
  ship.	
  The	
  ship	
  will	
  not	
  be	
  able	
  to	
perform	
  another	
  action	
  until	
  the	
  game
