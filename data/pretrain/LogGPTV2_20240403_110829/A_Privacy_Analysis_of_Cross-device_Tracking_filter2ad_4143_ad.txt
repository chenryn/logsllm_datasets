or not. This result suggests that for some tasks the availability
of cross-device data does not lead to better predictions.
Impact of Device Usage Patterns. What could be the rea-

prediction tasks? Subject to the results of further experiments

it seems that having both mobile and desktop data available
can be an advantage for predictions that rely on features ex-
hibited on one device type only. We did not only observe
such patterns for users with an interest in finance but also
for value shoppers—a randomly selected persona category.
For both interest in finance and the value shopper persona
we evaluated to which extent users respectively accessed the
top 25 finance and value shopping domains on their mobile
and desktop devices. Our results, illustrated in Figure 8,
support the conclusion that having data available from both
mobile and desktop devices increases the chances of captur-
ing (more) salient features for the aforementioned predictions.
For example, an ad network without access to desktop data
would have difficulty to make correct classifications for users
that only access respective domains on their desktop device.
We note that the observed patterns are based on a small
number of users. Thus, further investigation is warranted.
Absence of Device Usage During our study we realized the
possibility of making predictions about users who do not
make use of their devices. Predicting a user’s Jewish religion
serves as an illustrative example.12 Obviously, religious web
domains and apps can be meaningful features for predicting
adherence to a particular faith. However, such predictions are
also possible based on subtler user behaviors. Most notably,
as the data collection of our study covered the last two days of
the Jewish Passover holiday we noticed that a few users in our
study did not use either of their devices as the Jewish faith pre-
scribes abstinence from using electronics. Among all users in
our study the pattern of holiday observation became obvious.
This signal was especially clear from the insight into multiple
devices. While some users did not use one of their devices,
only those observant of Passover did not use both. This ex-
ample illustrates that device activity as such can be a useful
predictor that might be exploitable by cross-device tracking.
7 The Scope of Cross-device Tracking
The scope of cross-device tracking on the Internet is yet
to be explored. For example, through their integration into
many websites and apps Facebook and Google appear to
have vast reach into the various devices of their users as
well as the ability to deterministically match those [73].
12As we obtained this result by chance we confirmed that its publication
is covered by applicable IRB regulations of Columbia University.
However, the percentage to which a typical Internet user
is tracked across devices by those and other cross-device
companies is not known. We examine this question for the
users in our dataset based on a procedure for detecting the
presence of cross-device trackers in their browsing and app
histories (§ 7.1) and analyzing their occurrence accounting
for industry collaborations and consolidation (§ 7.2).
7.1 Detecting Cross-device Trackers
Procedure. We examined the trackers on the websites that
the users in our study visited by automating a Firefox browser
with Selenium [74]. The browser included Lightbeam [63]
and User Agent Switcher [64] browser extensions that al-
lowed us to record the trackers on each domain for both mo-
bile and desktop websites. Third party trackers that we found
in a subdomain were added to the domain, however, not vice
versa. Thus, for example, the domain linkedin.com contains
all trackers that we found on blog.linkedin.com but not the
other way around. To identify trackers inside of apps we
selected a total of 153 third party software development kits
(SDKs) listed on AppBrain [6] encompassing SDKs of ad
networks (e.g., Smaato), social networks (e.g., Twitter), and
analytics services (e.g., comScore). Leveraging AppBrain’s
statistics on the inclusion of SDKs in apps we then deter-
mined which SDKs are included in the apps of our dataset.
We qualify a company as cross-device company based on
our detection of their trackers on both mobile and desktop
domains, the former including apps, and their websites’
claims that they indeed perform cross-device tracking. We
identified cross-device trackers by using Whois domain
searches and tracker blocking lists, especially, the list of the
Better tracker blocker [42]. For some companies—Google
AdSense, Rubicon Project, Skimlinks, Tapad, and Lotame—
our information flow experiment (§ 3) provides empirical
support for qualifying them as cross-device companies. It
would be interesting to extend this or a similar information
flow experiment towards other companies.
Lower Bound. Our approach for detecting trackers should
be understood as a lower bound for various reasons.
First, trackers not identified in Lightbeam will remain
undetected. The same is true for SDKs not included in the
pre-defined set of 153 SDKs from AppBrain. Further, we
only detect app tracking via SDKs and do not account for
Android WebViews and app-internal browsers that could
contain tracking cookies or other traditional online tracking
mechanisms [18]. We believe that these technologies warrant
substantial further investigation as we suspect that a large
amount of trackers make use of them.
Limitations. It is a limitation of our crawl that some
websites in our dataset were not accessible (e.g., sites that
required a user login). In some cases our crawl was also
redirected or the requested page was not found. However,
these limitations only affected few URLs. Also, it should

long tail of smaller companies, some of which are focusing on the mobile space (e.g., Smaato with 2% mobile and 0.2% desktop coverage).

be noted that we crawled the sites about a month after we
finished collecting data from the study participants. Thus, in
the meantime, some websites might have different trackers
than at the time they were actually visited. Ideally, it would
have been possible to capture the trackers live from our users’
devices during the study. However, such collection is difficult
due to the constraints of the Android environment, most
notably, the sandboxing of mobile browsers. In addition,
our mobile tracker count may be off as we did not use real
mobile devices but instead a spoofed desktop browser.
7.2 Cross-Device Tracking Analysis
As shown in Figure 10, websites accessed from desktop
and mobile devices contained a respective total of 9,732 and
3,243 unique third party trackers. 2,571 trackers were on both
desktop and mobile websites; Brookman et al. [11] found
861 such trackers. Out of the 153 SDKs from AppBrain
we found 81 in our dataset.13 From these sets of third party
trackers we identified 124 cross-device trackers; 118 trackers
that appeared on both mobile and desktop websites and 6
SDKs that are associated with a desktop tracker as well. We
found that the 124 cross-device trackers belong to 87 different
companies. It appears that 22 follow a deterministic approach,
39 use probabilistic techniques, and 26 leverage both.
Tracking of the Average User in our Dataset. On average
each user is tracked across devices on his or her desktop
in 67% of all desktop website visits. We measured a
similar average for mobile web visits with 64%. These

Table 5: Cross-device companies’ (D = deterministic and P =
probabilistic according to their websites’ claims) coverage of
websites and apps on average for the users in our dataset (n = 107).
Some of the companies either do not seem to offer an SDK for app
integration (N/A) or we did not analyze it as it was not contained
in our initial set of SDKs from AppBrain (N/A*). The full list,
including the tracking server domains, is attached in Appendix B.
high percentages illustrate that cross-device tracking is a
broadly occurring phenomenon. Table 5 shows the reach
of individual companies. Google Analytics, Google Display,
and Facebook can capture at least 20% of an average user’s
online traffic across devices. This percentage is about
the same that Roesner et al. [72] provided a few years
ago for tracking of individual devices.
It is particularly
noteworthy that the companies with the broadest reach have a
deterministic approach, which means that their cross-device
tracking is also very accurate. Figure 9 shows the tracking
coverage for the 87 cross-device companies we identified.
Partnerships between various cross-device companies ex-
tend their reach. For example, Atlas receives user data from
Facebook [8] to track users deterministically. However, Atlas

Table 6: Domains with the highest cross-device company counts out

is intended to serve advertisements outside of Facebook’s
reach and shares the data it collects with Facebook as well [8].
Particularly, as shown in Table 5, Atlas’ cross-device trackers
extend Facebook’s mobile web reach from 27.7% to 29.1%.
As another example, the partnership between Lotame and
Skimlinks [57], which we actually observed in our initial
experiment (§ 3), also extends their respective reach. In
those cases the relationship between companies needs to be
accounted for to accurately determine their full coverage.
Domains with Cross-device Company Concentration.
It appears that media websites, in particular, websites of
newspapers, contain the largest concentration of trackers
from cross-device companies. Table 6 shows the top ten
domains—separated for desktop and mobile websites—on
which we found the highest number of trackers from the
87 identified cross-device companies. Coincidentally, it
turns out that the website of the LA Times was a good
selection for our case study (§ 3) as it had trackers from 35
cross-device companies on its desktop website.
Beyond the concentration of cross-device companies’
trackers in the media category it is also striking that many
websites that are hosting those trackers are fairly popular
sites. Table 6 shows the Quantcast country rank according
to the site’s traffic [70]. This placement of cross-device
trackers on popular sites exposes them to large audiences.
However, as it can be observed in Table 6 as well, the shown
domains contain a maximum number of trackers from
cross-device companies on either their mobile or desktop
sites but not on both. This finding holds in general. While
there is a tendency that domains that host many cross-device
companies on their desktop site also host many on their
mobile site, we could not find any statistically significant
correlation in this regard. Figure 11 shows the distribution.
8 Does Self-Regulation Work?
The FTC recommends that cross-device companies should
be transparent about their data practices [32]. While there are
no specific statutes or regulations for cross-device tracking in
the U.S., the field is subject to self-regulation, most notably
by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the Network
Advertising Initiative. The DAA requires its member
cross-device companies to disclose “the fact that data
collected from a particular browser or device may be used
with another computer or device that is linked to the browser
