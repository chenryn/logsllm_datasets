User: What is the correct process for having logrotate manage files written to by the python logging module? Usually I would use a WatchedFileHandler but I need to target 2.4, which does not have this class. Is there a function in the logging module which i can attach to a HUP handler, perhaps, to have it reopen the logfile?
Assistant: The logrotate utility needs to be told which files to rotate, and with what options.  You might want to override the standard WatchedFileHandler class to make entries required in /etc/logrotate.d as part of your module load sequence before logging begins.
