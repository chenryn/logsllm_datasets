User: I installed python 3.2 and later installed python 2.7. Somehow the IDLE, which I open it by right-click on python file -> Edit with IDLE, are using python 2.7 instead of python 3.2.
It seems that python 2.7 was set as default with IDLE. Even if I changed the PATH environment variable in windows advance setting back to python 3.2, the default python shell is still 2.7. I am sure that there was no more python 2.7 in the path.
Later I have to uninstall python 2.7 and reinstall python 3.2.
Assistant: The IDLE context menu plug-in is registered when you install Python and points to the version of IDLE supplied with the Python installed. (IDLE itself has significant code changes between Python 2 and 3 because it's written in Python and the language changed a lot.) To change it, simply re-install the version of Python you wish the IDLE context menu to invoke.
