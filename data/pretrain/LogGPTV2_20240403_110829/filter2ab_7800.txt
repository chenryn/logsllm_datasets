### Title: Black Hat USA 2022 Keynote: Black Hat at 25: Where Do We Go from Here?

For the past 25 years, the information security (InfoSec) community and industry have convened in the desert to address the vulnerabilities in the technologies we use daily. Over this period, we have made significant progress through new vulnerability research and insights into adversary tactics. Simultaneously, vendors and software firms have introduced a plethora of new products and protective measures.

As we reflect on the last 25 years and look ahead to the next quarter-century, it is imperative to ask: Are we on the right path? The current trajectory is concerning, given society's relentless and almost pathological drive to connect everything. This constant expansion of the attack surface, coupled with business decisions that often prioritize convenience over security, leaves us vulnerable. Additionally, external factors such as global market realities and shifting geopolitical dynamics can disrupt even the most carefully laid plans and national strategies. The recent years of geopolitical turmoil and autocratic resurgence may seem like a period of relative stability by the end of the 2020s.

This keynote will delve into the current risk trends and their implications for future network defenders. It will also propose necessary shifts in mindset and action to achieve better outcomes, acknowledging that we will always operate in a contested information environment. To borrow a Mitch Hedberg joke (RIP), perhaps over the next 25 years, we can build a safer, more resilient technological future where systems and infrastructure, when they fail, still functionâ€”much like an escalator that turns into stairs.
