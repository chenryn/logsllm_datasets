it hosts significantly fewer hotspots. Verizon comes in a close third.
Most hotspots are on Verizon’s wireline network, but surprisingly
30 of the 1,590 hotspots are backhauled through Verizon wireless.
We also discovered that there are hotspots that use a cloud provider,
such as Digital Ocean (72 hotspots) and Amazon (44 hotspots) rather
than a last-mile provider. We believe these hotspots are validators,
as they appear as hotspots on the blockchain.
Another statistic we looked at was the percentage of unique
ASNs within a city. The number of locally unique ASNs is important
as relying on one ISP could cause a regional outage if that ISP goes
out. In total, there are 3,958 cities with at least one hotspot. Out
of those cities, there is a total of 1,588 cities that relied on only
one ASN, with 414 of those cities having at least 2 hotspots. These
included cities such as Palma, Spain (with a total of 76 hotspots),
Mesa, Arizona (13 hotspots), and Rome, Italy (12 hotspots). An
example of an outage that may have had a large impact on Helium
was the 2020 Spectrum outage in Los Angeles [1]. For a few hours,
Spectrum customers across the city lost Internet access. This could
have taken down 291 out of the 333 hotspots (87%) in Los Angeles.

6.2 Relay Analysis
One side-effect of adoption by individuals and smaller operators is
that many hotspots are on network connections, such as residen-
tial home networks, that do not provide public IPs to all devices.
Depending on NAT (or firewall) configuration, hotspots may not
be able to accept inbound connections. libp2p, which Helium uses
to form its network, addresses this with “Circuit Relays” [13].
When a hotspot cannot directly communicate, it opens a persis-
tent connection with another hotspot on a less restrictive network
to relay messages and data. Peerbook entries are formatted in two
ways: /p2p/relay_node_hash/p2p-circuit/p2p/peer_node_hash for
hotspots who rely on a relay node and /ip4/ipv4_address/tcp/port
for hotspots that have public IPs and accessible ports. Using this
information, we are able to study relay prevalence and behavior.
First, we are surprised by the prevalence of relays. Of the 27,281
hotpots with non-empty listening addresses, 55.48%—more than
half the network!—are relayed. This heavy reliance on relay nodes
increases the meta-infrastructure risks identified in the previous
section, as relayed nodes are beholden to their relaying device.
Next, Figure 10 looks at how relays are distributed among hotspots.
While the majority of relaying nodes support just one or two peer
nodes, there are a few who relay as many as 46 other nodes. We are
unable to determine why these nodes relay such a large number
of peers. One hypothesis we investigated was whether these are
IMC ’21, November 2–4, 2021, Virtual Event, USA

the hard-coded seed peers11 that ship with the hotspot firmware
image, but the high count relay nodes do not match these IPs.
Our next hypothesis is that hotspots bias towards a geograph-
ically nearby peer. Such a design could be problematic for local
robustness: if many geospatially clustered nodes rely on the same
relay peer, then coverage reliability for that whole area would fall
to the reliability of the relaying node. At the same time, ignoring
location also can create problems for a globally distributed network,
particularly one which requires multiple round trip communica-
tions in under 1 s to support LoRaMAC acknowledgments.
We use the asserted location data of each hotspot to compute
the distance between each peer and its relay node and graph the
distribution as a CDF, shown in Figure 11a. The majority of dis-
tances are below 5,000 km. The minimum distance is 0.46 km and
the maximum is 18,491.10 km. While this suggests peer selection is
random, given the non-uniform geospatial distribution of hotspots,
distance alone is insufficient. We next take the list of all relays
and relayed nodes and run multiple trials which randomize the
assignment of peers to relays, as shown in Figure 11b. With this
analysis, we are confident that the Helium network does in fact
assign peers randomly to relay nodes.
7 GOVERNANCE BY INCENTIVE
Because the Helium network is decentralized, it cannot directly
affect change on the deployed infrastructure. Instead, the network
uses economic incentives to motivate changes in user behavior.
While these are relatively stable, “Helium Improvement Proposals,”
or HIPs, can change the rules of the Helium blockchain.12 In princi-
ple, HIPs create economic incentives for hotspot owners to change
their behavior. This section looks at examples of the efficacy and
inefficacy of government by incentive on the Helium network.
7.1 Case Study 1: Silent Movers
As mentioned in Section 2.3, to test location, any hotspot can send a
challenge every 480 blocks to any other hotspot to request that the
“challengee” hotspot prove its location. We wanted to identify any
potential challengees with supposed witnesses that are physically
impossible. To do so, we matched hotspots’ asserted location to the
location of where they witnessed for another hotspot. While there
were not many unique offenders, there was one common offender
whose asserted location was across the country from its witness
location. We will refer to this hotspot as Joyful Pink Skunk.13
Joyful Pink Skunk’s last assert_location transaction was on
April 11, 2021, when it reasserted its location from the state of
Florida to the state of Pennsylvania. We confirm this transition
to be honest as the next time the network selected Joyful Pink
Skunk as a challengee, it was witnessed by hotspots located in
Pennsylvania. Starting May 2, 2021, hotspots in New York, NY and
Brooklyn, NY became valid witnesses for the Joyful Pink Skunk. At
the time of writing this paper, it still has not reasserted its location,
and it witnesses hotspots in the state of New York.
Joyful Pink Skunk never reasserted its location when it moved to
New York. Normally, hotspots should be incentivized to update their
11/ip4/35.166.211.46/tcp/2154,/ip4/44.236.95.167/tcp/2154 from https://

location to earn PoC rewards. Yet, from the challenge receipts, Joyful
Pink Skunk is receiving HNT regardless of whether its current
position matches its last asserted location.
Moreover, hotspots do not have to provide an accurate location
at all. This is evident through the hotspot Striped Yellow Bird13
whose only assert_location puts it in Spokane, Washington, but
all of its challenge receipts place it in San Francisco, California.
Nevertheless, it is still rewarded HNT for providing coverage in an
area that is about 1,150 km away from its purported location.
Takeaway: If location is not properly considered in the rewarding
process, hotspot owners have little to no incentive to keep their
location accurate. As we see in Section 8, inaccurate locations im-
pede coverage modeling. The $40 USD cost to re-assert location is
designed to promote stable spatio-temporal coverage by deterring
hotspot moves, but it does little if owners can skip reporting moves.
7.2 Case Study 2: Lying Witnesses
FCC regulations limit transmitters to +36 dBm EIRP. Yet some wit-
nesses claim an RSSI as high as 1,041,313,293 dBm (presumably
either from a buggy radio driver or a misguided attempt to earn
more rewards for witnessing “well”). While this value is easily
dismissed, it exemplifies that the current PoC model relies on wit-
nesses reporting their RSSI truthfully, while RSSI is easily forged.
Colluding, modestly geospatially clustered nodes could easily gossip
challengee secrets to increase the number of challenges (plausibly!)
“witnessed,” and in turn the gossip clique all earn more rewards.
The blockchain implementation has checks that attempt to use
RSSI to establish whether a witness is “valid” (and should thus re-
ceive PoC reward payment). Real-world RSSI can exhibit enormous
variation [5, 18], however, which inevitably makes such heuristics
brittle. Ultimately, there are misaligned incentives here. The net-
work wants witnesses to honestly report RSSI to better estimate
coverage, while witnesses want to report whatever RSSIs maximize
their likelihood of being rewarded for witnessing (independent of
whether they are an honest recipient of the challengee’s packet).
Takeaway: RSSI is an unreliable, imprecise, and unstandardized
measure. Tying reward payments to it will only incentivize gaming
the metric. Users with uncharacteristic, but honest RSSIs will be
frustrated by unfairly lost revenue and expert manipulators (with
access to the cheating detection algorithm running on the public
blockchain) will always be able to defeat heuristics.
8 EMPIRICAL TESTING
For our final measurements, we ask the question: (how well) does
Helium actually work? We find that while we can deploy devices
and recover data, there are significant limitations today in the
reliability of Helium. One of the largest challenges for persons
considering the own deployment is the absence of a meaningful
coverage model – will Helium cover my system? We use extant
blockchain incentives to derive implicit coverage models, but find
these are quite imperfect, which may imply that our models are
too simplistic, that current incentives do not sufficiently promote
meaningful coverage, or some mixture of both.

IMC ’21, November 2–4, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
8.1 Basic functionality
For a first test, we consider a best-case scenario. We own an (un-
modified) original-batch Helium hotspot, which is attached to our
campus backhaul network (on a subnet that grants public IPs and
access to arbitrary ports). We provision a ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1
LoRaWAN development board, which we choose as it was the first
development board explicitly supported by Helium, and it remains
at the top of the list of platforms on the Helium Quickstart Guide.14
We load a basic app on the device which sends an incrementing
counter. The app is a free-running send, which attempts to send
another packet immediately after the prior packet response.15 We
run this app for about 24 hours and see a packet reception ratio of
68.61%. We see occasional outages in the network of around 2 hours
where no data reaches the cloud. But in between these outages,
we see almost all the packets transmitted making through. This
experiment was carried out between 18 May, 2021 and 19 May, 2021.
During this same time a new firmware was released [11] which is
possibly why we see the network outages leading to a lower PRR.
To try to remove this firmware confound, we re-run this experi-
ment in September 2021. We also relocate our sensor to a residential
neighborhood with a much greater density of hotspots (location
detail in Appendix, Figure 16). Despite these changes, we still see
unreliable performance, with an overall PRR of 73.2% across three
trials. There are no significant gaps. 83.5% of missed packets are
single-misses (i.e. packets before and after were received), 92.2%
are single- or double-misses, and the longest sequential run is a
single instance of 34 consecutive missed packets.
8.2 Coverage
At the end of the day, the most important question for a wireless
infrastructure provider is the quality and availability of service. The
Helium network is expanding quickly. As of this writing, Helium is
averaging an addition of 1,000 new hotspots per day [14] (a claim
we verified in Figure 5). For our studies of coverage, we consider
the state of the network as of May 23, 2021.
8.2.1 Coverage Models. The blockchain records hotspot locations,
but LoRa is intended as a “long-range” wireless technology. This
means we need to develop a model to go from a list of hotspots
to expected geospatial coverage. For these coverage analyses, we
focus on the United States, as Helium’s initial launch was restricted
to US-only territories. While the network is seeing rapid interna-
tional expansion, the US remains its most established market, which
makes it a better representation of current best-case capabilities.
From helium.com: Helium provides a “Coverage Map” at ex-
plorer.helium.com/coverage. Figure 12a is a screenshot from that
website. Green dots represent online hotspots while red dots rep-
resent offline hotspots. While the map is a good representation of
hotspot locations, this view of coverage can be misleading as the
dots indicating hotspots always render at the same size, and thus
individual hotspots appear to cover more and more area as the map
is zoomed out and the landmass underneath a hotspot-dot grows.
14docs.helium.com/use-the-network/devices/development/quickstart-guides/
15LoRaMAC has two acknowledgment windows, one second and two seconds after
transmit. If every packet were ACK’d on the first try, this app would send one packet
per second; if no packet were ever ACK’d, it would send one packet every two seconds.
Density Incentive: HIP 15 specifies that hotspots within 300
meters of each other cannot act as a witness for one another. This is
to promote wide-area coverage by discouraging hotspots from clus-
tering too closely together. The implication then is that a hotspot
should be able to provide coverage to any device within a 300 m
radius. We graph the Helium coverage of the contiguous US using
this 300 m radius model in Figure 12b. Compared to the Helium cov-
erage map in Figure 12a, the area of coverage for the 300 m radius
approach is barely perceivable. The total percentage of contiguous
US landmass covered by the 300 meter radius model is 0.09295%.
Witnesses: As a reminder, witnesses are hotspots that report
challenge packets transmitted by a challengee to confirm the chal-
lengee’s location. There are two types of witnesses: a valid witness
and an invalid witness. A witness is marked valid unless it is deemed
invalid by satisfying one of the following criteria:
• is too close to the challengee (<300m)
• has too high of an RSSI (several heuristics)
• has too low of an RSSI (several heuristics)
• is pentagonally distorted (rare artifact of H3 distance)
• claims capture on the wrong channel (impossible)
While our 300 m radius coverage map provides a better under-
standing of the actual coverage, we believe it to be too conservative.
To alleviate this fact, we use the valid witnesses of a challengee
to infer an empirical measure of coverage. For each challenge, we
draw a convex hull around the challengee and its valid witnesses
and assume coverage of the interior of this hull. We overlay this
coverage model on top of a contiguous US map in Figure 12c.
One problem that becomes evident from the convex hull model
is that some of the “valid” witnesses should in reality not be valid
(indeed, debugging this model led to the examples for Section 7.1).
To craft a more realistic estimate of coverage, we can remove ques-
tionable witnesses by using a more realistic max distance. Murata, a
top LoRa radio vendor, suggests that the realistic range is, “...more
than 10 km, between 15 to 20 km” [15].16 We look at the distribution
of distances for all purportedly valid witnesses in Figure 13. For our
revised convex hull model, we choose a generous 25 km cutoff, after
which we reject “valid” witnesses and exclude them from the hulls.
Figure 12d shows this revised model, with coverage now covering
about 0.5723% of the total contiguous US landmass.
Witness RSSI: While more generous, the basic convex hull
model is still too conservative. In particular, it does not factor in
coverage by the hotspots that make up the exterior vertices of the
convex hulls. We revise the model one final time by including a
radial vertex hotspot coverage model and an RSSI coverage model.
The radial coverage by the vertices is simple: we find the distance
from the vertex witness to the challengee and use the result as the
radial coverage for that witness. As for the RSSI model, we take
the vertex witness RSSI and “grow” the witness–challengee radius
using the standard free space path loss model, 𝑑 = 10 𝑤−𝑠
20 where 𝑑
is the distance to lengthen the radius, 𝑤 is the witness’s RSSI value,
and 𝑠 is the sensitivity of the device hoping for coverage. We set 𝑠
to be a constant -134 dBm as that is the receiver sensitivity of the
recommended ST LoRa hardware platform.
16Geography influences this greatly. As example, there appears to be honest hotspots
(likely with advanced antennas mounted at high-altitude) in Chicago and western
Michigan that witness successfully at ranges of 60-110 km across Lake Michigan.
