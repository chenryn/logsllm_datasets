### Hotspot Distribution and Network Reliability

Verizon hosts significantly fewer hotspots, coming in a close third. Most of the hotspots are on Verizonâ€™s wireline network, but surprisingly, 30 out of the 1,590 hotspots are backhauled through Verizon's wireless network. Additionally, we found that some hotspots use cloud providers such as Digital Ocean (72 hotspots) and Amazon (44 hotspots) instead of traditional last-mile providers. We believe these hotspots are validators, as they appear as hotspots on the blockchain.

### Unique ASNs and Network Resilience

We also examined the percentage of unique Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) within cities. The number of locally unique ASNs is crucial, as relying on a single Internet Service Provider (ISP) can lead to regional outages if that ISP experiences downtime. In total, there are 3,958 cities with at least one hotspot. Out of these, 1,588 cities rely on only one ASN, with 414 of those cities having at least two hotspots. Examples include Palma, Spain (76 hotspots), Mesa, Arizona (13 hotspots), and Rome, Italy (12 hotspots). A notable example of a potential outage impact was the 2020 Spectrum outage in Los Angeles, which could have taken down 291 out of 333 hotspots (87%) in the city.

### Relay Analysis

One side effect of adoption by individuals and smaller operators is that many hotspots are on network connections, such as residential home networks, that do not provide public IPs to all devices. Depending on NAT or firewall configurations, hotspots may not be able to accept inbound connections. Helium addresses this issue using "Circuit Relays" in libp2p. When a hotspot cannot directly communicate, it opens a persistent connection with another hotspot on a less restrictive network to relay messages and data. Peerbook entries are formatted in two ways: 
- `/p2p/relay_node_hash/p2p-circuit/p2p/peer_node_hash` for hotspots that rely on a relay node.
- `/ip4/ipv4_address/tcp/port` for hotspots with public IPs and accessible ports.

Using this information, we studied the prevalence and behavior of relays. We were surprised to find that 55.48% of the 27,281 hotspots with non-empty listening addresses are relayed. This heavy reliance on relay nodes increases the meta-infrastructure risks, as relayed nodes depend on their relaying device. Figure 10 shows the distribution of relays among hotspots. While most relaying nodes support just one or two peer nodes, a few relay as many as 46 other nodes. We hypothesized that these might be the hard-coded seed peers that ship with the hotspot firmware image, but the high count relay nodes did not match these IPs.

Our next hypothesis was that hotspots might prefer geographically nearby peers. Such a design could be problematic for local robustness, as many geospatially clustered nodes relying on the same relay peer would make coverage reliability dependent on the relaying node. Ignoring location can also create problems for a globally distributed network, especially one that requires multiple round-trip communications under 1 second to support LoRaMAC acknowledgments.

We used the asserted location data of each hotspot to compute the distance between each peer and its relay node, graphing the distribution as a CDF in Figure 11a. The majority of distances are below 5,000 km, with a minimum of 0.46 km and a maximum of 18,491.10 km. This suggests that peer selection is random, given the non-uniform geospatial distribution of hotspots. We then ran multiple trials randomizing the assignment of peers to relays, as shown in Figure 11b, confirming that the Helium network does assign peers randomly to relay nodes.

### Governance by Incentive

The Helium network, being decentralized, uses economic incentives to motivate changes in user behavior. These incentives are relatively stable, but "Helium Improvement Proposals" (HIPs) can change the rules of the Helium blockchain. HIPs aim to create economic incentives for hotspot owners to change their behavior. This section examines the efficacy and inefficacy of governance by incentive on the Helium network.

#### Case Study 1: Silent Movers

To test location, any hotspot can send a challenge every 480 blocks to another hotspot, requesting the "challengee" to prove its location. We identified potential challengees with physically impossible witnesses. One common offender, referred to as Joyful Pink Skunk, had an asserted location across the country from its witness location. Joyful Pink Skunk's last assert_location transaction was on April 11, 2021, when it reasserted its location from Florida to Pennsylvania. This transition was confirmed as honest, as the next time it was selected as a challengee, it was witnessed by hotspots in Pennsylvania. Starting May 2, 2021, hotspots in New York, NY, and Brooklyn, NY, became valid witnesses for Joyful Pink Skunk. However, it has not reasserted its location since moving to New York and continues to witness hotspots in New York.

Joyful Pink Skunk never reasserted its location when it moved to New York. Normally, hotspots should be incentivized to update their location to earn Proof of Coverage (PoC) rewards. Yet, from the challenge receipts, Joyful Pink Skunk is receiving HNT regardless of whether its current position matches its last asserted location. Another example is Striped Yellow Bird, whose only assert_location places it in Spokane, Washington, but all challenge receipts place it in San Francisco, California. Despite this, it still receives HNT for providing coverage in an area about 1,150 km away from its purported location.

**Takeaway:** If location is not properly considered in the rewarding process, hotspot owners have little to no incentive to keep their location accurate. Inaccurate locations impede coverage modeling, and the $40 USD cost to re-assert location does little if owners can skip reporting moves.

#### Case Study 2: Lying Witnesses

FCC regulations limit transmitters to +36 dBm EIRP, but some witnesses claim RSSI values as high as 1,041,313,293 dBm, likely due to a buggy radio driver or an attempt to earn more rewards. While this value is easily dismissed, it highlights that the current PoC model relies on truthful RSSI reporting, which is easily forged. Colluding, geospatially clustered nodes could gossip challengee secrets to increase the number of challenges "witnessed," earning more rewards.

The blockchain implementation has checks to use RSSI to establish whether a witness is valid, but real-world RSSI can exhibit enormous variation, making such heuristics brittle. There are misaligned incentives: the network wants honest RSSI reports to better estimate coverage, while witnesses want to report RSSIs that maximize their rewards.

**Takeaway:** RSSI is an unreliable, imprecise, and unstandardized measure. Tying reward payments to it will only incentivize gaming the metric. Users with uncharacteristic but honest RSSIs will be frustrated by unfairly lost revenue, and expert manipulators will always be able to defeat heuristics.

### Empirical Testing

For our final measurements, we asked: how well does Helium actually work? While we can deploy devices and recover data, there are significant limitations in the reliability of Helium. One of the largest challenges is the absence of a meaningful coverage model. We used existing blockchain incentives to derive implicit coverage models, but found these to be quite imperfect.

#### Basic Functionality

In a best-case scenario, we tested an unmodified original-batch Helium hotspot attached to our campus backhaul network. We provisioned a ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRaWAN development board, loaded a basic app that sends an incrementing counter, and ran the app for about 24 hours. The packet reception ratio (PRR) was 68.61%, with occasional outages of around 2 hours. We re-ran the experiment in September 2021, relocating the sensor to a residential neighborhood with a higher density of hotspots. Despite these changes, the overall PRR was 73.2% across three trials, with 83.5% of missed packets being single-misses and 92.2% being single- or double-misses.

#### Coverage

The most important question for a wireless infrastructure provider is the quality and availability of service. As of May 23, 2021, Helium was adding 1,000 new hotspots per day. For our coverage studies, we focused on the United States, as it remains Helium's most established market.

##### Coverage Models

Helium provides a "Coverage Map" on explorer.helium.com/coverage, but this view can be misleading as it does not account for the actual coverage area. HIP 15 specifies that hotspots within 300 meters of each other cannot act as witnesses for one another, implying a 300-meter radius coverage. Using this model, the total percentage of contiguous US landmass covered is 0.09295%.

We used valid witnesses of a challengee to infer an empirical measure of coverage, drawing a convex hull around the challengee and its valid witnesses. This model, however, includes some invalid witnesses. To address this, we used a more realistic max distance of 25 km, resulting in coverage of about 0.5723% of the total contiguous US landmass.

##### Witness RSSI

While more generous, the basic convex hull model is still too conservative. We revised the model by including a radial vertex hotspot coverage model and an RSSI coverage model. The radial coverage by the vertices is simple: we find the distance from the vertex witness to the challengee and use the result as the radial coverage. For the RSSI model, we use the standard free space path loss model, \( d = 10 \frac{w-s}{20} \), where \( d \) is the distance, \( w \) is the witness's RSSI value, and \( s \) is the sensitivity of the device, set to -134 dBm.

**Takeaway:** The Helium network shows promise but faces significant challenges in reliability and coverage. Accurate location reporting and reliable RSSI values are critical for improving the network's performance.
