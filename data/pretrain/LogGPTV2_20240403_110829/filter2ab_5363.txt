### Title: Black Hat USA 2020: Compromising the macOS Kernel through Safari by Chaining Six Vulnerabilities

Compromising a kernel via a web browser is the ultimate goal for many offensive security researchers. Despite continuous efforts to eliminate vulnerabilities and introduce various mitigations, achieving a remote kernel exploit from a browser has become extremely challenging, often seeming nearly impossible.

In this presentation, we will share our Safari exploit, which was submitted to Pwn2Own 2020. By chaining six distinct vulnerabilities, our exploit successfully compromises the macOS kernel, starting from the Safari browser. This exploit overcomes all major mitigations in macOS, including Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), sandboxing, and even System Integrity Protection (SIP).

We will delve into each of the vulnerabilities used in this exploit, showcasing not only cutting-edge hacking techniques but also highlighting the challenges in securing complex systems such as browsers and operating systems. Additionally, we will introduce a new technique that reliably exploits a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in macOS.
