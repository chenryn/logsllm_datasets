(cid:128)rst group corresponds to the encodings from this paper
(Section 5). (cid:88) means the tool fully proved the scheme, ×
means it could not prove the scheme. For every scheme we
provide the level of symbolic security that was analyzed. For
the schemes marked with ∗, one-key symbolic security is
enough to achieve many-key security in the GGM (see (cid:135)e-
orem 4.1).
several encodings from the literature, like CP-ABE’s and KP-ABE’s
from [36], or the CP-ABE for negated boolean formulas from [11].
For the most complex examples, like our CP-ABE and KP-ABE, our
tool is only able to prove security for (cid:128)xed-size dimensions. In some
cases this is because it is hard to express the security of the full
scheme with our grammar, while in others, our heuristics do not
succeed in (cid:128)nding a proof. (cid:145)e tool is also able to (cid:128)nd the a(cid:139)ack
against the candidate Unbounded KP-ABE(cid:52) automatically.
Comparison with previous work. We note that our tool follows the
approach of the Generic Group Analyzer, gga [20] and the Generic
Group Analyzer Unbounded, gga∞ [10], and as the later our tool can
express systems of equations depending on an unbounded number
of terms, which allows to handle many security experiments of
interest. Additionally, our tool is de(cid:128)ned over a new grammar
(described in Figure 6) and therefore, it complements previous
tools and broadens the class of schemes than can be analyzed with
computer-assistance. In particular, our handling of division / and
big products su(cid:129)ces to handle many of the primitives proposed
in this work.
7 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
We have implemented the schemes introduced in the previous sec-
tion, as well as several Identity-Based Encryption from the literature.
Our implementation uses Charm [7] for pairings with a prime-order

proving automatically security of several schemes, including some
variants of previous schemes or new schemes, and for discovering
subtle a(cid:139)acks.
(cid:145)ere are many directions for further work. On the theoretical
side, it would be interesting to prove that RFI ABE are selectively
secure in the standard model, under a strong Q-type assumption.
On the practical side, it would be very interesting to develop syn-
thesis techniques for exploring the space of RFI ABE. As in prior
works using synthesis [10, 22], we plan to explore large classes
of constructions systematically, using our tool for (cid:128)nding a(cid:139)acks
and proofs. In order to achieve broader coverage (in other words
minimize the number of schemes for which the tool times out),
we intend to improve the e(cid:129)ciency of the tool both for (cid:128)nding
a(cid:139)acks and proofs. Moreover, it would be desirable to establish
mathematical theorems that justify focusing on more restricted,
tractable, classes of constructions—else the search space far exceeds
current computing capabilities. Beyond ABE, it seems appealing to
explore whether our tool could be used for Structure-Preserving
Signatures and in particular to synthesize Structure-Preserving
Signatures based on rational fractions.

224-bits Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano Curve [52]. (cid:145)e exper-
iments were executed on a 2.40GHz Intel Core i7-3630QM CPU
with 8GB of RAM. We use our implementations to compare the
performance between the di(cid:130)erent schemes (see Figure 7). Expect-
edly, IBE1 outperforms other constructions, highlighting the usual
trade-o(cid:130) between e(cid:129)ciency and security in the standard model.
We provide more details below.
For every construction, we evaluate the performance of setup,
encryption, key generation and decryption on 100 executions, dis-
playing the average time (in milliseconds). Encryption and key
generation take an identity as input, which is chosen uniformly at
random (in Zp) in every execution (this is not considered part of
the execution time). We also include the IBE of Boneh and Franklin
[29], arguably on of the most e(cid:129)cient IBE (which is proven secure
in the Random Oracle Model). Note that the encryption in IBE 1 is
more e(cid:129)cient that in [29], since contrary to the la(cid:139)er, IBE 1 does
not require to hash into the source group G1, and it does not require
to compute a pairing. To make the comparison more fair, in our
implementation of [29], we consider a naive and e(cid:129)cient hashing
from Zp into G1 (performed once in encryption and once in key
generation). Note, however, that for security, this hashing cannot
be done naively (see [33] for instance).
8 CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have presented an automated method for analyzing security of
ABE in the Generic Group Model. Our work signi(cid:128)cantly broadens
the scope of automated analyses in the Generic Group Model, and
nicely complements prior works on proving security of ABE in
