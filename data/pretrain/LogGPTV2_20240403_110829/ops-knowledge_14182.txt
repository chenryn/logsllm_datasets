Assistant: Existence of exception: Existence of exception Exception type: System exception Exception reason/solution: The error log is an application log, which shows that the system found an error that a directory does not exist during the LOGIN operation. Therefore, it can be judged that the exception type is a system exception. This error is usually caused by a file or directory required by the program that does not exist or is not readable. It is necessary to troubleshoot the error, confirm whether the directory that the application needs to access exists and whether it can be read, and check the file read permission setting. If the directory does not exist or is unreadable, you need to create or repair the relevant directory, and ensure that the application has read permission for the directory. After confirming that directory and file permissions are set correctly, the application needs to be restarted to resume normal service.
