User: I have some code written in Python which can not be transferred to a .NET language. I need to call one of these functions from my .NET WinForms application.
Now, I do it by starting the Python script as a separate process and pass parameters to it as command line arguments. It works, but I don't really like this solution. I'd like to improve it to a better one.
Is there any better way to call a function of a .py script from a .NET application? What is the best way to do it?
Note: IronPython is NOT an option for this Python script

No, AFAIK there isn't a better solution, especially if IronPython is a no-no for you. So you could still keep this as a temporary workaround while waiting for the script to be migrated to .NET or until you find that someone already wrote a library on .NET that provides you with similar functionality.
