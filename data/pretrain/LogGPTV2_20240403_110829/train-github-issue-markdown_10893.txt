JSON standard (http://json.org/) say, that any entity can be object or array.  
When I try:
    jsonify(['a','b','c', 'd', 'e', 'f'])
I got an error:
    ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 8; 2 is required
I think it is not a correct answer from flask. It should returns a JSON-object
with array.
