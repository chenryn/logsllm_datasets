**ATT&CK ID:** G0094  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Kimsuky

Kimsuky has been observed using the following command to hide a newly created user by modifying the Windows Registry:

```plaintext
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList" /v <username> /t REG_DWORD /d 0
```

This command adds the specified user to the `UserList` key, effectively hiding the user account from the Windows logon screen. [6]
