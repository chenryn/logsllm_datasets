### Risk Response

**Risk Response Decisions and Actions:**
- **Avoidance:** Eliminate the risk by not engaging in the activity that generates it.
- **Mitigation:** Implement measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
- **Escalation to FASC (Federal Acquisition Security Council):** Coordinate and triage the risk for a higher-level decision.

**Additional Information:**
- Provide any other relevant information as directed by the FASC or as deemed necessary by the agency. This includes factors that could influence the assessment of supply chain risk, such as potential impacts on agency functions and any other pertinent details.

### Review and Clearance

**Credibility and Confidence:**
- Ensure the credibility and confidence in the sources and available information used for the risk assessment are addressed. This includes the use of alternatives and mitigation efforts.
- Confirm that the assessment record has been reviewed and cleared by applicable officials, including senior leadership and legal counsel, especially for risks assessed as substantial.
- The review and clearance process also ensures that the assessment record and supporting information are appropriately safeguarded, marked, and access-controlled.

### Assessment Record

**Record Management:**
- Agencies must adhere to records management requirements for Supply Chain Risk Assessments (SCRAs) and supporting artifacts.
- Policies and procedures should be in place to address the requisite safeguarding, marking, handling, retention, and dissemination requirements and restrictions associated with the assessment record and its content.

**Agreements and Contracts:**
- If assessment services (e.g., analytic support) or commercially-provided information are obtained to support the development of an assessment record, an agreement (e.g., contract, interagency agreement) should specify appropriate requirements and restrictions. These include the scope, purpose of data use, limitations, access, disposal, and retention rights.

**Publication Availability:**
- This publication is available free of charge from: [https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1)

**Appendix F: Response to Executive Order 14028’s Call to Publish Guidelines for Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security**

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Departments and agencies seeking to implement Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 14028, "Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity," should reference NIST’s dedicated EO 14028 web-based portal at: [https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity](https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity)
- This guidance has been moved online to:
  - Co-locate it with related EO guidance under NIST’s purview.
  - Enable updates to reflect evolving guidance without directly impacting SP 800-161, Rev. 1.
  - Provide traceability and linkage with other NIST web-based assets to encourage dynamic and interactive engagement with stakeholders.

### Appendix G: C-SCRM Activities in the Risk Management Process

**Risk Management Process:**
- The risk management process involves four key steps: Frame, Assess, Respond, and Monitor. These steps are iterative and not inherently sequential, allowing flexibility in how they are performed.
- Different individuals may perform these steps simultaneously based on specific needs or situations. The outputs from one step directly impact other steps in the process.

**Figures:**
- **Figure G-1:** Depicts the interrelationships among the risk management process steps, including the order of analysis and the interactions required.
- **Figure G-2:** Summarizes C-SCRM activities throughout the risk management process, showing the flow of information and guidance among the steps.

**Detailed Description:**
- The remainder of this section provides a detailed description of C-SCRM activities within the Frame, Assess, Respond, and Monitor steps of the Risk Management Process. The structure mirrors that of [NIST SP 800-39], Sections 3.1-3.4, and includes Inputs and Preconditions, Activities, and Outputs and Post-Conditions.

**Target Audience:**
- This appendix is intended for individuals with specific C-SCRM responsibilities, including those responsible for defining frameworks and methodologies used by the enterprise, mission, and business process risk managers, and others who may find the guidance useful.

**Enterprise-Wide Risk Management and the RMF:**
- Managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain requires a concerted effort across enterprise, mission, and operational levels.
- Two complementary risk management approaches are described: FARM (Frame, Assess, Respond, Monitor) and the Risk Management Framework (RMF).
- FARM is primarily used at Level 1 and Level 2 to establish the enterprise’s risk context, while the RMF operates at Level 3, the operational level, and consists of seven steps: Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, and Monitor.
- Information flow between the levels is bidirectional, with aggregated Level 3 RMF outputs serving to update and refine assumptions made at Level 1 and Level 2.

**Frame Step:**
- **Inputs and Preconditions:**
  - Establish the context for C-SCRM at all three levels, including the scope and structure of the enterprise supply chain, overall risk management strategy, and specific enterprise and mission and business process strategies and plans.
  - Data and information collected during the Frame step provide inputs for scoping and fine-tuning C-SCRM activities in other steps.
- **Activities:**
  - Define C-SCRM assumptions, constraints, risk appetite/tolerance, and priorities/trade-offs.
  - Develop C-SCRM governance and operating models.
  - Integrate C-SCRM into enterprise risk management.
- **Outputs:**
  - C-SCRM requirements, strategy, policies, and procedures.
  - Integration of C-SCRM into the enterprise's continuous monitoring program.

**Figures:**
- **Figure G-3:** Depicts the inputs, activities, and outputs of the Frame step distributed along the three risk management framework levels, showing the flow of information and guidance.

This document aims to provide a comprehensive and structured approach to managing cybersecurity supply chain risks, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered and that the process is both flexible and robust.
