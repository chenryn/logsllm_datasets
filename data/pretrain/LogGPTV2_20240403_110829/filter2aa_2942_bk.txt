with use of the source or covered article. 
Risk response 
Describe risk response decisions or actions taken (e.g., 
avoid, mitigate, escalate to FASC for coordination and 
triaging). 
Any other information, as 
specified and directed to provide 
by the FASC or is included per 
agency discretion 
Describe or provide information that would factor into an 
assessment of supply chain risk, including any impact to 
agency functions and other information as the FASC 
deems appropriate. 
Review and clearance 
Ensure that the credibility of and confidence in the sources 
and available information used for risk assessment 
associated with proceeding, using alternatives, and/or 
enacting mitigation efforts is addressed. Confirm that the 
assessment record was reviewed and cleared by applicable 
officials, to include applicable Senior Leadership and legal 
counsel, for risk assessed as being substantial. Review and 
clearance are also intended to ensure that the assessment 
record and supporting information are appropriately 
safeguarded, marked, and access-controlled. 
Assessment Record  
Agencies should ensure that records management requirements are adhered to with regard to 
SCRAs and supporting artifacts. Policies and procedures should be in place that address the 
requisite safeguarding, marking, handling, retention, and dissemination requirements and 
restrictions associated with an assessment record and its associated content.  
If and when assessment services (e.g., analytic support) or commercially-provided information 
are obtained to support the development of an assessment record, an agreement (e.g., contract, 
interagency agreement) should specify appropriate requirements and restrictions about scope, the 
purpose of data use, and limitations, access, disposal, and retention rights.

APPENDIX G: C-SCRM ACTIVITIES IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS55 
Risk management is a comprehensive process that requires enterprises to: 1) frame risk (i.e., 
establish the context for risk-based decisions), 2) assess risk, 3) respond to risk once determined, 
and 4) monitor risk on an ongoing basis using effective enterprise communications and a 
feedback loop for continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of enterprises. Figure G-
1 depicts interrelationships among the risk management process steps, including the order in 
which each analysis may be executed and the interactions required to ensure that the analysis is 
inclusive of the various inputs at the enterprise, mission, and operations levels. 
Fig. G-1: Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) 
The steps in the risk management process (Frame, Assess, Respond, and Monitor) are iterative 
and not inherently sequential in nature. Different individuals may be required to perform the 
steps at the same time, depending on a particular need or situation. Enterprises have significant 
flexibility in how the risk management steps are performed (e.g., sequence, degree of rigor, 
formality, and thoroughness of application) and in how the results of each step are captured and 
shared both internally and externally. The outputs from a particular risk management step will 
directly impact one or more of the other risk management steps in the risk management process.  
Figure G-2 summarizes C-SCRM activities throughout the risk management process as they are 
performed within the three risk framework levels. The arrows between different steps of the risk 
management process depict the simultaneous flow of information and guidance among the steps. 
55 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity.

Figure G-2 depicts interrelationships among the risk management process steps, including the 
order in which each analysis is executed and the interactions required to ensure that the analysis 
is inclusive of the various inputs at the enterprise, mission and business process, and operational 
levels.  
The remainder of this section provides a detailed description of C-SCRM activities within the 
Frame, Assess, Respond, and Monitor steps of the Risk Management Process. The structure of 
subsections Frame through Monitor mirrors the structure of [NIST SP 800-39], Sections 3.1-3.4. 
For each step of the Risk Management Process (i.e., Frame, Assess, Respond, Monitor), the 
structure includes Inputs and Preconditions, Activities, and Outputs and Post-Conditions. 
Activities are further organized into Tasks according to [NIST SP 800-39]. [NIST SP 800-161, 
Rev 1.] cites the steps and tasks of the risk management process, but rather than repeating any 
other content of [NIST SP 800-39], it provides C-SCRM-specific guidance for each step with its 
Inputs and Preconditions, Activities with corresponding Tasks, and Outputs and Post-Conditions. 
This document adds one task to those provided in [NIST SP 800-39] under the Assess step: Task 
2-0, Criticality Analysis.

TARGET AUDIENCE 
The target audience for this appendix is those individuals with specific C-SCRM responsibilities 
for performing the supply chain risk management process across and at each level. Examples 
include those process/functional staff responsible for defining the frameworks and 
methodologies used by the rest of the enterprise (e.g., C-SCRM PMO Processes, Enterprise Risk 
Management, Mission and Business Process Risk Managers, etc.). Other personnel or entities are 
free to make use of the guidance as appropriate to their situation.  
ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT AND THE RMF 
Managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain requires a concerted and purposeful 
effort by enterprises across enterprise, mission and business process, and operational levels. This 
document describes two different but complementary risk management approaches that are 
iteratively combined to facilitate effective risk management across the three levels.  
The first approach is known as FARM and consists of four steps: Frame, Assess, Respond, and 
Monitor. FARM is primarily used at Level 1 and Level 2 to establish the enterprise’s risk context 
and inherent exposure to risk. Then, the risk context from Level 1 and Level 2 iteratively informs 
the activities performed as part of the second approach described in [NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2], 
The Risk Management Framework (RMF). The RMF predominantly operates at Level 356 – the 
operational level – and consists of seven process steps: Prepare, Categorize, Select, Implement, 
Assess, Authorize, and Monitor. Within the RMF, inputs from FARM at Level 1 and Level 2 are 
synthesized as part of the RMF Prepare step and then iteratively applied, tailored, and updated 
through each successive step of the RMF. Ultimately, Level 1 and Level 2 assumptions are 
iteratively customized and tailored to fit the specific operational level or procurement action 
context. For example, an enterprise may decide on strategic priorities and threats at Level 1 
(enterprise level), which inform the criticality determination of mission and business processes at 
Level 2, which in turn influence the system categorization, control selection, and control 
implementation as part of the RMF at Level 3 (operational level). Information flow between the 
levels is bidirectional with aggregated Level 3 RMF outputs serving to update and refine 
assumptions made at Level 1 and Level 2 on a periodic basis.  
Frame  
Inputs and Preconditions 
Frame is the step that establishes the context for C-SCRM at all three levels. The scope and 
structure of the enterprise supply chain, the overall risk management strategy, specific enterprise 
and mission and business process strategies and plans, and individual information systems are 
defined in this step. The data and information collected during Frame provides inputs for scoping 
and fine-tuning C-SCRM activities in other risk management process steps throughout the three 
levels. Frame is also where guidance in the form of frameworks and methodologies is established 
as part of the enterprise and mission and business process level risk management strategies. 
56 The RMF does have some applications at Level 1 and Level 2, such as the identification of common controls.

These frameworks and methodologies provide bounds, standardization, and orientation for 
supply chain risk management activities performed within later steps.  
[NIST SP 800-39] defines risk framing as “the set of assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, 
and priorities/trade-offs that shape an enterprise’s approach for managing risk.” Enterprise-wide 
and C-SCRM risk-framing activities should iteratively inform one another. Assumptions that the 
enterprise makes about risk should flow down and inform risk framing within C-SCRM activities 
(e.g., enterprise’s strategic priorities). As the enterprise’s assumptions about cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain evolve through the execution of C-SCRM activities, these 
assumptions should flow up and inform how risk is framed at the enterprise level (e.g., level of 
risk exposure to individual suppliers). Inputs into the C-SCRM risk framing process include but 
are not limited to:  
• Enterprise policies, strategies, and governance 
• Applicable laws and regulations 
• Agency critical suppliers and contractual services 
• Enterprise processes (security, quality, etc.) 
• Enterprise threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and risk tolerance 
• Enterprise architecture 
• Mission-level goals and objectives 
• Criticality of missions/processes 
• Mission-level security policies 
• Functional requirements 
• Criticality of supplied system/product components 
• Security requirements 
C-SCRM risk framing is an iterative process that also uses inputs from the other steps of the risk 
management processes (Assess, Respond, and Monitor) as inputs. Figure D-3 depicts the Frame 
step with its inputs and outputs along the three enterprise levels. At the enterprise level, activities 
will focus on framing conditions (i.e., assumptions, constraints, appetites and tolerances, and 
priorities and trade-offs) that are broadly applicable across the enterprise. The goal of framing is 
to contextualize cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain in relation to the enterprise and 
its strategic goals and objectives. At Level 2, frame activities focus on tailoring the risk frame to 
individual mission and business processes (e.g., assumptions about service provider’s role in 
achieving mission or business objectives).  
Finally, at Level 3, conditions outlined at Level 1 and Level 2 iteratively inform each step of the 
RMF process. Beginning with the Prepare step, conditions outlined at Level 1 and Level 2 are 
used to establish the context and priorities for managing cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain with respect to individual information systems, supplied system components, and 
system service providers. With each subsequent RMF step (Categorize through Monitor), these 
assumptions are iteratively updated and tailored to reflect applicable operational-level 
considerations. Information flow must be bidirectional between levels as insights discovered 
while performing lower-level activities may update what is known about conditions outlined in 
higher levels.

Fig. G-3: C-SCRM in the Frame Step 
Figures G-3 through G-6 depict inputs, activities, and outputs of the Frame step distributed along 
the three risk management framework levels. The large arrows on the left and right sides of the 
activities depict the inputs and outputs to and from other steps of the Risk Management Process. 
Inputs into the Frame step include inputs from other steps and from the enterprise risk 
management process that are shaping the C-SCRM process. Up-down arrows between the levels 
depict the flow of information and guidance from the upper levels to the lower levels and the 
flow of information and feedback from the lower levels to the upper levels. Together, the arrows 
indicate that the inputs, activities, and outputs are continuously interacting and influencing one 
another.
