### Syntax
```shell
change logon {/query | /enable | /disable | /drain | /drainuntilrestart}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/query`           | Displays the current logon status, indicating whether logons are enabled or disabled. |
| `/enable`          | Enables logons from client sessions, but not from the console.               |
| `/disable`         | Disables subsequent logons from client sessions, but not from the console. Does not affect currently logged-on users. |
| `/drain`           | Disables logons from new client sessions, but allows reconnections to existing sessions. |
| `/drainuntilrestart` | Disables logons from new client sessions until the computer is restarted, but allows reconnections to existing sessions. |
| `/?`               | Displays help at the command prompt.                                         |

### Remarks
- Logons are automatically re-enabled when the system is restarted.
- If you are connected to the Remote Desktop Session Host server from a client session and disable logons before logging off, you will not be able to reconnect to your session. To re-enable logons from client sessions, log on at the console.
