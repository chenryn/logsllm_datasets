User: How can I set real time priority with psutil. When I try this: process.nice(psutil.REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS) REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS results in HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS.
Assistant: I had exactly the same problem, running python with "as Administrator" solved the issue (On Win10 with python3.7).
Create a windows shortcut to "python " and set "Run as administrator" in the Advanced settings of the shortcut.
