User: I am building a framework for executing tasks on top of Celery framework.
I would like to see the list of recently executed tasks (for the recent 2-7 days).
Looking on the API I can find app.backend object, but cannot figure out how to make a query to fetch tasks.
For example I can use backends like Redis or database. I do not want to explicitly write SQL queries to database.
Is there a way to work with task history/results with API?
I tried to use Flower, but it can only handle events and cannot get history before its start.
Assistant: You can use the persisent optionï¼Œeg: flower -A ctq.celery --persistent=True
