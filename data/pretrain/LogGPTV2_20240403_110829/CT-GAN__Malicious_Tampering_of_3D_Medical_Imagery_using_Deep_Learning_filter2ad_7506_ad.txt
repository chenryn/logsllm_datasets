planes, (2) shifted the cuboid by 4 pixels in each direction on
the xy plane, and (3) rotated the cuboid 360 degrees at 6 degree
intervals. This produced an additional 66 instances for each
sample. The ﬁnal training set had 11,323 training samples.
To create the training set for GANrem, we ﬁrst selected clean
CT scans which had no nodules detected by the radiologists. On
these scans, we used the nodule detection algorithm from [55]
(also provided in the dataset’s annotations) to ﬁnd benign
micro nodules. Of the detected micro nodules, we selected 867
nodules at random and performed the same data augmentation
as above. The ﬁnal training set had 58,089 samples.
Prior to training the GANs, all of the samples were
preprocessed with scaling, equalization, and normalization
(described in the next section in detail). Both of the GANs
were trained on their respective datasets for 200 epochs with a
batch size of 50 samples. Each GAN took 26 hours to complete
its training on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X using all
of the GPU’s memory. Fig. 7 shows how well GANinj was able
to in-paint cancer patterns after 150 epochs.
5.3 Execution: The Tampering Process
In order to inject/remove lung cancer, pre/post-processing
steps are required. The following describes the entire

trained to perform in-painting on samples which are 323
voxels in dimension. For the completion mask, we zero-out
a 163 cube in the center of the input sample. To inject a large
pulmonary nodule into a CT scan, we train GANinj on cancer
samples which have a diameter of least 10mm. As a result,
the trained generator completes sample cuboids with similar
sized nodules. To remove cancer, GANrem is trained using the
same architecture, but with samples containing benign lung
nodules only (having a diameter  3mm are
found. If the attacker is injecting cancer, then (optionally)
return to step 2 until four injections have been performed.
The reason for this is because the risk of a patient being
diagnosed with cancer is statistically greater in the presence
of exactly four solitary pulmonary nodules having a
diameter >8mm [53].
14. Return Data. The scan is converted back into the original
format (e.g. DICOM) and returned back to the source.
The quality of the injection/removal process can be viewed
in ﬁgures 9 and 10. Fig. 9 presents a variety of examples before
and after tampering, and Fig. 10 provides a 3D visualization
of a cancer being injected and removed. More visual samples
can be found in the appendix (ﬁgures 19 and 20).
We note that although some steps involve image touch-ups,
the entire process is automatic (unlike Photoshop) and thus can
be deployed in an autonomous malware or inside a viewing
application (real-time tampering). We note that the same
neural architecture and tampering process works on other
modalities and medical conditions. For example, Fig. 18 in the
appendix shows CT-GAN successfully injecting brain tumors
into MRI head scans.
6 Evaluation
In this section we present our evaluation on how well the CT-
GAN attack can fool expert radiologists and state-of-the-art AI.
6.1 Experiment Setup
To evaluate the attack, we recruited three radiologists
(denoted R1, R2, and R3) with 2, 5, and 7 years of experience
respectively. We also used a trained lung cancer screening
model (denoted AI), the same deep learning model which won
the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Bowl (a $1 million competition
for diagnosing lung cancer).15
The experiment was performed in two trials: blind and open.
In the blind trial, the radiologists were asked to diagnose 80
complete CT scans of lungs, but they were not told the purpose
of the experiment or that some of the scans were manipulated.

Table 2: Summary of the scans and the relevant notations
In the open trial, the radiologists were told about the attack,
and were asked to identify fake, real, and removed nodules
in 20 CT scans. In addition, the radiologists were asked to
rate the conﬁdence of their decisions. After each trial, we gave
the radiologists a questionnaire to assess how susceptible they
were to the attacks. In all cases, the radiologists were asked
to only detect and diagnose pulmonary nodules which have
a diameter greater than 3mm.
The CT scans were taken from the LIDC-IDRI dataset [54].
The set of CT scans used in each trial and the notations used
in this section are available in Table 2.
False benign (FB) and true malign (TM) scans truthfully
contained at least one nodule with a diameter between 10mm
and 16mm. FB scans were made by removing every nodule
in the scan. FM scans were made by randomly injecting 1-4

nodules into a benign scan, where the injected nodules had
a diameter of 14.4mm on average. In total, there were 100 CT
scans analyzed by each of the radiologists, and the radiologists
spent approximately 10 minutes analyzing each of these scans.
We note that the use of three radiologists is common
practice in medical research (e.g., [56]). Moreover, we found
that radiologists (and AI) signiﬁcantly agreed with each
other’s diagnosis per patient and per nodule. We veriﬁed
this agreement by computing Fliess’ kappa [57] (a statistical
interrater reliability measure) which produced an excellent
kappa of 0.84 (p-value < 0.0001). Therefore, adding more
radiologists will likely not affect the results.
6.2 Results: Blind Trial
In Table 3 we present the cancer detection performance of
the radiologists and AI. The table lists the number of false-
positives (FP - detected a non-existent cancer), true-positives

(TP - detected a real cancer), false-negatives (FN - missed a
real cancer), and their respective rates. The TCIA annotations
(nodule locations) were used as our ground truth for measuring
the performance on FB and TM scans. We evaluated these met-
rics per instance of cancer, and per patient as a whole. All four
detectors performed well on the baseline (TB and TM) having
an average TPR of 0.975 and a TNR of 1.0 in diagnosing the
patients, meaning that we can rely on their diagnosis.
The top of Fig. 11 summarizes the attack success rates for
the blind trial. In general, the attack had an average success
rate of 99.2% for cancer injection and 95.8% for cancer
removal. The AI was fooled completely which is an important
aspect since some radiologists use AI tools to support their
analysis (e.g. the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution). The
radiologists were fooled less so, primarily due to human error
(e.g., missing a nodule). When asked, none of the radiologists
reported anything abnormal with the scans with the exception
