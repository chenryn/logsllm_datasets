## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel key-revocation scheme for ad hoc network environments, characterized by the following attributes:
- **Distributed**: Our scheme operates without the need for a permanently available central authority.
- **Active**: It incentivizes rational (selfish but honest) nodes to revoke malicious nodes.
- **Robust**: The scheme is resilient against large numbers of colluding malicious nodes (up to 30% of the network with a 15% detection error rate).
- **Detection Error Tolerant**: Revocation decisions are based on intrusion detection systems (IDS). Our scheme remains effective for any meaningful IDS (with an error rate < 0.5) and is robust for an IDS error rate up to 29%.

Existing schemes in the literature typically possess only two of these four characteristics, and the fourth characteristic is often unexplored. This work is the first to integrate all four, making it well-suited for dynamic, bandwidth-constrained ad hoc networks where many nodes operate under the threat of compromise.

## Introduction
Key revocation is a critical key management operation that enforces limitations on a key's use. In Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs), compromised nodes can divert and monitor traffic, influence quorum-based decisions, or spread harmful information. Agile revocation schemes are essential to mitigate the damage caused by such nodes.

Unlike wired networks, revocation in MANETs must be fully distributed due to the lack of a permanently available, global monitoring authority. Resource-constrained nodes must make risk-based key revocation decisions without direct contact with a central authority. These decisions are based on probabilistic results from their intrusion detection systems (IDS).

One widely cited method for achieving revocation in MANETs is quorum-based decision making using k-out-of-n threshold signatures. However, setting the threshold too high can prevent revocation, while setting it too low can allow malicious adversaries to control the network.

To address these issues, the concept of node suicide was introduced, where a single node can unilaterally revoke another node at the cost of being revoked itself. However, in heterogeneous, coalition networks, it may be unreasonable to assume that each node will value the network's utility more than its own. Without sufficient incentive, selfish nodes will defer revocation responsibility, leading to the persistence of malicious nodes.

This observation leads us to Mandeville’s "The Fable of the Bees," which posits that self-interest dominates behavioral norms. Through skillful management of individual selfish desires, public benefit may emerge. We adopt this view in our revocation scheme.

## Related Work
Most revocation schemes in the ad hoc networking literature focus on the process of arriving at a revocation decision. These approaches include collaborative, systemic, and unilateral decision-making processes. Collaborative schemes involve nodes casting negative votes against misbehaving nodes, while systemic schemes use Identity-based Public Key Infrastructures (ID-PKIs) with periodic key renewals. Unilateral decision-making, introduced by Rivest, involves nodes declaring their keys invalid upon detecting compromise.

The concept of unilateral revocation through suicide has been extended for use in ad hoc networks, where a node can instigate a "suicide-bombing" on a perceived malicious node. However, these schemes rely on nodes valuing the network's utility more than their own, which is often unrealistic. Raya et al. introduced a "social cost" to incentivize suicide, but provided no clear definition or adversary model. We argue that a "social cost" is insufficient and introduce the notion of karmic-suicide, which incorporates both false positives and false negatives in node-level IDS mechanisms.

## Problem Definition
### Design Requirements
- **Distributed**: A periodically available network authority that cannot monitor operational minutiae.
- **Active**: Encourages selfish nodes to commit suicide for the good of the network.
- **Robustness**: Resilient against a large number of cooperating, malicious nodes.
- **Detection Error Tolerant**: Capable of handling realistic errors in node-level IDS.
- **Agility**: Reacts quickly to node misbehavior.
- **Scalability**: Works irrespective of the size and density of the network.

### Assumptions
- **Node Identifiers**: Nodes can have multiple identifiers with corresponding private keys.
- **Selﬁshness**: All honest nodes behave selfishly and aim to maximize their utility.
- **Network Longevity**: The network will be in operation for a non-negligible period.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Nodes run IDS to detect malicious behavior.
- **Network Infrastructure**: Facilitates signing and sending authenticated messages.

### Adversary Model
Adversaries aim to maximize their influence during the network's lifetime, measured by the total attack time. They try to maximize attack intensity while considering the risk of detection and revocation. Adversaries may attempt to abuse the revocation scheme to obtain more identifiers and pool resources to overwhelm quorum-based mechanisms. We assume that less than 50% of the network's identifiers are controlled by the adversary.

## Revocation by Karmic-Suicide
To overcome the barrier of selfishness in suicide-based revocation schemes, we propose a karmic-suicide scheme motivated by the belief that a promise of reward in an "afterlife" can incentivize sacrifice. 

### Protocol and Parameter Specification
Nodes monitor their neighborhoods using IDS to collect evidence of malicious behavior. The IDS output for node \( j \) from node \( i \) is a normalized score \( 0 \leq \text{ids}_{ij} \leq 1 \), where 0.5 is neutral, and higher scores indicate honesty. Each node derives an opinion \( o_{ij} \) from this score. For simplicity, we assume:

\[ o_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \text{ids}_{ij} > 0.5 \\
-1 & \text{if } \text{ids}_{ij} < 0.5 \\
0 & \text{if } \text{ids}_{ij} = 0.5 
\end{cases} \]

If a node detects malicious behavior, it can initiate a karmic-suicide. A periodically available Trust Authority (TA) rewards a node for a justified suicide by reactivating it. If the judgment system cannot determine whether a suicide was justified, it can reactivate both parties without reward or engage in remedial action.

Using a k-means clustering algorithm, we derive bounds on the difference in behavior to partition malicious nodes from honest ones. We establish globally optimal strategies for colluding, malicious nodes attempting to abuse the judgment mechanism. Our analysis shows that the judgment system is secure for IDS error rates of 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% if the ratio of malicious to honest nodes is at most 38%, 31%, 22%, and 11%, respectively.

We also investigate the relationship between the IDS error rate and network density in determining the agility of the revocation process using game-theoretic analysis. Smaller IDS errors and greater network density yield a more accelerated revocation process, resulting in a more resilient and reliable network.

## Conclusion
This paper presents a new karmic-suicide revocation scheme for ad hoc networks. Our scheme overcomes the disincentive to sacrifice utility for collective gain by rewarding justified suicides. We show that our scheme provides sufficient incentives for honest nodes to revoke malicious nodes while being resilient to abuse by colluding malicious nodes. Future work will focus on further refining the judgment mechanism and exploring additional incentive structures.
