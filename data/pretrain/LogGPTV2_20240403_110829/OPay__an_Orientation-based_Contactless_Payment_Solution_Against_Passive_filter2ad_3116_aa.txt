ABSTRACT
The usage of contactless payment has surged in recent years, es-
pecially during the Covid19 pandemic. A Passive relay (PR) attack
against a contactless card is a well-known threat, which has been
extensively studied in the past with many solutions available. How-
ever, with the mass deployment of mobile point-of-sale (mPoS)
devices, there emerges a new threat, which we call mPoS-based pas-
sive (MP) attacks. In an MP attack, the various components required
in a PR attack, including an NFC reader, a wireless link, a remote
card emulator, and a remote payment terminal, are conveniently
combined into one compact device, hence the attack becomes much
easier. Since the attacker and the victim are in the same location,
the previous distance bounding or ambient sensor-based solutions
are no longer effective. In this paper, we propose a new orientation-
based payment solution called OPay. OPay builds on the observation
that when a user makes a legitimate contactless payment, the card
and the terminal surface are naturally aligned, but in an attack
scenario, this situation is less likely to occur. This allows us to
distinguish the legitimate payments from passive attacks based on
measuring the alignment of orientations. We build a concrete pro-
totype using two Arduino boards embedded with NFC and motion
sensors to act as a card and a payment terminal respectively. To
evaluate the feasibility, we recruited twenty volunteers in a user
study. Participants generally find OPay easy to use, fast and reliable.
Experiments show that OPay can substantially reduce the attack
success rate by 85-99% with little inconvenience to real users. To
our best knowledge, OPay is the first solution that can prevent both
the PR and MP attacks, while preserving the existing usage model
in contactless payment.

1 INTRODUCTION
Contactless payment is a widely deployed technology that uses
Near Field Communication (NFC) for making transactions. In a
contactless transaction, two entities are involved: a tag and a reader.
A tag is embedded in a payment device (e.g., credit/debit cards,
mobile phones and key fobs), and a reader is a point-of-sale (PoS)
terminal that communicates with the payment device via NFC.
It is well known that existing contactless cards are vulnerable
to passive relay (PR) attacks [2, 9, 12, 13, 27]. In this attack, an
attacker uses an NFC reader to interrogate a victim’s card in close
proximity and relays the card’s response to a remote card emulator
via a wireless link to make a purchase at a remote payment terminal.
Due to the passive nature of contactless cards, anyone who is near
the victim can launch this attack without the victim’s awareness.
The user may discover this attack later when they receive the bank
statements, but the money has already been stolen. Such attacks
can be difficult to trace, especially when the payments are made at
unattended terminals, e.g., a self-service kiosk [26].
Passive attacks against contactless cards have become increas-
ingly concerning in recent years for two reasons. First, the spending
limit for a contactless payment has increased significantly. When
contactless cards were first introduced in the UK in 2007, they were
limited to only £10 in a transaction. However, this limit quickly rose
to £20 in 2012, £30 in 2015, £45 in 2020, and it will increase to £100
by the end of 2021 as announced by the UK Treasury [14]. With the
increasing limit, contactless cards are becoming a more attractive
target. Second, the number of mobile PoS (mPoS) terminals has
been quickly growing, e.g., Sumup 1, Square2, and iZettle3. These
devices are compact, low-cost, wireless, and easy to set up. They en-
able anyone who has a bank account to set up a payment terminal.
While mPoS devices bring great convenience to retailers and small
businesses to set up their own payment terminals, they can also
be easily misused. We use the Sumup device as an example. In our
experiments, we entered an arbitrary amount under the spending
limit on a Sumup device and were able to discretely deduct the
amount from a user’s card which was kept in their bag or pocket.
This proof-of-concept attack was tested against the cards of the au-
thors, but the same attack can be trivially extended to steal money
from anyone.
Currently, the primary countermeasure implemented in Sumup
and other mPoS devices is making an audible “beep” sound when a

payment is made. This serves to alert the card owner that a trans-
action has been made. However, with the example of Sumup, we
show that the beep sound can be easily muted through reverse-
engineering the Sumup app (which we explain later). A secondary
countermeasure is to trace the bank account associated with the
mPoS terminal and hopefully recover the stolen money. However,
numerous examples of frauds in the banking industry suggest that
recovering stolen money is not any easy task [1]. For example, at-
tackers may use mPoS terminals to wirelessly steal money from
people in multiple crowded places like train stations, shopping
malls, or concerts, at the same time, so that they can steal a signif-
icant amount of money within a short period of time. They will
simply withdraw or transfer out the money before being discovered.
In reality, criminals often hire unsuspecting (young and old) people
as mules and use their bank accounts as intermediaries to transfer
illicit funds. All these make it difficult to trace the real attackers.
We consider an mPoS-based passive (MP) attack as a new form
of passive attacks. To some extent, an MP attack can be seen as
a variant of the PR attack. A PR attack involves an NFC reader, a
wireless link, a remote card emulator, and a remote terminal. In an
MP attack, these different parts are conveniently combined into
one compact mPoS device. This greatly reduces the sophistication
of the equipment and skills required to carry out an attack.
As a result of this new variant of the passive attack, many solu-
tions proposed in the past to defend against PR attacks are no longer
effective. Common solutions in the literature are based on the as-
sumption that the victim’s card and the real terminal are far apart
in two distinct environments. More concretely, they adopt distance-
bounding protocols [8] or use sensors to measure the ambient
environment (e.g., temperature [25], light [18], audio [18, 30], hu-
midity [25], GPS [30], magnetic field [19] and infrared light [15, 17])
to ensure the two devices are in close proximity. However, in an
MP attack, the fact that the card and the mPoS terminal are already
in close proximity renders these solutions ineffective.
Besides the distance-bounding and ambient-sensor-based so-
lutions, some researchers proposed to prevent the PR attacks by
involving explicit user actions to activate the payment processes.
For example, Tap-Tap and Pay (TTP) [23] requires a user to gently
tap the card (or the mobile phone) against the terminal twice in
succession to initiate a contactless payment. Shake on It (Shot) [29]
requires the NFC card and the reader to be held together to estab-
lish a physical contact via accelerators and vibrators. Proximity
and Relay Attack Detection (PRAD) [16] works by requiring the
user to press buttons on NFC devices to activate the transaction.
While these solutions are useful in certain applications, they are less
suitable in the context of contactless payment since they modify
the usage model of how a user normally makes a contactless card
payment.
To effectively prevent passive attacks against contactless cards,
a practical solution should satisfy the following requirements. First,
it should prevent both PR and MP attacks, taking into account that
the victim’s card and the real terminal may be in close proximity
and in the same environment. Second, it should be fast, allowing
the transaction to be completed within 500 ms according to the
EMV requirement [15]. Third, it should preserve the usage model,
allowing users to naturally complete a transaction as normal.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing solution which
satisfies all of these requirements. Therefore, we present a solution
that meets this goal. Without loss of generality, we focus on the
more dangerous MP attack, but the same solution is also applicable
for preventing the PR attack. The key idea in our solution is to
make use of the accelerator and gyroscope sensors to derive the
orientation of an NFC device. When a user makes a contactless
payment by placing the card on the top or in front of an mPoS
terminal, the orientations of the card and the terminal are naturally
aligned. However, in an attack scenario where the victim’s card
is in a bag or pocket, the card and the terminal are less likely to
be aligned. Hence, based on analyzing the orientations, we can
tell a legitimate payment apart from an illegitimate one. We also
build a concrete prototype and conduct a user study to evaluate the
feasibility of our solution. The user study indicates that our solution
is easy to use, and can substantially reduce the attack success rate
from the current 100% to only 1-15%, whiling incurring only a
small 4.76% false rejection rate. We summarize our contributions
as follows.
• We present OPay, an orientation-based payment solution
against passive attacks in contactless payments. Our solution
is the first that addresses both PR and MP attacks, supports
a fast transaction under 500 ms, and does not change the
usage model.
• We build a concrete prototype of OPay by using Arduino
boards with embedded NFC, accelerometer, and gyroscope
sensors to implement a payment card and a terminal respec-
tively. All our code is open source here.
• We conduct user studies to evaluate the usability and per-
formance of our OPay prototype. The studies show that our
solution is easy to use with low false positive and negative
rates.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
discuss the overview of mPoS terminals and their vulnerabilities.
In Section 3, we describe the threat model and the OPay system,
followed by the system prototype and evaluation in Section 4. OPay
is compared with related work in Section 5. We finally discuss the
limitations and future work of OPay in Section 6 and conclude the
paper in Section 7.
2 MOBILE POINT-OF-SALE (MPOS)
TERMINAL
Fig. 1 shows the payment ecosystem and the relationships between
the users, merchants, and banks [24]. The issuer bank issues pay-
ment cards to the users (step 1). Each card has a shared secret key
with the issuer bank. The key is mainly used to protect the transac-
tion data via Message Authentication Code (MAC), but it can also
be used to encrypt data based on using AES and a key derivation
function [10]. A user can make a transaction in three different ways:
1) using an e-commerce service (steps 2 and 3) over the internet via
a payment gateway, 2) using a PoS terminal developed by a third
party such as a merchant PoS (step 5), or 3) using a PoS terminal
provided by the acquirer bank (step 7). The acquirer bank manages
an account for the merchant to receive and route the transaction
information (steps 4, 6, and 8) and ensures that funds are deposited
into the merchant’s account once the transaction is completed via

attack, we placed the contactless cards inside bags and used an mPoS
device to approach the bags from outside at a close distance. Our
findings show that we can always successfully trigger a contactless
payment. In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we used our own
bank cards. However, the attack can be extended to steal money
from anyone.
To prevent an mPoS terminal from making a contactless payment
deduction from an unaware user (either maliciously or by accident),
the Sumup device makes a beep sound whenever a contactless
payment is conducted. This makes a covert passive attack difficult
without alarming the user. It is possible to use a physical sound
dampener to lower the volume of the beep. However, we show we
can completely disable the beep sound by software means. Through
reverse-engineering the Sumup app and analyzing the code, we
find out that the volume of the beep sound is controlled by the
mobile phone app, in a method called paySoundEffect under the
AudioMangers class. Thus, if we can modify this method, we can
completely control the beep sound. This requires us to modify the
mPoS app; this is easily doable for the Sumup app on an Android
phone.
Modifying the Sumup app involves a few simple steps. First, we
decompile the Sumup app using two openly available tools: apktool4
and a standard Java decompiler5. The first tool produces Smali code,
while the second produces Java code. We use two different tools
as they are complementary. Smali code is more difficult to read,
therefore we use the Java code to understand the application code
and identify the part in the source code that needs to be altered. We
then make the actual change in the Smali code. The main changes
include removing the playSoundEffect method and all the calls to
it. This modification has the effect of completely muting the beep
sound. After the modified Smali code is recompiled, we use the
APK Easy tool6 to add a self-signed certificate, which is required by
Android. Finally, we install the modified app directly on the mobile
phone. We repeat the passive attack experiments and find that the
attack works as before except that the beep sound from the mPoS
terminal has been completely muted. This shows relying on a beep
sound to alert the victim is not safe and a more secure solution is
required.
3 OUR PROPOSED OPAY SYSTEM
In this section, we propose an orientation-based payment system
called OPay. The main idea of OPay is to use the orientation data of
the payment device and the mPoS terminal in order to approve or
deny a transaction based on the similarity of their measurements.
The intuition is that when a user makes a contactless payment,
the orientation of their card is naturally aligned with that of the
payment terminal. In case of an attack, when an attacker uses an
mPoS terminal to approach an uncooperative user, it is less likely
that the orientations of the two devices will be aligned. Our goal
is not to completely stop the passive attacks, but to significantly
increase the chance of detection without adding inconvenience to
users in legitimate payment scenarios.

the payment network (steps 9 and 10). In OPay, we focus on the
transactions that use PoS terminals developed by a third party (steps
1, 5, 6, 9, and 10) that require the use of a mobile phone to transmit
the data from the mPoS terminal to the issuer bank via a payment
network.
In this ecosystem, merchants can use mPoS terminals to accept
users’ payments using contact or contactless cards. These terminals
can be bought online by any individual and it takes less than 5
minutes to set up. The Sumup device that we have purchased costs
only £19. We explain the Sumup setup process in the following. The
setup processes for other mPoS products are similar.
The first step to set up a terminal is to sign up for an online
