brevity. These results, though preliminary, suggest that our obser-
vations apply to such singular events as well.

for LiveH2 and LiveH3 are almost identical and not shown for
brevity.
With respect to the average bitrate, the play time peaks around
a bitrate of 1.2 Mbps. Beyond that value, however, the engage-
ment decreases. The reason for this behavior is similar to the previ-
ous observation in Section 4.1.1. Most end-users (e.g., DSL, cable
broadband users) cannot sustain such a high bandwidth stream. As
a consequence, the player encounters buffering and also switches to
a lower bitrate midstream. As we already saw, buffering adversely
impacts the user experience.

gather buffering event data. The results are consistent with
SvodA.
4.3 Short VoD Content
Finally, we consider the short VoD category. For both datasets
SvodA and SvodB the player uses a discrete set of 2-3 bitrates
(without switching) and was not instrumented to gather buffering
event data. Thus, we do not show the AvgBitrate (it is meaningless
to compute the correlation on 2 points) and RateBuf . Figure 13
shows the distribution of the correlation coefﬁcients for SvodA and
Table 4 summarizes the median values for both datasets.
We notice similarities between long and short VoD: BufRatio
and RendQual are the most critical metrics that impact PlayTime.
Further, BufRatio and RendQual are themselves strongly corre-
lated (not shown). As before, JoinTime is weakly correlated. For
brevity, we do not show the univariate/bivariate information gain
results for short VoD because they mirror the results from the cor-
relation analysis.

ity metrics and play time for LiveA.
BufRatio values for these users is also very low. In other words,
these users have no network issues, but see a drop in RendQual,
but continue to watch the video for a long duration despite this poor
frame rate.
Figure 11: Scatter plot between the play time and rendering
quality. Notice that there are a lot of points where the rendering
quality is very low but the play time is very high.
We speculate that this counter-intuitive negative correlation be-
tween RendQual and PlayTime arises out of a combination of
two effects. The ﬁrst effect has to do with user behavior. Unlike
long VoD viewers (e.g., TV episodes), live video viewers are also
likely to run the video player in background (e.g., listening to the
sports commentary). In such situations the browser is either mini-
mized or the player is in a hidden browser tab. The second effect is
an optimization by the player to reduce the CPU consumption when
the video is being played in the background. In these cases, the
player decreases the frame rendering rate to reduce CPU use. We
replicated the above scenarios–minimizing the browser or playing
a video in a background window–in a controlled setup and found
that the player indeed drops the RendQual to 20% (e.g., rendering
6-7 out of 30 frames per second). Curiously, the PlayTime peak in
Figure 4(d) also occurs at a 20% RendQual. These controlled ex-
periments conﬁrm our hypothesis that the anomalous relationship
is in fact due to these player optimizations for users playing the
video in the background.
4.2.2 Case study with high impact events
A particular concern for live content providers is whether the
observations from typical events can be applied to high impact
events [22]. To address this concern, we consider the LiveH dataset.

viewing time.
5. VIEWER LEVEL ENGAGEMENT
Content providers also want to understand if good video quality
improves customer retention or if it encourages users to try more
videos. To address these questions we analyze the user engagement
at the viewer level in this section. For brevity, we highlight the
key results and do not duplicate the full analysis as in the previous
section.
For this analysis, we look at the number of views per viewer and
the total play time aggregated over all videos watched by the viewer
in a one week interval. Recall that at the view level we ﬁltered the
data to only look at videos with at least 1000 views. At the viewer
level, however, we look at the aggregate number of views and play
time per viewer across all objects irrespective of that video’s pop-
ularity. For each viewer we correlate the average of each quality
metric with the two engagement metrics.
Figure 15 visually conﬁrms that the quality metrics also impact
the number of views. One curious observation is that the number
of views increases in the range 1–15 seconds before starting to de-
crease. We also see a similar effect for BufRatio, where the ﬁrst
few bins have fewer total views. This effect does not, however, oc-
cur for the total play time. We speculate that this is an effect of
user interest. Many users have very good quality but little interest
in the content; they “sample” the content and leave without return-
ing. Users who are actually interested in the content are more tol-
erant of longer join times (and buffering). However, the tolerance
drops beyond a certain point (around 15 seconds for JoinTime).
Figure 16 summarizes the values of the correlation coefﬁcients for
the six datasets. The values are qualitatively consistent across the
different datasets and also similar to the trends we observed at the
view level. One signiﬁcant difference is that while JoinTime is
uninteresting at the view level, it has a more pronounced impact
(b) Actual values (signed)

cient between the quality metrics and play time for SvodA. We
do not show AvgBitrate and RateBuf because the player did
not switch bitrates and did not gather buffering event data.
4.4 Quantitative Impact
As we discussed earlier and as our measurements so far high-
light, the interaction between the PlayTime and the quality metrics
can be quite complex. Thus, we avoid blindly applying quantitative
regression models on our dataset. Instead, we only apply regression
when we can visually conﬁrm that this has a meaningful real-world
interpretation and when the relationship is roughly linear. Thus, we
restrict this analysis to the most critical metric, BufRatio. Further,
we only apply regression to the 0-10% range of BufRatio, where
we conﬁrmed a simple linear relationship.
We notice that the distribution of the linear-ﬁt slopes are very
similar within the same content type in Figure 14. The median
magnitudes of the slopes are one for long VoD, two for live, and
close to zero for short VoD. That is, BufRatio has the strongest
quantitative impact on live, then on long VoD, then on short VoD.
Figure 12(a) also includes linear data ﬁts on the 0-10% subrange
for BufRatio for the LiveH data. These show that, within the se-
lected subrange, a 1% increase in BufRatio can reduce the average
play time by more than three minutes (assuming a game duration
of 90 minutes). Conversely, providers can increase the average user
engagement by more than three minutes by investing resources to
reduce BufRatio by 1%.

by the quality metrics.
Summary of viewer-level analysis:
• Both the number of views and the total play time are impacted
• The quality metrics that impact the view level engagement con-
sistently impact the viewer level engagement. We conﬁrm that
these results are consistent across different datasets.
• The correlation between the engagement metrics and the qual-
ity metrics becomes visually and quantitatively even more strik-
ing at the viewer level.
• Additionally, the join time, which seemed less relevant at the
view level, has non-trivial impact at the viewer level.

on the total play time at the viewer level. This has interesting sys-
tem design implications. For example, consider a scenario where a
provider decides to increase the buffer size to alleviate the buffering
issues. However, increasing buffer size can increase join time. The
above result shows that doing so without evaluating the impact at
the viewer level may be counterproductive, as increasing the buffer
size may reduce the likelihood of a viewer visiting the site again.
As with the view-level analysis, we complement the qualitative
correlations with quantitative results. Figure 17 shows linear data
ﬁtting for the total play time as a function of the buffering ratio
for LvodA and LiveA. This shows that reducing BufRatio by 1%
translates to an effective increase the total play time by 1.2 minutes
for long VoD content and by 2.4 minutes for live content on average
per user.
6. DISCUSSION
The ﬁndings presented in this paper are the result of an iterative
process that included more false starts and misleading interpreta-
tions than we care to admit. We present two of the main lessons we
learned in this process. Then, we discuss an important direction of
future research for Internet video measurement.
6.1 The need for complementary analysis
All of you are right. The reason every one of you is
telling it differently is because each one of you touched
a different part of the elephant. So, actually the ele-
phant has all the features you mentioned. [10]
For the Long VoD case, we observed that the correlation coefﬁ-
cient for the average bitrate was weak, but the univariate informa-
tion gain was high. The process of trying to explain this discrep-
ancy led us to visualize the behaviors similar to Figure 3(c). In this
case, the correlation was weak because the relationship was non-
monotone. The information gain, however, was high because the
intermediate bins near the natural modes had signiﬁcantly lower
engagement and consequently low entropy in the play time distri-
bution.
This observation guided us to a different phenomenon, sessions
that were forced to switch rates because of poor network quality.

ysis, we may have missed this effect and incorrectly inferred that
AvgBitrate was not important. This highlights the value of using
multiple views from complementary analysis techniques in dealing
with large datasets.
6.2 The importance of context
Lies, damned lies, and statistics
Our second lesson is that while statistical data mining techniques
are excellent tools, they need to be used with caution and with a ju-
dicious appreciation of the context in which they are applied. That
is, we need to take the results of these analysis together with the
context of the human and operating factors. For example, naively
acting on the observation that the rendering quality is negatively
correlated for live content can lead to an incorrect understanding
of its impact on engagement. As we saw, this negative correla-
tion is the outcome of both user behavior and player optimizations.
Users who intend to watch a live event for a long time may run
these in background windows; the player cognizant of this back-
ground window effect tries to reduce CPU consumption by reduc-
ing the rendering quality. This highlights the importance of backing
