User: I have a specific folder in which I download certain .zip files. I am writing a python script to automate the unzip, upload, and deletion of files from this folder. Is there a way to automatically trigger my python script each time a zip file is downloaded to this folder?
[EDIT] : i am on osx mavericks, sorry for not mentioning this from the start
Assistant: The easiest way I can think of:
Make a cronjob lets say every 1 minute, that launches a script to check the directory in question for any new zip files.
If found it will trigger unziping, upload and deletion.
if you don't want to create a cronjob you can always think about creating a daemon (but why bother)
