User: Every time I restart the shell or run a script and instance of pythonw.exe*32 is created.  When I close out of IDLE these processes don't go away in the task manager.  Any ideas on how to fix this?
Thanks!
Assistant: Have you tried using python.exe instead of pythonw.exe?
Im pretty sure this is the intended default behavior for the window python interperter (pythonw.exe).
If its a .pyw file, just right click "Open With..." and use python.exe
