Question: An attacker is attempting to exploit a memory-safety vulnerability in a program that implements non-executable pages. The attacker decides to use the 'Return into libc' technique. Which of the following steps would the attacker likely take to successfully execute arbitrary code using a function from the C standard library?
"A": "Overwrite the stack pointer to redirect execution to the attacker's code in the heap.",
"B": "Overwrite the return instruction pointer (rip) with the address of a legitimate C library function.",
"C": "Place the arguments for the C library function in a non-standard register to bypass non-executable page protections.",
"D": "Carefully place the desired arguments on the stack in the correct order for the C library function to use when executed."
