Abstract—Digital security compliance programs and policies
serve as powerful tools for protecting organizations’ intellectual
property, sensitive resources, customers, and employees through
mandated security controls. Organizations place a signiﬁcant
emphasis on compliance and often conﬂate high compliance audit
scores with strong security; however, no compliance standard has
been systemically evaluated for security concerns that may exist
even within fully-compliant organizations. In this study, we de-
scribe our approach for auditing three exemplar compliance stan-
dards that affect nearly every person within the United States:
standards for federal tax information, credit card transactions,
and the electric grid. We partner with organizations that use these
standards to validate our ﬁndings within enterprise environments
and provide ﬁrst-hand narratives describing impact.
We ﬁnd that when compliance standards are used literally
as checklists — a common occurrence, as conﬁrmed by compli-
ance experts — their technical controls and processes are not
always sufﬁcient. Security concerns can exist even with perfect
compliance. We identiﬁed 148 issues of varying severity across
three standards; our expert partners assessed 49 of these issues
and validated that 36 were present in their own environments
and 10 could plausibly occur elsewhere. We also discovered that
no clearly-deﬁned process exists for reporting security concerns
associated with compliance standards; we report on our varying
levels of success in responsibly disclosing our ﬁndings and
inﬂuencing revisions to the affected standards. Overall, our results
suggest that auditing compliance standards can provide valuable
beneﬁts to the security posture of compliant organizations.

INTRODUCTION
Many digital-security guidelines, such as those provided
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
present best practices for system owners and digital-security
technicians to improve their overall security posture [43].
These guidelines are designed to protect intellectual property,
sensitive resources, customers, and employees from security
risks. Exemplar protection mechanisms include installing anti-
virus applications on all systems and conducting background
checks on employees before providing privileged access.
Over the years, governments and organizations have elected
to adopt these guidelines as compliance controls: mandatory
policy and technical controls that must be enforced across
applicable organizations. Non-compliance with these controls
is typically followed by signiﬁcant ﬁnes, revocation of access,

or employment termination [6]. To illustrate this fact, one
energy company was recently ﬁned $10 million for non-
compliance [40].
Because of these sometimes-hefty punishments, organiza-
tions often commit signiﬁcant personnel, time, and other re-
sources to maintaining compliance with standards and prepar-
ing for compliance audits. For example, one organization we
partnered with for this study has allocated 10% of their total
workforce to focus solely on compliance. A cursory search
in July 2019 showed job openings for compliance auditors
across many Fortune 500 companies, with salaries ranging
from $46,000 to $96,000 annually based on experience [18].
This indicates the emphasis that many companies place on
adherence to compliance standards.
Further, compliance standards are often presented as a
proven metric for improving security. The International Or-
ganization for Standardization routinely provides metrics on
how compliance standards keep users and businesses safe on-
line [29]. Some federal-level programs and businesses develop
and deploy systems that are fully compliant with established
standards as an implicit seal of security [19], [3], and some
organizations actively use digital compliance standards to
shape their defensive strategies [31], [52]. Because compliance
itself is treated as a ﬁrst-class security property (with potential
ﬁnancial penalties), standards are often used as checklists, even
if they were not written with word-literal interpretation in
mind.
Despite the signiﬁcant emphasis placed on compliance with
these standards, their actual efﬁcacy is not well understood.
While they may provide important security beneﬁts, it is also
possible that they lull security practitioners into a false sense
of security, conﬂating high compliance audit scores with strong
security. It is also possible that standards which are useful as
general guidelines can become problematic when interpreted
legalistically as checklist requirements. In this paper, we report
on a two-part study investigating these questions.
First, we conducted a line-by-line audit of three publicly
available, widely-adopted compliance standards that affect
anyone in the United States who pays federal taxes, con-
ducts credit card transactions, or uses electricity: Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 1075 (P1075), the Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the
North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Crit-
ical Infrastructure Protection for system security management
(CIP 007-6). We applied rigorous content-analysis techniques
adapted from social science to identify security concerns and
categorize them based on root cause and estimated risk levels.
In the context of this paper, we deﬁne security concerns as any
security control or policy within a compliance standard that
can lead to sub-optimal security conditions when implemented
as written. We then partnered with experts who conﬁrmed (or
rejected) a subset of our results based on their past experience:
two experts from New York City Cyber Command (for P1075),
a CIP framework co-author, and a PCI standards council
member.
Despite organizations such as NIST insisting that compli-
ance programs were never intended to be used as audit check-
lists, all four of our compliance experts reported ﬁrst-hand
experience with auditors using compliance documents as line-
by-line checklists, supporting our decision to treat them as such
for analysis purposes [38]. We identiﬁed 148 security concerns
across the three standards that our researchers assessed would
exist when organizations follow compliance programs “by-the-
letter.”
These security concerns range in risk (assessed based on
probability of occurrence and associated severity) from low to
extremely high and include issues relating to vague require-
ments, outdated technology, and improperly protecting sen-
sitive information. Some security concerns could potentially
be addressed with straightforward rewrites of the standards
and minor changes at compliant organizations, while others
likely cannot be remediated without signiﬁcant, potentially
impractical, investment by affected organizations.
The compliance experts validated our ﬁndings, conﬁrming
36 of 49 as deﬁnite security concerns and 10 as plausible, while
rejecting only three. Further, compliance experts conﬁrmed
that problems like poorly deﬁned time windows and unclear
division of responsibility — trends we observed across the
three standards we examined — can manifest in real-world
ways that increase risks.
In Section VII, we discuss our efforts to responsibly
disclose our ﬁndings. Our experience reveals that no viable
process for reporting exists. Despite this, our ﬁndings have
already resulted in one change in PCI DSS standards and are
being included in discussion for further updates to both PCI
DSS and CIP.
To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to systematically as-
sess multiple compliance standards for insecure practices and
identify a range of associated security concerns that may occur
within compliant enterprise organizations. Our results highlight
the difﬁculty of establishing standards that are responsive to
the fast-moving security space, general enough to apply in
multiple contexts, and robust enough to use as line-by-line
checklists for compliance auditing. Accordingly, we provide
recommendations for improving compliance standards and the
overall compliance ecosystem.
II. BACKGROUND
Digital security compliance programs within the United
States date back to the Computer Security Act of 1987, which
required agencies to protect sensitive systems and conduct
security training [39]. Many programs implement a “carrot-
and-stick” approach to compliance, in that organizations are
rewarded for successful programs and levied with sanctions for
compliance deviations. In this section, we brieﬂy review past
studies involving digital security compliance and its impact on
organizations.
Compliance audits force organizations to balance being
“inspection ready” and sustaining daily operations, such as
providing essential services or selling goods. Because of this
careful balance, many organizations choose to perform com-
pliance actions only before a pending audit, and then neglect
further security maintenance until another audit requires them
to repeat the process [46]. This behavior meets the security
minimums for compliance standards, but fails to adhere to
the spirit of secure practices. Moreover, evidence shows that
fully-compliant organizations can still suffer data breaches.
Auditors certiﬁed Target as PCI-compliant in September 2013,
just before it suffered a massive data breach in November
2013 [46]. We highlight sections of compliance standards
that may permit similar incidents to occur again and provide
recommendations for mitigation.
Previous studies highlight cultural disconnects between de-
velopers, engineers, and compliance ofﬁcials that create issues
when digital security measures are “bolted on” after software
development is complete [12], [7]. To combat these issues,
entities must ﬁnd ways to overcome organizational behaviors
and factors that affect secure software development [56].
Some organizations have embedded compliance experts within
development teams to encourage grass-roots-style compliance
integration [12]. Other organizations found that threat model-
ing could proactively identify security gaps that may exist in
compliant solutions [12], [4]. Some organizations have even
overhauled their physical network topology to meet federally-
mandated requirements, restructuring their teams and network
architecture to limit the scope of auditable systems within their
environment [26]. This, too, meets the letter of compliance
requirements while seeming to contradict the intended goals. In
this study, we identify several unintended security implications
within technical controls and implementation processes that
could affect organizations as they alter their normal business
practices for compliance adherence.
Numerous studies focus on how humans perceive com-
pliance standards and modify their behaviors based on those
perceptions. Julisch highlighted numerous factors that shape
organizational decision-making when investing in compliance
measures, often seeking new security technologies that are out-
of-the-box compliance ready [31]. Beautement et al. describe
the “compliance budget,” the human factors behind the imple-
mentation of compliance controls; their research illuminated
ways to improve security and compliance readiness through
resource allocation optimization [8]. Building upon previous
works, Puhakainen and Siponen found that training employees
to better understand compliance standards can improve orga-
nizational behaviors and shift employees toward implementing
more secure practices [48]. Additionally, Hu et al. found
that managers who “lead by example” and implement top-
down management initiatives encourage employees’ compliant
security behaviors [24]. Our study is a signiﬁcant departure
from previous studies, as we do not focus on improving
adoption rates within organizations. Instead, in this study we
assume organizations are 100% compliant with the letter of
the standard and focus on the insecure practices and security
concerns that may exist anyway.
