## Abstract
Digital security compliance programs and policies serve as essential tools for protecting organizations' intellectual property, sensitive resources, customers, and employees through mandated security controls. Organizations often place significant emphasis on compliance, frequently equating high compliance audit scores with strong security. However, no compliance standard has been systematically evaluated for potential security concerns that may exist even within fully-compliant organizations. In this study, we describe our approach to auditing three prominent compliance standards that affect nearly every person in the United States: standards for federal tax information, credit card transactions, and the electric grid. We collaborate with organizations that use these standards to validate our findings within enterprise environments and provide firsthand narratives describing their impact.

We find that when compliance standards are used literally as checklists—a common practice, as confirmed by compliance experts—their technical controls and processes are not always sufficient. Security concerns can persist even with perfect compliance. We identified 148 issues of varying severity across the three standards; our expert partners assessed 49 of these issues and validated that 36 were present in their own environments, while 10 could plausibly occur elsewhere. We also discovered that there is no clearly defined process for reporting security concerns associated with compliance standards. We report on our varying levels of success in responsibly disclosing our findings and influencing revisions to the affected standards. Overall, our results suggest that auditing compliance standards can provide valuable benefits to the security posture of compliant organizations.

## I. Introduction
Many digital-security guidelines, such as those provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), offer best practices for system owners and digital-security technicians to enhance their overall security posture [43]. These guidelines aim to protect intellectual property, sensitive resources, customers, and employees from security risks. Common protection mechanisms include installing antivirus applications on all systems and conducting background checks on employees before providing privileged access.

Over the years, governments and organizations have adopted these guidelines as compliance controls: mandatory policy and technical controls that must be enforced across applicable organizations. Non-compliance typically results in significant fines, revocation of access, or employment termination [6]. For example, one energy company was recently fined $10 million for non-compliance [40].

Due to these sometimes hefty penalties, organizations often commit significant personnel, time, and other resources to maintaining compliance and preparing for audits. One organization we partnered with for this study has allocated 10% of their total workforce to focus solely on compliance. A search in July 2019 revealed numerous job openings for compliance auditors at many Fortune 500 companies, with salaries ranging from $46,000 to $96,000 annually based on experience [18]. This highlights the importance that many companies place on adherence to compliance standards.

Furthermore, compliance standards are often presented as a proven metric for improving security. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) routinely provides metrics on how compliance standards keep users and businesses safe online [29]. Some federal-level programs and businesses develop and deploy systems that are fully compliant with established standards as an implicit seal of security [19], [3]. Some organizations actively use digital compliance standards to shape their defensive strategies [31], [52]. Because compliance is treated as a first-class security property (with potential financial penalties), standards are often used as checklists, even if they were not intended for word-literal interpretation.

Despite the significant emphasis placed on compliance, the actual efficacy of these standards is not well understood. While they may provide important security benefits, it is also possible that they lull security practitioners into a false sense of security, conflating high compliance audit scores with strong security. It is also possible that standards useful as general guidelines can become problematic when interpreted legalistically as checklist requirements. In this paper, we report on a two-part study investigating these questions.

First, we conducted a line-by-line audit of three publicly available, widely-adopted compliance standards that affect anyone in the United States who pays federal taxes, conducts credit card transactions, or uses electricity: Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 1075 (P1075), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection for system security management (CIP 007-6). We applied rigorous content-analysis techniques adapted from social science to identify security concerns and categorize them based on root cause and estimated risk levels.

In the context of this paper, we define security concerns as any security control or policy within a compliance standard that can lead to sub-optimal security conditions when implemented as written. We then partnered with experts who confirmed (or rejected) a subset of our results based on their past experience: two experts from New York City Cyber Command (for P1075), a CIP framework co-author, and a PCI standards council member.

Despite organizations such as NIST insisting that compliance programs were never intended to be used as audit checklists, all four of our compliance experts reported firsthand experience with auditors using compliance documents as line-by-line checklists, supporting our decision to treat them as such for analysis purposes [38]. We identified 148 security concerns across the three standards that our researchers assessed would exist when organizations follow compliance programs "by-the-letter."

These security concerns range in risk (assessed based on probability of occurrence and associated severity) from low to extremely high and include issues relating to vague requirements, outdated technology, and improperly protecting sensitive information. Some security concerns could potentially be addressed with straightforward rewrites of the standards and minor changes at compliant organizations, while others likely cannot be remediated without significant, potentially impractical, investment by affected organizations.

The compliance experts validated our findings, confirming 36 of 49 as definite security concerns and 10 as plausible, while rejecting only three. Further, compliance experts confirmed that problems like poorly defined time windows and unclear division of responsibility—trends observed across the three standards—can manifest in real-world ways that increase risks.

In Section VII, we discuss our efforts to responsibly disclose our findings. Our experience reveals that no viable process for reporting exists. Despite this, our findings have already resulted in one change in PCI DSS standards and are being included in discussions for further updates to both PCI DSS and CIP.

To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically assess multiple compliance standards for insecure practices and identify a range of associated security concerns that may occur within compliant enterprise organizations. Our results highlight the difficulty of establishing standards that are responsive to the fast-moving security space, general enough to apply in multiple contexts, and robust enough to use as line-by-line checklists for compliance auditing. Accordingly, we provide recommendations for improving compliance standards and the overall compliance ecosystem.

## II. Background
Digital security compliance programs in the United States date back to the Computer Security Act of 1987, which required agencies to protect sensitive systems and conduct security training [39]. Many programs implement a "carrot-and-stick" approach to compliance, rewarding successful programs and levying sanctions for deviations. In this section, we briefly review past studies involving digital security compliance and its impact on organizations.

Compliance audits force organizations to balance being "inspection ready" and sustaining daily operations, such as providing essential services or selling goods. Many organizations choose to perform compliance actions only before a pending audit, then neglect further security maintenance until another audit requires them to repeat the process [46]. This behavior meets the minimum security requirements for compliance but fails to adhere to the spirit of secure practices. Moreover, evidence shows that fully-compliant organizations can still suffer data breaches. Auditors certified Target as PCI-compliant in September 2013, just before it suffered a massive data breach in November 2013 [46]. We highlight sections of compliance standards that may permit similar incidents to occur again and provide recommendations for mitigation.

Previous studies highlight cultural disconnects between developers, engineers, and compliance officials that create issues when digital security measures are "bolted on" after software development is complete [12], [7]. To combat these issues, entities must find ways to overcome organizational behaviors and factors that affect secure software development [56]. Some organizations have embedded compliance experts within development teams to encourage grassroots-style compliance integration [12]. Other organizations found that threat modeling can proactively identify security gaps that may exist in compliant solutions [12], [4]. Some organizations have even overhauled their physical network topology to meet federally-mandated requirements, restructuring their teams and network architecture to limit the scope of auditable systems within their environment [26]. This meets the letter of compliance requirements but seems to contradict the intended goals. In this study, we identify several unintended security implications within technical controls and implementation processes that could affect organizations as they alter their normal business practices for compliance adherence.

Numerous studies focus on how humans perceive compliance standards and modify their behaviors based on those perceptions. Julisch highlighted numerous factors that shape organizational decision-making when investing in compliance measures, often seeking new security technologies that are out-of-the-box compliance-ready [31]. Beautement et al. describe the "compliance budget," the human factors behind the implementation of compliance controls; their research illuminated ways to improve security and compliance readiness through resource allocation optimization [8]. Building upon previous works, Puhakainen and Siponen found that training employees to better understand compliance standards can improve organizational behaviors and shift employees toward implementing more secure practices [48]. Additionally, Hu et al. found that managers who "lead by example" and implement top-down management initiatives encourage employees' compliant security behaviors [24]. Our study is a significant departure from previous studies, as we do not focus on improving adoption rates within organizations. Instead, we assume organizations are 100% compliant with the letter of the standard and focus on the insecure practices and security concerns that may exist anyway.
