User: I found this error [Error 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application when i run this python command windll.LoadLibrary("C:\Windows\System32\plcommpro.dll")
For this error i found my plcommpro.dll file is not executable file.But I don't know how to make it as a executable file.If someone knows please share me.
Thanks and Best.
Assistant: If you are using a 32 bit Python and the DLL is a 64 bit DLL you will get this error, likewise if the DLL is 32 bit and your Python is 64 bit.
You can check this using the dumpbin /HEADERS <dll filepath> command from a visual studio command prompt.
