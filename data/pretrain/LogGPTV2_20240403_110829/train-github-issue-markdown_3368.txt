## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
# Expected Behavior
We upgraded from celery version 4.4.6 to 4.4.7, everything was working fine on
4.4.6.
# Actual Behavior
After upgrading, we failed to start the worker service because "--app"
parameter is not loaded from "ExecStart" command. Beat service works well with
"--app" though. We downgraded back to 4.4.6 and it works fine again.
