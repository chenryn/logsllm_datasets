## Environment & Settings
- **Celery Version**: 4.4.7
- **`celery report` Output**:
  ```
  # Paste the output of `celery -A proj report` here
  ```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Upgrade from Celery 4.4.6 to 4.4.7.
2. Attempt to start the worker service using the `--app` parameter in the `ExecStart` command.

## Required Dependencies
- **Minimal Python Version**: 3.8.2
- **Minimal Celery Version**: 4.4.6
- **Minimal Kombu Version**: N/A or Unknown
- **Minimal Broker Version**: N/A or Unknown
- **Minimal Result Backend Version**: N/A or Unknown
- **Minimal OS and/or Kernel Version**: Ubuntu
- **Minimal Broker Client Version**: N/A or Unknown
- **Minimal Result Backend Client Version**: N/A or Unknown

### Python Packages
- **`pip freeze` Output**:
  ```plaintext
  amqp==2.6.1
  celery==4.4.7
  kombu==4.6.11
  redis==3.5.3
  ```

### Other Dependencies
- N/A

## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
- Provide a minimal test case that can be used to reproduce the issue.

## Expected Behavior
- The worker service should start successfully with the `--app` parameter in the `ExecStart` command, as it did in Celery 4.4.6.

## Actual Behavior
- After upgrading to Celery 4.4.7, the worker service fails to start because the `--app` parameter is not loaded from the `ExecStart` command. The beat service, however, works correctly with the `--app` parameter. Downgrading back to Celery 4.4.6 resolves the issue.
