of the criminal... " (1895). 
Durkheim recognized deviance as important to the well-being of society and proposed 
that challenges to established moral and legal laws (deviance and crime, respectively) 
acted to unify the law-abiding. Recognition and punishment of crimes is, in effect, the 
very reaffirmation of the laws and moral boundaries of a society. The existence of laws 
and the strength thereof are upheld by members of a society when violations are 
recognized, discussed, and dealt with either by legal punishment (jail, fines, execution) or 
by social punishment (shame, exile).  
Crime actually produces social solidarity, rather than weakens it.  Durkheim also 
proposed that crime and deviance brought people in a society together. When a law is 
violated, especially within small communities, everyone talks about it. Meetings are 
sometimes held, articles are written for local news publications, and in general, a social 
community bristles with activity when a norm is broken. As is most often the case, a 
violation incites the non-violators (society as a whole) to cling together in opposition to 
the violation, reaffirming that society's bond and its adherence to certain norms.  
A third idea Durkheim held was that deviance and crime also help to promote social 
change. While most violations of norms are greeted with opposition by the masses, others 
are sometimes not, and those violations that gain support often are re-examined by that 
society. Often, those activities that once were considered deviant, are reconsidered and 
become part of the norms, simply because they gained support by a large portion of the 
society. In sum, deviance can help a society to rethink its boundaries, and move toward 
social change, hopefully for the greater benefit of the group.  
Durkheim on Crime  
"There is no society that is not confronted with the problem of criminality. Its form 
changes; the acts thus characterized are not the same everywhere; but, everywhere 
and always, there have been men who have behaved in such a way as to draw upon 
themselves penal repression. There is, then, no phenomenon that represents more 
indisputably all the symptoms of normality, since it appears closely connected with 
the conditions of all collective life." 
(1963, p. 62 [excerpt from The Rules of the Sociological Method])  
"...We must not say that an action shocks the conscience collective because it is criminal, 
16 
but rather that it is criminal because it shocks the conscience collective. We do not 
condemn it because it is a crime, but it is a crime because we condemn it." 
(1972, p. 123-124 [excerpt from The Division of Labor in Society])] 
"Contrary to current ideas, the criminal no longer seems a totally unsociable being, 
a sort of parasitic element, a strange and inassimilable body, introduced into the 
midst of society. On the contrary, he plays a definite role in social life. Crime, for its 
part, must no longer be conceived as an evil that cannot be too much suppressed." 
(1963, p. 63 [excerpt from The Rules of the Sociological Method]) 
You see THE IMPLICATION: WE are in collusion with criminals on behalf of the 
FUNCTIONING of society as is, as it will.  
Example: extortion is a cost of doing business – but don’t kill the cow or no one can get 
milk. That is the danger of asymmetric power: nation states might not accept the 
consequences a small cadre of bad actors are willing to accept, including their own 
deaths, in order to attack the most wired/wireless society on earth.  
Growing up in Chicago helped me understand this. Working for an alderman through my 
college years, I was never once asked to do something that was legal on his behalf.   
Example:: FBI taking a hacker and having him hack, recording it, telling him he broke 
the law (although on their behalf) and now they own him: CONTROL  
They do not call someone who runs agents a control for no reason. LBJ said, trust is 
when you’ve got him by the balls.

Example: price fixing and air cargo companies: WSJ Nov 8 2010: Air France-KLM 
Face EUR150M-EUR250M Cargo Price Fixing Fine 
PARIS (Dow Jones)--Franco-Dutch airline Air France KLM (AF.FR) faces a new 
EUR150 million to EUR250 million fine Tuesday when the European Commission 
releases its verdict on an alleged air cargo cartel, French daily Les Echos Monday 
reports without citing its sources.  
Air France-KLM, which provisioned EUR530 million for the case in 2007-2008, has 
already paid EUR258.7 million in fines in the U.S., Canada and Australia for the same 
affair, Les Echos said.  
Tuesday, it could be fined another EUR150 million to EUR250 million, the newspaper 
reported, without citing sources.

Air France-KLM and several other airlines have been accused of fixing prices since 
2000, by making deals among themselves over surcharges they imposed to offset 
increases in fuel costs, and in the cost of additional anti terrorism measures, as well as 
extra war-risk insurance premiums following the outbreak of war in Iraq in 2003.  
The commission can penalize companies as much as 10% of their annual global sales if 
they find evidence of price-fixing.  
Air France-KLM denied to comment on the report Monday. "Brussels has not yet taken a 
decision," a spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires, without even confirming a 
decision is due Tuesday.  
The interpenetration of the overworld and underworld is most obvious in practices of 
money laundering and banking.  
Which enterprises are cited as being in the forefront of information security? Financial 
institutions. They are therefore identified with SECURITY. but ... if they are fostering 
conditions of radical insecurity in the world ...  then we are in the position of, for 
example, the Army counter-intelligence agent sent to Haiti in the 90s to interdict drugs, 
who found out ... he told me ... that a presidential colleague was coming down to make 
sure the route remained OPEN. [CIA agent Michel-Joseph Francois, a Haitian police 
chief, indicted for smuggling 33 tons of heroin and cocaine. “Haiti’s corrupt officials 
protected about 50 tons of cocaine/year  that transited to the US in the early 1990s.”

US Bank Money Laundering -  
Enormous By Any Measure 
By James Petras 
Professor of Sociology, Binghamton University 
There is a consensus among U.S. Congressional Investigators, former bankers and 
international banking experts that U.S. and European banks launder between $500 
billion and $1 trillion of dirty money each year, half of which is laundered by U.S. 
banks alone. As Senator Carl Levin summarizes the record: "Estimates are that 
$500 billion to $1 trillion of international criminal proceeds are moved 
internationally and deposited into bank accounts annually. It is estimated that half 
of that money comes to the United States".  
Over a decade then, between $2.5 and $5 trillion criminal proceeds have been 
laundered by U.S. banks and circulated in the U.S. financial circuits. Senator Levin's 
statement however, only covers criminal proceeds, according to U.S. laws. It does not 
include illegal transfers and capital flows from corrupt political leaders, or tax evasion by 
overseas businesses. A leading U.S. scholar who is an expert on international finance 
associated with the prestigious Brookings Institute estimates "the flow of corrupt 
money out of developing (Third World) and transitional (ex-Communist) economies 
18 
into Western coffers at $20 to $40 billion a year and the flow stemming from mis-
priced trade at $80 billion a year or more. My lowest estimate is $100 billion per year 
by these two means by which we facilitated a trillion dollars in the decade, at least half to 
the United States. Including the other elements of illegal flight capital would produce 
much higher figures. The Brookings expert also did not include illegal shifts of real estate 
and securities titles, wire fraud, etc.  
In other words, an incomplete figure of dirty money (laundered criminal and corrupt 
money) flowing into U.S. coffers during the 1990s amounted to $3-$5.5 trillion. This 
is not the complete picture but it gives us a basis to estimate the significance of the 
"dirty money factor" in evaluating the U.S. economy. In the first place, it is clear that 
the combined laundered and dirty money flows cover part of the U.S. deficit in its 
balance of merchandise trade which ranges in the hundreds of billions annually. As it 
stands, the U.S. trade deficit is close to $300 billion. Without the "dirty money" the 
U.S. economy external accounts would be totally unsustainable, living standards 
would plummet, the dollar would weaken, the available investment and loan capital 
would shrink and Washington would not be able to sustain its global empire. And 
the importance of laundered money is forecast to increase. Former private banker 
Antonio Geraldi, in testimony before the Senate Subcommittee projects significant 
growth in U.S. bank laundering. "The forecasters also predict the amounts laundered in 
the trillions of dollars and growing disproportionately to legitimate funds." The $500 
billion of criminal and dirty money flowing into and through the major U.S. banks far 
exceeds the net revenues of all the IT companies in the U.S., not to speak of their profits. 
These yearly inflows surpass all the net transfers by the major U.S. oil producers, military 
industries and airplane manufacturers. The biggest U.S. banks, particularly Citibank, 
derive a high percentage of their banking profits from serving these criminal and dirty 
money accounts. The big U.S. banks and key institutions sustain U.S. global power via 
their money laundering and managing of illegally obtained overseas funds. 
U.S. Banks and The Dirty Money Empire  
Washington and the mass media have portrayed the U.S. as being in the forefront of 
the struggle against narco trafficking, drug laundering and political corruption: the 
image is of clean white hands fighting dirty money. The truth is exactly the opposite. 
U.S. banks have developed a highly elaborate set of policies for transferring illicit 
funds to the U.S., investing those funds in legitimate businesses or U.S. government 
bonds and legitimating them. The U.S. Congress has held numerous hearings, provided 
detailed exposés of the illicit practices of the banks, passed several laws and called for 
stiffer enforcement by any number of public regulators and private bankers. Yet the 
biggest banks continue their practices, the sum of dirty money grows exponentially, 
because both the State and the banks have neither the will nor the interest to put an end to 
the practices that provide high profits and buttress an otherwise fragile empire.  
First thing to note about the money laundering business, whether criminal or 
corrupt, is that it is carried out by the most important banks in the USA. Secondly, 
19 
the practices of bank officials involved in money laundering have the backing and 
encouragement of the highest levels of the banking institutions - these are not 
isolated cases by loose cannons. This is clear in the case of Citibank's laundering of 
Raul Salinas (brother of Mexico's ex-President) $200 million account. When Salinas was 
arrested and his large scale theft of government funds was exposed, his private bank 
manager at Citibank, Amy Elliott told her colleagues that "this goes in the very, very top 
of the corporation, this was known...on the very top. We are little pawns in this whole 
thing" (p.35).  
Citibank, the biggest money launderer, is the biggest bank in the U.S., with 180,000 
employees world-wide operating in 100 countries, with $700 billion in known assets and 
over $100 billion in client assets in private bank (secret accounts) operating private 
banking offices in 30 countries, which is the largest global presence of any U.S. private 
bank. It is important to clarify what is meant by "private bank."  
Private Banking is a sector of a bank which caters to extremely wealthy clients ($1 
million deposits and up). The big banks charge customers a fee for managing their assets 
and for providing the specialized services of the private banks. Private Bank services go 
beyond the routine banking services and include investment guidance, estate planning, 
tax assistance, off-shore accounts, and complicated schemes designed to secure the 
confidentiality of financial transactions. The attractiveness of the "Private Banks" (PB) 
for money laundering is that they sell secrecy to the dirty money clients. There are two 
methods that big Banks use to launder money: via private banks and via correspondent 
banking. PB routinely use code names for accounts, concentration accounts 
(concentration accounts co-mingles bank funds with client funds which cut off paper 
trails for billions of dollars of wire transfers) that disguise the movement of client funds, 
and offshore private investment corporations (PIC) located in countries with strict 
secrecy laws (Cayman Island, Bahamas, etc.)  
For example, in the case of Raul Salinas, PB personnel at Citibank helped Salinas 
transfer $90 to $100 million out of Mexico in a manner that effectively disguised the 
funds' sources and destination thus breaking the funds' paper trail. In routine 
fashion, Citibank set up a dummy offshore corporation, provided Salinas with a 
secret code name, provided an alias for a third party intermediary who deposited 
the money in a Citibank account in Mexico and transferred the money in a 
concentration account to New York where it was then moved to Switzerland and 
London. The PICs are designed by the big banks for the purpose of holding and hiding a 
person's assets. The nominal officers, trustees and shareholder of these shell corporations 
are themselves shell corporations controlled by the PB. The PIC then becomes the holder 
of the various bank and investment accounts and the ownership of the private bank clients 
is buried in the records of so-called jurisdiction such as the Cayman Islands. Private 
bankers of the big banks like Citibank keep pre-packaged PICs on the shelf awaiting 
activation when a private bank client wants one. The system works like Russian 
Matryoshka dolls, shells within shells within shells, which in the end can be impenetrable 
to a legal process.  
20 
The complicity of the state in big bank money laundering is evident when one reviews 
the historic record. Big bank money laundering has been investigated, audited, criticized 
and subject to legislation; the banks have written procedures to comply. Yet banks like 
Citibank and the other big ten banks ignore the procedures and laws and the government 
ignores the non-compliance. {e.g. Anti-Money Laundering 
But Bank of America states in public: they have implemented an enterprise-wide Anti-
Money Laundering (AML) compliance program, which covers all of its subsidiaries and 
affiliates, and is reasonably designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  
Bank of America Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing 
Policy Statement 
Crime has a destructive and devastating effect on the communities in which we 
operate. Safeguarding the global financial system is critically important for the 
economic and national security of the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Accordingly, it is the policy of Bank of America to take all reasonable and appropriate 
steps to prevent persons engaged in money laundering, fraud, or other financial crime, 
including the financing of terrorists or terrorist operations, (hereinafter collectively 
referred to as “money laundering”) from utilizing Bank of America products and 
services. Compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the anti-money laundering 
regulatory regimes in the countries and jurisdictions in which Bank of America operates 
is one way the Bank works to achieve this policy.  
IN FACT: 
Over the last 20 years, big bank laundering of criminal funds and looted funds has 
increased geometrically, dwarfing in size and rates of profit the activities in the formal 
economy. Estimates by experts place the rate of return in the PB market between 20-25% 
annually. Congressional investigations revealed that Citibank provided "services" 
for 4 political swindlers moving $380 million: Raul Salinas - $80-$100 million, Asif 
Ali Zardari (husband of former Prime Minister of Pakistan) in excess of $40 million, 
El Hadj Omar Bongo (dictator of Gabon since 1967) in excess of $130 million, the 
Abacha sons of General Abacha ex-dictator of Nigeria - in excess of $110 million. In 
all cases Citibank violated all of its own procedures and government guidelines: 
there was no client profile (review of client background), determination of the source of 
the funds, nor of any violations of country laws from which the money accrued. On the 
contrary, the bank facilitated the outflow in its prepackaged format: shell corporations 
were established, code names were provided, funds were moved through concentration 
accounts, the funds were invested in legitimate businesses or in U.S. bonds, etc. In none 
of these cases - or thousands of others - was due diligence practiced by the banks (under 
due diligence a private bank is obligated by law to take steps to ensure that it does not 
facilitate money laundering). In none of these cases were the top banking officials 
brought to court and tried. Even after arrest of their clients, Citibank continued to provide 
services, including the movement of funds to secret accounts and the provision of loans.  
21 
Correspondent Banks: The Second Track  
The second and related route which the big banks use to launder hundreds of billions of 
dirty money is through "correspondent banking" (CB). CB is the provision of banking 
services by one bank to another bank. It is a highly profitable and significant sector of big 
banking. It enables overseas banks to conduct business and provide services for their 
customers - including drug dealers and others engaged in criminal activity - in 
jurisdictions like the U.S. where the banks have no physical presence. A bank that is 
licensed in a foreign country and has no office in the United States for its customers 
attracts and retains wealthy criminal clients interested in laundering money in the U.S. 
Instead of exposing itself to U.S. controls and incurring the high costs of locating in the 
U.S., the bank will open a correspondent account with an existing U.S. bank. By 
establishing such a relationship, the foreign bank (called a respondent) and through it, its 
criminal customers, receive many or all of the services offered by the U.S. big banks 
called the correspondent.  
Today, all the big U.S. banks have established multiple correspondent relationships 
throughout the world so they may engage in international financial transactions for 
themselves and their clients in places where they do have a physical presence. Many 
of the largest U.S. and European banks located in the financial centers of the world 
serve as correspondents for thousands of other banks. Most of the offshore banks 
laundering billions for criminal clients have accounts in the U.S. All the big banks 
specializing in international fund transfer are called money center banks, some of the 
biggest process up to $1 trillion in wire transfers a day. For the billionaire criminals an 
important feature of correspondent relationships is that they provide access to 
international transfer systems - that facilitate the rapid transfer of funds across 
international boundaries and within countries. The most recent estimates (1998) are that 
60 offshore jurisdictions around the world licensed about 4,000 offshore banks which 
control approximately $5 trillion in assets.
