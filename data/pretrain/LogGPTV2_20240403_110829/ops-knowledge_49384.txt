Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of multiple child processes in different scoreboard slots. The log begins with the initialization of child 1948 in slot 8, followed by the initialization of child 1957 in slot 8, child 1958 in slot 6, child 1959 in slot 9, child 1961 in slot 8, child 1962 in slot 6, child 1963 in slot 9, child 1964 in slot 7, child 1966 in slot 6, and child 1967 in slot 9. Along the way, there are errors related to the workerEnv in different error states.
