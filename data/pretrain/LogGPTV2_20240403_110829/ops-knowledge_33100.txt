User: What is the Git version control system? How to install and configure Git in Linux system?
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that can develop code collaboratively among multiple users, track code change history, versions, and branches, and can roll back to previous versions or merge different versions of code. The method of installing Git in the Linux system is as follows: 1. Open the terminal and use the following command to install Git: ```sudo apt-get update``` ```sudo apt-get install git``` 2. After the installation is complete, Check the Git version with the following command: ```git --version``` If the installation was successful, the version number will be displayed. 3. Configure Git, set user name and email address: ```git config --global user.name "Your Name"``` ```git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"``` This way you can start using Git for version control. Note: The above commands need to use administrator privileges. If you cannot install with normal user privileges, please add sudo.
