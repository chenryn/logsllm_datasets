User: I am writing a Python code using curses library under Linux. Are there any debugger does not share the same terminal, so I can debug alone with the code running?
EDIT:
I tried WinPDB, but it works only with python 2.7, and I am using 3.3
Assistant: IPython supports embedding a “kernel” which can then connect to an external front-end, such as a Qt one (qtconsole).
For working with another tty, I’d suggest connecting the debugger with another tty either via a pair of pipes or a pty (pseudo terminal), although you’d probably have to write the “other half” to display in the terminal, whereas the qtconsole is already ready to use as-is.
You install the Debian package ipython-qtconsole (or the Py3k version ipython3-qtconsole), then just run “ipython qtconsole” on the command line to get a GUI window containing the debugger.
Embedding is also possible: you can modify your program to call the ipython “kernel” at some point which is like setting a breakpoint.
