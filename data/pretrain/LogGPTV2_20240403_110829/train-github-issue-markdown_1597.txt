While packaging Julia 0.4.1 for Debian, we experienced a build failure on x86
caused by a timeout.
I performed a series of test builds in a Debian unstable i386 chroot, building
the latest `release-0.4` using various LLVM versions from 3.3 to 3.7. Please
inspect the complete build and test suite logs with
    git clone https://gist.github.com/d9f0ddab9658f57c762e julia-llvm-linux-x86-tests
These are the run-times of the test suite obtained with `time`:
arch | julia | llvm | elapsed  
---|---|---|---  
x86 | `eb31eef` | 3.3 | 5:59.55  
x86 | `eb31eef` | 3.4 | _segfault_  
x86 | `eb31eef` | 3.5 | _segfault_  
x86 | `eb31eef` | 3.6 | _segfault_  
x86 | `eb31eef` | 3.7 | **1:04:29**  
On x86 the Julia test suite is an **order of magnitude slower** using LLVM
3.7, compared to LLVM 3.3.
(Using LLVM 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6 the test suite aborts with a segmentation fault.)
For comparison I performed the same series of test builds in a Debian unstable
amd64 chroot on the same machine. The test suite takes longer with LLVM
versions > 3.3, but the increase is still tolerable:
arch | julia | llvm | elapsed  
---|---|---|---  
x86_64 | `eb31eef` | 3.3 | 5:22.86  
x86_64 | `eb31eef` | 3.4 | 8:41.82  
x86_64 | `eb31eef` | 3.5 | 10:01.84  
x86_64 | `eb31eef` | 3.6 | 10:11.50  
x86_64 | `eb31eef` | 3.7 | 9:56.67  
Unfortunately I cannot provide more detail regarding the x86 performance
regression, but it appears to affect all tests across the board. This issue is
blocking Julia 0.4 from entering Debian. The Julia version currently in Debian
unstable, 0.3.12, does not exhibit this issue when using LLVM â‰¥ 3.4.
I wish I had better news to report so shortly before the 0.4.2 release
(#14186).
