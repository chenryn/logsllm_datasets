##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
`include_vars`
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    $ ansible --version
    ansible 2.4.0.0
      config file = None
      configured module search path = [u'/home/vagrant/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
      ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
      executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
      python version = 2.7.5 (default, Aug  4 2017, 00:39:18) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16)]
##### CONFIGURATION
    $ ansible-config dump --only-changed
    # nothing
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Centos 7 (`Vagrantfile` below)
##### SUMMARY
`include_vars: dir` inside a role is only searching relative to the role. The
docs suggest it also searches relative to the playbook. Either it's not
searching both the owning role and the playbook directory, or the docs are
wrong.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
I've put everything into a repo; you can clone it and duplicate the problem.
`role2/tasks/main.yml`:
    - include_vars:
        dir: role1
    - debug:
        var: role1_var
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
    "role1_var": "This is from role 1"
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
A complete log is in the repo; the specific problem is below:
    "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/role2/vars/role1 directory does not exist"
