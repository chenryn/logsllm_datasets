  * Electron Version: 2.0.0
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): Windows 10
  * Last known working Electron version:
**Expected Behavior**  
I have a `` that points to a page with an `` field. When I tab
from that input field, I expect focus to wrap around back to the input field.
**Actual behavior**  
Focus goes off screen and is lost forever (I can't Tab or Shift+Tab back to
the input field like I can in a browser). I added a handler on the `document`
to see what we're focused on and verified that we're not focused on anything:
    document.addEventListener("keydown", function(e) {
        console.log(document.activeElement);
    });
After tabbing away from the input field (twice - the first tab gets me the
input field itself), that line doesn't log an element.
**To Reproduce**  
Create a test page:
In the electron-quick-start app, replace the contents of the `body` tag in
index.html with:
Focus on the `` and tab a couple times. Focus never wraps around to the
`` like it would in Chrome.
