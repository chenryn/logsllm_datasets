#### Describe the workflow you want to enable
I want to be able to use it like this:
    X_train, X_test, X_val, y_train, y_test, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, val_size=0.1)
I cannot do this:
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.1)
because the size of validation set will be 0.8 * 0.1, right?
