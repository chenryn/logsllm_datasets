10.1 Reducing Redundant Rebroadcast
We can extend our single hop ACK mechanism further to reduce
redundant rebroadcasts in multihop wireless networks by choosing
a remote neighbor for the next broadcast in a network-wide broad-
cast. We exploit the physical layer signaling to estimate the relative
distances of the neighbors, by detecting concurrent ACKs. Due to
near-far effect, the signal from the “near” node arrives before that
of the “far” node, as shown in Figure 4. This can be detected at the
physical layer using multiple overlapping FFT’s at the beginning of
signal reception. Among the set of nodes that respond we can de-
termine which ones are further away (assuming they take the same
amount of overhead time to start the ACK transmission). We can
exploit that information and select the farthest node for retrans-
mission of broadcast, thus building a reliable broadcast protocol

10.2 Parallel Polling
Concurrent communication mechanisms can be utilized in
polling nodes whether they have packets to transmit, and based on
the polling results, medium access mechanism can be ascertained.
The parallel polling mechanism can be used by the AP [21] to
query its clients about their queue length. Based on the responses,
the AP can assign variable slots to the clients for uninterrupted
transmission. This mechanism is faster than any other polling
mechanisms, which require transmission of a series of packets by
all the participating nodes to know the responses.
11. RELATED WORK
This paper presents detection of concurrent transmission as a
mechanism to acknowledge broadcast/multicast packets. Mitigat-
ing broadcast storm and making the broadcasts reliable are two
important issues that are inter-twined and addressed by many re-
searchers in different ways. To reduce redundant broadcasts, the
authors in [17] propose several schemes, namely probabilistic,
counter-based, distance-based,
location-based and cluster-based
schemes. However, there is no acknowledgment mechanism to
ensure that each of the neighbors have received the message. To
ensure reliable broadcast with permanent probabilistic failures, an
asymptotic bound for achievability of broadcast has been deduced
in [5].
Acknowledgment is an important phenomenon to report whether
a message has been successfully received by the intended re-
ceiver. The performance of various response collecting methods,
like polling, TDMA and Group Testing, have been compared in [3].
These protocols require transmission of multiple packets transmit-
ted by different nodes, which are distributed temporally. Compar-
atively, our protocol collects responses simultaneously from multi-
ple nodes within a very short period of time without transmission of
any response packets. Demirbas et al. [8] proposes Pollcast to esti-
mate the number of simultaneous responses of a polling by check-
ing the RSSI; a collision will increase the received signal strength.
A variation of similar work has been proposed in Backcast [10],
where acknowledgment is transmitted without any source address
by multiple nodes at the same time. Results show that with fewer
nodes, the ACK is decodable and received signal strength approx-
imately indicates the number of concurrent transmissions. Both
Pollcast and Backcast are incapable of detecting the exact neighbor
who has transmitted the response. We move a step forward from
these mechanisms and not only correctly detect the number of con-
current transmissions, but also detect the exact neighbors which has
participated in transmitting the acknowledgment.
The increasing popularity of OFDM in current wireless tech-
nologies has convinced us to choose it as the underlying mecha-
nism of communication.
It has been embraced by current wire-

less technologies in IEEE 802.11 WLAN [13] and WiMax [14]. It
is also one of the physical layer communication system in IEEE
802.22 WRAN [12]. Simultaneous transmission of tones or sim-
ply each node transmitting in a single subcarrier, has the same or-
thogonal property, but requires less complexity at the receiver to
detect. OFDM/OFDMA utilizes the bandwidth by transmitting in
a set of subcarriers, which requires pilot tones inserted at regular
intervals in frequency domain to capture the channel coefﬁcients
and aid equalization [7]. To decode a packet transmitted over a set
of subcarriers, it is necessary to equalize the received signal with
the help of information received from the pilot tones. Our mecha-
nism uses simple energy detection scheme at the receiver without
the hassle of equalization and baseband decoding.
OFDMA has also been introduced in cellular network as a si-
multaneous communication mechanism, where subcarrier assign-
ment [26, 15] considers a set of contiguous subcarriers. Non-
contiguous OFDM [19] has mostly been popular in the cognitive
radio domain, where a transmitter does not have access to a con-
tiguous set of subcarriers for transmission due to presence of pri-
mary users. In this scenario, timing synchronization [2] and de-
coding the signal is a challenge. Although in our case, the signal
generated from multiple nodes is a non-contiguous OFDM signal,
our protocol only requires energy detection in each of the subcar-
riers and hence do not encounter the challenges of non-contiguous
OFDM communication.
Simultaneous transmissions can also be detected by the multi-
user detection scheme in CDMA. To detect CDMA codes trans-
mitted by the clients, the receiver has to perform correlation for
all the N clients/codes. The post processing of the signal is time
consuming if an elimination process is used, or extremely resource
consuming if N parallel correlators are used. To avoid complexity
of the problem, researchers [23] use various heuristic methods to
obtain a suboptimal solution.
Instances of using simultaneous tone transmissions on OFDM
subcarriers for higher layer applications are rare. Energy detection
of subcarriers has been utilized by Roman et al. [20] in a leader
election protocol to eliminate contenders for channel access mech-
anism. Here, authors use only 8 subcarriers to indicate whether it
is contending for the wireless medium. After a few number of con-
tending slots, a winner is decided which gets access to the medium.
However we demonstrate the use of the signaling mechanism to
address a broader array of network problems. We also address the
challenges and scope of implementing such a protocol using recon-
ﬁgurable hardware, which is the novelty of this work.
Spectrum sensing also forms an integral part in the evolution
of cognitive radio based research. Although there are various ap-
proaches to ﬁnd spectrum holes, as given in [4], we still ﬁnd that
the basic operation is a set of threshold tests that ultimately differ-
entiates the good signals from the bad. Although SNR Wall [24]
remains a problem for simple detection mechanism in cognitive do-
main, our protocol does not suffer from this effect. In cognitive ra-

dios, the secondary user should be able to robustly detect the pres-
ence of a primary user in the vicinity even from hidden positions
where the primary user’s signal goes below the ‘SNR Wall’ and is
difﬁcult to be detected by a simple threshold test. In our protocol,
the tones are transmitted by clients of an AP, who are all one-hop
neighbors. The signal from those clients are high enough that even
packets transmitted by the clients can be decoded at the AP. So, the
signal energy is not as low as we notice in cognitive radio domain
and a simple threshold test, as we suggest, can be used to detect the
tones.
Prior works in a similar domain powered by simple imple-
mentable algorithms has led us to explore beyond the boundaries of
preset methods and innovate new protocols in the domain of wire-
less networks.
2512. CONCLUSION
We’ve shown that by using, rather than ﬁghting against, the prop-
erties of the wireless physical media, we can develop robust sig-
naling primitives that are both practical and allow innovative algo-
rithms. We used a signaling method based on OFDM that is easy
to understand and implement using reconﬁgurable hardware. We
have also shown that if the signaling mechanism is kept simple,
not only does it makes certain network functions, such as reliable
broadcasts faster, but can also use simple detection mechanism to
extract the required information. These primitives can also be used
to implement higher level group communication and signaling pro-
tocols as long as the queries require simple “yes/no” answers. The
critical insight is that we can combine the results from multiple
clients using simultaneous reception in an efﬁcient manner to aid
higher protocols to perform more efﬁciently.
