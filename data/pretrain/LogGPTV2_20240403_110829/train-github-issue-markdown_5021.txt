### Summary of MKL-Related Test Failures for the Current Release Candidate

In this release candidate, we encountered a set of failures related to the use of Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) in our testing. I am currently using the following environment:

- **Intel C Compiler (ICC) Version**: `icc (ICC) 16.0.1 20151021`
- **NumPy Version**: `1.10.0.dev0+075cc98` (from the `maintenance/1.10.x` branch)
- **SciPy Version**: `0.17.0rc1`
- **Python Version**: `2.7.10`
- **nose Version**: `1.3.6`

The full test suite for NumPy (`numpy.test('full')`) passes without issues. However, running the full test suite for SciPy (`scipy.test('full')`) results in the following failures:

#### Test Failures
1. **Test: `test_lorentz` (in `test_odr.TestODR`)**
   - **Error Message**:
     ```python
     AssertionError: 
     Arrays are not almost equal to 6 decimals
     (mismatch 100.0%)
      x: array([  1.000000e+03,   1.000000e-01,   3.800000e+00])
      y: array([  1.430678e+03,   1.339051e-01,   3.779819e+00])
     ```

2. **Test: `test_multi` (in `test_odr.TestODR`)**
   - **Error Message**:
     ```python
     AssertionError: 
     Arrays are not almost equal to 6 decimals
     (mismatch 100.0%)
      x: array([ 4. ,  2. ,  7. ,  0.4,  0.5])
      y: array([ 4.379988,  2.433306,  8.002885,  0.510115,  0.51739 ])
     ```

3. **Test: `test_pearson` (in `test_odr.TestODR`)**
   - **Error Message**:
     ```python
     AssertionError: 
     Arrays are not almost equal to 6 decimals
     (mismatch 100.0%)
      x: array([ 1.,  1.])
      y: array([ 5.47674 , -0.479608])
     ```

#### Additional Information
- **Total Tests Run**: 21,565
- **Total Time**: 1,190.894 seconds
- **Test Results**: 
  - **Failures**: 3
  - **Known Failures**: 130
  - **Skipped Tests**: 1,811

### Next Steps
- **Clarification on MKL Usage**: Do other team members also test with MKL? If not, should I make it a habit to include MKL in the pre-release testing?
- **Resolution of `1.10` Failures**: Before proceeding, it would be beneficial to resolve the failures in the `1.10` version to ensure that all tests pass before moving on to the latest `numpy` master.

Please let me know if there are any additional steps or considerations needed to address these issues.
