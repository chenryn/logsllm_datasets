**User:**
I am using Eclipse, Python 2.7, wxPython 2.8, and macOS 10.5.8. I would like to ensure that wxPython is correctly integrated into my Eclipse environment so that all wxPython commands are recognized and not underlined as errors.

I have added the correct path of the wxPython library to the PYTHONPATH via Eclipse preferences. When I manually import the path in Eclipse, save the settings, and then everything works as expected. However, if I close and reopen Eclipse, even though the interpreter has its own path to wxPython, it seems to be unrecognized, and I lose autocompletion and documentation. I need to remove and re-add the same path every time to make everything work. This issue has persisted for months, and I suspect it might be related to macOS and Eclipse. Do you know why this is happening? 

Do you agree with my suspicion?

**Assistant:**

Thank you for your detailed description. It sounds like there might be an issue with how Eclipse is persisting the PYTHONPATH settings across sessions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to help resolve the problem:

1. **Configure the Interpreter in PyDev:**
   - Go to `Preferences` > `PyDev` > `Interpreter - Python`.
   - Add a new interpreter by clicking `New...`, and select the appropriate Python 2.7 interpreter.
   - Click `Apply` and wait for PyDev to parse the interpreter's environment. This process can take a while, so please be patient.
   - Once the parsing is complete, click `OK`.

2. **Set the Correct Interpreter for Your Project:**
   - Right-click on your project in the Eclipse Project Explorer.
   - Select `Properties` > `PyDev - Interpreter/Grammar`.
   - Ensure that the newly set-up interpreter (the one with the correct PYTHONPATH) is selected.
   - Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

3. **Verify the PYTHONPATH:**
   - In the `Preferences` > `PyDev` > `Interpreter - Python`, select the interpreter you just configured.
   - Go to the `Forced Builtins` tab and ensure that `wx` or `wxPython` is listed. If not, add it.
   - Also, check the `Environment` tab to see if the `PYTHONPATH` includes the path to the wxPython library. If not, add it.

4. **Check for macOS-Specific Issues:**
   - Sometimes, macOS-specific issues can cause configuration persistence problems. Make sure that your Eclipse workspace is not located in a directory that requires elevated permissions.
   - You might also want to check if there are any known issues or updates for the version of Eclipse and PyDev you are using. Updating to the latest versions might resolve some of these issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to ensure that the wxPython library is correctly recognized and that the settings persist across Eclipse sessions. If the problem persists, it might be worth checking if there are any specific logs or error messages that could provide more insight into what is going wrong.
