I have been using the fill_between function before and recently I have started
receiving an `IndexError: too many indices for array: array is 0-dimensional,
but 1 were indexed` . I also tried some examples using the fill_between
function in your documentation
(https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/fill_between_alpha.html#sphx-
glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-fill-between-alpha-py) and was receiving
the same error each time. I am currently using matplotlib version 3.5.1 and
python version 3.10.6
