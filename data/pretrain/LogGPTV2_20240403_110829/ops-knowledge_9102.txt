User: I have an app that services inbound mail and I have deployed a new development version to Google App Engine. The default is currently set to the previous version.
Is there a way to specify that inbound mail should be delivered to a particular version?
This is well documented using URLs but I can't find any reference to version support in the inbound mail service...
Assistant: No, this isn't currently supported. You could write some code for your default version that routes mail to other versions via URLFetch, though.
