## Route Maps
* For redist, routes from current routing table
## Redistribution
* OSPF default cost 20 from IGP, 1 from BGP
* ISIS - 0, default type of l1
## Summarization
* Eigrp - ip summary-address eigrp ASN 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 DISTANCE - int, or done in af-interface, plus setting summary-metric within topology base
* OSPF - summary-address for ASBR, area 1 range for ABR, area is where component subnets area, not where to advertise
## Default routes
* Redistribution
* Static route to 0.0.0.0 with redist static - EIGRP and RIP
* default-information-originate - RIP, OSPF
 * OSPF - any defaults in routing table, default cost 1, E2
 * RIP creates and advertises if no default exists or from another protocol
  * If static, no injection as done with redist
* ip default-network - RIP,EIGRP
 * EIGRP - must be advertised by local router into EIGRP, flagged as candidate
 * RIP - no flag, no need to be advertised
* summary routes - EIGRP
 * Creates null route on local
## Performance Routing
* Interfaces
 * Internal - Connects to internal network, commes with PfR master controller
 * External - packets out network, needs at least two
 * Local - forms control plane, defines source to communicate to PfR MC
* Auth - not optional, key chain auth
* MC - Talks to and auths BRs, monitors flows, applies policies, single MC supports 10 BRs or 20 exit ints
 * Can run MC and BR on same device, still needs auth
