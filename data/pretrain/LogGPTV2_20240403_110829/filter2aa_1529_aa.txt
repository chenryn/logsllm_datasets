How I Got Here
How I Got Here
Contagion
Exposure to suicide or suicidal behavior directly or 
indirectly (via media) influences others to attempt 
suicide.
We’re Doing it Wrong
Responsible Journalism & Social Media Standards
What We Should Say
How We Should Say It
"Committed"
Instead, use "completed" or "died by"
Suicide is never the result of a single 
factor or event
Suicide is the result of extremely 
complex interactions between 
psychological, social, and medical 
problems
Suicide results, most often, from a long 
history of problems
Don't present suicide as a means to a certain end, a 
valid coping mechanism, or an understandable 
solution to a specific problem
Don't make venerating statements out of context 
(e.g. "She was a great kid with a bright future.") 
Do temper coverage of displays of grief
Do promote coping strategies and post links to 
prevention resources

Where Do We Seek Help?
Online Crisis Response
30% of callers to suicide hotlines hang up
Online response networks are more 
"anonymous" for both caller & volunteer
Efficacy appears to be equivalent, though data 
analysis is more difficult online
IMAlive has very consistent training
Volunteer pairing has the same "luck of the 
draw" as via phone
Crisis Intervention is Easy
Supporting a depressed friend is hard.
Intervention Hotline
Frientervention
●
Burden of initiation on PIC*
●
PIC assumes you are qualified, 
+1 to credibility
●
Interactions has finite bounds
Hotline volunteers must remain 
anonymous
Therapists can set their hours of 
availability
*PIC = Person In Crisis
●
You may need to initiate
●
Friend sees you as a peer
●
Friends may have an expectation of 
"always on" access
●
Lack of improvement in their situation 
may degrade your credibility over time
Emotional exhaustion
● Let’s keep encouraging people to open up and 
seek help
BUT ALSO
● Let’s start proactively screening and responding 
to potential threats
Rethink our Service Model
● Direct Verbal Clues
● Indirect Verbal Clues
● Behavioral Clues
● Situational Clues
Identifying Risk
Take all red flags seriously, confront them 
immediately.
● Myth: If someone is talking about suicide, 
they won’t do it.
● Myth: Talking to someone about suicide 
might put the idea in their head.
