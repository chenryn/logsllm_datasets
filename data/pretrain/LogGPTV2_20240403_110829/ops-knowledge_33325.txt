User: I want to use h5py which needs libhdf5-dev to be installed. I installed hdf5 from the source, and thought that any options with compiling that one would offer me the developer headers, but doesn't look like it.
Anyone know how I can do this? Is there some other source i need to download? (I cant find any though)
I am on amazon linux, yum search libhdf5-dev doesn't give me any result and I cant use rpm nor apt-get there, hence I wanted to compile it myself.
Assistant: For Centos 8, I got the below warning message :

Warning: Couldn't find any HDF5 C++ libraries. Disabling HDF5 support.

and I solved it using the command :

sudo yum -y install hdf5-devel
