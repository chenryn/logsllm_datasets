It sounds like you are trying to use `h5py` on an Amazon Linux system, and you need the `libhdf5-dev` package for the necessary developer headers. You have already installed HDF5 from the source, but it seems that the installation did not include the required development files.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:

1. **Install HDF5 Development Files:**
   - Since you are using Amazon Linux, you can try installing the `hdf5-devel` package, which should provide the necessary development headers.
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     sudo yum -y install hdf5-devel
     ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - After installing `hdf5-devel`, verify that the headers are available. The headers should be located in `/usr/include/hdf5/` or a similar directory.
   - You can check if the headers are present by running:
     ```sh
     ls /usr/include/hdf5/
     ```

3. **Reinstall `h5py`:**
   - Once the development headers are in place, you can reinstall `h5py` to ensure it picks up the correct paths.
   - Use the following command to install `h5py`:
     ```sh
     pip install h5py
     ```

4. **Alternative: Compile HDF5 with Developer Headers:**
   - If the `hdf5-devel` package is not available or does not work, you can compile HDF5 from the source with the developer headers.
   - Download the HDF5 source code from the official website: [HDF5 Downloads](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/)
   - Extract the downloaded file and navigate to the extracted directory.
   - Configure and build HDF5 with the following commands:
     ```sh
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx --enable-hl
     make
     sudo make install
     ```
   - This will install HDF5 and its development files to `/usr/local`.

5. **Set Environment Variables (if needed):**
   - If `h5py` still cannot find the HDF5 libraries, you may need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` environment variables.
   - Add the following lines to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`):
     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
     ```
   - Reload the profile:
     ```sh
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

6. **Reinstall `h5py` Again:**
   - Finally, reinstall `h5py` to ensure it uses the newly compiled HDF5 libraries:
     ```sh
     pip install h5py
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to install `h5py` with the necessary HDF5 development headers on your Amazon Linux system.
