We are currently using Celery to make third-party HTTP calls. Our system involves over 100 tasks, each of which is responsible for calling a third-party API. Some of these tasks involve bulk requests, such as half a million requests at 4 AM, while others handle a continuous stream of API calls, receiving requests approximately once or twice per second. The typical response time for these API calls ranges from 500 to 800 milliseconds.

However, we are experiencing very slow delivery rates with Celery. For most tasks, the maximum delivery rate is around 100 requests per second (max) and can be as low as 1 request per second (min). We believe this performance is suboptimal and suspect that there may be an underlying issue, but we have not been able to identify it.

Initially, we started with a cluster of three servers, which we incrementally expanded to seven servers, but this did not result in any significant performance improvement. We have experimented with different concurrency settings, including autoscaling and fixed worker counts of 10, 20, 50, and 100. We do not use a result backend, and our broker is RabbitMQ. Given that our task execution time is typically less than a second, we have also tried setting the prefetch count to various values, including unlimited.

Our current Celery configuration includes:
- `--time-limit=1800`
- `--maxtasksperchild=1000`
- `-Ofair`
- `-c 64`
- `--config=celeryconfig_production`

The servers are equipped with 64 GB of RAM and run on CentOS 6.6.

Could you provide some insights into what might be causing the poor performance, or suggest steps to resolve the issue? 

Should we consider using gevent, even though I am not very familiar with it?

### Analysis and Recommendations

**1. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):**
   - The GIL should not be a significant issue here, as adding more machines should theoretically improve performance. However, ensure that the load is distributed across all CPU cores. You can check this by monitoring CPU usage on each server.

**2. Celery Configuration:**
   - **Concurrency Settings:** Your current concurrency settings (`-c 64`) and other parameters seem reasonable, but they may need further tuning. Consider experimenting with different values, especially if the number of workers exceeds the number of available CPU cores.
   - **Prefetch Count:** Setting the prefetch count to unlimited or a high value can help, but it can also lead to memory issues. Ensure that your system has enough memory to handle the increased load.
   - **Broker Configuration:** Make sure that RabbitMQ is properly configured and not a bottleneck. Check the RabbitMQ logs and monitor its performance metrics.

**3. Network and I/O:**
   - **Network Latency:** Given the response time of 500-800 ms, network latency could be a significant factor. Ensure that your network infrastructure is optimized and that there are no bottlenecks.
   - **I/O Bound Tasks:** Since your tasks are I/O bound (HTTP requests), consider using asynchronous I/O to improve performance. This is where gevent can be beneficial.

**4. Alternative Solutions:**
   - **gevent:** Gevent is a coroutine-based Python networking library that uses greenlets to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of the libev or libuv event loop. It can be a good fit for I/O-bound tasks like HTTP requests. However, integrating gevent with Celery requires some setup. You can use `celery[gevent]` to leverage gevent within Celery.
   - **Other Clients:** If Celery continues to be a bottleneck, consider writing a proof of concept (PoC) using a simpler client library like `pika` for RabbitMQ. This can help determine if the issue is with Celery or the broader infrastructure.

**5. Testing and Monitoring:**
   - **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to simulate the load and measure performance. Use multiple machines to test the full TCP stack and ensure that the tests are representative of your production environment.
   - **Continuous Integration (CI):** Set up CI to run these tests regularly and monitor the results to ensure that performance improvements are sustained.

**6. Infrastructure:**
   - **Server Resources:** Ensure that your servers have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth) to handle the load. Monitor resource usage and adjust as necessary.
   - **Operating System:** Consider upgrading from CentOS 6.6 to a more recent version, as older versions may have performance and security limitations.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and address the performance issues in your Celery setup.
