Question: An adversary is attempting to use an optical character recognition (OCR) algorithm to bypass a CAPTCHA system that presents distorted letters and words. Which of the following statements provide plausible explanations for why this strategy may not be successful?
"A": "The CAPTCHA system includes background noise and distortion that confuse the OCR algorithm, making character recognition unreliable.",
"B": "The OCR algorithm can easily interpret distorted characters as it is designed specifically to handle various font styles and sizes.",
"C": "CAPTCHAs with low contrast and merged-together letters may impede the OCR's ability to distinguish between individual characters.",
"D": "OCR algorithms are highly advanced and can interpret any text image regardless of distortion, rendering the CAPTCHA system ineffective."
Answer: AC
