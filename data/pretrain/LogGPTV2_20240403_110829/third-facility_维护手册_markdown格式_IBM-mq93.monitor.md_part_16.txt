### Connections and Accounting Messages

Connections to a queue manager are grouped by queue. Each queue accounting message can contain up to 100 records, with each record detailing an activity performed by the application concerning a specific queue.

Accounting messages are recorded only for local queues. If an application makes an MQI call against an alias queue, the accounting data is recorded against the base queue. For a remote queue, the accounting data is recorded against the transmission queue.

**Note:** The information in these accounting messages pertains to MQI operations performed by IBM MQ applications. Operations related to streaming queues are not included unless the operation directly involves that queue by the application.

### Accounting Message Format

Accounting messages consist of a set of PCF fields, including a message descriptor and message data.

#### Message Descriptor
- **MQMD (Message Descriptor)**: An accounting message MQMD.

#### Message Data
- **MQCFH (PCF Header)**: Contains information about the application and the interval for which the accounting data was recorded.
- **Accounting Message Data**: Comprises PCF parameters that store the accounting information. The content of accounting messages depends on the message category as follows:

  - **MQI Accounting Message**: Consists of multiple PCF parameters but no PCF groups.
  - **Queue Accounting Message**: Consists of multiple PCF parameters and between 1 and 100 QAccountingData PCF groups. Each QAccountingData PCF group corresponds to a queue with collected accounting data. If an application accesses more than 100 queues, multiple accounting messages are generated. Each message has the `SeqNumber` in the MQCFH (PCF header) updated accordingly, and the last message in the sequence has the `Control` parameter in the MQCFH specified as `MQCFC_LAST`.

### Controlling the Collection of Accounting Information

Use queue and queue manager attributes to control the collection of accounting information. You can also use MQCONNX options to control collection at the connection level.

#### Controlling MQI Accounting Information
- **ACCTMQI Attribute**: Use the queue manager attribute `ACCTMQI` to control the collection of MQI accounting information.
  - **ON**: Collects MQI accounting information for every connection to the queue manager.
  - **OFF**: Does not collect MQI accounting information. This is the default value.
  - **Example**: To enable MQI accounting information collection, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QMGR ACCTMQI(ON)
    ```

#### Queue Accounting Information
- **ACCTQ Attribute**: Use the queue attribute `ACCTQ` and the queue manager attribute `ACCTQ` to control the collection of queue accounting information.
  - **ON**: Collects queue accounting information for this queue for every connection to the queue manager that opens the queue.
  - **OFF**: Does not collect queue accounting information for this queue.
  - **QMGR**: Controls the collection of queue accounting information for this queue according to the value of the queue manager attribute `ACCTQ`. This is the default value.
  - **Example**: To enable accounting information collection for the queue `Q1`, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QLOCAL(Q1) ACCTQ(ON)
    ```
  - **Example**: To enable accounting information collection for all queues that specify the queue attribute `ACCTQ` as `QMGR`, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QMGR ACCTQ(ON)
    ```

#### MQCONNX Options for Controlling Accounting Information Collection
- **ConnectOpts Parameter**: Use the `ConnectOpts` parameter on the `MQCONNX` call to modify the collection of both MQI and queue accounting information at the connection level by overriding the effective values of the queue manager attributes `ACCTMQI` and `ACCTQ`.
  - **MQCNO_ACCOUNTING_MQI_ENABLED**: Enables MQI accounting for this connection if the queue manager attribute `ACCTMQI` is `OFF`.
  - **MQCNO_ACCOUNTING_MQI_DISABLED**: Disables MQI accounting for this connection if the queue manager attribute `ACCTMQI` is `ON`.
  - **MQCNO_ACCOUNTING_Q_ENABLED**: Enables queue accounting for this connection if the queue manager attribute `ACCTQ` is `OFF`.
  - **MQCNO_ACCOUNTING_Q_DISABLED**: Disables queue accounting for this connection if the queue manager attribute `ACCTQ` is `ON`.
  - **Example**: To enable accounting overrides for individual connections, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QMGR ACCTCONO(ENABLED)
    ```

### Accounting Message Generation When Applications Disconnect

Accounting messages are generated when an application disconnects from the queue manager. Intermediate accounting messages are also written for long-running IBM MQ applications.

- **MQDISC Call**: The application issues an `MQDISC` call.
- **Application Termination**: The queue manager recognizes that the application has terminated.
- **Intermediate Accounting Messages**: Written for long-running IBM MQ applications when the interval since the connection was established or since the last intermediate accounting message exceeds the configured interval. The queue manager attribute `ACCTINT` specifies the time, in seconds, after which intermediate accounting messages can be automatically written. The default accounting interval is 1800 seconds (30 minutes). For example, to change the accounting interval to 900 seconds (15 minutes), use the following MQSC command:
  ```sh
  ALTER QMGR ACCTINT(900)
  ```

### Statistics Messages

Statistics messages record information about activities occurring in an IBM MQ system. These messages are PCF messages containing multiple PCF structures.

#### Categories of Statistics Messages
- **MQI Statistics Messages**: Contain information about the number of MQI calls made during a configured interval.
- **Queue Statistics Messages**: Contain information about the activity of a queue during a configured interval, such as the number of messages put on and retrieved from the queue, and the total number of bytes processed by the queue.
- **Channel Statistics Messages**: Contain information about the activity of a channel during a configured interval, such as the number of messages and bytes transferred by the channel.

Each statistics message can contain up to 100 records, with each record relating to the activity per queue or channel for which statistics were collected. Statistics messages are recorded only for local queues. If an application makes an MQI call against an alias queue, the statistics data is recorded against the base queue, and for a remote queue, the statistics data is recorded against the transmission queue.

#### Controlling Statistics Information Collection
- **STATMQI Attribute**: Use the queue manager attribute `STATMQI` to control the collection of MQI statistics information.
  - **ON**: Collects MQI statistics information for every connection to the queue manager.
  - **OFF**: Does not collect MQI statistics information. This is the default value.
  - **Example**: To enable MQI statistics information collection, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QMGR STATMQI(ON)
    ```

- **STATQ Attribute**: Use the queue attribute `STATQ` and the queue manager attribute `STATQ` to control the collection of queue statistics information.
  - **ON**: Collects queue statistics information for every connection to the queue manager that opens the queue.
  - **OFF**: Does not collect queue statistics information for this queue.
  - **QMGR**: Controls the collection of queue statistics information for this queue according to the value of the queue manager attribute `STATQ`. This is the default value.
  - **Example**: To enable statistics information collection for the queue `Q1`, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QLOCAL(Q1) STATQ(ON)
    ```
  - **Example**: To enable statistics information collection for all queues that specify the queue attribute `STATQ` as `QMGR`, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QMGR STATQ(ON)
    ```

- **STATCHL Attribute**: Use the channel attribute `STATCHL` to control the collection of channel statistics information.
  - **LOW**: Collects channel statistics information with a low level of detail.
  - **MEDIUM**: Collects channel statistics information with a medium level of detail.
  - **HIGH**: Collects channel statistics information with a high level of detail.
  - **OFF**: Does not collect channel statistics information for this channel.
  - **QMGR**: The channel attribute is set as `QMGR`. The collection of statistics information for this channel is controlled by the value of the queue manager attribute `STATCHL`. This is the default value.
  - **Example**: To enable statistics information collection with a medium level of detail for the sender channel `QM1.TO.QM2`, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER CHANNEL(QM1.TO.QM2) CHLTYPE(SDR) STATCHL(MEDIUM)
    ```

- **STATACLS Attribute**: Use the queue manager attribute `STATACLS` to control the collection of statistics information for automatically defined cluster-sender channels.
  - **LOW**: Collects statistics information with a low level of detail.
  - **MEDIUM**: Collects statistics information with a medium level of detail.
  - **HIGH**: Collects statistics information with a high level of detail.
  - **OFF**: Does not collect statistics information for automatically defined cluster-sender channels.
  - **QMGR**: The collection of statistics information for automatically defined cluster-sender channels is controlled by the value of the queue manager attribute `STATCHL`. This is the default value.
  - **Example**: To enable statistics information collection with a medium level of detail for all channels that specify the channel attribute `STATCHL` as `QMGR`, use the following MQSC command:
    ```sh
    ALTER QMGR STATCHL(MEDIUM)
    ```
