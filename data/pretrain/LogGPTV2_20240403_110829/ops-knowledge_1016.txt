User: I installed eclipse with pydev plugin. I need to run my existing project on eclipse. But there are relative paths to the files inside my code. I expect from eclipse to append relative paths to the project's default directory. Instead, it appends the relative path to the directory where Eclipse is installed. I could not find a way to solve the problem.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: I finally found out how to do it and I am writing the answer for other people with the same problem. You can find it in Run Configurations or Debug Configurations. Choose "Python Run" and your run configuration from the left and then in the "Arguments" tab in the right side, set your "working directory" as "other" with giving "the path" on which you want to run your code. Thanks for your interest, Wayne btw.
