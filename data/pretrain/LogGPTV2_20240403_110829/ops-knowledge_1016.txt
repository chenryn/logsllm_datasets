I recently installed Eclipse with the PyDev plugin and needed to run an existing project. However, my code contains relative paths to files, and I expected Eclipse to append these relative paths to the project's default directory. Instead, it appends them to the directory where Eclipse is installed. After some investigation, I found a solution to this issue.

To resolve this, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Run Configurations** or **Debug Configurations**.
2. Select **Python Run** and choose your specific run configuration from the list on the left.
3. Navigate to the **Arguments** tab on the right side.
4. In the **Working Directory** section, select **Other**.
5. Enter the path to the directory where you want to run your code.

This will ensure that the relative paths in your code are correctly resolved relative to the specified working directory.

Thank you for your interest, Wayne.
