Question: Given the benefits of ORM tools in web application development, which of the following reasons would make an application using ORM generated objects still vulnerable to ORM Injection attacks?
"A": "ORM tools can generate overly complex code that is difficult to understand and maintain, leading to security oversights.",
"B": "The use of ORM generated objects inherently slows down application performance, which can lead to timeouts and potential exploitation.",
"C": "Web applications might accept unsanitized input parameters that the ORM methods can process, leading to injection vulnerabilities.",
"D": "ORM layers completely abstract the database layer, making it impossible for attackers to direct SQL queries to the database."
Answer: C
