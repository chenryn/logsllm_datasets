Question: "On Macs with Apple silicon, Rosetta 2 enables the execution of x86_64 code. There are two types of translation processes: Just-in-time (JIT) and Ahead-of-time (AOT). Considering system security, what are the potential advantages and disadvantages associated with each type?"
 "A": "JIT translation might introduce a security risk due to runtime code generation, which could be exploited if the code hash verification mechanism fails"
 "B": "AOT translation reduces the attack surface by limiting the time-accessible storage of translated artefacts and managing access through the Rosetta service"
 "C": "JIT translation ensures that all translated code is stored in persistent storage, thereby increasing the likelihood of tampering"
 "D": "AOT translation can potentially lead to information leakage since the translated artefacts are stored without any form of encryption"
Answer: AB
