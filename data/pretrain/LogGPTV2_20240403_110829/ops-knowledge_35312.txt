User: I am investigating a switch from windows to linux and i struggle to find samples of design patterns applied in this world.
The application is a classic client server with detailed forms for each business entity.
It will be taking user input, do some validation checks, a few calculations, and save them to database.
It will also have lists summarizing entities, and searches among these entities.
A click to one item of these lists will open the detailled forms.
If i use python or ruby, what should i use for GUI ?
And what pattern : is MVC, MVVM or MVP any good ?
Or is there anything better ?  
Note : I have never done web developpement, and i would like to avoid to have to learn both linux and web developpement at the same time.
Assistant: The two main UI toolkits in Linux these days are Qt and GTK+. Qt is widely used by the KDE desktop, while GTK+ is widely used by Gnome. But a Qt app will run in Gnome and vise-versa. Both toolkits have bindings to a massive amount of languages.
