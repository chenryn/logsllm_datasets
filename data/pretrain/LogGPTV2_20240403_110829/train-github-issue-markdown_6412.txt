I have a service, which is a class that internally uses Http:
    @Injectable()
    export class ProductService{
        constructor( private http: Http){}
        getProductByID(productID: string): Observable{
           return this.http.get(`/products/${productID}`)
               .map(res => res.json());
        }
    }
To use this service, an external component must specify [HTTP_PROVIDERS]. This
breaks encapsulation of my ProductService (a.k.a. Leaky Abstraction): now it's
not a reusable black box but has strings attached. If I decide to replace Http
with another service in the above code, the external component must modify its
code as well. It would be nice if there was a way to allow a class (not a
component) to specify its own providers.
Am I asking for too much? :)
