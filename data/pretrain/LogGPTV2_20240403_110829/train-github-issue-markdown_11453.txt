### Current Behavior
The elements are currently separated.

### Expected Behavior
The elements should be combined into a single entity.

### Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions
Please provide a minimal, reproducible example and clear instructions to replicate the issue.

### Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior
The current separation of these elements has caused confusion among my colleagues when referencing them. It is also inconsistent and awkward to manage the same element (e.g., a form) in different parts of the same core.
