Please refer to the following link for more details: [Bootstrap JavaScript - Tooltips](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips).

I have encountered an issue with the `data-placement` attribute. Despite setting it, the tooltips consistently appear at the top, rather than in the specified position. 

Could you please provide some guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this?
