## Abstract
This paper introduces the design and implementation of "Wi-Fi Goes to Town," a pioneering Wi-Fi-based roadside hotspot network designed to operate at vehicular speeds with meter-sized picocells. The system leverages path diversity in roadside networks by making delivery decisions to vehicular clients at millisecond-level granularities. To achieve this, we introduce new buffer management algorithms that allow participating Access Points (APs) to manage each other's queues, rapidly quenching transmissions and flushing queues. We integrate our fine-grained AP selection and queue management into 802.11’s frame aggregation and block acknowledgment functions, ensuring high spectral efficiency at modern 802.11 bit rates. We have implemented and tested our system in an eight-AP network alongside a nearby road, achieving a 2.4–4.7× TCP throughput improvement over state-of-the-art fast handover protocols, including IEEE 802.11k and 802.11r.

## 1. Introduction
Every day, billions of commuters travel to and from urban centers, often using trains, light rail, or vehicles that may soon become autonomous. This commute time is often unproductive, but there is a growing demand for high-capacity wireless networks to serve transportation corridors, enabling users to stay connected during their journeys. 

Surprisingly, the majority of capacity gains in cellular wireless networks over the past 45 years can be attributed to reducing cell sizes rather than new technologies. However, smaller cells create a tension between capacity and range, necessitating frequent handovers as clients move between APs.

Recent standards like 802.11r and 802.11k aim to improve roaming, but they are too slow for high-speed vehicular environments. Two emerging trends offer a solution:
1. Commodity Wi-Fi APs can now extract detailed channel measurements, allowing rapid prediction of the best AP for a moving client.
2. Low-cost Wi-Fi chipsets, such as the ESP8266, make high-density AP installations feasible.

In this work, we leverage these trends to design a system that efficiently operates in the vehicular picocell regime, where the best AP for a client changes every millisecond due to rapid fading and multipath propagation.

## 2. Wi-Fi Roaming at Driving Speed
Current commercial Wi-Fi APs, such as those supporting 802.11r, are optimized for walking speed and large cells. We evaluated Linksys 802.11r-based APs in an outdoor roadside testbed. At 20 mph, the handover fails because the client spends less time within range of the current AP than the 5-second RSSI measurement period required by 802.11r. At 5 mph, the handover succeeds but is delayed, leading to reduced throughput.

## 3. Design
### 3.1 Downlink Packet Flow
For each downlink packet, Wi-Fi Goes to Town (WGTT) selects the best AP to deliver the packet and manages packet queues to ensure timely delivery. Our AP selection algorithm uses Effective SNR (ESNR), computed from channel state information (CSI) extracted from uplink transmissions. ESNR accounts for SNR variations across subcarriers, providing more accurate predictions in frequency-selective channels.

### 3.2 Uplink Data Delivery
Uplink packets can be received by any AP, but the controller removes duplicates. WGTT integrates this with 802.11’s frame aggregation and block acknowledgment mechanisms to maintain high performance.

## 4. Implementation
We implemented WGTT on commodity TP-Link APs, each equipped with a parabolic antenna. The Atheros CSI Tool measures CSI and forwards it to a Linux controller running Click. For comparison, we also implemented a performance-tuned version of 802.11r and 802.11k in Click.

## 5. Experimental Evaluation
We deployed eight WGTT APs on the third floor of an office building overlooking a nearby road. Experiments compared WGTT with the performance-tuned 802.11r and 802.11k protocols, testing web surfing, video streaming, and bidirectional video teleconferencing. Results show a 2.4–4.7× improvement in TCP download performance and a 2.6–4.0× improvement in UDP download performance at vehicular speeds ranging from 5 to 25 mph.

We survey related work in the area, highlighting the limitations of existing solutions and the advantages of our approach.

## 7. Future Work
We discuss potential future work, including extending the system to larger-scale deployments and integrating with emerging wireless technologies.

## 8. Conclusion
Wi-Fi Goes to Town addresses the challenges of high-speed vehicular networking by leveraging fine-grained AP selection and queue management, integrated with modern Wi-Fi features. Our system significantly improves throughput and reliability in the vehicular picocell regime.
