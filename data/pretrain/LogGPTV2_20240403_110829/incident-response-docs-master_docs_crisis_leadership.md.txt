# Crisis Leadership: Navigating Your Organization Through Turbulent Times

Effective crisis management hinges on strong leadership. Crisis leadership involves applying your organization’s core values throughout all stages of a crisis, ensuring a balanced and thoughtful response.

## Why Crisis Leadership Is Essential

Every crisis presents both danger and opportunity. The right kind of leadership is crucial in these critical moments. Values-driven crisis leadership maintains a delicate balance between addressing what went wrong and capitalizing on the effectiveness of your response. When your company’s values are at the forefront, stakeholder communications and public statements remain consistent, avoiding the pitfalls of backpedaling or bandwagoning. No two crises are alike, just as no two organizations are identical. Crisis leadership centers on you telling your organization’s story, from one crisis to the next, with consistency and authenticity.

## Considerations for Crisis Leaders

The unpredictable and fluid nature of a crisis demands situational awareness. Understanding what you know and don’t know is crucial. Continuously monitoring the situation, predicting changes, and being prepared to adapt to the evolving environment ensures your team remains cohesive and focused on the same goal.

Another critical aspect of crisis leadership is taking care of yourself and your team. Members of your crisis response team may be personally affected by the events but still need to work to resolve them. Some team members may have been awake for 24 hours and need permission to step away. Fatigue can set in, so leveraging tools like PagerDuty for on-call rotations, hand-offs, and integrating video conferencing technology (e.g., Zoom or Teams) can help create a safe and healthy on-call culture.

## Do's and Don'ts for Leading a Crisis

Successful and unsuccessful corporate responses to crises are common. Learning from others' mistakes and developing a set of core principles can be invaluable. Here are some common do's and don'ts:

- **DO** have a set of generic holding statements ready that can be easily customized for specific situations (e.g., vendor bankruptcy, cyber incident, product recall, high-profile departure).
- **DO** be cautious about when and how you respond, as there is always a risk that the news could break before you’ve commented.
- **DO** be measured in your response and avoid trying to address every negative post, inquiry, or attack.
- **DON’T** assume multiple crises or incidents happening simultaneously are related.
- **DON’T** copy and paste—take actions that are unique to your organization’s values, history, and risk profile, or you’ll risk greater exposure.
- **DON’T** assume that making proactive, non-obligatory public statements is without great risk; carefully weigh your decision with your legal team.
- **DON’T** assume that what you've said internally or to a subset of customers or investors won’t go public.

## Crisis Scenario Planning

Crisis leaders should always plan for the worst-case scenario. If the 2020 pandemic was your first existential crisis, it likely won’t be your last. Referencing your company’s historical crises while planning is one piece of the puzzle. However, scenario planning is forward-looking and focuses on the most likely and most damaging scenarios to proactively develop teams, plans, and playbooks. Examples include:

- Critical infrastructure attack (e.g., power, water, transportation)
- Cyber incident (e.g., ransomware, data breach)
- Pandemics (e.g., contagions)
- Environmental disaster (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, drought)
- Human resources crisis (e.g., union strikes, walk-outs, labor shortage)
- Geopolitical disaster (e.g., war, coup d’etat)
- Terrorism (e.g., political violence, sabotage)
- Economic disaster (e.g., stock market crash, currency crisis)
- Industrial accident (e.g., gas leak, building collapse)

While it’s impossible to plan for every scenario, the goal is to select a few and build transferable principles and skills that prepare you for a wider range of crises. Focus on the consequences across your scenarios and solve for capability gaps by adding controls such as playbooks, runbooks, or predefined tactical response teams. Periodic review of your top scenarios and associated plans and teams is also important.

## Assembling an Executive Crisis Leadership Team

Developing an Executive Crisis Leadership Team is a good starting point. This group should consist of functional business owners from all areas of your organization, including Communications, Legal, Human Resources, and more. Consider the following roles:

- Chief Executive Officer
- Chief Legal Officer
- Chief Communications Officer
- Chief Financial Officer
- Chief Information Security Officer
- Chief Human Resource Officer
- Chief Operating Officer
- Chief Information Officer
- Chief Resilience Officer
- Chief Revenue Officer
- Chief Marketing Officer
- Chief Security Officer

It’s important to tailor the team to your organization’s needs. Also, consider your Board of Directors as an extension of the team and document essential external contacts like Public Relations/Crisis Management firms, Disaster Recovery services, insurance providers, Digital Forensic Specialists, or Local/Federal authorities.

## Crisis Team Leaders

Putting a face and a single voice to a crisis is crucial. A Crisis Team Leader is responsible for leading the organization through a crisis, based on their area(s) of expertise. They function similarly to an Incident Commander but may oversee multiple Incident Commanders in complex situations. Assigning members of your organization as team leaders and their backups is the next step. Here’s an example table:

| **Crisis Scenario** | **Scenario Examples** | **Crisis Team Leader** | **Potential Backup** |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Critical infrastructure attack | Energy grid, water supply, telecommunications | Chief Operating Officer | Logistics Chief |
| Environmental disaster | Earthquake, hurricane, volcano | Chief Resilience Officer | Safety Chief |
| Human resources crisis | Labor strike, protests, labor violation | Chief Human Resource Officer | Operations Chief |
| Marketing campaign failure | Typo, untrue product claim, wrong tone | Chief Digital Officer | Communications Chief |

Using PagerDuty, you can build your [on-call schedule](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/schedule-basics) within the platform, providing visibility and accountability. You can also add backups using an escalation policy that alerts the next person after a custom time delay.

To balance the load for your on-call team, [round-robin scheduling](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/round-robin-scheduling) can help by alternating who is notified for each crisis notification.

## Succession Planning

As you examine the makeup of your Executive Crisis Leadership Team, Crisis Team Leaders, and their backups, consider succession planning or failover mapping. Depending on your organization’s geographical concentrations, diversifying your members can spread the risk. If everyone is concentrated in one area, an impact to that region can lead to extended recovery times. Ensure your PagerDuty rotations and escalation policies reflect this strategy.

By following these guidelines, your organization will be better prepared to navigate through any crisis with resilience and integrity.
