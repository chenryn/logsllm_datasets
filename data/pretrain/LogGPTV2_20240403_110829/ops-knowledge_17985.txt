Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system performing various operations. The DataNode component is terminating PacketResponders and receiving blocks from other nodes. The FSNamesystem component is allocating blocks and updating the blockMap with stored blocks from other nodes.
