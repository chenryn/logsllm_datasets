ABSTRACT
Telephone spam has become an increasingly prevalent problem
in many countries all over the world. For example, the US Fed-
eral Trade Commission’s (FTC) National Do Not Call Registry’s
number of cumulative complaints of spam/scam calls reached 30.9
million submissions in 2016. Naturally, telephone carriers can play
an important role in the fight against spam. However, due to the
extremely large volume of calls that transit across large carrier
networks, it is challenging to mine their vast amounts of call detail
records (CDRs) to accurately detect and block spam phone calls.
This is because CDRs only contain high-level metadata (e.g., source
and destination numbers, call start time, call duration, etc.) related
to each phone call. In addition, ground truth about both benign
and spam-related phone numbers is often very scarce (only a tiny
fraction of all phone numbers can be labeled). More importantly,
telephone carriers are extremely sensitive to false positives, as they
need to avoid blocking any non-spam calls, making the detection
of spam-related numbers even more challenging.
In this paper, we present a novel detection system that aims to
discover telephone numbers involved in spam campaigns. Given
a small seed of known spam phone numbers, our system uses a
combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning
methods to mine new, previously unknown spam numbers from
large datasets of call detail records (CDRs). Our objective is not to
detect all possible spam phone calls crossing a carrier’s network,
but rather to expand the list of known spam numbers while aiming
for zero false positives, so that the newly discovered numbers may
be added to a phone blacklist, for example. To evaluate our system,
we have conducted experiments over a large dataset of real-world
CDRs provided by a leading telephony provider in China, while
tuning the system to produce no false positives. The experimental

1 INTRODUCTION
Telephone spam has become an increasingly prevalent problem in
many countries all over the world [19]. For example, the Federal
Trade Commission’s (FTC) National Do Not Call Registry’s number
of cumulative complaints of spam/scam calls in the US reached
30.9 million in 2016 [6]. 360 Security, a leading Internet and mobile
security provider in China, received 234 million user complaints
on spam/scam phone call via their mobile app in 2016, and its
app detected 38.5 billion spam/scam phone calls in 2016 [17] (in
Chinese). 360 Security also reports that the success rate of scam
phone calls is about 0.1% (i.e., much larger than spam emails), which
means that the spammers may have successfully defrauded one out
of every 1000 users.
In light of this, a number of countermeasures have been proposed
to deal with telephone spam. Reputation-based systems, such as
[10, 14, 21], assign and maintain reputation scores for individual
callers within a community, in which the scores are computed and
updated based on caller-specific information. Although reputation
systems allow the recipient’s terminal to block spam calls, they
typically require a large amount of user-related information that
may pose privacy risks. Another popular approach is to identify
spam callers according to their behavioral features, such as call
volume [18, 21], call duration time [1, 11], and recipient diversity
[2, 9].
Such a system has to update the callers’ behavioral feature in-
formation frequently to ensure accuracy and effectiveness. How-
ever, spam callers could circumvent being identified with delib-
erate tricks. For example, spammers could employ several collud-
ing source numbers [18] to distribute the spam calls among them

systems suffer from false positives which limits their real-world
deployment as telephone carriers cannot afford to block non-spam
calls.
Naturally, telephone carriers can play an important role in the
fight against spam. However, due to the extremely large volume of
calls that transit across large carrier networks, it is challenging to
mine their vast amounts of call detail records (CDRs) to accurately
detect and block spam phone calls. This is because CDRs only con-
tain high-level metadata (e.g., source and destination numbers, call
start time, call duration, etc.) related to each phone call. In addition,
ground truth about both benign and spam-related phone numbers
is often very scarce (only a tiny fraction of all phone numbers can
be quickly labeled). More importantly, telephone carriers are ex-
tremely sensitive to false positives, as they need to avoid blocking
any non-spam calls, making the detection of spam-related numbers
even more challenging.
In this paper, we present a novel detection system that aims to
discover telephone numbers involved in spam campaigns. Given
a small seed of known spam phone numbers, our system uses a
combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning
methods to mine new, previously unknown spam numbers from
large datasets of call detail records (CDRs). Our objective is not to
detect all possible spam phone calls crossing a carrier’s network,
but rather to expand the list of known spam numbers while aiming
for zero false positives, so that the newly discovered numbers may
be added to a phone blacklist, for example.
It is worth noting that while source phone numbers can be ma-
nipulated via caller ID spoofing, recent research reported in the
“2016 China Spam Phone Call Trend Analysis Report” [4] (in Chi-
nese) indicates that the average life time of a spam phone number
is 6.61 days, and that each spam number attempts to reach an av-
erage of 255 users while it is active. This indicates that detecting
and blacklisting spam phone numbers can be an effective strategy,
as long as the blacklist can be frequently updated (e.g., every few
days). In addition, a number of proposals have been put forward by
government agencies and telephone networks on how to perform
caller ID authentication to mitigate spoofing [5]. Therefore, once
caller ID authentication becomes more pervasive, the effectiveness
of blacklists will increase even more.
Our approach for detecting spam phone numbers is based on the
following hypothesis. Given a set of destination phone numbers
assigned to a given region, a spam campaign targeting that region
may be launched by: (1) using a set of (potentially spoofed) source
phone numbers from which spam calls can be originated; (2) split-
ting the list of target (i.e., destination) region numbers into subsets;
(3) assigning a (possibly random) subset of target numbers to each
spam source number; and (4) instructing (often programmatically)
each source phone number to make calls to their respective assigned
target numbers.
To verify the above intuitions about how spam campaigns are
often conducted, in this paper we first analyze a large dataset of
real-world CDRs provided by a leading telephone provider in China.
To this end, we leverage information about a seed of known spam
phone numbers provided by the telephone network itself and by
Baidu, and measure the “relationships” (in terms of call patterns)
between the spam numbers. We then contrast these measurements
with similar measurements performed over a set of benign phone
numbers. This initial analysis allowed us to identify two important
features, which we then leverage for detection. Spam numbers will
naturally tend to have a relatively large call volume (i.e., number
of calls issued) per day. Furthermore, if we consider the destination
numbers called by each spam phone number, different spam num-
bers may call similar destinations, where similarity is defined based
on common phone number prefixes. On the other hand, benign
phone numbers tend to exhibit mostly uncorrelated (or non-similar)
calling behavior, when considering the destination numbers they
contact.
In summary, we make the following main contributions:
• We collect and analyze real-world CDRs from a large tele-
phone network and identify two main features, namely sim-
ilarity in call volume and call destination prefixes, that can
be leveraged to detect previously unknown spam numbers.
• We propose a novel telephone spam detection system that
combines unsupervised and supervised learning methods to
mine large CDR datasets. Given a seed of known spam phone
numbers, our system is able to discover new, previously
unknown spam numbers that could then be added to phone
blacklists.
• We conduct experiments over a recent large set of real-world
CDRs collected across multiple days. To conduct our experi-
ments, we tune our detector to produce no false positives,
and show that we are still able to greatly expand on the
initial seed of known spam numbers by up to about 250%.
2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we briefly present the state-of-the-art techniques
and approaches to identify or detect communication spammers. Tu
et al. [19] provide an overview of telephone spam and a comprehen-
sive reference for the existing anti-telephone spam solutions which
mainly include employing black and white lists, caller reputation
based systems, caller behavior analysis, voice interactive screening,
and caller compliance. Here we discuss some of the most related
studies, and, in particular, some related literatures that apply ma-
chine learning related approaches to detect spammers and compare
them to our proposed novel system that combines supervised and
unsupervised schemes to detect new and previously unknown spam
telephone numbers in a real-world setting.
Static blacklists and whitelists are two basic techniques sug-
gested by many previous literatures (e.g. [7, 15]) to detect and block
telephone spams. However, both techniques face challenges. On one
hand, whitelists would always block unknown legitimate callers,
and on the other hand, static blacklists require frequent updates to
catch up with newly emerging spam numbers. The main purpose
of our proposed system is to discover telephone numbers involved
in spam campaigns to augment blacklists with zero false alarms on
daily basis.
A notable number of previous work proposed methods to combat
SPIT (Spam Over Internet Telephony) in VoIP networks. Different
behavioral patterns are proposed in these studies. In [1], for ex-
ample, the authors indicate that simultaneous calls, call intervals,
volume, and duration could be used to detect spam over VoIP net-
works. Authors of [3] followed to summarize most of available

identification criteria that could be used by classification algorithms.
Some of other methods to detect VoIP spammers operate based on
the generation of social networks and associations among users.
For example, CallRank [2] builds social network linkages among
the users where the caller sends its credentials, which includes pre-
vious call durations, to the recipient of the call. The recipient of the
call utilizes this information along with the global reputation of the
caller to decide whether the call should be answered or rejected. Ba-
sically, call credentials indicate how active the callers have been in
the recent history and how often calls have been made or received
by them with considerable call durations. Similarly, relationships
and associations among VoIP users, call duration, and a few other
behavioral features are used in [11] to build a detection system
for SPITters. In another similar study, Kolan et al. [10] propose an
approach to detect VoIP spammers based on trust and reputation
which are maintained for each user and built through user feedback
and propagated via social networks.
The authors of [23] apply semi-supervised clustering with SIP
(Session Initiation Protocol) related parameters as features, such
as # of SIP INVITE messages, # of ACK messages, and # of BYE
messages from caller and recipient. They introduce user feedback on
individual phone call as constraints of must-link or cannot-link to
the K-Means algorithm to generate clusters, and predict as spam the
numbers in clusters that contain more specified spam numbers than
specified benign numbers according to user feedbacks. Wang et al.
[20] employ new features of call interaction relationship between
caller and recipient like ratio of outgoing and incoming calls on
the K-Means algorithm in their proposed detection system. Su et al.
[16] propose a prevention system to identify spam phone numbers
by applying KNN classification algorithm with multiple features
such as long term and short term duration time, diversity of callers
and recipients, and call rate. In [18], the authors describe a model
with their proposed features including call duration, call volume
and call back rate to detect spam callers that employ a group of
colluding telephone numbers. They implement their model with
both K-Means and PAM clustering algorithms.
There are significant differences between these works and our
proposed system. First, these works are related to detecting SPIT
in VoIP networks. Hence some of the features and techniques used
to detect spammers in such networks cannot be applied in regular
telephone calls. Some examples of these features and techniques
include using message sizes in [3], packet related errors in [1],
message passing and credential propagation in [2], and connection
properties such as participating proxies in routing calls in [10]. In
contrast, our proposed system dose not have any specific require-
ment for the telephone network, and uses real-world CDR records
and relies on features that are easily computable from these records.
Second, majority of the aforementioned detection systems were
designed and evaluated using synthetic data and in a simulated
environment, whereas our system is designed using real-world
data containing millions of call records. As exceptions, [18] and
[16] collect small sets of real benign numbers (for example, the
phone numbers of faculty and students) and, unfortunately, gener-
ate synthetic calls, including spam calls to evaluate their systems.
Obviously, these datasets are not representative of real-world CDR
records.
Third, one of the most important characteristics of our system
is that it avoids producing any false positives during operation.
However, all the studies discussed above generate a notable number
of false alarms.
Fourth, our system uses a novel combination of supervised and
unsupervised machine learning techniques to automatically learn
the system parameters such as the most optimum clustering out-
come from the data. However, studies such as [18] and [16] use
predefined settings and configurations. For example, the number of
output source number clusters is preset to two in [18], i.e. one spam
cluster and one non-spam one. This inevitably leads to very high
false positive rates. Furthermore, we introduce novel features, such
as the destination number prefixes, and an effective self-tuning
