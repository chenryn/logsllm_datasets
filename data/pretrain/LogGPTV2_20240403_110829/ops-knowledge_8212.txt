User: I want to get the full command line as it was typed.
This:
" ".join(sys.argv[:])
doesn't work here (deletes double quotes). Also I prefer not to rejoin something that was parsed and split.
Any ideas?
Assistant: On Linux there is /proc/<pid>/cmdline that is in the format of argv[] (i.e. there is 0x00 between all the lines and you can't really know how many strings there are since you don't get the argc; though you will know it when the file runs out of data ;).
You can be sure that that commandline is already munged too since all escaping/variable filling is done and parameters are nicely packaged (no extra spaces between parameters, etc.).
