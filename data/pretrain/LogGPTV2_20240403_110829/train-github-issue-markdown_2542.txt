bug  
**What is the current behavior?**  
style attribute is not updated correctly when we set `padding` and
`paddingTop` at the same time and then re-render with only `padding`. Same
issue with `border`. I suppose that it would be the same with `margin` (not
tested)
Example: http://codepen.io/testerez/pen/pNRQjW?editors=0010
**What is the expected behavior?**  
The DOM element style should be the last rendered one and should not be
affected by the previous style value.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
Tested on chrome 54 with React 15.4 and 15.3.2
