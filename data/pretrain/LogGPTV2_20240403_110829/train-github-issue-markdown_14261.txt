Reason of this:
  1. Since tests are not under BC promise someone should not extend them.. You could ask "why someone to extend a test of symfony?"... I think we all have see an lot of weird stuff out there
  2. PHPStorm improvements for autocompletion while typing `MyClass extends T.....` it will not show the tests..
This is a little bit different from #29677 ... because `internal` will be used
only for stubs and will prevent them from be used in the actual code and
hopefully at some point PHPStorm will improve search on this..
Let me know if I can submit a PR about this...
