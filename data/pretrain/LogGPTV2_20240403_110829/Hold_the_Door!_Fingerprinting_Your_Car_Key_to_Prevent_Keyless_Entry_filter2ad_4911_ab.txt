a request from the vehicle within the LF band, but also a
response from a key fob within the UHF band. Accordingly,
in a dual-band relay attack, the PKES system can be attacked
even if the key fob is much farther away from the vehicle
during a single-band relay attack. Adversaries intending to
commit a dual-band attack must also possess industry-standard
equipment in order to relay both the LF-band and the UHF-
band RF signals. The UHF-band signals can be delivered to the
vehicle by a signal-extending module [10], [19], or through two
adversaries, one who would record and forward the UHF-band
signal out of communication range and the other who would
inject the forwarded signal into the vehicle [18]. We denote the
former as an Ampliﬁcation attack and the latter as a Digital
relay attack. The difference between the two attack types
is whether the adversaries perform digital communication to
forward binary information contained in LF/UHF-band signals.
During an Ampliﬁcation attack, adversaries simply am-
plify both the LF band and the UHF-band signals using the
RF ampliﬁer. There are two ways to inject UHF-band signals
to the vehicle. First, the adversary at the key fob side ampliﬁes
the UHF-band signals and directly injects it into the vehicle.
Second, both adversaries amplify the UHF-band signals. Al-
though the latter case can produce a higher signal strength than
the former, the RF ampliﬁer intensiﬁes both the pass-band
signal and the noise leading to unintended feature variation.
Therefore, in Section V, we have simulated an ampliﬁcation
attack based on the former case. In a Digital relay attack, ad-
versaries perform the whole process of digital communication
to inject an attack signal. Adversaries demodulate and decode
the LF/UHF-band signal to forward binary information to each
other. The delivery of binary information can be conducted
through various wireless communication systems such as Wi-
Fi or Bluetooth. After receiving the binary information, the
adversary injects an attack signal through an encoding and
modulation process. The advantage of a digital relay attack is
that the communication range can be much larger than with a
single-band relay attack or ampliﬁcation attack. This is because
binary information is forwarded through state-of-the-art digital
communication. However, since most PKES systems assign
a maximum delay [38], the attack signal should be injected
within the maximum delay period. Nevertheless, researchers
have shown that digital relay attacks can be successfully
mounted with cheap RF devices [18].
3) Cryptographic attacks: An adversary can extend the
communication range between a vehicle and its key fob, as
well as mount a cryptographic attack. In a cryptographic attack,
the adversary exploits the weaknesses of the cryptographic
algorithm which is equipped in the PKES system. In the
vicinity of the key fob, the adversary injects malicious LF-band
signals (challenge) to the key fob and collects the UHF-band
signals (response). Due to the lack of mutual authentication
in the PKES system, the key fob accepts malicious LF-band
signals and transmits corresponding responses. After collecting
sufﬁcient challenge and response pairs, the adversary performs
cryptanalysis to extract a long-term secret key. Consequently,
the adversary can inject valid UHF-band signals depending
on a challenge signal from the vehicle. A 2018 study has
shown that the PKES system of Telsa Model S is equipped
with a weak cryptographic algorithm and does not require
mutual authentication [66]. Researchers have uncovered that
the outdated proprietary cipher DST40 has been mounted to
the Telsa Model S. Furthermore, unrevealed PKES systems
with weak cryptographic algorithms or key management failure
[40] are also expected to be vulnerable to a cryptograhic attack,
given that the adversary extracts the binary code and injects the
attack signal. With regards to HODOR, this attack scenario is
considered to be the same as the transmitted signal that would
be analyzed in a digital relay attack.
4) Attacks on RKE systems: We categorized the attacks
on PKES systems as Single-Band Relay, Dual-Band Relay,
and Cryptographic Attack. In addition, previous studies have
shown that where a long-term secret key is used in an RKE
system, it can be compromised by an adversary through the
use of cryptanalysis with reverse engineering [22], [24], [45],
[61], an exhaustive key search [47], [63], or combining both
methods [40]. As a result, an adversary can generate a valid
packet in a similar manner to a cryptographic attack. To the
best of our knowledge, our cryptographic attack model also
covers all known attacks on RKE systems except a rolljam
attack. In a rolljam attack, an adversary performs a jamming
attack and eavesdrops on valid UHF signals. When the driver
presses the unlock button on the key fob, the vehicle remains
locked because the signal has been blocked by the jamming
attack, and the driver will naturally attempt to unlock the door
again. This creates a second signal that is also recorded and
blocked, however, at this time, the adversary replays the ﬁrst
code to unlock the door. As a result, the driver assumes that
the key fob is working normally. However, the adversary can
now inject an attack signal using a second rolling code which
has not been received by the vehicle.
IV. OUR METHOD: HODOR
A. Overview
In this section, we explain our design decisions to realize
HODOR. Fig. 4 shows an overview of HODOR’s architecture.
HODOR aims at detecting an attack signal using a classiﬁer
which is generated by legitimate signals only. There are two
main phases in HODOR: the Training phase and the Attack
Detection phase. In the Training phase, HODOR creates a clas-
siﬁer based on a training dataset which contains only legitimate
signals. Through preprocessing and feature extraction, a set
4
Fig. 4: Overview of HODOR architecture
of features per RF signal are obtained and the classiﬁer is
trained. In addition, normalization parameters, which are used
for output normalization in the Attack Detection phase, are
computed. After the classiﬁer is trained, in the Attack Detection
phase, HODOR is now able to detect any attacks deﬁned in
our attack model in Section III-B. In the Attack Detection
phase, HODOR receives a new RF signal which contains a
door unlock request. Then, HODOR conducts preprocessing and
feature extraction on this newly received RF signal, as outlined
in the Training phase. The extracted feature set is used as
input to the trained classiﬁer, and HODOR makes a decision
whether the received RF signal has been transmitted from a
legitimate key fob or not. This decision is made based on the
normalized output of the classiﬁer and a pre-deﬁned threshold.
In an invalid case, when the normalized output is larger than
the threshold, the corresponding door unlock request is not
validated and HODOR alerts the BCM module.
B. Preprocessing
At
the outset, HODOR receives UHF-band RF signals,
which become preprocessed as illustrated in Fig. 5. The
received signal, including a carrier signal c(t), a baseband
signal s(t), and channel noise n(t), is denoted as follows.
r(t) = s(t) ⊗ c(t) + n(t)
(1)
where ⊗ is the operation for the mixer. The carrier signal is
a sinusoidal signal at the carrier frequency (fc) of the UHF
band. To obtain meaningful information for analysis located
in the baseband signal, the carrier signal must be removed.
In other words, the received raw signal is shifted back down
to the baseband by mixing the sinusoidal signal at the same
carrier frequency as follows.
r[t] ⊗ c[t] = s[t] + n[t] ⊗ c[t]
(2)
It should be noted that HODOR samples a continuous analog
RF signal, and owing to this, we denote the sampled signal
as [t] which represents discrete values. To remove n[t] ⊗ c[t],
the bandpass ﬁlter is performed on r[t] ⊗ c[t]. As a result, we
obtain the baseband signal s[t] from the received signal r[t].
Subsequently, HODOR demodulates the baseband signal s[t]
into a pulse signal d[t]. The pulse signal is encoded from a
binary code. As mentioned in Section III-B, FSK and ASK
are typical modulation schemes used in keyless entry systems,
which are determined by manufacturers. After demodulation,
Fig. 5: Preprocessing block diagram
the pulse signal is normalized to scale its power to a certain
value. Since the received signal strength (RSS) is determined
by a channel condition, it would be difﬁcult to reliably extract
the features under noisy channel conditions. To be independent
to the degree of RSS, HODOR applies root-mean-square (RMS)
normalization, through which the power of a demodulated
signal is scaled as 1. For example, if d[t] is composed of
N samples (d1, d2, ..., dN ), the RMS-normalized signal is
calculated as follows.
dRM S[t] =

C. Feature Extraction
On the preprocessed signals, HODOR extracts salient fea-
tures by which a legitimate request and a malicious attempt
are distinct. In wireless transmissions,
the radio preamble
(sometimes called a header) is used to synchronize the clock
between a transceiver and a receiver. Preamble has a static bit
sequence independent of the data packet. HODOR extracts the
features from the preamble of the pulse signal since it allows
HODOR to extract features independent of the data and the key
fob. We propose four types of features: i) peak frequency, ii)
frequency offset, iii) SNR, and iv) a set of statistical features.
Peak frequency. Peak frequency is a feature in a frequency
domain. Since the preamble part of a time-domain pulse signal
is given, it must be transformed to the frequency-domain signal
by fast fourier transform (FFT). Fig. 6 shows the preamble part
of the UHF-band RF signal transmitted from a key fob and its
FFT result. It can be seen that several dominant peaks exist
in the frequency-domain preamble signal. The peak frequency
(fpeak) is the frequency where the highest amplitude value
exists as follows.
fpeak = arg max
f
|DRM S[f ]|
(4)
where DRM S[f ]
is the FFT result of dRM S[t]. The peak
frequency feature is affected by a clock source used for micro
controllers. Because of the imperfection of clock sources,
different peak frequency values can be extracted from different
RF devices. Accordingly, this feature is used to distinguish
a legitimate key fob from other devices used for malicious
attacks.
Carrier frequency offset. Carrier frequency offset is
another feature in the frequency domain of a preamble signal.
Different from peak frequency, carrier frequency offset is the
feature that is extracted from the baseband signal s[t] which is
shown in Fig. 2. As each key fob has a non-ideal (i.e., deviated
from 433.92MHz) carrier frequency (f(cid:48)
c) due to the hardware
imperfection, the RF receiver works on a wide band to reliably
receive signals from the key fob [67] in a real vehicle. This
5
an overﬁtting problem can when a large number of features
are included, and thus, we performed an exhaustive feature
selection by limiting the number to ﬁve [42]. Interestingly, all
of the crafted features were selected by the feature selection
algorithm and the remaining two features were kurtosis and
spectral brightness. Table I shows the features selected for
HODOR according to the modulation scheme. Kurtosis is a
measure of the peakedness of the sampled signal in the time
domain. As the signal propagates through the air, noise signals
and multipath signals affect signal quality. In addition, since
the passband signal and noise signals are also intensiﬁed by an
analog ampliﬁer, and external ampliﬁcation affects the kurtosis
of the signal. Therefore, single-band relay and ampliﬁcation
attacks inhere greater kurtosis values than a legitimate signal.
The kurtosis is calculated as follows.
(cid:34)(cid:18) dRM S − µ
(cid:19)4(cid:35)
σ
Kurtosis = E
(6)
0.5×fs(cid:88)
where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of
the dRM S, respectively. Spectral brightness is the amount of
spectral energy corresponding to frequencies higher than a
given cut-off threshold. In a playback attack, the adversary
records the legitimate signal. In this process,the baseband
RF signal goes through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
and is digitally sampled. However, digital sampling introduces
a quantization error due to the sampling rate and vertical
resolution of ADC. When the attack is mounted, these sam-
ples go through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and are
reconstructed to an analog baseband signal. At this point, the
quantization error introduced during digital sampling affects
the spectral density of the reconstructed signal [65]. Spectral
brightness is calculated as follows.
SpectralBrightness =
|DRM S[f ]|2
(7)
where fth is the threshold frequency and fs is the sampling
frequency. In our evaluation, we assigned fth as 0.1 × fs.
f =fth

D. Training and Attack Detection
Before attack detection, HODOR requires a one-class clas-
siﬁer, which facilitates attack detection. One-class classiﬁers
are trained with a set of features derived exclusively from a
legitimate key fob. Feature extraction during training can only
occur via the legitimate key fobs, and as such, the classiﬁers
are created via semi-supervised learning. Table I shows the
features used for each modulation scheme. After the classiﬁers
are trained, HODOR assigns a threshold for each classiﬁer.
Considering implementation in a real vehicle, it is necessary

frequency domain
imperfection also occurs in the receiver, which leads the non-
ideal frequency of f(cid:48)(cid:48)
c when generating c(t). Consequently,
when the r(t) is mixed with c(t), the baseband signal (s[t]) in
c − f(cid:48)(cid:48)
Equation (2) has a different frequency offset value (f(cid:48)
c )
according to each transmitter and receiver pair. We exploit this
frequency difference as a feature to verify legitimate key fobs
and denote it as f of f set
.

SNR. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure that com-
pares the level of a desired signal to the level of background
noise. SNR is deﬁned as the ratio of signal power to noise
power. In addition, SNR is expressed in decibels (dB) as
follows.
SN RdB = 10 log10
Psignal
Pnoise
(5)
Where Psignal
is the power of a demodulated signal (i.e.,
meaningful information) and Pnoise is the power of back-
ground noise (i.e., unwanted signal). It is noted that measures
greater than 0 dB indicate more signal than noise. In the PKES
system, a UHF-band RF signal emitted at a larger distance than
the proximity distance should be considered malicious even if
the signal is from the legitimate key fob. Since a feature of
SNR is easily affected by channel conditions, path loss, or
the reduction in power density of a signal as it propagates
through space, can be estimated. By analyzing the features of
SNR, HODOR is able to verify whether a particular signal has
been generated within a speciﬁc vicinity.
Statistical features. To support the above features, a set
of statistical features were also employed. Statistical features
represent the various characteristics of a sampled signal. As
a result, numerous studies on signal processing and wireless
communication area employed statistical features for node or
channel
identiﬁcation [33], [34], [54]. Since the hardware
characteristics of an attack device and channel condition
