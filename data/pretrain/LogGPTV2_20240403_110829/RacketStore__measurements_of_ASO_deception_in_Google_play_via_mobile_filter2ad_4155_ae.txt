### Exposure of Personal Information to Threats

In §6.4, we demonstrate that workers are aware of and concerned about the risks posed by malware apps. To avoid detection, workers may be compelled to register fewer accounts and post fewer reviews for promoted apps from these accounts. This reduction in fraudulent activities can significantly diminish worker profits from ASO (App Store Optimization) activities.

### Recruitment Bias

We recruited ASO workers through Facebook groups dedicated to product promotion, selecting only those who responded, were English speakers, and agreed to participate after approving the consent form. Our Instagram recruitment process reached 61,748 English-speaking Instagram users within a specific age range, with interests related to Android applications, and who were willing to participate after approving the consent form.

To mitigate the impact of cultural factors in our analysis, we aimed to recruit both workers and regular users from similar regions. Although the distribution of workers and regular users is not uniform across most countries, 96% of the worker devices and 92% of the regular devices (based on potentially unreliable IP-based geolocation) appear to be from the geographically close regions of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.

We do not claim that our results generalize to all workers and regular users, including those from the same or other countries. Additionally, workers accessible through other recruitment channels, such as [13], may exhibit different behaviors and strategies. A larger-scale recruitment process could identify further types of ASO workers and more diverse regular users. 

### Device and App Usage Analysis

**Figure 14:** The top 10 most important features for the device classifier, measured by mean decrease in Gini, suggest that devices controlled by workers are distinguishable from regular devices based on the total number of apps reviewed, the percentage of apps used suspiciously, and the number of stopped apps.

**Figure 15:** A scatterplot of 178 worker-controlled devices (one dot per device) showing app suspiciousness versus the number of apps installed and reviewed from accounts registered on the device. This reveals that classifiers can detect a range of worker-controlled devices, including those dedicated to promotion and those with usage patterns indicative of organic use.

Of the remaining 55 devices, it appears they were used exclusively for app promotion: all their apps exhibited promotion-indicative behaviors, with a median of 31 Gmail accounts (M = 37.18, max = 114) and a median of 23 stopped apps (M = 66.23).

We manually investigated devices with high but less than 100% app suspiciousness and confirmed that such devices likely have apps installed and used for personal purposes. Examples include train ticketing apps used at similar times over multiple days, photo gallery apps used alternately with video players, Samsung pre-installed messaging (com.samsung.android.messaging) and call (com.samsung.android.incallui) apps, and music apps like Google Play Music being used daily.

However, the classifiers were able to accurately detect even worker-controlled devices with low app suspiciousness, which may belong to novice workers.

### Discussion and Limitations

#### Who Should Deploy RacketStore?

The classifiers proposed in §§7 and 8 require more information than what is publicly available via app stores (e.g., through Google APIs). Thus, the deployment of RacketStore is best suited for entities with access to such detailed data.

#### Related Efforts

Extensive work has been done to detect malware Android apps, such as [29, 41, 54, 60, 61, 69–71, 95]. Notably, Yang et al. [91] differentiate malware from benign apps based on the contexts that trigger security-sensitive behaviors. RacketStore detects ASO-promoted apps and worker-controlled devices based on the context of user interactions. While we aim to detect worker interactions with apps, it is noted that ASO work has been used to promote malware apps and improve their search rankings, thus increasing their consumer appeal [68].

Our study of the fraud market for Google services is related to other explorations of fraud markets [55, 74–76]. For instance, Dou et al. [37] developed a honeypot app to collect data and detect fraudulent bot-generated downloads. Mirian et al. [55] explored the market for Gmail account hijacking by creating synthetic but realistic victim personas and hiring services to hack into such accounts. DeBlasio et al. [36] characterized the search engine fraud ecosystem using internal data from the Bing search engine. Stringhini et al. [74] studied Twitter follower markets by purchasing followers from different merchants and using this ground truth to discover patterns and detect market-controlled accounts.

In this paper, we leverage our finding of an abundant fraud market for Google services (i.e., review groups with tens of thousands of members) to recruit hundreds of worker-controlled devices, study their usage, and propose solutions to detect and distinguish them from devices used for personal purposes.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we developed RacketStore, the first platform to collect detailed app and device usage information from the devices of ASO workers and regular users of Google Play services. We presented empirical data from RacketStore installs on 803 devices and interviews with some of their owners. We developed a classifier to identify apps installed solely for promotion, achieving an F1-measure exceeding 99% on our data. We showed that features modeling user interaction with a device can detect even organic devices with low levels of ASO work hidden among personal activities. Our techniques are resilient to worker strategy modifications, which would impose high overhead on the operation of their devices and the usage of the apps they promote.

### Classifier Performance

Several machine learning algorithms achieved an F1-measure exceeding 99% for the app classification problem (§7.2), while one algorithm achieved an F1-measure over 95% for the device classification problem (§8.2). The investigation in §6 provides intuition for the ability of several features to help classifiers distinguish between apps and devices used for personal purposes versus ASO work. This suggests that these algorithms did not overfit the data. The success of these classifiers indicates that standard ML algorithms are suitable and preferable for these classification problems, where they can provide valuable interpretation.

We acknowledge, however, that the relatively small and biased data used to train the app and device classifiers (see recruitment bias above) may limit their applicability to data from other ASO workers and regular users.

### Influence of RacketStore on Participant Behaviors

Knowledge of being monitored might have influenced participant behaviors. However, all participants, including ASO workers and regular users, installed the same version of RacketStore and were provided with the same information before and during the study. Our classifiers were able to distinguish between apps and devices used by ASO workers and regular users, even if ASO workers attempted to modify their behaviors during the study.

### Related Work

Farooqi et al. [38] studied the market of incentivized app install platforms (IIP) through a honey app that collects device IDs, lists of installed apps, and events such as opening the app and in-app interactions. RacketStore extends Farooqi et al. [38]'s work by collecting and analyzing additional key data, including the list of user accounts registered on the participant device, the reviews posted from those accounts, and the foreground app at 5-second intervals. This data enables us to claim a first success in identifying organic ASO activities. Our study involved diverse types of ASO workers recruited from Facebook groups and regular users recruited using Instagram ads.

Our work is particularly relevant given findings that some ASO workers have evolved strategies [67, 94] to evade detection by both app stores and academic solutions, such as [27, 28, 32, 32, 35, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 48, 50, 51, 51–53, 53, 57–59, 72, 73, 78, 84–89, 92, 92, 93]. For example, Zheng et al. [94] report the emergence of organic workers who attempt to mimic the behavior of real users. Rahman et al. [67] provide insights from studied ASO workers, confirming the existence of organic workers in the wild. In this paper, we provide measurements from devices of ASO workers and regular Android users. Our data suggests that the use of apps installed for promotion differs from that of apps used for personal purposes. Even organic workers tend to use their devices in a manner that distinguishes them from regular users.
