You are one of our very best customers and we appreciate your 
inquiry about WiFi
Internet Connectivity aboard our aircraft.  Please know that we 
carefully tested this product for some time before 
implementation on our 767-200 aircraft.  We would never 
offer any inflight product our service that would be a safety 
issue.
DefCon 17

to continue the relationship we have enjoyed over the years.  
Please be assured we are all working hard to provide the high 
quality service you have every right to expect when

how about the service in 
other countries?

major differences

some details
(and I can always be wrong, remember?)
• user cellphone connects to mini cell 
network in the plane
• voice and data calls get routed to 
satellite* that connects to ground 
stations
gts 12
stations
• crew controlled voicecalls
– being able to switch to silent mode
(thank God
thank God
thank God
thank God!)
• # of simultaneous calls
• uplink speed, depends on the 
technology
