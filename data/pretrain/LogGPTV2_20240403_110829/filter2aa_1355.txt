### Manna From Heaven: Enhancing Wi-Fi Security

#### Introduction
Our goal is to present our research findings on rogue Access Point (AP) attacks, with the intention of improving security, not causing harm. Despite our precautions, there are inherent risks in live demonstrations. Please turn off your Wi-Fi if you do not wish to participate. If you choose to stay connected, you do so at your own risk, and your continued presence will be taken as consent.
