User: Is there a way to get a good call hierarchy in PyDev?
I want to be able to select a function and see in which files it is called and eventually by which other functions. I tried the Hierarchy View in Eclipse by pressing F4, but it does not output what I want.
Assistant: PyDev has a find references with Ctrl+Shift+G (not sure that'd be what you're calling a call hierarchy).
