User: The disk space of the current system is insufficient, how to compress and clear the system log files?
Assistant: You can compress and clean up the system log files through the following steps: 1. Find the system log files: Use the command "ls -lh /var/log/" to view the size of all log files and find the largest files. 2. Compress the log file: Use the command "gzip /var/log/filename.log" to compress the log file into .gz format. 3. Delete the old log file: Use the command "rm /var/log/filename.log" to delete the old log file, but do not delete the log file currently in use. 4. Clear the log file: Use the command "> /var/log/filename.log" to clear the log file, so that the file can be kept, but the file size is 0. 5. Set up log rotation: Use the logrotate tool to set up log rotation so that the system can automatically compress and delete log files. Note: During the log file cleaning process, be careful not to delete the log file currently in use, otherwise it may cause the loss of system log records.
