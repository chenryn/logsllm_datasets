User: How to use a Python script to read data from a CSV file and import the data into a MySQL database?
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script for reading data from a CSV file and importing it into a MySQL database: ``` import csv import MySQLdb # connect to a MySQL database db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", user= "root", passwd="password", db="database_name") # Use the cursor() method to get the operation cursor cursor = db.cursor() # Open the CSV file with open('data.csv', 'r') as csvfile: # Read the CSV file csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile) # Skip the first row (header row) next(csvreader) # Traverse each row in the CSV file for row in csvreader: # Insert each row of data into the MySQL database In cursor.execute("INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", (row[0], row[1], row[2])) # Submit database transaction db.commit() # Close the database connection db.close() ``` You need to replace `data.csv` in the script with the actual file name of the CSV file, and replace the database and table names with the actual database and table names, and replace username and password with your actual MySQL login credentials. Also, adjust the number of columns and parameters in the insert statement based on the actual number of columns in the CSV file. After running the script, the data will be read from the CSV file and inserted into the MySQL database.
