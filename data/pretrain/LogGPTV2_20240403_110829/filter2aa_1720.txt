New Class at CCSF
Hacking is Built into Our Program
Why Teach Hacking?
• Lectures aren't enough
• Students need hands-on labs
• Practice attack and defense
• Hacking is new and exciting
• Even professional network admins don't 
know hacking
Isn't Teaching Hacking Dangerous?
• Criminal hackers don't go to college to 
learn it
• The good guys need to learn it too
• Discussing the issues openly is better than 
forcing students to learn it outside class
Level of Course
• Prerequisites: Network+ and Security+
• No programming
– We don't create exploits
• We just use existing tools, like "script 
kiddies"
• Each project shows vulnerability, attack, 
and defense
The Hacking Lab
• Host systems:
– Windows XP, 1 GB RAM, 2.2 GHz Pentium 4
– 20 GB System drive, 80 GB drive for VMs
• Each student has a folder with three 
VMware virtual machines
– Windows XP
– Windows 2000 Pro
– Ubuntu Linux
Internet Connection
• A single ZyXel router connects the lab to 
the Internet
• Upstream bandwidth throttled to 128 kbps
– To protect the Net from the lab
Warnings
• Each student signed a "Code of Ethics" 
agreement
• Warnings posted in lab and on screens at 
boot-up
Student Assistants
• Student volunteers monitored the lab, and 
had keys
• The lab became a hangout for hackers
• None of the equipment was broken or 
stolen
• Morale was high
Projects: Attacks
• Metasploit
– Taking Over a Windows 2000 box 
from Windows XP
– Taking over a locked Windows 
2000 box from Linux
• Performing a Denial of Service attack on a Web 
Server with Nmap
• Rootkitting Ubuntu Linux (and fixing it) 
• Basic Website hacking with HackThisSite.org
Projects: Finding Vulnerabilities
• Port Scanning with Nmap
• Analyzing Port Scans with Wireshark
• Testing Firewalls 
• NetBIOS Null Sessions 
• Nessus Vulnerability Scanner 
• Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 
(MBSA) 
• Winfingerprint
Projects: Stealing Passwords
• Ettercap
• Software and Hardware Keyloggers
• Ophcrack
• Cain and Abel
• John the Ripper
Projects: Bypassing Passwords
• Ubuntu Linux
– Live CD and mount
– Using recovery mode
• Windows
– Ultimate Boot CD
Results of the Class
• 80 students took the class
• 40 of them passed (a typical success rate)
• No security incidents
• Very high enthusiasm and praise from the 
students
• A lot of interest in more advanced hacking 
classes
Conclusion
• Teach Hacking!
• High rewards, no problems
• BUT:
– CCSF is different from four-year colleges
– Our students are typically working 
professionals
– Students in dormitories may get into more 
mischief
Credits
• Supported by the Institute for 
Convergence of Optical and Network 
Systems (ICONS)
– Funded by NSF
• Encouraged and hosted by the Computer 
Networking and Information 
Technology Department
– Especially Carmen Lamha and Pierre Thiry
