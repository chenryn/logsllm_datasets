User: How to implement data communication between distributed systems? What are the possible communication protocols?
Assistant: Methods for realizing data communication between distributed systems include: 1. Message passing: use message queues or middleware to send messages from one distributed system to another. 2. RPC (Remote Procedure Call): Call a function or procedure on a remote system through the RPC protocol. 3. RESTful API: Use HTTP protocol to realize communication between distributed systems. 4. Socket: Use sockets to realize data communication. Common communication protocols include: 1. TCP/IP: Communication protocols based on the TCP/IP protocol, such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc. 2. AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): It is a protocol for messaging, which defines the format for passing messages between queues, routers, and clients. 3. MQTT (IoT Message Queue Telemetry Transport Protocol): It is a lightweight messaging protocol suitable for communication of IoT applications. 4. gRPC: RPC protocol based on HTTP/2 protocol, supports multiple languages, and has high performance. 5. WebSocket: A TCP-based protocol that establishes a persistent connection for two-way communication.
