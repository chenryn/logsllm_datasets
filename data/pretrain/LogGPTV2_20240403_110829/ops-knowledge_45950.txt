To extract the template from the given log line, you can generalize the specific values. Here is the optimized and more professional version of the template:

**Log Line Template:**
```
Lustre mount FAILED : <hostname> : block_id : location
```

In this template:
- `<hostname>` represents a placeholder for the specific hostname (e.g., `bglio78`).
- `block_id` and `location` are placeholders for the respective values in the log line.
