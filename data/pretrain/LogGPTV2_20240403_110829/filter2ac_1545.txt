**ATT&CK ID:** G0007  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** APT28

APT28, a well-known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been observed downloading additional files through the use of a first-stage downloader. This initial downloader establishes communication with the command and control (C2) server to retrieve and deploy a second-stage implant. [15][16][17][18][19]

This multi-stage approach allows APT28 to maintain a low profile during the initial compromise, while still enabling the delivery of more sophisticated and targeted malware in subsequent stages.
