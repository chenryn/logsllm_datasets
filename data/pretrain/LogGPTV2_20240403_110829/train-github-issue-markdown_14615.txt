### Version
2.6.8
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/wwoxp636jk
### Steps to reproduce
Add a click listener on window in a child component
### What is expected?
Before Vue 2.6, the click event was not propagated to the child component
because it was not created yet.
### What is actually happening?
The click event is now propagated to the child after it is created and
mounted.

Do I need now to explicitly add the modifier `.stop` to all my parent click
events if I add click listeners on window in my child components?
