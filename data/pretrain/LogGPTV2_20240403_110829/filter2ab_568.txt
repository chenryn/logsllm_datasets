**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Domain Fronting

Adversaries may exploit the routing mechanisms of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other similar services to obscure the true destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS. This technique, known as domain fronting, involves using different domain names in the Server Name Indication (SNI) field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are hosted on the same CDN, the CDN will typically route the traffic to the address specified in the HTTP Host field after decrypting the TLS header.

A variant of this technique, called "domainless" fronting, involves leaving the SNI field blank. This approach can be effective even if the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match, as long as the CDN ignores empty SNI fields.
