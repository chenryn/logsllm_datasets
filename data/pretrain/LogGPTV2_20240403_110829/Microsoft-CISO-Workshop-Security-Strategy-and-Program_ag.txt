Next: IT Security Maintenance
Program Maturity Path
Executive sponsorship often required to prioritize 
IT security maintenance (so it won’t be 
continuously overridden by other requirements)Integrated 
& Normalized 
into all 
automation and processes, 
infrastructure as code, etc. 
	Core Priority 
	for IT operations and DevOps teams, continuously increasing technical scope
NIST 800-40 provides 
clear guidance to 
mission/business owners on supporting these efforts
Assets may be at different levels
	Limited Scope / Low Priority 
	Low priority responsibility of IT Operations and DevOps Teams (regularly overridden by other priorities)None / Inconsistent 
	Security patches & configuration not a priority for IT Ops / DevOps teams, only applied on a reactive basis (emergencies)
