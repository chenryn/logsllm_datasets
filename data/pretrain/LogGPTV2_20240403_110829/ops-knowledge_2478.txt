User: Please describe common load balancing algorithms and explain the role of load balancing in application deployment.
Assistant: Common load balancing algorithms include round-robin algorithm, random algorithm, weighted round-robin algorithm, weighted random algorithm, least number of connections algorithm, etc. The polling algorithm specifies that the requests in the server list are forwarded in order, and the random algorithm is to randomly select a server from the server list for forwarding. The weighted round-robin algorithm is to forward requests in order according to the weight in the server list, the weighted random algorithm is to randomly select the server to forward the request according to the weight in the server list, and the least number of connections algorithm is to choose the server with the least number of connections to forward. In application deployment, the function of load balancing is to distribute requests evenly among servers to ensure that the requests processed by each server are relatively balanced, thereby improving the overall availability and stability of the system. Load balancing can reduce the operating load of the system, reduce the burden on the server, improve the efficiency of the server, thereby shortening the response time, improving the scalability and maintainability of the system, so as to better meet the needs of users.
