media dashboard application for managing Twitter accounts in a 
web browser such as Chrome or Firefox. It is popular among desktop 
users and gives you flexibility to manage more than one Twitter 
account using a simple, sleek interface. It also allows you to share an 
account with your team without sharing your password, as you can 
set different access permission on your owned accounts. TweetDeck

 Google+
This is a social networking site owned by Google. It is theoretically considered the 
second largest social media site—after Facebook—in terms of number of registered 
users. (Google has more than 1.2 billion active monthly users of its free Gmail email 
service.)However, we cannot conclude that the same number of users is really using the 
social platform Google+.
The most popular service offered by Google is Gmail, which gives free email service 
to any Google registered user around the globe, with excellent features in terms of 
reliability, availability, and storage space. To use any of Google products (e.g., YouTube, 
Google Drive, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Docs), you need to have a Google account. 
After signing up for a Google account, you can activate a Google+ account with one click. 
The nature of this means that the actual number of Google+ users may be much less 
than the announced statistics. In fact, a study conducted in 2015xi shows that the number 
of active users on Google+ is less than 1 percent of the total Google users. A recent 
statistic conducted in September 4, 2017,xii showed that the total number of unique 
Google+ monthly visits is 34 million, which is far less than its direct rival Facebook.

Google+ offers similar social interactions to Facebook; people can post status 
updates, and these updates can be text only or contain—in addition to text—a photo, 
poll, link (URL), or location. The privacy level of each post can be adjusted according 
to a user’s needs. The Google+ approach to privacy controls is through circles. Contrary 
to Facebook, anyone can add someone to their circle (which is conceptually a list of 
people) without the need for the other person to add the requester back. This approach 
is similar to Twitter; people can follow each other to see their updates, but a follow 
relationship can occur in one direction only (e.g., Nihad can follow Susan, but Susan 
does not have to follow Nihad).
The Google+ default circle names are Friends, Family, and Acquaintances. The user 
can create as many circles as needed and can add other people to them. When posting 
updates to Google+, a user selects which circles they want to share these updates with 
(see Figure 5-26). Please note that circles are private, so other people will not know in 
which circle you have put them.
We will not delve deeply into Google+ as the actual number of active users is 
significantly small. In the next section, we will show some techniques to search for 
people within this platform.

 Searching Google+
Similar to other social networks, Google+ allows its users to have a profile that shows 
some personal information about them. They can adjust the privacy settings of each 
section of the profile. Some Google+ profile information will also appear across all 
Google services. The shared data with other Google services includes the following: 
contact information, education, places (similar to the Facebook check-in feature), links 
(e.g., personal blog or LinkedIn profile), personal information (gender, birthday), skills, 
and personal photos.
To begin your search, start with the search bar located at the top of the page and type 
the person you want to search for. Google+ will give suggestions while you type. The 
returned results—on the next page—will be grouped into four categories: Communities, 
People and Pages, Collections, and Posts (see Figure 5-27).
 Google+ Advanced Search Operator
Like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, Google+ has specialized search operators to help 
you find precise results easily. The following are the most popular ones.
Note! Before using the google+ advanced search operators, you need to know 
how to find a google+ profile id of any user (the username).
 1. log in to your google+ profile.
 2. Click the profile tab on the left side of the screen.
 3. look at the Url in the address bar. the set of characters after  
http://plus.google.com/ is your google id (see Figure 5-28).
Figure 5-27. Searching within Google+ using its built-in search functionality
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
244
 4. to see other users’ google ids, go to each user profile and check the Url in the 
address bar for the target google profile id.
please note that many google+ profiles are still using numbers. however, active 
users have the option to use a customized Url that reflects their real names. 
Fetching google+ ids composed of letters is similar to ones with numbers; you 
need to copy the letters from the Url (beginning at the +sign).
• 
To search for hashtags—similar to Twitter—use the pound (#) 
symbol. Here’s an example: #OSINT.
• 
Use the form operator to search for posts posted by a specific user. 
Here’s an example: from: 106061931199710505959 (replace the 
number with your target Google ID, which can also be composed of 
letters for some accounts).
• 
To search for posts by specific type of content, uses the has search 
operator. Here’s an example: OSINT has:photo (this will return all 
posts containing OSINT that have an image embedded within them). 
The photo part can be replaced with any of the following types: 
attachment, poll, video, doc, slides, spreadsheet.

Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
245
• 
To search for posts before or after a specific date, use the before 
or after operator. The date format should be as follows: YYYY- 
MM- DD. Here’s an example: OSINT before:2017-01-16 | OSINT 
after:2018-01-01.
• 
To find posts commented on by a specific user, use the commenter 
operator followed by the target Google ID. Here’s an example: 
commenter:106061931199710505959.
• 
To find all posts that mention a specific user, use the mention 
operator. Here’s an example: mention: 106061931199710505959.
• 
To search for posts in a specific community or collection, use 
the in operator. Before giving examples on how to search within 
communities/collections, follow these steps to find the community 
or the collection ID on Google+.
 1. 
Log in to your Google+ profile.
 2. 
Go to the target community/collection, check the browser 
address bar, and copy the string of numbers and letters at the 
end of the URL (see Figure 5-29).
• 
To search within Google+ communities, use [Search 
Keyword] in:community (replace the word community with 
the target’s community ID). Here’s an example: pentesting 
in:112627574116901792152 (this will search for the keyword 
pentestingin the target’s community, which has the Google+ ID 
112627574116901792152).

• 
To search within Google+ collections, use [Search keyword] 
in:collection (replace the word collection with the target’s collection 
ID). Here’s an example: hacking in:gAAAZ (this will search for 
hacking within a collection named gAAAZ).
• 
Google+ allows you to use the three logical operators (AND, OR, 
NOT), but you must write them in capital letters. Here’s an example 
for using each one:
• 
Use the NOT operator for negation. Here’s an example: 
from:106061931199710505959 NOT has:photo (this 
will search for all posts sent by the user whose Google ID 
106061931199710505959 and not containing a photo). Please 
note that the NOT operator can be replaced with the minus sign 
(-) (from:106061931199710505959—has:photo).
• 
The AND operator is used to search for multiple search keywords. 
Google+ will automatically add it when separating your search 
keywords with a space, so there is no need to add it manually. 
Here’s an example: from:106061931199710505959 AND 
from:101607398135470979957 (this will search for posts from 
two Google+ accounts).
• 
The OR operator is used to search posts for one or more search 
keywords. Here’s an example: OSINT has:doc OR has:photo OR 
has:spreadsheet (this will search for the keyword OSINT in posts 
that contain doc or photo or spreadsheet within it).
 Using Google to Search Within Google+
The Google search engine can be used effectively to search within Google+. As you 
have done many times before, use the site operator to limit your search to Google+ only 
(site:plus.google.com). Here are some examples:
• 
“PERSON NAME” site:plus.google.com (replace PERSON NAME 
with target name)
• 
“Work at COMPANY NAME” site:plus.google.com (replace 
COMPANY NAME with target company)

Google+ User Feed (http://plusfeed.frosas.net): With this site, 
you can monitor the feeds of Google+ users. It’s useful to monitor 
your target’s posts without visiting their Google+ page.
 LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a social networking service dedicated to professional interactions in the 
business world. Individuals maintain a profile—similar to a résumé—where they present 
their skills, employment history, and work/project achievements, while corporations 
maintain a page to promote their business activities and announce vacancies.
LinkedIn started in 2003, so it is considered among the older social media sites. 
LinkedIn offers its service in 200 countries, and its interface supports 20 languages. 
The majority of LinkedIn users are in the United States; the second largest segment 
comes from India followed by Brazil. In December 2016, Microsoft acquired LinkedIn. 
Currently, LinkedIn has more than 546 million active users worldwide.xiii
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe

To have a LinkedIn profile, you must supply your first and last names, email, and a 
password. LinkedIn has a policy to enforce using real names only; actually it does not 
make sense to have a false profile here as the essence of LinkedIn is to make connections 
in the business world, and you need to offer real information to make useful business 
connections. For privacy-minded people, LinkedIn offers different access permissions 
that allow each user to tailor their profile’s viewable data.
The majority of LinkedIn contents cannot be seen without first logging into your 
LinkedIn account. If you try to see a LinkedIn profile while you are not logged in, you 
will encounter a page asking you to register or sign into your account (see Figure 5-30). 
Some LinkedIn users set high privacy control settings on their accounts to prevent other 
LinkedIn members from viewing parts of their profile—including the profile picture—
unless they become connected on LinkedIn.
Individual profiles on LinkedIn (see Figure 5-31) hold their name, profession, 
education, job history (current and previous employment), featured skills and 
endorsements, recommendations, accomplishments, languages spoken, honors and 
Figure 5-30. A profile view when the requester is not logged into LinkedIn

awards, projects, and interests. People can connect with other professionals on LinkedIn; 
they can also follow other people or corporate pages, and their updates will appear in the 
user timeline feed.
 LinkedIn Search
While you are not logged into LinkedIn, you can perform a simple search for people 
using their first and last names. The search form is located at the bottom of the home 
page (see Figure 5-32).

The result of a LinkedIn search—while you are not logged—is a list of matched 
names with a summary for each one. If you want to access more information about any 
profile, you need to log in to LinkedIn.
For logged-in users, LinkedIn provides a search bar on top of the page to search for 
people, jobs, posts, companies, groups, and schools. Using this search bar, you can begin 
your simple search, and after fetching the results, you can refine your results set using 
LinkedIn advanced filters.
For example, to search for the keyword Apress, type the search keyword Apress in 
the search bar and hit the Enter button. (Note that while typing your search keywords, 
LinkedIn will give search suggestions that appear in the drop-down list as you type.) 
Look at the top of the results page and click All Filters (see Figure 5-33) to filter the 
results according to your needs (see Figure 5-34). Please note that some LinkedIn pages 
may display LinkedIn search filters on the right side of the page.

Warning! Whenever you visit someone’s profile on linkedin, your visit gets 
recorded, and the visited profile will know about it. You can surf linkedin 
anonymously—after changing your privacy setting (profile viewing options), but 
you will in turn lose the ability to know who viewed your profile. please note that 
users with premium linkedin accounts will know who viewed their profile even 
when the visitor uses linkedin in private mode.
LinkedIn advanced search allows you to search according to the target’s first and 
last names, company, school, and title. You can also specify the geographical location of 
the target to limit your search to one area only. The search can be refined to add other 
LinkedIn members who might have a connection with this target. In addition, you can 
filter according to profile language and target current/previous work.

 Advanced LinkedIn Search Operators
Similar to Twitter, LinkedIn allows you to use advanced search operators to refine your 
search. The following are the most popular ones:
• 
To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in quotation marks. The 
same technique can be used to search for profiles that have multiple 
words. Here’s an example: “OSINT intelligence” (this will search for 
the exact phrase enclosed within the quotes).
