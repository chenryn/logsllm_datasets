Sometimes you need to parse and modify URL yourself. There is parse_url
function in PHP. But it returns all components as array. Rebuilding the URL
from the array is a little bit cumbersome because you need lots of checks like
here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4354904/php-parse-url-reverse-parsed-
url#answer-31691249
And there is also some hardcoded logic in UrlGenerator like this  
https://github.com/symfony/Routing/blob/master/Generator/UrlGenerator.php#L58
So it's hard to build it the same way UrlGenerator does it. OFC one can use
the generator for it but it's not usable for URLs which are not routed.
I think it would be nice to move this logic to a new value object so one can
use it for creating/modifying URLs. Like this  
https://github.com/nette/http/blob/master/src/Http/Url.php  
Not only UrlGenerator could use it. For example RedirectResponse is another
candidate which could return it instead of a string so one can just for
example safely append query parameter to it. I was solving this issue in my
custom authentication failure handler which overrides the default symfony one
and appends query parameter to the RedirectResponse.
What do you think?
EDIT: Or if it was too big change then at least moving the hardcoded logic
from urlgenerator would also be useful. Maybe even just an utility class...
