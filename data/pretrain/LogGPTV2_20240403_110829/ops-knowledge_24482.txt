When attempting to install the `python-mysql` package today, I encountered several compilation errors, all of which reported that the `/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk` could not be found. Here is an example of the error messages:

```
running build
running build_py
copying MySQLdb/release.py -> build/lib.macosx-10.3-i386-2.6/MySQLdb
  running build_ext
building '_mysql' extension
Compiling with an SDK that doesn't seem to exist: /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
Please check your Xcode installation
```

I have already installed the latest version of Xcode (4.0), which includes the most recent GCC and SDK. I attempted to locate where `10.4u.sdk` was specified but could not find any references in the system environment, program source, or setuptools source.

Additionally, I tried setting the following environment variables, but this did not resolve the issue:

```bash
export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
export SDKROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
```

Could anyone provide guidance on where this SDK might be specified in Mac OS X Snow Leopard?

**Response:**

To address this issue, you should first check your environment for the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` variables. Both of these can include the `-isysroot` argument, which influences the SDK selection. You can inspect these by running:

```bash
echo $CFLAGS
echo $LDFLAGS
```

Another useful step is to examine the output of `python2.6-config --cflags --ldflags`, as this can influence the Makefile generation. For example:

```bash
python2.6-config --cflags --ldflags
```

Finally, try running `easy_install` with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed information about the build process:

```bash
easy_install --verbose python-mysql
```

This additional information may help identify the root cause of the problem.
