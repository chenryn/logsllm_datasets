User: when I try to install python-mysql today, I got a number of compilation error or complaining /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk not found, like the following:

running build
running build_py
copying MySQLdb/release.py -> build/lib.macosx-10.3-i386-2.6/MySQLdb
  running build_ext
building '_mysql' extension
Compiling with an SDK that doesn't seem to exist: /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
Please check your Xcode installation

However, I already installed latest xcode 4.0, which does include latest GCC and SDK.
I tried to find out where the 10.4u.sdk is specified, but could not find it in the system environment, program source and setuptools source.
I tried to export 

export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
export SDKROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk

but still has no luck.
so anyone has any idea where this is specified in Mac Snow Leopard pls?
thx
Assistant: Check your environment for CFLAGS or LDFLAGS.  Both of these can include the -isysroot argument that influences the SDK selection.  The other place to start at is to look at the output of python2.6-config --cflags --ldflags since (I believe) that this influences the Makefile generation.  Make sure to run easy_install with --verbose and see if it yields any additional insight.
