### Issue: Resolving C++ Include Errors for OpenCV 4 on Linux

#### Problem Description
When building OpenCV 4 (version 4.x.x) from source on Linux, the include files are moved to `/usr/local/include/opencv4/opencv2/...`. This causes compilation errors in many OpenCV modules that include headers using the old path.

#### Solution
1. **Manual Fix:**
   - Move the `opencv2` directory to the root of `/usr/local/include/` and remove the `opencv4` directory.
   ```sh
   mv /usr/local/include/opencv4/opencv2 /usr/local/include/.
   rm -rf /usr/local/include/opencv4
   ```

2. **Alternative: Modify Makefile**
   - If you prefer not to move the files, you can modify the `Makefile` to use the correct include paths. This is more complex and may require significant changes.

#### Additional Issue: Compiling a Simple OpenCV Project

**Problem:**
After resolving the include errors, you may encounter issues when compiling a simple OpenCV project that reads and displays an image.

**Solution:**
Create an `opencv.pc` file to be read by `pkg-config` in Linux. This file will provide the necessary package information for your OpenCV installation.

```sh
cat > /usr/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc << EOF
# Package Information for pkg-config
prefix=/usr
exec_prefix=${prefix}/local
libdir=${prefix}/lib
includedir=${exec_prefix}/include/opencv2
