 **HEAD** : I rewrite my issue for people who search for c++ include error
solution.
Opencv4 (version 4.x.x) (building from source for linux) move include files in
/usr/local/include/ **opencv4/opencv2** /...  
The problem is lot of opencv modules are including ** which
make error while compiling.  
Yes, I know that is very difficult to change all includes in modules, but you
can change it in the Makefile.
Of course, this is just a recommendation for your project, for me, I resolved
the problem by executing this commands:
    mv /usr/local/include/opencv4/opencv2 /usr/local/include/.
    rm -rf /usr/local/include/opencv4
Thanks Developers ðŸ¥‡ !
**EDIT** : I found a new problem while compiling a simple opencv project which
read image and display it. And I found a resolution for this error:
    # I make an opencv.pc file which it can be read by pkg-config in linux
    cat > /usr/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc << EOF
    # Package Information for pkg-config

I made a full automation script shell in my repo. Check it later if you like.
