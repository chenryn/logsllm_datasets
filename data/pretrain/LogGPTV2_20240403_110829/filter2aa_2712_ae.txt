### Managing Windows Computers in a Workgroup

#### Changing the Name or Description of a Computer
If you need to modify the name or description of a computer listed under the Windows Computers account, use the Workgroup Manager to first remove the computer and then re-add it with the updated information.

#### Moving a Windows Computer to a Different Account
It is not possible to move a Windows computer from the Windows Computers account to another account. Windows computers must remain part of the Windows Computers account and cannot belong to more than one account.

#### Deleting the Windows Computers Account
The Windows Computers account cannot be deleted.

### Chapter 3: Administering Windows Users, Groups, Computers, and Share Points

#### Managing SMB Share Points
Share points for Windows home directories and roaming user profiles are automatically configured on a Mac OS X Server primary domain controller (PDC). However, you can set up additional share points. Windows uses the server message block (SMB) protocol to access these share points.

- **Default Share Point for Home Directories**: The default share point for Windows home directories is the same as that for Mac OS X home directories.
- **Default Share Point for User Profiles**: The default share point for user profiles is the `/Users/Profiles/` folder on the PDC server. This SMB share point is not visible in Workgroup Manager.
- **Setting Up Alternate SMB Share Points**: You can configure alternate SMB share points for home directories and user profiles on the PDC server or on domain member servers.
- **Exclusive and Nonexclusive Use**: You can create share points for exclusive or nonexclusive use by Windows users. For example, you can set up a share point for shared graphics or word processing files that can be used on both Windows and Mac OS platforms, or a share point for SMB access only, which is accessible only to Windows users.

For an overview of share points and considerations before creating them, refer to the share points chapter in the file services administration guide.

#### Opportunistic Locking (Oplocks)
SMB share points in Mac OS X Server support opportunistic locking, which improves performance by allowing clients to cache changes locally while maintaining exclusive access to the file.

- **File Locking**: File locking prevents multiple clients from modifying the same information simultaneously. A client locks the file or part of the file to gain exclusive access.
- **Enabling Oplocks**: To enable oplocks, use Workgroup Manager to change the Windows protocol settings for a share point.
- **Important Note**: Do not enable oplocks for a share point that uses any protocol other than SMB.

#### Strict Locking
Strict locking, enabled by default, helps prevent poorly written applications from corrupting files by ensuring the SMB server checks and enforces file locks.

### Creating an SMB Share Point and Setting Privileges

1. **Open Workgroup Manager** and select the Sharing module.
2. **Select the Item to Share**: Click All and choose the item you want to share.
3. **Configure General Settings**:
   - Select “Share this item and its contents.”
   - Change the owner or group of the shared item if needed. Type names or drag names from the Users & Groups drawer.
4. **Set Access Privileges**:
   - Use the pop-up menus to change the privileges for the Owner, Group, and Everyone.
   - Optionally, apply the ownership and privileges of the share point to all files and folders it contains by clicking Copy.
5. **Configure Protocols**:
   - Click Protocols and choose Windows File Settings.
   - Select “Share this item using SMB” to provide SMB access.
   - Select “Allow SMB guest access” to allow unregistered users access (for greater security, do not select this option).
   - Enter a custom SMB name if you want to change the name clients see when they browse for and connect to the share point.
   - Enable oplocks or strict locking as needed.
6. **Assign Default Access Privileges**:
   - Choose whether new items should inherit permissions from the parent or assign specific privileges.
7. **Save Changes**.

#### From the Command Line
You can also set up a share point using the `sharing` command in Terminal. For more information, refer to the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Changing Windows (SMB) Settings for a Share Point

To modify the settings of an existing SMB share point:

1. **Open Workgroup Manager** and select the Sharing module.
2. **Select the Share Point** and click Protocols.
3. **Choose Windows File Settings** and make the necessary changes.
4. **Save Changes**.

From the Command Line
You can also change a share point’s SMB settings using the `sharing` command in Terminal. For more information, refer to the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Managing Share Points
For day-to-day tasks related to managing share points, such as disabling a share point, disabling a protocol, viewing share points, copying privileges, and more, refer to the share points chapter in the file services administration guide.

### Migrating Users from a Windows Server to Mac OS X Server

#### Step 1: Set up Mac OS X Server
Follow the instructions in the getting started guide:
1. Install server software.
2. Perform initial server setup, creating an Open Directory master domain and a Windows primary domain controller (PDC) on the server.

#### Step 2: Set up the Home Directory Infrastructure
1. Identify a location for home directories, either using a predefined share point or setting up your own.
2. Configure the share point to mount automatically on client workstations.
3. Set up default file access permissions for Windows users.

#### Step 3: Export Users from the Windows Server Domain
1. Open the user management application on your Windows server.
2. Export users into a tab-delimited file.

#### Step 4: Import Users on Mac OS X Server
1. Ensure Windows services are running.
2. Map a network drive to Mac OS X Server.
3. Log in as the administrator and copy the export file.
4. Modify the export file and import users using Workgroup Manager.

#### Step 5: Transfer Login Scripts to Mac OS X Server
1. Copy login scripts from the Windows server to `/etc/netlogon/` on Mac OS X Server.
2. Update the login script paths in Workgroup Manager.

#### Step 6: Join Windows Clients to Mac OS X Server PDC
On each Windows workstation, join the Windows PDC domain on the server to enable Open Directory authentication.

#### Step 7: Transfer Client Files and Settings to Mac OS X Server Home Directories
1. Map a network drive to Mac OS X Server and log in as an imported user.
2. Map a network drive to the Windows server and copy files to the Mac OS X Server home directory.

### Managing Windows Services

#### Starting and Stopping Windows Services
- **Starting Services**: Use Server Admin to start Windows services.
- **Stopping Services**: Use Server Admin to stop Windows services. Note that stopping services may cause connected users to lose unsaved data.

#### From the Command Line
You can also manage Windows services using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, refer to the file services chapter of the command-line administration guide.
