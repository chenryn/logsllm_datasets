User: Once my program has been launched, it opens any number of ssh sessions (user defined) and runs specific commands on the servers indefinitely (while true loop) or until the user quits. For efficiency reasons I want to create each session only once, then be able to run the commands until the user quits.
How can I do this in python? I ran across a cool method in another post which used subprocess to run a command and capture its STDOUT. How can I first initiate the session, then run looped commands?
Any links to process-like stuff in Python would also be appreciated. This is my first python application.
Assistant: Tried mixing it up with multithreading?
