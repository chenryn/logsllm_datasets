It seems that there is an issue with the displayed text in the editor loading
a duplicate line that also forces the cursors initial location to be above
where it actually is applying the keystrokes. This only happens the first time
I select something then both the duplicate code and the cursor function
normally.
#### Screenshot
On load the 3rd row is duplicated, it disappears when it refreshes the preview
