User: I am currently working on a project that involves the google apps provisioning api.
Without getting too detailed about the purpose or inner workings of the project, I would like to ask a very simple question:
Is there a way to programmatically create a google apps for business domain (especially as a reseller)?
After tooling around the provisioning api for a while all i could find are ways to add and remove users but nothing pertaining to whole domains.
Assistant: There is an API only available to Google Apps Resellers, if you are one of them you should get access to it.
