# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18363.836
    PowerToys version: 0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable):Fancy Zones
Not sure if this specific issue is already mentioned, but just to be sure it
is...
# Steps to reproduce
I have two screens, using two different grids. For argument's sake let's call
them monitor 1 and 2, and grid 1 and 2.  
In the Windows Settings i changed the Primary Display from 1 to 2 (or the
other way around). _As it turns out, it's more about expanding desktops_
# Expected behavior
Either no change of position (= fixed to display device) OR to have them
swapped around (= fixed to primary/secondary screen)
# Actual behavior
After the swap (edit: expansion and/or swaping), both grids appear on the same
monitor.  
When i swap the priority back, both grids appear on their original screen.
