We demonstrated that the PCA-subspace method can be
easily compromised (often dramatically) under all of these
poisoning scenarios. From the attacker’s point of view, we
illustrate that simple strategies can be eﬀective and conclude
that it is not worth the risk or extra amount of work for the
attacker to engage in attempts at optimal strategies. We
demonstrated that our antidote solution is robust to all of
these attacks in that it does not allow poisoning attacks to
shift the false positive and false negative rates in any signif-
icant way. We showed that antidote provides robustness
for nearly all the ingress POP to egress POP ﬂows in a back-
bone network, rejects much of the contaminated data, and
continues to operate as a DoS defense even in the face of
poisoning.
In the future, we plan to adapt our scheme to defend
against poisoning strategies that enable DDoS evasion, and

intend to validate our ﬁndings on other traﬃc matrix datasets
(e.g., G´EANT or enterprise networks). It is also interesting
to consider using robust statistical methods for other detec-
tors such as general anomography [33] techniques. We plan
to go beyond rejection of poisoning data, and study methods
for identifying the responsible ﬂow for a poisoning attack by
looking at correlations among links that are rejecting chaﬀ.
