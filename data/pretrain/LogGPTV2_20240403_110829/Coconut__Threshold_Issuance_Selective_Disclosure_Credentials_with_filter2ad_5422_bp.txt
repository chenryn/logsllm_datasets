When it comes to efficiency and the issuance of general-purpose selective disclosure credentials, maintaining desirable distributed trust assumptions is crucial. However, existing solutions often fail to meet these requirements, limiting their applicability in distributed settings such as blockchain networks. This also hinders security engineers from implementing effective separation of duty policies, which are essential for preserving system integrity.

In this paper, we introduce Coconut, a novel scheme that addresses these challenges. Coconut supports distributed threshold issuance, public and private attributes, re-randomization, and multiple unlinkable selective attribute revelations. We provide an overview of the Coconut system and the cryptographic primitives that underpin it. Additionally, we present an implementation and evaluation of Coconut as a smart contract library on both Chainspace, a sharded blockchain, and Ethereum, a permissionless blockchain. We also demonstrate three diverse and important applications: anonymous payments, petitions, and censorship resistance.

Coconut fills a significant gap in the literature by enabling the efficient use of general-purpose selective disclosure credentials, an important privacy-enhancing technology, in environments where there is no natural single trusted third party to issue them. It also facilitates interoperability with modern transparent computation platforms.
