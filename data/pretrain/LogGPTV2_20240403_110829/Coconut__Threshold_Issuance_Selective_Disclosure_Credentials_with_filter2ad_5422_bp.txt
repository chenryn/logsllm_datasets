it comes to efﬁciency and issuing general purpose selective
disclosure credentials without sacriﬁcing desirable distributed
trust assumptions. This limits their applicability in distributed
settings such as distributed ledgers, and prevents security
engineers from implementing separation of duty policies that
are effective in preserving integrity. In this paper, we present
Coconut—a novel scheme that supports distributed threshold
issuance, public and private attributes, re-randomization, and
multiple unlinkable selective attribute revelations. We provide
an overview of the Coconut system, and the cryptographic
primitives underlying Coconut; an implementation and eval-
uation of Coconut as a smart contract library in Chainspace
and Ethereum, a sharded and a permissionless blockchain
respectively; and three diverse and important application to
anonymous payments, petitions and censorship resistance. Co-
conut ﬁlls an important gap in the literature and enables general
purpose selective disclosure credentials—an important privacy
enhancing technology—to be efﬁciently used in settings with
no natural single trusted third party to issue them, and to
interoperate with modern transparent computation platforms.
