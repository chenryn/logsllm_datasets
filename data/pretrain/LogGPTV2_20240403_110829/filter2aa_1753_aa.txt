Preface 
1984 
Have you ever embellished a resume, or lied when you told a hot date that you were in love with 
her?  Guess what: you have engaged in Information Warfare.  And governments are just like you 
and me … only the stakes are usually much higher. 
In the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell imagined a government that waged full-time 
Information Warfare against its own people.  There is a Ministry of Truth, which is in charge of 
lies.  Thought Police punished something called thoughtcrime, and used technology in the form of 
two-way telescreens to keep an eye on everyone.  Room 101, a torture chamber in the Ministry of 
Love, awaits those who dare to challenge the system.  There, Big Brother tries to reprogram 
wayward souls.  Citizen Winston Smith worked in the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history in an 
attempt to match current government positions. 
Truth is always stranger than fiction: there are in fact many countries on Earth today where the 
only media available carry stories that are carefully crafted by government censors, and where 
the government's point of view will invariably be the right one, no matter how many times it 
changes.  At one point in 1984, citizens are told that their country, Oceania, had always been at 
war with its theretofore ally, Eastasia.  Life paused for a moment, as everyone absorbed the new 
reality, and then it returned to normal. 
2007 
Fast-forward to DEFCON 15.  The indisputable power of the Internet is growing by the day.  
Students, politicians, covert operatives and televangelists all agree.  To military men, the Internet 
is also a weapon; in a soldier's parlance, it can now kill people and break things.  Privacy 
advocates, law enforcement, and freedom of information warriors are all working on enormously 
important Internet projects, even if they are doing so for quite different purposes. 
In times past, the first thing a coup plotter had to do, just before dawn, was to seize the national 
radio station.  Printing presses – since they operate so much slower than radio waves – could wait 
until the afternoon.  The Internet has changed the rules of the game.  Anyone who owns a 
personal computer and a connection to the Internet has both a printing press and a radio 
transmitter in their own home, and the entire world is potentially their audience.  In places where 
there has traditionally been only government-run radio and newspaper, the Internet is not only 
the final frontier in the information space, but it can also represent a grave threat to the 
continued power of a ruling government…

Palace Strategy 
Rule #1: Never trust the Internet.  It is dynamic, chaotic, and 
inherently unpredictable.  The people will likely use access to the 
Internet to try and bring your government down.  At the Cyber Office, 
our job will be to pare the Internet down to a manageable size. 
Always remember that no matter what activist groups may say, there are 
good reasons to filter Internet content.  There is evil among us, and 
it must be policed.  Publicly, you can cite culture, religion, and 
common sense.  The two-edged sword here is that Law Enforcement tools 
can be used against both common criminals and political adversaries. 
From a political point of view, the Internet is the best way to 
deliver political messages efficiently and directly to the people.  At 
the same time, software tools allow us the opportunity to deny your 
rivals that same opportunity.  To maximize our leverage, we must 
ensure that all telecommunications are controlled by the state.  If we 
can do that, surveillance and even information manipulation are only a 
mouse click away. 
One final point.  Cyber attacks are extremely hard to prove.  
Evidence, especially for the common man, is scarce.  If a reporter 
asks, tell them that you do not even own a computer.  Other 
governments may occasionally ask you a question about computers, but 
in reality they rarely let human rights interfere with their business 
interests. 
Cyber Office Tactics 
The Internet itself is a Trojan horse.  Now that it is allowed in our 
country, there will be surprises.  Modern data-hiding techniques mean 
that even your official portrait, on our national homepage, could 
carry a secret message within it that describes the details of a 
planned coup d-etat, and we would not know it.  Computer networks will 
never be air-tight.  Hostile network operations are inevitable from 
both internal users and from the farthest corners of the planet. 
If you continue to allow the Internet into this country, we are going 
to need better equipment and more expertise.  Some of the choices we 
need to make for the country are the exact same choices that are faced 
by home computer users: do we buy shrink-wrapped software or use 
freeware?  Do we want it highly configurable or point-and-click?  
Reportedly, Burma, Belarus, Zimbabwe and Cuba have all purchased 
Internet surveillance systems from the People's Republic of China 
(PRC). 
Most of the traditional security skills that we have hired in the past 
are simply inadequate to control cyberspace.  New recruits must either 
possess or quickly acquire cyber expertise. 
The first thing we will target is unchecked network connections.  Here 
are the new rules: 
• 
All Internet accounts must be officially registered with state 
officials 
• 
All Internet activity must be directly attributable to individual 
accounts 
• 
Users may not share or sell their connections 
• 
Users may not encrypt their communications 
• 
We will encourage self-censorship through physical and virtual 
intimidation 
• 
We will manage access to international news sites, especially in 
English  
• 
We will regulate and tax local language sites to a very high 
degree 
In 1991, I crossed the border from Tanzania to Malawi.  My bags were 
searched, and all foreign media was confiscated.  If you really want 
to own your information space, this type of discipline is necessary.  
World history must be your history, and the future must be your 
future. 
Finally, we are in touch with several regimes that have common cyber 
concerns.  They have signaled that they are willing to share their 
work with us on tactics and lessons learned. 
National Security and Traffic Analysis 
In theory, it is possible to read, delete, and/or modify information 
“packets” based on both address and content.  When our network 
administrators discover a violation of the law, they simply call the 
police, and after cross-checking telecommunications records, they 
knock on the perpetrator’s door. 
The two basic information-filtering strategies you should be aware of 
are blacklisting and whitelisting.  Blacklisting means removing from 
the public domain any material content that is objectively wrong, such 
as the words “government” and “corrupt” appearing in the same 
sentence.  The problem with blacklisting is that someone will find a 
way to fool the system – wittingly or unwittingly – by writing 
something like “our govrment is korrupt”.  Therefore, whitelisting is 
a more attractive way to control the information flow.  The premise 
here is that absolutely nothing is allowed, except that which has been 
pre-approved by the state.  We can give the people just enough 
politics, weather, sport, and porn, and we are done. 
Freedom loves pornography.  In fact, there are interesting 
relationships here for us to exploit.  Some countries believe that 
pornography is absolutely wrong and must be prohibited at all cost.  
And they are quite open about this.  That gives governments like ours 
legitimacy in censorship.  In practice, pornography is possible to 
censor because sex words make great computer keywords.  They are 
conveniently marked “vulgar” in the dictionary.  Our intention, 
however, is not to block porn per se, but to give our citizens just 
enough to keep them happy. 
Politics are far more difficult for computers to analyze, so there is 
no choice for the Cyber Office but to be ruthless.  The challenge for 
computers is completely different, as word recognition is not enough.  
Artificial intelligence is not smart enough to place the words it sees 
into context.  Computers do not understand the nuances of politics.  
The author's intention may have been positive feedback, constructive 
criticism, humor, irony, sarcasm, or satire.  Most humans don’t even 
know the difference.  Political censorship requires an army of subject 
matter experts fluent in the local history, language, and culture.  
This was difficult in ancient Egypt; in the Internet era, it is 
impossible. 
In the future, you will surely face the so-called Despot's Challenge, 
which refers to the problem of both over- and under-censoring 
citizens’ lives.  In general, any censorship at all usually leads to 
over-censorship.  In censored countries, for example, citizens cannot 
usually find a map of Middlesex County, and they have trouble finding 
a recipe for marinated chicken breasts.  Censored items should ideally 
be double-checked by real people.  Unfortunately, that is not always 
practical.  What we know for sure is that giving the people too much 
information is always dangerous.  However, if they have too little 
information to work with, they may become quickly bored and restless. 
The Corporate Connection 
Strict government control and network packet analysis are not a match 
made in heaven.  Traditional methods of control, such as muscles and 
truncheons, are of little use in cyberspace.  Fortunately, there are 
many software companies that make products we can buy off-the-shelf: 
8e6, CensorNet, Content Keeper, Cyber Patrol, Cyber Sentinel,
