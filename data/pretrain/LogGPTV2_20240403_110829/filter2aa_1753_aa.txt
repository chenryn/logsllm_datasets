**Preface**

**1984**

Have you ever embellished a resume or told a romantic interest that you were in love with her, even if it wasn't entirely true? If so, you have engaged in a form of information warfare. Governments, like individuals, often manipulate information, but the stakes are much higher.

In George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, the government wages a relentless campaign of information warfare against its own people. The Ministry of Truth, which is responsible for propaganda, controls the narrative. Thought Police punish thoughtcrime, using advanced technology such as two-way telescreens to monitor citizens. Room 101, a torture chamber in the Ministry of Love, is reserved for those who challenge the system. Winston Smith, a citizen, works in the Ministry of Truth, rewriting history to align with the government's current positions.

Reality can be stranger than fiction. In many countries today, the only media available are those carefully controlled by government censors, ensuring that the government's perspective is always presented as the correct one, regardless of how often it changes. In *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, citizens are suddenly informed that their country, Oceania, has always been at war with Eastasia, a former ally. Life briefly pauses as everyone absorbs this new reality before returning to normal.

**2007**

Fast-forward to DEFCON 15. The Internet's power is growing exponentially, influencing students, politicians, covert operatives, and televangelists alike. For military personnel, the Internet is also a weapon, capable of causing harm and disruption. Privacy advocates, law enforcement, and freedom of information activists are all working on critical Internet projects, though their goals may differ.

In the past, a coup plotter's first move was to seize the national radio station, followed by the printing presses. The Internet has changed these dynamics. Anyone with a personal computer and an Internet connection now has the equivalent of a printing press and a radio transmitter, with a global audience. In regions where only government-controlled media existed, the Internet represents both the final frontier of information and a significant threat to the ruling government's power.

**Top Secret**

**Chief of Station Intelligence Report**

**Palace Strategy**

Rule #1: Never trust the Internet. It is dynamic, chaotic, and inherently unpredictable. The public will likely use it to challenge your government. Our role at the Cyber Office is to make the Internet manageable. Remember, there are valid reasons to filter content, such as combating evil and maintaining order. Publicly, you can cite culture, religion, and common sense. Law enforcement tools can be used against both criminals and political adversaries.

Politically, the Internet is the best way to deliver messages directly to the people. Software tools allow us to deny our rivals the same opportunity. To maximize our control, all telecommunications must be state-owned. This ensures surveillance and information manipulation are just a click away.

Cyber attacks are difficult to prove, and evidence is scarce. If asked, claim you do not own a computer. Other governments rarely let human rights interfere with business interests.

**Cyber Office Tactics**

The Internet is a Trojan horse. Once allowed, surprises will follow. Modern data-hiding techniques mean that even an official portrait on a national homepage could contain secret messages about a planned coup. Computer networks will never be completely secure, and hostile operations are inevitable.

If the Internet remains, we need better equipment and expertise. We face the same choices as home users: should we use commercial software or freeware? Should it be highly configurable or user-friendly? Countries like Burma, Belarus, Zimbabwe, and Cuba have purchased Internet surveillance systems from China.

Traditional security skills are inadequate for cyberspace. New recruits must have or quickly acquire cyber expertise.

Our first targets are unchecked network connections. New rules include:
- All Internet accounts must be registered with state officials.
- All activity must be traceable to individual accounts.
- Users may not share or sell their connections.
- Encryption is prohibited.
- Self-censorship will be encouraged through intimidation.
- Access to international news sites, especially in English, will be managed.
- Local language sites will be heavily regulated and taxed.

In 1991, I crossed from Tanzania to Malawi, where all foreign media was confiscated. To control the information space, similar discipline is necessary. World history must align with your history, and the future must be yours.

We are in contact with other regimes sharing cyber concerns, and they are willing to share tactics and lessons learned.

**National Security and Traffic Analysis**

In theory, it is possible to read, delete, or modify information packets based on address and content. When violations are detected, network administrators call the police, who cross-check records and apprehend the perpetrator.

Two basic filtering strategies are blacklisting and whitelisting. Blacklisting removes content deemed objectively wrong, such as "government" and "corrupt" in the same sentence. However, blacklisting can be bypassed by altering spellings. Whitelisting, which allows only pre-approved content, is more effective. We can provide the people with enough politics, weather, sports, and pornography to keep them satisfied.

Pornography is easier to censor due to identifiable keywords. Our goal is not to block it entirely but to provide enough to keep the population happy. Political content is more challenging, requiring subject matter experts fluent in local history, language, and culture. Artificial intelligence is not yet sophisticated enough to understand nuances like humor, irony, or satire.

The Despot's Challenge involves the risk of over- or under-censoring. Over-censorship can lead to absurd restrictions, while under-censorship can cause boredom and restlessness. Censored items should ideally be double-checked, but this is not always practical. Giving too much information is dangerous, but too little can lead to unrest.

**The Corporate Connection**

Strict government control and network packet analysis are not naturally compatible. Traditional methods of control, such as physical force, are ineffective in cyberspace. Fortunately, many software companies offer off-the-shelf solutions, including 8e6, CensorNet, Content Keeper, Cyber Patrol, and Cyber Sentinel.
