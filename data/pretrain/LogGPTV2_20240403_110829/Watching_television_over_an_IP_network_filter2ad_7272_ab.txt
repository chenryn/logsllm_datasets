4.1 High-level viewing characteristics
We present our ﬁndings on viewing characteristics.
4.1.1 Number of simultaneous online users
We examine the number of concurrent online users based
on our notion of users on- and oﬀ-line. Figure 3 shows the
day-of-week trend over a representative trace period. The
start of each day is marked in the horizontal axis. The num-
ber of viewers in Figure 3 shows some interesting patterns.
First, the graph shows a diurnal pattern with two large
peaks around 3PM and 10PM, and a small peak around
8AM. They correspond to dining hours of the population.
Other video systems showed similar diurnal patterns with
two peaks [16, 17]. We will shortly examine how these on-
line users are distributed across individual channels.
4.1.2 Session characteristics
An average household watches 2.54 hours and 6.3 distinct
channels of TV a day. The average length of time users
watch TV each online session is 1.2 hours, and each on-
line session consists of multiple surﬁng and viewing events.
According to the traditional survey results reported by
Nielsen [20], an average household watches television for ap-
proximately 8 hours and 14 minutes per day and an individ-
ual watched 4 hours and 34 minutes a day. Other surveys re-
port that an average household in Australia watches 3 hours
of TV a day [21] and an average person in UK watches TV
for 3 hours and 38 minutes a day [22].
Across a day, the median and the mean channel holding
times are 8 seconds and 14.8 minutes, indicating that a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of user activities are short-intervaled (i.e.,
surﬁng) while some last much longer (i.e., away) as we saw in
Figure 2. The median and the mean channel holding times
are 6 and 10 seconds when surﬁng, 4.8 minutes and 10.7
minutes for viewing activities, and 3.1 hours and 5.7 hours
when away, respectively.
Investigating the session durations more closely, we exam-
ine the times spent on watching television before changing
a channel (i.e., sojourn times). Using a representative day
trace, we show the frequency of sojourn times of all online
users in Figure 4, in a log-log scale. The frequency of a TV
watching duration increases from 1 to 4 seconds, then drops
very quickly. Most channel changes happen 4 seconds af-
ter the previous channel change action. The increase in the
frequency from 1 to 4 seconds may be aﬀected by multiple
issues. For example, the eﬀective channel switching time (or
so-called the zapping time) may vary per household depend-
ing on the distance of the set-top-box to the local DSLAM.
Also, individuals vary in the ability to quickly recognize a
program. However, the exact impact of these issues needs
further investigation.

Figure 3: Number of viewers over a week period
Unlike patterns of Internet usage [18], Friday and Satur-
day consistently had the lowest evening peaks within the
week. On weekends, the number of viewers ramps up from
early morning, which was due to the increase in viewing of
children’s programs. Further details reveal that on week-
ends the number of distinct viewers increase by 5% and the
total time spent on TV increases by 30%. Such a trend has
been also reported in a survey of the UK workers about their
leisure time use [19].

Duration of TV watching
Figure 4: Duration of time watching each channel
The graph after the 4-second mark follows a power-law
distribution [23, 24]. This reﬂects an interesting tendency of
users to continue watching the same channel: the probabil-
ity of continuing to watch a channel increases proportionally
with the length of time already spent watching that channel.
This is in contrast to the exponential distribution, which has
generally represented human activity in environments, such
as wireless access [25] and telephone call [26] durations, and
reﬂects the memoryless property that future activity is in-
dependent of past activity. According to Vazqueza [27], the
power-law pattern in humans could be due to people having
some perception of their past activity rate (i.e., not memory-

4.1.3 Attention span
When watching television, people browse through a set of
on-air TV programs until they ﬁnd something interesting.
The behavior of channel selection involves the following two
steps: (a) browsing content to decide whether to continue or
stop streaming and (b) switching through multiple channels
for repeated browsing, until a desired channel is found. In
Figure 2, we observed that over 60% of user action is related
to channel surﬁng. To understand in detail how long a sin-
gle sample takes, we summarize the characteristic channel
holding times for a few channel genres in Table 1.3
The 50th percentile values range from 6 to 11 seconds, in-
dicating that viewers watched only for a very short while and
changed the channel. The median duration is slightly longer
for free, mixed, docu, and cine. The 90 and 95th percentile
values reﬂect the viewing durations and show larger varia-
tions ranging from 3 to 21 minutes. At the 90th and above
percentiles, the viewing durations of music and sports are
much shorter than those of kids, free, mixed, and cine—or
conversely, the attention span is much shorter when watch-
ing music or sports.
4.1.4 Time spent on each genre
We now investigate the fraction of time user spent on these
genres. Table 2 summarizes the percentage of time spent on
each genre, over the trace period. free and mixed genres ac-
count for over 50% of TV viewing instances. [30] reports that
these genres (identiﬁed as news and public aﬀaires, comedy,
and drama in the report) similarly account for over 60% of
TV viewing in Canada. Regional content is also popular,
considering that each region has one or two local channels.
Kids and docu programs are also popular. There are signif-
icant diﬀerences in our ﬁndings of channel genre popularity
and those reported by sampling statistics for the US popula-
tion [31]. For instance, [31] reports kids and docu channels
to almost double the percentage in viewing share we ﬁnd in
our analysis. While this could well be a trend in diﬀerent
social behaviors in the analyzed populations, it could also be

lations watching individual channels or how diﬀerent popu-
lations exhibit diﬀerent social behavior.
attributed to a change in viewing behavior when households
are under the scrutiny of a tracking device.
4.2 Channel popularity and dynamics
The current IPTV system continuously sends out multicast
streams of all channels throughout the destinations in the
backbone (i.e., DSLAMs). However, such ﬁxed distribution
may no longer be possible if and when the number of chan-
nels increases.
In certain cases, the backbone needs more
bandwidth to deliver channels in multicast rather than in
unicast. One strategy to minimize the network cost in the
backbone is to use multicast for some channels, while car-
rying the rest as unicast (or P2P distributed fashion [32]).
Accurate measurement of channel popularity is critical in de-
signing such systems. In this section, we study channel pop-
ularity from three diﬀerent angles. First we analyze its dis-
tribution to understand how user interests are spread across
channels. We then investigate how fast channel popularity
changes over time, and what causes such dynamics.
4.2.1 Popularity distribution
We start with channel popularity distribution. Figure 5(a)
shows the aggregate fraction of viewers accounting to the
least x-th popular channels. The horizontal axis represents
the ranking of channels normalized between 0 and 100, from
the most popular to the least popular. The top 10% of chan-
nels account for nearly 80% of viewers, which reﬂects the
Pareto principal or 80-20 rule. This is consistent across dif-
ferent times of the day. It is important to note that our no-
tion of channel popularity is from the system’s perspective,
not from the individual user’s. The audience base changes
over the course of a day, i.e., diﬀerent households watch TV
at diﬀerent times of the day. While the audience demo-
graphic changes, we consistently ﬁnd that the Pareto prin-
cipal still holds throughout the day as shown in Figure 5(a).
Figure 5(b) shows the popularity distribution as a function
of the channel ranks against the number of viewers at a short
time scale. The channel rank of 1 indicates the most popular
channel and the unpopular channels are put at the tail. We
calculate the eﬀective number of viewers by the fraction of
time a user spent on each channel over a minute period (e.g.,
a user watching a channel for 30 seconds is counted as 0.5
viewer). We take the average eﬀective number of viewers
per channel over 15 consecutive minutes. The plot shows a
straight line waist for top ranked channels (below 30) and a
truncated tail. This indicates that popularity is Zipf-like for
top channels and it decays fast for non-popular ones. Other
live video streaming systems have showed similar trends [16,
33, 34].
In our IPTV system, some channels also fail to attract
enough viewers compared to a normal Zipf distribution. The
set of channels that ranked below 100 are (a) individual
channels that users had to pay in “a la carte” billing such as
pay-per-view and certain documentary and sports channels,
(b) foreign news channels, e.g., Russia and France, which is
