### 4.1 High-Level Viewing Characteristics

In this section, we present our findings on the viewing characteristics of the IPTV system.

#### 4.1.1 Number of Simultaneous Online Users

We analyze the number of concurrent online users based on our definition of users being online and offline. Figure 3 illustrates the day-of-week trend over a representative trace period. The horizontal axis marks the start of each day. The graph in Figure 3 reveals some interesting patterns:

- **Diurnal Pattern**: The number of viewers shows a diurnal pattern with two major peaks around 3 PM and 10 PM, and a smaller peak around 8 AM. These peaks correspond to typical dining hours.
- **Comparison with Other Systems**: Similar diurnal patterns with two peaks have been observed in other video systems [16, 17].

Next, we will examine how these online users are distributed across individual channels.

#### 4.1.2 Session Characteristics

- **Average Household Viewing**: An average household watches 2.54 hours of TV and 6.3 distinct channels per day.
- **Session Duration**: The average length of each online session is 1.2 hours, consisting of multiple surfing and viewing events.
- **Traditional Surveys**: According to Nielsen [20], an average household watches television for approximately 8 hours and 14 minutes per day, while an individual watches for 4 hours and 34 minutes. Other surveys report that an average household in Australia watches 3 hours of TV a day [21], and an average person in the UK watches TV for 3 hours and 38 minutes a day [22].

**Channel Holding Times**:
- **Overall**: The median and mean channel holding times are 8 seconds and 14.8 minutes, respectively, indicating a significant fraction of short-interval activities (surfing) and some longer-duration activities (viewing).
- **Surfing**: Median and mean channel holding times are 6 and 10 seconds.
- **Viewing**: Median and mean channel holding times are 4.8 minutes and 10.7 minutes.
- **Away**: Median and mean channel holding times are 3.1 hours and 5.7 hours.

**Sojourn Times**:
- **Frequency Analysis**: Using a representative day trace, Figure 4 shows the frequency of sojourn times (time spent watching a channel before changing) in a log-log scale.
- **Pattern**: The frequency increases from 1 to 4 seconds and then drops quickly. Most channel changes occur 4 seconds after the previous change.
- **Factors Affecting Sojourn Times**: The effective channel switching time (zapping time) and individual recognition abilities may influence this pattern, but further investigation is needed.

**Weekend Patterns**:
- **Viewer Trends**: Unlike Internet usage patterns [18], Friday and Saturday consistently have the lowest evening peaks. On weekends, the number of viewers increases early in the morning, likely due to children's programming.
- **Detailed Trends**: On weekends, the number of distinct viewers increases by 5%, and the total time spent on TV increases by 30%. This trend has also been reported in a survey of UK workers' leisure time use [19].

#### 4.1.3 Attention Span

When watching television, viewers browse through on-air programs until they find something interesting. The process involves:
- **Browsing Content**: Deciding whether to continue or stop streaming.
- **Switching Channels**: Repeatedly browsing multiple channels until a desired one is found.

**Channel Holding Times by Genre**:
- **Summary Table**: Table 1 summarizes the characteristic channel holding times for various genres.
- **Median Values**: Ranging from 6 to 11 seconds, indicating very short viewing periods before channel changes.
- **Percentile Values**: The 90th and 95th percentile values show larger variations, ranging from 3 to 21 minutes.
- **Genre Differences**: Music and sports have shorter attention spans compared to kids, free, mixed, and cine genres.

#### 4.1.4 Time Spent on Each Genre

We investigate the fraction of time users spend on different genres. Table 2 summarizes the percentage of time spent on each genre over the trace period:
- **Popular Genres**: Free and mixed genres account for over 50% of TV viewing instances.
- **Comparative Data**: [30] reports that news, public affairs, comedy, and drama genres account for over 60% of TV viewing in Canada.
- **Regional Content**: Local channels are popular, with each region having one or two local channels.
- **Differences**: Our findings differ from those reported for the US population [31]. For instance, [31] reports higher percentages for kids and docu channels, which could be due to different social behaviors or changes in viewing behavior under tracking devices.

### 4.2 Channel Popularity and Dynamics

The current IPTV system continuously sends multicast streams of all channels to destinations in the backbone (i.e., DSLAMs). However, this fixed distribution may become impractical as the number of channels increases.

**Network Cost Minimization**:
- **Strategy**: One strategy to minimize network costs is to use multicast for some channels and unicast or P2P for others [32].
- **Importance of Measurement**: Accurate measurement of channel popularity is critical for designing such systems.

#### 4.2.1 Popularity Distribution

**Aggregate Viewership**:
- **Figure 5(a)**: Shows the aggregate fraction of viewers accounting for the least x-th popular channels. The top 10% of channels account for nearly 80% of viewers, reflecting the Pareto principle (80-20 rule).
- **Consistency**: This pattern holds consistently throughout the day, despite changes in audience demographics.

**Short-Term Popularity**:
- **Figure 5(b)**: Illustrates the popularity distribution as a function of channel ranks against the number of viewers at a short time scale.
- **Top Channels**: The plot shows a straight line waist for top-ranked channels (below 30) and a truncated tail, indicating Zipf-like distribution for top channels and rapid decay for non-popular ones.
- **Similar Trends**: Other live video streaming systems have shown similar trends [16, 33, 34].

**Channels with Low Popularity**:
- **Underperforming Channels**: Some channels fail to attract enough viewers compared to a normal Zipf distribution. These include pay-per-view, certain documentary and sports channels, and foreign news channels (e.g., Russia and France).

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the viewing patterns and channel popularity, which are essential for optimizing the IPTV system.
