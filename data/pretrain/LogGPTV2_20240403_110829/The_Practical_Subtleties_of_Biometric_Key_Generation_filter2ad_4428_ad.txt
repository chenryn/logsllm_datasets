### Information Leakage and Biometric Recovery

While auxiliary information and templates individually may seem harmless to an adversary, their combination can lead to the easy recovery of biometric data. To demonstrate this, we apply the techniques from [3] to generate guesses of the user's biometric samples. In [3], we describe a set of statistical measures that can be computed using population statistics and map these spatial measures to the most likely pen speed. In that work, we assume limited knowledge of the target user’s biometric and create a partial forgery by composing static samples from the user, then infer timing information to complete the forgery.

In the current approach, we do not need to assume access to the target user’s biometric because the (x, y) coordinates of the enrollment samples are stored in the template. We apply our method from [3] to make an initial guess at the user’s biometric. Then, we use an intelligent search algorithm to enumerate other biometrics that are "close" to the first guess. The algorithm focuses on features with high variance across the population, reducing the search space by exploiting conditional relationships between features.

### Empirical Evaluation

To empirically evaluate our attack, we used the same dataset as in Section 5. Our implementation of the BKG had a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 29.2% and a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 1.7%, which aligns with the FRR/FAR of 28%/1.2% reported in [17]. If we follow the computation of inter-personal variation as described in [17], we would incorrectly conclude that the scheme creates keys with over 40 bits of entropy, consistent with the estimate provided in [17]. However, this is not the case (see Figure 2).

Specifically, the fact that the template leaks information about the biometric enables an attack that successfully recreates the key 22% of the time on the first try. Approximately 50% of the keys are correctly identified after making fewer than \(2^{15}\) guesses. The significance of this analysis lies not in the effectiveness of the described attack but in the original analysis's failure to consider auxiliary information when evaluating the security of the template.

### Impact of Key Compromise on Strong Biometric Privacy

We highlight the importance of quantifying the privacy of a user’s biometric against adversaries who have access to the cryptographic key (i.e., REQ-SBP from Section 3). We examine a BKG proposed by Hao et al. [16]. The construction generates a random key and then "locks" it with a user’s iris code. The construction uses a cryptographic hash function \( h : \{0, 1\}^* \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^s \) and a "concatenated" error correction code consisting of an encoding algorithm \( C : \{0, 1\}^{140} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^{2048} \) and the corresponding decoding algorithm \( D : \{0, 1\}^{2048} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^{140} \). This error correction code is a composition of a Reed-Solomon and Hadamard code [16, Section 3].

Iris codes are elements in \( \{0, 1\}^{2048} \) [8]. The BKG works as follows: given a user’s iris code \( B \), select a random string \( K \in \{0, 1\}^{140} \), and derive the template \( T = (h(K), B \oplus C(K)) \), outputting \( T \) and \( K \). To later derive the key given an iris code \( B' \) and the template \( T = (t_1, t_2) \), compute \( K' = D(t_2 \oplus B') \). If \( h(K') = t_1 \), then output \( K' \); otherwise, fail. If \( B \) and \( B' \) are "close," then \( t_2 \oplus B' \) is "close" to \( C(K) \), differing in only a few bits. The error correcting code handles these errors, yielding \( K' \).

Hao et al. provide a security analysis arguing for requirement REQ-KR using both cryptographic reasoning and a standard estimate of entropy of the input biometric. They provide empirical evidence that auxiliary information cannot be used to guess a target user’s biometric and a cryptographic argument that, assuming the former, the template and auxiliary information cannot be used to guess a key. They conservatively estimate the entropy of \( K \) to be 44 bits. Moreover, the authors note that if the key is ever compromised, the system can be used to "lock" a new key, since \( K \) is selected at random and is not a function of the biometric.

Unfortunately, given the current construction, compromise of \( K \) in addition to the public information \( T = (t_1, t_2) \) allows one to completely reconstruct \( B = C(K) \oplus t_2 \). Thus, even if a user were to create a new template and key pair, an adversary could use the old template and key to derive the biometric and then use the biometric to unlock the new key. The significance of this is worth restating: because this BKG fails to meet REQ-SBP, the privacy of a user’s biometric is completely undermined once any key for that user is ever compromised.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we examine a series of requirements, pitfalls, and subtleties commonly overlooked in the evaluation of biometric key generators (BKGs). Our goal is to encourage rigorous empirical evaluations that consider the impact of publicly available data to ensure that a BKG (I.) ensures the privacy of a user’s biometric and (II.) outputs keys suitable for cryptographic applications. Our exposition brings to the forefront practical ways of thinking about existing requirements that help elucidate subtle nuances often overlooked in biometric security. As we demonstrate, failure to consider these requirements may result in overestimating the security of proposed schemes.

To underscore the practical significance of each of these requirements, we present analyses of three published systems. While we point out weaknesses in specific constructions, it is not our goal to fault those specific works. Instead, we aim to highlight flaws in the standard approaches followed in each setting. In one case, we exploit auxiliary information to show that an attacker can guess 15% of the keys on her first attempt. In another case, we highlight the importance of ensuring biometric privacy by exploiting the information leaked by templates to yield a 22% chance of guessing a user’s key in one attempt. Lastly, we show that subtleties in BKG design can lead to flaws that allow an adversary to derive a user’s biometric given a compromised key and template, thereby completely undermining the security of the scheme.

We hope that our work encourages designers and evaluators to analyze BKGs with a degree of skepticism and to question claims of security that overlook the requirements presented herein. To facilitate this type of approach, we not only ensure that our requirements can be applied to real systems but also introduce Guessing Distance—a heuristic measure that estimates the uncertainty of the outputs of a BKG given access to population statistics.
