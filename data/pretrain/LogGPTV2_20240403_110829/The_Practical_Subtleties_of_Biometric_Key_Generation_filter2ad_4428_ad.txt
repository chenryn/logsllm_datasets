information. Unfortunately, while by themselves the
auxiliary information and the templates seem to be
of little use to an adversary, when taken together, the
biometric can be easily recovered.
Analysis. To demonstrate this, we apply the techniques
of [3] to generate guesses of the user’s biometric sam-
ples. In [3] we describe a set of statistical measures that
can be computed using population statistics, and map
these spatial measures 3 to the most likely pen speed.
In that work we assume limited knowledge of the target
user’s biometric, and compose static samples from the
user to create a partial forgery, then infer timing informa-
tion to make a complete forgery. In the current approach,
we need not assume access to the target user’s biometric
because the (x, y) coordinates of the enrollment samples
are stored in the template. Thus, we apply our approach
from [3], to make a guess at the user’s biometric. Then,
we use an intelligent search algorithm that enumerates
other biometrics that are “close” to the ﬁrst guess. The
algorithm focuses the bulk of its work searching for the
outputs of the features that exhibit high variance across
the population, and reduces the search space by exploit-
ing conditioning between features.
To empirically evaluate our attack, we used the same
data set as in Section 5. Our implementation of the BKG
had a FRR of 29.2% and a False Accept Rate (FAR) of
1.7%, which is inline with the FRR/FAR of 28%/1.2%
reported in [17]. Moreover, if we follow the computation
of inter-personal variation as described in [17], then we
would incorrectly conclude that the scheme creates keys
with over 40 bits of entropy with our data set, which is
the same estimate provided in [17]. However, this is not
the case (see Figure 2).
In particular, the fact that the
template leaks information about the biometric enables
an attack that successfully recreates the key 22% of the
time on the ﬁrst try; approximately 50% of the keys are
correctly identiﬁed after making fewer than 215 guesses.
In summary, the signiﬁcance of this analysis does not lie
in the effectiveness of the described attack, but more so
in the fact that the original analysis failed to take auxil-
iary information into consideration when evaluating the
security of the template.
7 The Impact of Key Compromise on
Strong Biometric Privacy
Lastly, we highlight the importance of quantifying the
privacy of a user’s biometric against adversaries who
have access to the cryptographic key (i.e., REQ-SBP
from Section 3). We examine a BKG proposed by Hao et
al. [16].4 The construction generates a random key and
then “locks” it with a user’s iris code. The construction

uses a cryptographic hash function h : {0, 1}
→ {0, 1}s
and a “concatenated” error correction code consisting of
an encoding algorithm C : {0, 1}
2048, and
the corresponding decoding algorithm D : {0, 1}
140. This error correction code is the composition
{0, 1}
of a Reed-Solomon and Hadamard code [16, Section 3].
Iris codes are elements in {0, 1}
→ {0, 1}
2048 [8].

The BKG works as follows: given a user’s iris code B,
select a random string K ∈ {0, 1}
140, and derive the tem-
plate T = h(K), B ⊕ C(K), and output T and K. To
′ and the template
later derive the key given an iris code B
T = t1, t2 , compute K
′). If h(K
′) = t1,
′ = D(t2 ⊕ B
then output K
′ are “close”
to one another, then t2 ⊕ B
′ is “close” to C(K), perhaps
differing in only a few bits. The error correcting code
handles these errors, yielding K
′, otherwise, fail. If B and B
′ = K.
Hao et al. provide a security analysis arguing require-
ment REQ-KR using both cryptographic reasoning and a
standard estimate of entropy of the input biometric. That
is, they provide empirical evidence that auxiliary infor-
mation cannot be used to guess a target user’s biometric,
and a cryptographic argument that, assuming the former,
the template and auxiliary information cannot be used to
guess a key. They conservatively estimate the entropy
of K to be 44 bits. Moreover, the authors note that if
the key is ever compromised, the system can be used to
“lock” a new key, since K is selected at random and is
not a function of the biometric.
Unfortunately, given the current construction, com-
in addition to the public information
promise of K,
T = t1, t2 , allows one to completely reconstruct
B = C(K) ⊕ t2. Thus, even if a user were to create a
new template and key pair, an adversary could use the
old template and key to derive the biometric, and then
use the biometric to unlock the new key. The signiﬁ-
cance of this is worth restating: because this BKG fails
to meet REQ-SBP, the privacy of a user’s biometric is
completely undermined once any key for that user is ever
compromised.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we examine a series of requirements, pit-
falls, and subtleties that are commonly overlooked in the
evaluation of biometric key generators. Our goal is to
encourage rigorous empirical evaluations that consider
the impact of publicly available data to show that a BKG
(I.) ensures the privacy of a user’s biometric, and (II.)
outputs keys that are suitable for cryptographic applica-
tions. Our exposition brings to the forefront practical
ways of thinking about existing requirements that help
elucidate subtle nuances that are commonly overlooked
in regards to biometric security. As we demonstrate,
failure to consider these requirements may result in es-
timates that overstate the security of proposed schemes.
To underscore the practical signiﬁcance of each of
these requirements, we present analyses of three pub-
lished systems. While we point out weaknesses in spe-
ciﬁc constructions, it is not our goal to fault the those spe-
ciﬁc works. Instead, we aim to bring to light ﬂaws in the
standard approaches that were followed in each setting.
In one case we exploit auxiliary information to show that
an attacker can guess 15% of the keys on her ﬁrst attempt.
In another case, we highlight the importance of ensuring
biometric privacy by exploiting the information leaked
by templates to yield a 22% chance of guessing a user’s
key in one attempt. Lastly, we show that subtleties in
BKG design can lead to ﬂaws that allow an adversary to
derive a user’s biometric given a compromised key and
template, thereby completely undermining the security
of the scheme.
We hope that our work encourages designers and eval-
uators to analyze BKGs with a degree of skepticism, and
to question claims of security that overlook the require-
ments presented herein. To facilitate this type of ap-
proach, we not only ensure that our requirements can
be applied to real systems, but also introduce Guessing
Distance—a heuristic measure that estimates the uncer-
tainty of the outputs of a BKG given access to population
statistics.
