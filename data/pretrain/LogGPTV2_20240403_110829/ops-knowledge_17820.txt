User: Analyze the execution plan of a SQL query, explain the tables involved in the query, the indexes used, and make optimization suggestions
Assistant: Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot actively analyze the execution plan of a SQL query like a human being. I need to provide specific SQL query statements for analysis. At the same time, it is necessary to clarify the database structure and data size of the query, as well as the specific purpose and requirements of the query, in order to give effective optimization suggestions. Specific requirements: Please provide specific SQL query statements, database structure and data scale, as well as the specific purpose and requirements of the query.
