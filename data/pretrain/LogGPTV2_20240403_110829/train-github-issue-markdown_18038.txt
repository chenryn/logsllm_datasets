Hi,
We have had a setup using Playwright that accesses Business central for more
than 2 years running smoothly. 4 different processes running several time a
day and each proces runs +45 times.
Since update to version 22.X of Business central the process stalls just after
business central has logged in (can see login in the AD).  
Business central is stalled at 'Getting Ready...' seems to go into loop. We
await next step and have tried to expand the wait significantly but Business
central never continues.
Have tried Microsoft business central support but without luck - they say that
this is not supported by them. Tech guy helping me has been really helpful but
think he was 'closed down' as the Business Central Group does not see it as
being their issue.....no changes til Business Central will happen to mitigate
around this.
We have tried many things - and we have different documentation and can also
create further documentation if it can help.
We have a Business Central version 21 running and the process runs
successfully as they have done for over 2 years - related to this we have
Playwright trace files and HAR files
We have a Business Central version 22.X running and the process stalls every
time and we have tried hundreds of times - related to this we have Playwright
trace files and HAR files also
Have tried both of the above with a dedicated VPN also - no difference.
Is there anybody out there who could help us in any way??  
Does anybody know how to interpretate the files?  
This has been down since 4. June now so if anybody knows anything that they
believe could help we would really appreciate!
