User: I know my friend's external IP (from whatsmyip) and internal IP (e.g 192.168.1.x) and he knows mine. How do I establish a TCP connection with him?
Is it possible to do it without any port forwarding? Or do I require a server with an external IP to transfer messages between me and him?
Assistant: Basically, it isn't (shouldn't be) possible for you to connect to your friends private IP through his firewall. That's the point of firewalls :-o
Two solutions - the simplest is a port forwarding rule on his firewall, the second is as you suggest an external server that both clients connect to.
