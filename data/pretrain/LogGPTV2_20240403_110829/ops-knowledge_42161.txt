Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple fatal errors occurring in the kernel software component. The errors include instruction address, data storage interrupt, machine check, program interrupt, and data address. The instruction address and data address errors both occurred at 0x00004ed8, while the data address error occurred at 0x00000002. The data storage interrupt occurred multiple times.
