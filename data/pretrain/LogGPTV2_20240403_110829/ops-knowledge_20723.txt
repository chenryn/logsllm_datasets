Assistant: Here are a few ways to optimize web page loading speed to improve user experience and search rankings: 1. Image optimization: Compress images and use a suitable format, such as JPEG or PNG, to reduce file size and increase loading speed. 2. Cache: Browser cache is to store static resources locally so that they can be loaded faster when visiting the website again. 3. Minify code: Minify and merge CSS and JavaScript files to reduce the number of HTTP requests. 4. Reduce HTTP requests: Reduce HTTP requests by using CSS Sprites to combine multiple images into one file, or using data URIs instead of images, etc. 5. Loading order: Put JavaScript at the bottom of the page and CSS at the head. 6. Website hosting: Choose a reliable hosting provider and use a content delivery network (CDN) to speed up your website's global access. 7. Lean Design: Avoid lots of animations, Flash and other "decorative" elements. These methods will not only help you improve user experience, but also improve your search engine rankings, as the quality of your website will be an important factor in search engine algorithms.
