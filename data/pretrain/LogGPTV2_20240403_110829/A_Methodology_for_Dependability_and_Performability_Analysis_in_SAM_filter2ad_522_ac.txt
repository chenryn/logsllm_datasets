Initially, the system is ready for a check clearing
request, and every faulty node is up. Accordingly, the
initial marking of the model is:
M(Ready) = {READY }
M(N etworkState) = {(U P, x)|x ∈ BAN K ∪ LIN K}
M(Data) = M(Success) = M(F ailure) = φ
4.2. The SRN Model
After the stochastic information has been incorpo-
rated into the SAM model, a SRN model can be derived
by ﬁrst unfolding the PrT net model. To get a clearer
view of the SRN model, we divide this work into two
parts. First, we derive a SRN segment by unfolding
the part of SAM model with regard to the states of
faulty nodes in the payment system. Then the rest
of SAM model is unfolded to get another SRN seg-
ment that depicts the routing paths for each request in
the payment system. By unfolding transition change
and the connected place NetworkState, we can derive
the SRN segment regarding the network state, as il-
lustrated in Figure 5. A box in the ﬁgure represents
a timed transition. A faulty node fails at its failure
rate, and is repaired at its repair rate. The places U Px
and DOW Nx in the ﬁgure represent that node x is up
and down respectively. The timed transitions Fx and
Rx represent that node x fails and node x is repaired
respectively. Using the marking dependent rate of a
SRN, we can model both an independent fail (repair)
event and a dependent fail (repair) event as speciﬁed
in the SAM model. In Figure 5, for example, the de-
pendency of failure rate of linkA1 on the state of bank
A is speciﬁed by the marking dependent ﬁring rate of
timed transition F linkA1. When bank A is down, it
is easier for linkA1 to fail (λa1  t1 ∼ t6, t13 ∼ t21
