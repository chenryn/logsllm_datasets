### What problem does this feature solve?
for example in render function:
    const a = 'Hello world unReactivity'
    export default {
    render(c){
    return c(div,[a])
    }
    }
here the a is not a reactivity data,but when we use template,it seems that we
must make a to be a reactivity data?sometimes is not in need.
### What does the proposed API look like?
    {{ a }}
