James Cook of slack came up with an interesting problem of inference:
    function foo(scale)
        output(x) = scale + x
        output(::Float64) = output("")
        return output
    end
    bar(x) = foo(5)(x)
    baz = foo(5)
Here, `bar(3)` is inferred to `Any`, but `baz(3)` is correctly inferred. Is
there any reason for this? Shouldn't both be inferred completely?
