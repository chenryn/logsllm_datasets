User: How to create users and configure their permissions in Linux system?
Assistant: To create a user and configure its permissions in a Linux system, follow these steps: 1. Log in to the root user or sudo user of the Linux system. 2. Execute the following command to create a new user: ``` sudo adduser <username> ``` where <username> is the username you want to create. 3. Set a password for the new user. Execute the following command: ``` sudo passwd <username> ``` where <username> is the username you created. 4. Configure permissions for the new user. You can configure permissions for new users by adding them to a user group. For example, if you want to add a new user to the sudo group so that it has sudo privileges, you can execute the following command: ``` sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> ``` If you want to add the new user to a different user group , you can replace "sudo" with the corresponding group name. 5. Check that the new user's permissions are configured correctly. You can check the permissions of a new user by executing the following command: ``` groups <username> ``` where <username> is the username you created. 6. If you need additional custom configuration of the new user's permissions, you can edit the /etc/sudoers file. Note that you should edit this file very carefully so as not to break your system. The above are the basic steps to create a user and configure its permissions in the Linux system. Remember that any changes to a Linux system should be done with care to avoid damaging the system.
