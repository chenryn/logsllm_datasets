### Team Overview and CTF History

**Date: Friday, July 31, 2009**

#### Team Photo
Here is a photo of the team, with two members missing. I am partially visible in the back. The rest of the team includes:

- **Plato**: Likely the only lawyer to ever win a CTF.
- **@tlas**: Team captain and individual CTF winner in 2005.
- **Mezzendo**: Dual network sniffer and defender.
- **Shiruken**: Sysadmin extraordinaire and always the life of IRC during qualifiers.
- **Fury**: Defender (or his twin; you have to watch out for twins).
- **Doc Brown**: Reverser/exploiter par excellence and maintainer of nopsr.us.
- **Wrffr**: A secret weapon with incredible reversing and exploiting skills, but little recognition outside the group.

**Missing Members:**
- **Apu**: Network monitor, defender, and physical security coordinator, utilizing his ex-marine skills.
- **Jrod**: Strong contributor to the exploitation side and a frequent Defcon and BlackHat presenter/trainer.

As for me, I must not be too good at anything yet since I’ve bounced from defense to offense and everything in between over the years. Fortunately, they keep letting me hang around anyway.

#### CTF Overview
Capture the Flag (CTF) is the ultimate hacking game (legally, of course). It requires reverse engineering and exploiting dozens of never-before-seen network services, all while defending, monitoring, patching, and generally going crazy over the course of two and a half days.

#### CTF History
There were essentially three different groups that ran CTF:
- **DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 8**: BOFH (Defcon Goons) ran it, mostly as a free-for-all mayhem.
- **DEFCON 9 to DEFCON 12**: The Ghetto Hackers took over and revamped the structure to the one we know today, where a select group of teams maintain their own identical (at the start) virtual machine and attack everyone else’s. They also added the concept of the qualifier round in 2004.
- **DEFCON 13 to DEFCON 16**: Kenshoto assumed control, refining and tweaking the game design with game theory and slick architectures. They provided many other bits of fun, such as the annual tossing of fortune cookies with custom hidden messages.
- **DEFCON 17 (2009)**: DDTEK (Diutinus Defense Technologies Corp) is running the CTF this year, with a qualifier round similar to Kenshoto's previous ones.

#### Qualifier Round
The qualifier round ensures that the playing field is narrowed before the event starts. Here is the final scoreboard for DDTEK’s 2009 qualifying round, which ran for 48 straight hours starting June 5 at 2300 UTC.

#### Top Teams
**sk3wl of r00t**
- Winners of the 2004 and 2008 Defcon CTF.
- Composed primarily of students from the Naval Postgraduate School.
- Team captains: Jon Boss (BossMan) and Chris Eagle (sk3wlm4st3r), an outright binary ninja and pirate rolled into one.
- Dominated early and often in both quals and finals, using their large team effectively.

**team awesome (aka VedaGodz)**
- Composed of mostly first-timers to the CTF scene.
- Led for much of the qualifiers but succumbed to sk3wl’s might at the end.
- Questions remain about how they will perform in the final, as being good at quals is often different from dealing with the environment and challenges during the final.

**sexy pandas (AKA Pandas with Gambas, Osu, Tatakae, Sexy Pandas!, woobi woobi pandas, Sexy Pwndas, Ailuropoda Melanoleucas)**
- Spanish team known for strong reversing and exploitation skills.
- Often starts strong but has had poor finishes in the past.
- Their strong finish in this year’s quals is a good indicator of their quality.

**PLUS@postech**
- One of the many ROK (Republic of Korea) teams that have been storming the top 10 in recent years.
- Primarily made up of undergraduates from Postech (Pohang University of Science and Technology).

**Shellphish**
- Formed from a group out of the University of California Santa Barbara, led by Giovanni Vigna.
- Permanent fixture in many CTFs (Defcon and otherwise).
- Runs the iCTF, the International Capture the Flag primarily for academic groups worldwide.
- Won in 2005 and participated in many other finals.

**Song of Freedom (송오브프리덤)**
- Another Korean powerhouse.

**Lollerskaterz**
- Diverse collection of international friends that has changed membership over the years.
- From a small 3-person team in 2007 to a larger team now.
- Occasionally smaller teams are interested in picking up some ronin, so if you have a strong interest in playing but aren’t on a qualified team, be patient, polite, and ask around.
