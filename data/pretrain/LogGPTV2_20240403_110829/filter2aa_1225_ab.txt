Jrod, also missing from this picture, is another strong contributer to the exploitation side of 
things, and a frequent Defcon and BlackHat presenter/trainer.
As for me, I must not be too good at anything yet since I’ve bounced from defense to offense 
and everything in between over the years.  Fortunately, they keep letting me hang around 
anyway.

Here’s a decent shot of everybody on the team except for two members.
I’m partially visible here in the back, and the rest of the team is:
Plato -- likely the only lawyer who ever has or ever will win CTF
@tlas -- team captain and individual CTF winner in 2005
Mezzendo -- dual network sniffer in addition to defending
Shiruken -- sysadmin extraordinaire (and always the life of IRC during quals whether we’re 
competing or not)
Fury -- or his twin, you gotta watch out for twins, defender
Doc Brown -- reverser/exploiter par excellence and maintainer of nopsr.us
Wrffr -- a secret weapon who gets very little recognition outside the group, but is an 
incredible reverser/exploiter with a long CTF history.
I mentioned Apu was missing in this photo, he has the distinction of acting not only as a 
network monitor and defender, but also as our physical security coordinator, utilizing his ex-
marine skills.

CTF
Friday, July 31, 2009
Capture the ﬂag is the ultimate hacking game (legal one, anyway).  It requires reverse 
engineering and exploiting dozens of never-before-seen network-services all while 
defending, monitoring, patching, and generally going crazy over the course of two and a half 
days.

Hopefully you saw the previous presentation, with a bit more detail on the history of CTF.  If 
not, grab the video when it gets put online.  
There were essentially three different groups who ran CTF.  From DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 8 
BOFH (Defcon Goons) ran it, with a couple of different styles, but it was mostly free-for-all 
mayhem.
(??)
Friday, July 31, 2009
Then from DEFCON 9 to DEFCON 12, the Ghetto Hackers took over and eventually revamped 
the basic structure to the one we know today where a select group of teams maintain their 
own identical (at the start) virtual machine and attack everyone else’s.  Additionally, they 
added the concept of the now-common qualiﬁer round in 2004.
Friday, July 31, 2009
Finally, the illustrious Kenshoto assumed control from DEFCON 13 to DEFCON 16, reﬁning 
and tweaking the game design with a splash of game theoretics and a bunch of very slick 
architectures.  Not only did they have some impressive challenges, but they provided many 
other bits of fun as the annual tossing of the cookies (fortune cookies with custom hidden 
messages being tossed from their balcony).
Friday, July 31, 2009
And ﬁnally, this year we have DDTEK (Diutinus Defense Technologies Corp), whose qualiﬁer 
round was indeed very similar to the Kenshoto qualiﬁers of years past and most likely a very 
similar CTF is underway as I speak.
Friday, July 31, 2009
This year and the previous ﬁve CTFs have included a qualiﬁer round.  Because the event itself 
is so popular, the qualiﬁer round ensures that the playing ﬁeld is narrowed before the event 
even starts.
Here’s the ﬁnal score board for DDTEK’s 2009 qualifying round that ran for 48 straight hours 
starting June 5 at 2300 UTC.

What’s a good security presentation without a Sun Tzu quote?  
I’m sure it says something very wise about winning.
If you want to compete at next year’s CTF, ten of your most likely opponents are competing 
in the other room right now, so let’s take a look at those teams now, presented in the order 
they qualiﬁed in.
sk3wl of r00t
Friday, July 31, 2009
Winners of the 2004 and 2008 Defcon CTF, sk3wl of r00t is primarily composed of students 
from the Naval Postgraduate School (http://www.nps.edu/).  The team captains are Jon Boss 
(BossMan) who keeps things running smoothly and frees up the other captain, Chris Eagle 
(sk3wlm4st3r) who is an outright binary ninja and pirate rolled into one. Incredibly difficult 
challenges have been created solely to give him some entertainment.
They dominate early and often in both quals and ﬁnals, last year putting up a true beat-down 
on the rest of the competition when they were able to effectively make use of their large team.  
That may have been in no small part due to Eagle’s Collabreate Tool (http://
www.idabook.com/collabreate/), a collaborative plugin to the IDA Disassembler.  Which he 
graciously released as open source... immediately after the competition ended.  That was one 
of Eagle’s many great hacks.

team awesome
Friday, July 31, 2009
(aka VedaGodz) Composed of mostly ﬁrst-timers to the CTF scene, they led for much of the 
qualiﬁers, but succumbed to sk3wl’s might at the end.  Sk3wl was likely being gracious as 
the previous winners because the previous years CTF winner typically has an automatic entry 
into the next ﬁnal. It’s very gentlemanly of them then to not take control of the board and 
inﬂuence the qualiﬁers, so no one knows exactly how much they were holding back.
Another big question mark will be how TeamA performs during the ﬁnal.  Being good at quals 
is often a very different thing from dealing with the environment and different challenges 
during the big dance.
I do have some friends on this team, so while 1@stplace is on a hiatus this year, you’ll likely 
see me hanging out with these guys.

These Spaniards have often been cursed with a great start and a poor ﬁnish during ﬁnals, but 
they deﬁnitely don’t lack for solid reversing and exploitation skills. They’ve made strong 
showings in a number of other CTFs and are always a threat, especially if they can keep the 
tempo they usually start with.  Their strong ﬁnish in this years quals is a good indicator of 
the quality of their team.

years, PLUS is back this year after a one year hiatus.   Plus is primarily made up of 
undergraduates from Postech (the Pohang University of Science and Technology).

Formed from a group out of the University of California Santa Barbara, and led by Giovanni 
Vigna, Shellphish is a permanant ﬁxture of many CTFs (Defcon and otherwise).  Additionally, 
the group runs the iCTF, the International Capture the Flag primarily for academic groups 
world-wide (http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/). Shellphish is a staple of the CTF scene, winning in 
2005, and participating in many other ﬁnals as well.

Lollerskaterz is a diverse collection of international friends that has changed membership 
over the years, from the small 3-person team that stormed the 2007 Quals, to the current 
larger team (they expected to bring ﬁve here currently, and might add a few others while 
they’re here)
While most teams have their compositions ﬁxed, there are occasionally smaller teams 
interested in picking up some ronin, so if you have a strong interest in playing but aren’t on a 
qualiﬁed team, be patient, polite and ask around, and you might be able to join a team with 
open seats, but be warned that for many teams, it’s unlikely if you don’t know someone on it.
