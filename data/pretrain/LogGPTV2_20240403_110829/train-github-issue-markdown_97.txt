# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18999.0
    Windows Terminal version: 0.5.2762.0
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open a new PowerShell tab. PowerShell version does not matter.
  2. Paste and run the following code in the PowerShell tab:
    Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier Powershell.Exiting -Action { Set-Content -Value "Hello there." -Path "$env:TEMP\General Kenobi.txt" }
  4. Close the PowerShell tab by clicking the x button or by the `exit` command. Or close the Terminal window.

# Expected behavior
The PowerShell tab should trigger the Powershell.Exiting event and a file
`%temp%\General Kenobi.txt` should be created.
# Actual behavior
The event does not trigger and no file is created.
Note: If you reproduce this in the native PowerShell 5 or 7-preview.3 console
(not the Terminal app) you'll find that the event triggers correctly only when
using the `exit` command. Clicking the close button also does not trigger the
event. Although I also reported that at PowerShell/PowerShell#8000, I believe
that with Terminal it's an independent issue.
