Though we can specify query granularity and intervals in search query spec.,  
search query runner ignore those and scans whole the interval of the given
segment and works with `QueryGranularity.ALL`.
For example, in `testSearchWithCardinality()` of `SearchQueryRunnerTest`,  
it requests search for interval [2011-01-12, 2011-02-28) and [2011-03-01,
2011-04-15) within a segment of interval [2011-01-12, 2011-04-15] and unions
the results.  
But, it actually scans whole the segment for each interval and results in
duplicated counting of matching entries.
As a result, you can see that the result count from `testSearch()` is much
smaller than that of `testSearchWithCardinality()` even though `testSearch()`
has larger query interval.
