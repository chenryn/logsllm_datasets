User: I use tornado websocket send/recv message, the client send json message, and server recv message and json parse, but why the server get message which is mutil json message, such as {"a":"v"}{"a":"c"}, how to process this message
Assistant: Maybe you should delimit the messages you send so it is easy to split them up - in this case you could add a \n, obviously the delimiter mustn't happen within the message. Another way would be to prefix each message with its length in also a clearly-delimited way, then the receiver reads the length then that number of bytes and parses it.
