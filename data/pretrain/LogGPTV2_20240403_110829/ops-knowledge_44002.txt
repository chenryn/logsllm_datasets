User: Given the following data structure, please write a script to find the largest and smallest value in a set of numbers [15, 23, 5, 12, 8, 3, 27, 16, 5, 9, 1]
Assistant: The following code can be used to find the maximum and minimum values in a set of numbers: ``` numbers = [15, 23, 5, 12, 8, 3, 27, 16, 5, 9, 1] max_num = numbers[0 ] # initialize the maximum value to the first number min_num = numbers[0] # initialize the minimum value to the first number for num in numbers: if num > max_num: max_num = num # update the maximum value elif num < min_num: min_num = num # Update the minimum value print("Maximum value:", max_num) print("Minimum value:", min_num) ``` In the above code, we initialize the maximum value and minimum value as the first number, and traverse all the values in the list number. If the current number is greater than the maximum value, update the maximum value; if it is smaller than the minimum value, update the minimum value. Finally output the maximum and minimum values. The output is: ``` Maximum: 27 Minimum: 1 ```
