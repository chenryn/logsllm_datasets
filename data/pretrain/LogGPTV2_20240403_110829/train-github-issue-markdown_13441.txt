This was a nice, though unexpected change with 3.2, but i have one request.
Can we pretty please have table-related display options? Obviously I can just
add these myself to my instance, but I would love to see this officially
supported. The use case is legit to me; something like input group add-ons,
which in some cases may not make sense to show in a mobile environment but add
a nice touch in desktop. Since these are display: table-cell by default, to
only that element in desktop you'd need something like
.visible-lg-table-cell {  
display: table-cell !important;  
}
Thanks for your consideration. I don't know how much table-row or others might
be used, but display: table-cell would come in handy.
