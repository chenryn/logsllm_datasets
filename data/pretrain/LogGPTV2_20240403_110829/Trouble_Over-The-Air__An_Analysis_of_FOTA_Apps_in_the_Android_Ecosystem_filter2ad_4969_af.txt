### Analysis of FOTA Installers

#### Installer: `com.samsung.android.app.omcagent`
- **Number of Packages Installed**: 489
- **Breakdown of Installed Packages**:
  - 42% belong to 32 Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) such as Vodafone, T-Mobile, and Movistar.
  - 13% are Samsung-specific packages.
  - 6% are from video game publishers like Gameloft and Herocraft.
  - 2% are Amazon-related packages.
  - The remaining 37% are from various software publishers, including social media (e.g., Facebook) and streaming services (e.g., Chilli, Spectrum).

#### Malware Installations
- **Cause**: These installations may occur due to compromised third-party vendor code included in the OEM images, similar to the case of the Triada trojan found in devices from several Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).
- **Impact**: Unwanted apps installed under system partitions cannot be removed by users or security tools and require an OEM update.

#### Installer: `com.google.android.gms`
- **Functionality**: This package installs only mobile device management (MDM) apps, enabling the administration of corporate devices.
- **Possible Reasons**:
  - Vendors use system updates to ship apps included in newer commercial agreements with third-party developers.
  - These apps may be shared components of the vendors' app ecosystem used for installation initiated by other apps, such as vendors' app stores.

### Malicious Installations
- **Observation**: FOTA packages install a variety of non-system packages, raising concerns about potential malware or potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).
- **Findings**:
  - 7 out of 20 FOTA packages install at least one unwanted app.
  - Five of these packages have a low ratio of unwanted app installations (0.1% to 2.8%).
  - The unwanted apps are identified as adware, smsreg, or hiddad, which can show intrusive ads or collect personal identifiable information.
  - Two FOTA packages, `com.android.settings` and `com.qiku.android.ota`, have a high ratio of unwanted app installations (35% and 92%, respectively).
    - `com.android.settings` installs the largest number of malicious apps, including instances of the Triada trojan and the Necro trojan dropper.
    - `com.qiku.android.ota` surprisingly installs only malware, including trojans like Triada, Necro, and Guerilla.

### Discussion

#### Security and Privacy Implications
- **Google's Recommendations**: Google provides recommendations for FOTA updates, but these are often vague on best security practices.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - 2% of FOTAs in the dataset are signed by default AOSP test keys, allowing any app signed by the same key to run in the same process as the FOTA app.
  - 90 devices contain an `otacerts.zip` file with these default AOSP test keys, allowing any update signed with one of these test keys to be installed.
  - These issues can lead to severe vulnerabilities, potentially allowing a malicious actor to gain full control of the device.

#### Separation of Purposes and Capabilities
- **Issue**: Many FOTA apps include install capabilities for regular, non-system apps, leveraging their full control of users' devices for secondary purposes (e.g., commercial partnerships).
- **Risk**: This opens the door to the installation of unwanted or potentially harmful apps without user consent.
- **Recommendation**: System and non-system updates should be separated and managed by different processes with different privileges and installation mechanisms.

#### Transparency
- **Complexity**: FOTA capabilities can be spread over multiple APK files and implemented by multiple stakeholders for different tasks.
- **Challenges**:
  - Understanding and controlling a wider spectrum of stakeholders increases complexity and risk.
  - Users often lack visibility into who has the ability to update and install apps in their system.
  - FOTA apps are rarely publicly available or documented, and their privacy policies are hard to find.

### Limitations
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Analyzing FOTA apps dynamically is challenging due to:
  - Apps requiring the platform key to run.
  - Device-specific dependencies.
  - Need to interact with production FOTA servers.
- **Telemetry Analysis**: Provides real-world data from user devices where FOTA apps are originally installed, helping to overcome some of these limitations.

### Related Work
- **Previous Studies**: Recent studies have investigated security and privacy concerns related to Android pre-installed apps and their supply chain.
- **Complementary Findings**: Our work complements these efforts by exploring the dynamic nature of the FOTA process, which continues after the device is purchased.

### Conclusions
- **Key Findings**:
  - The Android FOTA ecosystem is complex and fragmented, with FOTA apps developed by various first- and third-party actors.
  - This fragmentation can lead to potential privacy-intrusive practices and insecure behaviors.
  - FOTA apps can install non-system apps, including abusive malware and PUPs.
- **Future Work**: We hope our results will inform better designs and increase the security and privacy of the overall Android ecosystem.
