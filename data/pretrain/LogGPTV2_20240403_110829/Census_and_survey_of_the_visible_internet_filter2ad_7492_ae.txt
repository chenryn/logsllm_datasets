### 5.2 Estimating the Number of Very Stable Addresses

Our survey, which is consistent with other similar studies, defines addresses with 95% or better availability as very stable. Based on our data, 16.4% of the responsive addresses in the survey are classified as very stable, corresponding to the mode of addresses with availabilities at A > 0.95.

#### Projecting to the Entire Internet

We can project this estimate to the entire Internet using two methods:

1. **Extrapolation from the Survey:**
   - Our survey identified 1.75 million responsive addresses in 17,500 responsive /24 blocks, indicating an average of 16.4 stable addresses per responsive block.
   - The corresponding census found 2.1 million responsive blocks, suggesting an upper bound of 34.4 million very stable, occupied addresses in the entire Internet. This estimate depends on the mapping between the survey and the census.

2. **Direct Projection from the Census:**
   - Given that the census identified 103 million responsive addresses, we estimate that 16.4% (or 16.8 million) of these addresses are potentially very stable.
   - However, this estimate does not account for the fact that our survey was biased (by only surveying previously responsive blocks and blocks selected from a range of A, U values). Additionally, our survey is more robust to packet loss, as each address was probed more than 916 times over a week, compared to just once in the three-month census. Therefore, we consider the first estimate to be an upper bound on the size of the visible Internet.

#### Sources of Error

Several potential sources of error in this estimate include:
- **ICMP-Responsive Multipliers:** Section 3.2.3 suggests multipliers of 1.61 or 1.86 as the best projections from the ICMP-responsive Internet to Internet-accessible computers.
- **Multi-Homed Hosts or Routers:** These represent an overcount of up to 6% of addresses (Section 3.4).
- **Newly Occupied Addresses:** Some addresses were not stable because they were newly occupied mid-way through our census. We estimated births in survey data and found it to account for less than 1% of addresses.
- **Statistical Measurement Error:** Due to sample size, this error is about 0.4% (Equation 1).

Taking these factors into account, the error-corrected estimate is 52 million to 60 million very stable addresses on the public Internet.

#### Relationship Between Stable Addresses and Servers

There is a loose relationship between stable addresses and servers on the Internet. In our technical report [18] (omitted due to space), we studied hosts serving web, MySQL, FTP, and SSH. That study suggests that, at USC, 58% of stable addresses are not servers (presumably always-on client machines), and there are about 1.5 times more servers than those at stable addresses. In other words, half of the servers we found were down more than 5% of the time. Examination of DNS records suggests that many non-stable servers are either dynamic hosts running web servers or embedded devices turned off at night.

### 5.3 Trends in Internet Address Utilization

Given that the IPv4 address space is finite and limited to 32 bits, the rate of address allocation is crucial. Concerns about address space exhaustion [15] were the primary motivation for IPv6 [6] and CIDR [11] as interim conservation strategies. They also motivated the deployment of Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, allowing multiple computers to share a single globally routable address [48].

#### Address Space Allocation and Utilization

Figure 9 and Table 1 show trends in address space allocation and utilization computed over each individual Internet address. To provide context, around 4.3 billion addresses are possible, but after eliminating private and multicast address space, only 2.8 billion public unicast addresses are allocated. This evaluation represents the number of addresses, not actual host computers, since multiple computers may be hidden behind a single NAT box.

- **Linear Regression Analysis:**
  - Allocation is growing at about 106 million addresses per year (about 4% per year since 2004).
  - The number of visible addresses grows at 17.2 million per year (28% of the 2004 baseline).

Interpreting these results requires caution, as address allocation is far from uniform. Many ISPs give out individual, dynamic addresses to users, while businesses and ISPs receive addresses in power-of-two blocks, which are rarely fully utilized.

### 6. Trends in Firewall Deployment

A significant number of Internet hosts lie behind firewalls, which restrict, block, or rate-limit traffic according to private local policies. Firewalls affect the visibility of hosts in censuses. In this section, we study trends in the deployment of visible firewalls over 15 months to understand their impact on our observations.

#### Counting Hosts Behind Firewalls

Counting hosts behind firewalls is challenging because the goal of a firewall is often to shield hosts from external access. Measuring firewalls themselves is also difficult, as many simply drop packets, making them invisible to our probes. Some firewalls, however, respond to ICMP echo requests with negative acknowledgments, indicating that communication is "administratively prohibited." We use this information to estimate the number of firewalls and firewalled addresses.

#### Terminology and Definitions

- **Firewall:** A software or hardware device that intentionally hides from our probes an active network interface connected to the public Internet and assigned a public IP address. (We do not count hosts behind NATs with private IP addresses.)
- **Silent Firewalls:** Discard the probe without reply.
- **Visible Firewalls:** Generate a reply indicating communication is administratively prohibited.
- **Access-Control Lists in Routers:** One implementation of visible firewalls.
- **Personal Firewalls:** Software firewalls protecting a single machine.
- **Block Firewalls:** Typically implemented by routers, PCs, or dedicated appliances, covering a block of addresses.

#### Methodology

To count firewalls, we subdivide the negative replies to a census. We consider responses of type 3, destination unreachable, with codes 9, 10, and 13, indicating network, host, or communication administratively prohibited, to indicate the presence of a visible firewall. We then compare the probed address P to the source address of the reply message R. When P = R, the host itself replied, and we classify P as a personal firewall. When P ≠ R, we conclude that a block firewall with address R replied on P's behalf. Positive responses (echo replies) or negative responses not indicating administrative prohibition are classified as non-ICMP-firewalled addresses.

#### Coverage Measurement

To measure coverage, we examine all probed addresses Pi with the same reply address R to determine the firewalled block covered by firewall R. A block firewalled by R is the largest [l, h] address range such that l and h elicit an administratively prohibited reply, and ∀ p ∈ [l, h], replies to probes to address p are either administratively prohibited from R, a positive reply from p, or no response. We require h − l < 2^16 to avoid degenerate cases. This definition tolerates lost probes and considers the common practice of allowing a few publicly-visible hosts in the middle of an otherwise firewalled range of addresses.

#### Evaluation

We analyze our censuses to estimate the number of firewalled addresses, the number of firewalled blocks, their distribution by size, and their evolution over time.

- **Size of Firewalled Address Space:**
  - Figure 10 shows the absolute number of addresses and the ratio of firewalled to responsive addresses.
  - The ratio of firewalled to responsive addresses has been increasing, indicating a growing trend in firewall deployment.

This analysis provides a lower bound on the total number of firewalls, as we miss silent firewalls.
