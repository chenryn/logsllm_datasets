### Guide 18: Creating a Holographic Template

1. **Paper Source Configuration**:
   - Go to the **Paper tab**.
   - Scroll down to **Paper Source**.
   - Select the **Manual Feed** radio button.

2. **Creating the Holographic Template**:
   - A state’s hologram typically features the state’s crest or seal. For example, the Texas hologram simply repeats the state’s name.
   - If you need to create your own template, use your organization’s seal or crest and customize it as needed.
   - Ensure proper spacing if you are using your organization’s name.

3. **Template File Preparation**:
   - When creating the template file, ensure the image is correctly oriented for lamination.
   - The text should be inverted so that when printed on the back of the laminate, it appears normal when viewed from the front.

4. **Applying Perl-Ex Pigment Powders**:
   - Mix 1 part Interference Gold and 2 parts Sparkle Gold in a mixing dish.
   - Use a brush or a suitable applicator to apply a very light glaze of the mixture to the rough side of the laminate.
   - **Note**: Always apply to the rough side (the side with glue) and avoid touching it with your fingers to prevent unwanted oils and dirt.

5. **Glazing Technique**:
   - The glaze should be so light that no reflection of Pearl-Ex is visible when viewed directly.
   - When the laminate is angled, a nice reflection should be seen.
   - Place the laminate with the Pearl-Ex facing up into the Alps printer and print the desired template.
   - After printing, wash off the remaining Pearl-Ex with soapy water to avoid it becoming difficult to remove.

6. **Final Product**:
   - The Alps printer seals the areas with images or text, creating a holographic effect.
   - Unfortunately, no final product images are available, but the results are remarkable.

### Guide 19: Stamp Method with Ultra Violet

#### Materials Needed:
- Customized stamp (e.g., from www.simonstamp.com)
- Perl-Ex Pigments (1 gram Interference Gold, 2 grams Sparkle Gold)
- Transparent base (water or acrylic based)
- Aluminum foil
- Toothbrush (for cleaning the stamp)

#### Process:
1. **Mixing Pigments**:
   - Mix 2 grams of Sparkle Gold, 1 gram of Interference Gold, and 1 gram of Green UV pigment powder.
   - Alternatively, use a 1:2 ratio of Interference to Sparkle.

2. **Preparation**:
   - Lay out a square piece of aluminum foil on a flat surface.
   - Place 1-5 drops of transparent base and ¼ teaspoon of Pearl-Ex mixture in the center.
   - Mix the substances together in circular motions until homogenized.

3. **Application**:
   - Smooth the mixture over a large area of the aluminum foil, ensuring it is very thin and even.
   - Place the stamp lightly in the center of the mixture.
   - Transfer the stamp to the Teslin and gently stamp it onto the printed card face.

4. **Practice and Testing**:
   - Practice to perfect the technique.
   - Shine a UV light in a dark room to see the hologram’s effect.

### Guide 20: Silkscreen and Stencil Methods

#### Materials Needed:
- Regular Laser Printable Transparencies
- Silkscreen products (e.g., PhotoEZ for beginners)
- Hologram Template

#### Process:
1. **Printing the Template**:
   - Print the hologram template onto a Laser Printable Transparency.

2. **Exposure**:
   - Place the transparency on the PhotoEz exposure sheet and expose it to sunlight for the recommended time.
   - Follow the provided instructions.

3. **Cleaning**:
   - Soak the exposed sheet in tap water for 15 minutes.
   - Scrub the unexposed areas with a toothbrush or brush until clean.

4. **Application**:
   - Use the cleaned screen/stencil to apply paint to a piece of ready-to-laminate Teslin.

### Guide 21: UV Images via Pigment Powder

#### Materials Needed:
- Alps md-1300 printer
- Laminate sheets
- Pigment powders
- Tape

#### Process:
1. **Printing and Alignment**:
   - Print the desired designs onto plain paper, flipping the image horizontally in Photoshop.
   - Tape the corners of the printed sheet to a flat surface.
   - Place a laminate sheet, adhesive side up, over the printed sheet and tape the corners.

2. **Applying Powder**:
   - Apply a smooth, even amount of powder over the printed areas.
   - Use a flat top brush to spread the powder evenly.

3. **Printing and Washing**:
   - Send the laminate sheet through the Alps printer, printing the same designs in black using the finish cartridge.
   - Wash off the excess powder with warm water.
   - The sealed areas will remain, and the powder will become transparent upon lamination, fluorescing under UV light.

### Guide 22: Airbrush Method of Pearl-Ex and UV Pigment Application

#### Materials Needed:
- Pearl-Ex Pigment Powder mixture
- UV Pigment Powder
- Isopropyl alcohol
- Laminate

#### Process:
1. **Mixing Pigments**:
   - Mix 2 grams of Sparkle Gold, 1 gram of Interference Gold, and 1 gram of Green UV pigment powder.
   - Fill the airbrush reservoir with the mixture and isopropyl alcohol, shaking well before and during application.

2. **Application**:
   - Spray an even coat of the mixture onto a piece of laminate in a dark room with UV light.
   - Allow the laminate to dry in the sun for over an hour.

3. **Finishing**:
   - Complete the hologram using the Alps Printer Method as described above.

### Guide 23: Invisible UV Ink Application

#### Materials Needed:
- HP printer compatible with HP 51645A inject cartridges
- UV ink and related materials from http://practicingperfection.7p.com

#### Tips:
1. **Cleaning**:
   - Clean alcohol-based and solvent-based ink carts with an alcohol prep pad or q-tip dipped in alcohol.
   - Clean water-based ink carts with a q-tip dipped in water.
   - Avoid using alcohol on water-based carts and vice versa.

2. **Adjusting Settings**:
   - Adjust ink flow and dry time settings as needed.
   - Prop the cart in the correct position for 24 hours if necessary.

3. **Fixing Flow Issues**:
   - Use the orange fill tool to correct flow issues.
   - Follow the detailed steps for cleaning and priming the cartridge.

By following these guides, you can create high-quality holograms and UV images for various applications.
