Once the printer has been conﬁgured, it is time to create a holographic template.  For example, a state’s holograph is 
usually made up of the state’s crest or seal.  Often times it is even as simple as just the state’s name repeated (like the 
Texas hologram).  If you have to create your own holographic template, use your organizations seal or crest, and edit 
it to your own advantage.  If you want to make your hologram the name of your organization, then it is just a matter 
of proper spacing.
When you create the template ﬁle you will have to create the template so that during lamination the image is correctly 
shown.  Here is a picture of a template ﬁle as seen on a computer monitor:
Notice how the text has been inverted so that it can be printed on the back of a piece of laminate.  This is so when the 
laminate is turned over, it looks normal.  
In order to take advantage of the Alps printer, we will need to apply a layer of Perl-Ex Pigment Powders.  Take a 
mixing dish and mix 1 part Interference Gold and 2 parts Sparkle Gold.  You may make your own combinations as 
you see ﬁt. Use a brush or a Giant Chocolate Covered Fuzzy Banana to make a very light Peal-Ex glaze onto a piece of 
laminate.  ALWAYS APPLY TO THE ROUGH SIDE OF THE LAMINATE. The rough side of the laminate is the side 
that has the glue on it.  The glue will become activated during lamination.  Make sure never to touch the rough side of 
the laminate with your ﬁngers, otherwise you get unwanted oils and dirt on your ﬂawless works of art.

Next, apply a very light glaze.  It should be so light 
that when looking directly down onto the laminate 
you should not see any reﬂection of Pearl-Ex.  
Although, when you change the position to the light, 
you will see a very nice reﬂection.  In the following 
picture you can see how when looking strait on to the 
image, all you can see is a whitish glaze.  However, the 
top portion of the laminate that has been angled away 
from the light appears to be gold.  
The next step would be to put the piece of laminate 
with the Pearl-Ex facing up into the Alps printer and 
print your desired template.  After your template has 
been printed, you must wash the remaining Pearl-Ex 
off of the laminate.  You can do this in the sink with 
soapy water.  If you leave the Pearl-Ex on the laminate 
for too long without washing off the excess, it will 
become increasingly difﬁcult to wash as the hours go 
by.  
The Alps printer seals in the areas that had an image or 
text on them, so when you wash away the Pearl-Ex, an 
image will remain in holographic form!  Unfortunately 
no pictures of the ﬁnal product are included, as an 
Alps printer was not available during the making of 
this guide.  However, I can assure you they are 
remarkable.

The Process
Now that we have all your materials ready, we can begin.
1) Start by mixing the 2 grams of Sparkle Gold, 1 gram of Interference Gold, and 1 gram of Green UV pigment 
powder.  If you do not have those exact amounts then it is just 1 part Interference for every 2 parts Sparkle.  
2) Next lay out a square piece of aluminum foil on a ﬂat surface.
3) Place 1-5 drops of transparent base in the center of the aluminum foil along with ¼ of a teaspoon of Pearl-Ex  
mixture. 
4) With your ﬁnger, in circular motions quickly mix the two substances together until homogenized. You must 
work fast.  The base will dry!
5) Now for the tricky part.  With your ﬁnger again, smooth the mixture over a large area of the aluminum foil 
extremely thin.  DO NOT go over the same area with your ﬁnger too many times; otherwise you will cause that 
area to become too dry.  It must be very, very thin, but still wet.
6) Before the mixture becomes to dry, place the stamp lightly in the center.
7) Move the stamp over to the front of the Teslin, and gently stamp it onto the front of the already printed card 
face.  (Apply to the Teslin before it has been laminated or dye cut, but after the graphics have been printed).

2) Place transparency on to the 
PhotoEz exposure sheet and 
place in the sun for allotted time 
period.  Follow the directions 
supplied 
by 
your 
products 
provider.
3)  Take the PhotoEz exposure 
sheet and let it soak in tap water 
for 15 minutes. 
4) Scrub sheet with toothbrush or 
brush until the unexposed areas 
become clean.
5) Now you have a new screen/
stencil which can be used in the 
same manner a screen printer 
would apply paint to a t-shirt.  
Instead of a t-shirt however, you 
would be applying the paint 
directly to a piece of ready to be 
laminated Teslin.

UV Images Via Pigment Powder– by Anonymous
UV images via pigment powder applied to letter sized laminate sheets by Alps md-1300/ﬁnish cartridge method:
Get an Alps md-1300; far superior to the md-1000 or md-5000. Print a sheet of your desired designs onto plain paper. 
Remember to ﬂip the sheet in photoshop horizontally before you print. (so they will read backwards) This is because you'll be 
printing on the adhesive side of the laminate. Once it's sealed it will read the right way. Now tape the corners of the sheet to 
your desk or workspace taking care to ensure the sheet is completely ﬂat. Now lay a letter sized sheet of laminate, adhesive 
side up, over top of it and tape the corners to your desk in the same fashion. It is important that the left side and top side 
align with the sheet below. But the right side and bottom are ok if not perfectly aligned. Now apply a smooth, even amount of 
powder onto the laminate in the general areas where the page below is printed with your designs. Then using a ﬂat top brush 
spread, or smear if you will, the powder into a nice 'even' shellac over the print below and a bit extra just to be sure. Most 
importantly, you want to see consistent groupings of powder on the laminate sheet before sending it through the Alps 
printer. Not clumps or wads. 
The ﬁnal step is to send the laminate sheet through the Alps, and print the same designs as the sheet of plain paper below 
was printed in black. Only this time you set the printer to print in single color mode using only the ﬁnish cartridge. Then 
wash the excess powder off of the laminate sheet with warm water and something soft. No need to be gentle really. The 
powder under the areas sealed by the ﬁnish cartridge are there to stay. And even though the powder is visible on the laminate 
at ﬁrst, it becomes transparent upon lamination. However, under UV incandescence, the designs ﬂuoresce brilliantly and 
evenly throughout. Magniﬁcent to behold. 
Keep in mind that Alps printers were not designed to be used this way. However, they seem to have a high threshold for 
punishment, thankfully. You will want to clean the printer after every session though. An air duster is crucial. Also, print a 
couple of sheets of your design with a standard ink color religiously following each session as well as before switching from 
one color of powder to another.”

The Process
Now that we have all your materials ready, we can begin.
1) Start by mixing the 2 grams of Sparkle Gold, 1 gram of Interference Gold, and 1 gram of Green UV pigment 
powder.  If you do not have those exact amounts then it is just 1 part Interference for ever 2 parts Sparkle.  The best 
part of this process is the fact that we get to use the UV Pigment Powder.  Under normal applications, use of the 
pigment power without using an  airbrush gives us very poor results..  
2) Put your mix inside the paint reservoir, and ﬁll to the brim with isopropyl alcohol.  The pigments and the alcohol 
will not homogenize, so constant shaking is necessary before and during application.  
3) Go into a dark room and turn on the UV light.  Spray an even coat of the mixture onto a piece of laminate and set it 
out into the sun for over 1 hour to dry.
4) Finish the hologram via the Alps Printer Method as stated above..
Invisible UV Ink Application – by Anonymous
UV images via invisible ultra violet ink applied with an HP printer compatible with HP 51645A inject cartridges.  
You may purchase everything you need for this application at http://practicingperfection.7p.com.  
“First we'll start with a couple universal tips. #1. It is recommended that you clean off alcohol based, and other solvent 
based, ink carts print heads with an alcohol prep pad or a q-tip dipped in alcohol before each session. And for water based ink 
carts, clean off the print heads with a q-tip dipped in water before each session. Never use alcohol on a water based cart, or 
water on an alcohol based. If you do, you'll have crappy prints from then on. Don't press too hard when doing so, just light 
brisk strokes. #2. If it is leaving streaks, adjust the ink ﬂow and or dry time to a lower setting. #3. If #2 doesn't work, try 
propping the cart up in the position it would be in when installed in the printer while leaving the print head tape and 
cartridge clip off for 24 hours. If this doesn't solve the problem, take off the print head sealing tape and cartridge clip and 
leave it propped up for another 24 hours. If there are still streaks, but there is noticeable improvement, chances are good that 
it will correct itself after a short time. If the streaks are still just as bad or worse, please send that cart back for a replacement.

For the porous blue and porous white carts, you should have nothing but great results with any setting combination. And 
you are free to run the cleaning cycles, as well as the priming cycle as you feel necessary.
With the porous yellow carts you should get great results with any ﬂow and dry time settings. Feel free to run the cleaning 
cycles as you feel necessary, but avoid the priming cycle 'if possible.'
With the porous red and porous orange carts you may need to turn the ink ﬂow 
and/or dry time down to avoid occasional streaks. But do try it all full throttle 
as it will produce a brighter print. Double passing may be necessary to achieve 
desired results. Cleaning cycles may be run 'if need be' but avoid running the 
prime cycle 'if possible.'
With the water based yellow carts set your ink ﬂow and dry time setting to full 
blast as a rule. Run the cleaning cycles 'if need be' and prime if necessary. Also 
is a good idea to store 'upside down' when not in use. A short and brisk shake 
before use may be beneﬁcial, only as needed though.
With the dye based yellow carts, both 100% pure and 3-1, set the ink ﬂow and dry time settings to full blast as a rule. Avoid 
running the cleaning cycles until 'absolutely necessary' and NEVER ever run the prime cycle. If the prints are not printing 
in certain little areas of the page repetitively, don't worry. It will correct itself after a few prints. Simply adjust to the 
handicap until it's no longer an issue.
Here is the procedure for ﬁxing ﬂow issues using the orange ﬁll tool pictured to the right. When attempting to correct the 
issue, start by ﬂipping the cart upside down with the print head up. Then dip a sponge tipped q tip in the purest alcohol you 
can scare up. Then gently glide the tip of the q-tip across the print head in the direction of the grain. (little parallel lines) But 
while gliding it across, twist the tip in a counter clockwise fashion (if you’re right handed). Then wipe or blot the tip of the q-
tip off on a paper towel 'before' executing another pass. Do this a few times and then place into the orange tool. Keeping the 
cartridge upside down, placed in the tool nice and snug, insert the tip of the syringe into the little hole located on the tool. 
Make sure that there is no air inside the syringe. Now SLOWLY and OBSERVANTLY pull up on the plunger and the ink 
should start to bubble and spatter a bit into the syringe. Continue to pull, maybe even rotating the tip of the syringe counter 
then clockwise a couple times to make sure there is no more air lurking inside, until you notice that there are no more bubbles 
but just a steady stream of ink exiting the cart. Then stop and remove the cart 
from the tool. DO NOT ﬂip the cart back to normal upright position before 
removing the syringe or the cart from the tool! Now repeat the entire q-tip & 
alcohol process again with the cart still remaining upside down. NOW ﬂip the 
cart over and slap it into your printer and print a test page. If the test page 
print is less than desirable, follow up with the cleaning cycle and then the 
prime cycle if necessary. If the prints look good after the cleaning or 
intermediate cleaning, refrain from priming as it can 'sometimes' complicate 
an already satisfactory situation. A small percentage of the time really...but as 
the old saying goes...if it ain't broke...you know the rest. 8^)”
