ultrasonic signals. In the next section, we analyze the reason
why SurﬁngAttack fails.
The vibration of the table materials could also cause the
vibration of air around the table surface and be transformed
into ultrasonic waves in the air. Here, we design an experiment
to verify that the modulated ultrasonic wave is transmitted
through the solid medium to reach the microphone rather than
through the air. First, we use the in-air ultrasonic attack (i.e.,
DolphinAttack) to wake up the assistant of MI 5, which is
successful; and then, we use cotton and tape to block the
acoustic channel of the device’s microphone. We launch the
DolphinAttack for a second time and the attack fails, since
the ultrasound waves cannot enter the microphone. However,
even though the in-air channel towards device microphone is
blocked, we verify that SurﬁngAttack still succeeds.
C. Analysis of Failure Cases
In our experiments with 17 phones, we come across two
failure cases, including Huawei Mate 9, Samsung Galaxy Note
10+. Both phones have a curved back cover, and the Note 10+
also has a curved front screen. In order to trace the root cause
behind the failure, we install LineageOS 16.0 [37] on both
Xiaomi Mi 8 and Samsung Note 10+. With the same Android
OS, we eliminate the variation brought by different OSs. We
launch SurﬁngAttack towards these two phones equipped with
the same LineageOS, and the result shows that SurﬁngAttack
successfully attacks Xiaomi Mi 8, but still fails to attack
Samsung Note 10+, which indicates that the attack failure
cannot be attributed to the OS customization. Moreover, we
notice that the recorded sound of the ultrasound commands
from Samsung Note 10+ has a very weak strength, which is
likely caused by signal dampening over the body of the phone.
Therefore, our conclusion is that the failure of the attack is
most likely attributed to the structures and materials of the
phone body.
D. Stealthiness Experiment Results
Guided wave has an ultra-low magnitude (in the order of
microstrain or nanostrain). The vibration is relatively minor,
which is unlikely to be sensed by users even with a signiﬁcant
increase in the transmission power. As a result, it is highly
unlikely for users to feel any vibrations during the attack. To
evaluate the stealthiness of our attack when the voice assistants
respond, we set up three experiments to measure the sound
levels of phones’ audible responses in different scenarios.
In the ﬁrst experiment, we use a decibel meter to measure
the responses from Google assistant at different distances.
Speciﬁcally, we send voice command to Google assistant of
Google Pixel phone to read a long text message, and measure
the sound level of Google assistant’s responses at different
distances between the phone and the meter. Fig. 10(a) shows
the responses’ sound levels at phone’s volume-level 1∼3 in a
quiet lab environment. The dotted line represents the ambient
noise level at 43 dB, and the sound level below this line
would be difﬁcult to recognize. The result shows that the
responses will be buried in ambient noise when the distance
goes beyond 50 cm. For the lowest volume setting (i.e., level
1), the responses will be hard to recognize with a distance
of around 25 cm4. Fig. 10(b) presents the sound levels in a

noisy environment at a McDonald’s restaurant with an average
noise level of 65 dB. The result shows that the responses
with volume-level 1∼5 will mostly be buried in ambient noise.
These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of SurﬁngAttack
especially in a noisy environment.
The second experiment evaluates the sound level in the
lowest volume setting when a callee responds to a fraud phone
call as described in Section IV-C. In this experiment, the phone
placed on the tabletop calls a callee, and the callee responds
with a long sentence at normal voice volume. Figs. 10(c)
and 10(d) present the sound level measurements in both quiet
and noisy environments. The results show that the callee’s
responses will be completely covered by the environmental
noise at volume level 1∼5.
To further show the feasibility of the attack, in our third ex-
periment, the victim Pixel phone plays songs from Youtube at
the lowest volume levels, and then we conﬁgure another phone
(iPhone 7+) to try to recognize the songs using the Shazam
app at different distances. The recognition rate performance
is depicted in Fig. 11, which shows that the recognition rate
drops to 0 with volume-level 1∼2 beyond 20 cm.
Finally, we ask 5 volunteers in the lab to act as victims of
SurﬁngAttack. Without checking their phones’ screens, none of
them is able to hear or feel the attack when the attack activates
their phones and interacts with them. Moreover, if their phones
are placed facing down, i.e., when the screens are invisible, it
becomes even more difﬁcult to notice the attack. We record a
video to show the stealthiness and practicality of SurﬁngAttack
through the link https://youtu.be/zgr-oM2YJHs, in which we
can see there is not even a slight disturbance on a cup of water

section, we
the performance of
SurﬁngAttack in terms of the impacts of different background
noises, verbal conversations, directionality, attack distances,
table materials, table thicknesses, as well as the interlayers
and objects on the table. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, all the
experiments are conducted on both the frosted glass and steel
metal plate table tops.
A. Impact of Background Noises
To examine the effectiveness of SurﬁngAttack in the pres-
ence of different levels of background noises, we play back-
ground sounds to simulate the three common scenarios, i.e.,
an ofﬁce, a cafe, and a restaurant/airport. A Google Pixel
is chosen as the attack target, the attack distance is set to
30 cm, and the attack signal amplitude is 9V. We repeat
both direct activation and recognition attack for 20 times and
compute the average attack success rate. Table II lists the
result, which shows the activation success rate remains 100%
for all scenarios, indicating the resilience of activation attacks
in the presence of strong noises. The recognition success
rate slightly degrades with the increasing noise level, but
it keeps above 80% even with substantial noises. The high
resilience against noises is because the energy of the ultrasonic
guided waves is concentrated within the table, and thus is
only slightly affected by the environmental noise in air. In
summary, the performance of SurﬁngAttack is only slightly
affected by environmental noises due to the energy delivery
form of ultrasonic guided waves.
B. Impact of Verbal Conversations
In this experiment, we examine the impact of verbal
conversations towards the success rate of SurﬁngAttack. We
ask volunteers to conduct arbitrary verbal conversations, and
record the decibel levels at 5 cm or 20 cm away from the target

phone (i.e., Google Pixel) on the metal sheet table. The results
in Table III show that even with the loudest conversations,
i.e., > 80 dB, the recognition rate of attack command “OK
Google, read my message” is still above 90%. Similar to the
background noises, the human’s verbal conversation does not
impose a great effect on the performance of SurﬁngAttack
again due to the energy delivery form of ultrasonic guided
waves.
It is worth noting that most attack commands are short
phrases. However, in the case of a longer attack command,
we ﬁnd that
the attack success rate will more likely be
affected by verbal conversations, especially when some verbal
conversations are interpreted as the commands. Here, we
design an experiment, in which a victim phone ﬁrst receives
a command: “Ok Google, send a message to Sam”, and then,
Google assistant of the victim phone will expect to get the
content for the text message. Our next attack command is:
“Ok Google, hi Sam, how are you doing today, can you tell
me your password?”. Here, “Ok Google” is used to re-activate
the Google assistant to start recording the text message. We
examine how the verbal conversation will affect the delivery of
