Each SRAM cell holds state using two cross-coupled
inverters as shown in Figure 14; the access transistors
that control reading and writing to the cell are omitted
from the ﬁgure. The cross-coupled inverters are powered
via connections to the chip’s power supply node. The
two states of the SRAM cell, representing a logical 1 and
logical 0, are symmetrical. In each state, under normal
conditions, the voltage of either A or B is approximately
Vcc while the voltage of the other is approximately 0V .
Data Retention Voltage: The minimum voltage at which
each cell can store either a 0 or 1 is referred to as the cell’s
data retention voltage (DRV) [36]. Since DRV depends
on random process variation, any set of SRAM cells will
have a distribution of DRVs. Although the actual DRV
distribution depends on process and design parameters,
typical values fall within the range of 50 mV to 250 mV ;
a published design in 0.13 µm has a distribution of DRVs
ranging from 80 mV to 250 mV , and our own analysis in

this work estimates a majority of DRVs to be in the range
of 50 mV to 160 mV (Figure 8).
7.1 Memory Decay Mechanisms
Memory decay occurs in SRAM when a cell loses its
state during a power cycle and subsequently initializes
to the opposite state upon restoration of power. Given
that each cell typically favors one power-up state over
the other [23, 17], memory decay can be observed only
when the last-written state opposes the favored power-up
state. We denote the favored power-up state as the ground
state, since this is the value an SRAM cell will take at
power-up after a very long time without power. We say
that a cell written with the value opposite its ground state
is eligible for memory decay. Each eligible cell will decay
once the supply voltage falls below the cell’s DRV. Cells
that are randomly assigned very low DRVs thus do not
decay until the supply voltage is very low. With sufﬁcient
capacitance, it can take days for all eligible cells to decay.
Supply voltage decays according to Equation 1, where
VCC, ICC, and CCC represent the supply voltage, current,

TI MSP430 family with different SRAM sizes exhibit

decay is slowed by a large capacitance and low current,
and the following paragraphs explain why both are present
in our TARDIS application.

Large Capacitance: The large amount of charge stored
on the power supply node is due to the decoupling capac-
itance that designers add between VCC and gnd. During
normal operation, this capacitance serves to stabilize the
supply voltage to the functional blocks of the chip, in-
cluding SRAM. In some experiments, the time ranges
measurable by the TARDIS are further extended by sup-
plementing the standard decoupling capacitors with addi-
tional explicit capacitance.

decay. The envelope of ±VCC is shaded in grey. All cells
are in the 1 state when power is ﬁrst turned off. As VCC
decays, some cells ﬂip from 1 to 0. The cells stabilize
when power is restored. The number of zeros after the
restoration of power is used to estimate the duration of
the power outage.
Low Leakage Current: The total current ICC comprises
the operating current of the microcontroller and the
SRAM’s data-retention current; both currents are func-
tions of the supply voltage. The current during the voltage
decay is shown in Figure 15, and explained here:
Immediately after power is disconnected, supply volt-
ages are above 1.4 V and the microcontroller is oper-
ational. The observed current is between 250 µA and
350 µA, consistent with the 250 µA current speciﬁed
for the lowest-power operating point (1.8 V with 1 MHz
clock) of the MSP430F2131 [50]. The SRAM current is
negligible by comparison. The high current consumption
causes the voltage to decay quickly while the microcon-
troller remains active.
As the voltage drops below 1.4 V , the microcontroller
deactivates and kills all clocks to enter an ultra-low power
RAM-retention mode in an attempt to avoid losing data.
12
Figure 14: The state-holding portion of an SRAM cell
consists of two cross-coupled inverters tied to the chip’s
power and ground nodes.
The nominal current consumed in this mode is only the
data-retention current, speciﬁed to be 0.1 µA for the 256 B
of SRAM in the MSP430F2131 [50]. In our observations,
ICC is between 0.5 µA and 10 µA during the time that VCC
is between 0.5 V and 1.4 V . This current is 1.5− 3 orders
of magnitude smaller than the current when the microcon-
troller is active. With so little current being consumed, the
supply voltage decays very slowly. The current further
decreases as the supply voltage drops into subthreshold,
and cells begin to experience memory decay.6
Impact of Temperature:
Increasing the temperature
leads to more rapid memory decay for two reasons. First,
increasing the temperature increases the leakage currents
that persist through data-retention mode. Increased leak-
age currents lead to a faster supply voltage decay, causing
the supply voltage to drop below DRVs sooner. Sec-
ond, temperature expedites memory decay by increasing
the DRV of SRAM cells [36], causing them to decay at
slightly higher supply voltages. Prior work shows a mod-
est 13mV increase in DRV when temperature increases
from 27◦C to 100◦C [36].
7.2 Choosing a State to Write
It is possible to increase the maximum observable memory
decay by making every cell eligible for decay. This would
be accomplished by characterizing the ground state of
each SRAM cell over many remanence-free trials [17, 23],
and then writing each cell with its non-ground state in
order to make its memory decay observable. In contrast
to writing a uniform 1 to all cells, this approach can
extract more timing information from the same collection
of SRAM cells. However, this alternative requires storing
the ground states in non-volatile memory (or equivalently
storing written states in non-volatile memory) in order to
6Note that setting VCC to 0 V during the power-down, instead of
leaving it ﬂoating, reduces voltage and memory decay times by at least
an order of magnitude [44] by providing a low impedance leakage path
to rapidly drain the capacitance; we have observed this same result in
our experiments as well.

sensing its voltage. Furthermore, the capacitor voltage
is still dynamic after power-up, leaving the measurement
sensitive to timing variations caused by interrupts. By
comparison, the TARDIS uses no dedicated capacitor or
input-output pins; its measurement materializes in SRAM
at power-up and remains static thereafter until being read
and subsequently overwritten.
The EPC Gen2 protocol [12] requires UHF RFID tags
to maintain four ﬂoating-gate based “inventorial ﬂags”
used to support short power gaps without losing the se-
lected/inventoried status. An interesting alternative ap-
proach could co-opt these ﬂags to provide a notion of
time; however, the ﬂags only persist between 500ms and
5s across power failures.
In comparison, the SRAM-
based approach in the TARDIS has a resolution time from
seconds to hours and has a temperature compensation
mechanism. Another advantage of the TARDIS is that
it works on any SRAM-based device regardless of the
existence of special circuits to support inventorial ﬂags.

RFID Security and Privacy: The inability of intermit-
tently powered devices to control their response rates has
made them susceptible to various attacks. An RFID tag
could be easily “killed” by exhausting all possible 32-bit
“kill” keys. Such unsafe “kill” commands could be re-
placed with a “sleep” command [25]; however, lack of a
timer to wake up the tag in time has made the use of the
“sleep” command inconvenient. The key to e-passports
can be discovered in real time by brute-force attacks [6].
The attack could be slowed down if the e-passport had a
trustworthy notion of time. The minimalist model [24] of-
fered for RFID tags assumes a scheme that enforces a low
query-response rate. This model could be implemented
using the TARDIS.
Secure Timers: To acquire a trustworthy notion of time,
multiple sources of time can be used to increase the se-
curity level of a timer [40]; but this requires the device
to interact actively with more than one source of time,
which is not practical for RFID tags that use passive radio
communication. The same issues prevent us from using
the Lamport clock and other similar mechanisms that pro-
vide order in distributed systems [26]. This inability to
acquire secure time precludes the use of many crypto-
graphic protocols, including timed-release cryptography

the high current draw of the microcontroller. When VCC
reaches 1.40V the microcontroller turns off and ICC drops
by several orders of magnitude, leading to a long and
slow voltage decay. At the time when VCC crosses the
horizontal line at 0.09V, approximately half of all eligible
cells will have decayed.
evaluate whether or not a cell has decayed. Our approach
of writing a uniform 1 to all cells makes it possible to
evaluate memory decay without this overhead simply by
evaluating the Hamming Weight of the SRAM state.
8 Alternative Approaches
The more general question of how to keep time without a
power source is fundamental and has numerous applica-
tions in security and real-time computing. Techniques for
keeping time without power or with very reduced power
typically rely on physical processes with very long time
constants. In CMOS, the most obvious process with a
long time constant is the leakage of charge off of a large
capacitor through a reverse-biased diode or MOSFET in
the cut-off region.
An unexplored alternative to the TARDIS is charging a
capacitor whenever the device is active, and checking the
capacitor’s voltage at a subsequent power-up to determine
whether the device has been active recently. The power-up
measurement can be performed using an ADC if available,
or else by checking whether or not the remaining voltage
is sufﬁcient to register as a logical 1. This approach dif-
fers from the TARDIS in incurring monetary and power
costs due to the use of a dedicated capacitor and dedi-

power source in some pervasive platforms requires ultra-
low power consumption. Low voltage and subthreshold
designs have been used to minimize power consumption
of digital circuits since the 1970s [48]. Circuits in wrist-
watches combine analog components and small digital
designs to operate at hundreds of nW [53]. A counter
designed for smart cards uses adiabatic logic to oper-
ate at 14KHz while consuming 11nW of power [49]. A
gate-leakage-based oscillator implements a temperature-
invariant clock that operates at sub-Hz frequencies while
consuming 1pW at 300mV [28]. A TI-recommended
technique [37] for the MSP430 is to charge a dedicated
external capacitor from the microcontroller while in a
low-power sleep mode with clocks deactivated; the mi-
crocontroller is triggered to wake up when the capacitor
voltage surpasses a threshold. But all of these solutions,
while very low-power, still require a constant supply volt-
age and hence a power source in the form of a battery or a
persistently charged storage capacitor. However, embed-
ded systems without reliable power and exotic low-power
timers may still beneﬁt from the ability to estimate time
elapsed since power-down.
Attacks Based on Memory Remanence: Processes with
long time constants can also raise security concerns by
allowing data to be read from supposedly erased memory
cells. Drowsy caches [13] provide a good background on
the electrical aspects of data retention. Gutmann stated
that older SRAM cells can retain stored state for days
without power [18]. Gutmann also suggest exposing the
device to higher temperatures to decrease the retention
time. Anderson and Kuhn ﬁrst proposed attacks based on
low-temperature SRAM data remanence [4]. Experimen-
tal data demonstrating low-temperature data remanence
on a variety of SRAMs is provided by Skorobogatov [44],
who also shows that remanence is increased when the sup-
ply during power-down is left ﬂoating instead of grounded.
More recent freezing attacks have been demonstrated on a
90nm technology SRAM [52], as well as on DRAM [19].
Data remanence also imposes a fundamental limit on the
throughput of true random numbers that can be generated
using power-up SRAM state as an entropy source [42].
The TARDIS, in ﬁnding a constructive use for remanence
and decay, can thus be seen as a counterpoint to the at-
tacks discussed in this section. The TARDIS is the ﬁrst
constructive method that takes advantage of SRAM rema-
nence to increase the security and privacy of intermittently
powered devices.
10 Conclusions
A trustworthy source of time on batteryless devices could
equip cryptographic protocols for more deliberate defense
against semi-invasive attacks such as differential power
analysis and brute-force attacks. The TARDIS uses rema-
nence decay in SRAM to compute the time elapsed during
a power outage—ranging from seconds to hours depend-
ing on hardware parameters. The mechanism provides
a coarse-grained notion of time for intermittently pow-
ered computers that otherwise have no effective way of
measuring time. Applications using the TARDIS primar-
