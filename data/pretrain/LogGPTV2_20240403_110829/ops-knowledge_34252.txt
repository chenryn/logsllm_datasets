Assistant: This log chunk shows the system powering up from sleep mode, with the PM response taking 1999 ms. The channel changed to 36,+1, and the sleep cause was 5. The GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent fetched data from a URL, and the KSOutOfProcessFetcher finished with no errors. The AirPort_Brcm43xx was enabled and disabled, and the AppleThunderboltNHIType2 powered up. The UABestAppSuggestionManager notified a best app change, and the AppleCamIn handled a wake event. Lastly, the IOThunderboltSwitch was unplugged.
