User: On Linux, specifically Debian Jessie, should I use /usr/bin/python or should I install another copy in /usr/local/bin?
I understand that the former is the system version and that it can change when the operating system is updated. This would mean that I can update the version in the latter independently of the OS. As I am already using python 3, I don't see what significant practical difference that would make.
Are there other reasons to use a local version?
(I know there are ~42 SO questions about how to change between version, but I can't find any about why)
Assistant: 1) You should not modify the system's binaries yourself directly 
2) If your $PATH variable doesn't contain /usr/local/bin, the naming of that secondary directory isn't really important. You can install / upgrade independently wherever you have installed your extra binaries.
3) For Python specifically, you could also just use conda / virtualenv invoked by your system's python to manage your versions & projects.
