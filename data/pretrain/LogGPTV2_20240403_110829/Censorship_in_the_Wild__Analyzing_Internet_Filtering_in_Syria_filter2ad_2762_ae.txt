Table 11: Top censored Israeli subnets.
Next, we focus on Israel and zoom in to the subnet level.10 Ta-
ble 11 presents, for each of the top censored Israeli subnets, the
number of requests and IP addresses that are censored and allowed.
We identify two distinct groups: subnets that are almost always
censored (except for a few exceptions of allowed requests), e.g.,
84.229.0.0/16, and those that are either censored or allowed but for
which the number of allowed requests is signiﬁcantly larger than
that of the censored ones, e.g. 212.150.0.0/16. One possible reason
for a systematic subnet censorship could be related to blacklisted
keywords. However, this is not the case in our analysis since the
requested URL is often limited to a single IP address (cs-uri-path
and cs-uri-query ﬁelds are empty). We further check, using McAfee
smart ﬁlter, that none but one (out of 1155 IP addresses) of the
censored Israeli IP addresses are categorized as Anonymizer hosts.
These results show then that IP ﬁltering targets a few geographical
areas, i.e., Israeli subnets.
5.5 Summary
The analysis presented in this section has shown evidence of
domain-based trafﬁc redirection between proxies. A few proxies
seem to be specialized in censoring speciﬁc domains and type of con-
tent. Also, our ﬁndings suggest that the censorship activity reaches
peaks mainly because of unusually high demand for Instant Messag-
ing Software websites (e.g., Skype), which are blocked in Syria. We
found that censorship is based on four main criteria: URL-based ﬁl-
tering, keyword-based ﬁltering, destination IP address, and a custom
category-based censorship (further discussed in the next section).
The list of blocked keywords and domains demonstrates the intent
of Syrian censors to block political and news content, video sharing,
and proxy-based censorship-circumvention technologies. Finally,
Israeli-related content is heavily censored as the keyword Israel, the
.il domain, and some Israeli subnets are blocked.
6. CENSORSHIP OF SOCIAL MEDIA
In this section, we analyze the ﬁltering and censorship of Online
Social Networks (OSNs) in Syria. Social media have often been
targeted by censors, e.g., during the recent uprisings in the Middle
East and North Africa. In Syria, according to our logs, popular
OSNs like Facebook and Twitter are not entirely censored and most

trafﬁc is allowed. However, we observe that a few speciﬁc keywords
(e.g., proxy) and a few pages (e.g., the ‘Syrian Revolution’ Facebook
page) are blocked, thus suggesting a targeted censorship.
We select a representative set of social networks containing the
top 25 social networks according to alexa.com as of November 2013,
and add 3 social networks popular in Arabic-speaking countries:
netlog.com, salamworld.com, and muslimup.com. For each of these
sites, we extract the number of allowed, censored and proxied re-
quests in Df ull, and report the top-10 censored social networks in
Table 12.
We ﬁnd no evidence of systematic censorship for most sites (in-
cluding last.fm, MySpace, Google+, Instagram, and Tumblr), as all
requests are allowed. However, for a few social networks (including
Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, and Flickr) many requests are blocked.
Several requests are censored based on blacklisted keywords (e.g.,
proxy, Israel), thus suggesting that the destination domain is not the
actual reason of censorship. However, requests to Netlog and Badoo
are never allowed and there is only a minority of requests containing
blacklisted keywords, which suggests that these domains are always
censored. In fact, both netlog.com and badoo.com were identiﬁed
in the list of domains suspected for URL-based ﬁltering, described
in Section 5.4.
Facebook. Recall that the majority of requests to Facebook are
allowed, yet facebook.com is one of the most censored domains.
As we explain below, censored requests can be classiﬁed into two
groups: (i) requests to Facebook pages with sensitive (political)
content, and (ii) requests to the social platform with the blacklisted
keyword proxy.
Censored Facebook pages. Several Facebook pages are censored
for political reasons and are identiﬁed by the proxies using the
custom category “Blocked Sites.” Requests to those pages trigger
a policy_redirect exception, thus redirecting the user to a page
unknown to us. Interestingly, Reporters Without Borders [21] stated
that “the government’s cyber-army, which tracks dissidents on online
social networks, seems to have stepped up its activities since June
2011. Web pages that support the demonstrations were ﬂooded
with pro-Assad messages.” While we cannot infer the destination of
redirection, we argue that this mechanism could technically serve as
a way to show speciﬁc content addressing users who access targeted
Facebook pages.

gesting that the categorization rules targeted a very narrow range
of speciﬁc cs-uri-path and cs-uri-query combinations. As shown
in Table 13, many requests to targeted Facebook pages are al-
lowed and no allowed request is categorized as “Blocked Site.”
We also identify successful requests sent to Facebook pages
such as Syrian.Revolution.Army, Syrian.Revolution.Assad, Syr-
ian.Revolution.Caricature and ShaamNewsNetwork, which are not
categorized as “Blocked Site” and are allowed. Finally, proxied
requests are sometimes, but not always, categorized as “Blocked
Site” (e.g., all the requests for the Syrian.revolution page).
Social plugins. Facebook provides so-called social plugins (one
common example is the Like button), which is loaded by web pages
to enable interaction with the social platform. Some of the URLs
used by these social plugins include the keyword proxy in the cs-uri-
path ﬁeld or in the cs-uri-query ﬁeld, and this automatically raises
the policy_denied exception whenever the page is loaded.
Table 14 reports, for each of the top-10 social plugin elements, the
fraction of the Facebook trafﬁc and the number of requests for each
class of trafﬁc. The top two censored social plugin elements (/plugin-
s/like.php and /extern/login_status.php) account for more than 80%
of the censored trafﬁc on the facebook.com domain, while the 10
social plugin elements we consider account for 99.9% (1,612,835)
of the censored requests on the facebook.com domain. To conclude,
the large number of censored requests on the facebook.com domain
is in fact mainly caused by social plugins elements that are not
related with censorship circumvention tools or any political content.
Summary. We have studied the censorship of 28 major online
social networks and found that most of them are not censored,
unless requests contain blacklisted keywords (such as proxy) in the
URL. This is particularly evident looking at the large amount of
Facebook requests that are censored due to the presence of proxy
in the query. Using a custom category, the censors also target a
selected number of Facebook pages, without blocking all trafﬁc to
the site, thus making censorship and surveillance harder to detect
(as independently reported in [19]).

7. ANTI-CENSORSHIP TECHNOLOGIES
We now investigate the usage (and effectiveness) of censorship-
circumvention technologies based on our dataset.
7.1 Tor
According to the logs, access to the Tor project website and
the majority of Tor trafﬁc were allowed in July/August 2011. In
fact, access to the Tor network was ﬁrst reported to be blocked on
December 16, 2012 [24].
Tor trafﬁc can be classiﬁed into two main classes: (1) HTTP
signaling, e.g., establishing connections with Tor directories, which
we denote as T orhttp, and (2) establishing Tor circuits and data
transfer, denoted as T oronion. To identify Tor trafﬁc, we extract
Tor relays’ IP addresses and port numbers from the Tor server de-
scriptors and network status ﬁles (available from https://metrics.
torproject.org/formats.html). We then match the extracted  triplets to the requests in Df ull to identify Tor trafﬁc.
We further isolate HTTP signaling messages by identifying all HTTP
requests to Tor directories, e.g., /tor/server/authority.z
or /tor/keys.11 This does not take into account the connections
via Tor bridges: there is no public list of them (bridges are used to
overcome ﬁltering of connections to known Tor relays), however,
Tor relays were not ﬁltered in Syria as of 2011, thus users did not
actually need to use bridges.
We identify 95K requests to 1,111 different Tor relays, 73%
