### 4. Top Censored Israeli Subnets

Next, we focus on Israel and examine the subnet level. Table 11 presents, for each of the top censored Israeli subnets, the number of requests and IP addresses that are censored and allowed. We identify two distinct groups: subnets that are almost always censored (except for a few exceptions of allowed requests), such as 84.229.0.0/16, and those that are either censored or allowed but where the number of allowed requests is significantly larger than the censored ones, such as 212.150.0.0/16.

One possible reason for systematic subnet censorship could be related to blacklisted keywords. However, this is not the case in our analysis since the requested URL often involves a single IP address (with `cs-uri-path` and `cs-uri-query` fields being empty). Further, using McAfee Smart Filter, we found that only one out of 1,155 censored Israeli IP addresses is categorized as an Anonymizer host. These results indicate that IP filtering targets specific geographical areas, specifically Israeli subnets.

### 5.5 Summary

The analysis presented in this section provides evidence of domain-based traffic redirection between proxies. A few proxies appear to specialize in censoring specific domains and types of content. Our findings suggest that censorship activity peaks mainly due to unusually high demand for Instant Messaging Software websites (e.g., Skype), which are blocked in Syria. We identified four main criteria for censorship: URL-based filtering, keyword-based filtering, destination IP address, and custom category-based censorship (discussed further in the next section).

The list of blocked keywords and domains demonstrates the intent of Syrian censors to block political and news content, video sharing, and proxy-based censorship-circumvention technologies. Additionally, Israeli-related content is heavily censored, with the keyword "Israel," the `.il` domain, and some Israeli subnets being blocked.

### 6. Censorship of Social Media

In this section, we analyze the filtering and censorship of Online Social Networks (OSNs) in Syria. Social media have often been targeted by censors, particularly during recent uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. In Syria, according to our logs, popular OSNs like Facebook and Twitter are not entirely censored, and most traffic is allowed. However, we observe that specific keywords (e.g., "proxy") and certain pages (e.g., the "Syrian Revolution" Facebook page) are blocked, suggesting targeted censorship.

We selected a representative set of social networks, including the top 25 according to Alexa.com as of November 2013, and added three popular Arabic-speaking social networks: netlog.com, salamworld.com, and muslimup.com. For each site, we extracted the number of allowed, censored, and proxied requests in Df ull and reported the top-10 censored social networks in Table 12.

We found no evidence of systematic censorship for most sites, including last.fm, MySpace, Google+, Instagram, and Tumblr, as all requests were allowed. However, for a few social networks (including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Flickr), many requests were blocked. Several requests were censored based on blacklisted keywords (e.g., "proxy," "Israel"), suggesting that the destination domain was not the primary reason for censorship. However, requests to Netlog and Badoo were never allowed, and there was only a minority of requests containing blacklisted keywords, indicating that these domains are always censored. Both netlog.com and badoo.com were identified in the list of domains suspected for URL-based filtering, as described in Section 5.4.

#### Facebook

While the majority of requests to Facebook are allowed, facebook.com is one of the most censored domains. Censored requests can be classified into two groups: (i) requests to Facebook pages with sensitive (political) content, and (ii) requests to the social platform with the blacklisted keyword "proxy."

**Censored Facebook Pages:**
Several Facebook pages are censored for political reasons and are identified by the proxies using the custom category "Blocked Sites." Requests to these pages trigger a policy_redirect exception, redirecting the user to an unknown page. Reporters Without Borders [21] noted that "the government's cyber-army, which tracks dissidents on online social networks, seems to have stepped up its activities since June 2011. Web pages that support the demonstrations were flooded with pro-Assad messages." While we cannot determine the exact destination of the redirection, this mechanism could serve as a way to show specific content addressing users who access targeted Facebook pages.

Table 13 lists the Facebook pages identified in the logs that fall into the custom category. All requests identified as belonging to the custom category are censored. However, not all requests to `facebook.com/` pages are correctly categorized as "Blocked Site." For example, `www.facebook.com/Syrian.Revolution?ref=ts` is censored, but `www.facebook.com/Syrian.Revolution?ref=ts&__a=11&ajaxpipe=1&quickling[version]=414343%3B0` is not, suggesting that categorization rules target a very narrow range of specific `cs-uri-path` and `cs-uri-query` combinations.

**Social Plugins:**
Facebook provides so-called social plugins (e.g., the Like button), which are loaded by web pages to enable interaction with the social platform. Some of these URLs include the keyword "proxy" in the `cs-uri-path` or `cs-uri-query` field, automatically raising a policy_denied exception whenever the page is loaded.

Table 14 reports, for each of the top-10 social plugin elements, the fraction of Facebook traffic and the number of requests for each class of traffic. The top two censored social plugin elements (`/plugins/like.php` and `/extern/login_status.php`) account for more than 80% of the censored traffic on the `facebook.com` domain, while the 10 social plugin elements we consider account for 99.9% (1,612,835) of the censored requests on the `facebook.com` domain. Thus, the large number of censored requests on the `facebook.com` domain is mainly caused by social plugin elements unrelated to censorship circumvention tools or political content.

**Summary:**
We studied the censorship of 28 major online social networks and found that most are not censored unless requests contain blacklisted keywords (such as "proxy") in the URL. This is evident from the large number of Facebook requests censored due to the presence of "proxy" in the query. Using a custom category, censors also target a selected number of Facebook pages without blocking all traffic to the site, making censorship and surveillance harder to detect (as independently reported in [19]).

### 7. Anti-Censorship Technologies

We now investigate the usage and effectiveness of censorship-circumvention technologies based on our dataset.

#### 7.1 Tor

According to the logs, access to the Tor project website and the majority of Tor traffic were allowed in July/August 2011. Access to the Tor network was first reported to be blocked on December 16, 2012 [24].

Tor traffic can be classified into two main classes: (1) HTTP signaling, e.g., establishing connections with Tor directories, denoted as `Torhttp`, and (2) establishing Tor circuits and data transfer, denoted as `Toronion`. To identify Tor traffic, we extracted Tor relays' IP addresses and port numbers from the Tor server descriptors and network status files (available from https://metrics.torproject.org/formats.html). We then matched the extracted triplets to the requests in Df ull to identify Tor traffic. We further isolated HTTP signaling messages by identifying all HTTP requests to Tor directories, e.g., `/tor/server/authority.z` or `/tor/keys`.

This does not take into account connections via Tor bridges, as there is no public list of them (bridges are used to overcome filtering of connections to known Tor relays). However, Tor relays were not filtered in Syria as of 2011, so users did not need to use bridges.

We identified 95K requests to 1,111 different Tor relays, with 73% of the traffic being allowed.
