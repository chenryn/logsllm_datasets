ABSTRACT
Attacks against Internet routing are increasing in number and sever-
ity. Contributing greatly to these attacks is the absence of origin
authentication: there is no way to validate claims of address own-
ership or location. The lack of such services enables not only at-
tacks by malicious entities, but indirectly allow seemingly inconse-
quential miconﬁgurations to disrupt large portions of the Internet.
This paper considers the semantics, design, and costs of origin au-
thentication in interdomain routing. We formalize the semantics of
address delegation and use on the Internet, and develop and char-
acterize broad classes of origin authentication proof systems. We
estimate the address delegation graph representing the current use
of IPv4 address space using available routing data. This effort re-
veals that current address delegation is dense and relatively static:
as few as 16 entities perform 80% of the delegation on the Inter-
net. We conclude by evaluating the proposed services via traced
based simulation. Our simulation shows the enhanced proof sys-
tems can reduce signiﬁcantly reduce resource costs associated with
origin authentication.

Routing in the Internet dictates the path that IP packets take to get
from their source to their destination. In its most general form, this
path, called the route, is a sequence of routers and the links be-
tween them. To compute such paths, routers use a routing protocol
to exchange reachability data, and perform computations on these
data to compute the desired routes. Computing the correct route is

a complicated task because of the sheer scale of the problem; sev-
eral hundred thousand routers have to perform a distributed com-
putation that must result in compatible results. The issue of scale
is somewhat mitigated by considering the Internet as consisting of
many routing domains; routing inside a domain is determined by
an intradomain routing protocol, while routing between domains
is governed by an interdomain routing protocol. Intradomain and
interdomain routing decisions are largely made independently.
The Border Gateway Protocol [27, 32] is the interdomain rout-
ing protocol used on the Internet. BGP routing domains, called
Autonomous Systems (ASes) announce IP address ranges, called
preﬁxes to its neighboring ASes. Each AS also announces the pre-
ﬁxes that it learns from each of its neighbors to its other neighbors.
The design of BGP reﬂects its egalitarian origins: ASes are trusted
to behave per speciﬁcation and to perform due diligence in provid-
ing timely and accurate routing information. In other words, BGP
does not currently provide security. The need for security in inter-
domain routing has been widely acknowledged and evaluated [31,
18, 24, 9], and interim and long-term solutions are seeking broad
adoption [17, 9, 7]. Implemented by any comprehensive routing
security solution, an origin authentication1 (OA) service validates
the delegation of address space between address authorities (e.g.,
IANA [15]), organizations, and advertising ASes. Origin authen-
tication is fundamentally grounded in ownership: the address may
be originated by an AS only if the owner has granted them the right
to to do so.
The lack of authenticated origin information is increasingly viewed
as a critical vulnerability of the Internet infrastructure [10]. In one
widely documented example, AS7007 announced it was the origin
for large portions of the IPv4 address space. As a result, a huge
part of the address space was incorrectly routed to that AS and led
to widespread outages [23]. Similarly, Zhao et al. found that there
are a great many causes that multiple ASes claim to be the origin of
a single preﬁx (called a MOAS conﬂict), almost all of them anoma-
lous [35]. The authors found that preﬁx hijacking due to apparent
misconﬁguration was a frequent cause of MOAS conﬂicts. Other
outages were similarly enabled by incorrect origin and routing in-
formation [19].
This paper considers the semantics, design,and application of
origin authentication services. We begin by formalizing the seman-
tics of address delegation. An address delegation graph represents
the delegation of IPv4 addresses from address authorities, to or-
ganizations, and ultimately ASes. We show that the semantics of
address delegation mandates that any path (i.e., delegation chain)
(cid:0)We use the term origin to refer to the AS in which a set of ad-
dresses resides. This is not to be confused with the origin attribute
of BGP, which speciﬁes the source of routing information (e.g.,
eBGP/iBGP).
165in this directed graph adheres to the following: (cid:0)) the origin of the
path is IANA (cid:1)) the path is acyclic, and (cid:2)) the last node in the path
is an AS. In the origin authentication systems considered in this pa-
per, entities delegate address space by generating and distributing
proofs reﬂecting edges in the graph. To simplify, an OA proof is
a signed statement asserting that: a) an organization has been del-
egated authority (by IANA or some organization) over a speciﬁed
address range, b) that an AS has been granted the right to be the
origin of that address range, or c) that the address range cannot be
used (reserved). Veriﬁers collect and validate proofs correspond-
ing to the delegation chains. We apply a range of cryptographic
constructions to the problem of proof construction and consider the
complexities of their application in real environments.
While identifying constructions that meet the semantic require-
ments of origin authentication is a useful and necessary endeavor,
one must also evaluate their feasibility. However, any evaluation of
this sort must be informed by an understanding of the current use of
the IP address space. We develop an approximate address delega-
tion graph for the Internet from public data. One of the key results
of this investigation shows that the delegation of IP address space is
exceptionally dense: 80% of delegation is performed by 16 entities
in our approximate graph, and 90% by 122. Moreover, these dele-
gations evolve slowly. Such results are encouraging: proof systems
are most effective where delegation is both static and dense.
It has been argued that in-band origin authentication is inherently
infeasible. We compare the costs of in-band and out-of-band mech-
anisms via traced based simulation. Our OAsim simulator models
a BGP speaker implementing several OA service designs using the
approximate address delegation graph and collected BGP update
stream data. Our simulations uncover two central results. First,
the efﬁciencies afforded by our origin authentication designs make
in-band veriﬁcation possible. For example, an in-band authenti-
cated delegation tree uses as little as one tenth the computational
resources of current solutions. Second, we found that proof sys-
tems that consolidate proofs by delegator can signiﬁcantly reduce
resource costs.
This work is not intended as a replacement for comprehensive in-
terdomain routing security infrastructures. We do not speciﬁcally
address path or attribute validation. Hence, this work addresses
only one aspect of the larger interdomain routing security prob-
lem: the creation and validation of proofs of ownership and origi-
nation. The designs and results described throughout are applicable
to any such interdomain routing security service (e.g., S-BGP [18],
IRV [9], soBGP [7, 6]).
The remainder of this paper explores the design and practical use
of origin authentication services. We begin in the following section
by describing how address space is currently delegated.
2. ADDRESS MANAGEMENT
The IPv4 address space is governed by IANA2 [15]. IANA del-
egates parts of the global address space to organizations represent-
ing commercial, public, or other interests [34]. Each organization
is free to further delegate some or all of the received address space
to any organization it desires, but is prohibited from delegating the
same address to more than one organization.
BGP is not aware of the existence of organizations. Autonomous
systems (AS) advertise the set of preﬁxes that they originate (i.e.,
the addresses within their administrative domain). While many
(cid:1)The IANA function is currently contracted to the Internet Corpo-
ration for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which some
cite as the relevant authority. Throughout, we refer to IANA inter-
changeably to refer to both the ICANN organization and the IANA
address authority function.

organizations maintain their own AS, many do not, and still oth-
ers (typically connectivity providers) may maintain more than one.
Each organization may assign its address space to the AS in which
the addresses reside. Hence, assignment is the process where an
organization gives an AS the right to originate a set of addresses.
Figure 1 illustrates several common ways that address space is del-
egated to organizations and assigned to ASes.
In the early days of IP, IANA directly delegated address space
to organizations. For example, as shown in the ﬁgure, AT&T re-
ceived 12.0.0.0/8 directly from IANA in the 1980s. As the
popularity of IP grew, it was discovered that having a single body
governing all delegation was administratively difﬁcult. Hence, reg-
istries like ARIN [3] were introduced to delegate address space
received from IANA. Organizations, such as BETA in the ﬁgure,
currently request and receive address space from the registries (i.e.,
64.1.0.0/16). Assume that BETA is a customer of the provider
AT&T, and that BETA’s network is serviced by AT&T’s AS. BETA
delegates their address space to AT&T for the explicit purpose of
providing service. The practical limitation of this “provider” del-
egation classiﬁcation is that AT&T is barred from delegating the
address further.
In practice, organizations are often delegated address space by
their provider networks. For example, consider an organization
DELTA (not shown) that is a customer of AT&T. Assume that DELTA
is given its address space by AT&T and wishes to be part of AT&Ts
AS. In this case, there is no need for delegation because DELTA’s
address space is total encompassed by AT&T (both in the logical
and physical sense). Now consider an another organization AL-
PHA that is also a customer of AT&T but wishes to run its own
AS. ALPHA may wish to be its own AS to allow multi-homing or
simply to retain control over the interdomain routing policy asso-
ciated with its network. AT&T delegates parts of its address space
to ALPHA (e.g., 12.1.1.0/24) so ALPHA’s AS can indepen-
dently advertise the addresses (e.g., as may be desirable for multi-
homing).
Assignment associates the addresses delegated to an organiza-
