    package p
    type F1 func(i int) (i int)
    type F2 func(i int, i int) (i int)
    type F3 func(i int) (i int, i int)
    Compiling this with 6g gives an error "duplicate argument i" for the F2 and F3
    lines, but does not give an error for the F1 line.  I think that either all or none
    should give errors.
    My reading of the spec is that none should give errors.  The spec does not say anything
    about the parameter names in a function type.  It is implied that they serve only as
    comments.  So I think the correct action is to change F2 and F3 to not give errors.
    But it would also be OK with me to change the spec and to make F1 give an error.
    (Of course all three should and do give an errors when used in a function declaration
    rather than a function type declaration.)
