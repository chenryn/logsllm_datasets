Evidence for Streptomyces venezuelae strains harboring potential anthelvencin biosynthetic gene cluster
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mira Choi, Korea Basic Science Institute, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Namil Lee, Woori Kim, Byung-Kwan Cho, Kyoung-Soon Jang
Secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which encode bioactive compounds such as antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, in 
Streptomyces species are often considered as a clue understanding the physiology and evolutionary aspect of those bacteria In this study, we 
present highly resolved classification of 25 Streptomyces strains, representing ten S venezuelae strains and other 15 species, using a matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer and whole-genome mining The close relationship of S 
venezuelae ATCC 14583, 14584 and 14585 strains were revealed by comparison of the bacterial protein fingerprints by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, 
meanwhile those strains were not clustered by conventional 16S rRNA sequence alignment Following whole-genome sequence alignment 
using 9 publicly available genome sequences of Streptomyces species and three S venezuelae strains was used to evaluate their phylogenetic 
relationships, and the results correlate well with the MALDI-MS results In addition, secondary metabolite BGC analysis of the genomes revealed 
that S venezuelae ATCC 14583, 14584 and 14585 distinctly shared the congocidine BGC Our findings in this study illustrate the importance of 
accurate bacterial classification and discovery of novel secondary BGCs for better utilization of metabolically relevant bacterial species

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Atsuko Miyagi, Grad. Sch. of Sci. & Eng., Saitama Univ., Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Noriyuki Ojima, Wakako Ikeda-Ohtsubo, Maki Kawai-Yamada
Rumex obtusifolius is an invasive perennial weed, which is one of the most soluble oxalate-accumulated plant among Rumex species Their oxalate 
accumulation is maintained at various constraints (high CO2 concentration, nutrition, dark, low temperature, and Al ion stress) Excess intake of 
soluble oxalate causes mineral (such as calcium and iron ions) deficiency or renal calculus for human and vertebrate However, an oxalate rich-leaf 
beetle Gastrophysa atrocyanea feed R obtusifolius as a host plant To investigate the mechanism of oxalate metabolisms in the oxalate rich-leaf 
beetle, we performed metabolomic analysis of G atrocyanea larva and adults using CE-MS The results showed that oxalate was not accumulated 
in both larva and adults Moreover, other organic acids such as lactate or citrate was highly accumulated To clarify the effects of gut bacteria on 
oxalate degradation in leaf beetle, we measured the oxalate and other metabolites in the larva fed with an antibacterial agent tetracycline-treated 
R obtusifolius leaves The results showed that oxalate contents in the larva fed with tetracycline-leaves were highly accumulated than those in 
the larva fed with control leaves Moreover, the tetracycline experiments revealed that the leaf beetle would obtain the gut bacteria from not their 
parents but their feeding leaves

The protective effect of whole grains against several chronic diseases is being supported by mounting evidence At the same time, our knowledge 
is increasing on how gut microbiota influences our health and how diet can modify its composition Herein, we studied C57BL/6J mice fed with 
bran-enriched diets, conventional and germ-free C57BL/6NTac mice, and the colonic fermentation of rye bran in an in vitro model of the human 
gastrointestinal system We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics to determine the effect of bran-enriched diets on the gut 
microbial composition and the potential contribution of microbiota to the metabolism of a novel group of betainized compounds The bran-enriched 
diets elevated the levels of betainized compounds in the colon contents and changed the composition of the microbiota by increasing the relative 
abundance of several bacterial taxa, including Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Coriobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus, Parasutterella, and Ruminococcus 
The levels of betainized compounds in the germ-free mice were significantly lower compared to conventional mice In the in vitro model, the 
production of betainized compounds was observed throughout the incubation, while the levels of glycine betaine decreased Only low levels or 
trace amounts of other betaines than glycine betaine were observed in whole-grain cereals In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that the 
bacterial taxa increased in relative abundance by the bran-based diet are also involved in the metabolism of glycine betaine into other betainized 
compounds, introducing another compound group as potential mediators of the synergistic metabolic effect of diet and colonic microbiota

Application of high-throughput MS screening to disentangle the bacterial metabolome
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Riya C Menezes, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Paolina Garbeva, Purva Kulkarni, Aleš Svatoš
Bacteria produce a wealth of structurally diverse specialized metabolites with a remarkable range of activity Recently augmented knowledge 
about bacterial genomes has revealed that many bacteria have far greater potential to produce secondary metabolites This potential, however, 
has been hampered by difficulties in metabolite extraction or non-expression of genes Many microbial gene clusters may be silent under standard 
laboratory growth conditions One promising approach to trigger the activation of cryptic biosynthetic pathways is the co-cultivation of two or more 
microorganisms in the same confined environment, leading to the production of new metabolites Because of the complexity of microbial extracts, 
advanced analytical methods are key for the successful detection and identification of co-culture-induced metabolites In the present study, the 
secondary metabolites produced by 12 phylogenetically different bacteria isolated from soil and rhizosphere were analysed Liquid Extraction 
Surface Analysis (LESA) combined with a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer was applied using various solvents The bacteria 
were also selectively cocultured and grown under three different nutrient conditions namely, nutrient-rich 1/10 TSBA; nutrient-poor Water Agar 
and Water Agar supplemented with Artificial Root Exudates Our results revealed that LESA with high-resolution MS is a powerful tool for high-
throughput extraction and detection of secondary metabolites produced by different bacteria under different culture conditions Of all the solvents 
tested, ethyl acetate/acetone (65:35, v/v) containing 01% formic acid revealed the most effective extraction Besides known secondary metabolites, 
several unknown metabolites were detected in bacterial cultures but not in any of the controls consisting of only media

In the past decade, studies on the mammalian microbiome have revealed that different animal species show wide variations in their microbial 
compositions This diversity is strongly connected to a variety of factors, especially diet, digestive strategy, and animal host phylogeny However, 
a key metagenomics study indicated functional redundancy, meaning that despite this taxonomic diversity, the functional capabilities of these 
microbial communities are similar, although certain functions were found to be enriched based on diet Here, we propose to characterize the 
metabolic content of mammalian microbiomes as a direct window into ecosystem function We have performed comprehensive metabolomics 
analyses on 101 mammalian fecal samples, as well as 34 dietary samples Our platform includes LC-MS/MS for semi-polar metabolites and lipids, 
GC-MS for primary metabolites, and GC-FID for short chain fatty acids Metabolites were identified using an in-house library of standards, and 
further explored using the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS; gnpsucsdedu) to assign putative structures and 
group compounds into chemical families based on fragmentation patterns Additionally, the microbiome of the fecal samples was analyzed by 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing We found a strong correspondence between the animals’ microbiomes and metabolomes (Mantel test: 0703; significance: 
0001), as well the association of certain chemical families with different animal groups We are currently examining how this effect differs for 
different classes of metabolites, as well as correlating between specific metabolites and microbial species, in order to better elucidate the metabolic 
capabilities of these communities and the ramifications on their ecological functions

Mass spectrometry based quantification of intracellular metabolites
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Reza Maleki Seifar, DSM, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Reza Maleki Seifar, Lucien Duchateau, Maurien Olsthoorn
Accurate quantitative data on intracellular metabolite from industrial cell cultures provides key information in metabolic engineering studies which 
is required for producing useful chemicals In quantitative analysis of intracellular metabolites a number of important considerations regarding 
sampling and sample processing are need to be taken into the account: 1) short turn over time of some of the metabolites, 2) continuation of the 
metabolism of microorganisms at the time of sampling, 3) leakage of intracellular metabolites, 4) interferences from extracellular environments, 
5) extraction efficiencies Nowadays LC-ESI-MS(MS) is one of the most widely used analytical techniques in metabolomics studies However, for 
absolute quantification of metabolites it is necessary to have access to standard chemicals and stable isotope labelled internal standards Internal 
standards are required for correction of losses during extractions and also matrix effects in MS- based quantitative analysis of metabolites 
The fully 13C-labelled internal standards could be considered as ideal internal standards Here, we present the application of fully 13C-labelled 
internal standards which have been produced by microorganisms cultured on 13C-fully labelled glucose as exclusive carbon source The sampling, 
quenching, extraction analytical method based on LC-MS/MS are presented for quantitative analysis of metabolites from two important mevalonate 
and isoprenoid pathways

Evolution of gene knockout strains of E. coli reveal regulatory architectures governed by metabolism
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Douglas McCloskey, Biosustain, DTU, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Sibei Xu, Troy E. Sandberg, Elizabeth Brunk, Ying Hefner, Richard Szubin, Adam M. Feist, Bernhard O. Palsson
Biological regulatory network architectures are multi-scale in their function and can adaptively acquire new functions Gene knockout (KO) 
experiments provide an established experimental approach not just for studying gene function, but also for unraveling regulatory networks in 
which a gene and its gene product are involved Here we study the regulatory architecture of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 by applying adaptive 
laboratory evolution (ALE) to metabolic gene KO strains Multi-omic analysis reveal a common overall schema describing the process of adaptation 
whereby perturbations in metabolite concentrations lead regulatory networks to produce suboptimal states, whose function is subsequently altered 
and re-optimized through acquisition of mutations during ALE These results indicate that metabolite levels, through metabolite-transcription factor 
interactions, have a dominant role in determining the function of a multi-scale regulatory architecture that has been molded by evolution

CO-AUTHORS: Tecla Ciociola, Thelma A. Pertinhez, Laura Giovati, Walter Magliani, Alberto Spisni, Luciano Polonelli, Stefania Conti
Microbial metabolomic analysis focused on extracellular and intracellular metabolites can be used for a number of purposes, including species 
identification Currently, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast Metabolome Database is the only one available of fungal metabolites Here we outline 
the metabolic profile of Candida albicans SC5314 in different growth conditions The metabolites of budding and germinating yeast cells were 
analysed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy Yeast cells from semi-synchronized cultures suspended in fresh YPD and 
199 medium were incubated at 30 and 37°C for 1 and 6 h Extracellular metabolites, separated by centrifugation and ultrafiltration, and intracellular 
metabolites, obtained by mechanical cells disruption, were profiled by 1H-NMR on a JEOL 600 MHz ECZ600R and identified and quantified using 
Chenomx NMR suite 76 Distinct metabolic profiles are observed for cells grown in selected conditions Increase in extracellular metabolites is 
observed over time (1 to 6 h) 50 intracellular metabolites were annotated Among the major intracellular metabolites, ethanol, acetate, alanine, 
betaine, and pyruvate, metabolites involved in energy production pathways, were present in different concentrations in budding and germinating 
cells Genes coding for enzymes involved in those metabolic pathways have been confirmed: Candida Genome Database  
(http://wwwcandidagenomeorg) The results obtained, though preliminary, contribute to increase the knowledge of C albicans metabolic profile 
and to create its metabolites database This strategy will allow to unravel the pathways involved in the transition from budding to germinating 
phenotype Characterization of C albicans main metabolic pathways favour the identification of hot spots for new antifungal agents

Exploring the Metabolic Fate of Dietary Polyphenols
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nicola Gray, University of Reading, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Cíntia Rabelo e Paiva Caria, Christine Hinz, Chris Titman, Wagner Vilegas, Glenn Gibson, Gunter Kuhnle
Epidemiological and dietary intervention studies suggest that consumption of polyphenol-rich foods may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease 
Increased intake of polyphenols, found at high levels in tea, fruit and vegetables, has been associated with health-promoting benefits including 
vascular and platelet function, blood pressure and improved plasma lipid profile However, the mechanisms behind these benefits remain unclear, 
and the bioavailability of dietary polyphenols is highly variable between individuals A significant fraction of dietary polyphenols can persist in the 
colon, where they are exposed to the gut microbiota Since the study of the human gut microbiota is hindered by the complexity of this ecosystem 
and accessibility, in vitro gut models provide a powerful tool to build mechanistic knowledge around microbial polyphenol bioconversion 
Combined with metabolomics, this approach enables investigation of broad metabolite perturbations and variations in microbial diversity to 
enhance mechanistic understanding of polyphenol bioactivity and nutritional influences to improve health and reduce risk of CVD through diet 
Here, untargeted and targeted LC-MS metabolite profiling was applied to in vitro gut models from human stool donors in the presence of different 
flavanol-containing substrates to explore polyphenol metabolism and the influence on gut microbial activity Distinct metabolic differences were 
observed in the in vitro culture profiles with the addition of polyphenol substrates in a time dependent manner Targeted phenolic, bile acid and 
short chain fatty acid profiles allowed for a more detailed exploration of gut microbial metabolism, providing an in-depth workflow to determine the 
bioconversion of dietary polyphenol compounds

Semi-targeted analysis of folate metabolites in yeast using ultra-high resolution mass-spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lena Gmelch, Technical University of Munich, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: B. Kanawati, P. Schmitt-Kopplin, M. Rychlik
Folates are a group of vitamins consisting of more than 50 different vitamers These vitamers play an important role in many metabolic processes 
such as methylation reactions, nucleotide synthesis, or oxidation and reduction processes of C1 units A lack in folates is closely associated with the 
incidence of neural tube defects and is assumed to be a major risk factor for several chronic diseases such as cardio vascular diseases or dementia 
Until now, folates are mainly analyzed in the respective monoglutamate forms Little is known so far about the distribution of polyglutamates, which 
are the major vitamer forms in food Thus, it is important to gain deeper insights into the metabolism of folates including its polyglutamylated forms 
Therefore, a semi-targeted FT-ICR-MS approach was conducted to unravel the complete vitamer distribution including metabolic precursors Baker’s 
yeast served as model organism since it is known to be a rich source of folates For obtaining higher sensitivity, sample clean-up via SPE had to be 
performed prior to measurements Several signals could be unraveled as tentative folate vitamers For verification of those compounds, targeted 
analysis by LC-MS/MS using a low resolution triple quadrupole detector was performed The results were in good agreement with FT measurements 
and thus, the assignment could be confirmed To further investigate the folate metabolism, yeast grown in different chemically defined culture media 
was analyzed as described above Differences in the vitamer distribution as well as higher folate contents in media containing methionine could be 
observed as described previously

Development of a Caenorhabditis elegans Reference Material for Long-Term LCMS Metabolomics Quality Control and 
Unknown Compound Identification
PRESENTING AUTHOR: GONCALO GOUVEIA, University of Georgia, United States
CO-AUTHORS: David L. Blum, Alison Morse, Arthur S. Edison, Lauren M. McIntyre
Robust quality assurance/control measures are an essential component of metabolomics studies Creating a biological reference material (BRM) that 
is compliant with six-sigma best practices improves our ability to make inferences from metabolomics experiments However, this is a challenging 
task There are several criteria for a BRM: it should contain features that can be identified on different instruments and platforms and should be able 
to be produced over-time with negligible variation This enables corrections for runs, instruments, and time C elegans cryo-resistance allows for their 
genetic identity to be preserved, making it an ideal BRM Genetically identical batches can be produced from the identical genetic source over-time, a 
primary source of variation in biological systems The other source of variation is in the environment during growth To minimize environmental variance, 
small batches are produced in bioreactors allowing uniform growing conditions and a homogenous batch The largest remaining source of variation is 
the food We have successfully generated a stable C elegans food source (E coli) by ensuring that individual batches are homogenous, combined with 
an adaptation of methods originally developed by “Student” that include small-batch averaging QC for individual batches and small batch averaging 
are common strategies in manufacturing that ensure long-term product consistency We have divided the process into steps: environmental input 
control, batch QC, and batch averaging and developed QC metrics for batch acceptance or rejection before averaging We evaluated our approach by 
measuring metabolites by NMR and our results indicate that that averaged batches can be 9999% concordant

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lyudmila Yanshole, International Tomography Center SB RAS; Novosibirsk State University, Russian Federation
CO-AUTHORS: Ekaterina Zelentsova, Vadim Yanshole, Yuri Tsentalovich
The metabolomic analysis of fish tissues can be successfully used for the study of impact of external factors on the fish health, including water 
contamination with pesticides, herbicides, low oxygen level Changes in the metabolomic compositions of tissues reflect the health status, and 
metabolomic studies helps to elucidate the molecular basis of pathogenesis or the influence of ecological factors For example, a problem of 
extremely high cataract prevalence in farmed salmonids leads to the increase in the metabolomic studies of fish lenses Earlier we developed a 
method for quantitative metabolomic analysis of different tissues and biofluids In this work we applied our approach to the analysis of metabolme 
of roach and pike-perch lenses and gills The quantitative metabolomic profiling of samples has been performed with the combined use of high 
frequency 1H NMR and high-resolution LC–MS methods The concentrations of 60-80 metabolites in fish lenses and gills have been measured 
The most abundant metabolites in the fish lenses are N-acetyl-histidine, N-acetyl-aspartate, serine-phosphoethanolamine and threonine-
phosphoethanolamine These metabolites were attributed to osmolytes Ovothiol A, one of the most powerful antioxidants existing in nature, was 
found in fish lenses in millimolar concentrations The results obtained in the work show high dependence of osmolyte concentration on the season 
- N-acetyl-Histidine predominates in autumn fish lenses, while myo-inositol - in winter lenses This difference may be attributed to the low oxygen 
level in water during the winter season and to the seasonal changes in fish nutrition Supported by RFBR (Projects № 19-04-00092, 18-29-13023)

Plasma metabolomic profiling in chickens under heat stress
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Shozo Tomonaga, Kyoto University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Hirofumi Okuyama, Tetsuya Tachibana, Ryosuke Makino
In the poultry industry, exposure to high ambient temperature induces harmful effects, such as growth retardation, increased mortality, and decreased 
quality and quantity of edible parts (meat and eggs) However, the precise mechanisms underlying physiological and pathophysiological changes 
induced by heat exposure remain unknown To understand the influence from a metabolic perspective, we investigated the effects of exposure to high 
ambient temperature on plasma low-molecular-weight metabolite levels in chickens using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomic 
analysis The heat exposure suppressed growth and food intake Of the 92 metabolites identified, the levels of 29 decreased, whereas the levels of 
9 increased An enrichment analysis using the identified metabolites indicates 35 metabolic processes affected by heat exposure Among them, the 
sulfur amino acid metabolic pathway was clearly detected Changes in the kynurenine pathway in tryptophan metabolism, which could be linked to 
the immune system and oxidative stress, were also observed Among the kynurenine pathway metabolites, we reconfirmed increase of quinolinic acid 
by the quantitative method These results suggest the possible involvement of various metabolic processes in heat-exposed chickens Some of them 
would be important to understand the mechanism of biological responses to high ambient temperature in chickens

The search for novel anthelmintic targets: Characterizing alternative metabolic pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Margot Lautens, University of Toronto, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Samantha Del Borrello, Kathleen Dolan, June Tan, Amy A. Caudy, Andy G. Fraser
Parasitic helminths infect around a quarter of the human population and place a large economic burden on agricultural industries but anthelmintic 
resistance is a growing problem Helminths survive long periods of hypoxia in their hosts, but their anaerobic metabolism has yet to be fully 
characterized These anaerobic metabolic pathways are a promising target for new drugs The goal of this project is to find novel, selective drug 
targets in parasitic helminths by characterizing alternative metabolic pathways in the free-living helminth model, Caenorhabditis elegans Fumarate 
reduction, a rewiring of the TCA cycle, has been previously identified as a major metabolic pathway involved in the survival of Celegans and 
parasitic helminths during hypoxia It relies on rhodoquinone (RQ), absent in helminth hosts RQ-deficient mutants are unable to recover from 
prolonged exposure to the Complex IV inhibitor cyanide (KCN) To test whether KCN induced fumarate reduction, the TCA cycle phenotype of 
RQ-deficient mutants and rotenone-induced Complex I disruption was assayed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and found 
to be similar The metabolomic profiles of chemical and genetic disruption of fumarate reduction, knockout of the hypoxia transcription factor, hif-1, 
and recovery from KCN were interrogated by LC-MS and a computational pipeline developed to allow for metabolite hits to be easily called and 
visualized So far, changes in vitamin and starch metabolism have been identified These pathways will be chemically and/or genetically disrupted 
then subjected to an in-lab imaging assay to determine their importance to KCN recovery and thus their viability as drug targets

Integration of metabolomic approaches in contemporary analysis of bioactive natural products
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Maria Halabalaki, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece
Natural products (NPs) still retain a predominant position among chemical entities since they are characterized by an unmet and untapped structural 
diversity and uniqueness This particular nature is the positive consequence of the evolutionary process, which furnished NPs with competitive 
advantages, enabling them to interact with biological targets for the benefit of every living organism The NPs privileged features have led to their
