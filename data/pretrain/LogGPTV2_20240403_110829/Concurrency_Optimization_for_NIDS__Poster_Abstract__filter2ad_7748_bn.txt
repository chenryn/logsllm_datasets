**Evidence for Streptomyces venezuelae Strains Harboring Potential Anthelvencin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster**

**Presenting Author:** Mira Choi, Korea Basic Science Institute, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Namil Lee, Woori Kim, Byung-Kwan Cho, Kyoung-Soon Jang

**Abstract:**
Secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which encode bioactive compounds such as antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, provide insights into the physiology and evolutionary aspects of Streptomyces species. In this study, we present a highly resolved classification of 25 Streptomyces strains, including ten S. venezuelae strains and 15 other species, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and whole-genome mining. The close relationship between S. venezuelae ATCC 14583, 14584, and 14585 was revealed through MALDI-TOF MS analysis of bacterial protein fingerprints, although these strains did not cluster together in conventional 16S rRNA sequence alignment. Whole-genome sequence alignment using nine publicly available genome sequences of Streptomyces species and three S. venezuelae strains confirmed their phylogenetic relationships, which correlated well with the MALDI-MS results. Additionally, secondary metabolite BGC analysis of the genomes revealed that S. venezuelae ATCC 14583, 14584, and 14585 distinctly shared the congocidine BGC. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate bacterial classification and the discovery of novel secondary BGCs for better utilization of metabolically relevant bacterial species.

**The Metabolism of Oxalate-Rich Leaf Beetles via Gut Bacteria**

**Presenting Author:** Atsuko Miyagi, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Noriyuki Ojima, Wakako Ikeda-Ohtsubo, Maki Kawai-Yamada

**Abstract:**
Rumex obtusifolius is an invasive perennial weed known for its high soluble oxalate content, which can cause mineral deficiencies or renal calculus in humans and vertebrates. However, the oxalate-rich leaf beetle Gastrophysa atrocyanea feeds on R. obtusifolius. To investigate the mechanism of oxalate metabolism in this beetle, we performed metabolomic analysis of G. atrocyanea larvae and adults using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). The results showed that oxalate was not accumulated in either larvae or adults, while other organic acids such as lactate and citrate were highly accumulated. To clarify the role of gut bacteria in oxalate degradation, we measured oxalate and other metabolites in larvae fed with tetracycline-treated R. obtusifolius leaves. The results indicated that oxalate content was significantly higher in larvae fed with tetracycline-treated leaves compared to control leaves. These experiments also suggested that the leaf beetle acquires gut bacteria from its feeding leaves rather than from its parents.

**Contribution of Gut Microbiota to the Metabolism of Dietary Glycine Betaine**

**Presenting Author:** Ville Koistinen, University of Eastern Finland, Finland  
**Co-Authors:** Olli Kärkkäinen, Klaudyna Borewicz, Iman Zarei, Jenna Jokkala, Valérie Micard, Natalia Rosa-Sibakov, Seppo Auriola, Anna-Marja Aura, Hauke Smidt, Kati Hanhineva

**Abstract:**
Mounting evidence supports the protective effect of whole grains against chronic diseases. Simultaneously, our understanding of how gut microbiota influences health and how diet modifies its composition is growing. In this study, we examined C57BL/6J mice fed with bran-enriched diets, conventional and germ-free C57BL/6NTac mice, and the colonic fermentation of rye bran in an in vitro model of the human gastrointestinal system. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics to determine the impact of bran-enriched diets on gut microbial composition and the potential contribution of microbiota to the metabolism of betainized compounds. The bran-enriched diets elevated the levels of betainized compounds in the colon and altered the microbial composition by increasing the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa, including Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Coriobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus, Parasutterella, and Ruminococcus. Germ-free mice had significantly lower levels of betainized compounds compared to conventional mice. In the in vitro model, the production of betainized compounds was observed throughout the incubation, while glycine betaine levels decreased. Only low levels or trace amounts of other betaines were observed in whole-grain cereals. Our findings suggest that the bacterial taxa increased by the bran-based diet are involved in the metabolism of glycine betaine into other betainized compounds, highlighting another group of potential mediators of the synergistic metabolic effect of diet and colonic microbiota.

**Application of High-Throughput Mass Spectrometry Screening to Disentangle the Bacterial Metabolome**

**Presenting Author:** Riya C. Menezes, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Paolina Garbeva, Purva Kulkarni, Aleš Svatoš

**Abstract:**
Bacteria produce a wide array of structurally diverse specialized metabolites with remarkable biological activities. Recent advances in genomic knowledge have revealed that many bacteria have a greater potential to produce secondary metabolites, but this potential is often limited by difficulties in metabolite extraction or non-expression of genes under standard laboratory conditions. Co-cultivation of microorganisms in the same environment can activate cryptic biosynthetic pathways, leading to the production of new metabolites. Advanced analytical methods are essential for the successful detection and identification of co-culture-induced metabolites. In this study, we analyzed the secondary metabolites produced by 12 phylogenetically different bacteria isolated from soil and rhizosphere. Liquid Extraction Surface Analysis (LESA) combined with a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer was used with various solvents. The bacteria were also selectively co-cultured and grown under three different nutrient conditions: nutrient-rich 1/10 TSBA, nutrient-poor Water Agar, and Water Agar supplemented with Artificial Root Exudates. Our results demonstrated that LESA with high-resolution MS is a powerful tool for high-throughput extraction and detection of secondary metabolites produced by different bacteria under different culture conditions. Ethyl acetate/acetone (65:35, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid was the most effective solvent for extraction. Several unknown metabolites were detected in bacterial cultures but not in the controls consisting of only media.

**Mapping the Chemical Diversity Between Mammalian Gut Microbiomes – A Molecular Walk in the Zoo**

**Presenting Author:** Rachel Gregor, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel  
**Co-Authors:** Maraike Probst, Goor Sasson, Stav Eyal, Pieter C. Dorrestein, Michael M. Meijler, Itzhak Mizrahi

**Abstract:**
Studies on the mammalian microbiome have shown that different animal species exhibit wide variations in their microbial compositions, influenced by factors such as diet, digestive strategy, and host phylogeny. Despite this taxonomic diversity, a key metagenomics study indicated functional redundancy, suggesting that the functional capabilities of these microbial communities are similar, although certain functions are enriched based on diet. Here, we propose to characterize the metabolic content of mammalian microbiomes as a direct window into ecosystem function. We conducted comprehensive metabolomics analyses on 101 mammalian fecal samples and 34 dietary samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for semi-polar metabolites and lipids, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for primary metabolites, and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for short-chain fatty acids. Metabolites were identified using an in-house library of standards and further explored using the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS; gnps.ucsd.edu) to assign putative structures and group compounds into chemical families based on fragmentation patterns. The microbiome of the fecal samples was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found a strong correspondence between the animals' microbiomes and metabolomes (Mantel test: 0.703; significance: 0.001), as well as the association of certain chemical families with different animal groups. We are currently examining how this effect differs for different classes of metabolites and correlating specific metabolites with microbial species to better elucidate the metabolic capabilities of these communities and their ecological functions.

**Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantification of Intracellular Metabolites**

**Presenting Author:** Reza Maleki Seifar, DSM, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Lucien Duchateau, Maurien Olsthoorn

**Abstract:**
Accurate quantitative data on intracellular metabolites from industrial cell cultures are crucial for metabolic engineering studies aimed at producing useful chemicals. Key considerations in the quantitative analysis of intracellular metabolites include the short turnover time of some metabolites, continued metabolism of microorganisms at the time of sampling, leakage of intracellular metabolites, interferences from extracellular environments, and extraction efficiencies. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS(MS)) is widely used in metabolomics studies. For absolute quantification, access to standard chemicals and stable isotope-labeled internal standards is necessary. Internal standards are required to correct for losses during extraction and matrix effects in MS-based quantitative analysis. Fully 13C-labeled internal standards, produced by microorganisms cultured on 13C-fully labeled glucose as the exclusive carbon source, are ideal for this purpose. Here, we present a method for the quantitative analysis of metabolites from the mevalonate and isoprenoid pathways using fully 13C-labeled internal standards, including sampling, quenching, extraction, and LC-MS/MS analysis.

**Evolution of Gene Knockout Strains of E. coli Reveals Regulatory Architectures Governed by Metabolism**

**Presenting Author:** Douglas McCloskey, Biosustain, DTU, Denmark  
**Co-Authors:** Sibei Xu, Troy E. Sandberg, Elizabeth Brunk, Ying Hefner, Richard Szubin, Adam M. Feist, Bernhard O. Palsson

**Abstract:**
Biological regulatory network architectures are multi-scale in function and can adaptively acquire new functions. Gene knockout (KO) experiments are a well-established approach for studying gene function and unraveling regulatory networks. In this study, we applied adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to metabolic gene KO strains of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 to study the regulatory architecture. Multi-omic analysis revealed a common schema describing the adaptation process, where perturbations in metabolite concentrations lead to suboptimal states, which are subsequently re-optimized through the acquisition of mutations during ALE. These results indicate that metabolite levels, through metabolite-transcription factor interactions, play a dominant role in determining the function of a multi-scale regulatory architecture shaped by evolution.

**Metabolic Profiling of Candida albicans**

**Presenting Author:** Alberto Spisni, University of Parma, Italy  
**Co-Authors:** Tecla Ciociola, Thelma A. Pertinhez, Laura Giovati, Walter Magliani, Luciano Polonelli, Stefania Conti

**Abstract:**
Microbial metabolomic analysis, focusing on both extracellular and intracellular metabolites, can be used for various purposes, including species identification. Currently, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast Metabolome Database is the only available database for fungal metabolites. Here, we outline the metabolic profile of Candida albicans SC5314 under different growth conditions. The metabolites of budding and germinating yeast cells were analyzed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy. Yeast cells from semi-synchronized cultures suspended in fresh YPD and 199 medium were incubated at 30 and 37°C for 1 and 6 hours. Extracellular metabolites, separated by centrifugation and ultrafiltration, and intracellular metabolites, obtained by mechanical cell disruption, were profiled by 1H-NMR on a JEOL 600 MHz ECZ600R and identified and quantified using Chenomx NMR Suite 7.6. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed for cells grown under different conditions. An increase in extracellular metabolites was observed over time (1 to 6 hours). Fifty intracellular metabolites were annotated, with ethanol, acetate, alanine, betaine, and pyruvate, involved in energy production pathways, present in different concentrations in budding and germinating cells. Genes coding for enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways were confirmed using the Candida Genome Database (http://www.candidagenome.org). These preliminary results contribute to our understanding of the C. albicans metabolic profile and the creation of its metabolite database. This strategy will help unravel the pathways involved in the transition from budding to germinating phenotypes and identify hot spots for new antifungal agents.

**Exploring the Metabolic Fate of Dietary Polyphenols**

**Presenting Author:** Nicola Gray, University of Reading, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** Cíntia Rabelo e Paiva Caria, Christine Hinz, Chris Titman, Wagner Vilegas, Glenn Gibson, Gunter Kuhnle

**Abstract:**
Epidemiological and dietary intervention studies suggest that the consumption of polyphenol-rich foods may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Increased intake of polyphenols, found at high levels in tea, fruit, and vegetables, has been associated with health-promoting benefits, including improved vascular and platelet function, blood pressure, and plasma lipid profiles. However, the mechanisms behind these benefits remain unclear, and the bioavailability of dietary polyphenols is highly variable between individuals. A significant fraction of dietary polyphenols persists in the colon, where they are exposed to the gut microbiota. In vitro gut models provide a powerful tool to build mechanistic knowledge around microbial polyphenol bioconversion. Combined with metabolomics, this approach enables the investigation of broad metabolite perturbations and variations in microbial diversity, enhancing our understanding of polyphenol bioactivity and nutritional influences. In this study, untargeted and targeted LC-MS metabolite profiling was applied to in vitro gut models from human stool donors in the presence of different flavanol-containing substrates to explore polyphenol metabolism and the influence on gut microbial activity. Distinct metabolic differences were observed in the in vitro culture profiles with the addition of polyphenol substrates in a time-dependent manner. Targeted phenolic, bile acid, and short-chain fatty acid profiles provided a detailed exploration of gut microbial metabolism, offering an in-depth workflow to determine the bioconversion of dietary polyphenol compounds.

**Semi-Targeted Analysis of Folate Metabolites in Yeast Using Ultra-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry**

**Presenting Author:** Lena Gmelch, Technical University of Munich, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** B. Kanawati, P. Schmitt-Kopplin, M. Rychlik

**Abstract:**
Folates are a group of vitamins consisting of more than 50 different vitamers, playing crucial roles in methylation reactions, nucleotide synthesis, and oxidation-reduction processes of C1 units. A deficiency in folates is associated with neural tube defects and is a risk factor for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and dementia. While folates are typically analyzed in their monoglutamate forms, little is known about the distribution of polyglutamates, which are the major vitamer forms in food. To gain deeper insights into folate metabolism, including its polyglutamylated forms, we conducted a semi-targeted Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) approach. Baker's yeast served as a model organism due to its high folate content. Sample clean-up via solid-phase extraction (SPE) was performed to enhance sensitivity. Several signals were tentatively identified as folate vitamers. For verification, targeted analysis by LC-MS/MS using a low-resolution triple quadrupole detector was performed, confirming the assignments. To further investigate folate metabolism, yeast grown in different chemically defined culture media was analyzed. Differences in vitamer distribution and higher folate contents in media containing methionine were observed, consistent with previous findings.

**Development of a Caenorhabditis elegans Reference Material for Long-Term LC-MS Metabolomics Quality Control and Unknown Compound Identification**

**Presenting Author:** Gonçalo Gouveia, University of Georgia, United States  
**Co-Authors:** David L. Blum, Alison Morse, Arthur S. Edison, Lauren M. McIntyre

**Abstract:**
Robust quality assurance and control measures are essential in metabolomics studies. Creating a biological reference material (BRM) compliant with six-sigma best practices improves our ability to make inferences from metabolomics experiments. However, this is a challenging task. A BRM should contain features identifiable on different instruments and platforms and be reproducibly produced over time with minimal variation. C. elegans, due to its cryo-resistance, is an ideal BRM. Genetically identical batches can be produced from the same genetic source, reducing biological variation. Environmental variance is minimized by producing small batches in bioreactors, ensuring uniform growing conditions and a homogenous batch. The largest remaining source of variation is the food. We successfully generated a stable C. elegans food source (E. coli) by ensuring homogeneity and adapting methods originally developed by "Student" that include small-batch averaging. QC metrics for batch acceptance or rejection before averaging were developed. We evaluated our approach by measuring metabolites using NMR, and our results indicate that averaged batches can be 99.99% concordant.

**Metabolomes of Sander lucioperca and Rutilus rutilus lacustris Gills and Lenses**

**Presenting Author:** Lyudmila Yanshole, International Tomography Center SB RAS; Novosibirsk State University, Russian Federation  
**Co-Authors:** Ekaterina Zelentsova, Vadim Yanshole, Yuri Tsentalovich

**Abstract:**
Metabolomic analysis of fish tissues can be used to study the impact of external factors on fish health, including water contamination with pesticides, herbicides, and low oxygen levels. Changes in the metabolomic composition of tissues reflect the health status and help elucidate the molecular basis of pathogenesis or the influence of ecological factors. For example, the high prevalence of cataracts in farmed salmonids has led to increased metabolomic studies of fish lenses. We previously developed a method for quantitative metabolomic analysis of different tissues and biofluids. In this work, we applied our approach to the analysis of the metabolome of roach and pike-perch lenses and gills. Quantitative metabolomic profiling was performed using high-frequency 1H NMR and high-resolution LC-MS. The concentrations of 60-80 metabolites in fish lenses and gills were measured. The most abundant metabolites in fish lenses were N-acetyl-histidine, N-acetyl-aspartate, serine-phosphoethanolamine, and threonine-phosphoethanolamine, attributed to osmolytes. Ovothiol A, a powerful antioxidant, was found in fish lenses in millimolar concentrations. The results show a high dependence of osmolyte concentration on the season, with N-acetyl-histidine predominating in autumn and myo-inositol in winter. This difference may be attributed to the low oxygen level in water during the winter season and seasonal changes in fish nutrition. This work was supported by RFBR (Projects № 19-04-00092, 18-29-13023).

**Plasma Metabolomic Profiling in Chickens Under Heat Stress**

**Presenting Author:** Shozo Tomonaga, Kyoto University, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Hirofumi Okuyama, Tetsuya Tachibana, Ryosuke Makino

**Abstract:**
In the poultry industry, exposure to high ambient temperatures can induce harmful effects such as growth retardation, increased mortality, and decreased quality and quantity of edible parts (meat and eggs). However, the precise mechanisms underlying these physiological and pathophysiological changes remain unclear. To understand the influence from a metabolic perspective, we investigated the effects of heat exposure on plasma low-molecular-weight metabolite levels in chickens using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolomic analysis. Heat exposure suppressed growth and food intake. Of the 92 metabolites identified, the levels of 29 decreased, while the levels of 9 increased. Enrichment analysis using the identified metabolites indicated 35 metabolic processes affected by heat exposure, with the sulfur amino acid metabolic pathway being clearly detected. Changes in the kynurenine pathway in tryptophan metabolism, linked to the immune system and oxidative stress, were also observed. Among the kynurenine pathway metabolites, we reconfirmed the increase in quinolinic acid using a quantitative method. These results suggest the involvement of various metabolic processes in heat-exposed chickens, some of which are important for understanding the biological responses to high ambient temperatures.

**The Search for Novel Anthelmintic Targets: Characterizing Alternative Metabolic Pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans**

**Presenting Author:** Margot Lautens, University of Toronto, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Samantha Del Borrello, Kathleen Dolan, June Tan, Amy A. Caudy, Andy G. Fraser

**Abstract:**
Parasitic helminths infect around a quarter of the human population and place a large economic burden on agricultural industries, but anthelmintic resistance is a growing problem. Helminths survive long periods of hypoxia in their hosts, but their anaerobic metabolism is not fully characterized. These anaerobic metabolic pathways are promising targets for new drugs. The goal of this project is to find novel, selective drug targets in parasitic helminths by characterizing alternative metabolic pathways in the free-living helminth model, Caenorhabditis elegans. Fumarate reduction, a rewiring of the TCA cycle, has been identified as a major metabolic pathway involved in the survival of C. elegans and parasitic helminths during hypoxia. This pathway relies on rhodoquinone (RQ), absent in helminth hosts. RQ-deficient mutants cannot recover from prolonged exposure to the Complex IV inhibitor cyanide (KCN). To test whether KCN induced fumarate reduction, the TCA cycle phenotype of RQ-deficient mutants and rotenone-induced Complex I disruption was assayed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and found to be similar. The metabolomic profiles of chemical and genetic disruption of fumarate reduction, knockout of the hypoxia transcription factor hif-1, and recovery from KCN were interrogated by LC-MS and a computational pipeline was developed to call and visualize metabolite hits. Changes in vitamin and starch metabolism have been identified. These pathways will be chemically and/or genetically disrupted and subjected to an in-lab imaging assay to determine their importance to KCN recovery and their viability as drug targets.
