Figure 3 illustrates the required capacities C, computed
with DNC and SNC, for the questions Q1 in (a) and Q2 in
(b). Note that (a) clearly shows the (conventional) multi-
plexing gain when b = 3r. Note also that the multiplexing
gain kicks-in around ten ﬂows. In turn, (b) illustrates that
there is no distributed multiplexing gain when there is only
one cross ﬂow N = 1; however, for suﬃciently large N , e.g.,
50, the conventional multiplexing gain kicks-in and compen-
sates for the lack of distributed multiplexing gain.

Network calculus (NC) has seen a lot of research over the
last 20 years, e.g., Google Scholar yields ≈ 3000 hits when
searching for “network calculus”, comparing relatively well
to its ‘older brother’ queueing theory, which yields ≈ 60000
hits. The broad perception on NC is that it holds good
promises as an alternative/complementary methodology to
classical queueing theory. Yet, in the camp of NC researchers
as well as the larger audience, the mood somewhat oscillates
between “Hooray, we found the Holy Grail!” and “Oh no, it’s
not gonna work.” In this paper, we have tried to better lo-
cate where the truth stands and aimed at reducing the level
of confusion—and hopefully not creating new one—by clar-
ifying some important issues related to the core modelling
abstractions in network calculus: arrival envelopes and ser-
vice processes. On this mission, we also provided some new
insights into network calculus in the larger frame of things.
Speciﬁcally, we collected the following facts:
• NC is about approximating a complex (typically non-
linear) queueing system by a min-plus linear one. The
approximation closely follows the traces of both tradi-
tional LTI system theory and of elementary properties
from classical queueing theory; the analogy is good,
but not perfect.
• With respect to arrival envelopes we provided a num-
ber of pitfalls as well as advice on how to avoid them.
The most salient and profound observation is that the
S3BB envelope model presented at ACM Sigcomm 2006
delivers quasi-deterministic performance bounds for a
large class of arrivals (stationary and ergodic), which
means that it cannot generally capture statistical mul-
tiplexing gain.
• Statistical multiplexing gain can be captured well by
SNC, under carefully deﬁned envelope and service pro-
cesses.
In particular, for the application scenario of
multiplexing independent regulated arrival processes,
we rigorously showed the gain to be on the order of
Ω(√N ), which before had only been shown approxi-
mately. So there is light at the end of the tunnel and
hopefully it is not by a train railing towards us.
• We have also discussed on the tightness of bounds,
a lingering issue surrounding almost any discussion on
NC. We clariﬁed issues about the tightness of the DNC
and provided insights into that of SNC. In short, DNC
generally delivers tight bounds, i.e., the bounds can be
attained; SNC is as tight as the underlying probability
inequalities being used (Boole, Chernoﬀ, martingale
inequalities). As these inequalities can be plugged into
SNC in a modular fashion, one may argue that the
SNC analysis can be made as tight as the state-of-the-
art in probability theory allows.
Summing up, while using NC does not provide us with
a free lunch, it still seems to be of good value in analyzing
traditionally hard fundamental queueing problems due to its
scalable tradeoﬀ between accuracy and ease of analysis.
