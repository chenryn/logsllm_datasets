This bug concerns the `cmd/go` tool providing a more informative error message when an invalid `GOOS/GOARCH` pair is specified.

For context, see the confusion reported in issue #11908. Additionally, there is a related request in issue #12270. If we address this bug, it would be prudent to also resolve the related issue using a consistent and reliable source of truth for `GOOS` and `GOARCH` validation.
