##### Detailed description
I have used the Facenet code to train a model and get .ckpt and .meta files.
(https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet). I used freeze_graph.py from
tensorflow to get a .pb file from this, and then used the steps here
(https://medium.com/@dibyaranjan.sathua/how-to-use-tensorflow-graph-with-
opencv-dnn-module-3bbeeb4920c5) to optimize the model.  
Now I've tried calling it in tf_inception.cpp from CV dnn samples, just to see
if model would load.
My model throws error as
    batch_join/fifo_queue:FIFOQueueV2
    shared_name:[ ]
    shapes:[ ]
    container:[ ]
    component_types:[ ]
    capacity:[ ]
    OpenCV(3.4.1) Error: Unspecified error (Unknown layer type FIFOQueueV2 in op batch_join/fifo_queue) in cv::dnn::experimental_dnn_v4::`anonymous-namespace'::TFImporter::populateNet, file C:\build\master_winpack-build-win64-vc14\opencv\modules\dnn\src\tensorflow\tf_importer.cpp, line 1582
How do I solve this?
=> Is it because the training code has FIFOQueueV2 as part of input pipeline,
and CV doesn't recognize it?  
=> Am I using the wrong .cpp file to call model?  
=> would there be something wrong with my .pb file?
thanks!
