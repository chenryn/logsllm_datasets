After upgrading to next 6.0.0, when running Next in dev mode, page transitions
sometimes get stuck rendering the current page rather than rendering the next
page.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
When clicking a `` in dev mode, after the page bundle builds, the
client should navigate to the linked page.
The behavior is inconsistent and I have not been able to reproduce this issue
when the page is already built.
## Current Behavior
After the next page bundle builds, the client re-renders the current page.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Run next in dev mode (I am using a custom Express server, so the `dev` command is `node server.js`
  2. Go to a page in the browser
  3. Click a `` to second page
  4. Wait a bit for the second page to build
  5. The browser location changes to the second page's url, but you're still on the first page
Refreshing the page renders the second page correctly.
## Context
This is preventing us from upgrading to Next 6.0.0
