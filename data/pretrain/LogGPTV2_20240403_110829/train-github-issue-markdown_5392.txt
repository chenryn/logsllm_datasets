**Bootstrap: affix.js v3.1.1 Issue and Proposed Fix**

In the current version of `affix.js` (v3.1.1), there is an issue where the "position" property is not reset when you scroll back up after reaching the bottom of the page (unpin). Specifically, the "position" system is set when you scroll to the bottom, but it is not unset when you scroll back up.

To address this, I modified the following code:

```javascript
if (this.unpin) {
  this.$element.css('top', '');
}
```

to:

```javascript
if (this.unpin) {
  this.$element.css('top', '').css('position', '');
}
```

This change ensures that both the `top` and `position` properties are reset when unpinning. However, I am unsure if this is a robust solution or if it might be considered a bit of a hack. Any feedback or suggestions for a more elegant fix would be appreciated.
