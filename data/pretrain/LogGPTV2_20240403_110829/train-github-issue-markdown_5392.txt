Bootstrap: affix.js v3.1.1
When you scroll to the bottom, the "position" system is set. But it is not
"unset" when you scroll back up (unpin).
I fixed the problem by changing:
. if (this.unpin) this.$element.css('top', '')
...to...
if (this.unpin) this.$element.css('top', '').css('position', '')
Dunno if this is a good "fix" or a bit of a hack.
