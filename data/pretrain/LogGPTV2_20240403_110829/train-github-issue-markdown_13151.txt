    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    Compile & run the code in:
      https://gist.github.com/ernestokarim/5033404
    It cannot be reproduced in the playground because it needs sqlite3.
    What is the expected output?
    Run without bugs.
    What do you see instead?
    Using any revision after this one:
      https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=ddb9e6365e57
    it starts to consume file descriptors without end, you can check it:
      while [ 1 ] ; do ls /proc/6559/fd | wc -l ; sleep 1; done
    even if I'm closing the prepared statements correctly. In the iteration 1021 it fails
    with "unable to open database file".
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    8g.
    Which operating system are you using?
    Fedora 17, 32 bits. SQLite3, the latest version from the website.
    Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')
    go version devel +c0258d9a3589 Wed Feb 27 15:22:14 2013 -0800 linux/386
