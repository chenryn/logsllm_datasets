validated as soon as they are generated, and periodically during storage. Virtual 
machines and networks can significantly help with validating backups to ensure no 
loss of data has occurred; another technique is to compare bit-by-bit the data 
contained on two identical backup media stored in two separate physical locations. 
Backup restoration is required if there is a compromising event on a device, if the 
system is not functioning or if the system is suffering from data corruption. A 
restoration will only be as good as the backup used, this is why backups are 
validated; only validated backups should be used to restore a system, redesign is 
required if data is compromised and there is no validated backup. 
Maintenance, Hardware and Physical Security Hardening 
No modems should be allowed “period”. Disable physical Ethernet, USB, serial 
and proprietary protocol connections when not in use. This can be achieved either 
physically or via software. Ensure the computer is housed in a locked 6-wall cabinet 
in a 6-walled room.  Ideally, the computer enclosure should be industrial grade with 
cylinder locks. Hardware redundancy is highly recommended and actually very 
common in plants today.  Hot swappable devices will make maintenance easier. 
Remove unused hardware. 
System Maintenance should be performed via automated scheduling on a 
periodic basis to reduce clutter (and attack surface) and maintain performance. This 
should include, but is not limited to: registry cleaning, disk cleanup and 
defragmentation. The order should be maintained to maximize system maintenance 
effectiveness.

Many of the requirements in controlling electronic access to devices inside an ESP 
and protecting devices within an ESP are endemic in physical security as well. A lot of 
the overlap has been eliminated in this section, instead trying to focus on the 
differences. The subjects are closely related, and cannot be completely separated. This 
section is dedicated to strongly securing access points to physical security perimeters 
and securing physical devices. Electronic security without physical security is not an 
option for reasons that should be obvious to the reader. 
4.4.3.1. Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs) 
PSPs will be used to segment the plant and will be critical in planting security 
controls. All access points must be identified and protected appropriately. It is 
extremely important, for an effective defense-in-depth approach, that PSPs are defined 
in a layered approach. Generally, primary and secondary will suffice, tertiary PSPs can 
be used in special circumstances.  
The primary PSP should comprehensively encompass the entire plant, all PSPs. 
The access points to a primary PSP are the first line of defense against local attacks, 
whether physical or cyber, and are by far the most important to protect.  Access points 
should be minimized with only one point for personnel, one or two points for fuel and 
other material deliveries.  Access points to a primary PSP deserve somewhat 
excessive protection mechanisms.  Cameras, RFID or SSD preferably, guards, sign-in 
sheets, plant contact confirmation and  ID verification should all be part of the access 
process. 
Access points to discrete secondary PSPs, a door to a room within the plant, 
deserve robust and effective controls. RFID has proven to be highly insecure; as a 
result, if RFID is used, two factor authentication should be required.  
One special circumstance that may warrant the use of tertiary PSPs are the access 
points to the main control rooms. Often plant operators resist the use of locking access 
systems and login requirements, and for good reason. If there is an emergency, 
operators need to get where they need to be and access the things they need to 
access.  In addition, plant operators cannot be expected to bear the cost of security 
related overhead. A solution is the use of cameras monitoring the access points to two 
layered PSPs within the plant. During normal operation, security personnel can identify 
people entering the control room and unlock the 2nd entry point remotely. During a 
plant emergency, the doors should be hardwired to unlock and to fail open. Of course, 
plant operators should have a failsafe unlocking mechanism in the control room. There 
is a trade off related to physical security, between overburdening users or being overly 
invasive and being well protected.  A balance needs to be achieved.

4.4.3.2. Protection of PSP Access Points 
Various methods and tools are discussed in the following section. Remember, to 
always vary the use of tools and vendors across the primary PSP and secondary PSPs 
to make the plant more resistant to local attacks. 
A. Limiting access to the Primary PSP via a DMZ 
The DMZ limits, controls and monitors all access to any part of the operating plant. 
The DMZ usually takes the form of a gatehouse and surrounding barbed wired fence, 
followed by a long stretch of open area, followed by the actual plant. The idea of a 
physical DMZ is to give security staff time to respond to an unauthorized entry before 
the individual actual reaches the plant. Cameras monitoring the DMZ should be well 
placed, hidden and secured somehow (height, mounting the camera high without an 
access ladder, has proven to be an effective defense tactic).  
After the accessing individual passes through the DMZ he should be allowed to 
access the plant using authentication or a security device, but preferably both. If the 
individual has not been to the plant before, he should be escorted for safety reasons.  
B. Limiting access between Secondary PSPs 
Physical access to any secondary PSP through any access point should only be 
permitted using two factor authentication.  Log all access events. Monitor, detect, and 
alarm all attempts and actual unauthorized access events continuously and 
electronically when practical. Provide remote locking mechanisms and an effective 
method to assess any situation. Be sure to protect all access points. All level 1, 2 and 3 
cyber devices will need to be housed in secondary PSPs whether it is an enclosure or a 
room. 
C. Limiting access between Devices and/or Tertiary PSPs 
An example of a somewhat unidentified tertiary PSP could be locked cabinets 
between DCS modules, which are all usually lumped together inside a secure room or 
secondary PSP. Tertiary PSPs should only be defined for highest risk cyber devices 
and will need to be tailored to each system. No more discussion is provided. 
D. Devices used for the Access, Control and Monitoring of ESPs & PSPs 
In-depth discussion of how to secure physical access control devices is outside the 
scope of this paper and somewhat poorly documented. However, these systems need 
to be well protected and typically are classified as level 2 or 3 cyber devices, depending 
on how the organization decides to interpret the questions. These devices do deserve 
well thought-out and somewhat clever security strategies.

4.4.3.3. Protection of cyber devices 
When determining how to physically protect cyber devices, classifications can play a 
key role. The classifications outlined in section  4.4.1 are intended for large industrial 
facilities.  When security controls are applied, apply them in a layered approach but try 
to maintain some continuity at each layer. 
A. Applying protections to devices 
When applying physical protections to devices, they should be grouped in some 
fashion, for example, to allow the entire DCS system to be in locked cabinets inside a 
secure room. As many devices as is possible should be included by default, including 
devices that happen to be nearby. Generally speaking all plant level 1, 2 and 3 PCs 
and Servers will need to be in a locked room and/or cabinet.  Ideally, these devices 
should have enclosure locks. Network switches are often unlocked; this is a mistake. 
Lock all level 1, 2 and 3 network switches in a locked cabinet at a minimum and close 
all unused ports, preferably with a physical and virtual lock. Printers should either be 
locked in a room (which is usually impractical) or secured in a larger facility, such as a 
secured office complex, and put in a high traffic area so workers can detect suspicious 
activity.  All PLCs regardless of the level need to be locked inside an enclosure and, 
whenever possible, inside a secured room. All recorders, relays and similar Ethernet 
devices should have some form of physical security.  Currently, most do not and there 
are not many solutions available. All devices used for access control and monitoring of 
PSPs and ESPs need physical protections. 
B. Physical Hardening 
The goal of physical security hardening is to mitigate the chances of a local attack 
by simple visible deterrents such as guard stations, barbed wire and security camera, 
to delay any impending attack with layered controls and strategies, and to strengthen or 
put mechanisms in place that will log and monitor access attempts and detect, alter and 
notify any attempts at unauthorized access or actual unauthorized access incidences. 
Generally, one should only have to harden a room or enclosure once in the life of a 
plant, assuming it was secured and maintained. If the device is ever locally 
compromised successfully, the device should be redesigned to mitigate the risks 
associated with the same attack occurring twice. When deciding how to harden PSPs, 
the tradeoff between functionality and access and good security should be considered 
in the design. For example, authorized personnel should not be overly hindered by 
physical security obstacles in case of emergencies yet systems still need to be 
secured. 
A prerequisite of physical security hardening is that all devices within the PSP must 
be identified and all unauthorized or unjustifiable devices be removed. Asset 
management software can be used to track this data. The PSP needs to be as secure

as possible, often by using a well built 6 walled structure or a solid metal enclosure. 
Hardening an insecure room is pointless. 
Area/Device Targets 
Physical hardening targets may include rooms, enclosures, cabinets, control rooms, 
panels, etc; these are definitely not the only devices that need to be physically 
hardened, but they are devices that must not be missed.  Whatever targets are chosen, 
realize that each class of targets presents unique design challenges. 
Device classifications previously developed combined with area vulnerability 
estimates can play a key role in determining the order in which targets should be 
addressed and how much effort should be put into hardening them. These things need 
to be well thought out.  It is similar to what the U.S. military did for planes during World 
War II. All planes returning from war would be inspected for bullet holes. If any bullet 
holes were found, they knew statistically that that particular spot on the plane did not 
require armoring (i.e. hardening), since the plane took the hit and made it back alive. 
For industrial control systems, the data set is not the same, however, the same 
principle applies, and data can be generated based on a theoretical worst case 
scenario, total system failure. 
Ideally, a physical security engineer should be designing the system or perhaps an 
engineer with significant security experience with assistance from high level security 
personnel. These projects are not short lived or uncomplicated by any means; 
Speaking only in terms of orders of magnitude, a large power plant can have: 
• Upwards of 50 computer or DCS rooms. 
• Upwards of 50 PLC enclosures scattered throughout the plant, often unsecured. 
• Visible wire ways, cable trays, conduits, etc. that are an easy target with little 
cost effective solution for remediation. 
• Upwards of 100 HMIs scattered through the plant floor, often unsecured.  
• A few dedicate server rooms for controlling access between the plant and other 
networks; ideally, these should be controlled by the plant, not by administrators 
of the other networks. 
• Usually, there is one main control room for a single unit or two units sharing one 
control room, separated by a dividing line. 
It is a pretty big project to physically harden the entire plant, and this is with the 
assumption that the physical structures (walls, rooms, etc)  are built well enough to 
thwart or delay direct physical assault on the structure or segment the consequences of 
explosions, whether caused by accident or incident.

Subject Matters of Hardening Efforts 
Subjects of hardening any particular target may include, but are not limited to: 
• Security devices (locks and keys, cameras, intrusion detection systems, etc) 
• Target hardening (deterring or delaying an attack focusing on a target area or 
target device) 
• Hardening security for sensitive chemicals 
• Damage mitigation (segmenting against physical attacks) 
• Access point management(logging all authorized access and deterring, 
monitoring, alerting and responding to unauthorized access attempts) 
• Environmental hardening (Lighting and inherent access deterrents) 
• Security personnel policies (guard houses, patrols, etc.) 
• Social engineering mitigation (control communications, training, etc.) 
Each subject matter presents unique design challenges and will be discussed in the 
following paragraphs. 
Security devices  
Locks are acceptable devices to be used in adhering to physical protection 
requirements to assist in controlling access to areas, facilities, and materials through 
doors, gates, container lids, and similar material or personnel access points, and are 
considered essential components of a physical barrier. Locks may take a number of 
forms, some more secure than others; even considering a completely mechanical lock, 
ease of compromise varies greatly. 
Mechanical locks are not “manipulation proof" and are either combination locks, key 
operated or electrically operated. These classes of locks are broken down into further 
subdivisions, considering design and construction factors. Studies about the security of 
mechanical locks have been done for centuries and are outside the scope of this paper. 
Magnetic locks are also typically encountered in certain facilities, but are not 
recommend because they usually fail open.  
Cameras and microphones are critical to confirming an incident or identifying access 
by unauthorized individuals. It is highly recommended that all cameras installed be the 
pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) type unless used for access control via facial recognition. The 
placing of cameras needs to be well thought out, considering whether or not the 
camera should be placed in a visible location as a deterrent, or hidden as an incidence 
recorder.  Consideration should also be given to the security of the cameras, as 
discussed in section  4.4.3.3. The most cost effective method to monitor and respond to 
camera output is to put the system under the control of the primary PSP guardhouse, 
however, a second location internal to the plant is highly recommended. Camera 
outputs should be recorded and stored for a minimum of three months, but preferably 
longer.  If an attack plan long in the making occurs, perhaps planned over the course of

a year, a longer retention period may prove useful in analyzing and reporting the attack. 
Redundant hard drive storage is the preferable method for storing security footage.  
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) should be used in conjunction with locks to deter, 
detect and alert and alarm unauthorized access attempts. IDSs use sensors to detect a 
change in an environment, processors to interpret the change, and output modules to 
alarm in case of incident detection. Sensors vary from motion detectors (e.g. electric 
field, infrared, microwave, laser, etc) to vibration or strain detectors; some systems 
even use cameras for face contour recognition. Alarms can be silent, auditory, or visual 
in most cases.  
Additional examples of security devices include ID reader and access systems, 
biometric identification devices, keypads, tokens, or even remotely operated mantrap 
systems. Appropriate selection and placement of security devices is key to protecting 
the plant, and a full analysis and design process should be followed. The following are 
additional recommended sources to assist with the selection and placement of security 
devices:

the protection and control of facilities and special nuclear materials”. 
• U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Regulatory Guide 5.44, “Perimeter Intrusion 
Alarm Systems”.

Target hardening & Damage mitigation 
Target hardening is a term mainly used by high level physical security experts or 
counter terrorism agents. Its goal is to deter or delay an attack focusing on a target 
area or a target device. Target hardening usually involves visible defenses for deterring 
potential attacks. Physical target hardening is usually analogous to surface area 
reduction for electronic devices previously discussed in section  4.4.2.3 B. In regards to 
a power plant, target hardening should involve implementing security controls and 
strengthening physical structures for an area or device for the purposes of mitigating or 
segmenting any damage caused by local attacks. 
Hardening security for sensitive chemicals 
Power plants often use toxic or chemically explosive substances, which are required 
by plant systems. Large quantities of these substances are on site, often in giant tanks 
inappropriately located within the DMZ (i.e. accessible without entry into the primary 
PSP or plant). Some of these substances are already controlled under environmental 
protection laws, but often with little to no consideration for physical and/or electronic 
Industrial Cyber Security: From the Perspective of the Power Sector                                Page 50 of 65

security. For example, urea and ammonia is used in large quantities for pollution 
control in fossil plants and is extremely explosion when mixed with nitrate. Other 
chemicals that are toxic can be released killing people (examples of non-cyber related 
incidents would be the Bhopal disaster or the Halifax explosion). Whenever possible, 
tanks containing potentially explosive or toxic chemicals should be housed within a 6 
walled enclosure.  Usually, placement within the plant is sufficient if the primary PSP is 
well controlled. 
The NRC limits maximum amount of fissile material and “special nuclear material” 
(SNM) allowed on site, and regulates specific requirement for how all material is stored 
and handled; see U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Regulatory Guide 5.42, “Design 
considerations for minimizing residual holdup of special nuclear material in equipment 
for dry process operations”. It should be noted that there is currently a bit of over 
exaggerated fear related to the consequences of a nuclear plant compromise (i.e. a 
nuclear explosion). An attack who’s aim is to cause a nuclear explosion with the 
material on site would fail; the material has not been enriched to the needed level to 
obtain critical mass, so it would effectively take a hydrogen bomb (which would be a 
much larger explosion to worry about) to cause a cascading reaction. Also, the theft of 
nuclear material simply isn’t feasible; a nuclear fuel assembly weighs between 700 and 
1,500 pounds16
, and all material housed on site whether in the reactor or in fuel storage 
is not easily moved due to the radiation hazards (at least for the next 100 years). There 
is vulnerability during fuel loading, but most of the risks associated with this have 
already been mitigated and the process is well controlled nationally. 
Access point management 
As already discussed and repeated here for effect, all access points to primary and 
secondary, and certain tertiary, PSPs should monitor and log all access attempts 
continuously (24/7) and electronically to avoid human error. Devices used for this 
purpose must be able to effectively detect, alert, alarm, notify and often react to 
attempts at and actual unauthorized access attempts. This is called access point 
management and the tools necessary to accomplish these goals have already been 
discussed in previous sections. Two factor authentication, as discussed previously, is 
always recommended. 
Environment hardening 
Environment hardening is the process of strengthening everything that is common to
