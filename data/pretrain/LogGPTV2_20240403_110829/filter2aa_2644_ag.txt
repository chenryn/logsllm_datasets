### Validation and Storage of Backups
Backups should be validated immediately upon generation and periodically during storage. Virtual machines and networks can significantly aid in this validation process, ensuring that no data loss has occurred. Another effective technique is to perform a bit-by-bit comparison of the data on two identical backup media stored in separate physical locations.

### Restoration of Backups
Restoration of backups is necessary in cases of device compromise, system failure, or data corruption. The quality of the restoration depends entirely on the integrity of the backup. Therefore, only validated backups should be used for restoration. If data is compromised and there are no validated backups, a redesign of the backup strategy is required.

### Maintenance, Hardware, and Physical Security Hardening
- **Modems and Connections:** No modems should be allowed. Physical Ethernet, USB, serial, and proprietary protocol connections should be disabled when not in use, either physically or via software.
- **Physical Security:** Ensure that the computer is housed in a locked 6-walled cabinet within a 6-walled room. The enclosure should ideally be industrial-grade with cylinder locks.
- **Hardware Redundancy:** Highly recommended and common in modern plants, hot-swappable devices can facilitate easier maintenance.
- **Unused Hardware:** Remove any unused hardware to reduce clutter and potential attack surfaces.

### System Maintenance
System maintenance should be performed on a periodic, automated schedule to reduce clutter and maintain performance. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Registry cleaning
- Disk cleanup
- Defragmentation

The order of these tasks should be maintained to maximize the effectiveness of system maintenance.

### Physical Security Controls and Measures
#### 4.4.3. Physical Security Controls and Measures
Many requirements for controlling electronic access to devices and protecting them within an Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) also apply to physical security. This section focuses on the differences and highlights the importance of integrating both types of security. Electronic security without physical security is not sufficient, as it leaves significant vulnerabilities.

#### 4.4.3.1. Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs)
PSPs are used to segment the plant and are critical for implementing security controls. All access points must be identified and protected appropriately. A layered approach is essential for an effective defense-in-depth strategy, typically involving primary and secondary PSPs, with tertiary PSPs used in special circumstances.

- **Primary PSP:** Encompasses the entire plant and is the first line of defense against local attacks. Access points should be minimized, with one point for personnel and one or two for material deliveries. Excessive protection mechanisms, such as cameras, RFID or SSD, guards, sign-in sheets, and ID verification, should be employed.
- **Secondary PSPs:** Access points to discrete areas within the plant, such as rooms, should have robust controls. If RFID is used, two-factor authentication is recommended.
- **Tertiary PSPs:** Special circumstances, such as access points to main control rooms, may warrant additional layers. During emergencies, doors should be hardwired to unlock and fail open, with a failsafe unlocking mechanism available in the control room.

#### 4.4.3.2. Protection of PSP Access Points
Various methods and tools are discussed to protect PSP access points. It is important to vary the use of tools and vendors across different PSPs to enhance security.

- **A. Limiting Access to the Primary PSP via a DMZ:**
  - The DMZ limits, controls, and monitors all access to the operating plant. It typically includes a gatehouse, barbed wire fence, and a long stretch of open area.
  - Cameras should be well-placed and hidden, and all access should be authenticated using security devices or both.
  - New visitors should be escorted for safety.

- **B. Limiting Access Between Secondary PSPs:**
  - Access to secondary PSPs should require two-factor authentication. All access events should be logged and monitored continuously.
  - Remote locking mechanisms and effective methods for assessing situations should be provided.

- **C. Limiting Access Between Devices and/or Tertiary PSPs:**
  - Tertiary PSPs, such as locked cabinets between DCS modules, should be defined for high-risk cyber devices.

- **D. Devices Used for Access, Control, and Monitoring of ESPs & PSPs:**
  - These systems need to be well-protected and typically classified as level 2 or 3 cyber devices. They require well-thought-out and clever security strategies.

#### 4.4.3.3. Protection of Cyber Devices
When determining how to physically protect cyber devices, classifications play a key role. Security controls should be applied in a layered approach with continuity at each layer.

- **A. Applying Protections to Devices:**
  - Group devices, such as the entire DCS system, in locked cabinets inside secure rooms.
  - Lock all network switches and close unused ports. Printers should be secured in high-traffic areas.
  - All PLCs, recorders, relays, and similar Ethernet devices should have physical security.

- **B. Physical Hardening:**
  - The goal is to mitigate local attacks through visible deterrents, delay tactics, and monitoring systems.
  - Identify and remove unauthorized devices within the PSP.
  - Use asset management software to track devices and ensure the PSP is as secure as possible.

#### Subject Matters of Hardening Efforts
- **Security Devices:** Include locks, cameras, intrusion detection systems, and other access control mechanisms.
- **Target Hardening:** Focus on deterring or delaying attacks on specific areas or devices.
- **Hardening Security for Sensitive Chemicals:** Ensure tanks containing potentially explosive or toxic chemicals are housed within secure enclosures.
- **Access Point Management:** Monitor and log all access attempts continuously and electronically.
- **Environmental Hardening:** Strengthen common elements to deter and delay attacks.

Each subject matter presents unique design challenges and requires careful consideration and planning.
