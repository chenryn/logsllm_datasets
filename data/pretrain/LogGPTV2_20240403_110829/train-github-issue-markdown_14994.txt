SmallVec is a versatile collection designed to store a small, fixed number of elements directly on the stack. If the number of elements exceeds this fixed capacity, SmallVec seamlessly transitions to using heap-allocated memory, similar to a `Vec`.

[@aturon](https://github.com/aturon) has expressed interest in incorporating SmallVec, or a similar implementation, into the `libcollections` library.
