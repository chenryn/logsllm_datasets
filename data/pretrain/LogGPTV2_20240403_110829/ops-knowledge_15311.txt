User: I'm looking for libpython2.6.dylib in my frameworks folder but for all my instals I can only find the libpython2.7.dylib. 
I'm looking in 'System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.x'/lib . 
I also notice that libpython2.7.dylib is actually just an alias for '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python', does this mean i can just make my own alias of the other 'Python' binaries that are on all the install directories?
Assistant: On a Mac, it is stored under /usr/lib
