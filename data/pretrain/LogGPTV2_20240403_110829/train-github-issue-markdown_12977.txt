Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

As we all know, the `render` function in React returns an HTML-like structure. The issue I'm encountering is that when I type a space after the `return` keyword and then connect the HTML fragment, there is no problem. However, if I press Enter to create a new line and then connect the HTML fragment, I receive the following error: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getNativeNode' of null`.

I also came across this explanation:
> Currently, in a component's `render` method, you can only return a single node. If you need to return multiple elements, such as a list of `div` elements, you must wrap them in a single parent element, such as a `div`, `span`, or any other valid component.
>
> Remember that JSX compiles into regular JavaScript. Returning two separate elements without a wrapping parent does not make syntactic sense. Similarly, do not include more than one child in a ternary expression.

Given this, how should I understand and resolve this problem?
