User:  How to install the MySQL database and configure user permissions under the Linux system?
Assistant: 1. Install the MySQL database Under the Linux system, you can install MySQL through the package manager such as apt-get, yum, etc. Take the Ubuntu system as an example, run the following command to install MySQL: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install mysql-server ``` During the installation process, you will be prompted to enter the password of the root user. After setting the password, the MySQL installation can be completed . 2. Configure the permissions of the MySQL administrator user. The MySQL administrator user is the root user and has the highest authority. Generally, for security reasons, it is not recommended to use the root user in common business operations. In MySQL, the GRANT command can be used to authorize users to have corresponding permissions in the database. Use the following command to log in to MySQL: ``` sudo mysql -u root -p ``` Enter the root user password to enter the MySQL console. Create a new user and assign permissions: ``` CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; ``` Among them, newuser is the username of the new user, and password is the password of the new user. The above command will create a new user and grant permissions to all databases and tables to the user. The FLUSH PRIVILEGES command is necessary to reload the system privilege table so that the modification takes effect immediately. If you need to revoke the privileges of a user, you can use the REVOKE command: ``` REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* FROM 'user'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; ``` The above command will revoke 'user'@'localhost' User permissions on all databases and all tables. Note that the FLUSH PRIVILEGES command should also be used to make it take effect immediately after revoking the privilege. 3. Configure MySQL remote access permissions By default, MySQL can only be accessed locally. If you need to access MySQL from a remote computer, some additional configuration is required. On the MySQL server, open the MySQL configuration file /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf, find the following: ``` bind-address = 127.0.0.1 ``` Change it to: ``` bind-address = 0.0.0.0 ``` This allows access to the MySQL server from any IP address. In MySQL, you can enable remote access permissions for specified users: ``` GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; ``` Among them, % means Any IP address is allowed to access the MySQL server. root and password are the username and password of the MySQL administrator respectively. Then, restart the MySQL service: ``` sudo service mysql restart ``` In this way, you can access the MySQL server from a remote computer. Of course, you must pay attention to security issues when enabling remote access permissions.
