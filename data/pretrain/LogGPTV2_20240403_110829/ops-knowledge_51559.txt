User: I have a launchd entry that worked with OSX 10.6 but that fails with 10.7.  It uses python, and it produces an error whilst trying to import serial.  I don't quite understand this, because I've re-downloaded pyserial-2.5 and re-installed it with sudo.  (In desperation, I re-installed it for each of the many flavours of python on my machine.)  As a test, I can enter python and do import serial without difficulties.  Maybe there is a system path that is set up well for an interactive user, that is not set up for launched??
Can anyone suggest how I might diagnose the problem?
Assistant: The path you are appending:
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages
is the site-packages directory for a third-party, non-system Python, possibly installed using a python.org installer, and not that of the Apple-supplied system Python 2.7, which would be:
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages
So most likely you are using the python.org Python to install pyserial but are launching the system Python under launchd.  Check your shell PATH (echo $PATH), it probably has:
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin
in it. And try which python.  If you want to use the python.org Python with your launchd plist, modify it to use an absolute path to the right Python, for instance:
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
If you want to install pyserial with the system supplied Python, you can use an absolute path to it when doing the install:
/usr/bin/python2.7
