User: I have a batch file that runs a python script. I am running Python 3.2. I want to send a variable like an integer or string from the python script back to the batch file, is this possible?
I know I can accept command line arguments in the Python script with sys.argv. Was hoping there was some feature that allows me to do the reverse.
Assistant: You can't "send" a string. You can print it out and have the calling process capture it, but you can only directly return numbers from 0 through 255.
