Routing works like:
    wallet_read:
      path: /wallet/{id}.{_format}
Would be nice to have that a bit more intelligent like
    wallet_read:
      path: /wallet/{wallet.id}/{wallet.title}.{_format}
So that URL generator like in Twig receive the entity and does the rest of the
magic:
    path('wallet_show', {wallet: wallet})
How about that?
