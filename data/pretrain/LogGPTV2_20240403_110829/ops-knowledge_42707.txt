User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Analyze the following logs
 0 04:30:31 Info 00000005 Creating NT transaction (seq 1), objectname [6]"(null)"
 1 00:00:46 Info 00000005 Creating NT transaction (seq 1), objectname [6]"(null)"
 2 04:40:54 Info 0000000d Creating NT transaction (seq 2), objectname [6]"(null)"
 3 02:03:49 Info Failed to internally open package. [HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE]
 4 02:03:49 Info Failed to internally open package. [HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE]
 5 04:30:33 Info Failed to internally open package. [HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE]
 6 04:30:33 Info Failed to internally open package. [HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE]
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Loaded Servicing Stack <*> with Core: <*>\cbscore.dll 和 Ending TrustedInstaller initialization.
B: Loaded Servicing Stack <*> with Core: <*>\cbscore.dll 和 SQM: Initializing online with Windows opt-in: False
C: <*>@<*>/<*>/<*>:<*>:<*>:<*>.<*> WcpInitialize (wcp.dll version <*>) called (stack @<*>) 和 SQM: Initializing online with Windows opt-in: False
D: <*> Creating NT transaction (seq <*>), objectname [<*>]"(null)" 和 Failed to internally open package. [HRESULT = <*> - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE]
