Hi,
I know the Context is flagged as an experimental feature hence why it is
missing from the Top-Level API but I find myself having to pass context to a
legacy-compatible component.
    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(DialogComponent, {id: id, component: this.component, childProps: this.props}), document.getElementById(id));
`React.createElement()` does not allow for context setting and this is causing
me to 'hack' a context in these cases by doing something like
    componentWillMount: function() {
            this.context = this.props.context;
        },
in a mixin.
Is it something that could be looked into?
Thanks!!
