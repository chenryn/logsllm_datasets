# MEATPISTOL: A Modular Malware Implant Framework

## Presented by: @ceyxies and @fzzynop

### Overview
MEATPISTOL is a modular malware implant framework designed for Red Team operations. It enables the creation, management, and interaction with stealthy implants that support persistent adversarial activities.

### Red Team Operating Paradigm
- **Scope**: Any systems, humans, or processes employed by the company. #Yoloscope
- **Rules of Engagement**: We choose the targets, set the rules, and take as much time as necessary. #NoScopeBias
- **Objective**: Conduct realistic operations, avoid detection, and achieve the mission by any means necessary.
- **Impact**: Deliver results to large audiences, conduct branded operations, and craft propaganda.

### Origin Story
Upon starting a new job, the directive was clear:
- "Go hack stuff."
- "Make an impact."
- "Don’t get caught."
- "Shell yeah."

Initially, the approach was to find and use existing malware. However, all the decent malware was for Windows, leading to the development of custom tools.

#### Snail
- **Description**: A Python-based reverse SSH tunneling tool.
- **Features**:
  - Lexicon-based C2 resolution.
  - Cron job or LaunchDaemon persistence.
  - Random scheduling.
  - Obfuscation.
  - Generator script.
- **Outcome**: Worked well for about a year.

### Challenges
- **Blue Team Resistance**: Blue teams were not fond of being compromised by Python-based malware.
- **Specific Defenses**: Blue teams implemented specific defenses against Red Team tactics.
- **Skill Asymmetry**: The Red Team's skills improved, but their ability to be a credible threat decreased.
- **Code Quality**: The codebase became spaghetti code, making maintenance difficult.

### Iteration and New Tools
- **Fully Implemented SSH Client and Server in Java**
- **Rio**: Another SSH reverse tunneling tool written entirely in Bash.

These new tools provided new capabilities, but the process remained cumbersome and error-prone.

### Pain Points
- **Reinventing the Wheel**: Rewriting malware each time for new features.
- **C2 Management**: Setting up and managing C2 infrastructure manually.
- **Key Management**: Managing keys and certificates for each C2 server.
- **Errors and Inconsistencies**:
  - Accidentally resetting a C2.
  - Connecting to the wrong C2 from the wrong place.
  - Broken shells and connections.
  - Reusing the same certificate across multiple C2s.

### Vision for Improvement
Wouldn't it be nice if:
- You didn't have to write things from scratch every time?
- Creating a new malware implant took seconds?
- You could pick the features you wanted for the implant?
- C2 server infrastructure spun up automatically?
- Each sample and C2 endpoint was unique?
- You didn’t have to manage keys for each C2 server?
- The malware was just super freaking awesome?

### MEATPISTOL: The Solution
#### Core Architecture
- **Microkernel**: Provides the mechanism to communicate with the C2.
- **Event Loop**: Manages events and schedules tasks.
- **Scheduler Loop**: Handles task scheduling.
- **Execution Core**: Executes tasks and manages the overall flow.

#### Modules
- **C2 Module**: Registers with the core on startup and listens for C2 connect and disconnect events.
- **Persistence Module**: Ensures the implant remains active.
- **File Module**: Manages file operations.
- **Loot Module**: Collects and exfiltrates data.
- **Exec Module**: Executes commands.
- **Hide Module**: Conceals the implant’s presence.

#### Communication
- **Client to Client**: Uni-directional, persistent communication.
- **Many Reader, Many Writer**: Supports multiple readers and writers.
- **Channel Operations**: Read, Write, Attach, Detach, Close.

### Network Architecture
- **CHANNEL**: Facilitates communication between different components.
- **NETWORK ARCHITECTURE**: Designed for efficient and secure communication.

### Demo Time
- **Alpha Version**: Ready for testing and feedback.

### Comparison with Other Tools
- **Not an Exploit Database**: Unlike Metasploit.
- **Not Click-to-Win**: Unlike Cobalt Strike.
- **Not a Post-Exploitation Agent**: Unlike Empire Project.
- **Not a Bag of Cool Tricks**: Unlike Fuzzbunch.

### What is MEATPISTOL?
- **A Framework for Red Teams**: To create better implants.
- **Multi-User Implant Management**: Portal for managing and interacting with implants.
- **Offensive Infrastructure Automation Tool**: Saves time and reduces pain.

### Conclusion
MEATPISTOL is now available for your use. #SOON
