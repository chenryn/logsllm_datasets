The following behavior is observed in versions `0.15.0rc1-21-g32c5016` and `0.14.1` of the library. When a `label` passed to the `drop` method of a `Series` is not present in the index, the behavior varies based on the nature of the index:

1. **If the index does not consist entirely of boolean values:**
   - An error is raised, indicating that the label is not contained in the axis.
   
2. **If the index consists entirely of boolean values and has a length greater than 1:**
   - No error is raised, and the original series is returned.

3. **If the index consists entirely of boolean values and has a length of exactly 1:**
   - An error is raised, indicating that the label is not contained in the axis.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Documentation:**
   - The difference in behavior between cases (a) and (b) should be clearly documented to avoid confusion.

2. **Behavioral Change:**
   - The behavior in case (c) should be changed to match that in case (b). Specifically, if the index consists entirely of boolean values and has a length of 1, no error should be raised, and the original series should be returned.

### Examples of Current Behavior

**Case (a):**
```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 1], index=['a', True]).drop(False)
ValueError: labels [False] not contained in axis
```

**Case (b):**
```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 1], index=[True, True]).drop(False)
True    1
True    1
dtype: int64
```

**Case (c):**
```python
>>> pd.Series([1], index=[True]).drop(False)
ValueError: labels [False] not contained in axis
```

By implementing these changes, the behavior of the `drop` method will be more consistent and predictable, and users will have a clearer understanding of how the method operates with different types of indices.
