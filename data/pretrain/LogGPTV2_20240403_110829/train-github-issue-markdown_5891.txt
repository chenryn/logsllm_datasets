The behaviour below occurs in versions `'0.15.0rc1-21-g32c5016'` and
`'0.14.1'`.
When the `label` passed to the `drop` method of a `Series` is not in the
index:  
(a) if the index is not all booleans then an error is raised  
(b) if the index is all booleans and has length > 1 then no error is raised;
the original series is returned  
(c) if the index is all booleans and has length == 1 then an error is raised
I propose that:
  1. the difference between the behaviour in (a) and (b) should be documented
  2. the behaviour in (c) should be changed to match that in (b)
Examples of current behaviour:  
(a)
    >>> pd.Series([1, 1], index=['a', True]).drop(False)
    ValueError: labels [False] not contained in axis
(b)
    >>> pd.Series([1, 1], index=[True, True]).drop(False)
    True    1
    True    1
    dtype: int64
(c)
    >>> pd.Series([1], index=[True]).drop(False)
    ValueError: labels [False] not contained in axis
