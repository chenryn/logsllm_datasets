### Anonymization Plan for Sensitive Tickets

To address the potential sensitivity or embarrassment associated with certain tickets, we implemented an anonymization plan as part of our Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol. This plan involves the removal of personally identifiable information (PII) using pattern matching and name lists to redact names, addresses, titles, numbers, and other identifiers. While this method is effective, it is not without its limitations, including false positives and false negatives. Whenever we encountered a ticket that still contained PII, we paused our analysis, removed the PII, and then resumed. In any reported quotes where PII has been redacted, we use the marker “[PII]” to indicate the redaction.

### Timeline of Unique User IDs and Login Frequency Distribution

**Figure 1: Timeline of Unique User IDs Aggregated Daily and Monthly and the Distribution of Login Frequency Per User**

- **Daily Unique User IDs**: The timeline shows high usage during workdays with periodic dips on weekends and university holidays. UCB provided a full year of logs, while UIUC provided nine months of logs.
- **Login Frequency Per User**: A log was generated each time a user successfully or unsuccessfully completed a two-factor authentication (2FA) ceremony, which was always preceded by a successful password authentication. The user base increased as more personnel were required to use 2FA and new individuals joined the organization. Steeper upward trends, consistent with the gradual 2FA rollout at both institutions, are visible in late 2018.

### Baseline Authentication Behavior

The observed 2FA patterns are closely tied to existing traditional authentication patterns. To assess the generalizability of our findings, we compared our data with studies of traditional authentication patterns. 

- **Daily and Monthly Unique Users**: On an average workday, about 20,000 out of 78,000 users at UIUC and 40,000 out of 105,000 users at UCB log in. The monthly aggregation shows the forced adoption curve of 2FA as the number of active users increases.
- **Re-authentication Patterns**: Users at UCB re-authenticate several times per day, while users at UIUC typically authenticate every few days. Approximately 35% of users at UIUC and 20% of users at UCB log in less than once a month.

### Systemic Usability of 2FA Deployment

Understanding the baseline authentication behavior, we next measured the user burden associated with 2FA deployments. We asked how much time users should expect to spend on 2FA and investigated the theoretical and observed benefits of device remembrance.

#### Time Taken by Authentications

- **User Time Spent on 2FA**: While individual 2FA ceremonies may be quick, the total time over a year can be significant. Based on our analysis, the average user spends tens of minutes per year or less on these 2FA systems. However, a subset of users authenticates far more frequently.
- **Estimation Method**: We estimated the time by counting the total number of 2FA authentications and dividing them by the type of second factor used per person. We then used empirical timing estimates from Reese et al. [28] and Lang et al. [19] to calculate the total user time required for millions of authentications per year.

**Table 1: Estimated User Time Spent Authenticating**

| 2nd Factor Type | App Push | Phone Call | SMS/Code | U2F/Yubikey | Total |
|-----------------|----------|------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Time (s)        | 11.8     | 20.8       | 18.4     | 9.7         | -     |
| Count UIUC      | 2,884,875| 865,559    | 1,688,161| 204,489     | -     |
| Count UCB       | 5,967,112| 1,272,396  | 1,970,448| 11,820.0 hrs| 6,251.3 hrs |

#### Device Remembrance

One potential mitigation to reduce user burden is to remember trusted devices on which a successful 2FA has recently taken place. We compared the effects of different device remembrance policies at UIUC and UCB.

- **UCB Policy**: With a 30-day remembrance policy, 70% of logins at UCB were remembered, saving tens of thousands of hours of user time. This policy saved approximately 80,000 person-hours per year, equating to a yearly indirect cost savings of $400,000 to $600,000 for an organization with 100,000 users.
- **UIUC Policy**: UIUC had no device remembrance, leading to higher user burden. The usability benefit was not uniform across users, with 80% of UCB users benefiting from the "Remember Me" feature.

**Figure 3: Ideal vs. Actual Remember Me at UCB**

- **Simulation Results**: We simulated the ideal effects of a "Remember Me" feature for different lengths on six months of 2FA login data from UCB. The results show that increasing the device remembrance timeout decreases user load, but the benefit scales inversely with the timeout period.

#### Errors in 2FA Ceremonies

We observed that more than one in twenty 2FA ceremonies did not end successfully. This was concerning because logs were created only after a user successfully entered their username and password.

- **Error Rates**: Figure 4 shows the distribution of error rates per user. At UIUC, 60% of users experienced 1 to 100 errors, while 40% saw no errors. At UCB, 75% of users experienced between 1 and 100 errors, and 20% of users did not experience errors.
- **Error Causes**: The highest error rate was due to users canceling or abandoning their interaction, followed by entering invalid passcodes.

**Table 2: Reasons for Failure and Affected 2nd Factors**

| Failure Cause              | Count UIUC | Fraction UIUC | Count UCB | Fraction UCB |
|----------------------------|------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| User Canceled              | 87,676     | 19.22%        | 558,562   | 48.19%       |

| Anomalous Push             | 0          | 0.00%         | 77,176    | 6.66%        |

| User Mistake               | 24,293     | 5.33%         | 15,300    | 1.32%        |
| Locked Out                 | 1,671      | 0.37%         | 3,357     | 0.29%        |
| Call Timed Out             | 1,394      | 0.31%         | 753       | 0.06%        |
| User Marked Fraud          | 0          | 0.00%         | 1,797     | 0.16%        |
| Misc Invalid Request       | 52         | 0.01%         | 165       | 0.01%        |
| Total                      | 487,676    | 100.00%       | 1,159,842 | 100.00%      |

#### Recovery Time from Failure

To understand how much time users spend locked out when experiencing errors, we measured the time between an authentication failure and the next successful attempt.

- **Recovery Time**: We defined the recovery time as the difference between the timestamp of a failed 2FA attempt and the next subsequent successful login. Figure 5 shows the mean and median recovery times per fraction of users.

**Figure 5: CDF of User Error Recovery Times**

- **Results**: The graph shows the mean and median error recovery time per fraction of users. The overall lesser error counts at UIUC may be due to the lack of device remembrance, leading to more frequent logins.

By addressing these aspects, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the systemic usability of 2FA deployments and the factors that influence user burden and satisfaction.
