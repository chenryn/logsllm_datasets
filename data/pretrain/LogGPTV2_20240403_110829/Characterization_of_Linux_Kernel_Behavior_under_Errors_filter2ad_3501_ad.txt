Error results in truncating the file size to 0. No crash is observed, but on reboot, init reports: error 
while loading shared libraries: /lib/i686/libc.so.6 file too short.
Error makes the kernel reuse the page (inside the swap area), which is in use. 
fs: generic_commit_write() 
Error reduces the inode size (inode->isize).
mm: do_generic_file_read() 
Undetected error of an incomplete read of the file (data or executable) to the cache page.
