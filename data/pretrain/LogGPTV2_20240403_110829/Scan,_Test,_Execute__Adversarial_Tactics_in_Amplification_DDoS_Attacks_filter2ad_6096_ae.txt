which can be used by an adversary to minimize the bandwidth re-
quired for a successful attack. We observed that several adversaries
do not launch their attacks as continuous floods but instead adopt
a pulsing behavior of floods followed by brief inactive periods. This
would have the advantage of reducing the risk of “burning” the am-
plifiers due to continuous usage while still meeting the objective.
Figure 12 shows this behavior for one such attack, with multiple
waves of flooding. When we observe pulses, their behavior was

highly coordinated, as we observe all honeypots used in the attack
simultaneously receiving traffic and simultaneously stop receiving
requests. We would expect sophisticated actors to perform these
types of attacks, and we indeed find for all pulse attacks that they
are exclusively conducted using only high amplification devices.
6 DDOS ATTACK CAMPAIGNS
One of the most important arguments for investigating attacks
along the DDoS attack chain presented in this paper is that adver-
saries will likely reuse components from a previous attack. Instead
of finding infrastructure, testing it, and weaponizing every time a
victim is being targeted, attackers would instead use the same set
of servers, attack packets, etc., to perform multiple attacks.
Actors have a geographical focus. When multiple attacks use
the same servers in our system, the probability of this occurring
due to random selection of two different entities is negligible given
the number of active honeypots. We use this as the first feature to
cluster attacks, where we cluster attacks if these are using the same
set of our amplifiers. We do not link attack instances if they have
all honeypots of a particular kind in common – such as all NTP
high amplification services –, as specific preferences of adversaries
might result in multiple actors sharing these edge cases. From the
720,995 attack flows, we obtain 749 clusters of attacks, of which
351 attacks more than once. To verify if the same actor indeed per-
forms the attacks inside a cluster, we use three criteria: (1) The at-
tacks are performed using the same request packet. (2) The attacks
use the same strategy in picking the source port. (3) The flows in-
side the cluster have the same characteristics in, for example, puls-
ing and intensity. Amazingly, all of the 351 clusters attacking more
than once match these criteria and will therefore be considered in
this section as being valid clusters. Figure 13 shows the distribu-
tion of targeted countries by the clusters attacking more than 100
separate IP addresses. We see actors show a significant degree of
geographical specialization. While previous work locates the bulk
of DDoS activity to the US and China [13], we find it much more
nuanced from an actor perspective, which focuses and specializes
on victims in a handful of countries. This shows that attacks are
not randomly carried out but are aimed at an objective from the ad-
versary; for example, NTP clusters 4, 5, and 6, which solely target

ing a large number of attacks using only fake high amplification
servers. On inspection of these clusters, we find that these attackers
are not using the correct protocol specification and do not receive
replies from the real servers. However, the adversaries do select the
servers that provide the highest amplification. Additionally, we find
a significant negative correlation (p < .01) between the fake servers
used in an attack and the amplification ratio, hinting that advanced
adversaries are actively filtering out these obvious honeypots. This
behavior is curiously only present in NTP and SSDP abuse, while ad-
versaries targeting DNS, RIP, or QOTD do not seem to care how they
achieve their objective. Surprisingly, the adversaries that perform
highly targeted scans towards single cloud zones are not the sophis-
ticated attackers as the adversaries actively removing poorly behav-
ing amplification servers are also evaluating the entire ecosystem
and use amplification servers hosted in multiple cloud locations.
Sophisticated attackers do not show advanced behavior across
the entire spectrum but innovate only selectively. To better
understand how adversaries work, the steps they take can be sep-
arated into different phases. Table 7 shows a mapping for seven
clusters performing attacks using our amplification honeypots on
the model shown in figure 1. Looking at the entire chain of activi-
ties rather than only the separate phases, we find that clusters per-
forming longer-lasting attacks are more likely to use servers with a
higher amplification factor, indicating that attackers capable of per-
forming long-lasting DDoS attacks are making more effort to en-
sure their operation is successful. But there is no relation between
the duration or amplification factors in attacks and whether or not
the adversaries use our obvious honeypots. However, we find evi-
dence that adversaries capable of performing large attacks are cu-
rating the set of amplifiers, whereas adversaries that only perform
lower volume and duration attacks are using their amplifier lists for
weeks without checking whether these systems are still online. Clus-
ters performing long-lasting attacks with high amplification such
as cluster #1 and #7, which perform attacks lasting over 2 hours,
are continuously curating and updating their amplifier lists by con-
tinuously scanning the servers used in the attacks and are thus
not active anymore after the active phase of our experiment con-
cludes, as their continuous curation prevents them from using a non-
responsive server in an attack. While we have seen many attacks
being performed weeks after the infrastructure did not respond
to attacks anymore, these attacks are almost exclusively under 10
minutes and do not care about the amplification ratio provided by
a server. The actors capable of performing high-volume and high-
duration attacks are thus test servers for their amplification ratio
and weed out unresponsive servers before performing an attack.
7 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
Investigating the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used in DDoS
attacks may change the way we organize our defenses. By looking
at the entire DDoS attack chain with the model presented in this
paper, we show that the ecosystem of DDoS amplification is more
than a collection of individual attacks but that it is possible to cor-
relate and link them based on solid behavioral features. The results
show the presence of hundreds of actors with different sophistica-
tion, preferences for attack vectors and victims, and unique modus

Turkey identify that the objective of these adversaries is different
from other clusters. As discussed in section 5.3 attacks are often
performed during the afternoon or evening at the location of the
victim. As most attackers are biased towards certain countries, we
would expect these actors to have distinct attack timings as well.
From the 86 (25%) clusters performing attacks over multiple days,
we indeed observe 68 (19%) showing a diurnal pattern, where the
number of attacks drops significantly during certain hours. The re-
maining 18 (5%) clusters are not significantly lowering their activ-
ity in a day/night rhythm and might be an indication of automated
booter services that are used by people in multiple countries.
Sophisticated actors reuse the same servers often. As all the
individual attacks within a cluster use the same attack packet, with
identical traffic dynamics and from the same (randomly chosen)
source port, they can be attributed to the same setup by the adver-
sary. Within clusters, all attacks are performed using the same com-
mand. For an attacker, this makes sense, as the attacker knows that
the request sent to the server is amplified based on previous scan re-
sults. When we look at the volume of the attacks originating from a
cluster and the way they select our honeypot infrastructure, we find
an astonishing rich spectrum of behaviors. Figure 14 shows for each
of the clusters the volume of attacks through the size of the market
and on the x- and the y-axis the percentage of fake and high ampli-
fication honeypots that were used during the attacks. As clusters
also showed the behavior of selecting the same set of amplification
servers, these data points are not averages but static over time. Much
of the clusters congregate in the middle of the graph, distributed
around the expected values for the ratio of fake servers and high am-
plification devices an attacker would use based on a random selec-
tion, such as an indiscriminate scan of the Internet. Deviations to the
left mean that the adversary is performing some post-processing to
weed out suspicious devices, shifting to the top an active selection
to maximize the attack volume. As we see in the graph, the more
attacks an attacker performs, the stronger it will pre-select for high
amplification servers and discard low-utility devices. The more at-
tacks an attacker performs, the higher the likelihood to identify and
discard unusually behaving servers from the attack list. Thus, the
most extensive campaigns tend to be run by the more sophisticated
adversaries. We indeed find a significant positive correlation (p <
.05) between the number of attacks in a cluster and the amplification
ratio, as well as a significant negative correlation (p < .01) with the

ing DDoS attacks, some degree of attribution for attacks is possible.
Although a significant share of DDoS appears as ‘dumb”, ‘script-
kiddie”-driven activity, our study reveals the presence of sophisti-
cated actors who investigate, inspect and measure services on the
Internet and perform active selection to maximize their return-on-
investment. This means that future research on DDoS and the In-
ternet threat landscape has to account for such adversarial behav-
ior and needs to advance in terms of techniques, as obvious decoys
or servers not participating in test attacks that are currently be-
ing used in research would be discarded by sophisticated actors.
This would result in a drastically biased perspective on the DDoS
ecosystem. By using actual services and through momentary but
ethical participation when rallied, we were the first to show this un-
explored dimension of the threat landscape and demonstrate that
ethical investigation of this behavior is feasible.
In this study, we deployed an order of magnitude more honeypots
than any previous works, first to allow for systematic and statisti-
cally significant testing of different scenarios and configurations,
but second because the heterogeneity of the ecosystem would oth-
erwise lead to biased results from the overrepresentation of select
actor groups. We also identify the need for rigid methods in separat-
ing malicious scanning activity from research scan activity to avoid
large measurement biases. Using the technique from [27], we can
show that 3-10 times as many honeypots are necessary to capture
the richness of the threat landscape as were deployed in previous
work, as shown in figure 4. To deal with such temporal biases and
ecosystem heterogeneity, we advocate that future studies should
deploy honeypots in the hundreds, not dozens, to be effective.
Accomplishing this deployment scale also has drawbacks, and in
this study, we limit our experiments for monetary reasons to a sig-
nificantly shorter online duration. While smaller honeypot studies
operated for several months or even years [17, 27, 32], our system
was deployed for three months, from which actively responding for
three weeks. This limited-time might influence the number of adver-
saries using our systems and would not show those actors who enter
the ecosystem only at longer spaced intervals. Finally, our study de-
ployed honeypots within the IP ranges of cloud providers. Although
