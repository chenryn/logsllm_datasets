GET request to an API returned a response with broken encoding.  
More specifically, the response body was encoded in ASCII even though the data
sent via API is encoded in UTF-8.  
The result is escaped non-ASCII characters in the response body.  
This behaviour can be observed on r.content, r.text, and r.json().
Following the quickstart guide, I tried to "force encoding" with `r.encoding =
'UTF-8'` but it had no effect.  
I made sure to include `charset=UTF-8` in request header, which also didn't
help.
What ended up working was `json.loads(r.text)`.
Very simple I know, but locating the problem was difficult,  
not to mention I had to be absolutely sure the API was sending a data that was
encoded in UTF-8.  
This problem is not mentioned or, at least, not easily found on Stackoverflow.  
I thought I would mention it here, so that others can find it.
issue #5577 seems to be similar in nature, which only proves that Encoding is
an issue that seems to pop up every now and then.  
The answer given for that issue seems to be "there is an easy solution so
there's no need to fix it on our ends".  
But nonetheless, a bug is a bug.  
Besides, it would be nice to mention how to troubleshoot encoding on the
quickstart guide.
Sorry it's not so much of a "summary", but things had to be said.
## Expected Result
A response body properly encoded in UTF-8.  
Like so, `{'body': '상품등록'}`
## Actual Result
A response body encoded in ASCII even though it's supposed to be UTF-8.  
`{'body': '\uc0c1\ud488\ub4f1\ub85'}`
## Reproduction Steps
    import requests
    url = 'https://www.sorryicannottellyoutheactualapi.com/api'
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8'}
    r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    print(r.content)
    print(r.text)
    print(r.json())
