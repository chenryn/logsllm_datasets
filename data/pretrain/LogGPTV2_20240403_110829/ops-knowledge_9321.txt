User: What are the Pro's and Con's of using win32api for I/O and other things instead of simply Python, if both have a specific function for it
I mean, using PyWin32 vs Win32Api
Assistant: con

(lack of) portability
harder/more error prone

pro

performance (potentially, it must be measured, as will depend on more than just the api calls)
