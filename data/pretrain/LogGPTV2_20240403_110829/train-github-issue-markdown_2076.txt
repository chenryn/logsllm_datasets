I have a simple class that extends another where ViewChild is defined in the
parent class and the component defined in the html template of each of the
subclass. I Updated from beta 6 to beta 11 and didn't notice this in the
breaking changes. Perhaps it was never suppose to work in the first place? I
could change the code around to make it work again, which might actually turn
out better structured, but wanted to know if it suppose to work or just a bug.
What's happening now is that the variable is undefined in beta 11.
