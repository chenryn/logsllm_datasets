User: How to configure NTP synchronization time on the Linux system to maintain the time accuracy of the server?
Assistant: To configure NTP to synchronize time on a Linux system, follow these steps: 1. Install the ntp package You can install the ntp package using a package manager, such as yum or apt-get: - CentOS/RHEL systems: sudo yum install ntp - Ubuntu/Debian system: sudo apt-get install ntp 2. Configure NTP server Edit /etc/ntp.conf file, add NTP server address, for example: server ntp1.example.com server ntp2.example.com 3. Start NTP service On a Systemd system, you can use the systemctl command to start or restart the NTP service: sudo systemctl start ntpd sudo systemctl restart ntpd 4. Configure the NTP service to start automatically Use the following command along with the autostart NTP service to ensure that the service starts automatically when the system restarts , and run the default configuration: sudo systemctl enable ntpd 5. Verify NTP synchronization You can use the following command to verify whether NTP synchronization is successful: sudo ntpq -p The above are the steps to configure NTP synchronization time on the Linux system. NTP synchronization can ensure the time accuracy of the server, which is very important for some applications that require accurate time stamps.
