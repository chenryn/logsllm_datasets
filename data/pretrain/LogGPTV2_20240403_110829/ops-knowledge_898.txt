Question: "An adversary has gained administrator access to a network device and aims to compromise its encryption capabilities, thereby facilitating unauthorized disclosure and data manipulation. Which of the following actions is the adversary most likely to take to achieve this objective?"
 "A": "Increase the complexity of the encryption algorithm to burden the system resources excessively."
 "B": "Reduce the encryption key space to make the process of cryptanalysis less computationally intensive."
 "C": "Strengthen the encryption cipher to require a more advanced decryption key."
 "D": "Enable additional crypto hardware to increase the encryption workload on the device."
Answer: B
