User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why can I log in to my Facebook account with a misspelled email/password? I've been playing around with different login forms online lately to see how they work. One of them was the Facebook login form. When I logged out of my account my email and password were autocompleted by my browser. Then I decided to misspell my email and see what would happen if I tried to log in.

To my surprise I logged in with no problem after changing my email from example@gmail.com to example@gmail.comm. I then started experimenting with different spelling errors and I had no problem logging in as long as it was not too far off my real email. I tried changing the domain name as well example@gmadil.coom, my email prefix ezfxample@gmail.com etc. 

Then I also tried misspelling my password and as long as it was not too far off my real password I could log in no problem (with the password it worked when adding one random letter before or after the real password, but not when adding a letter in the middle of it).

I also checked the actual data sent in the request by looking at it in Chrome DevTools and in fact it was the wrong data sent.

How can this be? Should I be worried about my account's security?

Assistant: Facebook is allowing you to make a handful of mistakes to ease the login process. A Facebook engineer explained the process at a conference. The gist of it is that Facebook will try various permutations of the input you submitted and see if they match the hash they have in their database.

For example, if your password is "myRealPassword!" but you submit "MYrEALpASSWORD!" (capslock on, shift inverting capslock). The submitted password obviously doesn't match what they have stored in their database. Rather than reject you flat out, Facebook tries to up the user experience by trying to "correct" a few common mistakes such as inserting a random character before or after, capitalizing (or not) the first character, or mistakenly using capslock. Facebook applies these filters one by one and checks the newly "corrected" password against what they have hashed in their database. If one of the permutations matches, Facebook assumes you simply made a small mistake and authorizes your session. 

While worrying at first glance, this is actually still perfectly secure for a few reasons. First and foremost, Facebook is able to do this without storing the password in plaintext because they are transforming your provided (and untrusted) input from the form field and checking if it matches. Secondly, this isn't very helpful for someone trying to brute force the password because online attacks are nigh impossible thanks to rate limiting and captchas. Finally, the odds of an attacker/evil spouse knowing the text of your password and not the capitalization are abysmally small and so the risk created as a result of this feature is equally small.

Should you be worried? No, probably not.
