In this evaluation, we seek to answer the following questions. First,
how much effort is required to deploy new protocols across gulfs
using D-BGP? Second, what is the control-plane overhead of using D-
BGP to facilitate an evolvable Internet? Third, for different protocol
types, how much does D-BGP accelerate incremental benefits?
6.1 Deploying protocols
Effort required: To gain insight into this question, we implemented
basic versions of Pathlet Routing [21] (a replacement protocol) and
Wiser [32] (a critical fix) and then modified them to be deployed
across gulfs. We implemented and modified both protocols within
Beagle. Wiser simply extends Beagle’s existing BGP decision module.

Table 3: Control-plane overhead of D-BGP. This table shows estimated IA sizes and number of IAs that would be received at a tier-1 AS as a function of various
parameters. Equations or values identical to the previous corresponding entry are marked with a ”.
its remaining two one-hop pathlets into an IA and sends it across
the gulf. It also redistributes the two-hop pathlet into BGP so that
potential sources within gulf ASes can route traffic to the destination.
AS A3 translates the single one-hop pathlet it receives into an IA and
also redistributes it into BGP. Border routers at island B translate IAs
they receive into Pathlet Routing’s advertisement format. We verified
that AS S saw all five pathlets that should be advertised to it.
6.2 Control-plane overhead
Methodology: We evaluated control-plane overhead by estimating
properties of IAs that would be received at a tier-1 AS in an Internet
that is using D-BGP to run multiple inter-domain routing protocols.
Tier-1 ASes reside at the top of the Internet hierarchy, so they will see
the highest overheads. We analyzed three types of overhead: the size
of individual IAs that are received (indicative of per-IA CPU cost due
to serialization at a tier-1 AS), the number of IAs that are received
(also reflective of CPU cost), and aggregate size of all IAs received
(reflective of total overhead and the amount of state that must be
kept at the tier-1 AS). Our analysis does not account for the fact that
tier-1 ASes will see multiple IAs for the same prefix. Incorporating
this would inflate our calculated overheads by a constant amount.
To derive estimated IAs sizes and their number, we used charac-
terizations of the Internet topology and protocols’ expected control-
information sizes culled from recent research and RFCs [5, 7, 44].
Table 2 lists key parameters, the ranges of values we consider, and our
reasoning behind our choices for these ranges. Whenever possible,
we chose ranges based on estimates in the literature. For parameters
whose values are more uncertain (e.g., number of critical fixes), we
consider a broad range of possible values to allow for future protocols’
as-yet undetermined needs. We do not consider proxy aggregation
because of its limited use today [9].
Results: Table 3 shows our results. IA sizes are further broken
down into contribution by protocol type (critical fix or custom /
replacement). For each overhead type estimated, we list a range of
minimum and maximum values, derived from the equations, param-
eters, and values discussed in Table 2.
We find that a basic analysis that assumes individual IAs received
at a tier-1 will contain information for all protocols yields very large
aggregate overheads. + Avg. path lengths improves this analysis by

accounting for the fact that IA size is a function of the number of
protocols on a routing path, not the total number. This reduces our
estimate of maximum aggregate overhead by an order of magnitude.
+ Sharing improves our analysis by accounting for the fact that many
critical fixes can share the majority of their control information. This
yields significant savings and reduces both our minimum and maxi-
mum estimates by an additional order of magnitude.
We also compare D-BGP’s overheads with multiple protocols to
the case where only a single protocol is running, which should be
similar to the overheads seen today with BGP (4KB control infor-
mation) or a large critical fix (256KB control information). Despite
our generous assumption of 3-5 critical fixes and 3-5 custom or re-
placement protocols on routing paths, we find that D-BGP only adds
a factor of 1.3x overhead for our minimum estimates and 2.5x for
our maximum estimates. This is largely a result of the savings due to
sharing of critical fixes’ control information.
Incremental benefits
6.3
Methodology: We evaluated D-BGP’s ability to provide incremental
benefits for protocol archetypes that have different aims. To measure
the benefits D-BGP can natively provide, we do not assume tunnels
will be used. We do not consider benefits for protocols that require
an unbroken chain of participation (e.g., secure protocols) as D-BGP
cannot accelerate incremental benefits for them.
To measure incremental benefits, we simulated various archetypes’
path choices on an AS-level topology in which an increasing frac-
tion of ASes have adopted (i.e., deployed) the archetype and the rest
use BGP to select paths (i.e., are in gulfs). We plotted the benefits
afforded to upgraded ASes at each adoption level (the slope of which
corresponds to incremental benefits). We compare two basic cases:
an Internet in which BGP is the baseline and an Internet in which
D-BGP is the baseline. In the former case, new protocols’ control
information must be dropped before sending advertisements across
gulfs. In the latter case, it can be passed through.
Our topology, which is annotated with customer/provider relation-
ships, but not peering ones, is generated by BRITE [34], configured
to generate 1,000 ASes using a Waxman model (with α= 0.15 and
β= 0.25) [14,16,25]. We simulated various archetypes’ decisions and
that of BGP using a version of the simulator used by Jon et al. and
Peter et al. [27,36]. Protocols’ path choices are always valley-free [38].
ASes that have not been upgraded choose paths with the shortest
path length [10]. This is BGP’s second path-selection criteria, ranked
only below ASes’ local preferences, which are opaque to us.
We consider two archetypes. The extra-paths archetype corresponds
to protocols, such as SCION [63], NIRA [61], and Pathlet Routing [21],
that only aim to expose extra information within islands. Given a set
of inter-island paths to a destination, this archetype chooses the one
containing the greatest number of total paths to it. Our implementa-
tion only allows each inter-island path to carry a maximum of ten
paths to a destination.
The bottleneck-bandwidth archetype corresponds to protocols, such
as EQ-BGP [6], that aim to optimize a global objective function.
Given a set of paths to a destination, this archetype chooses the one
with the greatest minimum per-AS bandwidth (only upgraded ASes
expose their bandwidth). We chose this archetype because it is one of
the most difficult objective functions with which to see incremental
benefits. Its benefits depend on a single AS’s bandwidth, which may
be in a gulf until deployment rates are high. In contrast, some other
protocols that aim to optimize a global objective, such as end-to-end
latency, would see higher rates of incremental benefits.
For our experiments, upgraded ASes are chosen randomly, reflect-
ing the ideal case of providing ASes the flexibility to deploy a new
protocol independently of their neighbors. Our results reflect the
average of nine trials, each with different random seeds. Benefits
are plotted at adoption increments of 10% and error bars indicate
95% confidence intervals. For the bandwidth experiment, ASes’ band-
widths are values on their traffic ingress links. They are uniformly
distributed between a range of 10 and 1024 (the range does not affect
our results much).
Results: Figure 9 shows the benefits offered to upgraded ASes
by the extra-paths archetype as a function of the adoption level. We
measure benefit as the number extra paths available to destinations at
upgraded stubs. At 10% adoption, there is no difference between BGP
and D-BGP baseline because there are not enough ASes that have
adopted the protocol (this is a limitation of our AS-level topology,
which does not expose intra-AS paths). Benefits at 20% adoption are
greater than with the BGP baseline in many runs of our experiment.
In cases where they are equal, there are not enough contiguous ASes
to form extra paths.
We additionally see that incremental benefit (the slope of the lines)
with the D-BGP baseline is greater than the BGP baseline at low
adoption rates (i.e., between when 10 and 40% of ASes have upgraded).
Incremental benefit for the BGP baseline exceeds D-BGP at higher
adoption rates because, at this point, large upgraded islands start to
connect and see massive benefits as a result of doing so. However,
total benefits with the D-BGP baseline is always greater (or equal to)
than the BGP baseline at all adoption levels.
Figure 10 shows the benefits afforded to upgraded ASes by the
bottleneck-bandwidth archetype. We measure benefit as the average
bottleneck bandwidth associated with the best paths chosen at each
upgraded AS. The status quo line represents the average bottleneck
bandwidth associated with ASes’ best path choices at 0% adoption.
With both the D-BGP baseline and the BGP baseline, benefits ini-
tially decline at low adoption rates compared to 0% adoption. This is
because upgraded ASes are making ill-informed path choices with
Figure 9: Incremental benefits for extra-paths archetype.
