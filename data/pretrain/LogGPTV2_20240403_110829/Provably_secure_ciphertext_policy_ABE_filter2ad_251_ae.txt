# Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE)

## 4. Example of Threshold Access Tree

Consider the following threshold access tree (Figure 4):

```
2-of-3
 / | \
1  2  3
```

To recover \( e(g, g)^{r \cdot s_1} = Q_5 \), we need to select a random degree-1 polynomial \( p \) such that \( p(0) = s \). For \( i = 1, 2, 3 \), we set \( s_i := p(i) \). The root is a 2-of-3 threshold gate, meaning any two of the values \( s_1, s_2, \) and \( s_3 \) are sufficient to recover \( s \).

At the leaf level, each AND gate is treated as in the basic scheme of Section 3. For instance, the leftmost AND gate includes the following group elements in the ciphertext:
\[ h^{g^{s_1}}, T^{s_1}_{2 \cdot 5 + 5} \]
This allows any user with attributes 1, 2, and 3 to recover:
\[ \prod_{i=1}^3 e(g, g)^{r_i \cdot s_1} \]

The other AND gates are represented similarly in the ciphertext using the tuples:
\[ h^{g^{s_2}}, T^{s_2}_{3}, T^{s_2}_{2 \cdot 5 + 1}, T^{s_2}_{5} \]
and
\[ h^{g^{s_3}}, T^{s_3}_{4}, T^{s_3}_{2 \cdot 5 + 1}, T^{s_3}_{5} \]

Thus, any user satisfying at least two of the three AND gates can decrypt by recovering \( e(g, g)^{r \cdot s} \).

### Insecurity of the Extended Scheme

Unfortunately, this extended scheme is insecure. The key issue is that \( s_1, s_2, \) and \( s_3 \) are not independent random values. Consider a user with attributes \(\neg 1, 2, 3, 4, \neg 5\). Only the middle AND gate is satisfied by this attribute set, and decryption should not be allowed. However, since 5 is a "don't care" in the first two AND gates, the user can recover \( e(g, g)^{r_5 \cdot s_1} \) and \( e(g, g)^{r_5 \cdot s_2} \). Since \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \) are distinct points on the same degree-1 polynomial, \( e(g, g)^{r_5 \cdot s_3} \) can be recovered using interpolation. Additionally, the user has attributes 3 and 4, and attributes 1 and 2 are "don't cares" in the last AND gate, allowing them to obtain \( e(g, g)^{r_i \cdot s_3} \) for \( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Combining these with \( e(g, g)^{r_5 \cdot s_3} \) from interpolation, the user can now recover \( e(g, g)^{r \cdot s_3} \), violating the access policy.

### Avoiding Attacks

To avoid such attacks, it seems necessary to have independent random exponents \( s_1, s_2, \) and \( s_3 \), so the attacker cannot take advantage of "don't cares" and polynomial interpolation. One approach is to perform secret sharing on the message \( M \) to obtain shares \( M_1, M_2, \) and \( M_3 \), which are then encrypted independently to the three AND gates. However, this proposal suffers from collusion attacks: if one user can recover \( M_1 \) and another can recover \( M_2 \), they can collude to recover \( M \).

Collusion attacks of this type pose no threat when restricted to disjunctive normal form (DNF) policies, although a formal security proof remains elusive. The difficulty lies in the selective ID security game, where the adversary must commit to a challenge access structure before the game starts. If multiple AND gates are used, the simulator in the reduction proof must choose one of the AND gates and use it to obtain the public key. It is unclear how the simulator can predict which AND gate is "good" before the game starts.

A possible solution is to consider adaptive ID security, which strengthens selective ID security by allowing the adversary to choose a challenge access structure in the Challenge phase. In this setting, we can prove the security of multiple encryptions [7]. Thus, finding adaptive ID security proofs for CP-ABE remains an important future work.

## 7. Applications

### 7.1 Selective Data Sharing

Consider a scenario where a large corporation installs a standing committee to investigate reports of improper conduct by employees. Members of this committee are drawn from different departments and locations, and are given three different clearance levels. Using a hierarchical CP-ABE instance similar to that in Section 5, these attributes can be categorized as in Figure 5.

**Figure 5: Attributes By Category**

```
Committee
   |
   +--- Dept
   |     |
   |     +--- HR
   |     +--- Acc
   |     +--- Pur
   |
   +--- Loc
   |     |
   |     +--- NY
   |     +--- DC
   |     +--- LA
   |
   +--- Clr
        |
        +--- 1
        +--- 2
        +--- 3
```

Suppose there is an investigation regarding an accounting officer in New York, and company policy states that no committee member from the accounting department in New York may participate. To encrypt a memo, the content is first encrypted with a symmetric data key. The data key is then encrypted separately with the AND gates in Figures 6 and 7. The two ciphertexts are placed in a header accompanying the encrypted memo. Anyone not belonging to the accounting department can decrypt the first ciphertext, and anyone not working in New York can decrypt the second. This enforces the desired access policy.

### 7.2 Group Key Management

CP-ABE is well-suited for the problem of Group Key Management (GKM) in secure multicast. This requires a Group Controller (GC) to maintain a shared data encryption key, known only to current group members (GMs). New GMs receive this data key through a secure unicast channel upon joining. The main challenge is membership revocation: excluding a subset of GMs from future communications. This action requires distributing a new data key to all remaining GMs, ensuring revoked members no longer have access to future messages.

CP-ABE can solve the GKM problem by defining attributes such that any subset of users can be distinguished from the rest. Each GM is associated with a set of attributes, and for revocation, the GC computes an access policy that is (i) satisfied by the attribute sets of all remaining users and (ii) not satisfied by the attribute set of any revoked user. Remaining GMs can use their secret keys to recover the new data key, while revoked GMs gain no information even if they collude.

In [6], we constructed a collusion-resistant variant of the flat table GKM scheme using the CP-ABE scheme of [1] and associating \( \log(N) \) attributes with each GM, where \( N \) is the size of the ID space. Each attribute corresponds to one bit in the GM's ID, and the GM receives a CP-ABE secret key associated with their ID. For revocation, the GC runs a Boolean function minimization algorithm to obtain a sum of products expression that separates revoked users from the remaining membership. This expression is viewed as a threshold access tree, and CP-ABE is used to distribute the new data key.

## 8. Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we present several related CP-ABE schemes. The basic scheme allows an encryptor to use any AND gate on positive and negative attributes as an access policy on the ciphertext. This scheme is proven to be CPA secure under the DBDH assumption. To achieve CCA security, we extend the basic scheme with strongly existentially unforgeable one-time signatures.

We also present a variant with substantially smaller ciphertexts and faster encryption/decryption operations. The main idea is to form a hierarchy of attributes, reducing the number of group elements needed to represent all attributes in the system. This efficient variant is proven to be CPA secure. We believe our CCA secure scheme can be optimized similarly.

For disjunctive normal form policies, we propose the use of independent instances of CP-ABE encryption. The security of this proposal remains an open problem, as we seek adaptive ID security proofs for CP-ABE.
