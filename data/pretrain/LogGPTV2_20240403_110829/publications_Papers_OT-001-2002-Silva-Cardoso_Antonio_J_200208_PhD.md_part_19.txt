CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS
Organizations operating in global and competitive markets require a high level of quality
of service (QoS) management. The use of workflow systems to automate, support,
coordinate, and manage business processes enables organizations to reduce costs and
increase efficiency. However, workflow systems should be viewed as more than just
driving forces of automation or mechanization. They should be used to reshape and re-
engineer the way business is done. One way to achieve a continuous process of
improvement is to view and analyze workflow processes from a QoS perspective. This
allows processes to be designed and adapted according to quality of service constraints
drawn from organizational goals and strategies.
New trading models, such as e-commerce, bring a new set of challenges and
requirements that need to be explored and answered. In such processes, trading
agreements between suppliers and customers include the specification of QoS items such
as products or services to be delivered, deadlines, quality of products, and cost of service.
The correct management of such QoS requirements directly impacts the success of the
organizations participating in e-commerce and also directly impacts the success and
evolution of e-commerce itself. The composition of Web services, and therefore of
workflows, cannot be undertaken while ignoring the importance of quality of service
measurements. A good management of QoS leads to the creation of quality products and
services; this in turn, fulfills customer expectations and achieves customer satisfaction.
The good management of QoS becomes increasingly important when workflow systems
200
are used in new organizational and trading models, such as in vritual organizations and e-
commerce activities that span organizational boundaries .
While QoS management is of a high importance to organizations, current WfMSs
and workflow applications do not provide adequate features to support QoS. Three
research areas need to be explored. First, a good theoretical QoS model is necessary to
formally specify and represent QoS metrics for workflow tasks. Second, algorithms and
mechanisms are necessary to synthesize workflow QoS based on the QoS metrics of the
tasks that compose the workflow. Third, experimental workflow systems need to be
developed to identify the challenges and difficulties associated with the implementation
of QoS management.
Chapter 2 discusses and explains the importance of quality of service managemetn
for workflow and workflow systems. Based on our experience in developing of workflow
applications for various domains and with emergent workflow requirements, we present a
QoS model. This model allows for the description of workflow components (tasks) from
a quality of service perspective; it includes four dimensions: time, cost, reliability, and
fidelity. The use of QoS increases the added value of workflow systems to organizations,
since the non functional aspects of workflows can be described.
Once the QoS of workflow components is specified, the QoS of workflows can be
automatically computed. This feature is important, especially for large processes, which
in some cases may include hundreds of tasks. For this reason, we present a mathematical
model and describe how a simulation system can be used with a workflow system to
carry out efficient workflow QoS simulations. Both approaches enable a predictive
computation of workflows QoS based on QoS estimates for tasks. The mathematical
model formally describes a set of formulae for computing QoS metrics among workflow
tasks. Based on these formulae, we have developed an algorithm (SWR algorithm) to
automatically compute the overall QoS of workflows. The algorithm applies a set of
201
reduction rules to a workflow, until only one task remains which represents the QoS for
the entire workflow.
To test the validity of our QoS model and of our mathematical model we have
deployed a set of production workflows in the area of genetics (Fungal Genome Resource
Laboratory). We have executed several workflow instances, and the generated QoS data
have been collected and analyzed. Analysis of the data has corroborated our initial
hypothesis, which states that our QoS model and mathematical model provide a suitable
framework for predicting and analyzing the QoS of production workflows.
Having developed a QoS theoretical model and an algorithm to compute workflow
QoS, the next step was the implementation of these new concepts in a workflow system.
For this purpose, we have selected the METEOR system developed at the LSDIS Lab.
Chapter 3 describes in detail the modifications and extensions necessary for workflow
systems components to support QoS management. Modifications are necessary for some
components, including the enactment system, the workflow builder (or designer), the
monitor, the code generator, the repository, the workflow model, and the task model.
Additionally, new components need to be implemented, such as a QoS estimator module
to create QoS estimates for tasks and probabilities for transitions. The monitor needs an
additional interface so that runtime tasks QoS metrics are propagated and logged into a
database for data processing purposes.
Chapter 4 discusses and the set of challenges that the emergence of Web services and
e-services has brought to organizations. While in some cases Web services may be
utilized in an isolated form, it is normal to expect Web services to be integrated as part of
workflows processes. This entails research in two areas. Mechanisms to effciiently
