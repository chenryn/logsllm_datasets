are pros and cons for everything, and there are times and places for
tools. WSL has its benefits as well as drawbacks. A lot of great tools
have been developed for Linux that are free, and WSL supports a wide
variety of Linux distributions. WSL is easy to install, and it takes
about 5 minutes (not counting the reboot). While WSL is running, you can
access your local machines filesystem from the subsystem. The flip side
of this is that WSL is almost like a Linux lite. It was not engineered
for heavy‐duty production loads, and it might be more efficient and
faster to run a full‐fledged virtual machine. WSL is command line only.
There is no GUI, so that can be a drawback for some. As a friend of
mine, Josh Franz, a security consultant at Rapid7, told me, "It can just
be buggy." He\'s right. The earlier iterations had limitations with what
networking commands worked. Like any security tool we use, WSL will
continue to evolve.
The Social Engineer Toolkit was written by David Kennedy and with a lot
of help from the security community has evolved into a tool specifically
used against people and their weaknesses. The attacks that are built
into this toolkit are reminiscent of Metasploit; however, instead of
focusing on network or application attacks, it assists penetration
testers to target a person or organization.
Before you can install the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET), you have to
turn on WSL in Windows 10 and reboot the machine. Go to your Control
Panel, open []{#c13.xhtml#Page_197 .pagebreak title="197"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Programs And Features, and find the option to Turn
Windows Features On Or Off. Scroll down toward the bottom until you find
Windows Subsystem For Linux; then check that box and click OK, as you
see in [Figure
13.3](#c13.xhtml#c13-fig-0003){#c13.xhtml#R_c13-fig-0003}. The system
should prompt you to reboot the computer so this feature can be
available.

Once your machine has rebooted, go to your Start menu, and it is time to
go shopping at the Microsoft Store. Open the Microsoft Store and look
for the magnifying glass in the upper right. In the Search field in the
upper right, look for Ubuntu. There are several flavors for you to
choose from. Open Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. As you see in [Figure
13.4](#c13.xhtml#c13-fig-0004){#c13.xhtml#R_c13-fig-0004}, this version
of Ubuntu 18.04 on Windows will let you run an Ubuntu Terminal and run
the Ubuntu command‐line utilities, including bash, ssh, apt, and many
more.[]{#c13.xhtml#Page_198 .pagebreak title="198" role="doc-pagebreak"}

If you click the More hyperlink above the word *Free*, you\'re reminded
that this tool is used through a command prompt so you need to turn that
feature on. As you see in [Figure

We all have our heroes. Linus Torvalds is one of mine. His philosophy is
"Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work
done." At 10 years old, he was not happy with the MS‐DOS and decided to
create his own operating system based on UNIX. In 1991, he posted a
message that he was ready to share what would become Linux. The original
code and Linux kernel version 1.0 was released in 1994, and it has been
the operating system of choice of geeks everywhere. In addition to being
free, it rarely crashed and can be modified by anyone. Not only is
Torvalds father of Linux, he also created Git.
[]{#c13.xhtml#Page_200 .pagebreak title="200" role="doc-pagebreak"}Git
is what we call a distributed version‐control system. What this means to
developers is that if you clone a Git project, you have the entire
project history. You can develop all you want on your local machine with
no need of server interaction. GitHub also stores a copy of your
project. You designate the project\'s central library or repository, and
developers can push and pull all they want. Git is the system; GitHub is
the service. I explained it because you\'re about to install it.
In [Lab 13.2](#c13.xhtml#c13-fea-0002){#c13.xhtml#R_c13-fea-0002},

Most of what I teach is done virtually with customers over
teleconferencing. The most difficult thing to do with virtual training
is to engage the student. They don\'t see me, and I don\'t see them. I
do not have the ability to read body language. I cannot see the crinkle
between their eyes when they\'re confused. I also can\'t see when they
have gotten up to get more coffee or are sidetracked by emails and phone
calls, so student engagement is key. One of our conversations in the
Nexpose Vulnerability Management class centers around the cybersecurity
philosophy of viewing you and your ecosystem as an attacker would. I ask
the question, "What do new pen testers or hackers download as their
operating system of choice?" I\'m surprised by how many blue‐teamers
have never heard of Kali Linux. I\'ve been playing Kali since before it
was Kali and was called Backtrack.
Kali Linux debuted in 2013 as a total rewrite of the free Linux
distribution called BackTrack. BackTrack was based on the Knoppix Linux
OS, whereas now Kali Linux is based on the Debian Linux OS and is funded
and maintained by Offensive Security. Kali Linux still remains free and
contains more than 600 penetration tools with a wide range of wireless
device support. BackTrack was started as an answer to Mati Aharoni\'s
need for a tool to take on an engagement where he could not bring any
hardware except a laptop, which would be taken from him at the end of
the engagement. Mati is the founder and core developer of the Kali Linux
and is the CTO at Offensive Security. Interestingly
