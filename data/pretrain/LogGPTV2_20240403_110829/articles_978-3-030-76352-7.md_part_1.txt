Preface
Thisvolumepresentstheproceedingsofthescientificsatelliteeventsthatwereheldin
conjunction with the 18th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing
(ICSOC 2020), held virtually during December 14–17, 2020. The satellite events
provideanengagingspaceforspecialistgroupstomeet,generatingfocuseddiscussions
on specific sub-areas within service-oriented computing, which contributes to ICSOC
community-building. These events significantly helped enrich the main conference by
both expanding the scope of research topics and attracting participants from a wider
community.
As is customary for ICSOC, this year, these satellite events were organized around
three main tracks, comprising a workshop track, a PhD symposium track, and a
demonstration track.
The ICSOC 2020 workshop track consisted of the following five workshops cov-
ering a wide range of topics that fall into the general area of service computing.
 International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps 2020)
 InternationalWorkshoponCyberForensicsandThreatInvestigationsChallengesin
Emerging Infrastructures (CFTIC 2020)
 2nd Workshop on Smart Data Integration and Processing (STRAPS 2020)
 International Workshop on AI-enabled Process Automation (AI-PA 2020)
 International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in the IoT Security Services
(AI-IOTS 2020)
This year in the workshop track, the theme of artificial intelligence and its appli-
cations in service computing was particularly noticeable. All papers accepted to the
workshops were peer reviewed and overall acceptance rates for the workshops were
lessthan50%.TheworkshopswereheldonDecember14,2020,andincludedkeynote
talks from prominent speakers from industry and academia.
The PhD symposium is an international forum for PhD students to present, share,
and discuss their research in a constructive and critical atmosphere. It also provides
students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach and thesis. The
PhD symposium track was held over a half-day session and included nine accepted
papers. This year, and due to COVID-19, the conference supported all PhD students
and their participation was fully free of charge.
The demonstration track offers an exciting and highly interactive way to show
research prototypes/work in service-oriented computing and related areas. The
demonstration track was held over a two-hour session for the presentations and then
dedicated sessions for real-time demonstrations, running in parallel. Four demonstra-
tions were accepted and presented during the conference.
We would like to thank the workshops, PhD symposium, and demonstration track
authors, as well as the Organizing Committees, who together contributed to these
important events of the conference. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a
vi Preface
valuable reference for researchers and practitioners working in the service-oriented
computing domain and its emerging applications.
