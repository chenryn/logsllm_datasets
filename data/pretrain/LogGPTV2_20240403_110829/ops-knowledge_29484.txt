User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple attempts to initialize the mod_jk child workerEnv, each time resulting in an error state 6. The attempts are made at 12:55:49, 13:00:33, 13:00:34, 13:05:24, 13:10:55, 13:16:27, and 13:16:29. Each attempt is preceded by the jk2_init() finding a child in a scoreboard slot.
