Today, I encountered an issue where Atom is unable to properly display Unicode characters in most fonts. I have tested a variety of font families, including Droid, Consolata, Inconsolata, Monospace, Courier, Sans-Serif, Arial, Impact, Ubuntu, and Ubuntu Mono, but only the "Sans" font seems to work correctly.

Here are some examples:

- **In "Sans" font:**

- **In "Monospace" font:**
  ![Monospace](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4805640/7128041/2bfc89e4-e223-11e4-878f-9c19b718c347.png)

I do not experience any issues with displaying Unicode characters in other applications; the problem appears to be specific to Atom.

For reference, here is the version information for my system and Atom:

```plaintext
lucas ~> apm -v
apm 0.157.0
npm 2.5.1
node 0.10.35
python 2.7.6
git 1.9.1

```

This information might be helpful in diagnosing the issue.
