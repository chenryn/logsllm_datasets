### Comparison of Latency Between EXITBRIDGE and Tor

The comparison between EXITBRIDGE and Tor shows that the additional latency introduced by the extra hop to the exit bridge is insignificant and would not noticeably affect users' browsing experience. This is unsurprising, as Tor is known to incur a significant latency penalty [13, 49], which overshadows the cost of including an additional hop for the exit bridge.

To further analyze the latency, we break down the time spent in each step of the communication. Our study confirms that Tor is the primary contributor to the end-to-end latency. Additionally, we observe that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Tor plateaus at approximately 92%. This is mainly due to some Tor-blocking websites not returning responses or returning error codes.

### Time-to-First-Byte Latency Analysis

The cumulative distribution of the time-to-first-byte latencies is shown in Figure 7b. The figure indicates a similar trend to the time-to-last-byte measurements (presented in §V-C): the performance of EXITBRIDGE is comparable to that of Tor.

To confirm our hypothesis that Tor is the main factor contributing to the end-to-end latency, we further break down the time-to-first-byte latency. This is achieved by analyzing the pcap files collected at the local relay and the exit bridge (we capture only our own traffic). We consider the following four contributing factors:

- **TLOCALPROXY**: The time required to relay traffic through the local relay.
- **TONTHEFLY**: The time required for traffic to traverse either via Tor (in both the TOR and EXITBRIDGE configurations) or direct IP communication (in the case of PROXYONLY). For Tor, TONTHEFLY also includes the latency of direct HTTP/S requests and responses.
- **TEXITBRIDGE**: The time required to relay traffic through an exit bridge.
- **TDIRECTHTTP/S**: The latency of direct HTTP/S requests and responses.

Figure 7c shows the breakdown of the time-to-first-byte latency. We observe that the latency is dominated by the traversal through the Tor network (TONTHEFLY). The performance overheads added by the exit bridge (i.e., TLOCALPROXY and TEXITBRIDGE) are insignificant in comparison.

### Summary of Exit Bridge Performance

In summary, exit bridges enable Tor users to access most Tor-blocking sites with similar overall performance as Tor.

### Assessing Collateral Damage

A website operator may block traffic from exit bridges by blocking access from the cloud service providers that host these bridges. We consider the collateral costs of such blocking. The degree of collateral damage depends on the frequency at which non-Tor traffic to the website originates from these cloud service providers. Our findings suggest that websites already see a surprisingly large fraction of requests originating from the cloud, leading to significant collateral damage if they are blocked.

#### Cloud Services and Collateral Damage

Amazon provides a managed, cloud desktop service called Amazon Workspaces [2]. We studied one instance of Amazon Workspaces by setting up our own cloud desktop and found its IP to be within the IP range of AWS [3]. This implies that blocking AWS will also harm the users of AWS-based virtual desktops. Similar services are offered by Google Cloud [6] and Microsoft Azure [7].

We examined a three-day snapshot of our institution's web logs to determine if any requests originated from IPs belonging to AWS [3], Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure [29]. We excluded all requests for robots.txt or those containing the (case-insensitive) substrings bot, crawler, spider, indexer, or b-o-t in the USER-AGENT header. Among the 5.7 million total requests, we surprisingly found that 5.6% of client requests originated from IPs within AWS, with smaller amounts from Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. More than two-thirds of these requests came from users using Chrome, Internet Explorer/Edge, Firefox, or Opera, suggesting that most of these cloud-based requests resulted from actual browsing activity. We posit that losing more than 5% of potential site requests to prevent Tor users from accessing the site is too high a cost for the website operator. Additionally, with the increasing trend of companies migrating their IT needs to cloud-based solutions, it will likely become even more costly to blindly block all accesses from the cloud.

### Anonymity and Security Considerations

We discuss the privacy and security implications of our exit bridge infrastructure, organized by the participating parties.

#### Exit Relays

Exit bridges receive traffic from Tor circuits that terminate at exit relays (see Figure 3). Our design adds another hop to the anonymous path, reducing the role of an exit relay from an egress point to effectively a second middle relay. The TLS Relays that reside on the client and the exit bridge encrypt all traffic between them, preventing the exit relay from learning the client’s requested destination.

The exit relay could perform traffic analysis (e.g., throughput [30] or website fingerprinting [9, 38, 52]), just as any other middle relay. We consider such attacks orthogonal since they equally apply to Tor’s current design.

#### Exit Bridges

As with traditional exits, an exit bridge learns the client’s destination but not the identity of the client. The risks of using exit bridges are similar to but distinct from those of using meek bridges. A meek bridge allows the cloud provider to observe ingress traffic and enumerate the users (or their IPs) of the meek bridge. This is arguably a greater anonymity threat than, in the case of exit bridges, the cloud provider learning the requested destinations. Although we use AWS in our deployment, multiple independently operated cloud providers can be used to host distinct exit bridge networks, offering some decentralization. However, such providers are limited, and funneling traffic through the cloud is a fundamental feature (and anonymity risk) of our design.

To maintain Tor’s unlinkability, an exit bridge is dedicated for a single user visiting a single website (see §IV-B). Thus, a malicious exit bridge cannot link multiple sites visited by a user. Similarly, colluding exit bridges cannot reliably link traffic as belonging to the same user since each connection to a bridge uses an independent Tor circuit.

Finally, to prevent trivial traffic correlation attacks [25, 33, 37], the Tor Browser should ensure that the ingress point (e.g., a guard or bridge) is not hosted by the same provider as the exit bridge. (Popular cloud providers publish their IP address ranges.) We are planning to add such checks to our implementation.

#### Broker

The broker operates as a hidden service, and all connections to the broker occur over independent Tor circuits. This prevents even a malicious broker from learning the network locations of the clients or linking two requests as belonging to the same client. The broker assigns clients to exit bridges—forcing users to use a malicious exit bridge is equivalent to users selecting a malicious exit; this case is covered above.

To prevent tracking by the broker using client-side cookies, the Tor Browser extension should prevent or delete cookies from the broker site (this feature is currently under development). We additionally rely on the extensive anti-fingerprinting techniques provided by the Tor Browser [39] to prevent other methods of breaking unlinkability.

### Ethics

We consider the ethical considerations of this paper from two dimensions: the ethics of our experiments and the ethics of a future Tor deployment of exit bridges.

#### Ethics of Experimentation

We believe the experiments described in §V are well within the bounds of ethical and responsible research. As a guiding ethical framework, we consider the Menlo Report [14], an extension of the Belmont Report [34] for ethical research specifically tailored for computer security research. The Menlo Report describes four main principles of ethical studies: respect for persons, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest.

Since our experiments do not concern human users or data derived from human users (and thus are not covered by our institutional review board), they trivially achieve the first and third criteria. To the best of our knowledge, our experiments pose no significant risks and do not violate any laws (at least not in our jurisdiction); in general, we simply retrieved publicly accessible webpages via AWS. Notably, the effects of our experiments (visiting webpages) are identical to what would have occurred had we retrieved the webpages using virtual AWS Workspaces. In summary, we believe that our experiments meet the ethical criteria of the Menlo Report and fall well within the norms of computer science research.

#### Ethics of an Exit Bridge Deployment

We separately consider the ethics of a publicly accessible exit bridge deployment. As with many privacy-preserving and censorship-evading technologies, the ethics of such a system are multifaceted and complex. In the remainder of this section, we attempt to highlight some of the major ethical issues involved in allowing users to bypass site-based blocking of Tor.

**Are we circumventing security?** There are many reasons sites might block access from Tor, including fear of malicious traffic relayed through the anonymity network. By design, exit bridges conceal that the traffic traversed through Tor, and thus could permit malicious traffic to reach a destination which it otherwise could not have. However, there are myriad other ways in which attackers already can disguise the origins of attack traffic, including the use of open proxies, VPNs, and botnets. We are skeptical that preventing access from Tor provides websites with much security, but it is important to acknowledge that exit bridges do bypass such protections.

We note that the CAPTCHA puzzle-solving requirement provides some mitigation against automated activities (for example, spamming and crawling) that often irk site operators. The (human) work required to connect via an exit relay—while not especially burdensome to an individual user—makes it more difficult (albeit not impossible) for an attacker to use the exit bridge infrastructure to do automated activities.

**If sites purposefully block access to Tor for philosophical reasons, is it appropriate to permit such access?** This is the reciprocal to “if a country disallows access to Tor, is it ethical to provide access (e.g., through bridges) anyway?” Both traditional bridges and exit bridges purposefully violate policies, just at opposite ends of the communication. There is also some similarity to the case of ad and web tracker blockers, which can violate sites’ acceptable use policies but which protect users’ privacy.

The pertinent section of the Menlo Report [14, see §C.5] acknowledges that public interest (here, allowing users to freely and privately access public websites) may conflict with acceptable use and other policies. The Report requires in such cases that there be “ethically defensible justification” [14, see §C.5.1], which is admittedly a very subjective criterion. In brief, we believe that allowing users to browse privately is of such immense public interest that it justifies the use of exit bridges.

**Are we imposing a burden on the cloud service provider if Tor users use exit bridges to perform illegal actions?** Tor is used by criminals to access illegal content (e.g., child abuse imagery) and perform other illegal actions [36]. As happens with exit relays, the illegal activity could be misattributed to the exit bridge—and thus the cloud service provider—since traffic appears to be originating from the provider. From the (U.S.-centric) legal perspective, the cloud service provider has little legal liability. In particular, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides indemnification (i.e., so-called “safe harbor” protections) for entities that act solely as a “conduit” for forwarding traffic [50]. The Tor Project does not know of any individuals being sued or prosecuted for running exit relays [19], and the same would likely apply to exit bridges.

A potential mitigation that reduces the burden and exposure of the cloud service provider is to use a whitelisting strategy in which exit bridges are configured to only create connections to sites that block Tor. This would likely still permit access to blocked sites while substantially reducing or even eliminating abuse complaints. And, as mentioned above, the use of CAPTCHAs may stymie automated activities (e.g., crawling), potentially reducing the number of complaints sent to the cloud service provider.
