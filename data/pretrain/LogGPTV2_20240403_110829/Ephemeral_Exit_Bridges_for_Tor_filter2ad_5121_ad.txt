ison between EXITBRIDGE and TOR shows that the latency
introduced by the extra hop to the exit bridge was insignif-
icant and would not likely noticeably affect users’ browsing
experience. (This is mostly unsurprising since Tor is known to
incur a large latency penalty [13, 49], which overwhelms the
cost of including an additional hop for the exit bridge.) We
further break down the latency to reveal the time spent in each
step of the communication and our study conﬁrms that Tor is
the main contributing factor to the end-to-end latency. We also
observe that the CDF of TOR plateaus at approximately 92%.
This is mainly because some Tor-blocking websites did not
return responses or returned error codes.
The cumulative distribution of the time-to-ﬁrst-byte laten-
cies is shown in Figure 7b. The Figure shows a similar trend
as the time-to-last-byte measurements (presented in §V-C): the
performance of EXITBRIDGE is close to that of TOR.
To conﬁrm our conjecture that Tor is the main contributing
factor to the end-to-end latency, we further break down the
time-to-ﬁrst-byte latency to reveal the time spent in each step
of the communication. This is achieved by analyzing the pcap
ﬁles collected at the local relay and the exit bridge (again, we
capture only our own trafﬁc). We consider the following four
contributing factors:
• TLOCALPROXY: the time required to relay trafﬁc through the
local relay;
• TONTHEFLY: the time required for trafﬁc to traverse either
via Tor (in either the TOR or EXITBRIDGE conﬁguration)
or direct IP communication (in the case of PROXYONLY).
In the case of TOR, TONTHEFLY also includes the latency
of direct HTTP/S requests/responses;
• TEXITBRIDGE: the time required to relay trafﬁc through an
exit bridge; and
• TDIRECTHTTP/S:
requests/responses.

Figure 7c shows the breakdown of the time-to-ﬁrst-byte la-
tency. We observe that the latency is dominated by the traver-
sal through the Tor network (TONTHEFLY). The performance
overheads added by the exit bridge (i.e., TLOCALPROXY and
TEXITBRIDGE) are insigniﬁcant in comparison.
In summary, exit bridges enable Tor users to access most
Tor-blocking sites, with similar overall performance as Tor.
D. Assessing Collateral Damage
A website operator may block trafﬁc from exit bridges by
blocking access from the cloud service providers that host
the bridges. We consider the collateral costs of such blocking.
The degree of collateral damage is dependent on the regularity
at which non-Tor trafﬁc to the website originates from these
cloud service providers. Our ﬁndings suggest that websites
may already see a surprisingly large fraction of requests
that originate from the cloud, leading to signiﬁcant collateral
damage if they are blocked.
Amazon provides a managed, cloud desktop service called
Amazon Workspaces [2]. We studied one instance of Amazon
Workspaces by setting up our own cloud desktop and found its
IP to be in the IP range of AWS [3]. This implies that blocking
AWS will also harm the users of AWS-based virtual desktops.
Similar services are also offered by Google Cloud [6] and
Microsoft Azure [7].
We also examined a three-day snapshot of our institution’s
web logs to see if any requests originated from IPs belonging
to AWS [3], Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure [29]. We
exclude all requests for robots.txt or those containing the
(case-insensitive) substrings bot, crawler, spider, indexer or
b-o-t
in the USER-AGENT header. Among the 5.7M total
requests seen by our institution’s web server, we surprisingly
ﬁnd that 5.6% of client requests originated from IPs residing in
AWS, with smaller amounts coming from Google Cloud and
Microsoft Azure. More than two-thirds of these requests came
from users using Chrome, Internet Explorer/Edge, Firefox,
or Opera (based on the supplied USER-AGENT), suggesting
that most of these cloud-based requests resulted from actual
browsing activity. We posit
losing more than 5% of
potential site requests for the purposes of preventing Tor users
from accessing the site is too high a cost for the website
operator. In addition, with the trend of increasingly more
companies migrating their IT needs to cloud-based solutions,
it will likely become even more costly to blindly block all
accesses from the cloud.

VI. ANONYMITY AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
We discuss the privacy and security implications of our exit
bridge infrastructure, organized by the participating parties.
Exit relays.
Exit bridges receive trafﬁc from Tor circuits
that terminate at exit relays (see Figure 3). Our design adds
another hop to the anonymous path, reducing the role of an
exit relay from an egress point to effectively a second middle
relay. The TLS Relays that reside on the client and the exit
bridge encrypt all trafﬁc between them. This prevents the exit
relay from learning the client’s requested destination.
The exit relay could perform trafﬁc analysis (e.g., through-
put [30] or website ﬁngerprinting [9, 38, 52]), just as any other
middle relay. We consider such attacks orthogonal since they
equally apply to Tor’s current design.
Exit bridges. As with traditional exits, an exit bridge learns
the client’s destination, but not the identity of the client.
The risks of using exit bridges are similar to but distinct
from those of using meek bridges. A meek bridge allows the

cloud provider to observe ingress trafﬁc and enumerate the
users (or their IPs) of the meek bridge. This is arguably a
greater anonymity threat than, in the case of exit bridges, the
cloud provider learning the requested destinations. Although
we use AWS in our deployment, multiple independently
operated cloud providers can be used to host distinct exit
bridge networks, offering some decentralization. However,
such providers are limited, and funneling trafﬁc through the
cloud is a fundamental feature (and anonymity risk) of our
design.
To maintain Tor’s unlinkability, an exit bridge is dedicated
for a single user visiting a single website (see §IV-B). Thus,
a malicious exit bridge cannot link multiple sites visited by
a user. Similarly, colluding exit bridges cannot reliably link
trafﬁc as belonging to the same user since each connection to
a bridge uses an independent Tor circuit.
Finally, to prevent trivial trafﬁc correlation attacks [25, 33,
37], the Tor Browser should ensure that the ingress point
(e.g., a guard or bridge) is not hosted by the same provider
as the exit bridge. (Popular cloud providers publish their IP
address ranges.) We are planning on adding such checks to
our implementation.
Broker.
The broker operates as a hidden service, and all
connections to the broker occur over independent Tor circuits.
This prevents even a malicious broker from learning the
network locations of the clients, or linking two requests as
belonging to the same client. The broker assigns clients to
exit bridges—forcing users to use a malicious exit bridge is
equivalent to users selecting a malicious exit; this case is
covered above.
To prevent tracking by the broker using client side cookies,
the Tor Browser extension should prevent or delete cookies
from the broker site (this feature is currently under develop-
ment). We additionally rely on the extensive anti-ﬁngerprinting
techniques provided by the Tor Browser [39] to prevent other
methods of breaking unlinkability.
VII. ETHICS
We consider the ethical considerations of this paper from
two dimensions: the ethics of our experiments and the ethics
of a future Tor deployment of exit bridges.
Ethics of experimentation. We believe the experiments
described in §V are well within the bounds of ethical and
responsible research. As a guiding ethical framework, we
consider the Menlo Report [14], an extension of the Belmont
Report [34] for ethical research that is speciﬁcally tailored
for computer security research. The Menlo Report describes
four main principles of ethical studies: respect for persons,
beneﬁcence, justice, and respect for law and public interest.
Since our experiments do not concern human users or data
derived from human users (and thus is not covered by our
institutional review board), they trivially achieve the ﬁrst and
third criteria. To the best of our knowledge, our experiments
pose no signiﬁcant risks and do not violate any laws (at
least not in our jurisdiction); in general, we simply retrieved
publicly accessible webpages via AWS. Notably, the effects
of our experiments (visiting webpages) are identical to what
would have occurred had we retrieved the webpages using
virtual AWS Workspaces. In summary, we believe that our
experiments meet the ethical criteria of the Menlo Report and
additionally fall well within the norms of computer science
research.
Ethics of an exit bridge deployment. We separately con-
sider the ethics of a publicly accessible exit bridge deployment.
As with many privacy preserving and censorship evading
technologies, the ethics of such a system are multifaceted
and complex. In the remainder of this section, we attempt to
highlight some of the major ethical issues involved in allowing
users to bypass site-based blocking of Tor.
Are we circumventing security? There are many reasons
sites might block access from Tor, including fear of malicious
trafﬁc relayed through the anonymity network. By design, exit
bridges conceal that the trafﬁc traversed through Tor, and thus
could permit malicious trafﬁc to reach a destination which it
otherwise could not have. However, there are myriad other
ways in which attackers already can disguise the origins of
attack trafﬁc, including the use of open proxies, VPNs, and
botnets. We are skeptical that preventing access from Tor
provides websites with much security, but it is important to
acknowledge that exit bridges do bypass such protections.
We note that the CAPTCHA puzzle-solving requirement
provides some mitigation against automated activities (for

example, spamming and crawling) that often irk site opera-
tors. That is, the (human) work required to connect via an
exit relay—while not especially burdensome to an individual
user—makes it more difﬁcult (albeit not impossible) for an an
attacker to use the exit bridge infrastructure to do automated
activities.
If sites purposefully block access to Tor for philosophical
is it appropriate to permit such access? This is
reasons,
the reciprocal to “if a country disallows access to Tor, is it
ethical to provide access (e.g., through bridges) anyways?”
Both traditional bridges and exit bridges purposefully violate
policies, just at opposite ends of the communication. There
is also some similarity to the case of ad and web tracker
blockers, which can violate sites’ acceptable use policies but
which protect users’ privacy.
The pertinent section of the Menlo Report [14, see §C.5]
acknowledges that public interest (here, allowing users to
freely and privately access public websites) may conﬂict with
acceptable use and other policies.4 The Report requires in such
cases that there be “ethically defensible justiﬁcation” [14, see
§C.5.1], which is admittedly a very subjective criteria. In brief,
we believe that allowing users to browse privately is of such
immense public interest, that it justiﬁes the use of exit bridges.
Are we imposing a burden on the cloud service provider if
Tor users use exit bridges to perform illegal actions? Tor is
used by criminals to access illegal content (e.g., child abuse
imagery) and perform other illegal actions [36]. As happens
with exit relays, the illegal activity could be misattributed to
the exit bridge—and thus the cloud service provider—since
trafﬁc appears to be originating from the provider. From the
(U.S.-centric) legal perspective,
the cloud service provider
has little legal liability. In particular, the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA) provides indemniﬁcation (i.e., so-
called “safe harbor” protections) for entities that act solely
as a “conduit” for forwarding trafﬁc [50]. The Tor Project
does not know of any individuals being sued or prosecuted
for running exit relays [19], and the same would likely apply
to exit bridges.
A potential mitigation that reduces the burden and exposure
of the cloud service provider is to use a whitelisting strategy
in which exit bridges are conﬁgured to only create connections
to sites that block Tor. This would likely still permit access
to blocked sites while substantially reducing or even eliminat-
ing abuse complaints. And, as mentioned above, the use of
CAPTCHAs may stymie automated activities (e.g., crawling),
potentially reducing the number of complaints sent to the cloud
