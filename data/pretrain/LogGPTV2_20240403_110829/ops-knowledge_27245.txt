User: I'm writing a curses application in Python under UNIX. I want to enable the user to use C-Y to yank from a kill ring a la Emacs.
The trouble is, of course, that C-Y is caught by my shell which then sends SIGTSTP to my process. In addition, C-Z also results in SIGTSTP being sent, so catching the signal means that C-Y and C-Z are not distinguishable (though even without this the only solutions I can think of are extremely hackish).
I know what I'm asking is possible (in C if not in Python), since Emacs does it. How can I disable the shell's special handling of certain control characters sent from the keyboard and have the characters in question appear on the process' stdin?
Assistant: See the termios module, and the termios(3) man page.
