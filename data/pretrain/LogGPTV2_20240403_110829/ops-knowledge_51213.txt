User: I installed ubuntu 10.04 and it comes with python2.6. How can I upgrade it to 2.7?
Assistant: You can also install python2.7 package. Then you can define python version with shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python2.7) or even use #update-alternatives --config python to make it default interpreter. But it can break a lot of system apps...
update: sometimes, there's no alternative to python, so you'll need to create those by hand. Something like update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python2.7 /usr/bin/python2.7 10
update2: nevertheless if you just need 2.7 for your project, I'd suggest using virtualenv: virtualenv -ppython2.7 myproject
