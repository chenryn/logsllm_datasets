View Pod events and logs: Use the kubectl describe pod <pod name> command to view Pod events and logs to understand the cause and specifics of Pod errors. information to help troubleshoot problems. 2. Check the container configuration: Check whether the container configuration (such as image, entry point, and environment variables, etc.) is correct to ensure that the container can start and run normally. 3. Check storage and permissions: Check whether the storage and permissions used by the container are configured correctly, including the data volumes used, permissions to access the file system, and so on. 4. Check the resource limit: Check whether the resource limit of the Pod is too high or too low, and whether it causes the container to run unstable. 5. Update the image and application: If the problem is found to be caused by an unstable image or a bug in the application, updating the image or application can solve the problem. 6. Use probes: Use the probe function of Kubernetes to detect the status and health of containers, and find and solve problems in time. 7.
