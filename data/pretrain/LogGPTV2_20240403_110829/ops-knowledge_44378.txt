User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the most secure way for two people to communicate? There are various services on the internet that offer secure communications. Typically in the past if I want to share some sensitive information with someone, I  will do so over a Cryptocat chat session, Privnote, or through an IRC channel set up on a "no log" VPN. 

Am I looking in the right places when it comes to the services I use to keep my anonymity? Are there any flaws in these technologies? And what quite simply, what else is out there that you would recommend?

Edit: In reply to @Graham Hill, my immediate priority would be to first ensure that the information I am relaying gets to the person I am talking to, and only to that person. Obviously once they have it, it's up to their discretion on how they're going to store it, I'm more speaking in terms of making sure that the infrastructure is set up so that the only cause for data being leaked would be improper storage of the information by either party.

Assistant: Before looking at specific technological solutions, you need to do some thinking about your threat model. Who is the "enemy"? What do they want, and what resources do they have?

For example, keeping the content of the communications secret is one thing, hiding the fact that you are communicating is another, verifying the identity of the other person is yet a third.

And keeping secrets from your mom is one thing, keeping secrets from the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China is another.

You also need to understand your resources. Can you establish a short-term secure channel to the other party (so you can exchange keys)? Can you use cut-outs? Can you arrange to use a different computer each time you communicate?
