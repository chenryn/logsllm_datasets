**ATT&CK ID:** M1040  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Behavior Prevention on Endpoint

**Description:**
On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to enhance endpoint security. These rules can prevent executable files from running unless they meet specific criteria, such as prevalence, age, or inclusion in a trusted list. Additionally, ASR rules can block Office applications from creating potentially malicious executable content by preventing malicious code from being written to disk. 

**Note:**
To utilize certain ASR rules, cloud-delivered protection must be enabled.
