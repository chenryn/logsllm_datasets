The current web profiler displays all the dispatched listeners ordered by its
executions. Some times I need to attach a listener in a specific priority in
order to be dispatched before or after another listener. Would be good if the
web profiler displays the listener priorities also. That way I don't need to
inspect the source code of that listener to see which priority was assigned to
it.
