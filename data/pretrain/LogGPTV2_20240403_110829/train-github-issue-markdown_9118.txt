# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18362.476
    PowerToys version: 0.13.0.0
# Steps to reproduce
Keys randomly become disabled or behave unexpectedly. I think it issue only
affects the behavior of the Shift key. When it occurs, the issue is usually
noticeable when the `Shift` \+ `any key` to produce a character will fail (ex
`Shift` \+ `5` to produce `%`).
I have not been able to determine what leads to this behavior. The does not
begin immediately after the app is launched; it begins randomly, or after some
sequence of keystrokes from me that I haven't identified, but once the issue
begins, the only way to stop it is to exit PowerToys.
# Expected behavior
`Shift `\+ `any key` returns `expected character`  
Ex: `Shift` \+ `7` returns `&`
# Actual behavior
`Shift` \+ `any key` returns _no response_
