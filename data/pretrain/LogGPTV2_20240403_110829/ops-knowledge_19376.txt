User: I am programming a django based website. I actually use a small computer under Ubuntu 10.04.
I would like to buy something more professional, so I am wondering whether an iMac is good for that, because :

Is there a free IDE as good as eclipse on MacOS ?
Is there a remote python debugger like pydev for eclipse ?
Is there some typical issues with python on MacOS ?
does apache+mod_wsgi works well on MacOS ?
Assistant: All of the things you mentioned (Eclipse+plugins, Python, Apache, mod_wsgi) can run fine on OS X.
