node 1 over time. At t1 (event E1 in (a)), nodes 2, 3, and 4 meet in a mix zone and cooperate with node 1. Their
i ) − γ = log2(4) − γ = 1.8,
payoﬀ ui and the time of the last successful pseudonym change are updated: ui = Ai(T (cid:96)
i := t1, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. The payoﬀ of node 1 then decreases according to β1 with slope λ. At t2 (event E2),
and T (cid:96)
node 1 defects. At t3 (event E3), node 1 cooperates with nodes 6 and 7. Consequently, the 3 nodes update
their payoﬀ and the time of the last successful pseudonym change. At t4, (event E4) node 1 cooperates but
nodes 8 does not. Hence, the payoﬀ of node 1 decreases by γ. Finally, at T f
1 = t5, the payoﬀ of node 1 reaches
0 (event E5).
• Payoﬀ Function: We model the payoﬀ function of every
node i as ui(t) = bi(t)−ci(t), where the beneﬁt bi(t) depends
on the level of location privacy of node i at time t, whereas
the cost ci(t) depends on the privacy loss function and the
cost of changing pseudonym at time t. If at least two nodes
change pseudonyms, then each participating node improves
its location privacy for the cost of a pseudonym change γ. If
a node is alone in changing its pseudonym, then it still pays
the cost γ and, in addition, its location privacy continues
to decrease according to the location privacy loss function.
If a node defects, its location privacy continues to decrease
according to its location privacy loss function. Formally, we
have:

the number of pseudonyms wasted by node i since its last
successful pseudonym change T (cid:96)
(Note that in contrast

with the equality sign =, the sign := refers to the assignment

We can represent the static pseudonym change game in a
normal form. Table 2 shows an example for two players in
power range of each other. Each player has two strategies:
C or D. The value pairs in the cell represent the payoﬀ of
the player 1 and 2, respectively. We assume ui

players and can dispense with the max(0,·) component of
player payoﬀ after an unsuccessful pseudonym change.

Figure 2 (a) shows seven users moving in a network and
playing a total of four pseudonym change games. Table 2
corresponds to the game played in event E3 in Figure 2
(a). Figure 2 (b) illustrates the evolution of the payoﬀ of
node 1 playing the four games. Because we analyze only
a single strategic interaction between players in this paper,
we simplify notation and write n = n(t), βi = βi(t, T (cid:96)
i ),
αi = αi(t, T (cid:96)
• Type: Upon meeting other players, the strategy of a
player depends on its knowledge of its opponent payoﬀ func-
tion. As both the time of the last pseudonym change and the
corresponding location privacy gain are unknown to other
players, each player has incomplete information about its
opponents payoﬀs. To solve the problem, Harsanyi [25] sug-
gests the introduction of a new player named Nature that
turns an incomplete information game into an imperfect in-
formation game. To do so, Nature assigns a type θi to ev-
ery player i according to a probability density function f (θi)
known to all players, where θi belongs to space of types Θ.
The type of the players captures the private information of
the player, θi = u
is the payoﬀ to player i at
time t− just prior to the current opportunity to change pseu-
donym. Because γ is common and known to all nodes, this
completely deﬁnes the payoﬀ of the node.

In this section, we introduce the game-theoretic concepts
that will help us get an insight into the strategic behavior
of mobile nodes. In a complete information game, a pure-
strategy for player i is si ∈ Si, where Si = {C, D} is the
pure-strategy space. A strategy proﬁle s = {si}n

the set of strategies of the players. Let us write bri(s−i), the

best response of player i to the opponent’s strategy s−i.
Definition 1. The best response bri(s−i) of player i to
the proﬁle of strategies s−i is a strategy si such that:
bri(s−i) = arg max
si
ui(si, s−i)
(10)
If two strategies are mutual best responses to each other,
then no player has the motivation to deviate from the given
strategy proﬁle. This leads us to the concept of Nash Equi-
librium [44].
Definition 2. A strategy proﬁle s∗ is a Nash equilibrium
(NE) if, for each player i:

In other words, in a NE, none of the players can unilaterally
change his strategy to increase his payoﬀ. A player can
also play each of his pure strategies with some probability
using mixed strategies. A mixed strategy xi of player i is a
probability distribution deﬁned over the pure strategies si.

plete information games, the NE concept does not apply as
such because players are unaware of the payoﬀ of their op-
ponents. Instead, we adopt the concept of Bayesian Nash
equilibrium [25, 30]. Consider that Nature assigns a type to
every player according to a common probability distribution
f (θi). Because the type of a player determines its payoﬀ, ev-
ery player computes its best move based on its belief about
the type (and thus the strategy) of its opponents.

6. ANALYSIS OF COMPLETE INFORMA-
TION GAME
We begin the analysis with a complete information model
called the pseudonym change C-game (C stands for complete
information). Each player with common knowledge about
the type of all players chooses a strategy simultaneously (i.e.
C-game). We obtain NE for the 2-player game, and general-
ize the results for n-player C-games. We consider that upon
a pseudonym change, every node achieves the same level of
privacy and thus we consider the upperbound Ai = log2(k),
where k ≤ n is the number of cooperating nodes.
6.1
2-player C-game
The strategic representation of the two player C-game is
shown in Table 3. Two players P1 and P2, meeting in a
mix zone at time t, take part in a pseudonym change game.
Each mobile node decides independently whether to change
its pseudonym without knowing the decision of its opponent.
The game is played once and the two players make their
moves simultaneously. The value in the cells represents the
payoﬀ of each player. As usual, the players want to maximize
−
their payoﬀ. We assume here that u
i > γ for both players,
is itself bounded from above by
so that u
log2(2) − γ = 1 − γ in a 2-player game, we require γ  0. Since u

Each player knows u

its payoﬀ for diﬀerent strategy proﬁles because the cost γ
is common knowledge. Theorem 1 identiﬁes the potential
equilibrium strategies for the players. The proof is provided
in Appendix A.
Theorem 1. The 2-player pseudonym change C-game has
two pure-strategy Nash equilibria (C, C) and (D, D) and one

Coordination games model situations in which all parties
can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually con-
sistent decisions. Coordination games always have three NE
as obtained with Theorem 1. (C, C) is the Pareto-optimal
strategy and thus the preferred equilibrium. If the probabil-
ity of cooperation xi of each player equals 1, then the mixed
equilibrium equals (C, C). Figure 3 illustrates the best re-
sponse correspondence of the two players. For example, if
−
both players have a low u
i (meaning a high propensity to co-
operate), the mixed-strategy equilibrium approaches (0, 0).
In such a scenario, the basin of attraction of the (C, C) NE
(i.e., the surface of the rectangle between the mixed NE and
the (C, C) NE) is larger than that of the (D, D) NE. In
other words, (C, C) would be the most likely NE in settings
where players ﬁnd their best response with an adaptive be-
havior. The complete information pseudonym change game
is asymmetric because the payoﬀ of each player depends on
its private type. For example, the mixing probability is dif-
ferent for each node (i.e., x1 (cid:54)= x2).
6.2
We extend the 2-player C-game by considering a set of
n ≤ N players meeting in a mix zone at time t. Each player
−
has complete information and knows the payoﬀ function u
of its n − 1 opponents. Let C k and Dn−k denote the sets
i
of k cooperating players and n− k defecting players, respec-
tively. The proofs of lemmas and theorems are provided in
the Appendix. Lemma 1 identiﬁes the existence of an All
Defection NE.
