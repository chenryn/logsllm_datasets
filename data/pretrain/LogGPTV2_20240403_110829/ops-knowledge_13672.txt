For example, enter "cd /home/user/example" to switch to the /home/user/example directory. If you enter "cd" directly, it will return to the current user's home directory by default. 2. ls: Display directories and files The function of this command is to list all files and subdirectories under the specified directory. For example, "ls /home/user/example" can list all files and subdirectories under the /home/user/example directory and display their detailed information. 3. cat: View file content The function of this command is to output the content of the specified file to the terminal. For example, "cat file.txt" will output the contents of file.txt to the screen. 4. tar: file packaging and compression tool The function of this command is to package a group of files or directories into a tar file, and can compress and decompress the tar file. For example, "tar -cvf file.tar /dir" can pack all the files and subdirectories under the /dir directory into a tar file, and "tar -zxvf file.tar.gz" can decompress the file.tar.gz compressed package. 5. ssh: remote login tool The function of this command is to establish a secure connection with another computer and log in to the remote server. For example, "ssh user@192.168.0.1" can log in to the server with IP 192.168.0.1 through the SSH protocol, and log in as user user.
