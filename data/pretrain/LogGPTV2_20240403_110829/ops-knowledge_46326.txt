User: How to list all running Docker containers and their corresponding container IDs?
Assistant: All running Docker containers and their corresponding container IDs can be listed with the following command: ``` docker ps -q ``` This will return a list with all running Docker container IDs. If you want to display both container names and IDs, you can use the following command: ``` docker ps --format '{{.ID}} {{.Names}}' ``` This will display output similar to the following format: ` `` CONTAINER_ID CONTAINER_NAME ``` where CONTAINER_ID is the ID of the container and CONTAINER_NAME is the name of the container.
