User: I would like to monitor system IO load from a python program, accessing statistics similar to those provided in /proc/diskstats in linux (although obviously a cross-platform library would be great).  Is there an existing python library that I could use to query disk IO statistics on linux?
Assistant: What's wrong with just periodically reading /proc/diskstats, e.g. using sched to repeat the operation every minute or whatever?  Linux's procfs is nice exactly because it provides a textual way for the kernel to supply info to userland programs, as text is easiest to read and use in a huge variety of languages...!
