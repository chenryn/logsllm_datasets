ABSTRACT
Packet sampling is widely used in network monitoring. Sam-
pled packet streams are often used to determine ﬂow-level
statistics of network traﬃc. To date there is conﬂicting evi-
dence on the quality of the resulting estimates. In this paper
we take a systematic approach, using the Fisher information
metric and the Cram´er-Rao bound, to understand the con-
tributions that diﬀerent types of information within sampled
packets have on the quality of ﬂow-level estimates. We pro-
vide concrete evidence that, without protocol information
and with packet sampling rate p = 0.005, any accurate un-
biased estimator needs approximately 1016 sampled ﬂows.
The required number of sampled ﬂows drops to roughly 104
with the use of TCP sequence numbers. Furthermore, addi-
tional SYN ﬂag information signiﬁcantly reduces the estima-
tion error of short ﬂows. We present a Maximum Likelihood
Estimator (MLE) that relies on all of this information and
show that it is eﬃcient, even when applied to a small sample
set. We validate our results using Tier-1 Internet backbone
traces and evaluate the beneﬁts of sampling from multiple
monitors. Our results show that combining estimates from
several monitors is 50% less accurate than an estimate based
on all samples.

INTRODUCTION
Data reduction is an indispensable component of today’s
Internet measurement and monitoring. With the increase
in network utilization, it is very diﬃcult for monitoring ap-
plications to process every packet in the aggregated back-
bone links at OC48+ levels. Recently, many data stream-
ing algorithms have focused on summarizing network traﬃc
with a very small memory footprint [18], [12], often beneﬁ-
cial to inline monitoring at the router. While lightweight,
this aggregation requires prior knowledge of the interested
statistics before it can be implemented at the monitoring
point. On the other hand, sampling methods require very
little inline computation, but transmit a subset of traﬃc to
a powerful backend server for analysis. This allows users
both ﬂexibility and extensibility in deploying measurement
and monitoring applications at the server. Sampling also
helps reduce the processing load, and memory and storage
demands of monitoring systems. However, some information
content is inherently lost with sampling. This work presents
a theoretical framework within which to assess how much
information of a given ﬂow level metric remains after sam-
pling. While we primarily focus on the estimation of the ﬂow
size distribution, our framework should apply to other met-
rics as well, such as traﬃc matrix estimation. Moreover, we
quantify the value of TCP header ﬁelds for the estimation
of ﬂow size distributions.
Many sampling schemes have been proposed, from gen-
eral purpose packet sampling and ﬂow sampling, to methods
aimed at identifying traﬃc elephants, such as smart sam-
pling [5] and sample-and-hold [6]. Two standardization ef-
forts, PSAMP [21] and IPFIX [20], are current underway as
well. Among these, random or periodic (close to random)
packet sampling, (sFlow [22]), ﬂow summarization of packet
level information (Cisco NetFlow [19]), and a combination
of both (Cisco sampled NetFlow) are popular methods de-
ployed in commercial networks. Random packet sampling
consists of independently selecting each packet for process-
ing with probability p. Periodic sampling is shown to have
similar characteristics as random sampling [3]. While packet
sampling generally provides detailed and accurate packet
level characteristics, it is not clear whether it can reveal de-
tailed ﬂow level characteristics.
The ﬂow size distribution is an important metric that has
received some attention in recent years. Flow size is the
number of packets in a ﬂow. We are interested in estimat-
ing the ﬂow size distribution, i.e. the fraction of ﬂows that
contains i packets during a measurement interval, with i
typically being small. This is an important metric for many
applications, such as traﬃc engineering, and denial of ser-
vice attack and worm/virus outbreak detections. It has been
previously thought to be very diﬃcult to estimate the ﬂow
size distribution accurately from sampled traﬃc [9]. In the
ﬁrst work in the ﬁeld, Duﬃeld et al.
[3] provided several
estimators, but did not provide a proof of their accuracy.
In this work we use the Fisher information metric to ad-
dress many open questions concerning ﬂow size distribution
estimation from packet sampling. This is possible because
of the tie between Fisher information and estimation mean
squared error through the Cram´er-Rao lower bound. Using
the Fisher information, we identify certain TCP ﬁelds that
are high in information content value beneﬁcial to ﬂow size
estimation. We show TCP protocol information to be es-
sential for accurate unbiased ﬂow size estimators. Further
we bring the ﬁrst study to our knowledge of the beneﬁts
of computing ﬂow size distribution estimates by combining
samples from multiple monitors. We observe that our frame-
work simpliﬁes the task of analyzing and developing estima-
tion algorithms for sampling at both a single monitor and
at multiple monitors. Products of our study are estimators
that are close to optimal, even when given a small number
of samples. We validate our results using traces taken from
a Tier-1 backbone network. We focus on TCP ﬂows as they
account for 80-90% of packets in the network [23].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
In Sec-
tion 2 we introduce the general model of obtaining ﬂow-level
statistics under a random packet sampling scheme. Then we
lay out the information theory framework and compute the
Fisher Information in Section 3. The development of an eﬃ-
cient estimator that achieves the Cram´er Rao bound, Maxi-
mum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), follows in Section 4. We
evaluate using real traces in Section 5, and evaluate the ben-
eﬁt from multiple monitors in Section 6. Finally we conclude
with Section 7.
2. MODELING SAMPLED FLOWS
We introduce a model of ﬂow sizes and sampled ﬂows pro-
duced through packet sampling. We ﬁrst deﬁne the relevant
entities and then enhance the model to include SYN and
sequence number information.
The conventional IP ﬂow deﬁnition is a set of packets that
obey the following rules:
• Any two packets have the same 5-tuple, i.e., the same
IP Source, IP Destination, source port number, desti-
nation port number, and protocol number.
• Maximum inter-packet arrival time must be less than
a threshold t, where t is a value given by the network
operator, typically between 30 to 60 seconds.
Flow evicts ﬂows that are active for more than time t, typi-
cally 30min, to free memory for new ﬂows. Here we choose
the conventional deﬁnition to keep our model straightfor-
ward.
We monitor packets at a chosen point in the network.
Packets are sampled according to a Bernoulli process with
sampling probability p, 0 < p < 1. We refer to the ﬂows
prior to sampling as original ﬂows. A sampled (or thinned)
ﬂow is a ﬂow that has at least one packet sampled. A ﬂow
of size i is a ﬂow that originally has i packets. Likewise, a
sampled ﬂow of size m is a ﬂow that has m packets sampled,
where m ≥ 1. Some original ﬂows are not sampled and
therefore not observed. Some original ﬂows may split into
multiple sampled ﬂows. We do not account for ﬂow splitting.
Table 1 summarizes most of the deﬁnitions used throughout
this paper.

Let L be a set of label tuples. A label j ∈ L can be,
for instance, the number of packets obtained in a sampled
ﬂow. Let j ∈ L be a label given to a sampled ﬂow and
let dj be the fraction of sampled ﬂows with label j. For
now consider j to be the number of packets obtained from a
sampled ﬂow and let (cid:2)d = (d1, . . . , dW ) denote the sampled
ﬂow size distribution. Distributions (cid:2)d and (cid:2)θ are related by

An estimator without protocol information. In [3]
the authors present a set of estimators based on the above
samples, i.e., without TCP protocol information. We refer
to an estimator without protocol information as an “ALL-
pktct” estimator. “ALL” refers to the use of all TCP sam-
pled ﬂows. And “pktct” refers to an estimator that uses
only packet counts.
Next we extend the model to account for protocol infor-
mation, particularly TCP SYN ﬂags and sequence numbers.
2.2 TCP SYN ﬂag and sequence numbers
The basic model only accounts for the number of packets
inside a sampled TCP ﬂow. A sampled ﬂow can carry more
information about its original IP ﬂow size, through stateful
upper layer protocols. TCP [15], in particular, has two ﬁelds
that provide further information regarding length: control
ﬂags and sequence numbers.
SYN sampled ﬂows. As pointed out in [3], the TCP
SYN ﬂag provides valuable information during the estima-
tion phase. As in [3], we assume original ﬂows include ex-
actly one SYN packet, which is the ﬁrst packet of the ﬂow.
We denote a sampled ﬂow starting with a SYN packet as a
SYN sampled ﬂow. Because there is only one SYN packet
