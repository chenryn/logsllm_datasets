### Title: UWB Real-Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice

**Abstract:**

Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a rapidly growing radio technology that, according to the UWB Alliance, is projected to drive sales volumes exceeding one billion devices annually by 2025. Among its current applications, off-the-shelf Real-Time Locating Systems (RTLS) use UWB to provide localization solutions for a wide range of use cases, including medical patient tracking, safety geofencing, asset monitoring, and contact tracing.

The security of UWB wireless communications has recently been enhanced by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4z amendment. However, critical phases of the RTLS process are managed by proprietary network protocols that are not governed by industry standards, leaving the design and implementation responsibilities to the vendors.

To strengthen the security of UWB-based devices, Nozomi Networks Labs conducted a comprehensive security assessment of two popular UWB RTLS solutions available on the market. Our research uncovered several 0-day vulnerabilities and other weaknesses that, if exploited, could allow an attacker to gain full access to all sensitive location data transmitted over the air.

In this presentation, we will demonstrate how an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to locate and target individuals, circumvent safety geofencing rules, and interfere with contact tracing. We will also present key actions and best practices to help mitigate these weaknesses and secure UWB RTLS from potential cyber attacks.

**Key Points:**
- **Introduction to UWB Technology:** Overview of UWB and its projected growth.
- **Current Applications of RTLS:** Use cases such as medical patient tracking, safety geofencing, asset monitoring, and contact tracing.
- **Security Enhancements and Gaps:** Discussion of the IEEE 802.15.4z amendment and the lack of standardization in critical RTLS processes.
- **Vulnerability Assessment Findings:** Details of the 0-day vulnerabilities and other weaknesses discovered.
- **Exploitation Scenarios:** Demonstration of how attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Key actions and best practices to secure UWB RTLS from cyber attacks.

This presentation aims to raise awareness about the potential security risks associated with UWB RTLS and provide actionable insights to enhance their security.
