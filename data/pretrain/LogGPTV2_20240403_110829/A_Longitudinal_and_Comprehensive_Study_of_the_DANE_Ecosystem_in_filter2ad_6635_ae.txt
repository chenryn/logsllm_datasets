**Table 3 Notes:**
- If an email provider does not support STARTTLS, we do not test if they accept an expired, self-signed, or Common Name mismatched certificate (hence the –).
- Similarly, if they do not fetch TLSA records, we do not test if they accept the wrong TLSA records (hence the –).

### Observations and Analysis

1. **DNS Resolver Vulnerability:**
   - 9 out of 29 mail service providers use DNS resolvers outside their own network, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks (refer to the "Same Op." column in Table 3).

2. **STARTTLS Support:**
   - 24 out of 29 mail service providers support STARTTLS, aligning with a prior study [30] which showed that 81.8% of Alexa 1M domains support STARTTLS.
   - However, none of the 24 email service providers correctly verify presented certificates; they complete the TLS handshake even with expired, self-signed, or Common Name mismatched certificates. This is likely due to the lack of specifying how to handle invalid certificates in STARTTLS [37].
   - Our results are consistent with prior work [30], where only 52% of popular email servers present valid certificates. This highlights the need to deploy DANE for securing incoming and outgoing emails.

3. **DANE Support:**
   - Only four email service providers (mail.com, comcast.net, gmx.com, tutanota.com) fetch TLSA records.
   - These providers correctly reject TLSA records if their Selector, Matching Type, or Certificate Association Data fields are invalid.
   - They also refuse to connect if the test server does not initiate a TLS connection (No Cert column).
   - However, mail.com and tutanota.com do not check whether the Certificate Usage value of the TLSA record is consistent with the certificate. For example, they accept a self-signed certificate with a TLSA record setting its Certificate Usage to PKIX-EE, which should be rejected.
   - Two possible hypotheses for this behavior:
     1. They might ignore TLSA records with Certificate Usage set to PKIX-TA or PKIX-EE.
     2 - They skip the PKIX certificate validation except for checking the Certificate Association Data.
   - An additional experiment confirmed that these two mail servers skip the PKIX validation, except for checking the Certificate Association Data.

### 6.2 Popular MTAs and DNS Software

To deploy DANE in the SMTP protocol at a larger scale, the software of Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) and DNS resolvers/servers must be correctly implemented. Specifically:

- **DNS Servers and Resolvers:**
  - Must understand TLSA records and support DNSSEC to validate DNS responses.
  
- **SMTP Software:**
  - Must look up and validate TLSA records along with the corresponding certificates.
  - Sending MTAs (SMTP clients) must:
    1. Look up TLSA records by themselves or use their DNS resolvers to do so.
    2. Send the STARTTLS command to receiving MTAs (SMTP servers).
    3. Validate the certificates of the receiving MTAs with the corresponding TLSA records.
  - Receiving MTAs (SMTP servers) must:
    1. Deploy DNS servers that can serve TLSA records and support DNSSEC to sign their DNS records.
    2. Support STARTTLS to present certificates consistent with the TLSA records.

**Observations:**

1. All SMTP programs rely on external recursive resolvers to resolve TLSA records. To reduce attack vectors, it is recommended that sending MTAs install their own recursive resolver supporting DNSSEC and DANE.
2. All MTA programs support STARTTLS for both incoming and outgoing emails.
3. Seven out of ten DNS software implementations support both DNSSEC and DANE correctly.

These findings underscore the importance of deploying DANE and ensuring proper implementation in both MTA and DNS software to enhance email security.
