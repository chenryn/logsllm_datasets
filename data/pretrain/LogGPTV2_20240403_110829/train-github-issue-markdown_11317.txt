challenge only passed when I removed BOTH console.log statements. Removing
only the second one as requested did not work.  
My code:
    function myFunction() {
      var myVar = "spam";
    }
    myFunction();
    // run and check the console 
    // myVar is not defined outside of myFunction
    // now remove the console.log line to pass the test
