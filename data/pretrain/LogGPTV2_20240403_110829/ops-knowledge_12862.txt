User: How to perform disk management and performance optimization of Linux system? Please provide the basic usage of df, du, fdisk and iostat.
Assistant: The disk management and performance optimization of the Linux system mainly include the following steps: 1. Disk partitioning and formatting: use fdisk to partition the hard disk, and use mkfs to format the file system. 2. Mount the file system: Use the mount command to mount the file system to the specified directory. 3. Disk space management: Use the df command to check the disk space usage, use the du command to check the disk space usage of directories or files, and use the rm command to delete unnecessary files. 4. Performance optimization: Use the iostat command to view disk I/O performance indicators, and improve disk performance by adjusting file system parameters, optimizing the number of reads and writes, and disk scheduling algorithms. The following introduces the basic usage methods of df, du, fdisk and iostat: 1. df command: used to view the disk space usage of the file system. Syntax: df [option] [file system] Option description: -h displays more readable disk space size -i displays inode information Example: $ df -h 2. du command: used to view the disk space of a directory or file occupancy. Syntax: du [option] [file name] Option description: -h displays more readable disk space size -s only displays the total size of directories or files Example: $ du -sh /var/log 3. fdisk command: Used to partition hard drives and manage disk partition tables. Syntax: fdisk [option] disk device node option description: -l list all hard disks and partition information -n create a new partition -d delete a partition -p print out partition table information -w write partition table to disk Example: $ fdisk -l /dev/sda 4. iostat command: used to view system disk I/O performance indicators. Syntax: iostat [options] [interval time] [times] Option description: -c display CPU utilization -d display disk utilization -t display timestamp Example: $iostat -d -x 1 10
