Finally, we investigate closer this group of spam cam-
paigns with few origins. Interestingly, the classiﬁer for most
of them gave a weak score, between 0 and -0.5. The graph re-
ﬁnement was ineﬀective for them, because these campaigns
did not appear at all in our graph. At a closer manual in-
spection, these cases mainly corresponded to phishing and
Nigerian scams. Several of these campaigns are sent in low
volume and for short periods of time using webmail accounts,
thus hiding under benign IP addresses.
4.2 Recipient-Oriented Attributes
The email recipient can be speciﬁed in three diﬀerent
headers: To, Cc, and Bcc. Interestingly, we found no cam-
paigns using the Cc header, and some campaigns that seem
to randomly change the location of the recipient over time

fore, we apply a community ﬁnding algorithm [5] that groups
all the nodes into interconnected communities, also called
groups, decomposing the Giant Component into smaller parts.
We end up with 660 groups, for most of which we can ac-
curately associate a single class. When gray campaigns are
in the same group with any other class, we assign gray cam-
paigns to the class of its group.
While this technique works well for most of the groups,
some noise is still introduced in the results by the presence
of loosely connected nodes. These are nodes that get erro-
neously connected to a group due to emails reusing the sub-
jects of legitimate campaigns. To remove these connections,
for each node we compute a graph metric called clustering
coeﬃcient. The coeﬃcient for loosely connected nodes is
equal to 0, whereas it approaches 1 for tightly connected
nodes. As a result, we re-classify all the gray nodes with a
clustering coeﬃcient greater than zero and that belong to
a group of either legitimate or spam campaigns. To decide
on the class of the group, we compute the mean of classi-
ﬁer score of all nodes in the group: groups above 0.2 are
considered legitimate, and groups below this threshold are
considered spam.
Using this approach we were able to re-classify over half
of the gray campaigns (427). This reduced the false posi-
tives from 0.9% to 0.2% (see Table 5 for more information).
The entire dataset is now split into legitimate (80%), spam
(17%) and gray (2.9%) messages (an increase of 3% for le-
gitimate campaigns and 1% for spam). Again, our method
performs better with legitimate messages. This is due to le-
gitimate campaigns forming stronger networks (reusing the
same mailing infrastructure over time) than malicious cam-
paign.
4. ATTRIBUTE ANALYSIS
In this section we analyze the characteristics of spam and
legitimate campaigns, and compare our ﬁndings to the ones
presented in previous spam studies [21, 24].
The Random Forest classiﬁer provides some information
about the relevance of each feature. Interestingly, the least
important attributes are the ones in Group B, and in par-

(we categorize them as Mixed ). We also looked at the num-
ber of recipients per incoming email and at the number of
non-existing email accounts (rejected at MTA-in because of
non-existent user) in multiple recipient emails. We look at
these three features together as they are often more infor-
mative when combined than when taken individually.
Around 75% of the legitimate campaigns use the To header
(Table 6), whereas spammers often mix diﬀerent headers in
the same campaign. The Bcc header is adopted by both
campaign types, although less frequently. However, it is
very common among gray campaigns: in fact, half of them
use exclusively this header to specify the recipient. Again,
this is very common between the previously mentioned scam
campaigns.
Since the campaigns located in the gray zone often use
the Bcc ﬁeld, they have shorter recipient lists including on
average only 1.2 recipients per email. In contrast, 94% of le-
gitimate campaigns have a single recipient, while spammers
tend to include an average of at least three recipients per
email.
However, these features alone cannot be used to reliably
separate spam from legitimate messages. For example, 36%
of spam campaigns used only one recipient per email, and in
30% of the cases speciﬁed in the To header. Interestingly, by
combining these two criteria with the fact that these cam-
paigns also have high IP preﬁx distribution, we can deduct
that they originate from infected machines or botnets.
When some of the messages in a campaign are rejected, it
is an indicator that the sender’s recipient list was unveriﬁed
or not up-to-date. Although sometimes users make typos
while providing their email addresses, a higher rejection ra-
tio, as shown in Figure 2 (c), along with multiple recipients
is a good indicator of spammer activity. In fact, only 1%
of spam campaigns sent with two recipients per email have
a rejection ratio lower than 0.1. Thus, the combination of
these two characteristics performs well for campaign classi-
ﬁcation.
4.3 Newsletter Subscription Header
One of our features counts the presence of the List-Unsubs-
cribe header in the emails. This header is intended specif-

ically to indicate bulk email senders in order to treat such
emails separately, and normally points to a URL or email
address that can be used to unsubscribe from a mailing list1.
This header is recommended to be used by regular bulk
senders. Another recommendation for bulk email is to use
the Precedence: bulk header. However, since in our dataset
this header was used only in a few messages, we focus on
the more common List-Unsubscribe header.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of each campaign type that
uses the unsubscribe header. Only 10% of the spam cam-
paigns adopt the header, counting only for a total of 0.6% of
the spam messages. While legitimate campaigns tend to use
the header in most of their emails, around half of the cam-
paigns do not use it at all. This is due to several diﬀerent
email marketing companies advertising the same campaign,
where some include the header, and some do not. In total,
around half of the legitimate campaigns include the header
(Table 7), and 27% of all legitimate campaigns have the
header present in all messages.
In conclusion, we ﬁnd it uncommon for spammers to use
the Unsubscribe header, but at the same time legitimate
campaigns use it in only half of their emails. While this at-
tribute seems to be a good feature to identify marketing
campaigns, spooﬁng the Unsubscribe header is extremely
easy and could be done with minimal additional costs for
spammers.
5. EMAIL CAMPAIGNS
In this section we present four categories of email cam-
paigns that we identify in the gray area. We already sep-
arated spam from legitimate campaigns. We further divide
1In general an unsubscribe option is also included in the
body of the message, but we could not check for this case
since we had no access to email bodies.

companies also provide a pre-compiled list of emails (already
categorized by user interests) that can be used to acquire
new clients.
Therefore, email recipients can be taken both from cold
lists (i.e., people who are not yet customers), or from cur-
rent customer lists. As a result, diﬀerent marketers send
many diﬀerent email campaigns, thus forming a large inter-
connected network of campaigns, as captured by our graph.
As the senders also rely on cold lists, it is crucial to ensure
that recipients can unsubscribe from the unsolicited adver-
tisements. Indeed, commercial campaigns have the highest
rate of unsubscribe headers.
On average, this class of campaigns lasts for 26 days,
but some also continue for several months. Diﬀerent email
marketing companies are often involved in sending a sin-
gle campaign, where each company is only active during a
certain time frame. Also, each marketing service provider
has its own dedicated range of IP addresses, which explains
sometimes high IP address variance and high geographical
distribution of campaigns in this group. As a comparison,
newsletters (Figure 4, upper-left part) use on average three
times less of unique IP addresses than a professional mar-
keter.
To conclude, commercial campaigns can be highly dis-
tributed, but, at the same time, they often adopt consis-
tent email patterns with similar sender names and email
addresses.
5.2 Newsletter Campaigns
The newsletter senders rely mostly on static and small
mailing infrastructure. The sender is often the actual com-
pany distributing the emails, with typically a small and ﬁxed
IP address range. This category contains half of the emails
of the previous one (probably because most of the legitimate
mailing lists do not get into the quarantined area as they are
already whitelisted by their customers) and covers around
Figure 3: Newsletter subscription header distribution. Only
the cases where the header is present are plotted
the spam in two categories: the one generated by distributed
and dynamic infrastructures (likely sent by botnet or in-
fected machines) from the smaller campaigns sent by few
IPs.
We also split the legitimate campaigns into two groups.
The ﬁrst sent by private marketing companies as a service to
distributes legitimate bulk advertisements, i.e., commercial
campaigns. The second including newsletters that are sent
to the users subscribed to a web services or mailing lists, and
the automatically generated notiﬁcations (e.g.
for online
registrations). Again, the ﬁrst ones are delivered by large
infrastructures, while the second ones are often sent from a
limited and constant set of IP addresses.
To identify these four categories in our dataset, we adopt
a number of simple heuristics. As commercial campaigns
we mark legitimate campaigns that belong to the biggest
interconnected component of the graph described in Sec-
tion 3.4. These are campaigns that are spread over many
diﬀerent networks and domain names as such campaigns
are sometimes sent by several diﬀerent e-marketing services
providers, thus forming a large graph of interconnected cam-
paigns. We consider the remaining scattered legitimate cam-
paigns as newsletters and notiﬁcations as they rely on more
static and isolated email delivery infrastructures. Botnet-
generated campaigns are instead approximated by the spam
clusters that are sent from more than six diﬀerent countries
and by more than 20 unique /24 IP preﬁxes. Finally, we
manually sample over 350 of the remaining spam campaigns
to identify scam and phishing campaigns.
All the categories are visualized in Figure 4, and the mean
values of their features are summarized in Table 8.
5.1 Commercial Campaigns
This is the largest category in our dataset covering 42%
of the identiﬁed campaigns, with an average of 148 emails
each. By looking manually at these clusters, we conﬁrm that
these messages are mainly generated by professional email
marketers sending. We were able to identify some of the
main players (both national and international), and often
conﬁrmed that they actually run a legal business. On their
websites, they repeatedly underline the fact that “they are
