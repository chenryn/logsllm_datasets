app execution and applied the OLED display power model from [15] for the
Pixel 5 phone used in our study to estimate the OLED display power. Finally,
we model the camera power draw as a constant [13]. Since the LTE/5G NIC
power drain is known to be sensitive to external conditions such as the signal
strength [17], practical power models based on regression on observed through-
put [19,26] are coarse-grained, and the app does not use other power-hungry
phone components such as the hardware decoder, we instead directly measure
the instantaneous device power using the built-in power sensor via the Linux
power supply class [7] and subtract from it the power drawn by CPU, GPU,
Camera, and OLED display to derive the power draw by the cellular NIC.
We adopted the above power modeling methodology for three reasons. (1) We
needed to measure component-wise power draw to compute the network power
draw by the AR app from the total power. SnapDragon Proﬁler, Monsoon Power
Monitor [23], or BattOR [35] can only provide the total power consumption, as
they do not provide power counters for the individual components. (2) Using
power modeling eases experimentation, as attaching a Monsoon power monitor to
a phone would require dismantling and instrumenting the device, which would be
diﬃcult for ﬁeld experiments. (3) The power models themselves are benchmarked
against the Monsoon power monitor, making them reasonably accurate. For
example, we used the OLED display model from [15], which has error less than
5% for Pixel 5 on average, and the CPU and GPU models use the Linux event
trace to estimate the power consumption with very high resolution.

5.2 Results
Figure 9 shows the average (over 5 runs) energy drain by the host and the resolver
during the AR app execution and the breakdown into 7 app phases, over 5G
mmWave (facing towards the BS) and LTE. We make the following observations.
Fig. 9. Energy breakdown
Host vs. Resolver. Overall the app drains much more total energy on the host
than on the resolver, by 70% (31 J vs. 9 J) and 80% (24 J vs. 5 J), over 5G and
LTE, respectively. This happens as the 3 phases 1a, 1b, and 1c on the host drain
signiﬁcantly higher energy than the later 4 phases (2a – 2d) on the resolver.
Total Energy Comparison. On the host, the app drains 23% more total energy
when running over 5G compared to running over LTE. The energy breakdown
by phone components shows that the major contributor to the diﬀerence is the
network energy, which over 5G is 60% higher than over LTE. Similarly, on the
resolver, the app drains 43% more total energy when running over 5G compared
to running over LTE, although the absolute diﬀerence is much smaller compared
to on the host side. The major diﬀerence again comes from the network energy
drain, which over 5G is signiﬁcantly higher than over LTE, by 83%.
Per-app Phase Comparison. To understand where the energy diﬀerence hap-
pens in the diﬀerent phases of the app, we look at the energy breakdown by app
phases. Figure 9 shows that on the host side higher energy drain over 5G com-
pared to over LTE happens in all app phases, by 18%, 14% and 29% in phases 1a,
1b, and 1c, respectively. Hence, the energy diﬀerence within each phase mainly
comes from network energy, which is 41%, 56% and 68% higher under phases
1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively, over 5G than over LTE. Similarly, on the resolver
side, the major contribution to the higher energy drain over 5G compared to
over LTE also comes from all app phases, by 42%, 18% and 43% in phases 2a,
2b, and 2c, respectively. Again, the energy diﬀerence within each phase mainly
comes from network energy, which is 88%, 77%, and 77% higher under phases
2a, 2b, and 2c, respectively, over 5G than over LTE.
Power Comparison. Figure 10 shows a timeline of the instantaneous device
and network power consumption for one representative run over 5G mmWave

and LTE. In each timeline, we use diﬀerent colors to denote the diﬀerent app
phases.
Fig. 10. Power timeline.
We make the following observations: (1) The total instantaneous device power
consumption is higher during phase 1b on the host side over both 5G mmWave
and LTE and during phase 2b on the resolver side over 5G mmWave – the two
phases where we primarily have network activity (the device power over LTE
on the resolver side is largely constant over all four phases, due to low network
activity and the low power draw of the LTE NIC). (2) The network power draw is
non-zero in phases 1a, 1c, 2a, 2c, 2d, in spite of minimal network activity during
those phases due to the well-known tail power state in cellular networks. (3) The
network power draw ﬂuctuates largely over time, especially over 5G mmWave.
In contrast, the power for all other device components remains largely constant
over time. For example, for CPU, even though the average utilization in phase
1a (578%) is higher than in phase 1c (535%), the average power diﬀerence is
just 108 mW. This is because the app utilizes almost exclusively the LITTLE
cores, and the diﬀerence in utilization does not get translated to signiﬁcant power
diﬀerence. Hence, the ﬂuctuations of the network power contribute to the large
ﬂuctuations of the device power consumption observed in Fig. 10.
In summary, our detailed energy drain analysis shows that, as expected [26],
the app drains signiﬁcantly higher network energy under 5G compared to under
LTE. Since the network energy accounts for about 32% of the total energy, such
signiﬁcant network energy diﬀerence translates into smaller diﬀerence in the total
app energy drain, by 23% on the host and 43% on the resolver.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we studied whether 5G mmWave can support multi-user AR by
conducting an in-depth measurement study of a popular multi-user AR app
194

over both LTE and 5G mmWave. Our measurements showed that, in spite of
the much higher bandwidth and lower RTT, 5G mmWave results in only a small
reduction to the visual data transmission latency due to the small data burst
sizes, which do not allow TCP to exit slow start and take full advantage of the
higher bandwidth. A potential approach to addressing this issue is to leverage
TCP splitting [28], and maintain a persistent TCP connection with a very large
window between an edge server and the cloud, while the UE establishes a TCP
connection to the edge server. We also found that an optimization that was
proposed over LTE networks can also be eﬀective over 5G networks and can
further reduce the data transmission latency. However, other major contributors
to the E2E AR latency keep it in the order of several seconds, rendering user
interaction practically infeasible. Since some of these factors (e.g., cloud pro-
cessing) are independent of the underlying cellular network, one may have to
consider more drastic changes to the design of multi-user AR apps, e.g., mov-
ing the cloud services to the edge [34] – a rapidly increasing trend among both
content providers and cellular operators [11,39] – or shifting from a client-server
to a P2P paradigm [33]. Additionally, there is a need for cellular operators to
revisit the middlebox policies in their packet core networks, which can also have
an adverse impact on multi-user AR performance. Finally, our energy analysis
showed that the app drains 66% more network energy over 5G mmWave com-
pared to over LTE, which translates into 23% and 43% higher total energy on
the host and the resolver, respectively, showing that 5G mmWave networks are
not currently optimized to eﬃciently support this type of apps.
