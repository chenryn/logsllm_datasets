### T24 Carcinoma and Vero Cell Line: Effects of Different Concentrations

**Objective:**
To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of a separated plant fraction from *C. alata* flower on T24 carcinoma cells and Vero cell line (mammalian non-cancerous cells) at four different concentrations (10, 20, 40, and 80 µg/ml). The results were compared with Adriamycin (a standard drug used as a positive control) and Emodin (a plant standard).

**Results:**
- **T24 Carcinoma Cells:**
  - The separated plant fraction demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in the overall activity of T24 carcinoma cells.
  - The IC50 value for the separated plant fraction was 45.3 µg/ml, and the GI50 value was 18.8 µg/ml.
  - At the initial concentration of 10 µg/ml, the SRB cytotoxicity assay showed a reduction in T24 cell growth by less than 50%.
  - Phase contrast micrographs revealed a significant decrease in viable cell numbers after 24 hours of treatment.

- **Vero Cell Line:**
  - The separated plant fraction and the plant standard did not show any cytotoxic effect even at the highest concentration of 80 µg/ml.
  - In contrast, the standard anticancer drug, Adriamycin, exhibited pronounced cytotoxic effects even at the lowest concentration of 10 µg/ml.

**Conclusion:**
The study indicates that the separated fraction from *C. alata* flower has potential anticancer activity, particularly against urinary bladder carcinoma cell lines.

**Abstract:**
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with over 700,000 fatalities annually. Despite this, its diagnosis remains largely based on invasive tissue sampling, and there are still gaps in understanding its pathogenesis, which involves complex interactions between lifestyle, genetics, epigenetics, chronic inflammation (e.g., IBD), and microbiota.

**Methods:**
- Serum samples were analyzed from patients with active CRC (n = 18), CRC in remission (R-CRC, n = 17), and healthy controls matched for biases (HC, n = 19; R-HC, n = 17).
- An optimized and validated GC×GC-(HR)TOFMS method, including an in-house quality control system and data processing using multiple statistical techniques, was employed.
- The method uses full mass spectrum, linear retention indices, and accurate mass provided by high-resolution (HR) time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

**Results:**
- Due to the experimental design, direct comparison between active and remission samples was not possible. Therefore, effect size, which measures both statistical significance and magnitude of signal variation, was used.
- The study identified candidate biomarkers with potential for diagnosing the active state of CRC and for comparing molecular processes in the remission state.

**Conclusion:**
The use of effect size in metabolomics provides valuable insights into the biological processes underlying CRC. The highlighted candidate biomarkers show promise for discriminating between active and remission states of the disease.

**Abstract:**
GRP94 is an ATP-dependent chaperone involved in regulating pro-oncogenic signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown a critical role of GRP94 in brain metastasis pathogenesis and progression.

**Methods:**
- LC-MS and untargeted lipidomic analysis using ROIMCR methodology were performed on GRP94-deficient cell models.
- The results were compared to control cells to identify alterations in lipid species, particularly GM2 and GM3 gangliosides.

**Results:**
- GRP94-silenced cells showed lower levels of GM3 and higher levels of GM2, indicating a disruption in the catalytic pathway of GM2.
- A deficiency in the GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP), a cofactor of β-Hexosaminidase (HexA), was observed without changes in gene expression, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation.
- These findings suggest that GM2-AP may be a client of the GRP94 chaperone, leading to defective GM2 catabolic processing and lysosomal accumulation of GM2 in GRP94-ablated cells.

**Conclusion:**
The imbalance in gangliosides, particularly GM2 and GM3, and the regulation of GM2-AP by GRP94, play crucial roles in brain metastasis. GM2-AP is a promising target for diagnosis and therapy in brain metastasis research.

**Abstract:**
Thymus cancer, classified as thymoma or thymic carcinoma, is a rare but serious condition with increasing incidence with age. It often presents with autoimmune diseases, anemia, or antibody deficiencies. The molecular pathogenesis of thymic epithelial tumors is poorly understood, especially regarding metastasis and recurrence.

**Methods:**
- High-resolution (HR) magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used for metabolic profiling of 21 thymus tissue samples, including benign and malignant thymomas.
- Metabolite levels were correlated with clinicopathological parameters such as gender, age, histology, and Masaoka classification.

**Results:**
- This is the first study to perform non-targeted metabolic profiling on a cohort of thymus tissue samples using HR-MAS NMR.
- The metabolite profiles provide new insights into the molecular processes in thymic tumor tissue, which could improve prognosis and offer new treatment options.

**Conclusion:**
HR-MAS NMR-based metabolic profiling is a valuable tool for understanding the molecular characteristics of thymus cancer. The results can be combined with other "omics" data to discover molecular subgroups and develop targeted therapies.

- Metabolic profiles of plasma samples from cancer patients (gastric, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic cancer, etc.) were compared with those from healthy controls using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).

**Results:**
- Cancer patients showed distinct metabolic profiles compared to healthy controls.
- Significant changes were observed in the plasma concentrations of certain amino acids, biogenic amines, and glycerophospholipids.
- Tryptophan, histidine, and lysophosphatidylcholines were decreased, while glutamine was increased in cancer patients.

**Conclusion:**
Exhaustive profiling of plasma metabolites contributes to personalized medicine for cancer. The identified metabolites may be involved in cancer progression and could serve as potential biomarkers.

- The aim was to understand the heterogeneity of breast cancer and identify potential biomarkers.

**Results:**
- MSI allowed the visualization of the spatial distribution and intensity of metabolites and lipids in breast tissue.
- The study identified several altered metabolites and lipids, providing insights into the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer.

**Conclusion:**
Mass spectrometry imaging is a valuable tool for understanding the metabolic heterogeneity of breast cancer. The identified metabolites and lipids may serve as potential biomarkers for more accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment.

**Abstract:**
Prostate cancer tissue is highly heterogeneous, making molecular profiling challenging. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the identification of the spatial distribution of biological molecules on tissue sections.

**Methods:**
- Metabolic profiling of 45 prostate cancer tissue samples was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MSI in negative and positive ion modes at 30 µm resolution.
- Pairwise comparisons of spectra from different tissue types (benign epithelium, cancer epithelium, and stroma) were conducted using multivariate orthogonalized partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA).

**Results:**
- Antioxidant-related metabolites, such as taurine and oxidized glutathione, had higher levels in stroma compared to benign epithelium.
- Citrate and spermine levels were reduced in stroma and cancer epithelium compared to benign epithelium.
- Carnitine and acetylcarnitine, which are part of the carnitine shuttle, had higher levels in cancer epithelium compared to benign epithelium.

**Conclusion:**
MALDI-TOF MSI revealed alterations in key molecular processes, such as lipid β-oxidation, prostatic secretory function, and inflammation, in prostate tumor tissue. The spatial information provided by MSI highlights the importance of methodologies capable of detecting metabolite distributions in defined tissue structures.
