Colorectal Cancer : Biomarkers and Effect Size
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nicolas Di Giovanni, University of Liège, MS Lab, Obiachem Group, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Meuwis Marie-Alice, Louis Edouard, Focant Jean-François
Colorectal cancer kills more than 700000 persons each year worldwide Nevertheless, its diagnosis is still largely based on invasive tissue 
sampling and gaps remain in the understanding of its pathogenesis, with complex combinations between lifestyle, genetics, epigenetics, chronic 
inflammation (IBD) and microbiota We analyzed serum samples from patients affected by colorectal cancer (CRC, n = 18) and by colorectal cancer 
in remission (R-CRC, n = 17), and samples from healthy patients matched for biases (HC, n = 19 and R-HC, n = 17) The aim was to find candidate 
biomarkers able to diagnose the active state of the disease as well as to compare the concentration levels of the molecules of interest with the 
remission state to better understand the biolocal processes beneath the observed clinical and metabolic symptoms To do so, an optimized 
and validated (NIST SRM 1950) comprehensive GC×GC-(HR)TOFMS method we developed was used It includes an in-house QC system, data 
processing based on multiple statistical techniques and identification using full mass spectrum, linear retention indices and accurate mass provided 
by state-of-the-art high-resolution (HR) time-of-flight mass spectrometry Because the experimental design prevented a direct comparison between 
the active and remission samples, which were not directly matched for biases, we used a measure called effect size that has the advantage to not 
only focus on statistical significance but on effect (here signal variation) magnitude We will discuss the interest and application of effect size in 
metabolomics and we will present the highlighted candidate biomarkers in terms of discrimination potential

An untargeted lipidomic analysis reveals ganglioside GM2/GM3 balance and the regulation of GM2-AP cofactor  
through GRP94 chaperone as important new key players in brain metastasis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Carmen Bedia, Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research (IDAEA-CSIC), Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Míriam Badia, Laia Muixí, Thierry Levade, Romà Tauler, Angels Sierra
GRP94 is an ATP-dependent chaperone able to regulate pro-oncogenic signaling pathways Previous studies have shown a critical role of GRP94 
in brain metastasis pathogenesis and progression In this work, we explored if GRP94 regulates lipid metabolism in GRP94-deficient cell models 
through LC-MS and an untargeted lipidomic analysis using the ROIMCR methodology The results showed that some lipid species were altered in 
GRP94-deficient cells, specially GM2 and GM3 gangliosides GRP94-silenced cells contain lower levels of GM3 and higher levels of GM2 compared 
to control cells, indicating that the catalytic pathway of GM2 was affected by the low enzymatic activity of β-Hexosaminidase (HexA), responsible for 
the hydrolysis of GM2 to GM3 Moreover, a deficiency of the GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP), the cofactor of HexA, is observed without any gene 
expression change, indicating a post-transcriptional alteration of GM2-AP in the GRP94-ablated cells These results suggest that GM2-AP may be 
a client of GRP94 chaperone, resulting in defective GM2 catabolic processing and lysosomal accumulation of GM2 in GRP94-ablated cells Overall, 
given the role of gangliosides in cell surface dynamics and signaling, their imbalance might be linked to modifications of cell behaviour acquired in 
brain metastasis progression On the other hand, this work indicates that GM2-AP is a key factor in the maintenance of ganglioside balance in cell 
membranes, which is regulated by GRP94 expression These findings highlight the relevance of GM3 and GM2 gangliosides in BrM and reveal GM2-
AP as a promising diagnosis and therapeutic target in BrM research

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mikheil Gogiashvili, Leibniz Institut für Analytische Wissenschaften - ISAS - e.V., Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Mohammad Al Wahsh, Jörg Lambert, Roland Hergenröder, Djeda Belharrazem, Alexander Marx
The thymus is an important lymphoid organ that is directly linked to the immune system Thymus cancer, classified either as thymoma or thymic 
carcinoma, shows an increasing incidence with age and is so far lacking any curative options except surgery It is often accompanied by autoimmune 
diseases, anemia or a lack of antibodies The molecular pathogenesis of thymic epithelial tumors is hardly understood especially with respect to 
metastasis formation and tumor recurrence A more thorough understanding of the molecular processes in thymic tumor tissue would improve the 
prognosis and would offer new treatment options for thymus cancer High resolution (HR) magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) based metabolic profiling is increasingly being used in cancer tissue analysis, for instance to assess the correlation of the metabolic profile 
with prognostic factors and with clinically relevant endpoints such as survival outcome and therapy response Since HR MAS measurements are 
non-destructive, metabolomics studies can be easily combined with further investigations like subsequent histological or other “omics” related 
analysis, for example to discover molecular subgroups of diseases by combining quantitative metabolic and transcriptomic data Thymomas and 
thymic carcinomas are rare tumors (occurrence approx 1-2 in 500 000) In this study, we for the first time performed non-targeted metabolic 
profiling on a very valuable cohort of 21 tissue samples of thymus tissue as well as benign and malignant thymomas by means of HR-MAS NMR The 
metabolite levels are correlated with clinicopathological parameters like gender, age, histology and Masaoka classification

Altered cell metabolism, a characteristic feature for many kinds of cancers, results in changes to intracellular and extracellular metabolite 
concentrations Although many kinds of metabolites were reported as biomarkers, cancer-related change of metabolism is still not well 
understood In order to diagnose and treat cancer patients comprehensively and effectively, it is important to identify specific biomarkers by 
reliable quantification of metabolites Our aim is to identify the changes of metabolic profiles in plasma of individuals with cancer in comparison 
with healthy controls by quantification of many kinds of metabolites As a first step, plasma concentrations of metabolites including amino acids, 
biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and hexoses were quantified using LC-MS/MS and FIA-MS/MS (AbsoluteIDQ 
p180 kit) We compared metabolic profiles of plasma samples from cancer patients (gastric, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic cancer, etc) with those 
from healthy controls As a result of principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), 
cancer patients showed different metabolic profiles compared to healthy controls Plasma concentrations of some amino acids, biogenic amines, 
and glycerophospholipids were significantly changed in the case of cancer plasma Especially, tryptophan, histidine, and lysophosphatidylcholines 
were decreased, while glutamine was increased These metabolites may be involved in the progression of cancer Our data suggest that exhaustive 
profiling of plasma metabolites contributes to personalized medicine for cancer

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer in women worldwide, and it is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease with distinct 
molecular features The gold standard for clinical diagnosis of breast cancer is through histopathology and the presence or absence of certain 
marker proteins These methods do, however, not fully capture the biological heterogeneity of the disease Mass spectrometry imaging is a powerful 
tool that allows us to produce metabolic images of clinical tissues with their corresponding distribution and intensity For this study, 12 breast needle 
biopsies were analyzed and compared using multivariate analysis, towards the profiling of altered metabolites and lipids between different tissue 
types, to understand the heterogeneity of breast cancer

Multiplatform metabolomics for the biomarker discovery in pancreatic cancer
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Raquel Cumeras, Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV), Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Raquel Cumeras, Esther Molina-Montes, Alfredo Carrato, Xavier Molero, Francisco X. Real, Núria Malats, Xavier Correig
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or pancreatic cancer, is the deadliest cancer worldwide, despite its relatively low population incidence, 
and early-stages biomarkers are needed Samples were selected from a large case-control study (4000-subjects) on pancreatic cancer (PanGenEU) 
conducted in 28-centres from 6-European countries In this study, metabolomics profiles of 60 PDAC cases and 60 controls from 2-centres in 
Spain, were evaluated using non-targeted metabolomics with UHPLC-QTOF-MS, GC-QTOF-MS for serum samples (polar and non-polar phases), 
and 1H-NMR for urine and fecal samples LC-MS peak peaking, alignment and retention drift correction was done with XCMS, then QC-normalized 
with PQN Samples from both centers were analyzed together, randomizing their order in the experimental analysis, so the relevant metabolites 
identified (FDR350 metabolites to be associated with the intervention including branched chain amino acids (eg 
alpha-hydroxyisovalerate), carbohydrates (eg mannose) and lipids, such as sphingomyelins Integration of our results into a metabolite-disease 
interaction network indicate potential relevance for cancer and neurological phenotypes Whilst many of the changes we see are likely due to the 
intervention effect on weight which was estimated to be -88kg (95% CI: -103, -73), there is also some indication that the metabolite profile reflects 
dietary and lifestyle changes These experimental study data on diabetes remission augment the understanding gained from observational studies 
of diabetes development

Targeted Multi-OMICS: Rapid plasma profiling of a bladder and lung cancer human cohort
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Billy Molloy, Waters Corporation, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Sarah Lennon, Lee Gethings, Robert Plumb
Cancer is a complex, life threatening disease, existing in many forms Here, we present a study comparing plasma samples from cohorts of bladder 
and lung cancer patients, with healthy controls using a high-throughput targeted OMICS workflow This workflow allows for rapid screening of 
various compound classes using a single LC-MS platform A known level of a labelled analogue from each compound class was added to each 
sample The level of each analyte was then estimated using its ratio to this Data was collected for 18 samples (6 controls; 6 bladder cancer; 6 
lung cancers) QC’s (a pool from all samples) were acquired every ninth injection In total, 206 injections were performed (runtime = 22hr) 128 
compounds were measured, generating a %CV <20% for the QC samples: 80 proteins, 20 acylcarnitines and 28 amino acids Valine-d8 (amino 
acid spiked in samples) is used as an example to illustrate the consistency of response across the whole study (CV= <5%) Pair-wise comparisons 
using a t-test were performed on each compound class The amino acid sarcosine was demonstrated to be up-regulated in both lung and bladder 
cancer samples; the acyl carnitine Octenoyl-carnitine (C8:1) was down-regulated in bladder cancer subjects; and protein analysis highlighted various 
differentiating species, including Apolipoproteins This data demonstrates the ability of this targeted approach to highlight potential markers in a 
high-throughput manner Method development was unnecessary, and results were obtained in <24 hours The next step would be to validate the 
markers by performing a more statistically rigorous study

The metabolic processes of a cancer cell in comparison with a normal cell are strongly deregulated, and could be associated with increased 
energetic and adaptive needs required for proliferation, progression and metastasis in challenging microenvironment Therefore, altered cancer 
metabolism become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention For instance, glutaminase inhibitors, same as fatty acid synthesis inhibitors, 
have shown efficacy in preclinical testing and entered already clinical trials However, given the complexity of metabolic interactions it could be 
hypothesized that inhibition of one metabolic pathway might trigger series of metabolic adaptations towards cancer cell survival and as a result 
end up with a treatment failure Here, we are proposing to monitor metabolic landscape of cancer cell at its baseline as well as under treatment to 
provide further insight into cancer metabolic plasticity, which might lead to prediction of rational intervention in the cancer metabolism and thus 
treatment optimization We have determined metabolic baseline of 6 normal and 30 cancer cell lines from lung and breast using non-targeted 
metabolic profiling We identified 380 metabolites out of which 130 molecules, from various metabolic classes, showed significant deregulations 
across the cancer cell lines in comparison to normal cells We further draw a map of cancer cell metabolism and determined key metabolic 
deregulations Here, we report on metabolic plasticity under glutaminolysis inhibition and characterize strategies for treatment optimization driven 
by metabolic analysis With this study we are proposing approach for optimization of cancer treatment strategies based on metabolic responses, 
which we call Rational Metabolic Engineering

Concentrations of D- and L- 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) were determined in tumor tissue samples of glioma patients WHO grade I – III (astrocytoma, 
oligodendroglioma, secondary glioblastoma) with possibility of genetic mutation on isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 in vitro The 
concentrations were determined (quantified) by HPLC-HRMS technique using Agilent HPLC and Bruker Q-TOF HRMS spectrometer setup The D-2-
HG concentration was double checked by D-2-Hydroxyglutarate Colorimetric Assay Kit Concurrently the genetic mutation analyses of both IDH 1 
and 2 were performed by isolation of cancer tissue DNA, PCR amplification and subsequent Sanger sequencing This was to confirm the correlation 
of 2-HG in vitro concentrations in tumor tissue and the results from mutation analyses Also the in vitro HPLC-HRMS data were correlated with 
immunohistological findings

BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is a major public health concern worldwide, remaining the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality 
Colorectal cancer has a natural history of evolution from normal mucosa to adenoma to cancer, thereby providing a window of opportunity for 
effective intervention and prevention Thus, the discovery of biomarkers that aid in the characterization of risk of progression along the colorectal 
carcinogenesis are urgently needed to tailor prevention strategies METHODS Targeted metabolomics analysis was performed on plasma samples 
from 831 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients, 600 adenoma patients, and 753 controls, using mass spectrometry and the Biocrates 
AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit Samples included in this study were derived from five colorectal cancer cohorts embedded in the European MetaboCCC 
consortium We applied a comprehensive data analysis strategy to investigate signals of changes in the metabolomic profile that vary along the 
continuum of colorectal carcinogenesis RESULTS Data on 131 metabolites were applicable for further analysis in all study samples We established 
a categorical regression model to identify metabolites associated with the development of colorectal cancer Metabolites significantly associated 
with colorectal carcinogenesis were further used to establish a random effects model able to predict colorectal cancer patients, adenoma cases and 
controls CONCLUSION The complementary study population, brought together as part of the MetaboCCC consortium, provided a unique resource 
for comprehensive investigations enabling a distinction of malignancy potential Our findings suggest that metabolites associated with the risk for 
colorectal carcinogenesis can be used in future for risk stratification, eg, for tailored screening strategies by endoscopy

Molecular profiling of prostate cancer tissue is challenging due to the heterogeneous tissue composition Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables 
identification of spatial distribution of biological molecules on tissue sections In this study, we performed metabolic profiling of 45 prostate cancer 
tissue samples using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MSI (negative and positive ion mode, 30 µm resolution) 
By pairwise comparing spectra from different tissue types (benign epithelium (BE), cancer epithelium and stroma) with multivariate orthogonlized 
partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) modeling, we identified several differences in metabolism The antioxidant-related 
metabolites taurine and oxidized glutathione had higher levels in stroma compared to benign epithelium Citrate and spermine had reduced levels 
in stroma and in cancer epithelium compared to BE, which confirms previous findings Lastly, carnitine and acetylcarnitine, which are parts of the 
carnitine shuttle, had higher levels in cancer epithelium compared to BE, while no differences were observed between stroma and BE The carnitine 
shuttle is important for the regulation of β-oxidation of lipids vs lipid synthesis balance Mass identity of the metabolites was verified through MS/
MS In conclusion, we identified alterations in key molecular processes, such as lipid β-oxidation, prostatic secretory function and inflammation, in 
prostate tumor tissue using MALDI-TOF MSI The significant differences in metabolite distributions between the defined tissue structures, pinpoint 
the importance of access to methodology capable of providing spatial information

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Szymon Macioszek, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland
CO-AUTHORS: Urszula Kijanko, Michał Jan Markuszewski
Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is a rare type of cancer that affects around 15 people per million in Europe Most often GIST develops as a 
consequence of mutations in KIT gene or PDGFRA gene, less frequently However, metabolic patterns during GIST development have not yet been
