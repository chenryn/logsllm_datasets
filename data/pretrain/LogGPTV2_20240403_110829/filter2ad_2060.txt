Abstract: In existing multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) MAC
protocols, a multi-antenna node sends as many concurrent
streams as possible once it wins the contention. Though
such a scheme allows nodes to utilize the multiplex gain of a
MIMO system, it however fails to leverage receive diversity
gains provided by multiple receive antennas across nodes.
We introduce Multiplex-Diversity Medium Access (MDMA),
a MU-MIMO MAC protocol that achieves both the multi-
plex gain and the receive diversity gain at the same time.
Instead of letting a node pair use all the available degrees of
freedom, MDMA allows as many contending node pairs to
communicate concurrently as possible and share all the de-
grees of freedom. It hence can exploit the antennas equipped
on diﬀerent receivers to further provide some of concurrent
streams more receive diversity, without losing the achiev-
able multiplex gain. We implement a prototype on software
radios to demonstrate the throughput gain of MDMA.

INTRODUCTION
The key idea behind our design is to enable multiple node
pairs communicating concurrently to achieve more receive
diversity on some streams. To illustrate why sharing all the
degrees of freedom across node pairs can gain more receive
diversity, let us consider an example shown in Fig. 1(a),
where two 2-antenna nodes contend for transmission. In ex-
isting MU-MIMO MAC protocols. e.g., [1], tx1 delivers two
streams once it wins the contention, while tx2 abstains from
transmission. In this case, tx1 occupies the whole medium,
and each stream tx1 transmits only has receive diversity of
1. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1(b), if we make tx1 transmit
one stream and tx2 transmit the second stream by using in-
terference alignment, the stream from tx1 can obtain receive
diversity of 2! This is because, when tx2 aligns its signal at
rx1 along the direction orthogonal to tx1’s signal, as shown
in the bottom graph (below rx1) in Fig. 1(b), rx1 can decode

the stream from tx1 using maximal ratio combining (MRC)
as if the stream from tx2 does not exist.
Speciﬁcally, let hij be the channel from the ith transmit
antenna to the jth receive antenna as shown in Fig. 1(b). If
tx1 transmits x1 alone from any of its antennas, say antenna
1, the two antennas at rx1 can receive the following signals
y1 = h11x1 + n1
y2 = h12x1 + n2
, where n1 and n2 are the noise observed at rx1’s two anten-
nas. To achieve the receive diversity gain, rx1 can recover
the symbol x1 by using the MRC technique as follows.
ˆx1 =
h∗
11y1 + h∗
|h11|2
12y2
+ |h12|2
(1)
Since the recovered signal ˆx1 is the weighted sum of two sig-
nals traversing two diverse paths, MRC can hence improve
the SNR of the recovered signal.
Now lets assume that tx2 uses one of its antennas, e.g., an-
tenna 3, to transmit concurrently without interference align-
ment. The received signals at rx1’s two antennas become
y1 = h11x1 + h31x2 + n1
y2 = h12x1 + h32x2 + n2.
In this case, rx1 cannot use MRC in Eq. (1) to decode x1
because tx2 creates interference at rx1. However, if tx2 per-
forms interference alignment by transmitting the precoded
symbols αx2 and βx2 from its two antennas, rx1 can now
receive the following signals.
y1 = h11x1 + (αh31 + βh41) x2 + n1
y2 = h12x1 + (αh32 + βh42) x2 + n2.
To ensure rx1 to be able to use MRC to achieve the same
SNR after tx2 joins concurrent transmission, we let tx2 align
its signal x2 at rx1 along the direction orthogonal to x1,
i.e., (−h∗
11). That is, tx2 should ensure the precoding

By performing the above interference alignment technique,
tx2 can ensure not to interfere rx1 because rx1 can still
use MRC in Eq.
(1) to completely remove the interfer-
ence from tx2. Note that rx2 in Fig. 1(b) can use the stan-
dard MIMO decoder, e.g., zero-forcing, to decode the second
stream x2. Therefore, this example shows that MDMA not
only achieves the same multiplex gain, but also provides rx1
the receive diversity gain.
Numerical Analysis: We mathematically derive the SNR
gain of the case shown in Fig. 1(b) over that in Fig. 1(a). Let
P be the power constraint of both transmitters. In addition,
we assume that ni is white Gaussian noise with variance N0.
The received signals in Fig. 1(a) can be formulated as

P/2[h11x1 + h21x2] + n1

following SNR.

P [h13x1 + (αh33 + βh43) x2] +n 3
P [h14x1 + (αh34 + βh44) x2] +n 4
rx1 and rx2 use MRC and zero-forcing to decode x1 and x2,
respectively, and achieve the following SNR.
SN Rb(x1) =
SN Rb(x2) =

, which is always greater than 2. To derive the SNR gain
of x2, we assume that hij are i.i.d. complex Gaussian vari-
ables with zero mean and unit variance. Because of the
unitary property of the precoding vector (α, β), αh33 + βh43
and αh34 + βh44 are also i.i.d. complex Gaussian variables
with zero mean and unit variance. We can observe now
that SN Rb(x2) and 2SN Ra(x2) follow the same distribu-
tion. Thus, on average, SN Rb(x2) has a gain of 2.
2. PROTOCOL DESIGN
The goal of MDMA is to allow more node pairs to engage
in concurrent transmission and achieve more receive diver-
sity. Unlike existing protocols that allow each contention
winner to send as many concurrent streams as possible [1],
MDMA involves as many node pairs in concurrent transmis-
sion as possible. To achieve the receive diversity gain, we let

multiple transmitters join concurrent transmission one after
another, and use interference alignment to avoid aﬀecting
receive diversity of the ongoing transmissions. Consider a
more general example shown in Fig. 2, where three trans-
mitters contend for the medium. Unlike [1] that allows tx1
to transmit two streams and tx2 to transmit one stream,
MDMA lets each of three transmitters send one stream, one
after another. To provide rx1 and rx2 diversity gains, tx2
and tx3 align their signals orthogonal to the ﬁrst stream at
rx1, while tx3 further aligns its signal orthogonal to the pro-
jection of the second stream onto the subspace interference-
free to the ﬁrst stream at rx2. The main challenge of our
design is how to allocate concurrent transmission opportuni-
ties and perform alignment across node pairs in a distributed
way. To address these issues, we modify frequency-domain
contention [2] to operate in a MU-MIMO WLAN. Due to
space limit, we leave the details in our future work.
3. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
We implement the scenario in Fig. 1 using USRP-N200
software radios, each of which is equipped with a RFX2400
daughterboard and communicates on a 10 MHz channel in
the 2.4 GHz range. We repeat the experiment in randomly-
selected locations in our testbed. Fig. 3 plots the CDFs of
the total throughput of both scenarios in Fig. 1. It shows
that MDMA leverages both the diversity and power gains,
and hence outperforms the single-pair MIMO scenario.
4. CONCLUSION
We propose MDMA, which enables as many node pairs to
involve in concurrent transmission as possible in order to uti-
lize receive diversity gains and power gains. We analytically
derive the theoretical SNR gain and empirically demonstrate
the throughput gain of a toy example in MDMA. While more
work needs to be done, we believe that MDMA can be gen-
eralized to any scenarios and better utilize MIMO capability
than the examples explored in this work.
