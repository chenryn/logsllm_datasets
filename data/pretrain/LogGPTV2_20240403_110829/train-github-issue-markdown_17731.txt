The same changes suggested in issue #13480 should be applied to popovers.
* * *
Adding a bit of info to the item with `aria-describedby` to the popover would
help signal to Assistive Technology, like screen readers, that element getting
targeted by the tooltip that it is better described by this other DOM thing.
This is illustrated on paypal/bootstrap-accessibility-plugin source line 52
### Changes that would need to happen:
  * Create an unique ID / or use for the target element on show
  * Add an `aria-describedby="elementId"` on the element on show
We already have `role="tooltip"` üëç
