User: I'm writing Python code using Vim inside Terminal (typing command "vim" to start up Vim).  I've been trying to find a way to execute the code through the mac terminal in the same window.
I'm trying to use :!python % but I get the following error message:
E499: Empty file name for '%' or '#', only works with ":p:h"
Anyone have any suggestions?
Assistant: You can't execute a file if that file doesn't exist.
Write the file with :w filename.py (further writes only need :w) and execute your script with :!python %.
Learning programming and Vim at the same time is not a very good idea: Vim is a complex beast and trying to handle both learning curves won't be easy. As much as I love Vim, I'd suggest you use another text editor, at least in the beginning, like Sublime Text or TextMate.
In short, focus on programming first by using a simple and intuitive editor and learn Vim once you are comfortable enough in your craft.
Or don't, Vim is the greatest text editor but you can definitely be a successful programmer without it.
