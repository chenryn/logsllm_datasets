User: I have a python script that runs as a daemon process. I want to be able to stop and start the process via a web page. I made a PHP script that runs exec() on the python daemon. Any idea?

Assistant: Make sure whatever user php is running under has appropriate permissions. You can try opening a pipe and changing users, or just use apache's suexec.
