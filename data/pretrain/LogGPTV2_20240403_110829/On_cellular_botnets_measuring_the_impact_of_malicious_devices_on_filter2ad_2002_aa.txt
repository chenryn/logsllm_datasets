ABSTRACT
The vast expansion of interconnectivity with the Internet and the
rapid evolution of highly-capable but largely insecure mobile de-
vices threatens cellular networks. In this paper, we characterize the
impact of the large scale compromise and coordination of mobile
phones in attacks against the core of these networks. Through a
combination of measurement, simulation and analysis, we demon-
strate the ability of a botnet composed of as few as 11,750 compro-
mised mobile phones to degrade service to area-code sized regions
by 93%. As such attacks are accomplished through the execution of
network service requests and not a constant stream of phone calls,
users are unlikely to be aware of their occurrence. We then inves-
tigate a number of signiﬁcant network bottlenecks, their impact on
the density of compromised nodes per base station and how they
can be avoided. We conclude by discussing a number of counter-
measures that may help to partially mitigate the threats posed by
such attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Attacks against the core infrastructure of the Internet have be-
come commonplace. Services including DNS [18, 45, 12] and
BGP [8, 41, 33, 46] are now regularly targeted by highly capable

adversaries. While malicious behavior has caused signiﬁcant prob-
lems for speciﬁc services and sets of domains, such attacks have
not yet resulted in an Internet-wide collapse. Systems with more
rigid hierarchical dependencies, notably cellular networks, are less
likely to withstand similar maliciousness. While attacks on these
networks are beginning to become more diverse, academic research
in this area has only focused on two general thrusts. The ﬁrst ex-
plores how the lack of authentication for signaling trafﬁc in the
wired network would allow an adversary with physical access to
cause signiﬁcant outages [35, 26, 13, 32]. The second investigates
attacks targeting the wireless portion of the network, and results
in either the saturation of a wireless link [60, 59, 43, 58] or the
conversion of a mobile phone into spam generators or nodes used
to attack Internet-based resources [22, 19, 39]. However, previous
studies have not investigated whether compromised mobile phones
can generate sufﬁcient amounts of trafﬁc to impair the network core
itself, yet alone attempted to measure the damage caused by such
trafﬁc.
In this paper, we evaluate the potential for and impact of the
large scale infection and coordination of mobile phones in attacks
against the core of a cellular network. In particular, we character-
ize Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using selected service request
types on the Home Location Register (HLR), the central reposi-
tory of user location and proﬁle information in the network, by a
botnet composed entirely of mobile phones. As the HLR must be
queried in the delivery of all phone calls and text messages, acts
as the authentication service for the network, records data for the
purposes of billing and assists in wide range of other jobs, such an
attack would potentially devastate nearly all service in the network.
Our results show that botnets as small as 11,750 phones can cause
a reduction of throughput of more than 90% to area-code sized re-
gions supported by most currently deployed systems. More capable
databases experience a throughput reduction of approximately 75%
when faced with attacks by 141,000 compromised devices. Note
that while such numbers may appear large, they typically represent
less than 2% and 15% of phones assigned to a single HLR, respec-
tively. We then explore the bottlenecks that make the realization of
these attacks difﬁcult and how they can be overcome.
While such attacks may seem similar to other attacks on core
infrastructure, noteworthy differences in the architecture of cellu-
lar networks make the consequences of such behavior signiﬁcantly
worse. Whereas widespread caching and the existence of multiple
routes would help mitigate the loss of a DNS root or BGP node,
respectively, the loss of an HLR would make all users assigned to
this device immediately unreachable.
223In this work, we make the following contributions:
• Attack Characterization and Quantiﬁcation: We use a
combination of an industry standard benchmarking tool and
testing on a live network to characterize a ﬂooding attack on
an HLR. Such testing allows us to not only determine if com-
promised phones can generate a sufﬁcient amount of trafﬁc
to cause large-scale outages, but also provides the ﬁrst esti-
mates of the necessary size of cellular botnets. To our knowl-
edge, this work represents the ﬁrst investigation of such at-
tacks on the core of a cellular network.
• Reduce Adversary’s Workload: Through the above tests,
we are able to determine the classes of operations that force
the network to do the most work, thereby reducing the effort
required by an adversary seeking to cause outages.
• Provide Intelligent Control Mechanisms: We discuss a
number of different command and control structures that will
help coordinate distributed attacks and provide a means of
avoiding network bottlenecks. We show that without careful
planning, these attacks are likely to fail.
Most critically, this work demonstrates that access to once unad-
dressable components in the core creates the potential for increas-
ingly sophisticated attacks against these networks. In this particular
case, we show that the reliance upon state information used to sup-
port mobility and a variety of network services makes these systems
highly susceptible to attack.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
provides an overview of related research; Section 3 presents the ar-
chitecture of the SS7 network core and examines a number of meth-
ods by which the large scale compromise of mobile devices could
occur; Section 4 details the attack itself; Section 5 characterizes and
quantiﬁes the impact of different types of trafﬁc on the HLR; Sec-
tion 6 measures the performance of individual commands against a
live network and aligns our TM1 simulations with deployed stan-
dards; Section 7 simulates an attack on the HLR; Section 8 dis-
cusses issues of cellular botnet management including command
and control; Section 9 provides a number of short-term mitigation
techniques; Section 10 provides concluding remarks.
2. RELATED WORK
Denial of service attacks have been studied in a wide variety
of systems. Targets including DNS roots [18, 45], software ven-
dors [24, 27], news services [47], search engines [44] and online
casinos [7] have all been overwhelmed by malicious trafﬁc. Such
attacks have even impacted resources and processes in the physi-
cal world, and caused signiﬁcant outages in areas such as banking,
emergency and even postal services [38, 10]. The research commu-
nity has responded with signiﬁcant attempts to both categorize [37]
and mitigate [49, 28, 29, 62, 63, 56, 55, 30, 64] such problems.
Unfortunately, such attacks are only beginning to be understood in
the context of cellular networks.
Previous research on the malicious overload of cellular networks
focused entirely on the wireless domain. The ﬁrst such work, by
Traynor et al [59], demonstrated that a small volume of text mes-
sages targeted at a geographic area could be used to deny legitimate
voice and SMS service. Serror et al. [50] showed that similar results
were possible by overloading paging services, as did Lee et al. [34]
on shared uplink channels. Racic et al. [43] investigated problems
with resource allocation algorithms on the air interface. While it
is possible to mitigate the impact of such attacks using a variety of
queue and resource management techniques [58], Traynor et al [60]
noted that it was the architecture of the network itself that was re-
sponsible for enabling such attacks. By attacking high-bandwidth
cellular data services with less trafﬁc than in their previous work,
this work illustrated the fundamental tension caused by the meeting
of best effort IP networks and the circuit-switched air interface of
cellular networks. However, such attacks were previously consid-
ered to have originated from outside of the targeted network.
The transformation of mobile devices from simple voice ter-
minals into highly-capable, general purpose computing platforms
makes the possibility of attacks originating from within the net-
work a reality. Mudge and Kingpin were among the ﬁrst to discuss
the insecurity of such devices in early handheld devices [31]. In
their examination of PalmOS, this work encountered a lack of even
the most basic operating system security mechanisms. Since that
time, a number of others have further investigated a variety of vul-
nerable device interfaces including Bluetooth [61, 9] and the mul-
timedia messaging subsystem (MMS) [39]. Guo et al. [22] argued
more generally that connecting such unprotected “smart” devices
to telecommunications may prove troublesome, but discussed only
attacks equivalent to local wireless jamming, denial of service on
call centers (e.g., endpoints) and spamming. While malware target-
ing such devices has surfaced, including Cabir [14], Mabir [15] and
Skulls [16], widespread infection like that seen on the Internet has
yet to be reported. Given that such devices continue to lack sufﬁ-
cient protection mechanisms, their ability to impact larger network
functionality must be investigated.
3. OVERVIEW OF CELLULAR SYSTEMS
In this section, we provide an overview of important background
information, including the architecture of cellular networks, the
hardware of mobile phones and a discussion of how such devices
are likely to become infected.
3.1 Network Architecture and Components
The heart of a cellular network is the Home Location Register
(HLR). Users are assigned to speciﬁc HLRs based on their phone
numbers. When someone attempts to call a user, the caller’s switch
queries the appropriate HLR with a request for the targeted user’s
current location. A variety of other services, ranging from authen-
tication and call-forwarding to billing rely on assistance from the
HLR. Accordingly, this central repository of user proﬁle data is
crucial in providing service in a network with mobile endpoints.
Mobile Switching Centers (MSCs) act as telephony switches and
deliver circuit-switched trafﬁc in a GSM network. Such a suc-
cinct description, however, fails to capture the magnitude of func-
tions tasked to these devices. MSCs are responsible for performing
“handoffs” between base stations, assist in billing operations and
can function as gateways to both wired and neighboring cellular
systems. With the assistance of a Visiting Location Register (VLR),
MSCs can identify and store information about currently associated
subscribers. However, requests for other subscribers still require in-
teraction with the HLR. For data connections, these operations are
performed by the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).
Mobile phones and other cellular-enabled devices connect wire-
lessly to the network through the Base Station Subsystem (BSS).
These units provide the logic for operations such as wireless re-
source management, encryption and frequency hopping.
3.2 Mobile Phone Architecture
Mobile phones operate using two processors. The Application
Processor supports functionality including traditional operating sys-
tem duties (e.g., memory management) and user services such as
the camera and music players. When a process needs to use the

network, the Application Processor passes an Attention, or AT com-
mand [51], to the Baseband Processor. Such commands can be
used to establish telephony and data links or invoke network sup-
ported services such as call waiting and registration.
AT commands can be passed to the Baseband Processor in a
number of other ways. Bluetooth connections, serial links and even
other applications with the necessary privileges can all inject such
requests. Malware infecting such devices can therefore easily initi-
ate interaction with the network core.
3.3 Infecting Phones
Mobile devices have rapidly transformed from limited embedded
systems to highly capable general purpose computing platforms.
While such devices have long enjoyed signiﬁcant diversity in hard-
ware and operating systems, the rising popularity of smartphones
and the ability to sell applications to users is leading to the estab-
lishment of standardized mobile software platforms and operating
systems, such as Microsoft’s Windows Mobile, Google’s Android
