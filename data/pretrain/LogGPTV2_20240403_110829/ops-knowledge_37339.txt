### Capacity Planning Model Design

To effectively predict the resource requirements for cloud servers over the next 24 months, including CPU, memory, and storage, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather historical data on CPU, memory, and storage usage from the past 24 months.
   - Organize the data by month to identify trends and patterns.

2. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Develop a time series model using the collected historical data.
   - Use statistical methods such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or machine learning techniques like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to forecast future resource demands.

3. **Business Growth Consideration**:
   - Adjust the forecast to account for the current rate of business growth.
   - Incorporate any planned business expansions or new projects that may impact resource needs.

4. **Hardware Upgrades**:
   - Factor in potential hardware upgrades when making predictions.
   - Consider the timing and impact of these upgrades on the overall resource requirements.

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Conduct performance tests on the predicted resource requirements to validate the accuracy and feasibility of the forecasts.
   - Ensure that the model can handle peak loads and unexpected surges in demand.

### Capacity Planning Report

#### Summary
Based on our capacity planning model, the demand for cloud server resources is expected to show an upward trend over the next 24 months. We recommend timely hardware upgrades and the addition of new servers to meet the growing business needs. The specific recommendations are detailed below:

#### CPU
- **Forecast**: Due to the rapid growth of business, we predict that the CPU demand will increase by 20%-25% over the next 22 months.
- **Recommendation**: Increase the number of CPU cores around the 12th month to achieve higher performance. This will help in handling increased workloads and ensuring smooth operations.

#### Memory
- **Forecast**: According to historical data and business growth projections, the memory requirements are expected to increase by 15%-20% over the next 24 months.
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade the memory around the 18th month to support higher business loads. This will enhance the server's ability to handle more complex tasks and larger datasets.

#### Storage
- **Forecast**: We predict that storage demand will grow steadily by 10%-15% over the next 24 months.
- **Recommendation**: Optimize storage data to save space and reduce costs. Additionally, plan for incremental storage upgrades to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet the growing needs.

#### Overall Recommendations
- **Hardware Upgrades**: Plan and execute hardware upgrades at strategic intervals (e.g., 12th and 18th months) to align with the forecasted increases in resource demand.
- **Server Scalability**: Increase the number of servers as needed to accommodate business growth and ensure that the infrastructure can handle peak loads without performance degradation.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring and periodic reviews of the capacity planning model to make adjustments as necessary based on real-time data and changing business conditions.

By following these recommendations, the company can proactively manage its cloud server resources, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency while supporting business growth.
