User:  A company is preparing for capacity planning and needs to predict the resource requirements of cloud servers in the next 24 months, including CPU, memory, and storage. Please design a capacity planning model and give a capacity planning report.
Assistant: Design of capacity planning model: 1. Collect historical data: collect CPU, memory, storage and other data of cloud servers in the past 24 months, and record them by month. 2. Build a time series model: Based on the collected historical data, build a time series model to predict the next 24 months. 3. Account for business growth: The forecast is revised to take into account the current rate of business growth. 4. Consider hardware upgrades: When forecasting, consider hardware upgrades and predict future server hardware upgrades. 5. Performance test: perform performance test on the prediction results to check the accuracy and feasibility of the prediction results. Capacity Planning Report: According to our capacity planning model, the demand for cloud servers will show an upward trend in the next 24 months. We recommend that companies upgrade hardware in a timely manner and increase the number of servers when needed to meet the growth of business needs. The specific plan is as follows: CPU: Due to the rapid growth of business, we predict that the CPU demand of servers will increase by 20%-25% in the next 24 months. Considering the hardware upgrade, we recommend increasing the number of CPU cores around the 12th month to achieve higher performance. Memory: According to historical data and business growth forecasts, the memory requirements of servers will increase by 15%-20% in the next 24 months. We recommend upgrading the memory around the 18th month to support higher business loads. Storage: We predict that storage demand for servers will grow steadily by 10%-15% over the next 24 months. At the same time, we recommend that companies optimize storage data to save storage space. To sum up, we recommend that the company upgrade the server hardware in the next 24 months, and increase the number of servers according to business needs to meet business development needs.
