## Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to bring billions of new connected devices online, placing significant strain on existing WiFi and cellular spectrum. Many IoT devices are low-power and use low-rate modulation schemes, leading to inefficient spectrum usage. Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology offers a potential solution by providing large chunks of high-frequency spectrum. However, current mmWave technology faces several challenges, including high power consumption, expensive hardware, and complex beam searching techniques. This paper introduces mmX, a novel mmWave network designed specifically for low-power, low-cost IoT devices. We address the key challenges that prevent existing mmWave technology from being suitable for such devices and present an empirical evaluation of our implementation.

## 1. Introduction
By 2025, it is estimated that 75 billion IoT devices will be installed, transforming various aspects of daily life, from smart homes and security cameras to smart cities and autonomous vehicles. While these prospects are exciting, they also pose significant challenges for wireless networks. Many IoT devices, such as sensors and cameras, require real-time data streaming, placing a growing strain on existing WiFi and cellular networks. These networks are already congested, and many IoT devices use omni-directional antennas, leading to inefficient spectrum usage.

Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands offer a promising solution by providing multi-GHz of unlicensed bandwidth, 200 times more than today's WiFi and cellular networks. Recent studies have explored mmWave technology for high-throughput applications like 5G, virtual reality, and data centers, which require multiple-gigabits-per-second throughput and substantial energy and computing power. However, these solutions are not suitable for low-power, low-cost IoT devices.

In this paper, we focus on using mmWave to enable a wireless network for low-cost, low-power IoT devices. This approach has two main advantages: it reduces the load on current WiFi spectrum and allows for efficient spatial reuse of the spectrum. However, there are several challenges to overcome:
- **High Power Consumption**: Existing mmWave radios consume too much power for low-power IoT devices.
- **Expensive Hardware**: Current mmWave components are costly, making them impractical for low-cost IoT devices.
- **Beam Searching**: Traditional beam searching techniques are complex and unsuitable for low-power, low-cost IoT devices.

We address these challenges and develop a mmWave network for low-cost, low-power IoT devices. Our network can be used in various applications, such as smart homes, public surveillance, and autonomous vehicles.

## 2. Background
Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology refers to very high-frequency RF signals, offering multi-GHz of unlicensed bandwidth. Unlike traditional wireless systems, mmWave frequencies suffer from high path loss, requiring directional antennas to focus the signal power in narrow beams. These directional antennas are implemented using phased arrays, which consist of multiple antennas with phase shifters. The high attenuation of mmWave signals necessitates beam searching to align the transmitter and receiver beams, making mmWave communication challenging.

## 3. Related Work
Related work can be classified into three areas:
- **mmWave Communication**: Recent studies have explored mmWave for high-throughput applications, but these solutions are not suitable for low-power, low-cost IoT devices.
- **Low-Power IoT Devices**: Research has focused on reducing power consumption and cost for IoT devices, but these efforts have not yet addressed the unique challenges of mmWave communication.
- **Beamforming and Directional Antennas**: Techniques for beamforming and directional antennas have been developed, but they are often complex and energy-intensive, making them unsuitable for low-power, low-cost IoT devices.

## 4. Contributions
This paper makes the following contributions:
- **Low-Cost, Low-Power mmWave Hardware Platform**: We design and build the first low-cost, low-power mmWave hardware platform, which operates as a daughterboard for Raspberry Pi. This platform can facilitate advanced mmWave research in the networking community.
- **New Communication Modulation Scheme**: We design a new communication modulation scheme that eliminates the need for beam searching in mmWave radios. This simplifies the hardware and reduces costs, making mmWave communication more accessible for IoT applications.
- **Empirical Evaluation**: We demonstrate the capability of our design in enabling a mmWave network for IoT applications. In a representative setup, mmX provides wireless links with SNR of 10dB or more at distances up to 18 meters. The maximum data rate of mmX nodes is 100 Mbps, and they consume only 1.1 W, resulting in an energy efficiency of 11 nj/bit, which is even lower than existing WiFi modules.

## 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we present mmX, a novel mmWave network designed for low-power, low-cost IoT devices. By addressing the key challenges of high power consumption, expensive hardware, and complex beam searching, we enable a more efficient and cost-effective solution for the imminent growth of IoT devices. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and performance of mmX in real-world scenarios, paving the way for widespread adoption of mmWave technology in IoT applications.
