ABSTRACT
With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of new
connected devices will come online, placing a huge strain on to-
day’s WiFi and cellular spectrum. This problem will be further
exacerbated by the fact that many of these IoT devices are low-
power devices that use low-rate modulation schemes and therefore
do not use the spectrum efficiently. Millimeter wave (mmWave)
technology promises to revolutionize wireless networks and solve
spectrum shortage problem through the usage of massive chunks
of high-frequency spectrum. However, adapting this technology
presents challenges. Past work has addressed challenges in using
mmWave for emerging applications, such as 5G, virtual reality
and data centers, which require multiple-gigabits-per-second links,
while having substantial energy and computing power. In contrast,
this paper focuses on designing a mmWave network for low-power,
low-cost IoT devices. We address the key challenges that prevent
existing mmWave technology from being used for such IoT devices.
First, current mmWave radios are power hungry and expensive.
Second, mmWave radios use directional antennas to search for the
best beam alignment. Existing beam searching techniques are com-
plex and require feedback from access points (AP), which makes
them unsuitable for low-power, low-cost IoT devices. We present
mmX, a novel mmWave network that addresses existing challenges
in exploiting mmWave for IoT devices. We implemented mmX and
evaluated it empirically.

1 INTRODUCTION
It is anticipated that by the year 2025, 75 billion Internet of Things
(IoT) devices will be installed, enabling new applications into every
aspect of our daily lives: from smart homes and security cameras
to smart cities and autonomous cars [28]. While these prospects
sound exciting, the reality is that billions of devices will require
wireless connectivity to the internet. In fact, many of these IoT
devices will be sensors, such as cameras, which require real-time
data streaming. The latest projections predict there will be 45 billion
cameras connected by 2022 [30]. Unfortunately, such estimations
will place a growing strain on requirements of wireless networks,
which cannot be supported by contemporary WiFi and cellular
networks. There are two main reasons for this shortage. First, WiFi
and cellular bands are already congested, and as such, cannot sup-
port additional wireless devices. Second, many of the IoT sensors
will be low-power devices, which transmit at rates much lower
than channel capacity, and since these devices use omni-directional
antennas, they are very inefficient in their use of shared spectrum.
Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands have the potential
to address this problem by offering multi-GHz of unlicensed band-
width, 200x more than the bandwidth allocated to today’s WiFi and
cellular networks [33]. Spectrum availability at such high frequen-
cies promises to enable higher network throughput than existing
wireless networks. Recent studies have explored this technology
in enabling high throughput wireless links for emerging applica-
tions, including 5G, virtual reality and data centers, which require
multiple-gigabits-per-second throughput, while having substantial
energy and computing power [3, 4, 31, 49].
In this paper, we focus on using mmWave to enable a wireless
network for low-cost, low-power IoT devices. This has two sig-
nificant advantages. First, it removes the load of low-power and
low-cost IoT devices from today’s WiFi spectrum. Second, direction-
ality property of mmWave communication allows us to perform
a spatial reuse of the spectrum, making the spectrum usage much

more efficient. As a result, a device that uses low rate will not impact
others. However, in order to use mmWave for low-cost low-power
IoT sensors, there are multiple challenges that need to be addressed.
The main challenges include:
High power consumption: Unfortunately, existing mm Wave
radios have high power consumption, which makes them unsuitable
for low-power IoT sensors. For example, recent mmWave platforms
developed by research communities such as OpenMilli, MiRa and
NI platform consumes 10-20 watts [1, 5, 47], far more than what a
camera or an entire low-power WiFi module consumes. Commercial
mmWave chipsets, such as Qualcomm QCA9500, consumes sev-
eral watts (excluding phased arrays power consumption) [39]. The
high power consumption of these radios is due to the high power
consumption of RF components operating at mmWave frequencies.
For example, a power amplifier and mixer operating at 24 GHz
consumes about 2.5W and 1W respectively [7, 13, 14]. In addition,
mmWave radios perform beam searches that make the hardware
more complex than traditional radios. In particular, phased arrays,
consisting of amplifiers and phase shifters, excessively increase the
power consumption of these radios.
Expensive hardware: Another disadvantage of mmWave is the
fact that present mmWave components are expensive. For example,
mmWave components such as amplifiers, mixers and phase shifters
each costs $220, $70, $150, respectively [7, 10, 13, 14]. Therefore,
a full mmWave radio cost hundreds of dollars, which is far more
than what a typical WiFi module costs. On the other hand, today’s
low-power IoT sensors, such as cameras, cost only tens of dollars
and consume less than a watt. Furnishing a camera with a radio
which costs hundreds of dollars and consumes tens of watts does
not seem feasible nor economically viable.
Beam searching: A major limitation of mmWave technology
is that their signals decay very quickly with distance, requiring
mmWave radios to focus their power into narrow beams to achieve
long range communication. Due to this limitation, mmWave com-
munication is only possible when the transmitter’s and receiver’s
beams are aligned. Recent research projects propose different beam
searching techniques for aligning mmWave beams [26, 38, 48]. How-
ever, these techniques are not suitable for low-cost, low-power IoT
devices, due to their computation complexity, energy requirements,
and hardware costs. Specifically, these techniques search for the di-
rection of the best beam alignment, which makes both communica-
tion protocols and hardware very complex, unsuitable for low-cost,
low-power IoT devices.
In this paper, we address these fundamental challenges, and as
a result, we develop a mmWave network for low cost, low-power
IoT devices. Our mmWave network works in both dynamic and
stationary environments. Such a network can be used in different
applications. For example, it can be used in smart homes to connect
IoT sensors (cameras, TVs, etc.) to a home hub. It can also enable
wireless connectivity to surveillance cameras in public areas such
as malls, banks, libraries, and parks.1 In fact, this wireless network
1 HD video streaming requires 8-10 Mbps application bit rate.
can even be used in autonomous cars to connect their high data
rate cameras and sensors to their in-vehicle access points.2
To eliminate the need for beam searching, we design a modula-
tion technique that exploits the high attenuation of mmWave signal
to modulate the signal over the air. Traditional mmWave systems
view the high attenuation as a harmful phenomenon that the radio
has to compensate for by using highly directional antenna which
requires beam searching. In contrast, we show that we can leverage
the directionality property to create modulation over the air. This
eliminates the need for beam searching as well as simplifying the
hardware. In other words, instead of modulating the signal first and
then transmitting it to the beam direction with the best channel
quality, we intelligently transmit a sine wave to different beams,
and since each beam experiences different attenuations, the signal is
modulated over the air. We will show that this approach enables us
to design a new architecture for mmWave radios, a far more efficient
and cost-effective architecture for imminent IoT applications.
Contributions: This paper makes the following contributions:3
• We design and build the first low-cost, low-power mmWave
hardware platform, which operates as a daughterboard for
Raspberry Pi. We believe this can help advanced mmWave
research in the networking community.4
• We design a new communication modulation scheme, which
eliminates the need of beam searching in mmWave radios.
This will make adaptation of mmWave communication easier
and less costly, paving the way toward many new applica-
tions for mmWave technology.
• We demonstrate the capability of our design in enabling a
mmWave network for IoT applications. Specifically, we show
that, in a representative IoT setup, mmX provides wireless
links with SNR of 10dB or more to all nodes even at 18
meters. The maximum data rate of mmX’s node is 100 Mbps
and it consumes 1.1 W. This results in an energy efficiency of
11nj/bit, which is even lower than existing WiFi modules [22]
2 BACKGROUND
The term Millimeter wave (mmWave) refers to very high frequency
RF signals. mmWave technology promises to revolutionize wireless
networks by offering multi-GHz of unlicensed bandwidth, which is
far more than the bandwidth allocated to today’s WiFi and cellular
networks [35]. However, in contrast to traditional wireless systems,
mmWave frequencies suffer from a large path loss, and therefore
mmWave radios use directional antennas to focus the signal power
in a narrow beam. Such directional antennas are implemented using
phased arrays. A phased array is an array of antennas, each with a
phase shifter.5 A Phase shifter control the phase of the signal on
each antenna which enables creating and steering a beam electroni-
cally [27]. Since mmWave communication is only possible when the
transmitter’s and receiver’s beams are aligned, existing mmWave
2 Autonomous cars will be equipped with at least 8 cameras for a 360-degree surround-
ing coverage [16].
3This work does not raise any ethical issues.
4Our current mmX’s node costs $110. However, this can be dramatically reduced with
mass production.
5Since the wavelength of mmWave signal is very small, mmWave antennas are small
and many of them can be packed into a small area.

systems use phased arrays and different searching techniques to
find the direction for the best beam alignment. Note, as shown in
Figure 2, when the line-of-sight path is not blocked, the node needs
to direct its beam toward the AP, and when the line-of-sight path
is blocked, the node needs to direct its beam toward a reflector in
the environment to use an indirect path. Past measurement studies
show that in mmWave communication, typically there are a few
paths [42] between two nodes. Therefore, existing radios need to
search for the directions of the available paths and pick the best one.
This requires the radios to have phased arrays and beam search-
ing algorithms, which makes designing mmWave networks more
challenging than designing traditional wireless networks equipped
with omni-directional antennas.
