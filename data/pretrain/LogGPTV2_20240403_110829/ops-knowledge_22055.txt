**Subject: Using Live Datastore with App Engine SDK for Local Development**

Is it possible to configure the App Engine SDK on my local machine to use the live datastore during development? Sometimes, working with live data streamlines my workflow.

If this is not feasible, is there an easy way to download or sync the live data to my development environment?

Thank you!

**Response:**

**Summary:**
We do not support using the real App Engine datastore with the `dev_appserver`. Even with the use of `remote_api`, the `dev_appserver` does not natively support this functionality.

**Detailed Explanation:**
If you still wish to implement this, you could develop a custom low-level API and create your own datastore abstraction that uses this API instead of the actual datastore. However, this would require a significant amount of development effort.

**Alternative Solution:**
A more practical approach is to create a servlet that pre-populates your local development datastore with the necessary data. This data can be either non-real or obfuscated real data. When you start the `dev_appserver`, you can trigger this servlet via a URL to populate your local database. This method has the added benefit of keeping your live data separate from your development environment, ensuring that you are not operating on live data with potentially unstable development code.

I hope this helps!
