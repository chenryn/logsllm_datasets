User: I configured source code of Cassandra 2.0.3 in eclipse. JDK:jdk1.7.0_45 Win 7-32 bits, python 2.7.3 python but cqlsh just doesnt start.  Please help me what can be the possible problem?
Assistant: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base10:'Unknown' 

It happens when you run Cassandra from sources, and version.properties file is missing. Just execute ant generate-eclipse-files in the cassandra folder, that will generate the file.
