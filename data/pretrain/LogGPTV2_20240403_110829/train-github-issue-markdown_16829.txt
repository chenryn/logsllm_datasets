 **Context:**
  * Playwright Version: 1.29.2
  * Operating System: macOS Ventura 13.1
  * Node.js version: v18.13 (but tested 16.19 as well)
  * Browser: Chromium
  * Extra: 
    * Does happen for both M1 and Intel chips
    * We use the mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.29.2-focal docker image in CI, the difference is the same when comparing local vs in the image.

**Code Snippet**  
More importantly than the test: This snippet has to be run locally and then
inside the docker image / some sort of CI for the bug to happen.
    import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";
    test("Onboarding Step 1", async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto("/");
      await page.getByText("Login").click();
      await expect(page.getByTestId("onboarding-heading")).toContainText(
        "Onboarding Step 1"
      );
      await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(
        "onboarding-step-1.png",
        { fullPage: true }
      );
    });
**Describe the bug**
Screenshot have flaky dimensions. Our locally generated, full-page,
screenshots sometimes differ from those created inside docker by 1px,
sometimes 2px height. If running the same test multiple times in the same
environment (either docker or local), the screenshots match all the time. All
tests are run with headless chromium. I've also experimented with any
antialiasing and font rendering setup. This did not help either.
Result, for example:
        Error: Screenshot comparison failed:
          Expected an image 1280px by 1740px, received 1280px by 1739px. 
        Call log:
          - expect.toHaveScreenshot with timeout 5000ms
          -   verifying given screenshot expectation
          - taking page screenshot
          -   disabled all CSS animations
          - Expected an image 1280px by 1740px, received 1280px by 1739px. 
          - waiting 100ms before taking screenshot
          - taking page screenshot
          -   disabled all CSS animations
          - captured a stable screenshot
          - Expected an image 1280px by 1740px, received 1280px by 1739px.
