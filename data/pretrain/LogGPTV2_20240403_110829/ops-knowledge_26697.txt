Upload data to S3: Select the S3 service in the AWS console, create a bucket, and upload files or objects to the bucket. 4. Access S3 objects: In the EC2 instance, use the AWS SDK or CLI tool to access the objects in the S3 storage bucket, and you can read and write data and other operations. 5. Automated management: Use AWS's automated tools such as Lambda to achieve flexible and automated computing and storage solution management in EC2 and S3 services. It should be noted that when using EC2 and S3 services, attention should be paid to data security and backup, and appropriate security policies and backup schemes should be used to ensure that data will not be lost or leaked.
