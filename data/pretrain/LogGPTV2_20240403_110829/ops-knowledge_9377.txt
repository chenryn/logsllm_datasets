User: I am trying to write an application(I am using python) to have a copy of a remote machines directory structure in my local machine (not the actual content of the files in the remote machine).
Once I store it in my local machine, I want to be be able to perform the following operations on my local copy of the tree structure
"ls"
"ls /etc"
"ls /etc/bin/yahoo"
and see the listing. Also if I change/add a dir/file name in the remote machine, I want to have the ability to easily update it in my local data structure.
UPDATE:
Some people suggested using Nested Set Model. I think updating it is an expensive process.
Assistant: I think you should declare a class which has a list of its own type. Basically a simple tree structure. 
For ls:
Just dispay all the child recursively.
For any new addition:
Add it to the parent directory node's child list as a child.
