It seems like you have Python 2.7 and `virtualenv` installed via MacPorts on your Mac, but you are encountering an issue where the `virtualenv` command is not recognized. Hereâ€™s a more detailed and professional response to help you resolve this:

**Issue:**
You have Python 2.7 and `virtualenv` (version 1.6.1) installed via MacPorts, but when you try to create a new virtual environment using the command `virtualenv demo_venv --no-site-packages`, you receive the error `-bash: virtualenv: command not found`.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the `virtualenv` executable is in your system's PATH. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Verify Installation:**
   First, confirm that `virtualenv` is installed by checking the list of installed MacPorts packages:
   ```sh
   port installed py27-virtualenv
   ```

2. **Locate the `virtualenv` Executable:**
   Find the location of the `virtualenv` executable. It should be in the `bin` directory of the MacPorts installation for Python 2.7. You can use the following command to locate it:
   ```sh
   which -a py27-virtualenv
   ```
   If the `which` command does not find it, you can manually search for it:
   ```sh
   find /opt/local -name "virtualenv"
   ```

3. **Add to PATH:**
   Once you have located the `virtualenv` executable, you need to add its directory to your PATH. For example, if the `virtualenv` executable is located at `/opt/local/bin/virtualenv`, you can add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc`):
   ```sh
   export PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH
   ```

4. **Reload Shell Configuration:**
   After updating the PATH, reload your shell configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bash_profile  # or .zshrc, .bashrc, etc.
   ```

5. **Test the Command:**
   Try running the `virtualenv` command again to see if it is now recognized:
   ```sh
   virtualenv demo_venv --no-site-packages
   ```

If you still encounter issues, you may need to create a symbolic link to the `virtualenv` executable in a directory that is already in your PATH. For example:
```sh
ln -s /opt/local/bin/virtualenv /usr/local/bin/virtualenv
```

This should make the `virtualenv` command available from any terminal session.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully use the `virtualenv` command.
