Certainly! To enhance the clarity and professionalism of your KQL (Kusto Query Language) query for identifying software affected by the Nobelium campaign, you can provide more context and use a more descriptive approach. Here's an optimized version:

```kql
// Query to identify devices with software affected by the Nobelium campaign
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| where CveId == 'CVE-2020-0002'  // Replace with the actual CVE ID associated with the Nobelium campaign
| project 
    DeviceId, 
    DeviceName, 
    SoftwareVendor, 
    SoftwareName, 
    SoftwareVersion, 
    CveId, 
    VulnerabilitySeverityLevel  // Include severity level for better context
| order by VulnerabilitySeverityLevel desc  // Order by severity level for prioritization
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comment**: Added a comment at the top to describe the purpose of the query.
2. **CVE ID**: Ensure the `CveId` is correct and replace `'CVE-2020-0002'` with the actual CVE ID associated with the Nobelium campaign.
3. **Additional Fields**: Included `CveId` and `VulnerabilitySeverityLevel` in the projection to provide more context.
4. **Ordering**: Ordered the results by `VulnerabilitySeverityLevel` in descending order to prioritize more severe vulnerabilities.

This query will help you identify and prioritize the devices and software affected by the Nobelium campaign.
