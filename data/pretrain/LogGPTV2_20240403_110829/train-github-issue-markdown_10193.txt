I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that my query is not a duplicate. According to the documentation, by default, a page is cached for 25 seconds in development mode. However, I noticed that when I make changes to the API or even modify the JSX of a page, the page updates automatically, both through Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and when manually refreshing the page using F5.

This leads me to wonder: what exactly is being cached here? Additionally, could you please clarify what `maxInactiveAge` specifically refers to?

### Environment
- **Next.js Version:** 5.0.0
- **Node.js Version:** 9.5.0
- **Operating System:** Windows 10

Thank you for your assistance!
