  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
According to the docs a page is cached for 25sec in development by default.
However, when you change something on the API-side or even in the JSX of a
page, the page will update (both by HMR and when calling manually using F5).
So I'm curious, what exactly is cached here, what exactly do you specify with
`maxInactiveAge`?
