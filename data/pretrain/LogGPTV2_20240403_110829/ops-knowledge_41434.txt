User: How to protect the security of web application? Please describe some of the most common web security attack techniques and defenses.
Assistant: The security methods for protecting Web applications are as follows: 1. Input verification: Input verification is an important part of protecting Web applications. Input verification can prevent intentional or unintentional attacks. 2. Encryption: Use encryption for all data of the web application, including sensitive data and cross-site scripting (XSS). 3. Control access: Control the access of Web applications to ensure that only authenticated users can use them. 4. Update software and patches: Update all software and patches to prevent known attacks. 5. Strong Passwords: Make sure all users use strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access. The most common web security attack techniques: 1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious scripts into users' browsers, thereby organizing attacks. Defensive measures: Filter HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in user input, and use techniques such as verification codes. 2. SQL injection attack: SQL injection is an attack that exploits a vulnerability in a web application to execute arbitrary SQL queries in the back-end database of the web application. Defensive measures: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, and implement access controls. 3. DDos attack:- A DDos (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is an attack that makes a web application stop responding by sending too many requests to it. Defensive measures: Use techniques such as anti-hosting services and load balancers and limiting request rates. 4. CSRF attack: A CSRF attack is an attacker who uses a flaw in a browser to perform malicious operations without authorization. Defensive measures: Use techniques such as random tokens and or throttling form requests.
