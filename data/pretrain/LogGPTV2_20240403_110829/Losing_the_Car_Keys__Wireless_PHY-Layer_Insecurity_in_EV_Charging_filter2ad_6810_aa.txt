Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) are proliferating quickly, along with
the charging infrastructure for them. A new generation of
charger technologies is emerging, handling more sensitive
data and undertaking more complex interactions, while us-
ing the charging cable as the communication channel. This
channel is used not only for charging control, but will soon
handle billing, vehicle-to-grid operation, internet access and
provide a platform for third-party apps — all with a public
interface to the world.
We highlight the threat posed by wireless attacks on the
physical-layer of the Combined Charging System (CCS), a
major standard for EV charging that is deployed in many
thousands of locations worldwide and used by seven of the
ten largest auto manufacturers globally. We show that de-
sign choices in the use of power-line communication (PLC)
make the system particularly prone to popular electromag-
netic side-channel attacks. We implement the ﬁrst wireless
eavesdropping tool for PLC networks and use it to observe
the ISO 15118 network implementation underlying CCS, in
a measurement campaign of 54 real charging sessions, using
modern electric vehicles and state-of-the-art CCS chargers.
We ﬁnd that the unintentional wireless channel is sufﬁcient
to recover messages in the vast majority of cases, with trafﬁc
intercepted from an adjacent parking bay showing 91.8% of
messages validating their CRC32 checksum.
By examining the recovered trafﬁc, we further ﬁnd a
host of privacy and security issues in existing charging in-
frastructure including plaintext MAC-layer trafﬁc recovery,
widespread absence of TLS in public locations and leakage
of private information, including long-term unique identi-
ﬁers. Of particular concern, elements of the recovered data
are being used to authorise billing in existing charging im-
plementations.
We discuss the implications of pervasive susceptibility
to known electromagnetic eavesdropping techniques, extract
lessons learnt for future development and propose speciﬁc
improvements to mitigate the problems in existing chargers.

Introduction
The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) as a contemporary and fu-
ture transport mechanism has been swift in recent years and
continues to accelerate, helped by prevailing attitudes, tech-
nological advances and notable personalities contributing in
the area. There are already widespread government plans to
eradicate fossil-fuel vehicles in cities [61], states [28] and
countries [9] in the coming years.
As EV technology advances rapidly, the availability of
charging infrastructure has become a challenge for users,
who require access both to private charging points at home
and public ones on longer journeys. The lack of sufﬁcient
charging points is noted as a slowing inﬂuence on adoption
of electric mobility [62] and this has prompted endeavours to
expand the infrastructure, both from governments recognis-
ing the potential public good and from competing EV manu-
facturers who understand that having the best infrastructure
makes their vehicles more appealing to purchasers. There
are already multi-billion dollar pulibc deployment plans in

progress [18] and predictions of worldwide numbers ex-
ceed 50 million chargers by 2025 if private systems are in-
cluded [2].
With several major charging standards in existence, the
race to become the dominant one has reached a fervour in
recent years and a new generation of high-power charging
systems has emerged. But the pressure to achieve rapid ex-
pansion has so often been seen to inhibit secure implementa-
tion. Users demand charging systems that are consistent and
convenient, but with such drive for the adoption of electric
mobility, it is critical that they are also secure. The security
community has raised concerns in the past that standards do
not fully address security and privacy issues [4, 8, 72], as
well as noting vulnerabilities in back-end and payment sys-
tems of earlier charging system deployments [35, 19].
Meanwhile the complexity of developing all the infras-
tructure required for a secured charging network is enor-
mous. As Figure 1 shows, vehicle charging involves inter-
action between the vehicle, the owner, the charger opera-
tor, a payment gateway and the grid regulator. This requires
establishing communication links capable of supporting the
higher-level protocols for this interaction, within a dynamic
and untrusted environment, where many thousands of users
come and go. It also necessitates trust relationships between
all the participants to ensure each is acting legitimately.
In light of the challenges this infrastructure development
faces and the acknowledged side-channel vulnerabilities that
exposed cabling presents, we undertook to investigate the se-
curity of the charging cable communication.
We make the following speciﬁc contributions:
1. Demonstrate that the use of powerline communication,
and its speciﬁc conﬁguration in CCS, makes systems
particularly vulnerable to EM eavesdropping
2. Develop an eavesdropping system for HomePlug GP
and the ISO15118 PHY-layer
3. Conduct a real-world measurement campaign, demon-
strating the widespread nature of the problem
4. Highlight the potential for privacy violation and user
tracking with existing systems
5. Propose countermeasures to mitigate the capabilities of
an eavesdropper
Our ﬁndings are relevant to thousands of chargers across
Europe and North America [29, 67], along with having im-
plications for ongoing deployments both in public locations
and private homes.
2 Background
The availability of EV charging infrastructure is growing
enormously. Early, simple alternating-current chargers are
being superseded by a new generation of charging technolo-
gies that provide greater charging power and advanced func-
tionality. The greater power is provided by the use of direct-
current (DC) charging, allowing an enormous increase in
current delivery over previous alternating-current designs.
Public DC charging stations currently well exceed the 3kW
power levels commonly available in a home, with 50kW sup-
plies plentiful and those providing up to 350kW soon to ap-
pear [30][38]. But the improvements in power are only part
of the beneﬁt of this new generation of technologies. The
communication capabilities are also vital to enable a host of
new uses:
Reactive charging
allows a vehicle to vary its charging
process based on electricity price or expected time of depar-
ture.
Automatic billing or “plug-and-charge” allows a vehicle
to authorise billing of its owner for charging, without the
owner explicitly interacting with it. Aside from the obvious
convenience beneﬁt, the same capability also allows the user
to ‘roam’ between charging providers with a seamless expe-
rience as cross-provider billing is handled automatically as
well.
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) makes use of bidirectional power
ﬂow to allow the vehicle to deliver energy as well as con-
sume it. As energy prices ﬂuctuate with demand, the vehicle
can either act as a storage battery for a user’s home or sell
energy back to the grid on demand. This can bring economic
beneﬁts for the user and stability improvement for the grid
operator.
External payment
is commonly provided by RFID
cards [19], apps that communicate with the charger sepa-
rately or card payment terminals. Additional systems ex-
ist though, for payment through separate providers or via a
blockchain network [64, 74, 6, 26].
Additional services
that operate in conjunction with
charging are proposed [47].
In a private environment this
might comprise access to the local network to communicate
with smart-home devices or make use of domestic internet
service and avoid mobile network charges. At public charg-
ing stations site-speciﬁc services such as loyalty schemes, to-
vehicle delivery, parking charges or ‘where-have-I-parked’
reminders can operate, with middleware layers to support an
app ecosystem in commercial development [22]. Internet ac-
cess can also be made available for connected vehicles in ar-
eas without mobile network coverage, such as underground
parking complexes.
Examples of each are in production use and deployment is

(a) Two charging cables are used by CCS. The Combo 1 and Combo 2
plugs are dominant in the US and Europe respectively, while other loca-
tions adopt one or the other. DC power is delivered by the large conduc-
tors at the bottom of the plug, meanwhile communication happens over
the Control Pilot and Protective Earth lines (red and blue, respectively).
(b) CCS high-level and low-level signalling share the same communica-
tion lines. The corresponding ISO 15118 PLC and IEC 61851 systems
have their signals superposed at the physical layer. The PLC provides a
standard IP stack for use by charging trafﬁc and other services.

becoming more widespread. The underpinning communica-
tion mechanisms go beyond indicating presence and readi-
ness to charge, also providing a general-purpose channel for
software operating in the vehicle and charger. Figure 1 shows
the potential extent of communication during charging. The
vehicle can demand current ﬂow, the charger can provide tar-
iff information for reactive charging or reverse current de-
mands for vehicle-to-grid, and the two can interact with ex-
ternal parties for automatic billing or to provide additional
services.
Four major next-generation charging systems exist:
CHAdeMO1, Supercharger2, GB/T 202343 and the Com-
bined Charging System (CCS)4. Each uses the charging ca-
ble for primary communication: CHAdeMO, Supercharger
and GB/T 20234 make use of CAN-Bus, whilst CCS makes
use of powerline communication (PLC).
We examine the CCS standard as it has the most exten-
sive, current functionality (supporting reactive charging, au-
tomatic billing and additional services) and has been adopted
by seven out of the ten largest automobile manufacturers by
production numbers [57]. In addition it is being integrated
by competing manufacturers, such as Tesla [42].
2.1 Combined Charging System (CCS)
The Combined Charging System (CCS) is an amalgamation
of standards governing all physical and logical elements of
the charging infrastructure; from the physical connector to

the protocols for automated billing. Figure 2a shows the
charging plug, while Figure 2b illustrates the communica-
tions undertaken. The communication between vehicle and
charger is standardised as ISO 15118. This uses powerline
communication (PLC) over the Control Pilot (CP) and Pro-
tective Earth (PE) lines of the charging cable. The PLC
shares the lines with the older IEC 61851 signalling system
for backwards-compatibility reasons, with the signals super-
posed at the physical layer. The speciﬁc PLC implemen-
tation is HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP) [5], a derivative of
the commonplace broadband LAN technologies sold to con-
sumers, that has been modiﬁed to support pairing between
devices with no pre-shared key, and to be more robust to
noise. Atop the PLC, ISO 15118 communication provides a
full IP stack to act as the general-purpose channel. The same
standard also deﬁnes interactions for identiﬁcation, authori-
sation, tariff provision and control. Communication persists
throughout the duration of charging and allows charge pa-
rameters to be varied quickly.
CCS provides reactive charging by allowing a charger to
present current and future tariff information to the vehicle,
which can then make charging requests based on a user’s set-
tings. The user may have a price preference or timing con-
straints for when the vehicle should be charged. Contract-
based automated billing is implemented by having a user’s
contract with a charging provider represented by a public-
key certiﬁcate stored on the vehicle. A complex public-key
infrastructure (PKI) then allows the vehicle to authenticate
the charger, the charger to validate the charging contract and
the provider to produce veriﬁable metering receipts. The
same PKI is used to underpin the TLS tunnel for protecting
trafﬁc.

Competing automated billing approaches do exist how-
ever, that do not use the contract-based approach, nor rely
on the PKI. Blockchain-based payment systems, seeking to
protect the user’s privacy from charging operators, simply
use the communication channel as a building block for their
own service [6, 26]. A system named “AutoCharge” [58]
is also used in some networks [33, 56] to enable automated
billing for even those users whose vehicles do not support
the required certiﬁcates. The AutoCharge system is based on
a simpliﬁed ISO 15118 use-case [52] that uses only vehicle-
provided identiﬁers to match the vehicle to a customer record
at the provider.
As there is a general-purpose channel, any IP communi-
cation is supported for additional functionality. Fast internet
access is suggested in the ISO 15118 standard and a selec-
tion of data collection, targeted marketing, on-demand enter-
tainment and third-party app platforms are emerging to take
advantage of this [6, 22].
2.2 CCS Security
Communication security is considered in many of the sys-
tems making up CCS standard; with trafﬁc encryption avail-
able at the PHY layer, TLS at the Transport layer and XML
Security at the Application layer [55, 48].
At the PHY layer, the HPGP PLC network maintains
a shared secret key called the Network Membership Key
(NMK), with ephemeral Network Encryption Keys (NEKs)
rotated periodically. All MAC-layer trafﬁc is encrypted via
AES-128 using the NEK. However, HPGP security is based
upon a private-network model, while EV charging is funda-
mentally a public-network model. To adapt the technology
to the use case, additions were made to HPGP to incorporate
an initial association protocol5, during which the vehicle and
charger verify that they are connected to each other and are
not communicating with the wrong party due to crosstalk on
their communication cable. The determination is known as
Signal-Level Attenuation Characterisation (SLAC) and is il-
lustrated in Figure 3. The protocol involves the vehicle send-
ing a series of sounding messages, for which the charger re-
ports the measured attenuation. If multiple chargers respond
due to crosstalk, the one reporting the least attenuation is se-
lected and communication commences. Once a charger is se-
lected, a Network Membership Key is created by the charger
and used to establish a private network. The key is then sent
to the vehicle in the ﬁnal CM SLAC MATCH.CNF message of
the protocol. The SLAC protocol can operate in a secure
mode, with mutual authentication and encrypted communi-
cation, but this capability is optional if supported by both
parties. Indeed, despite the availability of this mechanism,
the ISO 15118 standard speciﬁes that SLAC only operates in
its plaintext mode, leaving message security to TLS.

lishment in HomePlug GreenPHY. If the secure mode is sup-
ported by both parties and enabled in initialisation then step
3 occurs, allowing the messages in steps 5–7 to be signed
and the one in step 7 also encrypted.
Once a network is established, a TLS connection is only
created under certain conditions.
If contract-based auto-
mated billing is used then TLS is required, similarly for the
discovery of additional services, but only when they are ones
deﬁned in the ISO 15118 use cases. When charging is ex-
ternally authorised, no TLS is required for the control traf-
ﬁc [48]. The options for external authorisation are open; in-
cluding RFID cards, mobile-app networks, manual authori-
sation by a charger operator or some other service operat-
ing on the charger. The method need not be external to the
charger, only external to the ISO 15118 scope. For all other
trafﬁc not managed through a standard use case, security is
left to the implementer. In the alternative payment example
of [26], independent IP communication is undertaken com-
pletely outside the scope of ISO 15118 (although secured in
an SSH tunnel in that case).
