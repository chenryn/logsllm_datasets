sinkhole, in TLD and the DNS Zones authorities respectively
when we considered the geolocation of the client preﬁxes in the
ECS enabled requests compared to only taking into account the
location of the recursive IPs. The source of the DNS requests
can be traced back in greater detail when ECS is enabled.
When looking into the origin network preﬁxes of the
requests, we identiﬁed some noteworthy cases of networks
that queried our domain names in the sinkhole Authority.
Among the requests received by our sinkholed domains, the
preﬁxes 180.94.82.0/24 and 180.94.94.0/24 (two networks in
Afghanistan and delegated to “AFGHANTELECOM Gov-
ernment Communication Network.”) appear to resolve two
domain names related with APT activity in the past. Addition-
ally, we also see frequent DNS queries to our APT domains
from Academic networks, with 128.237.28.0/24 delegated
to Carnegie Mellon University, 147.46.121.0/24 delegated to
Seoul National University, and 171.67.70.0/24 delegated to
Stanford University being some prominent examples. These
DNS queries could be research related (e.g., by dynamically
running malware that communicated with our sinkholed do-
mains names) rather than infections. Finally, we also observe
requests coming from Security vendors with 155.64.38.0/24
delegated to Symantec Corporation and 103.245.47.0/24 del-
egated to McAfee making requests to both our APT related
domain names and typosquatting domains.
Prior to ECS, we would have only seen that “someone is
using GoogleDNS” to resolve these domains. With ECS, we
could identify speciﬁc networks engaged in research, security
vendors, and governmental activities. We remind the reader
that all this information comes from DNS alone and is off-path
of any TCP analysis. However, it could be argued that even
with legacy DNS requests authorities can have the same level
of subnet visibility as clients that would not use ECS enabled
open recursives such as Google’s public DNS, would resort
to a local recursive solution thus still revealing their subnet
to the authorities. In order to test this argument, we randomly
chose one day of DNS requests from each authority and looked
at the number of ECS-client “/24” preﬁxes for ECS enabled
requests and number of “/24” from legacy DNS requests after
removing bogon IP preﬁxes from both datasets. Table III shows
that we can see more client “/24s” in the ECS enabled trafﬁc
for the TLD and the DNS Zones authorities than in the legacy
DNS trafﬁc, even though as we have shown above that legacy
DNS trafﬁc makes up the majority of the daily DNS trafﬁc for
these authorities. While ECS only reveals up to 24 bits of the
IP address of the clients, authorities can see a wider range of
client subnets than legacy DNS. We can see that ECS can be
used for extracting more granular information about the nature
of the clients than in legacy DNS queries.

Fig. 13: The distribution and density of the geographic location of the recursives and clients making ECS-enabled DNS requests to the
authorities. The red dots show the location of the ECS recursives while the location of the clients behind the requests are in purple. We can
see that by considering the geolocation of the client preﬁxes, which is only available in the ECS-enabled requests, an authority is getting a
much more granular view of the source of the DNS requests. For the TLD and DNS Zones we calculate the distribution for a random day in
June 2015 and June 2019, respectively, while in the sinkhole authority we use the full dataset.
forwarded for most of the clients, by considering ﬁgure 14, the
origin of a request can be attributed to a single organization or
ISP. On the other hand, we observe 130,261 queries in which
the recursives respond with the full “/32” IPv4 address of the
clients. By looking more closely at these queries, we see that
the announced preﬁx for the corresponding clients is smaller
or equal to a “/24”. Thus there is no point in forwarding the
full “/32” IPv4 address, and that the last octet from all the
“/32s” forwarded was “1”. The vast majority of the recursives
(118 out of the 122) exhibiting this behavior were attributed
to different organizations in China and did not forward any
preﬁx smaller than a full IPv4 address. We observe queries
for all of the domain names corresponding to our authority
from 432 different clients. Considering that these recursives
do not forward any preﬁx smaller than a “/32” for all the IPv4
client addresses that they serve and the fact that the last octet
is “1” for all the clients served there is a high probability that
these recursives are misconﬁgured.
To sum up, using passive DNS datasets, we showed that
ECS enabled trafﬁc makes up a considerable portion of the
daily DNS trafﬁc the past years. Contrary to legacy DNS
requests, ECS enabled queries provide more granular client
information to authorities. This can be a valuable tool for
researchers using DNS lookup data (e.g., running a sinkhole
as we have illustrated) in order to better understand the nature
of the clients that are querying a domain name.
D. ECS Speakers and CDNs
We have seen that ECS has a high adoption rate among
domains in the Alexa top million. Given that the goal of
ECS is to improve CDN performance by enabling more
accurate identiﬁcation of a user’s location [15], [39], this raises
the question of whether these domains actually use ECS to
facilitate content delivery. As CDNs rely on servers in multiple
locations around the world, we expect resolutions of ECS-
enabled domains from different vantage points to result in
different IP addresses, exhibiting this way a consistent CDN
behavior. In this subsection, we will show that only a few
ECS-enabled domains appear to resolve to more than a single
IP address. Consequently, there is no real performance beneﬁt
for the vast majority of domains that currently support ECS in
the Alexa top million.
Fig. 14: The distribution of the DNS resolution requests compared
to the CIDR preﬁx length from where they originated. ECS could
have provided the same level of service with the respective announced
CIDR we see in the plot. Thus, the client’s /24 was submitted with
no value for the client.
2) ECS Scope Size: Another interesting observation with
respect to ECS-enabled resolution requests has to do with the
size of the network the recursive is reporting to our authorities.
We correlated the preﬁx reported by the recursives with the
preﬁx containing the host addresses. From the eight billion
ECS-enabled requests in our sinkhole authority, we could
identify 75,138 unique preﬁxes for 99.8% of the requests. We
were not able to identify 3,186 networks for 0.2% of the ECS-
enabled DNS requests that correspond to IPv6 networks that
are out of the scope of the current experiment and subnets that
were not available on the Route Views [45] project database.
From the available networks, 7,030 were “/24” delegations
while 68,074 had a smaller preﬁx. We also note 34 cases of
networks with a bigger preﬁx than a “/24”. Figure 14, shows
the distribution of the preﬁxes where IP addresses reported by
ECS are delegated to.
Regarding the distribution of the client preﬁxes that re-
cursives forward to our sinkhole authority, we see that the
signiﬁcant majority of the ECS client preﬁxes (99.8%) are
“/24s” and we do not observe any preﬁx less speciﬁc than
a “/24” exchanged. Although only the “/24” portion was

number of IP addresses, in contrast to ECS-enabled domains and the
average Alexa domain.
Fig. 17: CDF of the number of IP addresses per domain name (log-

The majority of Alexa domains have a very small number of IPs that
they resolve to even when using ECS, in fact the majority over 62%
only resolves in one IP, observing no beneﬁt from the use of ECS.
1000 associated IPs was aggregated into a single group so that
the resulting plots are easier to read and understand.
We further correlate each IP address with its associated
country of origin in order to provide a better understanding of
the geographical diversity of the IP infrastructure that hosts
each domain. For this purpose, we used the MAXMIND
GeoIP2 [34] country database. For each domain, we counted
the number of different countries it resolved to and presented
the results in Figure 16. Taking geographic location into
consideration, less than 20% of the known CDN domains
and the vast majority (70%) of both the Alexa and ECS-
enabled domains resolve to only a single country. Again for
visualization purposes, we set the maximum number of distinct
countries to be 40.
It is clear from Figures 16 and 15 that most of the Alexa
domains do not share many of the CDN characteristics (the
networks that ECS was originally proposed for), even though
they eagerly support ECS. Also, behavior-wise, the generic
Alexa domains and the ECS-enabled Alexa domains display
very similar attributes (although not exactly the same).
In order to further examine the behavior of popular do-
mains from Alexa that support ECS and to examine the utility
of ECS for these domains, we conducted a further active
experiment with the purpose of demonstrating the variety
of RDATA when ECS is used. We take the entire Alexa
1M list of domains and submit queries using a modiﬁed
resolver that allows us to specify the client preﬁx we will
send to the authority. For a list of geographically diverse
IP addresses to use as ECS preﬁxes, we used the publicly
available AWS IP-ranges, which provides us with actual IPs
that are geographically diverse as is the AWS infrastructure
VIII-A. We repeat the experiment for 26 different IP ranges
and present them in ﬁgures 17 and 18.
It is very clear from Figure 18 that the overwhelming
majority (over 98%) of Alexa domains are hosted in only
one country. This means that there are small geographical
beneﬁts from the use of ECS, even when we query the domains
from client subnets that correspond to locations all around
Fig. 16: CDF of the number of distinct countries for IP addresses
per domain name (log-scale) in the three datasets. CDN domains are
distributed in multiple countries around the globe to better deliver
their content, whereas ECS-enabled domains are mostly contained in
the same country.
To perform the experiments, we created a list of 133
veriﬁed CDNs by starting with a list of known, popular
CDN domains and supplementing it with additional domains
discovered in real-world network data. We used this set of
CDN domains to make observations about the operation of the
respective networks. Using the ISP DNS dataset collected by
a large ISP in North America over the ﬁrst ﬁve days of April
2019, we counted the number of IP addresses each domain
(and CDN subdomains) resolves to, both in the CDN and
the Alexa list. We observed that 50% of the veriﬁed CDN
domains resolved to more than 50 distinct IP addresses in
our passive DNS dataset. In sharp contrast, 80% of all ECS-
enabled domain names from the Alexa top million resolved to
less than seven distinct IP address, and less than 5% resolved
to more than 50 IP addresses. Figure 15 shows the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the number of IP addresses that
a domain name resolves to for each of these data sets. Since
the number of IP addresses for some domain names exceeded
400,000, we set an upper bound of 1000 IPs for each domain
name for visualization purposes. Every domain with at least

hosting the domain, Alexa domains exhibit even less variability and
are in line with our passive measurements.

the world. Similarly Figure 17 veriﬁes that our passive DNS
measurements are consistent with active global measurements
and shows that the hosting infrastructure of popular Alexa
domains is not particularly diverse, especially compared with
the CDN diversity we observe at Figure 15. The vast majority
of Alexa domains, even those that support ECS, only utilize
one IP address, and 95% of them use less than four IP
addresses.
Based on the observed behavior, it appears that the beneﬁt
from the use of ECS is not signiﬁcant (or apparent) for a
large number of these domains. This reinforces our intuition
that ECS is sometimes misused. It is also apparent that even
for the case of the limited number of Alexa domains that point
to many IP addresses, these IPs are not necessarily located
in different places around the world. On the contrary, most of
the them can be found in the same region. In these cases, the
users’ anonymity could be waived without any beneﬁt for them.
Given that, in the following subsection, we will measure the
diversity of the infrastructure of these domains to understand
how users’ information travel during a DNS resolution request
and in which cases other entities can obtain this information.
E. Infrastructure Diversity
To present how different entities are involved in the resolu-
tion of a domain, we analyze the infrastructure that hosts ECS-
enabled domain names. Since routing on the Internet is based
on Autonomous Systems (AS), BGP announcements, and
peering agreements between ASes, we focus on the distance of
the ASes that host ECS-enabled authorities from the ASes that
host the respective services for those domains (i.e., RDATA).
Ideally, we would want to know the different hops a packet
will make before reaching the authority and the respective
service. However, network packets are expected to take several
different paths, depending on factors like peering agreements,
congestion, load balancing, etc. which make it particularly hard
to predict [17], [18], [33], [37].
In order to demonstrate that the DNS packets traveling
to an authority are likely to take a different routing path
from consecutive communication with the actual service the

distribution and collapsing the empty space. This distorts the diagonal

domain offers (e.g., web server that serves HTML context),
and therefore reveal information about the client to multiple
other entities, we base our analysis on the ASes that host
the authority and the returned IP address for an ECS-enabled
domain. We also show that there are entities positioned on the
path between a global recursive and the authority of multiple
domain names, which are in a position to collect all clients’
information just from DNS resolution requests.
For a given ECS-enabled domain name, if both the au-
thority and the respective RDATA [35], [36] — referred to
hereon as the service — are hosted within the same AS, then
there is a probability that DNS leaks will be limited to the
same path as the TCP connection that will follow. Currently,

completely different routing path than the subsequent service
connection (as shown in Figure 2). In that case, the ECS subnet
information is leaked to all ASes between the resolver and the
authority.
When a given ECS-enabled domain is served by an au-
thority in a different AS than the service, then inevitably the
DNS packet will take a different route and pass through at
least one different AS (that of the authority). Thus, in the best
