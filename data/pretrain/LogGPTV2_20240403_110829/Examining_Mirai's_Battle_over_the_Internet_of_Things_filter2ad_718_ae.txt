203,920 hosts that matched the Mirai fingerprint. This number is
significantly lower than the peak size of Mirai in 2017 [8], but we
find a similar total number as the 200,000 - 300,000 reported by
[8]. While our honeypots would welcome any telnet traffic, we see
that with 87% of all telnet compromization attempts, Mirai and its
siblings are the dominant player in the IoT malware arena. Table 2
lists the top variants and how many hosts were observed in our
study, the largest one infecting more than 75,000 hosts. We have
identified 39 variants in total, with only the top 10 being advertised
from more than 2,000 hosts during the duration of our study. The
full list of variants covered in this paper is in the appendix.

6.1 Infection characteristics
As Mirai spreads as a worm, the growth of the infections is in
principle exponential, but is naturally bounded by the total number
of vulnerable machines. After the rapid expansion, the infection
will therefore reach a steady state or die out depending on the
parameters of injection and curing. Indeed, Antonakakis et al. [8]
show that Mirai rapidly grew in size at the beginning, but after
a while the total number of infected devices fluctuated between
200,000 and 300,000. When we measure Mirai a year later, we still
find the ecosystem of Mirai-infected IoT devices in a steady state,
except the infected population having significantly decreased.
Epidemiologically speaking, the memory-bound infection fol-
lows a mixed SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) or SIR (Suscepti-
ble-Infected-Recovered) process [28]. When we measure the infec-
tion rate, we see that on average 27,182 devices are newly infected
each day with a standard deviation of 18, 381. With the curing rate
being almost identical – 26, 757 devices are cleaned up every day
with 19,153 as standard deviation –, it is clear why the ecosystem
is in a steady state. We empirically determine a basic reproduction
number of R0 = 1.0033, which is surprisingly low given the aggres-
sive scanning and infection behavior, and barely enough for the
worm to sustain itself. As Mirai targets IPs randomly, it is highly
unlikely for pockets of undiscovered, vulnerable devices to still
exist, hence new infections can only come from newly introduced
vulnerable devices or from taking over devices from someone else.
Indeed, we find that the battle over the Internet of Things is
largely a zero-sum game, with significantly fluctuating market
shares between variants. Figure 5 shows the distribution of infected
devices over the largest botnets, which surprisingly shows that the
original Mirai is today only one player among many, and variants
that evolved from it have gained significant market share. Surpris-
ingly so, this competition between Mirai variants has received only
little attention to date. When we count the number of devices in-
fected by a particular strain at any given moment in time, we see
momentary explosions in activity, where suddenly a lot of hosts get
newly infected by a variant. As shown in figure 6, this is especially
true for smaller strains such as Cult, MASUTA or OWARI, but even
the main players in the ecosystem experience frequent jolts in in-
stallation size. These spikes are counterintuitive, as brute forcing
from thousands of infected hosts towards random IPs should lead

to a continuous influx of new infections, and can be explained with
the loaders and reboots as we show later.
6.1.1 Transitions between botnets. While new IoT devices are con-
stantly being added to the Internet, awareness and improved secu-
rity (such as omitting open admin interfaces or default credentials)
should over time reduce the attack surface. This would mean that in
order to increase their botnet, botmasters could in the long run only
grow by compromising existing devices, potentially already under
the control of another botmaster. Indeed, we already observe this,
with infections rarely occurring on “fresh” devices and 88.5% of all
new infections on systems that have been exploited previously.
Evidently, botmasters do not want to share an infected device
with other botnets, so when a botnet infects a device, one of its
first actions is to kill processes such as telnet and ssh that can be
used to infect this device. While this ensures that the device cannot
be accessed after infection, once the infection is removed from the
device – typically after a reboot – it will be vulnerable again. Such
reinfections happen comparatively fast, the average duration to be
reinfected is 1 day and 9 hours, with a standard deviation of 4 days
and 7 hours. We determined the type of device based on daily IPv4
banner grabs from Shodan and Censys. Surprisingly, we see that
routers frequently reset in practice, and remain infected only on
average 12 hours (standard deviation 89 hours). Still, takeovers can
happen if the telnet port was not exposed to TCP port 23 but to
port 2323. While Mirai brute forces on both ports, it only eliminates
programs listening on port 23. These devices can hence be “stolen”
from other adversaries.
Figure 7a shows such takeover behavior for one example device.
The device is reset on multiple occasions, indicated by the red tri-
angles, but is almost immediately being reinfected. From the figure
we see that this particular device is mostly re-infected with the
same malware, but frequently another variant takes over. In the
time between reboot and reinfection, IoT devices are up for grabs.
Figure 8 shows the transition behavior between infections for all
devices after a reboot for four of the major variants encountered.
It shows that botnets do at a global scale lose some IoT devices to-
wards other major players, however in most cases the re-infections
happen with the same malware strain. This is made possible as
successful login attempts are reported to the C&C server, thus pro-
viding the botmaster with a list of good credentials and facilitating
easy reinfection. This feature was already part of the original Mirai.
As the reinfections by the same malware are so successful however,
it might be the case that botmasters actually use the alive pings
sent to the C&C server to monitor whether a device is still active
or has dropped off to infect the device again. By monitoring and
reinfecting devices in this manner, they could preempt another
botnet from taking over the device. While we do find indications
for this hypothesis given that the average time for a device to be
re-infected with the same malware is only 1.5 hours as opposed to
the average infection time of 1 day and 9 hours, it is impossible to
prove this conclusively by merely observing the ecosystem.
Figure 8 however also shows that a large portion of devices are
never infected again after cleanup, denoted by an edge going to
the “end” node. As it is unlikely for a device to not be invaded or
re-infected, the device is most likely secured by its owner. In total,
175k devices are infected by only one variant over the duration of
this study, whereas 28k devices were taken over at least once.
Without information about “infectable” devices, the only way
for botnets to locate victims is based on port scanning. As Mirai
performs scanning based on randomly-chosen candidate IPs, the
largest botnets should be most likely to find these restarted devices
to add them to their network, and would therefore need the least
time to find and infect a device that has just been cleaned up by
another malware. Figure 9 shows the probability density function
for different variants, and shows that the larger the variant, the
quicker it takes over a device. Size does matter: we find a strong
negative correlation between the original size of a botnet and the
time it takes to accumulate new devices and grow, that with a
Pearson coefficient of -0.501 (p < 0.01) is able to explain half of the
difference in infection behavior between strains.
6.1.2 Concurrent infections. To gain exclusivity over a device, the
Mirai malware shuts down all processes running on port 22, 23 and
80, and binds itself to these ports to prevent other processes from
doing so. While this is an effective way of keeping others out, it does
not fully eliminate the possibility of other bots attacking certain
devices. As telnet is a protocol that receives much unsolicited traffic
[18], network operators sometimes bind their telnet not to port
23, but to port 2323. The original Mirai takes this into account
