I'm trying to achieve both "allowJs" and "Compile On Save" at the same time.
"allowJs" exists in tsconfig.json, but not the IDE's TypeScript Build options.
"Compile On Save" exists in the IDE (which makes sense, since it is really an
editor concern), but is disabled if tsconfig.json is present. What I think
would be ideal is to allow "Compile On Save" to be lit up and active in the
IDE regardless of whether tsconfig is present or not, even if the other
options (which are passed through to to the compiler) are not available.
