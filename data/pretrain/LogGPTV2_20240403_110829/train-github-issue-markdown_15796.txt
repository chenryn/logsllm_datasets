RFC 6265[1] allows cookie values to be double-quoted[2]. However, the current
sanitization code strips the double quotes out of a double-quoted value (i.e.,
a value beginning with a double quote and ending with a double quote).
Ironically, the sanitization code double quotes a value if it begins or ends
with a space or comma. The RFC grammar specification allowing the surrounding
double quotes is also included in the comments of the sanitizeCookieValue()
function.
The inability to double-quote a cookie value is preventing me from duplicating
the behavior of a legacy Java system I am replacing.
There was some tangentially related conversation for #7243, but that
conversation did not address this issue specifically.
