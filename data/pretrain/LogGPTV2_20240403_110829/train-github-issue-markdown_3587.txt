##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible-playbook --version
    ansible-playbook 2.0.0.2
      config file = /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/XXX/workspace/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = modules/ansible
##### CONFIGURATION
Nothing special
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Linux
Replicable on Ubuntu and CentOS
##### SUMMARY
Following line works as expected
    when: job_status.json.status == 'FAILED' or job_status.json.status == 'PASSED'
Wrapping same code with inline array:
    when: job_status.json.status in ['FAILED','PASSED']
Triggers error:  
["FAILED"' failed. The error was: template error while templating string:
unexpected '}', expected ']'. String: {% if job_status.json.status in
["FAILED" %} True {% else %} False {% endif %}
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Syntax for 'in' operator should work in when statement with inline array
definition.  
Most probably inline array is interpreted differently, most probably can be
fixed by enforcing interpretation of [] when preceded by in operator.
