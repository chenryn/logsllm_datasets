User: How to do scalability testing? What is load balancing?
Assistant: How to do scalability testing? 1. Determine the test purpose: determine the system to be tested, set the test objectives and requirements. 2. Define the scenario: Simulate the usage situation of real users, including scenario factors such as the number of users, request type, and number of requests. 3. Design the test plan: define the test environment, test equipment, and test tools. 4. Execute the test: Execute the test according to the test plan, and collect test data, such as request volume, response time, throughput, error rate, etc. 5. Analyze test data: analyze test results to find limiting factors and bottlenecks. 6. Propose an optimization plan: combine the test results to propose a system optimization plan and implement it. What is load balancing? Load balancing is a technique for distributing workload across multiple computer resources, enabling the system to handle more requests and improving reliability and availability. By routing requests to multiple servers, load balancing can ensure that requests are allocated to different servers in the same proportion to ensure that the load of each server is relatively balanced. Load balancing is commonly used in networking to help distribute requests sent from one client to multiple servers.
