### Title: Black Hat US-18: Practical Web Cache Poisoning: Redefining 'Unexploitable'

Modern web applications are often a patchwork of caches and content delivery networks (CDNs). In this session, I will demonstrate how to compromise websites by leveraging esoteric web features to turn their caches into exploit delivery systems, targeting anyone who visits the homepage.

I will illustrate and develop this technique using vulnerabilities that have given me control over numerous well-known websites and frameworks. The presentation will progress from simple single-request attacks to intricate exploit chains. These chains can hijack JavaScript, pivot across cache layers, subvert social media, and misdirect cloud services, all in pursuit of the perfect exploit.

Unlike previous cache poisoning techniques, which relied on specific vulnerabilities like response splitting or cache-server quirks that could be easily patched, this approach exploits core principles of caching. As a result, it affects caching solutions indiscriminately. The implications extend beyond websites; I will show how this method allowed me to compromise Mozilla infrastructure and partially hijack a notorious Firefox feature, effectively turning tens of millions of Firefox browsers into a low-fat botnet under my control.

In addition to sharing a comprehensive detection methodology, I will release and open-source the Burp Suite Community extension that fueled this research. By the end of the session, you will have a new perspective on web exploitation and an appreciation for how simply placing a cache in front of a website can transform it from completely secure to critically vulnerable.
