### Static Source Translation Terminology

#### NAT Pool
- **Definition**: A pool of IP addresses used as inside global or outside local addresses in translations.
- **Configuration**:
  ```plaintext
  ip nat inside source static 10.0.0.19 192.0.2.1
  ip nat inside source static 10.0.1.47 192.0.2.2
  ```

#### Port Address Translation (PAT)
- **Definition**: An extension to NAT that translates information at Layer 4 and above, such as TCP and UDP port numbers.
- **Configuration**:
  ```plaintext
  ip nat outside source static 174.143.213.240 10.0.2.181
  ```
- **Dynamic PAT Configuration**:
  - Includes the `overload` keyword to allow multiple internal hosts to share a single external IP address.

#### Extendable Translation
- **Definition**: Used when multiple overlapping static translations are configured.
- **Configuration**:
  ```plaintext
  access-list 10 permit 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255
  ip nat pool MyPool 192.0.2.1 192.0.2.254 prefix-length 24
  ip nat inside source list 10 pool MyPool
  ```

#### Special NAT Pool Types
- **Rotary NAT Pool**: Used for load balancing.
- **Match-Host**: Preserves the host portion of the address after translation.
- **Configuration**:
  ```plaintext
  ip nat pool LoadBalServers 10.0.99.200 10.0.99.203 prefix-length 24 type rotary
  ip nat inside destination list 12 pool LoadBalServers
  ```

#### Troubleshooting and Tuning
- **Commands**:
  ```plaintext
  show ip nat translations [verbose]
  show ip nat statistics
  clear ip nat translations
  ```
- **Tuning Parameters**:
  ```plaintext
  ip nat translation tcp-timeout <seconds>
  ip nat translation udp-timeout <seconds>
  ip nat translation max-entries <number>
  ```

### Quality of Service (QoS) Models

#### IP Type of Service (TOS)
- **Best Effort**: No QoS policies are implemented.
- **Integrated Services (IntServ)**: Uses RSVP to reserve bandwidth per flow across all nodes in a path.
- **Differentiated Services (DiffServ)**: Classifies and marks packets individually; policy decisions are made independently by each node.

#### Layer 2 QoS Markings
- **Ethernet CoS**: 3-bit 802.1p field in 802.1Q header.
- **Frame Relay DE**: 1-bit drop eligibility flag.
- **ATM CLP**: 1-bit drop eligibility flag.
- **MPLS TC**: 3-bit field compatible with 802.1p.

#### IP QoS Markings
- **IP Precedence**: First three bits of the IP TOS field; limited to 8 traffic classes.
- **DSCP**: First six bits of the IP TOS field; provides more granular classification.

#### QoS Flowchart
- **Software Queue Scheduler**:
  - **Decision Queue Full?**
    - **Yes**: Drop packet (Tail Drop).
    - **No**: Process packet.
- **Congestion Avoidance**:
  - **Policing**: Imposes an artificial ceiling on bandwidth; traffic exceeding the rate is reclassified or dropped.
  - **Shaping**: Buffers excess traffic for delayed transmission; makes efficient use of bandwidth but introduces delay.
  - **RED/WRED/CBWRED**: Randomly drops packets before a queue is full to prevent tail drop; recognizes prioritized traffic based on marking.

### Queuing Comparison

- **FIFO**: Default on interfaces >2 Mbps.
- **Priority Queuing (PQ)**: Always empties higher-priority queues first.
- **Custom Queuing (CQ)**: Rotates through queues using Weighted Round Robin (WRR).
- **Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)**: Processes a configurable number of bytes from each queue per turn.
- **Class-Based WFQ (CBWFQ)**: Administratively configured queues with allocated bandwidth.
- **Low Latency Queuing (LLQ)**: CBWFQ with a policed strict-priority queue.

### Subnetting and CIDR

- **CIDR Notation**: Provides more granularity than classful addressing; expressed as /XX.
- **VLSM**: Variable-length subnet masks between 0 and 32 bits; used to define routes.
- **Subnet Proportions and Classful Ranges**:
  - **A**: 0.0.0.0 â€“ 127.255.255.255
  - **B**: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255
  - **C**: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255
  - **D**: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
  - **E**: 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255

### IPv6 Protocol Header

- **Address Notation**:
  - Eliminate leading zeros from two-byte sets.
  - Replace consecutive zeros with a double-colon (::).
- **Address Formats**:
  - **Global Unicast**: Global Prefix + Subnet + Interface ID.
  - **Link-local Unicast**: Always set to 6.
  - **Multicast**: Group ID.
- **EUI-64 Formation**:
  - Insert 0xfffe between the two halves of the MAC.
  - Flip the seventh bit (universal/local flag) to 1.

### Extension Headers
- **Hop-by-hop Options (0)**: Carries additional information examined by every router in the path.
- **Routing (43)**: Used for specific routing purposes.
