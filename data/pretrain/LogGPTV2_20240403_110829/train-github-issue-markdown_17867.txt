When sending form data, values which are booleans are encoded as "True" and
"False" as opposed to "true" and "false". This is because of the
urllib.parse.urlencode function.  
Perhaps it is non standard to pass a boolean as form data, but I think this is
non obvious to regular users. Maybe it should raise an exception or perform a
conversion to lowercase.
## Expected Result
    >>> data = {"key": True, "key2": "true"}
    >>> req = requests.post("http://www.google.com", data=data)
    >>> req.request.body
    'key=true&key2=true'
## Actual Result
    >>> data = {"key": True, "key2": "true"}
    >>> req = requests.post("http://www.google.com", data=data)
    >>> req.request.body
    'key=True&key2=true'
## Reproduction Steps
Pass a dictionary with a key/value pair with a boolean value to the data param
of a post.
