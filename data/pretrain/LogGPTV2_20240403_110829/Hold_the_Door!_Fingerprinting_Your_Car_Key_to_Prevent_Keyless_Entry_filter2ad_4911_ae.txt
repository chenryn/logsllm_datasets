did not yield an FPR of 0% with an FNR of 0% on the RKE
system during experimentation, we conclude that the achieved
results are acceptable, as HODOR is designed to act as a support
to an existing authentication method in a keyless entry systems.
G. Effects of Temperature Variation
Analog signals are easily affected by external factors. In
particular, temperature variation is one of the most critical
concerns in device ﬁngerprinting [29], [46], [53]. In order to
show that HODOR properly operates under varying tempera-
tures, UHF-band RF signals were sampled in an ice box with
dry ice to maintain a certain temperature as shown in Fig.
15a. It should be noted that this setup was only available
indoors. Owing to this, evaluation on the PKES system was
impossible, as it must occur within the vicinity of a vehicle
(i.e., outdoors). The UHF-band RF signals for training were
measured in degrees, between 20°C to -20°C in intervals of
10°C. Fig. 15b shows output distributions of the k-NN and
SVM algorithms as a function of temperature. Unlike an attack
detection, UHF-band RF signals measured in terms of varying
temperature should be recognized as legitimate. Accordingly,
this also means that the output of the RKE system classiﬁer
should remain below a given threshold. In Fig. 15b, the output
distribution at 0°C and -20°C exceeds the threshold. This is

F. Attack Detection in RKE Systems
We further analyzed the UHF-band attack signal against
the RKE system of the Soul. Cryptographic attacks on RKE
systems have been extensively studied in the past decade [22],
[40], [45], [47], [61]. An adversary eavesdrops on several
valid packets and exploits the weaknesses of the cryptographic
algorithm to extract the secret key. It is also possible for
an adversary to attempt to playback the sampled UHF-band
signal. One example of a playback attack on an RKE system
is a roll-jam attack [11]. In this attack, the adversary interferes
(i.e., jams) some frequencies and plays back valid encrypted
messages.
To simulate a cryptographic attack, one remote key fob
out of three used in the experiment was chosen as legitimate.
The remaining two remote key fobs and two SDR devices
were used to simulate malicious UHF-band RF packets. In the
case of a playback attack, two SDR devices were employed
to simulate attack signals. Moreover, we tested the UHF-
band RF signals that were sampled at different distances from
where they had been sampled during training. Even though
the classiﬁer was trained with a training set measured at a
distance of one meter, the legitimate remote key fob must still
be identiﬁed correctly within the communication range of the
RKE system. Therefore, we measured the UHF-band signals
from the legitimate key fob at a distance of 40 meters from
the RF signal receiver under LoS conditions and used this for
the test. Since SN RdB and Kurtosis are highly correlated
to the distance between the key fob and receiver, they were
excluded in this experiment. In other words, a classiﬁer using a
different feature set (i.e., fpeak and SpectralBrightness) was
employed for the training. We denote the RKE system classiﬁer
as CRKE. As we mentioned in Section II-A, an identical
packet was transmitted from a smart key multiple times for
reliable communication. Accordingly, HODOR veriﬁes a newly
received signal as an attack when the number of detected
(cid:5) among the N received preambles.
Therefore, the maximum value of N in our experiment is ﬁve.
In addition, we set the threshold(ΓRKE) of k-NN and SVM
algorithms to 4.5 and 5, respectively. Tables V and VI show
the mean and standard deviation of output distribution for both
the cryptographic and playback attacks. Even though HODOR
preambles exceeds (cid:4) N

not only because of the temperature variation, but also the
severe multipath environment caused by the limited space of
the ice box. However, as we denoted in Section V-F, an RKE
packet is considered an attack only if the number of detected
(cid:5) among the N received preambles.
Therefore, HODOR can achieve moderate FPR under temper-
ature variation. The k-NN and SVM algorithms output an
FPR of 6.36% and 0.65% at the same threshold determined
in Section V-F. Thus, we conclude that
the features used
in HODOR are operationally robust regardless of temperature
variation.
H. Battery Aging
A coin cell battery supplies stable DC voltage to the key
fob. However, as the driver uses the key fob, the supplied
voltage decreases and may lead to feature variation. For
this reason, we further evaluated feature robustness against
battery aging. In the case of the Panasonic CR2032 lithium
battery, which we selected for our evaluation, the initial voltage
was 3V, but decreased to 2.5V over time [5]. This voltage
interval occupies around 97.34% of the battery duration time.
If the voltage drops under 2.5V, the key fob does not operate
properly due to insufﬁcient voltage supply. Therefore, using
the classiﬁer which had been trained in advance, we tested
the UHF-band signals at a speciﬁc voltage level between 2.5V
and 3V. Fig. 16 shows the output distribution of the k-NN and
SVM algorithms as a function of voltage level. Similar to the
temperature variation experiment, output of the classiﬁer for
the RKE system should be below a given threshold. The k-
NN and SVM algorithms both output an FPR of 0% at the
same threshold determined in Section V-F. Thus, we conclude
that the features used in HODOR are operationally regardless
of battery aging.

I. Execution Time
We implemented the functions that principally contribute to
the total execution time of HODOR. We selected the Raspberry-
pi 3B single-board computer [56] as a reference hardware
platform. This platform is based on a quad core 1.4GHz
Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) with 1GB RAM. Table VII shows the
execution time for each basic function used in HODOR, which
were implemented via Python programming. The classiﬁers
should be trained and cross-validated in advance. Owing to
this, the time for these two processes can be disregarded when
it comes to the operation time for verifying a door unlock
request. The results show that the k-NN algorithm takes longer
to detect attacks. As a result, the total operation time for the
veriﬁcation of the PKES system using FSK modulation is
163.8ms and 159.038ms in the k-NN and SVM algorithms,
respectively. These are the sum of feature extraction and attack
detection processes. In addition, the RKE system using FSK
modulation requires 12.8ms and 9.04ms in the k-NN and
SVM algorithms, respectively. In ASK modulation, the total
amount of operation time for the veriﬁcation of the PKES
system using ASK modulation is 126.27ms and 121.37ms
in the k-NN and SVM algorithms, respectively. In addition,
the RKE system using ASK modulation requires 15.13ms
and 11.2ms in the k-NN and SVM algorithms, respectively.
For the feature extraction phase, similar execution times were
obtained because the numbers of samples for both ASK &
FSK modulations were similar to each other. In other words,
the duration of the preamble region from which the features
are extracted is similar regardless of the modulation schemes.
Regarding the NPC and Attack Detection phases, HODOR has

c
different execution times that correspond to the modulation
schemes. In HODOR, the number of used features are differ-
ent depending on modulation schemes. Because HODOR uses
, for ASK-modulated signals,
one additional feature, f of f set
attack detection time for ASK modulation is longer than FSK
modulation. However, since the ASK-modulated signal has a
much shorter execution time for feature extraction, the total
execution time of the ASK-modulated signal is shorter than the
FKS-modulated signal. According to [7], humans cannot easily
recognize a delay of less than 500ms. Thus, it is expected that
HODOR would be effective as a support mechanism to existing
keyless entry systems without creating a noticeable delay on
the user end.
J. Feature Importance
We minimized the feature set through the exhaustive search
in Section IV. In this subsection, we further evaluated the
feature importance as a function of each attack scenario. We
employed the Relief algorithm, which is a unique family of
ﬁlter-style feature-selection algorithms [50]. A key idea of the
Relief algorithm is to estimate the quality of features according
to how well their values distinguish between instances near
to each other. Based on the MATLAB implementation of the
relieff function, we ranked the features in each attack
detection experiment. Table VIII shows the rankings of the
features as a function of each attack scenario. The distribution
of the top two features in each attack scenario are represented
in Fig. 17. In a single-band relay and ampliﬁcation attack,
SN RdB and kurtosis are effective features to detect an attack.
In an ampliﬁcation attack, even when the adversaries adjust
the SNR level to the legitimate signal, HODOR can effectively
differentiate the attack signals using the kurtosis feature. In a
digital relay attack, fpeak has a major role. This is because
of the clock difference between the key fob and the SDRs
(i.e., USRP and HackRF). Though not as effective as fpeak,
kurtosis is also useful to detect a digital relay attack. In a play-
back attack, due to the quantization error, spectral brightness
and kurtosis are both effective features to differentiate attack
signals.
K. Advanced Dual-Band Relay Attacks
In this subsection, we assumed the presence of an
advanced dual-band relay attack adversary, extending the
