In the `package.json` file, tooltips that provide additional information about npm packages upon mouse hover do not function correctly when the package name is namespaced. For instance, hovering over `@cycle/core` does not display any information, whereas hovering over `express` shows the package description and the latest version number. I am currently using version 0.10.6.
