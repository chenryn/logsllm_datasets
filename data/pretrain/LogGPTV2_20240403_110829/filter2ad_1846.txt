## Abstract
We designed and constructed a 24×24-port optical circuit switch (OCS) prototype with a programming time of 68.5 µs, a switching time of 2.8 µs, and a receiver electronics initialization time of 8.7 µs [1]. This prototype was tested in a data center environment under various workloads to demonstrate its performance.

## 1. Introduction
Data center networks are essential for the scalability and performance of data center applications but are often under-provisioned due to high capital and operational expenses (CAPEX and OPEX) [2]. Recent research has combined traditional electronic packet switches (EPS) with optical circuit switches (OCS) [3]–[5] to reduce costs. However, the relatively slow OCS switching times of 12 ms limit their applicability to specific workloads such as rack-to-rack backup or virtual machine migration. We designed and constructed a 24×24-port OCS prototype, named Mordia, to support more common all-to-all communication patterns, such as those found in MapReduce and online webpage rendering using distributed memory caches.

## 2. Design & Implementation
The prototype is divided into a data plane (Figure 1) and a control plane (Figure 2).

### Data Plane
The data plane is structured as an optical ring with six stations. Each station contains the necessary optical components to switch four input/output port pairs. We use fixed-wavelength laser transmitters and tunable wavelength-selective switch (WSS)-based receivers.

### Control Plane
The control plane is responsible for programming the WSS modules and synchronizing with all devices connected to the OCS. The controller maintains a round-robin schedule of input-output port mappings. Every 80 µs, the controller programs the six WSS modules with the next input-output port mapping in the list. This round-robin schedule enables the OCS to support all-to-all communication patterns at high speeds, providing throughput and latency fairness.

Before and after reconfiguring the WSS modules, the controller broadcasts a synchronization packet to connected devices. This allows the devices to learn the current input-output port mapping and determine when it is safe to begin transmitting.

## 3. Measurements
Figure 4 shows physical measurements of the OCS. The mirrors are only in motion for a small fraction of the total time, with the majority of the loss-of-light time due to ringing (T3). Table 1 compares the switching speed of the Mordia prototype to Helios [3, 6]. Figure 5 illustrates the loss-of-light time (T2 + T3) as seen from the connected devices, resulting in a minimum duty cycle of approximately 85%.

## 4. Workloads
The demonstration includes various workloads on a 24-node compute cluster, with real-time visualization of communication patterns. Each workload can be run on either a traditional EPS or the Mordia OCS to compare performance directly.

### Example Workloads
- **UDP Blaster:** A synthetic traffic generator where each host sends constant bitrate UDP traffic to every other host in the cluster. Good performance requires synchronization between the connected devices and the Mordia OCS.
- **TritonSort:** The world's fastest large data sorting system [7], which also exhibits an all-to-all communication pattern. TritonSort uses TCP and is rate-limited by disk I/O bandwidth. Successful operation of TritonSort on the Mordia OCS demonstrates its capability to handle complex, high-throughput workloads.
