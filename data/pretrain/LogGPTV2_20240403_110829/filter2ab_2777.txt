**ATT&CK ID:** G1013  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Metador

Metador has been observed using the Windows command line to execute various commands. [216]

In this revised version, I have:

1. Clearly separated the ATT&CK ID and Technique Name for better readability.
2. Reworded the sentence to be more precise and professional, indicating that Metador has been "observed" using the command line, which is a common way to describe such activities in cybersecurity reports.
