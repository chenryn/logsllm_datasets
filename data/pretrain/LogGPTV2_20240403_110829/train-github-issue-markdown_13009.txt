In this code:
    fn foo() {
      match Some(x) {
          Some(y) { fail!(); }
          None    { fail!(); }
    }
    fn bar() {
        let mut i = 0;
        while (i '
    src/test/compile-fail/bad.rs:12 fn main() {}
                                                                       ^
It would be much more helpful to report the error at the location where the
un-closed brace was (in this case, after the alt in `foo`). I don't know how
easy it would be to do with the current parser, though.
