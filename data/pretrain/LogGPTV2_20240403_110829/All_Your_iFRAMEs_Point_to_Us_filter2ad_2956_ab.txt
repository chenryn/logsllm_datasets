### 4. Prevalence of Drive-by Downloads

We provide an estimate of the prevalence of web-based malware based on data collected over a ten-month period (January 2007 to October 2007). During this time, we subjected over 10 million URLs to in-depth processing through our verification system. Overall, we detected more than 3 million malicious URLs hosted on more than 180,000 landing sites. We observed more than 9,000 different distribution sites. These findings are summarized in Table 1. While these results highlight the scale of the problem, they do not necessarily reflect the exposure of end-users to drive-by downloads. In the following sections, we attempt to address this question by estimating the overall impact of malicious websites.

| Data Collection Period | Total URLs Checked in-Depth | Unique Suspicious Landing URLs | Unique Malicious Landing URLs | Unique Malicious Landing Sites | Unique Distribution Sites |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Jan - Oct 2007         | 66,534,330                   | 3,385,889                       | 3,417,590                       | 181,699                         | 9,340                     |

**Table 1: Summary of Collected Data**

To study the potential impact of malicious websites on end-users, we first examined the fraction of incoming search queries to Google's search engine that returned at least one URL labeled as malicious in the results page. Figure 1 provides a running average of this fraction. The graph shows an increasing trend, with an average approaching 1.3% of the overall incoming search queries. This finding is concerning, as it indicates that a significant fraction of search queries return results that may expose end-users to exploitation attempts.

![Figure 1: Percentage of search queries resulting in at least one URL labeled as malicious; 7-day running average](figure_1.png)

To further understand the significance of this finding, we inspected the prevalence of malicious sites among the top one million URLs appearing in Google search results. Approximately 6,000 of these URLs belong to sites that have been verified as malicious at some point during our data collection. Upon closer inspection, we found that these sites appear uniformly distributed across the top million websites, with the most popular landing page having a rank of 1,588. These results further highlight the severity of the web malware threat, as about 0.6% of the top million URLs that appeared most frequently in Google's search results led to exposure to malicious activity at some point.

An additional interesting result is the geographic locality of web-based malware. Table 2 shows the geographic breakdown of IP addresses of the top malware distribution sites and landing sites. The results indicate that a significant number of Chinese-based sites contribute to the drive-by problem. Overall, 67% of the malware distribution sites and 64.6% of the landing sites are hosted in China. These findings provide more evidence of poor security practices by website administrators, such as running outdated and unpatched versions of web server software.

| Hosting Country | % of All Distribution Sites | % of All Landing Sites |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| China           | 67.0%                       | 64.6%                  |
| United States   | 13.0%                       | 13.5%                  |
| Russia          | 3.0%                        | 3.5%                   |
| Malaysia        | 3.5%                        | 3.0%                   |
| Korea           | 3.0%                        | 3.0%                   |
| Germany         | 3.0%                        | 3.0%                   |

**Table 2: Top 5 Hosting Countries**

Upon closer inspection of the geographic locality of the web-malware distribution networks as a whole (i.e., the correlation between the location of a distribution site and the landing sites pointing to it), we found that the malware distribution networks are highly localized within common geographical boundaries. This localization varies across different countries and is most evident in China, where 96% of the landing sites in China point to malware distribution servers hosted in that country.

#### 4.1. Impact of Browsing Habits

To examine the impact of users' browsing habits on their exposure to exploitation via drive-by downloads, we measured the prevalence of malicious websites across different website functional categories based on the DMOZ classification [1]. Using a large random sample of about 7.2 million URLs, we first mapped each URL to its corresponding DMOZ category. We were able to find the corresponding DMOZ categories for about 50% of these URLs. We then inspected each URL through our in-depth verification system and measured the percentage of malicious URLs in each functional category. Figure 2 shows the prevalence of detected malicious and suspicious websites in each top-level DMOZ category.

![Figure 2: Prevalence of suspicious and malicious pages](figure_2.png)

As the graph illustrates, website categories associated with "gray content" (e.g., adult websites) show a stronger connection to malicious content. For instance, about 0.5% of the URLs in the Adult category exhibited drive-by download activity upon visiting these websites. These results suggest that users who browse such websites will likely be more exposed to exploitation compared to users who browse websites from other functional categories. However, an important observation from the same figure is that the distribution of malicious websites is not significantly skewed toward pages that serve gray content. In fact, the distribution shows that malicious websites are generally present in all website categories we observed. Overall, these results show that while "safe browsing" habits may limit users' exposure to drive-by downloads, they do not provide an effective safeguard against exploitation.

### 5. Malicious Content Injection

In Section 4, we showed that exposure to web-malware is not strongly tied to a particular browsing habit. Our assertion is that this is due, in part, to the fact that drive-by downloads are triggered by visiting staging sites that are not necessarily of malicious intent but have content that lures the visitor into the malware distribution network.

In this section, we validate this conjecture by studying the properties of the websites that participate in the malware delivery trees. As discussed in Section 4, attackers use a number of techniques to control the content of benign websites and turn them into nodes in the malware distribution networks. These techniques can be divided into two categories: web server compromise and third-party contributed content (e.g., blog posts). Unfortunately, it is generally difficult to determine the exact contribution of either category. In some cases, even manual inspection of the content of each website may not lead to conclusive evidence regarding the manner in which the malicious content was injected into the website.

Therefore, in this section, we provide insights into some features of these websites that may explain their presence in the malware delivery trees. We focus on the features that we can determine in an automated fashion. Specifically, where possible, we first inspect the version of the software running on the web server for each landing site. Additionally, we explore one important angle that we discovered, which contributes significantly to the distribution of web malwareâ€”namely, drive-by downloads via advertisements.
