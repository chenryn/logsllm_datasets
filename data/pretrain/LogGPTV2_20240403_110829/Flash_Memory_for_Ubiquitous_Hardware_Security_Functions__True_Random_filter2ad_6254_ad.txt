Figure 8. NIST test suite results for bits with RTN and thermal noise. 
Figure 8 shows one test result for the even-odd scheme, 
which  only  used  an  LSB  from  the  up-time  and down-time, 
when  bits  with  both  RTN  and  thermal  noise  are  used.  10 
sequences  generated  from  multiple bits  are tested  and  each 
sequence  consists  of  600,000  bits.  Note  that  some  of  the 
results  are  not  shown  here  due  to  the  space  constraint.  
NonOverlappingTemplate,  RandomExcursions 
and 
RandomExcursionsVariant  have  a  lot  of  tests.  In  the 
40
result above, the proportion in the second column shows the 
proportion  of  the  sequences  which  passed  the  test.  If  the 
proportion  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  threshold  value 
specified at the bottom of the figure (8 out of 10 or 4 out of 
5),  then  the  data  is  considered  random.  The  P-value  in  the 
first  column  indicates  the  uniformity  of  the  P-values 
calculated in each test. If P-value is greater than or equal to 
0.0001,  the  sequences  can  be  considered  to  be  uniformly 
distributed  [2]. The  result indicates  that the proposed  RNG 
passes all the NIST tests.  
We also tested random numbers from one bit with only 
RTN behavior, using multiple bits from up-time and down-
time.  In  this  case,  we  generated  ten  200,000-bit  sequences 
from one bit. The data passed all NIST tests with results that 
are similar to the above case. For the Universal test, which 
requires  a  sequence  longer than  387,840  bits,  we  used  five 
500,000-bit sequences.  
2)  Performance 
The throughput of the proposed RNG varies significantly 
depending on the switching rate of individual bits, sampling 
speed  and  environment  conditions.  Typically,  only  a  small 
fraction  of  bits  show  pure  RTN  behavior  with  minimal 
thermal  noise.  TABLE  III  shows  the  performance  of  Flash 
chips  from  four  manufacturers.  The  average  throughput 
ranges from 848 bits/second to 3.37 Kbits/second. Note that 
the fastest switching trap that can be identified is limited by 
the reading speed in our experiments.

If  bits  with  both  RTN  and  thermal  noise  are  also  used, 
the  percentage  of  bits  which  can  be  used  for  RNG  can  be 
much  higher. The performance of  these  bits  from  the  same 
Flash chips as in the pure RTN case is shown in TABLE IV. 
The average throughputs are higher because thermal noise is 
high frequency noise.

In our tests, the RNG throughput is largely limited by the 
timing of the asynchronous interface which is controlled by 
an ARM microcontroller with CPU frequency of 60MHz and 
the  8-bit  bus  for  a  Flash  chip.  We  believe  that  the  RNG

performance  can  be  much  higher  if data  can  be  transferred 
more  quickly  through  the  interface.  As  an  example,  the 
average for RTN transition time is reported to range from 1 
microsecond to 10 seconds [11]. If a 128 bytes can be read in 
6 microseconds which is the ideal random cache read speed 
for  the  Micron  SLC  chips,  a  RTN  bit  with  0.1ms  average 
transition  time  will  give  approximately  20  Kbits/second 
throughput. Note that one page could have multiple RTN bits 
and  our  algorithm  allows  using  multiple  bits  in  parallel  so 
that  the  aggregated  throughput  of  an  RNG  can  be  much 
higher.  For  example,  if  N  bits  can  be  read  at  a  time,  in 
theory, that can increase the throughput by a factor of N.  
3)  Temperature Variations  
For traditional hardware RNGs, low temperatures present 
a  particular  challenge  because  thermal  noise,  which  they 
typically  rely  on,  can  be  reduced  with  the  temperature.  To 
study  the  effectiveness  of  the  Flash-based  RNG  in  low 
temperatures, we tested the scheme at two low temperature 
settings: one in a freezer, which is about -5°C, and the other 
in  dry  ice,  which  is  about  -80°C.  The  generated  random 
sequences  are  tested  individually  as  well  as  combined 
together  with  data  from  experiments  at  room  temperature. 
All  of  them  passed  the  NIST  test  suite  without  a  problem, 
showing that our technique is effective at low temperatures. 
Note that the experiments for temperature variations and 
aging  are  performed  with  a  setup  where  data  from  Flash 
memory  are  transferred  from  a  testbed  to  a  PC  through  an 
USB interface. The post processing is performed on the PC. 
The USB interface limits the Flash read speed to 6.67KHz. 
As a result, the throughput in this setup is noticeably slower 
than  the  results  in  previous  subsections  where  the  entire 
RNG operation is performed on a microcontroller.   
To  understand  the  impact  of  temperature  variations  on 
the  Flash-based  RNG,  we  tested  the  first  80  bits  of  a  page 
from a Numonyx chip. At room temperature, 62 bits out of 
the  80  bits  showed  oscillations  between  the  programmed 
state and erased state. 14 bits out of the 62 bits were selected 
by  the  selection  algorithm,  which  identifies  bits  with  pure 
RTN or both RTN and thermal components. The throughputs 
of the 14 bits are shown in Figure 9.  
Figure  10  and  Figure  11  show  the  performance  of  the 
RNG at -5 °C and -80 °C, respectively. At -5 °C, 79 bits out 
of 80 bits showed noisy behavior and 20 out of 79 bits were 
selected by the RNG algorithm as ones with RTN. At -80 °C, 
72 bits out of 80 bits showed noise and 28 out of 72 bits were 
selected as  the ones  with  RTN.  On average,  we  found  that 
per-bit throughput is slightly decreased at low temperatures, 
most  likely  because  of  reduced  thermal  noise  and  possibly 
because of slowed RTN switching. However, the difference 
is not significant. In fact, a previous study [12] claimed that

Interestingly,  we  found  that  the  number  of  bits  that  are 
selected  by  our  algorithm  as  ones  with  RTN  behavior 
increases  at  a  low  temperature.  This  trend  is  likely  to  be 
because

4)  Aging 
Flash devices wear-out over time as more program/erase 
(P/E)  operations  are  performed.  A  typical  SLC  Flash  chip 
has  a  lifetime  of  1  million  P/E  cycles.  In  the  context  of 
RNGs,  however,  we  do  not  think  that  wear-outs  cause 
concerns.  In  fact,  aging  can  create  new  RTN  traps  and 
increase the number of bits with RTN. To check the impact 
of aging on the RNG, we tested the scheme after 1,000 P/E 
operations  and  10,000  P/E  operations  as  shown  in  TABLE 
V. The RNG outputs passed the NIST test suite in both cases 
and did not show any degradation in performance.

The table shows an interesting trend that more bits show 
RTN behavior after 10,000 P/E cycles. The increase in noisy 
bits  can  potentially  increase  the  overall  RNG  throughput. 
One possible concern with aging is a decrease in “stable time 
period” during which each bit shows noisy behavior. In our

experiments,  we  found  that  a  bit  can  be  used  for  random 
number generation for over 12 hours after one programming 
(Algorithm III). If a bit is completely worn out, charge can 
leak  out  more  quickly,  requiring  more  frequent  calibration. 
However,  given  that  Flash  memory  is  designed  to  have  a 
retention  time  of  10  years  within  its  lifetime,  we  do  not 
expect the  leakage  to be  a  significant problem. We  plan  to 
perform larger scale experiments to understand how often a 
bit  needs to be re-programmed  for reliable  random  number 
generation. In practice, a check can also be added to ensure 
that a bit oscillates between 1 and 0.  
C.  Fingerprints 
For  fingerprinting,  we  are  interested  in  uniqueness  and 
robustness of fingerprints. The fingerprint should be unique, 
which  means  that  fingerprints  from  different  chips  or 
different  locations  of  the  same  chip  must  be  significantly 
different  –  the  correlation  coefficient  should  be  low.  The 
fingerprint should also be robust, in a sense that fingerprints 
from  a  given  location  of  a  chip  must  stay  stable  over  time 
and  even  under  different  environmental  conditions  –  the 
correlation coefficient should be high. 
In  the  experiments  detailed  below,  we  used  24  chips 
(Micron  34nm  SLC),  and  24  pages  (6  pages  in  4  blocks) 
from  each  chip.  10  measurements  were  made  from  each 
page. Each page has 16,384 bits. 
1)  Uniqueness 
To  test  uniqueness,  we  compared  the  fingerprint  of  a 
page to the fingerprints of the same page on different chips, 
and recorded their correlation coefficients. A total of 66,240 
pairs were compared – (24 chips choose 2) * 24 pages * 10 
measurements.  The  results  are  shown  in  Figure  12.  The 
correlation  coefficients  are  very  low,  with  an  average  of 
0.0076. A Gaussian distribution fits the data well, as shown 
in red. 
the  generation  of  many 
fingerprinting  scheme  allows 
independent  fingerprints  from  a  single  chip.  The  average 
correlation coefficient in this case is 0.0072.

2)  Robustness 
To 
robustness,  we  compared  each  page’s 
measurement to the 9 other measurements of the same page’s 
fingerprint  (an  intra-chip  measurement).  The  histogram  of 
results for all pages is shown in Figure 14. The correlation 
coefficient for fingerprints from the same page is very high, 
with  an  average  of  0.9673.  The  minimum  observed
