**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Just a fix idea, but it would be cool to have model binding inside of the css
styles similar to the model bindings in html templates. This would make things
like theming at runtime a lot easier.
Something like this:
.button {  
background-color: {{myColorPropertyInMyCompontent}}  
}
