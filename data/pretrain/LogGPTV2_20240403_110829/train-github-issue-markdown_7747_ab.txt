### Issue Description

We are experiencing an issue with a custom Docker garbage collection script, as the built-in cleanup services are not functioning as expected. The error message `Job kubelet.service/start failed with result 'dependency'` indicates a dependency failure for the Docker service. To further investigate, I checked the Docker service logs using the following command:

```sh
$ journalctl -u docker
```

### Flannel Service Logs

To determine if the issue is related to the Flannel service, I also checked the Flannel logs using the following command:

```sh
$ journalctl -u flanneld
```

### Analysis and Next Steps

The Docker service logs indicate that there were multiple errors while unmounting containers, which may be causing the dependency failure. The Flannel logs do not show any critical errors, but they do show repeated "Ignoring not a miss" messages, which might be worth investigating further.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Investigate the Custom Garbage Collection Script:**
   - Review the script to ensure it is not causing issues with the Docker service.
   - Consider reverting to the built-in cleanup services or fixing the custom script.

2. **Check for Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies required by the Docker service are correctly configured and running.

3. **Review Container Unmounting Errors:**
   - Investigate why the containers are failing to unmount and address any underlying issues.

4. **Monitor Flannel:**
   - Continue to monitor the Flannel logs for any changes or new errors.

By addressing these points, we should be able to resolve the dependency failure and ensure the Docker service runs smoothly.
