**ATT&CK Technique Name: System Firmware**

In modern devices, system firmware is typically designed with an update feature. In contrast, older devices may have firmware that is factory-installed and requires specialized reprogramming equipment for updates. The firmware update feature allows vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. These updates are often delegated to the end-user and can be performed using a software update package. Additionally, it may be possible to conduct these updates over a network.
