Dealing with complexity 
• “Know who you’re selling to” 
• Build a community where we can reach others… 
• … and understand what others do. 
• “Transportation” 
• Build the right tools for the job. Let automation do the 
hard work, humans the smart work. 
• “Lingua franca” 
• Develop standards to work together better. 
Dealing with complexity 
• You make partners before you need them 
• Connect with industry groups and competitors 
• Participate and share information 
• Know which technologies you know, and which you don’t 
• Do you have or partner with reverse engineers? 
• When something is the right thing to do, do it 
• Track and participate in standards 
• We all should have done this with BCP38  
• Researchers help protect your organization 
• Cherish and encourage their work
