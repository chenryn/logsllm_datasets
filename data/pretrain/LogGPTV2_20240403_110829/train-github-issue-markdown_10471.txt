# Description of the new feature/enhancement
It would be helpful to be able to duplicate an open tab.
**Use Case:**  
I am going into a repo that has two npm scripts, one to run the frontend and
one to run the backend. So I run `npm run frontend`, great my frontend server
is running. Now I want to go into the same folder on a second terminal window
and run the other command `npm run backend`.
Right now I would need to open a new window and manually navigate to the
window. It would be very convenient to either right-click in the terminal or
on the terminal-tab and have a "duplicate tab" option which opens a new tab in
the same folder as the duplicated tab.
