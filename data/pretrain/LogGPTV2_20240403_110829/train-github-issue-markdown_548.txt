Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

**Code Example: Login**

**Error:**
```
Uncaught (in promise): No provider for ControlContainer! (NgControlName -> ControlContainer)
```

When I use the following code:
```html
[ngClass]="{'has-error': !username.valid}"
```
or
```html
[ngClass] [class.has-error]="!username.valid"
```
it works as expected. However, the documentation does not mention any requirement for using `ngClass` in this context.

This version is more structured and clearly presents the problem and the solutions you found.
