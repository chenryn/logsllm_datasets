It would be beneficial to implement a `kubectl stats podName` command that functions similarly to `docker stats`. Specifically, this command should provide a real-time, top-like interface on the client side, which connects to an endpoint and streams data every second. Given that the kubelet server already supports requests for `/stats/ns/podname/uid/containername`, implementing this feature should be relatively straightforward.

Furthermore, it would be even more advantageous to extend this functionality to display statistics for services, replication controllers (RCs), and other resources across the entire cluster. This would provide a comprehensive view of resource consumption and performance, enhancing the overall monitoring capabilities of Kubernetes.
