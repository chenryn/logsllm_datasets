Would be nice to have `kubectl stats podName` work like docker stats
(basically a top like interface on the client that connects to an endpoint
streaming data every second). I think this should be pretty straightforward,
since the kubelet server already supports requests for
`/stats/ns/podname/uid/containername`
Would be even better to have kubectl show stats consumed by a service, rc
across the cluster.
