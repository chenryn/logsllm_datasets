Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of the worker environment and the mod_jk child workerEnv in error state 6. It also shows the jk2_init() finding children in scoreboard slots 9, 6, 7, 10, and 12. Finally, it shows an error with a client trying to access a directory index that is forbidden by rule.
