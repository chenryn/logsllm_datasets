We implement our AKE protocol by using the NTL library compiled with the option NTL GMP LIP=on (i.e., 
building NTL using the GNU Multi-Precision package). The implementations are written in C++ without any parallel 
computations or multi-threads programming techniques. The program is run on a Dell Optiplex 780 computer with 
Ubuntu 12.04 TLS 64-bit system, equipped with a 2.83GHz Intel Core 2 Quad CPU and 3.8GB RAM. We use a 
n-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for the multiplications of two ring elements [19,51]. We use the CDT 
algorithm [58] as a tool for hashing to DZn,γ  and sampling from DZn,α, but use the DDLL algorithm [29] for sampling 
from DZn,β  (because the CDT algorithm has to store large precomputed values for a big β). In Table 3, we present the 
timings of each operation, and the ﬁgures represent the averaged timing (in millisecond, ms) for 1000 executions. Since 
our protocols also allow some kind of precomputations such as sampling Gaussian distributions ofﬂine, the timings 
can be greatly reduced if one consider it in practice. Finally, we note that our implementation has not undergone any 
real optimization, and it can much improved in practice.

techniques for Ring-LWE cryptography in [53] to give a tighter choice of parameters for desired security levels.
