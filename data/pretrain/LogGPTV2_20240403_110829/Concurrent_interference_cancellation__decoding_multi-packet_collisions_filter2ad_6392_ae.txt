### Network Performance Analysis

From Figure 28, it is evident that CIC significantly outperforms FTrack (by a factor of 4), standard LoRa (by a factor of 5), and Choir. Specifically, CIC can decode 45 packets per second (Pkts/sec), which is twice the maximum possible throughput for any single node (22 Pkts/sec) when the aggregate network traffic is 100 Pkts/sec. In comparison, standard LoRa achieves a maximum throughput of approximately 8 Pkts/sec, which is roughly one-third of the 22 Pkts/sec maximum. FTrack outperforms standard LoRa, achieving about 12 Pkts/sec when the aggregate rate is 50 Pkts/sec (25% of the offered load). However, at higher aggregate network rates, FTrack's performance degrades due to increased collisions, leading to a higher chance of overlapping packets. This results in FTrack's inability to distinguish between corresponding frequency tracks due to its poor frequency resolution.

#### Deployment Scenarios

**D1: High SNR, Line-of-Sight (LoS)**  
In this scenario, CIC significantly outperforms FTrack, standard LoRa, and Choir by a factor of 4. CIC can decode up to 45 Pkts/sec, which is slightly less than in the high SNR, LoS scenario. Standard LoRa maintains consistent performance, similar to the high SNR scenario, as it successfully captures higher SNR packets during collisions. FTrack, however, fails to detect low SNR packets, especially in the presence of stronger transmitters, leading to a degradation in performance in low SNR scenarios.

**D2: High SNR, Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS)**  
CIC continues to outperform FTrack, standard LoRa, and Choir by a factor of 4. CIC can receive about 40 Pkts/sec, slightly less than in the high SNR, LoS scenario. Standard LoRa's performance remains consistent, capturing higher SNR packets during collisions. FTrack's performance degrades in low SNR conditions, as it struggles to detect packets with low SNR, particularly in the presence of stronger transmitters.

**D3: Low SNR, NLoS**  
In this scenario, CIC significantly outperforms FTrack, standard LoRa, and Choir by a factor of 4. CIC can decode about 40 Pkts/sec, which is slightly lower than in the high SNR, LoS scenario. Standard LoRa's performance remains consistent, as it successfully captures higher SNR packets during collisions. FTrack's performance degrades further in low SNR conditions, falling below that of standard LoRa in high aggregate network traffic scenarios.

**D4: Wide Area Deployment - SubNoise, NLoS**  
This deployment is the most challenging, with received SNRs below noise levels. CIC's performance excels in this regime, providing almost 10 times the throughput of standard LoRa. FTrack is unable to decode at these SNRs and completely fails. Both Choir and standard LoRa suffer from heavy packet losses due to low SNR and collisions. Interestingly, the net throughput of LoRa increases slightly at higher aggregate rates because the gateway successfully captures more packets with higher signal strengths, primarily from a small subset of transmitters whose aggregate rate also increases proportionally.

### Conclusion
The experiments demonstrate that CIC significantly outperforms FTrack and other schemes, especially in wide area deployments where received signal strengths are below noise levels, achieving up to 10 times the throughput. CIC's superior performance is attributed to its interference cancellation mechanism, guided by Heisenberg’s Time-Frequency uncertainty principle.

### Preamble Detection Accuracy

Packet detection using preambles is the first and most crucial step in decoding a packet. As discussed in Section 5.8, CIC modifies the commonly used preamble detection using up-chirps to down-chirps. In this section, we evaluate CIC's packet detection performance under packet collision scenarios and compare it against conventional approaches. Figures 32, 33, 34, and 35 show the packet detection rate, defined as the ratio of the number of detected packets (not necessarily correctly decoded) to the total number of transmitted packets, for each deployment and aggregate transmit rate. We compare the detection performance of CIC to FTrack and standard LoRa. We are unable to compare the preamble detection of Choir, as the authors do not describe their preamble detection method; thus, we assume standard LoRa-based packet detection for Choir.

**D1: High SNR, LoS**  
As shown in Figure 32, CIC outperforms FTrack by a margin of about 20% as the aggregate network traffic (and hence packet collision rate) increases. Standard LoRa's packet detection quickly degrades with increasing aggregate packets in the network.

**D2: High SNR, NLoS**  
As SNR decreases, the packet detection rates of both CIC and FTrack suffer, but CIC still performs better with a margin of over 20%.

**D3: Low SNR, NLoS**  
With further decreasing SNR, FTrack's packet detection rates deteriorate significantly, falling below that of standard LoRa in high aggregate network traffic scenarios. CIC, however, offers close to 80% detection even at very high aggregate network traffic.

**D4: SubNoise SNR, NLoS**  
In this deployment, FTrack is unable to detect packets, while standard LoRa has a detection rate of about 5%. Although CIC's preamble detection performance decreases, it still offers up to 80% in low traffic and 50% in very high traffic scenarios.

### Conclusions
Using down-chirps as the first step for packet detection significantly improves packet detection rates under collisions, especially in low and sub-noise SNR scenarios common in both indoor and outdoor LoRa deployments.

### Effect of Additional Features in CIC

As discussed in Section 2, existing works rely on grouping symbols from the same transmitter by exploiting various discriminating features such as received power and carrier frequency offset (CFO). CIC uses two additional features—received power and CFO—to filter out candidate frequencies when CIC is unable to cancel them sufficiently. To evaluate the contribution of these features, we use four different versions of CIC:

- **CIC**: Implementation with both received power and CFO.
- **CIC-(CFO)**: Implementation with only received power.
- **CIC-(Power)**: Implementation with only CFO.
- **CIC-(Power, CFO)**: Implementation without either feature.

Figures 36 and 37 depict the aggregate network throughput for each version in deployments D1 and D4, respectively. D1 (High SNR, LoS) represents the easiest scenario for CIC, while D4 (Outdoor, SubNoise SNR, NLoS) is the hardest, representing the two extreme cases.

**D1: High SNR, LoS**  
As seen in Figure 36, CIC gains about 20% using both received power and CFO. Most of these gains are due to the received power feature, which contributes about 18%, while CFO provides a marginal gain of about 2%.

**D4: Outdoor, SubNoise SNR, NLoS**  
As seen in Figure 37, even though the net achieved throughput is lower, the relative gains due to each feature remain consistent, with received power providing the most significant improvement.

### Conclusion
Received power as a feature helps CIC the most, providing close to 18% gains. While CFO also assists CIC, it does so modestly, contributing about 1-2%.

### Effect of Temporally Close Collisions

As discussed in Section 5.5, CIC can effectively cancel transmissions with symbol boundaries far apart. In this section, we investigate how CIC is affected by the proximity of interfering symbol boundaries. Since synchronizing two COTS LoRa devices to transmit within sample-level accuracies is challenging, we rely on simulations. In our simulations, we generate packets with random bits and create raw signals as a LoRa transmitter would. We then superimpose two such packets with varying sub-symbol time offsets. As the two colliding packets are closer than 10% of the symbol time, CIC starts to experience a high symbol error rate (SER).

### Conclusion
In this work, we proposed Concurrent Interference Cancellation (CIC), a novel demodulation technique for LoRa receivers to decode multiple colliding packets concurrently. CIC cancels out interfering symbols by selecting the optimal set of sub-symbols and incorporates prior work on LoRa packet collisions as additional features. Implemented in real outdoor and indoor deployments using 20 COTS LoRa transmitters and USRP as a gateway, CIC shows significant improvements in network throughput compared to standard LoRa receivers and state-of-the-art research works. CIC is robust to variations in SNR across LoRa devices, making it suitable for practical LoRa deployments. This work does not raise any ethical issues.
