Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
Issue loading the js chunk files on IE11 (only). With the latest version of
react 16.7.0 our app (which uses Suspense and Lazy) doesn't load all the
needed js chunks. You need to navigate around the app to request other js
chunks and eventually the app is fully loaded.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
We have a routes.js file with all the routes of the app. It looks like this:
    const Organisation = lazy(() => import('./pages/Organisation'));
    const Services = lazy(() => import('./pages/Services'));
    // all the other dynamic imports go here
    // ...
    const Page404 = lazy(() => import('./pages/Page404'));
    export default (
        }>
    );
The route "/" is redirected to "/organisation" which returns the
"Organisation" component. However, the Organisation component is not rendered,
the chunk hasn't been requested on demand. If we navigate to "/services" the
services chunk is requested on demand and loaded well. Then, if we go back to
"/organisation" all is fine.
There are no shown errors at all.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
The js chunks are requested on demand loaded and the components are rendered
when we initially load the app.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
This worked in all previous version of React that we tried since Lazy and
Suspense was released in 16.3.0
React version: 16.7.0  
OS: Win7  
Browser: IE11
