**Current behavior**  
using vs code the type of `ElementRef.nativeElement` is `any`.  
**Expected behavior**  
shouldn't the type be `Element` so we can get code completion and type
checking?
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
plnkr won't work because it doesn't do type checking (to my knowledge)
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
so we can get code completion and type checking
