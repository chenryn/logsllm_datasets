User: I am building python2.6 from source on Debian Lenny. 
( ./configure make make altinstall )
I don't want it to conflict with anything existing, but I want it to be in the default search path for bash. 
Suggestions?
(ps, I'm using a vm, so I can trash it and rebuild.)
Assistant: Your safest bet is to put Python 2.6 in /opt (./configure --prefix=/opt), and modify /etc/profile so that /opt/bin is searched first.
