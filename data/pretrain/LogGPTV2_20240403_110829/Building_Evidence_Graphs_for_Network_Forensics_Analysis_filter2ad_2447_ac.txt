### 3. Windows DCOM Remote Buffer Overflow Attack
- **Attack Description**: A Windows DCOM remote buffer overflow attack is executed from stepping stone 1 against stepping stone 2.

### 4. Downloading Attack Tools and Starting a Backdoor
- **Action**: Attack tools are downloaded from the FTP relay to stepping stone 2, and a backdoor is initiated on stepping stone 2.

### 5. Frontpage Server 2000 Buffer Overflow Attack
- **Attack Description**: A Frontpage Server 2000 buffer overflow attack is launched against the victim from stepping stone 2.

### 6. Downloading and Initiating Backdoor on Victim
- **Action**: A backdoor program is downloaded from the FTP relay to the victim, and the backdoor is activated on the victim.

### 7. Data Transfer and Closing Backdoor Connections
- **Action**: Data is transferred from the victim to the FTP relay, and the backdoor connections are closed.

### 5.2 Evidence Preprocessing
- **Alert Aggregation**: During the attack, Snort generated 7501 alerts. Using our flexible alert aggregation procedure, these alerts were condensed into 4 hyper-alerts related to port scan activity and 17 hyper-alerts representing other exploits. The self-extending time window was set to 60 seconds.
- **Aggregated Alerts**: The aggregated hyper-alerts are illustrated in Figure 3.

### 5.3 Evidence Graph Construction
- **Initial Evidence Graph**: Based on the primary evidence intrusion alerts, the initial evidence graph (Figure 3) was generated. Each edge in the graph is labeled with a number indicating the chronological order of the corresponding evidences.
- **FTP Relay Involvement**: No exploit activities were detected involving the FTP relay, so it does not appear in the initial evidence graph.
- **Filtering and Querying**: Analysts can apply filter conditions to remove irrelevant evidences and specify queries for secondary evidence to provide a more comprehensive view of network activities. For example, by ignoring all port scan attacks and focusing on file transfer connections during a specified time window, the updated evidence graph (Figure 4) is generated.
- **Updated Evidence Graph**: The updated evidence graph (Figure 4) includes potentially suspicious hosts, including the FTP relay. Specific alerts in Figure 3 are abstracted using the knowledge base to provide a high-level overview in Figure 4.

### 5.4 Local Reasoning
- **Host State Inference**: The analyst examines the states of hosts using the RBFCM-based local reasoning process. The inferred states of nodes in the evidence graph are shown in Table 2.
- **Highlighted Hosts**: Hosts with the "Attacker" state activated are highlighted in Figures 3 and 4.

### 5.5 Global Reasoning
- **Initial Seed Selection**: The host with the highest degree, 192.168.22.4, is chosen as the initial seed for the attack group.
- **Group Expansion**: The attack group is expanded by evaluating the distance between candidate nodes and the seeds. Distances between neighbor pairs are shown in Table 3. With a distance threshold of 1, the resulting attack group is visualized in the correlation graph (Figure 5).
- **Attack Group Analysis**:
  - **Host 192.168.21.3**: Only the "Attacker" state is activated.
  - **Hosts 192.168.25.3 and 192.168.22.4**: Both have the "Stepping Stone" state activated.
  - **Host 192.168.23.4**: Has both "Attacker" and "Victim" states activated but not "Stepping Stone".
  - **Hosts 129.186.215.40 and 192.168.24.4**: Affiliated with attackers and stepping stones, requiring further investigation.
  - **Host 192.168.22.6**: Labeled as an attacker in local reasoning but unrelated to the main attack group, suggesting it may be a background attacker.

### 6. Conclusions and Future Work
- **Summary**: This paper presents a network forensics analysis mechanism for reasoning about attack groups and scenarios. We introduced the evidence graph as a novel model for presenting and manipulating intrusion evidence. Based on this, we proposed a hierarchical reasoning framework for automated evidence analysis.
- **Local and Global Reasoning**: Local reasoning with RBFCM helps identify possible roles of suspicious hosts, while global reasoning identifies highly correlated hosts in an attack group and refines their roles.
- **Prototype Tool**: A prototype tool was developed, and initial experimental results demonstrate the potential of our methods.
- **Future Work**: We plan to refine our approaches in local and global reasoning, automate the process for hypothesizing missing evidence, and validate hypotheses. We will also collaborate with industrial and government agencies for more realistic experiments.
