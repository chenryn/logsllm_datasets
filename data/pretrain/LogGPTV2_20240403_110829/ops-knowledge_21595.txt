User: Please introduce the infrastructure and core technologies of cloud computing.
Assistant: The infrastructure and core technologies of cloud computing are as follows: 1. Virtualization technology: Virtualization technology isolates and abstracts physical resources (such as CPU, storage, and network) into multiple virtual resources for dynamic allocation and management. 2. Distributed system technology: Distributed system technology includes distributed computing, distributed storage, distributed message delivery and other aspects. They enable distributed management and collaborative work of computing and storage resources. 3. Automated management technology: Automated management technology is the key to realizing efficient operation, resource optimization, fault self-healing, and service elasticity of the cloud computing platform. These include automated configuration, automated scaling, automated monitoring, and more. 4. Big data processing technology: Cloud computing platforms generally face a large amount of data processing and analysis work, which requires the use of big data processing technologies, such as distributed storage, data mining, machine learning, NLP, image recognition and other technologies. 5. Security protection technology: User data needs to be protected in the cloud computing platform, so it is necessary to adopt various security protection technologies such as identity authentication, access control, and encryption. Generally speaking, the infrastructure and core technologies of cloud computing cover multiple aspects such as computing, storage, and network, and are necessary technologies for building a cloud computing platform. At the same time, these technologies are constantly developing and improving to cope with increasingly complex application scenarios and business needs.
