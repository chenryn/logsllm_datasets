User: I'm using AWS for the first time and have just installed boto for python.  I'm stuck at the step where it advices to:
"You can place this file either at /etc/boto.cfg for system-wide use or in the home directory of the user executing the commands as ~/.boto."
Honestly, I have no idea what to do.  First, I can't find the boto.cfg and second I'm not sure which command to execute for the second option.
Also, when I deploy the application to my server, I'm assuming I need to do the same thing there too...
Assistant: For anyone looking for information on the now-current boto3, it does not use a separate configuration file but rather respects the default one created by the aws cli when running aws configure (Ie, it will look at ~/.aws/config)
