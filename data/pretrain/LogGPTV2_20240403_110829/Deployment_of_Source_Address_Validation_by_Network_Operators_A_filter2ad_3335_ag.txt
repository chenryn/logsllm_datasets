APPENDIX A
NOTIFICATION TEXT
A. Direct Notiﬁcations – Baseline
Subject : Possible IP spooﬁng from AS X
We are security researchers from Delft University of Technol-
ogy. We have conducted a test to detect potential IP spooﬁng.
DETECTED ISSUE: We have observed that your network
may be allowing IP spooﬁng. You can check the test results
at: [LINK]
WHAT TO DO: We encourage you to deploy Source Ad-
dress Validation (BCP38) in your network today: https://www.
manrs.org/isps/guide/antispooﬁng/
HOW TO VALIDATE: Please run the Spoofer tool to validate
if BCP38 was implemented correctly: https://www.caida.org/
projects/spoofer/#software
CONTACT: If you have any questions, concerns, issues, or
comments, please send an email to infospooﬁPI:EMAIL
B. Direct Notiﬁcation – Social Nudge
Subject : Possible IP spooﬁng from AS X

at: [LINK]
WHAT TO DO: We encourage you to deploy Source Ad-
dress Validation (BCP38) in your network today: https://www.

C. Direct Notiﬁcation – Reciprocity
Subject : Possible IP spooﬁng from AS X
We are security researchers from Delft University of Technol-
ogy. We have conducted a test to detect potential IP spooﬁng.
DETECTED ISSUE: We have observed that your network
may be allowing IP spooﬁng. You can check the test results
at: [LINK]

and comprehension and has been validated by the experts. We
highly recommend you including this draft in your notiﬁcation
to the network operators.

G. NOG Notiﬁcation
CAIDA’s source address validation measurement project
(https://spoofer.caida.org) is automatically generating monthly
reports of ASes originating preﬁxes in BGP for systems from
which we received packets with a spoofed source address.
We are publishing these reports to network and security
operations lists in order to ensure this information reaches
