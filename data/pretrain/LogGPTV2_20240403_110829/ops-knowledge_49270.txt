User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is related to network activity. It begins with the kernel disabling AirPort_Brcm43xx and setting the BTCoex Config. It then denies network-outbound access to mDNSResponder and suspends AWDL. The log then shows the en0 SSID 'CalVisitor' making the interface primary, followed by a job being ignored due to the start time not being for 16227 seconds. The Thunderbolt HPD packet is then unplugged, followed by the bssid changing and AWDL operation mode being set to AUTO. The log then shows a journal record being dropped due to the primary key failing, followed by a message type being sent and hashes being generated. The log then shows CNPluginHandler evaluating, another job being ignored due to the start time not being for 16034 seconds, Wake on Scan offload, an unrecognized attribute value, PM response taking 1938 ms, and a connection to 183.57.48.75:80@0 failing due to the network being down.
