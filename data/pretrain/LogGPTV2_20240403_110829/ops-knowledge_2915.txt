User: could you help me with that. I can't manage to install this plugin. I tried:
1) install it through pip
2) through setup.py in win console
3) through anaconda3 but still no.
4) I searched about it in web and here, but insructions are made to older versions.
5) and also through the installation page of eyeD3. 
Could you guide me how should I do this? Maybe I'm doing something wrong. For first: should I use for this Python 2.7.9 or can it be Anaconda3
Assistant: The problem is that this file is only written for Python 2 but you are using Python 3. You should use Anaconda (vs. Anaconda3), or create a Python 2 environment with conda with conda create -n py2 anaconda python=2 and activate it with activate py2.
