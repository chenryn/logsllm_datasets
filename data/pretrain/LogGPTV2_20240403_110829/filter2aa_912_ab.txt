# Overview of Email Client Security Vulnerabilities

## 1. Introduction
This document provides an overview of the security vulnerabilities in various email clients, focusing on attacks on encryption and digital signatures. We will also discuss potential mitigation strategies.

## 2. Attacks on Encryption
Encryption oracles can be exploited to reveal plaintext content. The following table summarizes the vulnerabilities in different email clients across various operating systems:

| OS       | Client         | Decryption (S/MIME) | Decryption (PGP) | Signatures (S/MIME) | Signatures (PGP) |

### Key:
- **●**: Covert rules kept in reply message
- **◐**: Covert rules only for received mail
- **○**: No vulnerabilities found
- **–**: Cryptosystem not available

## 4. Evaluation
The evaluation reveals that 22 out of 24 tested email clients are vulnerable to at least one type of attack. The root causes of these vulnerabilities include the use of long-term keys and ciphertext usage out-of-context.

## 5. Mitigation
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following strategies can be implemented:

- **Accepting ASCII text only**
- **Enforcing digital signatures**
- **Warning on partial encryption**
- **All-or-Nothing Encryption**

For signature oracles, the following measures can be taken:

- **Dropping CSS Support**
- **Only ASCII Text in replies**
- **Removing styles from replies**

## Conclusion
- **Crypto is not enough, bypasses exist**
- **22 of 24 tested clients are vulnerable**
- **Building security on top of email is hard**
