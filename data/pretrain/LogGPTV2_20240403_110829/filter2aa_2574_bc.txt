reconnaissance techniques.
Tip! Use more than one service for subdomain discovery because some services 
may return partial results based on their discovery method.
 DNS Reconnaissance
After gathering information about the WHOIS records and target subdomain names, you 
can acquire more passive information about the target domain. In this section, we will 
list passive reconnaissance techniques to gather information regarding the DNS servers 
and the DNS records. The next stage is port scanning and other active reconnaissance 
techniques, which are considered outside our book’s scope of OSINT-gathering activities.
 Route Mapping
To determine the path to the target network, you need to use the tracert command. 
Please note that when information goes through networks, it does not follow the same 
path every time; it passes through different routers, firewalls, and other computing 
devices before reaching its destination. For high-value websites, the tracert command 
will be disabled, but it does not hurt to test it for your target website. There are many 
tools to perform tracerouting. On the Windows OS, open a command line prompt and 
type tracert followed by the target domain name (see Figure 8-8).

 Common DNS Record Types
Before collecting information from the target DNS, you need to know the main DNS 
record types. The domain name system has many records associated with it. Each one 
gives a different set of information about the related domain name. These are the most 
common DNS records:
• 
A is usually used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host. It is 
used for IPv4 records.
• 
AAAA is the same as record type A but used for IPv6 records.
• 
CNAME is the canonical name record. This record is often called an 
alias record because it maps an alias to the canonical name.
• 
MX is the mail exchange record. It maps domain names to its mail 
server responsible for delivering messages for that domain.
• 
NS is the name server record. It handles queries regarding different 
services related to the main domain name.
• 
TXT is the text record. It associates arbitrary text with a domain 
name.

 nslookup Command
This command helps you discover various DNS information about the target domain 
name in addition to its resolved IP address. The command is available on both Windows 
and Linux. Let’s begin by finding the A record of the target domain name (see Figure 8- 9).
To see the MX records (mail server records) associated with the target domain name, 
type the command shown in Figure 8-10.
In the same way, you can extract the IP address from any mail exchange server of the 
target domain name by typing set type=a and then entering the mail server address to 
resolve it into an IP address (see Figure 8-11).

335
By knowing the mail exchange server IP address, you can further implement IP 
searching techniques on this IP address to locate more information about it, as you will 
see next.
You can use nslookup in the same way as using web tools; let’s practice it using the 
MXtoolbox website.
Go to https://mxtoolbox.com and enter the target domain name in the search box. 
The site gives DNS information about a target domain name such as DNS lookup, MX 
lookup, WHOIS lookup, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) lookup, and DNS propagation. 
All this information is shown in a graphical user interface. An important feature of this 
site is that it gives you the authoritative name server of the target domain name (see 
Figure 8-12). Authoritative means the DNS server is the one that holds the actual DNS 
records (A, CNAME, MX, and so on) for the target domain name. Please note that during 
our previous nslookup tests, we were receiving a “nonauthoritative answer” when 
querying the target domain name. This because we are receiving a response from a 
cached version or from a local DNS server (your ISP’s DNS server).

any website. To use it, go to https://searchdns.netcraft.com, enter the target domain 
name in the text box, and click the lookup button (see Figure 8-13). Netcraft will generate 
a detailed security report about the target website that includes the following (and more):
• 
Network information (IPv6, domain register, name server, DNS 
admin contact, hosting company, and more)

 Summary
Gathering technical information about a target website and network system is known 
as technical footprinting. During this book we focused on passive reconnaissance 
techniques, as the essence of OSINT gathering is concerned with acquiring publicly 
available information that does not need a permit in order to collect it. In this chapter, 
we covered tools and techniques that can be used to acquire OSINT intelligence about 
the target’s website and network infrastructure passively.
In the next chapter, we will talk about the future and how the widespread use of the 
Internet, mobile communications, and social media platforms will impact the future of 
OSINT-gathering techniques.

CHAPTER 9
What’s Next?
OSINT has become the preferred information-gathering method for intelligence 
agencies around the world. Traditionally, intelligence services relied on other channels 
to acquire information with varying degrees of reliability and usefulness; however, 
as computing technology continues to advance and the Internet and social networks 
are even more widely accessible around the globe, intelligence services have shifted a 
large percentage of their intelligence-gathering activities into the OSINT scope. Some 
intelligence experts estimate that more than 90 percent of intelligence information is 
coming now from OSINT sources.
OSINT is not limited to intelligence services, law enforcement, and military 
agencies. OSINT has become an integral component in the decision-making process 
for governments, business corporations, UN agencies, nongovernmental organizations, 
academia, the media, and civil societies such as citizen advocacy groups and labor 
unions. Nowadays, corporations use OSINT to investigate internal leakages, collect 
competitor intelligence, and predict trends in foreign markets. OSINT is also used by 
black hat hackers and criminal organizations to explore data that could be used to better 
attack or socially engineer a target.
 Where Will OSINT Go Next?
The information age has resulted in an explosive amount of potential intelligence 
sources and will shape the future of OSINT gathering. In the intelligence arena, it is 
predicted that the practice of harvesting online data to counter terrorism and solve 
crime will increase. In addition, OSINT will continue to offer a cheap method to acquire 
intelligence about any community around the globe. For example, many studies show 
that recent protests in Arab countries were predicted by western security services after 
analyzing Arabic users’ behaviors on social platforms at that time.
342
In the civil area, businesses will be more willing to develop their own OSINT 
capabilities to gain competitive advantages and to secure their investments in an ever- 
changing world. Large organizations will work to have their own OSINT teams, while 
commercial OSINT providers will continue to offer their services to small and medium 
corporations that cannot afford to have an independent OSINT-gathering department.
Note! Many corporations already use OSINT for risk prediction, which they call 
competitive intelligence or business intelligence.
From an information security perspective, OSINT gathering will continue to be a 
stepping stone for most penetration testing assessments to evaluate system weaknesses 
and work to fix them quickly. Organizations will work to integrate their OSINT 
intelligence into an organization’s overall cyber-defense strategy to protect their assets 
and to strength their security posture.
The main obstacle against OSINT gathering is the mass volume of data that needs to 
be processed. Indeed, the huge advancements in mobile computing and the increased 
speed of the Internet will make people more willing to post a considerable volume 
of data to the Internet. This tremendous stream of public data will make analyzing it 
extremely time-consuming. Governments and giant corporations are continually testing 
new technologies to overcome this. Investments in analytic technology have become 
a priority by many governments and giant IT corporations as it will lead to processing 
huge volumes of data in order to turn it into data that can be queried and modeled to 
build conclusions quickly.
Note! Data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices is also considered 
a major challenge. In the near future, it is expected that we will have billions of 
working IoT devices. The resulting data/metadata from these devices is huge and 
requires sophisticated analytical tools to gain useful intelligence from them.
Another challenge to OSINT gathering is the predicted growth of “fake news” online. 
Currently major social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter face a real challenge 
to counter such activities. New algorithms—and usage policies—should be developed to 
verify news sources automatically before considering them valid OSINT sources.

343
Advancements in computing technology will certainly lead to creating efficient 
algorithms to handle the massive volume of data and to separate the irrelevant data from 
the target data. The advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies 
will again transform OSINT in the coming years.
 OSINT Process
During this book, we did not explicitly talk about the process—or specific flow of steps—
that should be followed to gather OSINT. The OSINT-gathering activities can take place 
in no particular order according to each case or purpose. However, the flow of chapters 
in this book can also considered a good way to organize your OSITN searching activities.
In general, there are five main stages for any OSINT-gathering activity, as explained 
here:
 1. Identify the sources: You identify the sources where you want 
to collect this data (e.g., the Internet, newspapers, magazines, 
commercial databases, and so on).
 2. Harvest the data: You use different tools and techniques to gather 
data from the target sources; bear in mind that you should follow 
passive techniques to gather this data.
 3. Process and verify the data: You process the gathered data and 
verify uncertain data from the data from more than one source if 
possible. You should also identify current and outdated data and 
exclude the irrelevant data from further analysis.
 4. Analyze the data: You analyze the data and try to find connections 
between it to formulate a complete picture about the target.
 5. Deliver the results: You present a report of your findings to the 
relevant party. This step is important and usually overlooked by 
many OSINT gatherers. It is necessary to present your key findings 
in an easy-to-understand format for any end user.

 Final Words
To conclude, we think the future of OSINT is extremely bright! Both public and private 
organizations will work to integrate OSINT gathering into their overall decision-making 
processes. New industries will be eager to exploit the huge data resulting from the 
information revolution to support their business strategies and intelligence.
We hope this book was successful in shedding light on this important concept that 
have been widely used since the dawn of history under different names.
