Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple connections from the same IP address (172.181.208.156) to the ftpd software component at the same time (Tue Jul 26 05:47:42 2005). It also shows two authentication failures from the sshd(pam_unix) software component from a different IP address (207.243.167.114) at different times (Tue Jul 26 07:02:27 and Tue Jul 26 07:02:35).
