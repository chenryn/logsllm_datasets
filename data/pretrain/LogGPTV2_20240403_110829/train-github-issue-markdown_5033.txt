### Describe the issue:
input: np.arange(1.0125, 1.1, 0.0125)  
output is: array([1.0125, 1.025 , 1.0375, 1.05 , 1.0625, 1.075 , 1.0875, 1.1
])  
output expected: array([1.0125, 1.025 , 1.0375, 1.05 , 1.0625, 1.075 , 1.0875
])
### Reproduce the code example:
    #They do not have the same behavior
    np.arange(0.0125,0.1,0.0125)
    np.arange(1.0125,1.1,0.0125)
### Error message:
    No error occurs, but the output is not as expected since there is one array element to much.
