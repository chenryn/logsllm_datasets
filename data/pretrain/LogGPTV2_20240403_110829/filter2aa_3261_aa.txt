AWWA, National Water Security Congress, 2009  
Publication:  June, 2010 NEWWA Journal 
Objective of this talk:  To make a realistic assessment of the potential of a  
terrorist attack, cyber or kinetic, against US public water systems. 
NOTE: Nothing will be presented here to assist anyone seeking to attack drinking water 
systems. Only information from open sources will be presented. The objective of this 
presentation is to improve the protection of public water systems from attack. 
DISCLAIMER: the views expressed are my own, not of any organization of which I am a member 
What the #@#!! is a 
Water Commissioner? 
• Its  a New England thing 
• Elected position, usually 3 
Commissioners, 3 year 
term 
• In most other places the 
Water Dept. is part of the 
DPW, run by an appointed 
Superintendent 
• Policy-making, managerial, 
not day to day 
• Budget, rate increases, etc.

How Important is Drinking Water? 
•
Water is essential for public health 
•
Infrastructures that are dependent on 
drinking water: 
Agriculture 
Food  
Public Health 
Emergency Services 
Government  
National Defense Industrial 
Information & Telecommunications 
Energy 
Transportation 
Banking &  Finance 
Chemical Industry & Hazardous Materials 
Postal & Shipping 
National Monuments

Drinking water has been the target of 
attacks for thousands of years 
•
500 BC, Assyrians poisoned the wells of their 
enemies with rye argot. 
•
1462, Vlad the Impaler burned villages and poisoned 
his own wells to deny them to the invading Turks. 
•
In 1844, a mob destroyed a reservoir in Mercer 
County, Ohio, they considered it a health hazard. 
•
1907-1913, Los Angeles aqueduct was bombed to 
prevent diversion of water Owens Valley to LA. 
•
1939-1942, Japan’s Unit 73 poisoned wells and 
reservoirs with typhoid and other pathogens. 
•
1977, North Carolina reservoir was poisoned with an 
unknown substance 
•
1992, Turkey, potassium cyanide found in Turkish Air 
Force water ; Turkish Workers Party takes credit. 
•
1998-1999, Kosovo, Serbs dispose of bodies in wells 
to poison them 
•
2003, Michigan, four incendiary devises found in 
water bottling plant; ELF claims responsibility 
•
2006, Sri Lanka, Tamil Tiger rebels cut the water 
supply for government held villages; government 
then attacks the reservoirs 
7 
There have been terrorists threats to 
poison US public water supplies  
•
1972 – Order of the Rising Sun, Chicago, 
typhoid cultures 
•
1985 - Covenant Arm & Sword of the Lord, 
Arkansas, potassium cyanide 
•
2001 - FBI warning of a “North African terror 
group” threat to 28 US water supplies 
•
2002 – FBI arrests two Al Qaeda suspects with 
papers on poisoning US water supply 
•
2003 – Al-Qaeda in Saudi magazine does not 
rule out “poisoning of drinking water” in US 
•
2003 - Handwritten notes seized from the Al 
Qaeda Tarnak Farms, Afghanistan showed 
plans to poison drinking water with 
pathogens 
•
2003 – Greenville, North Carolina, ricin found 
at Post Office with threat  to water supply 
•
2008 – Al Qaeda website calls on members to 
attack US water supplies. 
8 
Terrorists do have some  
cyber capability 
•
Al Qaeda has computer training centers 
•
Al Qaeda has people with IT skills 
•
Al Qaeda uses the internet to connect their 
loosely interconnected separate cells across 
the world 
•
They perpetrate cybercrime to raise funds 
•
There is no evidence that Al Qaeda has 
perpetrated a cyber attack on a water facility, 
or any facility, or plans to do so. 
•
Evidence seems to suggest that Al Qaeda uses 
the internet extensively for:  
-organizing, 
-propaganda, disinformation , 
-management of their organization, 
-raising funds, and 
-stealing money, but 
-not for cyber terrorism itself, yet 
•
That, of course, could change…. 
9 
There have been some cyber  
attacks on water systems 
• 1994 – Salt River Project 
water dept., Arizona 
• 2000 – Maroochy Water 
System, Australia 
• 2006 – Harrisburg, PA 
water treatment plant 
• 2007 – Tehema Colusa 
Canal Authority, California 
• 2009 – Cyber incidents in 
water systems have 
increased by 30% (RISI)

Public water system strategic advantage: 
 fragmented infrastructure 
•
There are 155,693 public water systems, 
serving 286 million Americans. 
•
The systems are varied, heterogeneous, run 
by variety of small-large local governments 
•
This ‘fragmentation’ is seen as a 
disadvantage for efficient management 
national water usage 
•
8% of U.S. water systems (12,445) provide 
water to 82% of the U.S. population 
•
0.2% of US water systems (404 ) are large 
systems that serve 46% of the population 
•
Some water ‘conglomerates’ 
•
No one ‘infrastructure’; there are just many 
independent, individual systems  
•
Contrast that with the national electric 
infrastructure which is interconnected  
•
An attack on any one node of an electric 
grid could take that entire grid down 
•
Any attack on a single water system is 
limited to that system. 
11 
Water Conglomerates 
• American Water.  
-  Largest private US water 
provider 
- Operates in 35 states 
- Serves 15 million people 
in 1,600 communities 
• United Water – 7 million 
• Aquarion – 3 states 
12 
Water system interdependencies 
• The operation of a public 
water system depends on 
many factors outside of it’s 
control 
• Electrical power is clearly 
the most pervasive; many 
have backup power, many 
do not 
• But, the treatment 
chemicals used is a critical 
factor … especially 
Chlorine 
13 
Public water systems vulnerability: 
Concentration of chlorine production 
•
Geographic concentration of critical 
infrastructures is a strategic vulnerability.  
•
Treatment chemicals could be contaminated ,as 
a potential vector of attack 
•
Treatment chemicals include potassium 
permanganate, lime, ferric chloride, & chlorine 
•
84% of large water systems use chlorine 
•
Chlorine production is concentrated:  
•
38% of all US chlorine production is in coastal 
Louisiana.  
•
A few well placed bombs at plants & railways 
could stop the shipments of chlorine and shut 
down a large percentage of drinking water 
supplies. 
•
Al Qaeda has considered directly attacking US 
rail lines 
•
A n attack on chlorine production plants could 
potentially shut them down or damage them. 
•
Or… the chlorine could be intentionally 
contaminated in the production plant or in 
transit; there are a few potential substances 
that could be effective for this. 
14 
Types of Attacks 
•
Public water systems are vulnerable to 4 types 
of attacks: 
(1) Chemical contamination 
(2) Biological contamination 
(3) Physical disruption 
(4) Disruptions of SCADA 
•
Chemical, biological & radiological (CBR) 
contamination must meet this criteria: 
1. Weaponized, meaning it can be produced 
and disseminated in large enough quantities 
to cause desired effect.  
2. Water threat, meaning it is infectious or 
toxic from drinking water.  
3. Stable, meaning the agent maintains it 
structural and virulent effects in water.  
4. Chlorine resistant 
•
There is a short list of CBR that are plausible to 
cause mass casualties 
•
Also can be a combination attack

Public water system components 
16 
Goal of PWS is to produce water: 
(1) P -With sufficient pressure; 
(2) S - Safe to drink; and 
(3) A - Available on demand 
Source of Water Supply 
•
Two main sources:  
- reservoirs (surface water; watershed) 
- wells (ground water, aquifer) 
•
Reservoirs range in size from a few acres  to the largest, 
Lake Mead – 247 million square miles, 9.28 trillion gallons 
•
Wells draw water from aquifers, underground lakes. They 
range in size from just a few acres to hundreds of square 
miles. Ogalla Aquifer in US, covers 174 million square miles 
over 5 states 
•
Large sizes are both impossible to secure but also regarded 
as impractical to effectively poison 
•
For example, Dillon Reservoir in Denver has 83 billion 
gallons of water; contaminating to just 10 parts per million 
would require 830,000 gallons of contaminant - a fleet of 
over 55 tanker trucks with 15,000 gallons 
•
Many instances of accidental contamination, such as 
Milwaukee 1993 , & the Walkerton Ontario 2000 ecoli 
contamination 
•
Also, since the water is later treated, limits the 
effectiveness, if any, of toxins added to supply 
•
Instrumentation: some systems remotely monitor water 
quality in source area, also water flow, streamflow
