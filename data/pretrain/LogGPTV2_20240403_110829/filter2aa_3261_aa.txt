## What is a Water Commissioner?

- **New England-specific role**: Elected position, typically three commissioners serving three-year terms.
- **Policy and Management**: Unlike other regions where the Water Department is part of the Department of Public Works (DPW) and run by an appointed Superintendent, Water Commissioners focus on policy-making and managerial tasks.
- **Responsibilities**: Budgeting, rate increases, and strategic decision-making.

## Definitions

- **Public Water System**: A system that provides piped water for human consumption.
- **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**: Systems used for process control and distributed control.
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Essential services, including drinking water, that are vital to the functioning of society.
- **Cyberterrorism**: The use of digital means to cause harm or disruption to critical infrastructure.

---

## Importance of Drinking Water

- **Essential for Public Health**
- **Interdependent Infrastructures**: Agriculture, food, public health, emergency services, government, national defense, industry, information and telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking and finance, chemical industry, postal and shipping, and national monuments.

## Historical Attacks on Drinking Water

- **500 BC**: Assyrians poisoned wells with rye ergot.
- **1462**: Vlad the Impaler burned villages and poisoned wells.
- **1844**: Mercer County, Ohio, reservoir destroyed due to health concerns.
- **1907-1913**: Los Angeles aqueduct bombed to prevent water diversion.
- **1939-1942**: Japanese Unit 731 poisoned wells with pathogens.
- **1977**: North Carolina reservoir poisoned with an unknown substance.
- **1992**: Potassium cyanide found in Turkish Air Force water.
- **1998-1999**: Kosovo, Serbs disposed of bodies in wells.
- **2003**: Michigan, incendiary devices found in a water bottling plant.
- **2006**: Sri Lanka, Tamil Tiger rebels cut water supply; government retaliated.

## Terrorist Threats to U.S. Public Water Supplies

- **1972**: Order of the Rising Sun, Chicago, typhoid cultures.
- **1985**: Covenant Arm & Sword of the Lord, Arkansas, potassium cyanide.
- **2001**: FBI warning of a North African terror group threat.
- **2002**: FBI arrests Al Qaeda suspects with plans to poison water.
- **2003**: Al-Qaeda in Saudi magazine and Tarnak Farms notes.
- **2003**: Ricin found in Greenville, North Carolina, with a threat to the water supply.
- **2008**: Al Qaeda website calls for attacks on U.S. water supplies.

## Cyber Capabilities of Terrorists

- **Al Qaeda has computer training centers and skilled IT personnel.**
- **Internet usage for organizing, propaganda, disinformation, and fundraising.**
- **No evidence of Al Qaeda perpetrating a cyber attack on a water facility.**
- **Potential for future cyber terrorism remains a concern.**

---

## Cyber Attacks on Water Systems

- **1994**: Salt River Project, Arizona.
- **2000**: Maroochy Water System, Australia.
- **2006**: Harrisburg, PA water treatment plant.
- **2007**: Tehema Colusa Canal Authority, California.
- **2009**: 30% increase in cyber incidents in water systems (RISI).

---

## Strategic Advantage: Fragmented Infrastructure

- **155,693 public water systems serving 286 million Americans.**
- **Diverse and heterogeneous systems managed by various local governments.**
- **8% of systems (12,445) serve 82% of the population.**
- **0.2% (404) large systems serve 46% of the population.**
- **Contrast with the interconnected national electric grid.**
- **An attack on one water system is limited to that system.**

---

## Water Conglomerates

- **American Water**: Largest private U.S. water provider, operates in 35 states, serves 15 million people in 1,600 communities.
- **United Water**: Serves 7 million people.
- **Aquarion**: Operates in 3 states.

---

## Water System Interdependencies

- **Dependence on external factors, especially electrical power.**
- **Backup power availability varies.**
- **Treatment chemicals, particularly chlorine, are critical.**

---

## Vulnerability: Concentration of Chlorine Production

- **Geographic concentration of critical infrastructures.**
- **84% of large water systems use chlorine.**
- **38% of U.S. chlorine production in coastal Louisiana.**
- **Potential for disruption through attacks on plants and railways.**
- **Intentional contamination of chlorine during production or transit.**

---

## Types of Attacks

- **Chemical Contamination**
- **Biological Contamination**
- **Physical Disruption**
- **Disruptions of SCADA**

### Criteria for CBR Contamination

1. **Weaponized**: Can be produced and disseminated in large quantities.
2. **Water Threat**: Infectious or toxic from drinking water.
3. **Stable**: Maintains structural and virulent effects in water.
4. **Chlorine Resistant**

### Potential for Mass Casualties

- **Short list of CBR agents.**
- **Combination attacks possible.**

## Components of Public Water Systems

- **Goal**: Produce water that is pressurized, safe to drink, and available on demand.
- **Sources**: Reservoirs (surface water) and wells (groundwater).
- **Reservoirs**: Vary in size, from small to Lake Mead (247 million square miles, 9.28 trillion gallons).
- **Wells**: Draw from aquifers, ranging from small to the Ogallala Aquifer (174 million square miles over 5 states).
- **Security and Contamination**: Large sizes make them impractical to secure and contaminate effectively.
- **Accidental Contamination**: Examples include Milwaukee (1993) and Walkerton, Ontario (2000).
- **Instrumentation**: Remote monitoring of water quality and flow.

## Conclusion

This presentation aims to highlight the vulnerabilities and potential threats to the U.S. public water infrastructure, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and ongoing vigilance to protect this critical resource.
