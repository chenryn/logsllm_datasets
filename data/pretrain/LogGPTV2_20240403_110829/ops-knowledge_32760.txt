User: How to load balance? What are some common load balancing algorithms?
Assistant: Load balancing is to distribute requests to multiple servers to avoid overloading a single server, thereby improving system performance and fault tolerance. Common load balancing algorithms are as follows: 1. Round robin algorithm: Distribute requests to different servers in turn, and select a server that accepts the request earliest each time. 2. Minimum connection algorithm: Distribute the request to the server with the least number of current connections to ensure a more balanced load. 3. Least processing algorithm: Distribute the request to the server with the lightest load to ensure the maximum throughput of the system. 4. IP hash algorithm: perform hash calculation according to the source IP address of the request, and then send the request to the corresponding server for processing. 5. Weighted round-robin algorithm: each server is assigned a weight value, and requests are distributed in turn according to the weight value, making load balancing more balanced. 6. Weighted minimum connection algorithm: Calculate a weighted value based on the current connection number and weight value of the server, and then distribute the request to the server with the smallest value.
