## Feature Request
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
I've recently had an issue with 2 babel-plugins where the plugin would cause
issues in dependencies.  
Though there are PRs out to fix this issue in both, it may be better for a
solution on the babel level for other places where such an issue could occur.  
Reference:  
PavelDymkov/babel-plugin-auto-import#4  
vihanb/babel-plugin-wildcard#32
**Describe the solution you'd like**  
I think it would be good for there to be an `ignore` option that could be
applied on a given plugin.  
IE:
    module.exports = function(api) {
      ...
        plugins: [
          ['auto-import', {
            declarations: [
              { path: 'react', default: 'React',  members: ['Component'] },
              { path: 'react-native', members: ['View', 'Text', 'StyleSheet', 'Platform'] },
            ],
            ignore: 'node_modules',
          }],
          ['wildcard', {ignore: 'node_modules'},
        ],
      };
    };
Of course, I'm open to other ways of doing this.
**Describe alternatives you've considered**  
Other alternatives is to request PRs on any plugins that are problematic, but
sometimes they take a while to get merged (at the time of posting, neither PRs
of the two problematic plugins are merged).  
I guess I could republish the plugins or just install them from my own
repository, but that may not be the best solution either.
**Teachability, Documentation, Adoption, Migration Strategy**  
Users would be able to use this quite easily. In terms of Docs, I think it
could be mentioned as an option for plugins similar to the regular `ignore`
option
