### Title: Botconf2017: Knock Knock… Who’s There? Admin, Get In! An Overview of the CMS Brute-Forcing Malware Landscape

With over 18 million websites on the internet using WordPress [1] and hundreds of known vulnerabilities reported [2], this and other well-known Content Management Systems (CMS) have been systematically targeted by various threat actors over the past years. These attackers seek to exploit these systems for disposable infrastructure to launch further attacks. One of the most common types of attacks against CMSs is brute-forcing. The primary objective of a brute-force attack is to obtain valid usernames and passwords to gain access to the CMS administration panel. Attackers often capitalize on the fact that many CMS users choose weak passwords. Successfully compromised websites are frequently used to host Command and Control (C&C) servers, facilitate scams, and conduct drive-by attacks to spread malware.

This presentation has three main objectives:

1. **Overview of Brute-Force Attacks**: We will provide a historical and current overview of brute-force attacks, discussing why WordPress is more frequently targeted compared to other CMS platforms.
2. **Botnets and Techniques**: We will examine different brute-forcing botnets and the techniques they employ.
3. **In-Depth Analysis of Sathurbot**: We will conduct a detailed analysis of the Sathurbot botnet. First identified in 2013 [3], Sathurbot remains active and continues to affect numerous users. The trojan consists of four known modules: backdoor, downloader, web crawler, and brute-forcing. The downloader module enables the trojan to deliver additional malware, such as Boaxxe, Kovter, and Fleercivet, to the infected machine. The web crawler module allows the trojan to search for websites using WordPress CMS through various search engines. The brute-forcing module attempts to log in to WordPress admin panels using different credentials.

The case study will focus on the web crawling and brute-forcing modules, providing specific insights from a real infection. It will offer an in-depth look at the infrastructure, target selection, aggressiveness, and an analysis of its success based on our observations. Finally, we will discuss detection methods to identify and mitigate these types of attacks.
