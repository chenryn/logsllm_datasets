User: I have suddenly started seeing this message on nearly every GDB output line whilst debugging:

Python Exception  Installation error: gdb.execute_unwinders function is missing

What is this? How do I rectify it?
Assistant: I have the same, with gdb 8.0.1 compiled on Ubunutu 14.04 LST.
Turns out the installation misses the necessary Python files. One indication was that "make install" stopped complaining about makeinfo being missing - although I did not change any of the .texi sources.
My fix was to go into into the build area, into gdb/data-directory, and do "make install" once more, which installed the missing python scripts.
Must be some weird tool-bug somewhere.
