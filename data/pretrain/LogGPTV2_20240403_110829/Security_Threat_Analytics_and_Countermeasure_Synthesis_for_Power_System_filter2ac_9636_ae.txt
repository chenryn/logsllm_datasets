fore, in our experiments we observed smaller execution time
differences between satisﬁable and unsatisﬁable cases.
C. Time Complexity of Synthesis Mechanism
Impact of the number of buses: The execution time of
our proposed security architecture synthesis mechanism with
respect to different test bus systems is shown in Fig. 5(a).
We considered two scenarios in our experiments: (i) 90% of
the measurements are recorded for state estimation and (ii)
all of the measurements are recorded for state estimation. We
can see in the ﬁgure that the increase in the execution time is
quadratic in order. However, this execution time is signiﬁcantly
longer than that of the UFDI attack veriﬁcation model that we
see in Fig. 4(a). Because, in order to synthesize the security
architecture, the veriﬁcation model may be required to be
executed for many times till a security architecture is found.
Impact of the number of taken measurements: We again
analyzed the impact of the number of taken measurements
(the percentage of the total potential measurements) on the
time of security architecture synthesis. Fig. 5(b) shows the
evaluation results corresponding to the 30 and 57-bus test
systems. We observed that with the increase in the number
of taken measurements, the execution time increases linearly.
Since the selection of security architecture is based on the
buses, any increase in taken measurements does not increase
the selection time. However, we know that veriﬁcation time
increases with the increase in taken measurements (recall
Fig. 4(b)). As a result, the time for the security architecture
synthesis increases.

Fig. 5. The execution time of the security architecture synthesis mechanism in different experiments: (a) the execution time with respect to the number of
buses, (b) the execution time with respect to the number of taken measurements, (c) the execution time with respect to the attacker’s resource limit, and (d)
the execution time in unsatisﬁable cases with respect to the number of buses.
TABLE IV
Impact of the Constraints: A security architecture depends
on the given constraints, e.g., the attacker’s resource limit (i.e.,
the number of measurements to which the attacker can inject
false data). We analyzed the impact of this resource limit
(represented as the percentage of the total measurements) on
the security architecture synthesis time. The analysis result
is shown in Fig. 5(c). We observed that the synthesis time
decreases slowly with the increase in the attacker’s resource
limit value. This is due to the reason that by increasing
the attacker’s resources (i.e., higher possibility of successful
attack), the time to ﬁnd that a candidate security architecture
is unsuccessful (i.e., satisﬁability of the UFDI attack model)
decreases. As a result, the synthesis time decreases.
Performance in the Unsatisﬁed Cases: When the grid
operator’s resource is very limited, then there may be no
security solution. The execution time in such an unsatisﬁable
case is usually very high, because the synthesis mechanism
requires verifying of all the potential security architectures
to conclude that there is no security solution based on the
given constraints. Fig. 5(d) shows the execution times of the
synthesis mechanism in unsatisﬁable cases. In this analysis,
we took the IEEE 30-bus test system and varied the resource
limit values in two different scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario
the operator can secure no more than 11 buses, while in
the second the number is 9. In both of these scenarios, a
security architecture needs a minimum number of 12 buses to
be secured. In the ﬁgure, we see that the closer the resource
limit is to the minimum number of necessary buses, the higher
the execution time is to ﬁnd out that there is no solution.

When the limit is too close to the minimum requirement, the
unsatisﬁability comes at the very end of the search, i.e., the
early rejection of a potential search mostly does not take place.
D. Memory Complexity
The memory required by the SMT solver [12] for executing
our veriﬁcation model and candidate security architecture
selection model is evaluated in different IEEE bus test systems.
The memory requirement for an execution of the SMT model
depends mainly on the number of variables deﬁned in the
model and the number of intermediate variables generated
by the solver to implement the satisﬁability modulo theories
used in the model. The memory analysis results are presented
in Table IV, which shows that memory usage of our models
increases almost linearly with the number of buses.
VI. RELATED WORK
The concept of undetected false data injection attack was
presented in [2] for the ﬁrst time, which was extended in [17].
The authors discussed UFDI attacks considering different sce-
narios, such as limited access to meters and limited resources
to compromise meters, under arbitrary or speciﬁc targets,
assuming that the adversary has complete information about

the grid. In the general case, the attack vector computation
problem is NP-complete. Therefore,
the authors presented
few heuristic approaches that can ﬁnd attack vectors. Bobba
et al. in [6] showed that for detecting UFDI attacks it is
necessary and sufﬁcient to protect a set of basic measurements,
which is actually a minimum set of measurements ensuring
observability. Kim and Poor in [7] proposed a greedy sub-
optimal algorithm, which selects a subset of measurements
that can be made immune from false data injection for the
protection against UFDI attacks. Kosut et al. in [18] proposed
a mechanism based on the generalized likelihood ratio test to
detect UFDI attacks. Similar approach is found in [19] with
the help of adaptive cumulative sum control chart test.
Vukovic et al. in [10] proposed a number of security metrics
to quantify the importance of individual buses and the cost
of attacking individual measurements considering the vulner-
ability of the communication infrastructure. In [20], authors
claimed that an l1 relaxation-based technique provides an exact
optimal solution of the data attack construction problem. UFDI
attacks with incomplete or partial information are discussed
in [5], [11]. These works mathematically showed the impact
of incomplete knowledge on the potentiality of UFDI attacks.
However, none of the works discussed above provides a
comprehensive model of UFDI attacks considering different
attack attributes together. In our previous works [21], [22], we
have presented veriﬁcation models for the UFDI attacks with
respect to a list of attack constraints and the impact on the op-
timal power ﬂow (OPF) solution, which are limited to typical
UFDI attacks. In this work, we give a comprehensive solution
to this challenge with a broader attack scenario. We consider
topology poisoning attacks, i.e., false data injection attack to
topology status information, in modeling UFDI attacks, and
show that novel UFDI attacks are possible by intelligently
introducing topology errors along with the false data injection
to the measurements. Very recently, Kim and Tong have
presented algebraic conditions of undetected topology attacks
in power grids [23]. However, unlike to our work, the authors
have not addressed the undetected attacks to state estimation
leveraging the topology poisoning. In addition, utilizing this
framework, we also provide an automated security architecture
synthesis mechanism, which considers the grid operator’s
resource constraints with respect to an attack model.
VII. CONCLUSION
Securing state estimation against cyber-attacks
is of
paramount importance to maintain the integrity of the power
grid. We propose an SMT based formal framework to sys-
tematically investigate potential security threats, particularly
the feasibility of stealthy cyber-attacks, on state estimation.
The framework allows an operator to capture interdependency
among attack attributes to synthesize a security architecture,
which secures a set of buses for immunity against UFDI
attacks. The scalability of the model is evaluated with exper-
iments and case-studies on different IEEE test systems. Our
results show that our model can efﬁciently solve problems with
hundreds of buses. In the case of the IEEE 118-bus test system,
our veriﬁcation model execution time is 7 seconds on average,
while our synthesis mechanism takes around 2 minutes. The
proposed method provides a basis for the development of
cyber-security tools for modern power grids.
