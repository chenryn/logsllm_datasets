Abstract— We present SWAN, a system that boosts the
utilization of inter-datacenter networks by centrally control-
ling when and how much traﬃc each service sends and fre-
quently re-conﬁguring the network’s data plane to match
current traﬃc demand. But done simplistically, these re-
conﬁgurations can also cause severe, transient congestion
because diﬀerent switches may apply updates at diﬀerent
times. We develop a novel technique that leverages a small
amount of scratch capacity on links to apply updates in a
provably congestion-free manner, without making any as-
sumptions about the order and timing of updates at individ-
ual switches. Further, to scale to large networks in the face
of limited forwarding table capacity, SWAN greedily selects
a small set of entries that can best satisfy current demand.
It updates this set without disrupting traﬃc by leveraging a
small amount of scratch capacity in forwarding tables. Ex-
periments using a testbed prototype and data-driven simu-
lations of two production networks show that SWAN carries
60% more traﬃc than the current practice.

INTRODUCTION
The wide area network (WAN) that connects the data-
centers (DC) is critical infrastructure for providers of online
services such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Many ser-
vices rely on low-latency inter-DC communication for good
user experience and on high-throughput transfers for relia-
bility (e.g., when replicating updates). Given the need for
high capacity—inter-DC traﬃc is a signiﬁcant fraction of
Internet traﬃc and rapidly growing [20]—and unique traf-
ﬁc characteristics, the inter-DC WAN is often a dedicated
network, distinct from the WAN that connects with ISPs to
reach end users [15]. It is an expensive resource, with amor-
tized annual cost of 100s of millions of dollars, as it provides
100s of Gbps to Tbps of capacity over long distances.
However, providers are unable to fully leverage this in-
vestment today.
Inter-DC WANs have extremely poor ef-
ﬁciency; the average utilization of even the busier links is
40-60%. One culprit is the lack of coordination among the
services that use the network. Barring coarse, static limits

in some cases, services send traﬃc whenever they want and
however much they want. As a result, the network cycles
through periods of peaks and troughs. Since it must be pro-
visioned for peak usage to avoid congestion, the network is
under-subscribed on average. Observe that network usage
does not have to be this way if we can exploit the char-
acteristics of inter-DC traﬃc. Some inter-DC services are
delay-tolerant. We can tamp the cyclical behavior if such
traﬃc is sent when the demand from other traﬃc is low.
This coordination will boost average utilization and enable
the network to either carry more traﬃc with the same ca-
pacity or use less capacity to carry the same traﬃc.1
Another culprit behind poor eﬃciency is the distributed
resource allocation model of today, typically implemented
using MPLS TE (Multiprotocol Label Switching Traﬃc En-
gineering) [4, 24]. In this model, no entity has a global view
and ingress routers greedily select paths for their traﬃc. As
a result, the network can get stuck in locally optimal routing
patterns that are globally suboptimal [27].
We present SWAN (Software-driven WAN), a system that
enables inter-DC WANs to carry signiﬁcantly more traﬃc.
By itself, carrying more traﬃc is straightforward—we can let
loose bandwidth-hungry services. SWAN achieves high eﬃ-
ciency while meeting policy goals such as preferential treat-
ment for higher-priority services and fairness among similar
services. Per observations above, its two key aspects are i)
globally coordinating the sending rates of services; and ii)
centrally allocating network paths. Based on current service
demands and network topology, SWAN decides how much
traﬃc each service can send and conﬁgures the network’s
data plane to carry that traﬃc.
Maintaining high utilization requires frequent updates to
the network’s data plane, as traﬃc demand or network topol-
ogy changes. A key challenge is to implement these updates
without causing transient congestion that can hurt latency-
sensitive traﬃc. The underlying problem is that the updates
are not atomic as they require changes to multiple switches.
Even if the before and after states are not congested, con-
gestion can occur during updates if traﬃc that a link is sup-
posed to carry after the update arrives before the traﬃc
that is supposed to leave has left. The extent and duration
of such congestion is worse when the network is busier and
has larger RTTs (which lead to greater temporal disparity
in the application of updates). Both these conditions hold
1In some networks, fault tolerance is another reason for low
utilization; the network is provisioned such that there is am-
ple capacity even after (common) failures. However, in inter-
DC WANs, traﬃc that needs strong protection is a small
subset of the overall traﬃc, and existing technologies can
tag and protect such traﬃc in the face of failures (§2).
15for our setting, and we ﬁnd that uncoordinated updates lead
to severe congestion and heavy packet loss.
This challenge recurs in every centralized resource allo-
cation scheme. MPLS TE’s distributed resource allocation
can make only a smaller class of “safe” changes; it cannot
make coordinated changes that require one ﬂow to move in
order to free a link for use by another ﬂow. Further, recent
work on atomic updates, to ensure that no packet experi-
ences a mix of old and new forwarding rules [23, 29], does
not address our challenge. It does not consider capacity lim-
its and treats each ﬂow independently; congestion can still
occur due to uncoordinated ﬂow movements.
We address this challenge by ﬁrst observing that it is im-
possible to update the network’s data plane without creating
congestion if all links are full. SWAN thus leaves “scratch”
capacity s (e.g., 10%) at each link. We prove that this en-
ables a congestion-free plan to update the network in at
most (cid:100)1/s(cid:101)–1 steps. Each step involves a set of changes to
forwarding rules at switches, with the property that there
will be no congestion independent of the order and tim-
ing of those changes. We then develop an algorithm to
ﬁnd a congestion-free plan with the minimum number of
steps. Further, SWAN does not waste the scratch capacity.
Some inter-DC traﬃc is tolerant to small amounts of conges-
tion (e.g., data replication with long deadlines). We extend
our basic approach to use all link capacity while guaran-
teeing bounded-congestion updates for tolerant traﬃc and
congestion-free updates for the rest.
Another challenge that we face is that fully using net-
work capacity requires many forwarding rules at switches,
to exploit many alternative paths through the network, but
commodity switches support a limited number of forwarding
rules.2 Analysis of a production inter-DC WAN shows that
the number of rules required to fully use its capacity exceeds
the limits of even next generation SDN switches. We address
this challenge by dynamically changing, based on traﬃc de-
mand, the set of paths available in the network. On the
same WAN, our technique can fully use network capacity
with an order of magnitude fewer rules.
We develop a prototype of SWAN, and evaluate our ap-
proach through testbed experiments and simulations using
traﬃc and topology data from two production inter-DC
WANs. We ﬁnd that SWAN carries 60% more traﬃc than
MPLS TE and it comes within 2% of the traﬃc carried by
an optimal method that assumes inﬁnite rule capacity and
incurs no update overhead. We also show that changes to
network updates are quick, requiring only 1-3 steps.
While our work focuses on inter-DC WANs, many of its
underlying techniques are useful for other WANs as well
(e.g., ISP networks). We show that even without control-
ling how much traﬃc enters the network, an ability that is
unique to the inter-DC context, our techniques for global re-
source and change management allow the network to carry
16-25% more traﬃc than MPLS TE.
2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Inter-DC WANs carry traﬃc from a range of services,
where a service is an activity across multiple hosts. Ex-
ternally visible functionality is usually enabled by multiple

of tunnels that MPLS routers support is also limited [2].
internal services (e.g., search may use Web-crawler, index-
builder, and query-responder services). Prior work [6] and
our conversations with operators reveal that services fall into
three broad types, based on their performance requirements.
Interactive services are in the critical path of end user
experience. An example is when one DC contacts another
in the process of responding to a user request because not
all information is available in the ﬁrst DC. Interactive traﬃc
is highly sensitive to loss and delay; even small increases in
response time (100 ms) degrade user experience [35].
Elastic services are not in the critical path of user expe-
rience but still require timely delivery. An example is repli-
cating a data update to another DC. Elastic traﬃc requires
delivery within a few seconds or minutes. The consequences
of delay vary with the service. In the replication example,
the risk is loss of data if a failure occurs or that a user will
observe data inconsistency.
Background services conduct maintenance and provi-
sioning activities. An example is copying all the data of
a service to another DC for long-term storage or as a pre-
cursor to running the service there. Such traﬃc tends to
be bandwidth hungry. While it has no explicit deadline or
a long deadline, it is still desirable to complete transfers as
soon as possible—delays lower business agility and tie up
expensive server resources.
In terms of overall volumes, interactive traﬃc is the small-
est subset and background traﬃc is the largest.
2.1 Current trafﬁc engineering practice
Many WANs are operated using MPLS TE today. To
eﬀectively use network capacity, MPLS TE spreads traﬃc
across a number of tunnels between ingress-egress router
pairs.
Ingress routers split traﬃc, typically equally using
equal cost multipath routing (ECMP), across the tunnels
to the same egress. They also estimate the traﬃc demand
for each tunnel and ﬁnd network paths for it using the con-
strained shortest path ﬁrst (CSPF) algorithm, which iden-
tiﬁes the shortest path that can accommodate the tunnel’s
traﬃc (subject to priorities; see below).
With MPLS TE, service diﬀerentiation can be provided
using two mechanisms. First, tunnels are assigned priori-
ties and diﬀerent types of services are mapped to diﬀerent
tunnels. Higher priority tunnels can displace lower priority
tunnels and thus obtain shorter paths; the ingress routers of
displaced tunnels must then ﬁnd new paths. Second, pack-
ets carry diﬀerentiated services code point (DSCP) bits in
the IP header. Switches map diﬀerent bits to diﬀerent pri-
ority queues, which ensures that packets are not delayed
or dropped due to lower-priority traﬃc; they may still be
delayed or dropped due to equal or higher priority traﬃc.
Switches typically have only a few priority queues (4–8).
2.2 Problems of MPLS TE
Inter-DC WANs suﬀer from two key problems today.
Poor eﬃciency: The amount of traﬃc the WAN carries
tends to be low compared to capacity. For a production
inter-DC WAN, which we call IDN (§6.1), we ﬁnd that the
average utilization of half the links is under 30% and of three
in four links is under 50%.
Two factors lead to poor eﬃciency. First, services send
whenever and however much traﬃc they want, without re-
gard to the current state of the network or other services.
This lack of coordination leads to network swinging between
