STRENGTHSSTRENGTHS
•QRadar provides an integrated view of log and event data, with network flow and packets, vulnerability and asset data, and threat intelligence.
•Network traffic behavior analysis can be correlated across NetFlow and log events.
•QRadar's modular architecture supports security event and log monitoring in IaaS environments, including native monitoring for AWS CloudTrail and SoftLayer.•QRadar's technology and architectural approach makes it relatively straightforward to deploy and maintain, whether as an all-in-one appliance or a large-tiered, multisite environment.
•IBM Security App Exchange provides a framework to integrate capabilities from third-party technologies into the SIEM dashboards and investigation and response workflow.
CAUTIONSCAUTIONS
•Endpoint monitoring for threat detection and response, or basic file integrity requires use of third-party technologies.
•Gartner clients report mixed success with the integration of the IBM vulnerability management add-on for QRadar.
•Gartner clients report the sales engagement process with IBM can be complex and requires persistence.
2. ArcSightHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) sells its ArcSight SIEM platform to midsize organizations, enterprises and service providers. The platform is available in three different variations: the ArcSight Data Platform (ADP), providing log collection, management and reporting; ArcSight Enterprise Security Management (ESM) software for large-scale security monitoring deployments; and ArcSight Express, an appliance-based all-in-one offering that's designed for the midmarket, with preconfigured monitoring and reporting, as well as simplified data management.In 2015, HPE redesigned and simplified the ArcSight SIEM architecture and licensing model. Further enhancements include new features in the analyst user interface allowing more granular control over incoming events and incidents. New module releases included HPE ArcSight UBA; HPE ArcSight DNS Malware Analytics, providing malware detection based on DNS traffic analysis; HPE ArcSight Marketplace, a community exchange for integration with other vendor solutions; and SIEM context such as dashboards and report templates.Features and benefits: 	ArcSight Enterprise Security Manager (ESM): •	Data enrichment 	Correlation and analysis engine used to identify •	Categorization and normalization of data 	security threat in real-time& virtual

security team’s time and attention.
Also included are dashboards that monitor critical infrastructure, such as Cisco appliances, Microsoft® Windows®, and Linux®servers to quickly report on business critical infrastructure
ArcSight Architecture
Gartner Report about ArcSight 
ArcSight SIEM platform to midsize organizations, enterprises and service providers. 
The platform is available in three different variations: the ArcSight Data Platform (ADP), providing log collection, management and reporting; ArcSight Enterprise Security Management (ESM) software for large-scale security monitoring deployments; and ArcSight Express, an appliance-based all-in-oneThe ArcSight Data Platform (composed of ArcSight Connectors, ArcSight Management Center and Logger) can be deployed independently as a log management solution, but is also used as the data collection tier for ArcSight ESM deployments.
Premium modules, adding capabilities such as user and entity behavior analytics (ArcSight User Behavior Analytics [UBA]), DNS malware detection and threat intelligence, can be used to extend the SIEM's capabilities.HPE ArcSight can be deployed as an appliance, software or virtualized instance, and supports a scalable n-tier architecture with HPE ArcSight Management Center available to manage large and complex deployments. HPE ArcSight Express is available as an appliance only.
STRENGTHS
•ArcSight ESM provides a complete set of SIEM capabilities that can be used to support a large-scale SOC, including a full incident investigation and management workflow, and a dedicated deployment management console.•HPE ArcSight User Behavior Analytics provides full UBA capabilities in conjunction with SIEM.
•HPE ArcSight has a wide variety of out-of-the-box third-party technology connectors and integrations.
CAUTIONS
•HPE ArcSight proposals routinely include more professional services than comparable offerings.
•Customer feedback indicates that HPE ArcSight ESM is found to be more complex and expensive to deploy, configure and operate than other leading solutions.•Although ArcSight is among the top four vendors in competitive visibility with Gartner clients, the trend is decreasing visibility for new installs and increasing numbers of competitive replacements.
•HPE is undertaking a development effort to redo the core ArcSight technology platform. Customers and prospective buyers should track development plans to ensure the availability of features and functions needed to support existing or planned deployments.3.Splunk
The Splunk Security Intelligence Platform is composed of Splunk Enterprise — the core product from Splunk that provides event and log collection, search and visualization using the Splunk query language — and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES), which adds security-specific SIEM features. 
Data analysis is the primary feature of Splunk Enterprise, and is used for IT operations,application performance management, business intelligence and, increasingly, for security event monitoring and analysis when implemented with Enterprise Security. 
Splunk Enterprise Security provides predefined dashboards, correlation rules, searches, visualizations and reports to support real-time security monitoring and alerting, incident response, and compliance reporting use cases.Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security can be deployed on-premises, in public or private clouds, or as a hybrid. Both products are also available as a SaaS offering. 
Splunk's architecture consists of streaming input and Forwarders to ingest data, Indexers that index and store raw machine logs, and Search Heads.

Spunk's architecture consists of streaming input and Forwarders to ingest data, Indexers that index and store raw 
machine logs, and Search Heads that provide data access via the web-based GUI interface.STRENGTHS
•Splunk's investment in security monitoring use cases is driving significant visibility with Gartner clients.
•Advanced security analytics capabilities are available from both native machine learning functionality and integration with Splunk UBA for more advanced methods, providing customers with the necessary features to implement advanced threat detection monitoring and inside threat use cases.•Splunk's presence, and investment, in IT operations monitoring solutions provides security teams with in-house experience, as well as existing infrastructure and data to build upon when implementing security monitoring capabilities.
CAUTIONS
•Splunk Enterprise Security provides only basic predefined correlations for user monitoring and reporting requirements, compared with richer content for use cases provided by leading competitors.•Splunk license models are based on data volume in gigabytes indexed per day. Customers report that the solution is costlier than other SIEM products where high data volumes are expected, and recommend sufficient planning and prioritization of data sources to avoid overconsuming licensed data volumes. In the past 12 months, Splunk introduced licensing programs to address high-volume-data users.•Potential buyers of Splunk UBA should plan appropriately, as it requires a separate infrastructure and leverages a license model different from how Splunk Enterprise and Enterprise Security are licensed.
