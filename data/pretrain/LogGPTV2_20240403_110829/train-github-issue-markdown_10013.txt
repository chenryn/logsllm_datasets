## Bug Report
**Current Behavior**
The babel-cli in `--watch` mode does not output any messages following the
first compilation. It seems as though the CLI is not doing anything even
though files are compiling.
**Input Code**
    babel src -d lib --watch
**Expected behavior/code**
The CLI should display an output summary after every `--watch` mode
compilation.
**Babel Configuration (.babelrc, package.json, cli command)**
N/A.
**Environment**
  * Babel version(s): v7.0.0-beta.41 - v7.0.0-beta.46
  * Node/npm version: Node 10/npm 6
  * OS: macOS v10.13.4
  * Monorepo: No
  * How you are using Babel: `cli`
**Possible Solution**
**Additional context/Screenshots**
This issue began with #7439 in v7.0.0-beta.41. The babel-cli has a new a new
`--verbose` flag for seeing exactly what files were compiled, but even with
the verbose output of what files are being compiled there are no subsequent
summary messages. An output summary should be displayed every compilation,
regardless of the `--verbose` flag.
