User: We are developing a distributed system based on REST API and need to achieve load balancing and high availability of requests. Please give a reasonable load balancing and fault tolerance scheme.
Assistant: Load balancing scheme: 1. Based on DNS polling: Bind the IP addresses of multiple servers to the same domain name, and the DNS server will resolve the requests into different server IP addresses in sequence. You can control the time each IP is used by setting TTL. 2. Based on reverse proxy: By deploying a reverse proxy server on the load balancing server, the request is distributed to multiple back-end servers. The reverse proxy can use algorithms such as round robin, random or minimum number of connections to distribute requests. 3. Based on IP hashing: Perform a hash modulo operation on the client IP to get an integer value, divide this value by the number of servers to get a remainder, and forward the request to the server corresponding to the remainder value. Fault-tolerant solution: 1. Backup data through multiple copies: data replication is performed between multiple servers, and each server saves a copy of the same data to ensure that the backup data of other servers can be used in the event of a server downtime to ensure service availability. 2. Geo-redundant backup: back up data to different geographic locations to ensure that applications in other regions can continue to provide services when disasters or network failures occur in one region. 3. Through automated fault tolerance mechanisms: For example, by synchronizing data between multiple data centers in real time to achieve high availability and fault tolerance. At the same time, requests that cannot be responded within a short period of time can be recovered, reducing the impact of downtime.
