User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache2 starting, then port fails to bind I have centOS 6.4 64bit and apache2 (httpd) installed. I do:    

 /etc/init.d/httpd start     


And Apache starts up fine with just a green [Ok]

However; when I try to load any webpages hosted on it they fail to load and:

service https status    


Shows that https is stopped.

When using:

service httpd restart    


I get this error:

(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80
(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80
no listening sockets available, shutting down
Unable to open logs
                                                           [FAILED]


What could be causing apache to do this?

Assistant: use



    netstat -antu|grep 80
    lsof -i -n -P|grep 80
