### Abstract
The efficiency of Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) can be significantly improved by using interesting points, provided the attacker knows their positions. However, it is challenging to accurately locate these points with a small number of power traces. In this paper, we propose a Frequency-based Interesting Points Selection (FIPS) algorithm to select interesting points when only a limited number of power traces are available. Additionally, we introduce an error-tolerant Single Interesting Point based CPA (SIP-CPA). Experimental results on AES implemented on an AT89S52 single chip and DES on the Side Channel Attack Standard Evaluation Board (SASEBO) show that SIP-CPA significantly enhances the efficiency of CPA.

## 1. Introduction
Correlation Power Analysis (CPA), first proposed in [2], is one of the most powerful side-channel attacks. It does not require prior knowledge of the cryptographic device or its implementation. The attacker recovers the key by calculating the correlation coefficients between the assumed and real power consumption, with the maximum coefficient indicating the correct key.

### 1.1 Related Works
To improve CPA efficiency, signal processing techniques and accurate power leakage models have been proposed. Techniques like power trace alignment, denoising, and biasing power traces with high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) can enhance CPA. Interesting points, often used in Template Attacks, provide the most information for side-channel attacks. While interesting points are not always necessary for CPA, they can significantly improve its efficiency if selected correctly.

- We introduce an error-tolerant Single Interesting Point based CPA (SIP-CPA) combined with FIPS, which significantly improves CPA efficiency. Experiments on AES and DES demonstrate the effectiveness of SIP-CPA.

## 2. Choosing Interesting Points
In traditional CPA, the attacker does not need to know the locations of interesting points. However, using interesting points can enhance CPA by focusing on regions with higher correlation coefficients.

### 2.1 Frequency-based Interesting Points Selection Algorithm
We assume the attacker has a small number of power traces and does not know the locations of interesting points. To address this, we propose the FIPS algorithm, which selects interesting points from a small number of power traces.

#### Algorithm 1: Frequency-based Interesting Points Selection (FIPS)
**Input:**
- Power trace set \( T \) with \( m \) power traces and corresponding plaintexts \( P \).
- Time sample threshold \( k' \) and correlation coefficient threshold \( k \).

**Output:**
- Locations \( \text{Location}[1, \ldots, k] \) of the \( k \) interesting points.

**Steps:**
1. Use a percentage \( a \% \) of \( m \) power traces to perform traditional CPA.
2. Repeat the experiment \( \text{run} \) times, randomly selecting \( t \) power traces each time.
3. Identify the key \( \text{gkey} \) with the maximum correlation coefficient.
4. Record the frequency of each key in \( \text{Count1} \).
5. Select the key with the highest frequency as the correct key.
6. Choose \( k' \) interesting points with the highest correlation coefficients.
7. Calculate the frequencies of these points and select the \( k \) points with the highest frequencies.

### 2.2 Frequency-based Interesting Points Selection Using Time Sample Window
For large datasets, using all time samples is impractical. We propose a time sample window approach to search for interesting points.

#### Algorithm 2: FIPS Using Time Sample Window
**Input:**
- Power trace set \( T \) with \( m \) power traces and corresponding plaintexts \( P \).
- Time sample threshold \( k' \) and correlation coefficient threshold \( k \).

**Output:**
- Locations \( \text{Location}[1, \ldots, k] \) of the \( k \) interesting points.

**Steps:**
1. Define a time window size \( n \).
2. Slide the window across the time samples.
3. Perform CPA within each window and record the key with the highest correlation coefficient.
4. If the frequency of the correct key is significantly higher, identify the current window as containing interesting points.
5. Continue sliding the window until all time samples are covered.

### 2.3 Thresholds \( k' \) and \( k \)
The thresholds \( k' \) and \( k \) are crucial for accurate interesting point selection. Reasonable values for these thresholds are determined through repeated CPA experiments.

## 3. Single Interesting Point Based CPA
### 3.1 Basic Theory
Power consumption at an interesting point can be modeled as a normal distribution. For software implementations, the Hamming weight model is commonly used. The power consumption can be expressed as:
\[ P_{\text{total}} = a \cdot \text{HW}(\text{value}') + P_{\text{other}} \]
where \( \text{HW} \) is the Hamming weight function, and \( P_{\text{other}} \) represents other power consumption components.

### 3.2 Performing a Single Interesting Point Based CPA
When interesting points are selected using FIPS, the SIP-CPA can be performed as follows:
1. Select the interesting point.
2. Perform CPA using the selected interesting point.
3. Identify the key with the highest correlation coefficient.

## 4. Experimental Results
Experiments on AES implemented on an AT89S52 single chip and DES on SASEBO show that SIP-CPA significantly improves CPA efficiency.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper proposes the FIPS algorithm and SIP-CPA to enhance the efficiency of CPA with a small number of power traces. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.
