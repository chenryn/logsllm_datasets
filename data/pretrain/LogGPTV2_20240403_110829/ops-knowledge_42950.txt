I hope this post is in the appropriate section. I am quite new to Google App Engine, as it is part of an iOS application I recently acquired from another developer. Please bear with me.

The iOS application currently has 20,000 active users. I cannot afford to disrupt the system or the user experience, so my question is: Should I migrate to Python 2.7, given that the message on my dashboard states that Python 2.5 will soon be deprecated? If I do not migrate, will my user base decrease?

If I decide to migrate, is there a risk that something might go wrong and negatively impact the user experience or even destroy the user base? What potential issues could arise during the migration process?

Here is the message at the top of my Google App Engine dashboard:

"A version of this application is using the Python 2.5 runtime, which is deprecated! The application should be updated to the Python 2.7 runtime as soon as possible, as it offers performance improvements and many new features. Learn how simple it is to migrate your application to Python 2.7."

Thank you for your assistance.

Certainly, here's the situation:

You must migrate. Google has announced the deprecation of the Python 2.5 runtime and will continue to support it in accordance with the Google App Engine Terms of Service. Specifically, the Deprecation Policy states:

**7.3 Deprecation Policy.**
Google will announce if we intend to discontinue or make backward-incompatible changes to this API or Service. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate that Service without these changes until the later of:
(i) one year after the announcement or
(ii) April 20, 2015, unless (as Google determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):
- required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in applicable law or relationship), or
- doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.

Based on this, you have until some time in 2014 before they completely drop support for Python 2.5.

To proceed, follow these steps:

1. **Fork Your Application:** Create a separate branch or copy of your current application.
2. **Update the `app.yaml` File:** Modify the `app.yaml` file to specify the Python 2.7 runtime. For example:
   ```yaml
   runtime: python27
   api_version: 1
   threadsafe: true
   ```
   Setting `threadsafe: true` can potentially save you money by allowing more efficient resource usage.
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Conduct extensive testing of the migrated application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.
4. **Deploy Gradually:** Consider deploying the updated version to a small subset of users first to monitor for any issues before a full rollout.

By following these steps, you can minimize the risk of disruptions and ensure a smooth transition to Python 2.7.
