The ec2.py script now creates host groups based on instance tags, but I think
there might be two issues.
  1. The order of your inventory file needs to go:
non-tag groups  
tag groups
for the tag groups to work. For example:
    [local]
    127.0.0.1
    [eh_web]
    x.x.x.x
    [tag_Class_web]
    x.x.x.x
Is valid where x.x.x.x is a static IP. But:
    [local]
    127.0.0.1
    [tag_Class_web]
    x.x.x.x
    [eh_web]
    x.x.x.x
Only runs plays on x.x.x.x if you use the tag_Class_web group.
  1. I'm not sure this is a bug, but I would imagine the hostgroup should be allowed to be empty in the inventory file. Should this not work? Neither this format nor leaving the host group out entirely causes the EC2.py script to run.
    [local]
    127.0.0.1
    [tag_Class_web]
    [eh_web]
    x.x.x.x
