User: I have a web crawling python script running in terminal for several hours, which is continuously populating my database. It has several nested for loops. For some reasons I need to restart my computer and continue my script from exactly the place where I left. Is it possible to preserve the pointer state and resume the previously running script in terminal?
I am looking for a solution which will work without altering the python script. Modifying the  code is a lower priority as that would mean to relaunch the program and reinvest time.
Update:
Thanks for the VM suggestion. I'll take that. For the sake of completion, what generic modifications should be made to script to make it pause and resumable?
Update2:
Porting on VM works fine. I have also modified script to make it failsafe against network failures. Code written below.
Assistant: As others have commented, unless you are running your script in a virtual machine that can be suspended, you would need to modify your script to track its state.
