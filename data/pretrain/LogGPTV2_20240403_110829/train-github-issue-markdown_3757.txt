Subject: Issue with Dropdown Menu JavaScript and Middle Mouse Button

Hi,

I am experiencing an issue with the dropdown menu's JavaScript. Specifically, when I attempt to open links in a new tab by clicking the scroll wheel (middle mouse button), the functionality does not work as expected.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
