Repo steps:
  1. Enable `Override Windows Snap shortcut (Win + Arrow) to move windows between zones`.
  2. Span a window across 2 or more zones.
  3. Press `Win` \+ `←` or `→`.
Actual result:
  1. Window moved to next zone.
  2. Window lost any spanning.
Expected result:
  1. Moving from zone 2 & 3 to 3 & 4 shouldn't shrink the window.
  2. Moved to 3 & 4, with 4 being last, next move in that direction should shrink the window first, then move to next display (or most opposite display edge, if no further display exists).
  3. Maybe we need a new shortcut, e. g. `Win` \+ `CTRL` \+ `←` or `→`, then, because if shrunk due to aforementioned reasons, one might want to span again instead of moving to the next zone.
