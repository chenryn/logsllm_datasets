Question: "Your team is debating the inclusion of multiple code hardening defenses in a legacy system written in C. You understand that while these defenses do not guarantee complete security, they offer a layer of protection. Evaluate the following arguments and select the ones that present valid points in favor of using code hardening defenses:"
 "A": "By applying code hardening defenses, the team can focus on feature development without worrying about any memory safety exploits."
 "B": "Even though code hardening defenses do not make the system invulnerable, they contribute to a defense-in-depth strategy that increases overall security."
 "C": "The use of code hardening defenses is only a temporary solution until the entire codebase can be rewritten in a memory-safe language."
 "D": "Implementing multiple code hardening defenses can force an attacker to find multiple vulnerabilities, making it more difficult to compromise the system."
