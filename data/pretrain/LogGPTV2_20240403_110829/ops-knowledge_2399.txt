User: When I try to use cmd to open ipython notebook, I got this 
error:tornado.access:500 GET/static/base/images/favicon.ico?v=4e6c6be5716444f7ac7b902e7f388939<::1> 150.00ms referer=None
I tried to reinstall the python2.7.8 , pythonxy and chrome. But it still failed.
Can anyone have any idea to help me fix that?
Assistant: i think you start the python on behalf of user, that do not have access to python source files. Try to start the python application as root.
