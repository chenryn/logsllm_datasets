When attempting to open an IPython notebook using the command prompt (cmd), I encountered the following error:

```
tornado.access:500 GET /static/base/images/favicon.ico?v=4e6c6be5716444f7ac7b902e7f388939 (::1) 150.00ms referer=None
```

I have tried reinstalling Python 2.7.8, Python(x,y), and Google Chrome, but the issue persists.

Could anyone provide suggestions on how to resolve this problem?

It appears that you might be starting the Python application with a user account that does not have sufficient permissions to access the necessary Python source files. Try running the Python application as an administrator (or with elevated privileges). This can often resolve permission-related issues.
