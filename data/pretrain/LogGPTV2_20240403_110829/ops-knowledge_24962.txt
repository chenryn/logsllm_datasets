User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Hostname and SSL (apache) issue on Debian I have been trying to setup SSL virtual host

&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt; 

    ServerAdmin webmaster@mts.com
    ServerName moclm.tap.pt

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/moclm.cer
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/moclm.pem

    DocumentRoot /var/www/tapme/

    &lt;Directory /&gt;
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Order deny,allow
            Deny from all
            Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    &lt;Directory /var/www/tapme/&gt;
            Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            AllowOverride All
            #Order allow,deny
            #allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt; 

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


For some reason, the server automatically redirect to SSL (http:// to https://). The apache is not configured to redirect and application was working fine on port 80 only. I have no knowledge how the internal network works as i am working remotely.

The SSL error logs show:

[Tue Oct 02 22:40:32 2012] [error] Hostname linemnt01.tap.pt provided via SNI and hostname moclm.tap.pt provided via HTTP are different

I thought may be the hostname has some issue and have changed the hostname of the server from "linemnt01.tap.pt" to "moclm.tap.pt" but the issue is still there.

I am getting the following error on browser:


  Bad Request
  
  Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.


i have /etc/hosts:

    127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost       moclm.tap.pt    moclm


and openssl returns:

    openssl verify -CAfile cert-CA.cer moclm.cer
    moclm.tap.pt.cer: OK


I have been trying to troubleshoot the issue but no luck. Need help

Thanks

Assistant: If your apache config file does not have a line like this &lt;VirtualHost 192.168.1.100:443&gt; you need to add that before the relevant directory block(s) in apache2/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf Note the ip address needs to be available on the server and your website hostname (not necessarily the server hostname!) should have a DNS record pointing to that ip address if you want SSL to work without a warning.

Assuming you start apache using apachectl, you should run apachectl configtest before restarting apache to see if there are any warnings or errors.
