Overlay-layer solutions have been employed to address pressing problems, but they often fail to resolve underlying architectural issues [18–20, 22, 48–51]. As mentioned in Section 1, many have used overlays to tackle these challenges because the lack of evolvability is precisely what has traditionally plagued architectures. 

At the same time, our exploration might seem to focus only on how one might transition to the next generation architecture, rather than addressing the broader question of what an ideal next-generation architecture should be. This paper, in contrast, does not address how one might eventually and generally move beyond the current architecture, nor does it discuss the economic issues associated with partial deployment. Moreover, while many proposals document the technical aspects of their solutions, they do not typically consider the question of evolvability, in the sense of repeated improvements within the existing ISP infrastructure.

However, a few proposals, like ours, do choose to address these concerns.
