Abstract. Entropy-based measures have been widely deployed in
anomaly detection systems (ADSes) to quantify behavioral patterns. The
entropy measure has shown signiﬁcant promise in detecting diverse set
of anomalies present in networks and end-hosts. We argue that the full
potential of entropy-based anomaly detection is currently not being ex-
ploited because of its ineﬃcient use. In support of this argument, we
highlight three important shortcomings of existing entropy-based AD-
Ses. We then propose eﬃcient entropy usage – supported by preliminary
evaluations – to mitigate these shortcomings.
1 Entropy Limitations and Countermeasures
1.1 Feature Correlation Should Be Retained
Current ADSes perform entropy analysis on marginal distributions of features. In
general, signiﬁcant correlation exists across traﬃc and/or host features which is
not being leveraged by these ADSes. As a proof-of-concept example, we propose
to detect malicious network sessions by noting that the histogram of keystrokes
which are used to initiate network sessions is skewed [see Fig. 1(a)] and pertur-
bation in this metric can easily reveal the presence of an anomaly; network traﬃc
and keystroke data were collected before and after infecting a human-operated
computer with the low-rate Rbot-AQJ worm. While analyzing the entropies of
the marginal keystroke distribution and/or the marginal session distribution is
clearly not useful, Fig. 1(b) shows that quantifying these features using joint
(session-keystroke) entropy can easily detect anomalous activity.
1.2 Spatial/Temporal Correlation Should Be Retained
Another limitation of the entropy measure is its inability to take spatial/temporal
correlation of benign patterns into account. Such correlations can prove useful in
the detection of subtle anomalies. For instance, Fig. 1(c) shows the block-wise

(e) Destination Port Entropy
(f) Destination Port Relative Entropy
Fig. 1. Examples to support the limitations of the current use of entropy
(block size = 1KB) entropy of a PDF ﬁle which is infected by an embedded ex-
ecutable malware. It is evident that entropy is unable to provide clear perturba-
tions required for detection. On the other hand, entropy rate [Fig. 1(d)], which
models and accounts for the spatial/temporal correlation, provides very clear per-
turbations at the infected ﬁle blocks; entropy rate quantiﬁes the average entropy
of conditional distributions.
1.3 Randomness Quantiﬁcation Is Not Enough
Entropy cannot distinguish between diﬀering distributions with the same amount
of uncertainty; e.g., entropy of the normalized distribution of a source producing
90 packets on port 80 and 10 packets on port 21 is the same as a source producing
900 packets on port 6666 and 100 packets on port 6667. Thus anomalies which
do not perturb randomness go undetected. Fig. 1(e) shows a case where the
Blaster worm cannot be detected in the destination port entropy time-series.
This limitation arises due to the fact that entropy does not take the individual
port numbers into account. It is, therefore, important to perform a symbol-
by-symbol comparison between benign and observed distributions. This can be
achieved by computing the relative entropy of the distributions. Fig. 1(f) shows
that K-L divergence time series of destination port is perturbed due to the
presence of Blaster worm.
