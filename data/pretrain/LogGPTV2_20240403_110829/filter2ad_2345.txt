## Abstract
Entropy-based measures have been widely used in anomaly detection systems (ADSes) to quantify behavioral patterns. These measures have shown significant promise in detecting a diverse set of anomalies in networks and end-hosts. However, we argue that the full potential of entropy-based anomaly detection is not being realized due to its inefficient use. To support this argument, we highlight three key shortcomings of existing entropy-based ADSes and propose efficient entropy usage, supported by preliminary evaluations, to address these issues.

## 1. Entropy Limitations and Countermeasures

### 1.1 Feature Correlation Should Be Retained
Current ADSes typically perform entropy analysis on the marginal distributions of features. However, significant correlations often exist across traffic and host features, which are not leveraged by these systems. For example, the histogram of keystrokes used to initiate network sessions is often skewed [Fig. 1(a)]. Perturbations in this metric can easily reveal the presence of an anomaly. We collected network traffic and keystroke data before and after infecting a human-operated computer with the low-rate Rbot-AQJ worm. Analyzing the entropies of the marginal keystroke distribution and/or the marginal session distribution alone is not useful. Instead, Fig. 1(b) shows that using joint (session-keystroke) entropy can effectively detect anomalous activity.

### 1.2 Spatial/Temporal Correlation Should Be Retained
Another limitation of entropy measures is their inability to account for spatial and temporal correlations in benign patterns. Such correlations can be crucial for detecting subtle anomalies. For instance, Fig. 1(c) shows the block-wise entropy of a PDF file infected by embedded executable malware. The entropy does not provide clear perturbations for detection. In contrast, the entropy rate [Fig. 1(d)], which models and accounts for spatial/temporal correlation, provides very clear perturbations at the infected file blocks. The entropy rate quantifies the average entropy of conditional distributions.

### 1.3 Randomness Quantification Is Not Enough
Entropy cannot distinguish between different distributions with the same amount of uncertainty. For example, the entropy of a normalized distribution of a source producing 90 packets on port 80 and 10 packets on port 21 is the same as a source producing 900 packets on port 6666 and 100 packets on port 6667. This means that anomalies that do not alter randomness go undetected. As shown in Fig. 1(e), the Blaster worm cannot be detected in the destination port entropy time series because entropy does not consider individual port numbers. Therefore, it is essential to perform a symbol-by-symbol comparison between benign and observed distributions. This can be achieved by computing the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) of the distributions. Fig. 1(f) demonstrates that the K-L divergence time series of the destination port is perturbed due to the presence of the Blaster worm.
