ABSTRACT
Modern autonomous vehicles are commonly instrumented with
radars for all-weather perception. Yet the radar functionality is lim-
ited to identifying the positions of reflectors in the environment. In
this paper, we investigate the feasibility of smartening transporta-
tion infrastructure for the purpose of conveying richer information
to automotive radars. We propose RoS, a passive PCB-fabricated
surface which can be mechanically reconfigured to embed digital
bits, and inform the radar much like visual road signs do to cameras.
We design the RoS signage to act as a retrodirective reflector which
can reflect signals back to the radar from wide viewing angles. We
further introduce a spatial encoding scheme, which piggybacks in-
formation in the reflected analog signals based on the geometrical
layout of the retroreflective elements. Our prototype fabrication and
experimentation verifies the effectiveness of RoS as an RF “barcodež
which is readable by radar in practical transportation environment.

INTRODUCTION

If intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are to become a reality,
reliable and abundant information about the environment will be 
crucial for an efficient and safe driving experience. Mainstream
ITS technologies rely heavily on intelligent autonomous vehicles
[2], with myriads of on-board sensors and rapidly evolving algo-
rithms to approximate or even surpass human perception. Equally
important however, is an increasingly intelligent civil infrastruc-
ture.  A  smart  infrastructure  that  embeds  cameras,  sensors,  and
communication technologies can dramatically lower the perception

requirements of the vehicles, accelerating the progress towards ITS.
One of the most crucial elements in transportation infrastructure
is the road sign which displays traffic/speed/location information
to oncoming vehicles. Substantial research has been devoted to
automating the recognition of road signs through on-board cam-
eras and computer vision algorithms [25]. However, cameras are
fundamentally challenged by low-angle sunlight and poor visibil-
ity in adverse weather conditions (e.g., fog, snow, and rain). Such
limitations can be avoided by smartening road signs and embody-
ing infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication technologies,
such as RFID, DSRC, and C-V2X [47]. These solutions however,
require heavily instrumented road signs and compatible vehicles
which entail high deployment costs. In contrast, automotive radar
have already been widely installed on modern vehicles to sense
surrounding objects. If existing automotive radar could read road
signs directly, deployment costs could be reduced significantly.
In this paper, we propose retroreflective radar readable road sign
(RoS), a fully passive and chipless RF tag which overcomes the
fundamental limitations of legacy visual signage with minimal de-
ployment costs. Fig. 1 shows RoS and its general working scenario.
A RoS tag consists of a collection of millimeter-wave (mmWave)
antenna arrays which are designed on thin laminate boards and
can be fabricated via common PCB manufacturing processes. The
antenna arrays form a specially designed geometrical layout to
create distinct reflection patterns that can be sensed by an auto-
motive radar. The RoS tag’s layout is mechanically reconfigurable,
as the number and locations of the antenna arrays can be manu-
ally modified to create different reflection patterns. The tag can be
erected preceding a legacy road sign as a complementary radar-
readable sign. A vehicle passing by the tag can localize it, measure
its reflection pattern, and decode the embedded information with
its on-board radar. The vehicle can then notify the driver or take
actions accordingly.
Detecting and decoding RoS in a dynamic automotive scenario
poses many unique challenges. First of all, for RoS to work properly

and effectively with automotive radars, the RoS tag must be eas-
ily detectable in spite of the vehicle’s varying viewing angles and
distances. To increase the azimuth field-of-view (FoV), we use Van
Atta arrays (VAAs) [49] as a fundamental building block for the tag.
The VAAs retroreflect mmWave signals in the azimuth plane, i.e.,
radar signals that impinge on the VAAs will be reflected back to the
emitter. With VAAs, the RoS tag can create a quasi-omnidirectional
reflection pattern and hence an electrically wide angular view. To in-
crease the reading distance, RoS stacks multiple VAAs vertically to
increase its overall reflectivity. The stacking of VAAs unfortunately,
creates an unwanted beamforming effect where the beamwidth
along the vertical dimension can become extremely narrow. Con-
sequently, minor height misalignment between the radar and the
tag may result in extremely weak reflections and hence, decoding
failure. To mitigate the impact of such misalignment, we introduce
an elevation beam shaping mechanism which can synthesize wider
elevation beams without impacting the retroreflectivity on the az-
imuth plane. The beam shaping is achieved by treating the VAAs
within a stack as individual antenna “elementsž, and applying a set
of pre-determined phase weights on them. The phase weighting is
in term created by optimizing the relative lengths and layouts of
the transmission lines (TLs) within each VAA.
The second design challenge lies in interference due to back-
ground reflections. In the automotive environment, a plethora of
other objects, e.g., pedestrians and street lamps, can easily over-
whelm the return signal from an RoS tag due to their large size
and strong reflectivity. To filter out such background interference,
we design a polarization switching VAA (PSVAA) for the tag, which
alters the polarization of the incident signals to an orthogonal
polarity while reflections from ordinary roadside objects remain
intact. With this measure, the radar can easily single out the tag’s
reflections and suppress the environmental impact.
Third, it is non-trivial to encode information in a deterministic
way using a passive mmWave tag alone. A straightforward encoding
method is to print random metallic geometries on the tag, which can
be mapped to certain radiation patterns using a machine learning
model [28]. However, this method loses the retroreflective property
and its non-explainable models have no performance guarantees.
In other words, it is unclear how reliably the different symbols can
be discriminated by the radar and how many bits of information it
can actually encode. In RoS, we overcome such limitations through
a novel spatial coding scheme. We build a deterministic model
which establishes the relationship between the geometrical layout
of multiple PSVAAs and the corresponding reflection pattern. In this
way, the RoS tag can encode information by simply positioning the
VAAs following our model, and the radar can decode data bits by
sampling the reflection signal strengths across multiple locations.
Finally, it is challenging to accurately measure the reflection
pattern of a tag in the automotive scenario with a moving radar. To
overcome this challenge, RoS leverages the self-tracking capabilities
of modern vehicles to obtain a coarse estimation of the relative tag-
radar position. It further uses two features, i.e., point cloud size and
reflection loss, to discriminate the tag from other objects. The radar
can then beamform its signals to consistently “spotlightž on the
tag.
the radar has a relatively low transmit power and low sensitivity,
the decoding SNR of RoS consistently exceeds 14 dB in typical
scenarios, which translates into a bit error rate below 0.6%. The
RoS tag can be reliably decoded by the radar at a distance of up to
6 m, which fits common transportation scenarios where a vehicle
passes by the tag along a multi-lane road.
In summary, the main contributions of RoS include:
(i) Fully passive retroreflective smart surface comprised of an array
of VAAs. We have designed a passive chipless tag that is retroreflec-
tive for 77-81 GHz automotive radar signals. Owing to the novel
polarization switching and elevation beam shaping mechanisms,
our RoS tag can be reliably detected by a radar in practical roadway
conditions.
(ii) Spatial coding scheme. We design a novel spatial coding
scheme that exploits the deterministic relation between the tag’s
geometrical layout and its reflection pattern. We further introduce
mechanisms to enable the radar to accurately measure the tag’s
reflection pattern in a dynamic automotive environment.
(iii) Implementation and experimental validation. We have im-
plemented RoS using the standard PCB fabrication process which
allows for mass production and reconfiguration of the signage.
Our experiments verify the feasibility and accuracy of RoS, and its
usefulness as a new component in ITS.
2 RELATED WORK
Wireless I2V communications. A rich literature exists on wire-
less communications between infrastructure and vehicles (I2V)
which primarily focuses on improving efficiency and reliability.
DSRC and cellular C-V2X represent two mainstream I2V technolo-
gies. Both are witnessing limited deployment due to the cost in
instrumenting the vehicles and upgrading the base stations. Elec-
tronic toll collection systems (E-ZPass) have been deployed on
many roadway intersections and traffic hubs. E-ZPass consists of a
reader embedded within transportation infrastructure that queries
a battery-powered RFID tag mounted on a vehicle. Recent work
adapts RFID localization technologies to position vehicles with
E-ZPass onboard [1]. RoS differs from conventional I2V in that
the roadside infrastructure is fully passive and does not require
dedicated radio hardware. The main downside of RoS however, lies
in that it only encodes a fixed amount of information similar to
conventional road signs.
Vision based technologies for road-to-vehicle communi-
cation. Our work is motivated by the growing interest in ITS
which automates roadway infrastructure and vehicles to improve
efficiency and safety. Market solutions for such services already
exist, including smart streetlights for parking spot checking [8],
smart intersections that can monitor vehicle density and control
traffic lights [10], etc. These solutions require a smart camera to cap-
ture and process roadway status information. On-board computer
vision technologies have also been widely explored to assist drivers
by reducing missed road-signs and ultimately reduce accidents [25].
These technologies however, are plagued by variable lighting con-
ditions, sign orientation, sign aging, shadows of near-by objects,
and adverse weather conditions [7, 14].
We have fabricated RoS tags and conducted extensive field ex-
periments with TI’s experimental mmWave radar [22]. Although
To improve visibility, road signs today typically use a retro-
reflective coating and some even install LED lights. LEDs can be

further renovated to modulate information which can be captured
and decoded by on-vehicle cameras [23]. RetroI2V [59] exploits
visible light backscatter communication in the form of an active
road sign that can modulate the polarization of the vehicle’s LED
headlight and reflect the modulated signals to convey information.
Such systems still entail heavy instrumentation of both infrastruc-
ture and vehicles. In addition, they bear many of the same intrinsic
limitations as camera vision, i.e., vulnerability to adverse weather
conditions, although their detection range may be longer due to
the use of high dynamic range photodiode sensors.
Chip and chipless RFID. RFID technologies have proliferated
research areas such as wireless communications, energy harvesting,
object tracking, human-object interaction, etc. [16, 30, 39, 48, 58].
An RFID system comprises of an interrogating reader and a tag with
a RFID chip that is responsible for storing data and backscattering
signals. In [17, 32, 37], RFID tags are used to inventory road signs
and land marks. Vehicles with RFID readers can detect these tags
and decode information of road signs. Although RFID tags are low
cost and have high data encoding capabilities, it requires vehicles
to mount expensive RFID readers. In contrast, mmWave radars are
already abundant on vehicles today and are envisioned to be reused
with mmWave tags at low cost. In addition, due to large antenna
sizes in UHF band, it is difficult to realize retro-directive RFID tags.
Consequently, interference will become a daunting challenge in
areas with densely populated vehicles and tags. Ultra-low power
designs using power harvesters [38, 50] can be used to design pas-
sive RFID tags that modulate the backscattered mmWave signal.
However, with a required input power about 2 dBm, these ultra-low
power designs would have severely limited communication range
at mmWave band.
Chipless RFID can be considered as an RF barcode, manufactured
through PCB printing or even inkjet printing [21] which eliminates
the IC cost. Chipless RFID tags can encode information in the
frequency or time domain. A common frequency domain technique
is to use notch filters that attenuate specific frequency bins to
create unique identification signatures [5, 16, 24, 40]. Time domain
encoding generally inscribes information by modulating the timing
of pulses reflected back to the interrogator. Some examples include
surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) tags [41] or delay lines [51]. Despite
the low-cost, chipless tags have a major drawbackśthey generally
operate in smaller interrogation zones and have limited information
encoding capabilities compared to the IC tag variants. RoS aims
to bring the benefits of fully passive, chipless RFID tags into the
automotive sensing domain. To this end, RoS renovates the tag
design in two unique ways: (i) It leverages an array of retro-directive
VAAs to improve the reliability, reading range, and angular field-of-
view. (ii) It utilizes a scalable spatial domain encoding mechanism
to embed information in the RCS of the tag. Besides, RoS enables a
radar to interrogate the tag in practical driving scenarios.
Retro-directive antennas. Retro-directive antennas automati-
cally redirect incoming signals back to the direction of the source.
The most widely known retro-directive antenna is the corner-
reflector [27]. An alternative is active phase conjugation using a
mixer or passive phase conjugation through VAAs. Since its inven-
tion in the 1960’s [49], VAAs have been researched extensively to
realize retroreflection. Many VAA designs have been implemented
in the microwave frequency band [44, 63] using a variety of antenna
structures such as slots [33], rings [45] or patch [3].
The electromagnetic research literature has explored ways of
combining retro-directive antenna designs with information en-
coding capabilities [27, 62]. In [62], information is stored in the
frequency domain through the use of surface notch filters to at-
tenuate specific frequencies creating a spectrum signature. In [53],
the reflected signal phase is modulated by varying transmission
line lengths or by frequency shifting the incident signal as in
[26]. MmWave frequencies create new challenges for passive retro-
directors. Notch filter becomes impractical because of the difficulty
in achieving large filter gain at high frequency bands [13], whereas
phase based methods become extremely sensitive to multipath.
In addition, many chipless backscatters have been developed
using RF switch modulation [20, 29, 31, 52]. In Millimetro [52],
long-range and identifiable tags at 24 GHz are designed using VAAs
and RF switches. At design frequencies such as 900 MHz and 24 GHz,
reasonable RCS values can be achieved with minimal effort. How-
ever, translating these designs to the 77 GHz automotive radar band
(i.e., 76-81 GHz) poses many challenges such as routing of the RF
switches and obtaining sufficiently high RCS levels. For example,
in REITS [29], a total of 10 elements are used to create a VAA with
5 pairs of antennas at 24 GHz. Moving to 77 GHz, this design would
suffer an RCS reduction of 25.85 dB. To overcome this issue, many
more antennas would be required, complicating the joint routing
of transmission lines and RF switches.
In contrast, RoS represents the first work to create an array of
retro-directive VAAs and use their spacial layout to encode data. The
RoS tag does not require discrete RF components and is designed
to be directly detectable and decodable by an automotive radar.

3.1 Electromagnetic Signature of Objects
Radar signal propagation follows the well known round-trip path
loss model [35]:
𝑃𝑟 =
𝑃𝑡𝐺𝑡𝐺𝑟 𝜆2𝜎
(4𝜋 )3𝑑 4
(1)
where 𝑃𝑟 , 𝑃𝑡 , 𝐺𝑡 , 𝐺𝑟 , 𝜆, 𝑑 and 𝜎 are the received signal strength
(RSS), transmit (Tx) signal power, Tx gain, receive (Rx) gain, signal
wavelength in freespace, radar-to-object distance, and the Radar
Cross Section (RCS) of the object, respectively. This equation applies
to a typical monostatic radar, i.e., the Tx and Rx antennas are co-
located.
The RSS level 𝑃𝑟 is directly proportional to wavelength 𝜆, posing
a challenge at mmWave frequencies which suffer from higher at-
tenuation loss compared to microwave signals. Practical mmWave
radars often adopt MIMO beamforming, using multiple Tx/Rx an-
tennas to increase the Tx/Rx gain to compensate for the larger
attenuation.
The RCS 𝜎 is a measure of an object’s detectability to a radar
or how electrically large the object appears. Intuitively, RCS is the
ratio between the backscatter power per steradian in the direction
of the radar and the power density that is intercepted by the ob-
ject. The RCS area of an object does not necessarily overlap with
the physical cross-sectional area of that object. Instead, it depends
upon other factors such as material reflectivity, incident polariza-
tion, the radar’s viewing angles, and the directivity of the reflected
