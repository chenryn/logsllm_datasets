Problem: Role Based Access Control is not enabling users to view Dashboards
correctly.
Feature flag enabled: RBAC  
Browser: Firefox  
Superset Version 1.4
Background: I have assigned a user a role AlphaDG (essentially Gamma) and have
assigned this role to a dashboard.
Expected outcome: Even though the user has not been assigned access to the
underlying dataset(s), this user should be able to see the dashboard.
Actual outcome: The user is not able to see the dashboard (whether published
or not)
