### Issue: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Not Allowing Users to View Dashboards Correctly

**Feature Flag Enabled:** RBAC  
**Browser:** Firefox  
**Superset Version:** 1.4

#### Background
I have assigned a user the role `AlphaDG` (which is essentially equivalent to the `Gamma` role) and have assigned this role to a specific dashboard.

#### Expected Outcome
Even though the user has not been explicitly granted access to the underlying datasets, they should still be able to view the dashboard.

#### Actual Outcome
The user is unable to see the dashboard, regardless of whether it is published or not.
