Loving Vue JS - great job!
I have a weird problem though with FastClick when being used with it. Events
are firing, I';m listening for "click" accurately, Vue JS is not bothered by
it, until I try and set the data from the event to an object that is data-
bound. It's almost like it doesn't update the rendering of the view for that
binding.
The full use-case is I have an exercise selector component, where you select
the exercise and then that exercise gets used in an input element on the
previous screen. This all works fine until I use FastClick, and again the
issue appears to be just the data-binding bit. Everything else is working
fine.
Quite odd.
What's even weirder is that if I duplicate that exercise that has the selected
exercise in it, then it shows up in the duplicated exercise in the array, but
not the original. It's like the original isn't being rendered or hasn't
detected a change.
