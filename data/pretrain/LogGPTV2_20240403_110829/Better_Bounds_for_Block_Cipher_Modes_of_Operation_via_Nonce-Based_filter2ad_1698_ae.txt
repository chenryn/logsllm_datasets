AdvEncRFN
we conclude that for every (t, N, (cid:126)QE , (cid:126)B, m)-nonce respective ad-
versary A, there exists an (O (t ), N)-adversary A1 for F and an
(O (t ), N, (cid:126)B, µ)-adversary A2 for E for µ to be speci(cid:27)ed, such that

In this setting, the inputs to the block cipher are all di(cid:29)erent, unless
a nonce repeats (which does not occur since we are considering
nonce-respecting adversaries). Thus, the same input is never used
for two di(cid:29)erent keys, and the maximum query frequency µ equals 1.
For simplicity, we take the (cid:27)rst term in the bound in Eq. (5) of
Theorem 2.2. Letting Bmax = max{Bi}, we have that each key is
used Bmax times, and so

Consider now the case of N = 248 and Bmax = 216, as above, mean-

the advantage of distinguishing AES from a random permutation
(AdvPRPAES ) for such a N is extremely small. Next, for such a N,
4This bound is tight since an adversary in an IND-CPA game can distinguish between
encryptions of blocks that are all 0 versus encryptions of random blocks. This is because
encryptions of 0 will all have distinct ciphertexts, whereas encryptions of random
blocks will result in a collision between two ciphertext blocks at the birthday bound.

the term 6N/296 is very small (at less than 2−45). Now, regarding
AdvPRF, with κ = n = 128 (as in AES-128) and reasonable values
of TE, the dominant term in the advantage is N·Bmax2
. For these
parameters, we have that it equals 248·232
2128 = 2−48. Thus, overall, the
advantage5 is approximately 2−46 (since all advantages are mul-
tiplied by 1/2). In basic counter mode, this is broken with high
probability, whereas here this is well within the range of being
secure.

This is way beyond the birthday bound. Alternative choices of

Remark 2. We observe that many more blocks can be encrypted
when encrypting many smaller messages than when encrypting fewer
large messages. This is due to the fact that the key derivation is per
message, and thus is more e(cid:29)ective when more messages are encrypted.
Of course, this is only true due to our truncated key derivation method;
were we to use standard CTR key derivation, we would not be able to
encrypt more than 248 messages under any circumstances.
5.2 CTR Encryption with Random IVs
We now proceed to CTR with random nonces. As in Section 5.1, we
consider IVs of length (cid:96). Let Bi denote the length (in blocks) of the
ith message encrypted.

there is a collision in the blocks (as in the unique nonce case). Thus,

we have that the distinguishing probability is QE
,
2n+1
where QE is the number of encryption queries. When taking (cid:96) = 96
as is standard practice for AES-CTR, this means that at QE = 248
messages the scheme is broken with very high probability. As a
result, NIST recommends that CTR with random IVs not be used for
more that QE = 232 messages (guaranteeing that the distinguishing
probability is below 2−32). Thus, CTR with a random IV cannot
be used to encrypt many messages. However, note that if only
232 messages are encrypted, but each is of length 232, then the
2

factor. Thus, basic CTR cannot be used to encrypt many messages
or many blocks. Speci(cid:27)cally, in order to maintain a distinguishing
probability below 2−32 one must encrypt at most 232 messages and
at most 248 blocks overall.
distinguishing probability is still very high due to the ((cid:80)N
5To be exact, this is an upper bound on the advantage and not the advantage itself.
Throughout, when we say that the advantage is X , our intention is that the advantage
is upper-bounded by X .

2−32; we extend this recommendation to be the security bound for all types of attacks.

Remark 3. It is interesting to note that when using our method
for CTR with a random IV, we do not gain anything in the number
of messages being encrypted. However, we do gain signi(cid:27)cantly with
the overall number of blocks. Thus, it is possible to encrypt long
messages using our key derivation method, and security is maintained.
In contrast, when considering CTR with unique nonces, we also gain
signi(cid:27)cantly with respect to the number of messages encrypted.

5.3 AES-GCM with Unique Nonces
AES-GCM is an authenticated-encryption mode of operation; it uses
counter mode, with the addition of an authenticator. We analyze
this mode in Appendix B and show that we obtain the same bounds
as for CTR with unique nonces. In particular, although an additional
is added due to the fact that the setting
allows decryption queries, this is insigni(cid:27)cant. Thus, it is possible
to encrypt N = 264 messages of length Bmax = 216, N = 248
messages of length 224, or N = 232 messages of length 232, and still
remain within the NIST-recommended limit of 2−32 advantage. See
Appendix B for the full analysis.

5.4 AES-GCM with Random IVs
The analysis here is similar to the that of CTR mode with random
IV’s (Section 5.2), with the analysis of AES-GCM (Section 5.3). The
results are analogous, and lead to the same conclusions.
6 AES-GCM-SIV – BETTER NONCE-MISUSE
RESISTANCE
GCM-SIV is a fast nonce-misuse resistant AEAD mode of oper-
ation that was presented in [12]. (Hereafter, GCM-SIV refers to
the two-key variant of [12], with AES as the block cipher.) GCM-
SIV has di(cid:29)erent performance characteristics for encryption and
decryption. For encryption, it is slower than AES-GCM, because
achieving full nonce-misuse resistance requires, by de(cid:27)nition, two
(serialized) passes over the data. Nevertheless, since GCM-SIV can
use the same CPU instructions that accelerate AES-GCM, optimized
implementations run GCM-SIV (for 128-bit keys) at less than one
cycle per byte on modern processors.
Informally, GCM-SIV uses a universal-hash key (K1) and an
encryption key (K2), applies a universal hash function (GHASH)
with K1 to the encoded AAD (additional authentication data) and
MSG (plaintext to be encrypted), and generates an authentication
tag by AES-encrypting the hash value, XOR-ed with the nonce,
under K2. Finally, the plaintext MSG is encrypted with AES in
CTR mode, using K2, and with an initial counter derived from the
authentication tag. This strategy means that the initial counter
(e(cid:29)ective nonce for the CTR encryption) is pseudorandom for every
di(cid:29)erent nonce/message pair. Thus, even if the actual nonce repeats,
the e(cid:29)ective nonce used to mask the encryption is di(cid:29)erent for
di(cid:29)erent messages. The security bounds of GCM-SIV were proven
in [12, Theorem 4.3], as follows:
Theorem 6.1 (Theorem 4.3 of [12] (2-Key GCM-SIV)). The
GCM-SIV mode of operation is a nonce-misuse resistant authenticated
encryption scheme. Furthermore, for every adversary A attacking the
GCM-SIV construction, making qE encryption queries and qD decryp-
tion queries of maximum plaintext length m blocks with m < 232,7
there exists an adversary A(cid:48) making N(cid:48) queries to distinguish F from
a random function, such that

instead of n − m = 96 bits. Nevertheless, this modi(cid:27)cation is not related to the topic
of this paper, and we therefore assume this as the baseline.

collision occurs in a counter input to AES, which then would leak
plaintext material. In order provide a recommendation on the max-
imal number of GCM-SIV encryptions (with the same key), it is
useful to refer to NIST’s guidelines [9] for AES-GCM with a ran-
dom 96-bit IV (or any IV whose bitlength is not 96), which faces an
analogous situation. The NIST requirement is that the probability
of an IV collision should not exceed 2−32, and this is translated in
[9] to limiting the allowed number of encryptions with AES-GCM
using a random IV to 232.
With the same rationale, due to the L
/2n advantage, at most
248 blocks overall can be encrypted or decrypted in order to re-
main within the recommended NIST bounds [9]. Furthermore, the
/2n−m−2 bound places a limit of at most 239 messages of length
N2
216 blocks, or 242 messages of length at most 210 blocks.

Better bounds. We show how our key derivation method yields
far better bounds on the use of GCM-SIV. This method has already
been incorporated into the standard proposal for CFRG for GCM-
SIV [14]; however, the concrete bounds analyzed in [13] for this
proposal are signi(cid:27)cantly inferior to those that we provide here.
