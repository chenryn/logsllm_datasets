## 📝 Enable an option to omit the # pound sign when copying a hex code
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_  
After activating the color picker and clicking on the screen to capture the
hex code, capture that value without the pound sign. For applications where
I'm pasting in that data frequently they already have a pound sign in the
input field so it causes a small additional edit each time.
