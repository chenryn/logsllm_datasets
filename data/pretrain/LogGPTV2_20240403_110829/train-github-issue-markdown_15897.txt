In update #19113, we introduced basic support for adding a dependency from an iOS project to a module by manually configuring the dependency through the Xcode user interface. To improve this process, we should explore ways to simplify it. One potential approach is to delegate more of the configuration work to CocoaPods, thereby reducing the number of steps required to add a single pod reference.
