preserving tolling system in which drivers commit to the
path they drove without revealing the individual road seg-
ments. De Jonge and Jacobs’ system uses hash functions
for commitments, making it very efﬁcient. Only additive
road pricing functions are allowed (i.e., ones for which
the cost of driving along a path is the sum of the cost
of driving along each segment of the path); this makes
possible a protocol for verifying that the total fee was
correctly computed as the sum of each road segment price
by revealing, essentially, a path from the root to a single
leaf in a Merkle hash tree. (This constitutes a small infor-
mation leak.) In addition, de Jonge and Jacobs use spot
checks to verify that the driver faithfully reported each
road segment on which she drove.
More recently, Popa, Balakrishnan, and Blumberg pro-
posed the VPriv [39] privacy-preserving toll collection
system. VPriv takes advantage of the additive pricing
functions it supports to enable the use of homomorphic
commitments whereby the drivers commit to the prices
for each segment of their path as well as the sum of the
prices. Then, the product of the commitments is a com-
mitment of the sum of the prices. This eliminates the need
for a protocol to verify that the sum of segment prices
was computed correctly. Like previous systems, VPriv
uses (camera) spot checks to ensure that drivers faithfully
reveal the segments they drove. The downside to VPriv
is that, for the audit protocol, drivers must upload the
road segments they drove to the server; to avoid linking
these to their IP address, they must use an anonymizing
network such as Tor.
Balasch et al. proposed PrETP [4] to address some
of the shortcomings in VPriv. In PrETP, drivers do not
reveal the road segments they drove in the clear, and so do
not need an anonymizing network. Instead, they commit
to the segments and, using a homomorphic commitment
scheme, to the corresponding fees; in the audit protocol,
they open the commitments corresponding to the road
segments on which spot-check cameras observed them.
In each of the system of de Jonge and Jacobs, VPriv,
and PrETP, drivers are challenged in the audit protocol
to prove that they committed to or otherwise uploaded
the segments for which there is photographic evidence

that they were present. As discussed in Sections 1 and 2,
this revealing of camera locations enables several attacks
which allow drivers to pay less than their actual tolls.
Additionally, camera placement and tolling areas must be
restricted to ensure driver privacy, for example, by using
“virtual trip lines” [30].
In recent work, Hoepman and Huitema [29] observed
that in both VPriv and PrETP the audit protocol allows
the government to query cars about locations where there
was no camera, a capability that could be misused, for
example, to identify whistleblowers. They propose a
privacy-preserving tolling system in which vehicles can
be spot-checked only where their presence was actually
recorded, and in which overall driver privacy is guar-
anteed so long as the pricing provider and aggregation
provider do not collaborate. Like VPriv, Hoepman and
Huitema’s system requires road segments to be transmit-
ted from the car to the authority over an anonymizing
network.
Besides tolling, there are other vehicular applications
that require privacy guarantees; see, generally, Hubaux,
Cˇapkun, and Luo [31]. One important application is
vehicle-to-vehicle ad hoc safety networks [14]; see Freudi-
ger et al. [21] for one approach to location privacy in such
networks. Another important application is aggregate traf-
ﬁc data collection. Hoh et al. [30] propose “virtual trip
lines” that instruct cars to transmit their location infor-
mation and are placed to minimize privacy implications;
Rass et al. [40] give an alternative construction based on
cryptographic pseudonym systems.
Vehicle communication is one class of ubiquitous com-
puting system. Location privacy in ubiquitous computing
generally is a large and important research area; see the
recent survey by Krumm [33] for references.
8 Conclusions
In recent years, privacy-preserving toll collection has been
proposed as a way to implement more ﬁne-grained pricing
systems without having to sacriﬁce the privacy of drivers
using the roads. In such systems drivers do not reveal
their locations directly to the toll collection authorities;
this means there needs to be a mechanism in place to guar-
antee that the drivers are still reporting their accumulated
fees accurately and honestly. Maintaining this balance
between privacy and honesty in an efﬁcient and practical
way has proved to be a challenging problem; previous
work, however, such as the VPriv and PrETP systems, has
demonstrated that this problem is in fact tractable. Both
these systems employ modern cryptographic primitives
to allow the driver to convince the collection authority of
the accuracy of her payment without revealing any part of
her driving history. To go along with this collection mech-
anism, a series of random spot checks (i.e., the authority
challenging the driver to prove that she paid for segments
in which she was caught on camera) must be performed
in order to maintain honesty and fairness throughout the
system.
In this paper, we have identiﬁed large-scale driver col-
lusion as a realistic and damaging threat to the success
of privacy-preserving toll collection systems. To protect
against these sorts of collusions, we have presented Milo,
a system which achieves the same privacy properties as
VPriv and PrETP, but strengthens the guarantee of driver
honesty by avoiding revealing camera locations to drivers.
We have also implemented the new parts of our system to
show that achieving this stronger security guarantee does
not add an impractical burden to any party acting within
the system.
Finally, along more practical lines, we have consid-
ered a naïve approach to protecting against collusions and
shown that, from both a cost and effectiveness considera-
tion, it is ultimately less desirable and more cumbersome
than Milo.
The weaknesses we identify in previous systems are
caused by the gap between the assumption made by
the cryptographic protocols (that spot checks are unpre-
dictable) and the real-world cameras used to implement
them — cameras that are physical objects that can be iden-
tiﬁed and may be difﬁcult to move. If drivers are able to
avoid some cameras, more of them will be required; if
too many spot-check cameras are deployed, the records
they generate will themselves degrade driver privacy. We
believe that it is important for work on privacy-preserving
tolling to address this limitation by carefully considering
how the spot checks it relies on will be implemented.
