### Privacy-Preserving Toll Collection Systems

**Introduction to Privacy-Preserving Tolling Systems**

Privacy-preserving toll collection systems aim to implement fine-grained pricing without compromising the privacy of drivers. These systems ensure that drivers do not reveal their exact locations or driving paths, while still allowing for accurate and fair toll collection. This balance between privacy and honesty is a challenging but tractable problem, as demonstrated by several recent systems.

**de Jonge and Jacobs' System**

One early system, proposed by de Jonge and Jacobs, uses hash functions to commit to the path driven without revealing individual road segments. The system supports only additive pricing functions, where the total cost is the sum of the costs of each segment. Verification is achieved through a Merkle hash tree, where a path from the root to a leaf can be revealed to confirm the total fee. Spot checks are used to verify that drivers accurately report the segments they drove. However, this method has a small information leak due to the nature of the verification process.

**VPriv System**

More recently, Popa, Balakrishnan, and Blumberg introduced VPriv, which leverages homomorphic commitments. Drivers commit to the prices for each segment and the sum of these prices. The product of these commitments serves as a commitment to the total price, eliminating the need for a separate protocol to verify the sum. VPriv also uses spot checks, but requires drivers to upload the road segments they drove to a server, necessitating the use of an anonymizing network like Tor to protect their IP addresses.

**PrETP System**

Balasch et al. proposed PrETP to address some of the shortcomings of VPriv. In PrETP, drivers do not reveal the road segments they drove in plain text, thus avoiding the need for an anonymizing network. Instead, they commit to the segments and the corresponding fees using a homomorphic commitment scheme. During audits, drivers open the commitments for the segments observed by spot-check cameras.

**Common Challenges and Solutions**

In all these systems—de Jonge and Jacobs, VPriv, and PrETP—drivers must prove during audits that they committed to or uploaded the segments for which there is photographic evidence. This can lead to attacks if camera locations are revealed, as discussed in earlier sections. To mitigate this, camera placement and tolling areas must be restricted, and "virtual trip lines" can be used to minimize privacy implications.

**Recent Developments: Hoepman and Huitema's System**

Hoepman and Huitema observed that both VPriv and PrETP allow the government to query cars about locations without cameras, potentially misused to identify whistleblowers. They propose a system where vehicles can be spot-checked only where their presence was recorded, ensuring overall driver privacy as long as the pricing and aggregation providers do not collude. Like VPriv, their system requires road segments to be transmitted over an anonymizing network.

**Other Vehicular Applications Requiring Privacy**

Beyond tolling, other vehicular applications require privacy guarantees. For example, vehicle-to-vehicle ad hoc safety networks and aggregate traffic data collection. Hoh et al. propose "virtual trip lines" to minimize privacy implications, while Rass et al. suggest using cryptographic pseudonym systems.

**Conclusion**

Privacy-preserving toll collection systems have made significant progress, but large-scale driver collusion remains a realistic threat. To address this, we present Milo, a system that achieves the same privacy properties as VPriv and PrETP while strengthening the guarantee of driver honesty by not revealing camera locations. We have implemented the new parts of our system to show that achieving this stronger security does not add an impractical burden. Additionally, we consider a naive approach to protecting against collusions and show that it is less desirable and more cumbersome than Milo.
