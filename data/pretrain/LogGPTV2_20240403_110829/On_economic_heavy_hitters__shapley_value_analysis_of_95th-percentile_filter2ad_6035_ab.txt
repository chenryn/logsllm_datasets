unfeasible once N becomes greater than 100. For APs with
thousands (or millions) of subscribers such exact compu-
tation is not possible. In this Section we describe a simple
randomized method for approximating the Shapley, that can
scale with datasets of tens of thousands (if not millions) of
subscribers.
The idea of the method is simple. The Shapley value of
user i deﬁned by (1) can be seen as the marginal cost in-
crease by user i, averaged over all N ! arrival orders. In the
example from Section 1.1, N = 2 and there are 2 arrival
orders: π1 = (1, 2) and π2 = (2, 1) and the user 1 and user

((v({1, 2}) − v({1})) + (v({2}) − v(∅))) =

While computing the exact Shapley value through the for-
mula (1) is straightforward for small N , it becomes unfeasi-
ble for N > 50, as the number of diﬀerent permutation or-
ders grows with N !. However, the computational complex-
ity can be signiﬁcantly reduced by using the Monte Carlo
method.
Instead of calculating the exact Shapley value as the av-
erage cost contribution across all N ! arrival orders, we es-
timate the Shapley value as the average cost contribution
Thus the Shapley value estimator (2) is unbiased. How-
ever the variance of the estimator is hard to model and in
Section 3.2 we present empirical evidence that for reason-
ably small sample size (say, k = 1000) the estimator exhibits
small variance, especially for the top users.

3. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
In this section we present the empirical results obtained
by analyzing the dataset of around 10K broadband users
of a major European ISP. In Section 3.1 we describe the
dataset, then in Section 3.2 we analyze the accuracy of the
randomized method for calculating Shapley value. We pro-
ceed by analyzing the correlation between per-user aggregate
usage and its Shapley value in Section 3.3 and then in Sec-
tion 3.4 we quantify the relative cost of bandwidth in time
that would best approximate the Shapley value. Additional
empirical results, related to the consistency of the Shapley
value over time, as well as additional discussion on the rela-
tive cost of bandwidth, can be found in the Technical report
[21].
3.1 Dataset description
The dataset consists of around 10K ADSL users of a ma-
jor access provider in one European country. For each cus-
tomer, its downstream and upstream consumption (in bytes)
is captured during each hour for 30 days (thus spanning 720
hours). These users represent a random sample of ADSL
users of the ISP and have diverse uplink/downlink capacities
in the ranges of 256Kbps–10Mbps, and 1Mbps–20Mbps, re-
spectively. The downstream traﬃc dominates the upstream
traﬃc in the ratio 4 : 1, which is consistent with the re-
cent ﬁndings from another European access provider ISP
[15]. Virtually all ADSL users from the dataset pay ﬂat-
fee, without incentives to shift their traﬃc to the oﬀ-peak
hours[11]. We stress that the empirical results derived from
this dataset are mainly qualitative, used for the purpose of
validating the Shapley value methodology and basic proper-
ties of Shapley value, and results derived here should not be
generalized for other types of environments such as campus,
backbone or enterprize networks.

Figure 3: Standard error as a function of number of
sample permutations (parameter k).
For the computation of 95th-percentile we use 1-hour bins,
as this is the granularity of our dataset. Given that we
consider large traﬃc volumes and large number of users,
using diﬀerent bin sizes (e.g. 5 minutes) would have minor
eﬀects on the 95th-percentile [8].
As we said, the downstream traﬃc dominates the up-
stream and in the following analysis we will therefore focus
on the downstream traﬃc, as it is the direction that deter-
mines the 95th-percentile (see Appendix A). The dataset
does not distinguish the per-user share of transit/nontransit
traﬃc, so for the evaluation purposes we assume that all the
traﬃc contributes to the 95th-percentile.
3.2 Accuracy of the Shapley value estimator
Our ﬁrst step is the evaluation of the accuracy of the Shap-
ley value estimator (2). Given that we do not have the
ground truth measurement, to evaluate the error that the
estimator exhibits, we use the standard statistical method
as follows. Recall that the Shapley value estimator (2) of
user i is a mean of k samples of marginal cost contribu-
tions v(S(π, i)) − v(S(π, i) \ i). If we denote by ˆσi the esti-
mated standard deviation of the same k marginal cost sam-
ples. Then the relative standard error of the estimator (2)
ˆσi√
is
k ˆφi(v) . In Figure 2 we plot the histograms of these stan-

Shapley value.
dard errors when the sample size is k = 1000 permutations3
for all users as well as the users with Shapley value estimate
higher than the mean Shapley value 1/N·v(N ). One can ob-
serve that the relative standard errors are moderately small
across all users and are consistently under 10% for top users.
In Figure 3 we vary the number of sample permutation or-
ders (parameter k) and evaluate the relative standard errors
averaged across all the users and also the top 15% users.
3.3 Aggregate usage vs. Shapley value
Now, that we established the accuracy of Shapley value
estimates, we will compare it with the time-oblivious us-
age measure: bytes downloaded over the whole 30-day pe-
riod (byte-counters). In Figure 4 we plot the normalized4
Shapley value (x-axis) against the normalized byte-counters
(y-axis) for each user from our dataset. Users with rela-
tively high oﬀ-peak usage correspond to datapoints that are
far above x − y = 0 line. Conversely, users with modest
oﬀ-peak usage and heavy “peak-hour” usage correspond to
datapoints close to x-axis. Finally, the more similar the us-
age activity of a user is to the aggregate usage pattern, the
closer its datapoint is to the x − y = 0 line. To measure
how diﬀerent the user’s Shapley value and byte-count are
we introduce the following metric that basically measures
the discrepancy between the user’s relative aggregate usage
and its relative contribution to the 95th-percentile:
ρi =
normalized Shapley value of user i
normalized byte-count of user i
, i ∈ N .
As we said above, the users with high oﬀ-peak usage (com-
pared to their peak-usage) have low ρi and vice versa. In
Figure 5 we plot the histogram of ρi for all users i with Shap-
ley value greater than the mean (approx 15% of the users)
as we have a high conﬁdence in the measured Shapley value
for those users (see Figure 2). We see that there are ap-
