User: I have a RESTful API like /do/some/<action:.*> so my app with get <action> and run it. 
My question is, if I use RedirectRoute and strict_slash=True, will my app keep getting <action> as argument or will it start getting <action>/ (notice the / at the end)?
EDIT: I'm using webapp2
Assistant: A RedirectRoute will issue a HTTP redirect telling the browser to go to the new URL, then the browser will make a new request at that URL.
How this is implemented is that two routes are created - your original route, and one for redirecting.
So, in your case, a route with /do/some/<action:.*>/ would be created that redirects to /do/some/<action.*>.
However, I think your route actually will be checked first (not positive, sorry), so it would just always fire. I would modify it to not match slashes, if that's okay. Luckily, that's the default behaviour if you omit the regex, so just /do/some/<action:> should work!
