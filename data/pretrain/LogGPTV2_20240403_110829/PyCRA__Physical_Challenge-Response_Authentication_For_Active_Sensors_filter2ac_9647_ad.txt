to react. We evaluated the PyCRA detection scheme across a range
of τattack values, χ2 detection thresholds (α), and sampling fre-
quencies (Fs). Note that in order to simulate an attacker with 0
ms physical delays (which is physically impossible), we gave the
attacker access to the random signal generated by PyCRA so that
the attacker can start shutting down his actuators before PyCRA
generates the physical challenge.
In total, we conducted over 30 experiments on our experimental
testbed to validate the robustness of the proposed security scheme.
The resulting accuracy with Fs = 10 kHz is depicted by the ROC2
curves in Figure 8a for a range of α. From this ﬁgure it is clear that
between τattack = 500 and 700 µs is all that is necessary for PyCRA
to accurately distinguish attacked signals from normal signals, if
α is chosen appropriately. With α set to a predetermined value,
we can vary Fs as shown in Figure 8b3. These results show that
increasing Fs from 10 kHz to 30 kHz reduces required time for
detection to between τattack = 100 and 200 µs.
Repeating these experiments for the advanced spooﬁng attack
[T3] yields similar results. In fact, there is no fundamental differ-
ence between the two in terms of attack detection; this is governed
by the dynamics of the attacker’s actuator rather than the nature of
the attack itself.
It is important to evaluate this detection accuracy (which is our
security guarantee) in terms of the physical delay property τattack of
the attacker model. In practice, the state-of-the-art in low-dimension,
high Q-factor hardware that provide enough power to carry out a
spooﬁng attack will have τ (cid:29) 200µs4. From Figure 8b it is appar-
ent that PyCRA has good performance for this range of practical
physical delays.
Moreover, the results we have shown thus far use a relatively low
sampling frequency (high end micro controllers can operate in the
range of 200 kHz). As illustrated by Figure 8b, higher sampling

6. CASE STUDY (2): DETECTION OF PAS-
SIVE EAVESDROPPING ON RFID
In this section, we discuss detection of passive eavesdropping
attacks on active sensors. In this scenario, an adversary listens or
records the same physical signals captured by the sensor. Indeed
this type of attack satisﬁes assumptions A1–A3 described in Sec-
tion 3 and hence it will be useful to extend PyCRA to such cases.
6.1 Passive Eavesdropping on RFID
In this section, we use radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) as
an example where successful passive attacks can have severe con-
sequences. RFID systems are commonly used to control access
to physical places and to track the location of certain objects. An
RFID system consists of two parts: a reader and a tag. The RFID
reader continuously sends a magnetic signal that probes for exist-
ing tags in the near proximity. Once a tag enters the proximity of
the reader, the tag starts to send its “unique” identiﬁer to the reader
by modulating the magnetic probe signal.
RFID tags can be classiﬁed as either passive or active based on
the source of their energy. While passive tags rely on the energy
transmitted by an RFID reader in order to power their electron-
ics, active tags have their own power supplies. As a result, active
tags can be equipped with computational platforms that run crypto-
graphic and security protocols to mitigate cloning attacks [5]. On
the other hand, passive tags do not enjoy these luxuries and there-
fore are more prone to cloning attacks.
Cloning of passive RFID tags can take place in one of two forms.
In the ﬁrst, the attacker uses a mobile RFID reader and attempts to
place it near the RFID tag. The tag innocently responds to the com-
munication issued by the adversarial reader and sends its unique
identiﬁer. The other form of attack carried out against RFID sys-
tems is to eavesdrop on the communication between the tag and
a legitimate reader. RFID protective shields and blockers [27, 15]
are commonly used as countermeasure to the ﬁrst form of cloning
attacks discussed above. Unfortunately, these shields are of no use

against the second type of attacks, because the user is obliged to re-
move the protective shield before using the tag with the legitimate
RFID reader, at which time an adversary can successfully eaves-
drop.
To carry out an eavesdropping attack, a snifﬁng device must be
placed in close proximity to the RFID reader so that it can measure
the electromagnetic waves transmitted by the reader and reﬂected
by the tag. In the following results, we show how PyCRA is able to
detect the existence of such an attack, allowing the reader to disable
communication with the tag before revealing private information.
6.2 Using PyCRA to Detect Eavesdroppers
Recall from the physics of electromagnetic waves that antennas
placed within close proximity will always affect each other’s elec-
trical signals to some degree. This is a fundamental law in physics
known as magnetic coupling [2] and is used in the design of RFID.
Note that, similar to the physical delays, the magnetic coupling as-
sumption is a fundamental limitation that the attacker cannot over-
come. Hence, we can use the PyCRA detection algorithm outlined
in Section 3 by computing the residual between the model (which
assumes magnetic coupling only with the RFID tag) and the sensor
output which suffers from magnetic coupling with the eavesdrop-
ping antenna. This is shown in the experimental results in the next
subsection.
6.3 Hardware Setup and Real-time Results
Figure 9 shows the hardware setup used to carry out this case-
study. In this setup, two identical low frequency RFID antennas are
used. The ﬁrst RFID antenna is used as the legitimate RFID reader
while the second is used to eavesdrop. We built a PyCRA-enabled
RFID reader on top of the open source RFID Proxmark3 board,
adding random modulation to the probing signal and constructing
the appropriate models as outlined in Section 3.
Figure 10a (top) shows the received electromagnetic wave of an
RFID reader operating in the classical operational mode. In this
mode, the RFID reader generates the standard 125KHz sinusoidal
wave that is used to communicate with the RFID tag. Figure 10a
(middle) shows the resulting electromagnetic wave when an eaves-
dropper uses an identical antenna to listen. In this case it is hard
to distinguish between the two waves and hence hard to detect the
existence of an eavesdropper. This is better illustrated by the resid-
ual between the two waves as shown by the residual in Figure 10a
(bottom).
On the other hand, Figures 10b and 10c show the result of the
same case study when PyCRA is used with and without an eaves-
dropper present, respectively. In this mode, the PyCRA algorithm
occasionally halts the normal operation of the RFID reader and
switches to detection mode. In this mode, PyCRA selects random-
ized periods of time to issue the physical challenges by switching
the RFID antenna from on to off and from off to on.
In order to select an appropriate alarm threshold, we ﬁrst study
the effect of the magnetic coupling between the reader and the tag
in the absence of an eavesdropper. This is shown in Figure 10b
where the alarm threshold is chosen such that no alarm is triggered
when the effect of the magnetic coupling—the residual between the
“no tag” response (top) and the response with a tag (middle)—is
within the acceptable range. This acceptable residual range allows
for coupling induced by the tag only. Any increase on top of this al-
lowable threshold is then attributed to the existence of an excessive
magnetic coupling due to an eavesdropper.
Figure 10c (middle) shows the response to the same set of phys-
ical challenges when the attacker places an eavesdropping antenna
in the proximity of the RFID reader while the tag is also present.
Thanks to the physical challenge produced by PyCRA, the mag-
netic coupling produced by the eavesdropper antenna is now easily
detected. This can be shown in Figure 10c (bottom) which shows
the residuals between the expected output and the measured signal
exceeding the alarm threshold.
We recorded over 1 hour of RFID measurements with varying
distances of the malicious eavesdropping antenna. Of those exper-
iments where the attacker was close enough to observe the RFID
communication, PyCRA successfully detected the existence of an

Intuitively, if the attacker success-
fully measures the RFID signal, he has consequently removed enough
energy from the channel to trigger an alarm.
7. CASE STUDY (3): EXTENDING PYCRA
FOR ATTACK RESILIENCE
In some scenarios it is possible to extend the PyCRA authentica-
tion system to provide attack resilience as well. Here the goal is to
design a sensor whose estimate of a physical phenomenon remains
robust in the face of a range of physical attacks. One way to mit-
igate the effects of an attack is by characterizing the attack signal
during the confusion phase, when the attacking signal remains de-
tectable for τattack. This characterization depends on the properties
of the sensor and signals in question, but it is in general made eas-
ier if the attack signal is sparse in some domain. One such attack
resilience scheme for magnetic encoders is described below.
The signal reﬂected by a magnetic encoder’s tone ring is a si-
nusoidal wave dominated by a single frequency component. If we
consider the frequency domain representation of the measured sig-
nal over a window, we expect to see the energy concentrated at
one frequency corresponding to that of the tone ring. However, in
the existence of an attacker and using Fourier analysis, we can rea-
sonably expect to observe energy concentrated at multiple frequen-
cies. The sensor must be able to distinguish between the correct
frequency and those of the attacker. If the attack signal itself is rea-
sonably sparse in some domain—e.g., the Fourier domain in this
example—we may obtain an accurate model of that signal over a
short time period, aided by the confusion period and delay τattack.
For example, we can use our earlier χ2 estimator as an attack indi-
cator for any given frequency component using the recursive Dis-
crete Fourier Transform (DFT) with the following form:
Yk(t + 1) = e( j2πk/N)Yk(t) + e(− j2πk(N−1)/N)y(t)
− e( j2πk/N)y(t − N)
(5)
where Yk(t) ∈ CN is the kth component of the N-point DFT of the
sensor output y(t) at time t ∈ N0. The χ2 detector uses the sensor
(in the case of no attack) denoted(cid:98)Yk(t). We deﬁne the χ2 residual
model along with (5) to predict the natural response of the tone gear
in the frequency domain as Zk(t) = |Yk(t)|−|(cid:98)Yk(t)|, allowing us to
deﬁne thresholds to again indicate when an attack is detected and,
now, the nature of that attack in terms of its its frequency compo-
nents.
We implemented the scheme described above and again tested
against a number of spooﬁng attacks in more than 90 experiments.
Figure 11a illustrates the result of these experiments for a swept
frequency attack, where the malicious (red) signal is accurately de-
tected and therefore easily subtracted from the measured signal,
providing a more robust estimate of the signal of interest. Figure
11b shows the accuracy of this prediction in terms of true and false
positive rates as a function of τattack. Here we demonstrate accu-
rate attack characterization and mitigation even for τattack delays
as low as 5 ms. In addition, the PyCRA-secured magnetic encoder
remains robust even in the face of an active cancellation spooﬁng
attack, where the attacker attempts to use destructive interference
to destroy the signal of interest. Again, during the confusion pe-
riod we can actively characterize the attack signal and subtract its
effects.
8. DISCUSSION
We have shown that PyCRA is able to detect and possibly mit-
igate different attacks on physical signals. In this section, we pro-

vide some distilled discussion thrusts by comparing PyCRA to the
existing literature, revisiting the connection between physics and
security guarantees and the effect of using PyCRA on the overall
system performance.
8.1 Comparison With Literature
We can classify previous work on secure sensing based on the
redundancy needed to provide security. For example the work de-
scribed in [7, 30, 35] provides security through network and sen-
sor redundancy. Additional research has explored fusing redun-
dant measurements to provide secure localization [32, 21] and se-
cure time synchronization [24]. The work presented in this paper
falls within a second category in which no redundancy is needed
to provide security. Indeed, providing security using single mea-
surements is complementary to the security guarantees provided
by redundancy based techniques. We can further classify this cate-
gory into two subcategories depending on the dependency of cryp-
tographic constructs. As described in previous sections, crypto-
graphic constructs fail to counteract active attacks taking place in
the analog domain—a gap for which PyCRA has been designed and
implemented. While PyCRA is novel in bringing security against
active attacks on sensory data in the analog domain, there exist
similar ideas in the literature for other types of active attacks. For
