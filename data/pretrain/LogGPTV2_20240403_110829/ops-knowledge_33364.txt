User: How to automate the deployment of a web server using Ansible? Please provide Ansible Playbook and related commands.
Assistant: The following is an example Ansible Playbook for automating the deployment of a web server: ``` --- hosts: webserver remote_user: root tasks: - name: Install Apache apt: name: apache2 state: present - name: Start Apache service service : name: apache2 state: started - name: Copy web files copy: src: /path/to/files dest: /var/www/html/ ``` There are three tasks in this Playbook: 1. Install the Apache package. 2. Start the Apache service. 3. Copy the web files to the default website directory in the server. To run this playbook, first create an inventory file called "hosts" on your Ansible control machine that contains the target hosts where you want to install the web server. Here is the command to run on the control machine: ``` ansible-playbook -i hosts webserver.yml ``` where "hosts" is the name of your inventory file and "webserver.yml" is the name of the Playbook to run .
