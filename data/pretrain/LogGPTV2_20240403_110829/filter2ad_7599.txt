1.  INTRODUCTION 
The  Internet  has  been  changing  from  transferring  text  data  to 
multimedia data since the past years. The multimedia applications 
are sensitive to packet losses. Packet losses are mainly due to link 
overload  and  failures.  For  safeguarding  against  failures,  the 
backup routing is needed. Accordingly, we call the routing for the 
normal  data  transferring  the  primary  routing.  For  avoiding  link 
overload, TE (Traffic Engineering) is needed. The solution to TE 
is typically  formulated to minimize the  maximum link utilization 
(MLU). We call the MLU before a failure the normal-state MLU. 
If  a  failure  occurs,  the  backup  routes  against  the  failure  will  be 
invoked. The invoked backup routes have been working until the 
new primary routes are re-computed on the new topology. We call 
the MLU during the backup routes work the transition-state MLU. 
To  our  knowledge,  the  existing  predict-based  TE  methods 
optimize 
routing 
independently and in this paper it is the first time to optimize both 
the primary routing and the backup routing based on predicted TE.  
the  primary 
routing  and 
the  backup 
The primary routing is intrinsically linked with the backup routing, 
so in this paper we propose a unified approach, called Unified TE 
(UTE), to together optimizing the primary routing and the backup 
routing  for  both  the  normal-state  MLU  and  the  transition-state 
MLU  as  a  whole.  The  emerging  Openflow-MPLS  [1]  provides 
convenient  deployment  conditions  for  UTE.  The  difficulty  of 
UTE  is  that  the  optimal  normal-state  MLU  and  the  optimal 
transition-state  MLU  cannot  be  always  simultaneously  achieved. 
We  now  take  an  example.  Figure  1  is  a  topology  where  the 
bandwidth of each link is 100. Table 1 shows the traffic demands 
and the routes on the topology in Figure 1. ‘S1’ and ‘S2’ in Table 
1  denote  two  routing  schemes.  In  Scheme  1,  the  normal-state 
MLU  is  0.6,  which  is  a  minimum,  but  the  transition-state  MLU 
when Link C-E fails is 1.2, leading to link overload. In Scheme 2,

the transition-state MLU is decreased to 0.9, which is a minimum, 
but  the  normal-state  MLU  is  increased  to  0.8.  The  both  states  of 
TE performance are important as follows. Although the  sum  time 
during the transition-state period is much shorter than that during 
the normal-state period, the good transition-state TE performance 
is  very  important because  the  probability  of  link  overload during 
the  transition-state  period  is  much  higher  than  that  during  the 
normal-state  period.  Even  though  that,  the  good  normal-state  TE 
performance  is  still  very  important  because  if  a  network  often 
maintains a low MLU, the network operators can delay to upgrade 
the  network  infrastructure.  How  to  achieve  a  reasonable  tradeoff 
is a promising but challenge problem. In this paper, we study the 
mathematical 
the  normal-state  TE 
performance and the transition-state TE performance. As an early 
stage of this work, we only sketch up the ideas of doing tradeoffs. 
In  the  future,  we  will  develop  the  practical  and  flexible  tradeoff 
system. For better understanding the impact of the primary routing 
on  the  backup  routing,  we  compare  UTE  with  the  separate  TE. 
The separate TE works as follows. The optimal primary routing is 
first  computed  and  the  optimal  backup  routing  based  on  the 
computed  optimal  primary  routing 
then  computed.  For 
comparison fairness,  we let UTE use such  a strategy,  which is to 
make 
the  normal-state  TE  performance  optimal.  Using 
simulations,  we  find  that  UTE  using  such  a  strategy  can  achieve 
better  transition-state  TE  performance  than  the  separate  TE. 
Because the number of the optimal primary routings is enormous, 
the  separate  TE  will  arbitrarily  select  an  optimal  primary  routing 
while UTE will select the optimal primary routing that makes the 
backup  routing  best  among  all  the  optimal  primary  routings.  It 
implies that the primary routing does have a significant impact on 
the backup routing in the aspect of TE. 
is 
In  this  paper,  we  only  consider  the  protection  against  single  link 
failures  because  [2]  shows  that  70%  failures  are  single  link 
failures. In the future, we will consider the protection against the 
single  router  failures  and  multiple  failures.  At  present,  UTE  uses 
the  pro-active  TE  as  the  TE  module,  i.e.  computing  routes  based 
on  a  given  topology  and  a  given  traffic  matrix,  which  can  be 
obtained from the past history. UTE uses the bypass restoration as 
the  failure  restoration  module,  i.e.  once  a  failure  is  locally 
detected,  the  affected  traffic  will  be  detoured  around  the  failure.  
BECADBECAD553Besides  the  pro-active  TE  and  the  bypass  restoration,  there  are 
reactive  TE  and  path-level  restoration.  In  the  future,  we  will 
explore  other  combinations  of  unified  approaches.  We  suppose 
that the capacity of each link is symmetric in this paper.  
2.  APPROACH 
In this section, we will describe our unified TE approach, UTE. In 
addition,  we  study  the  mathematical  relationship  between  the 
normal-state  TE  performance  and 
transition-state  TE 
performance.  In  this  section,   denotes  a  topology;   denotes  a 
traffic  matrix;   denotes  a  primary  routing;   denotes  a  backup 
routing.

The  normal-state  TE  performance  ratio  of  X  on     and     is 
denoted  by   (       ),  which  is  equal  to  the  ratio  of  the  MLU 
achieved by X on   and   to the optimal MLU on   and  . 
We  let   (             ) be  the  ratio  of  the  MLU  achieved  by   
and   on   and   in  the  transition-state  period  of  the  single  link 
failure F to the optimal MLU on the new topology removing the 
failed link F from   and  . 
The  transition-state  TE  performance  ratio  of  a  primary  routing   
and a backup routing Y on   and   is:

The objective of UTE is to minimize   (          ), where   and 
  are given constants,   and   are variables.  The problem can be 
formulated  as  a  linear  programming  (LP)  model  as  shown  in 
Table  2.  The  LP  problem  can  be  solved  in  polynomial  time.  We 
refer  readers  to  the  technical  report  [3]  for  the  specified 
formulation  of  the  LP  model.  In  our  LP  model,  we  suppose  that 
the link failure is bidirectional.

We let   be the optimal value of the objective in the LP model of 
UTE.   Obviously,  given     and    ,     can  be  represented  as  a 
function of   in Table 2. We let the function be         ( ), where

3.  EVALUATION 
In  this  section,  we  will  compare  UTE  with  the  separate  TE.  We 
obtained  the  real  topology  and  real  traffic  matrices  from  the 
Abilene network [5]. The topology has 12 nodes and 30 links. The 
traffic matrices are collected every five minutes from 2003-03-01 
to  2003-09-10.  We  use  the  traffic  matrix  in  the  last  5-minite 
interval to compute the primary and backup routing for the current 
5-minite interval. The ratio of the MLU achieved by using the last 
past  traffic  matrix  to  the  theoretical  limit  achieved  by  using  the 
current  traffic  matrix  is  called  the  TE  performance  ratio.  We 
computed  the  normal-state  and  the  transition-state  performance 
ratios  for  UTE  and  the  separate  TE.  The  comparison  results  are 
shown in Figure 2 (a) and (b). The vertical coordinates in Figure 2 
denote  the  CDF  (Cumulative  Distribution  Function)  of  the 
performance ratios. We find that the UTE and the separate TE has 
nearly  the  same  results  in  the  aspect  of  the  normal-state 
performance.  In  addition,  most  of  the  normal-state  performance 
ratios  are  very  close  to  1,  which  implies  that  pro-active  TE  is 
effective.  In  the  aspect  of  the  transition-state  performance,  UTE 
has much better performance than the separate TE. 
4.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In  this  paper,  we  build  a  LP  model  to  optimizing  the  primary 
routing and the backup routing as a whole for TE. In addition, we 
explore  the  mathematical  relationship  between  the  normal-state 
TE  performance  and  the  transition-state  TE  performance.  In  the 
future,  we  will  develop  a  reasonable  tradeoff  system  for  the 
normal-state  and  transition-state  TE  performance  based  on  their 
practical significances and their mathematical characteristics.
