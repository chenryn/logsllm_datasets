### Title: Embracing Our New Power Analysis Overlords

Despite some high-profile failures, it is clear that embedded security is improving. However, several significant challenges remain, including side-channel attacks and fault attacks. These threats are often poorly understood, and determining their relevance to a specific target requires complex analysis. This talk introduces a new open-source tool, ChipWhisperer-Lint, designed to address at least one of these challenges. 

ChipWhisperer-Lint can be used in conjunction with the open-source ChipWhisperer hardware to fully automate the detection of power analysis attacks on a wide range of devices. The initial version of the tool supports the AES algorithm and has been demonstrated to identify vulnerabilities in five microcontrollers with AES hardware acceleration, which were previously thought to be secure.

These findings highlight the potential for products relying on encryption to protect critical secrets to be easily compromised, as seen in the Philips Hue attack. ChipWhisperer-Lint builds on Colin's previous work, making power analysis attacks accessible to all engineers through open-source hardware and software. This latest tool represents a significant step forward in both accessibility and ease of use, as it eliminates the need for users to have a deep understanding of how the attacks work.

With this tool, there is no longer any excuse for using insecure devices in your products. Identifying specific side-channel power analysis vulnerabilities can now be accomplished in just a few minutes across a wide range of embedded devices.
