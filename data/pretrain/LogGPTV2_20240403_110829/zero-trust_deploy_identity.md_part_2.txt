### III. Analytics improve visibility
As you build your estate in Microsoft Entra ID with authentication, authorization, and provisioning, it's important to have strong operational insights into what is happening in the directory.
#### Configure your logging and reporting to improve visibility
Take this step:
 - [Plan a Microsoft Entra reporting and monitoring deployment](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/plan-monitoring-and-reporting) to be able to persist and analyze logs from Microsoft Entra ID, either in Azure or using a SIEM system of choice.
[!INCLUDE [H2 heading, Additional deployment objectives](../includes/deployment-objectives-additional.md)]
### IV. Identities and access privileges are managed with identity governance
Once you've accomplished your initial three objectives, you can focus on additional objectives such as more robust identity governance.

#### Secure privileged access with Privileged Identity Management
Control the endpoints, conditions, and credentials that users use to access privileged operations/roles.
Follow these steps:
1.  [Take control of your privileged identities](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-admin-roles-secure). Keep in mind that in a digitally-transformed organization, privileged access is not only administrative access, but also application owner or developer access that can change the way your mission-critical apps run and handle data.
2.  [Use Privileged Identity Management to secure privileged identities](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan).
#### Restrict user consent to applications
User consent to applications is a very common way for modern applications to get access to organizational resources, but there are some best practices to keep in mind.
Follow these steps:
1.  [Restrict user consent and manage consent requests](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-consent-requests) to ensure that no unnecessary exposure occurs of your organization's data to apps.
2.  [Review prior/existing consent in your organization](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/detect-and-remediate-illicit-consent-grants?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) for any excessive or malicious consent.
For more on tools to protect against tactics to access sensitive information, see "Strengthen protection against cyber threats and rogue apps" in our [guide to implementing an identity Zero Trust strategy](https://aka.ms/ZTIdentity).
#### Manage entitlement
With applications centrally authenticating and driven from Microsoft Entra ID, you can now streamline your access request, approval, and recertification process to make sure that the right people have the right access and that you have a trail of why users in your organization have the access they have.
Follow these steps:
1.  Use Entitlement Management to [create access packages](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create) that users can request as they join different teams/projects and that assigns them access to the associated resources (such as applications, SharePoint sites, group memberships).
2.  If deploying Entitlement Management is not possible for your organization at this time, at least enable self-service paradigms in your organization by deploying [self-service group management](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-self-service-management) and [self-service application access](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-self-service-access).
#### Use passwordless authentication to reduce the risk of phishing and password attacks
With Microsoft Entra ID supporting FIDO 2.0 and passwordless phone sign-in, you can move the needle on the credentials that your users (especially sensitive/privileged users) are employing day-to-day. These credentials are strong authentication factors that can mitigate risk as well.
Take this step:
 - [Start rolling out passwordless credentials](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment) in your organization.
### V. User, device, location, and behavior is analyzed in real time to determine risk and deliver ongoing protection
Real-time analysis is critical for determining risk and protection.
:::image type="content" source="../media/diagram-steps-box-identity-5.png" alt-text="Diagram of the steps within phase 5 of the additional deployment objectives." border="true":::
#### Deploy Microsoft Entra Password Protection
While enabling other methods to verify users explicitly, don't ignore weak passwords, password spray, and breach replay attacks. And [classic complex password policies do not prevent the most prevalent password attacks](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984).
Take this step:
 - Enable Microsoft Entra Password Protection for your users [in the cloud](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad) and [on-premises](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-ban-bad-on-premises-deploy).
#### Enable Identity Protection
Get more granular session/user risk signal with Identity Protection. You'll be able to investigate risk and confirm compromise or dismiss the signal, which will help the engine better understand what risk looks like in your environment.
Take this step:
- [Enable Identity Protection](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection).
#### Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps integration with Identity Protection
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps monitors user behavior inside SaaS and modern applications. This informs Microsoft Entra ID about what happened to the user after they authenticated and received a token. If the user pattern starts to look suspicious (e.g., a user starts to download gigabytes of data from OneDrive or starts to send spam emails in Exchange Online), then a signal can be fed to Microsoft Entra ID notifying it that the user seems to be compromised or high risk. On the next access request from this user, Microsoft Entra ID can correctly take action to verify the user or block them.
Take this step:
- [Enable Defender for Cloud Apps monitoring](/cloud-app-security/azip-integration) to enrich the Identity Protection signal.
#### Enable Conditional Access integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
Using signals emitted after authentication and with Defender for Cloud Apps proxying requests to applications, you will be able to monitor sessions going to SaaS applications and enforce restrictions.
Follow these steps:
1.  [Enable Conditional Access integration](/cloud-app-security/proxy-intro-aad).
2.  [Extend Conditional Access to on-premises apps](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-integrate-with-microsoft-cloud-application-security).
#### Enable restricted session for use in access decisions
When a user's risk is low, but they are signing in from an unknown endpoint, you may want to allow them access to critical resources, but not allow them to do things that leave your organization in a noncompliant state. Now you can configure Exchange Online and SharePoint Online to offer the user a restricted session that allows them to read emails or view files, but not download them and save them on an untrusted device.
Take this step:
 - Enable limited access to [SharePoint Online](https://aka.ms/spolimitedaccessdocs) and [Exchange Online](https://aka.ms/owalimitedaccess)
### VI. Integrate threat signals from other security solutions to improve detection, protection, and response
Finally, other security solutions can be integrated for greater effectiveness.
#### Integrate Microsoft Defender for Identity with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
Integration with Microsoft Defender for Identity enables Microsoft Entra ID to know that a user is indulging in risky behavior while accessing on-premises, non-modern resources (like File Shares). This can then be factored into overall user risk to block further access in the cloud.
Follow these steps:
1. [Enable Microsoft Defender for Identity](/cloud-app-security/aatp-integration) with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to bring on-premises signals into the risk signal we know about the user.
2. Check the [combined Investigation Priority score](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/enterprise-mobility-security/introducing-investigation-priority-built-on-user-and-entity/ba-p/360853) for each user at risk to give a holistic view of which ones your SOC should focus on.
#### Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint allows you to attest to the health of Windows machines and determine whether they are undergoing a compromise. You can then feed that information into mitigating risk at runtime. Whereas Domain Join gives you a sense of control, Defender for Endpoint allows you to react to a malware attack at near real time by detecting patterns where multiple user devices are hitting untrustworthy sites, and to react by raising their device/user risk at runtime.
Take this step:
 - [Configure Conditional Access in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-conditional-access).
## Securing Identity in accordance with Executive Order 14028 on Cybersecurity & OMB Memorandum 22-09
