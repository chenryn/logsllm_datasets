titleblackhat:us-22 Google Reimagined a Phone. It was Our Job to Red Team and Secure it.
Despite the large number of phone vendors, most Android devices are based on a relatively small subset of system on a chip (SoC) vendors. Google decided to break this pattern with the Pixel 6. From a security perspective, this meant rather than using code that had been tested and used for years, there was a new stack of high value device firmware we needed to get right the first time.This talk will go over how Android secured the reimagined Pixel 6 before its launch, focusing on the perspective of the Android Red Team. The team will demonstrate how fuzz testing, black box emulators, static analysis, and manual code reviews were used to identify opportunities for privileged code execution in critical components such as the first end-to-end proof of concept on the Titan M2 chip, as well as ABL with full persistence resulting in a bypass of hardware key attestation. Finally, the Android Red Team will demonstrate multiple security-critical demos. This work showcased the value of red teaming, ensuring a more secure and safe Pixel 6 before its release.
