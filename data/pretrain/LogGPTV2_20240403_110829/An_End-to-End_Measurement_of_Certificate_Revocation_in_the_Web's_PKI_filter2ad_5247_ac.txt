### Impact on Security and OCSP Stapling

If clients are diligent in downloading revocation information, there should be no adverse impact on security. However, a lack of vigilance could make impersonation attacks possible. Our findings also indicate that website administrators rarely enable OCSP Stapling, the most efficient and client-friendly protocol for distributing revocations.

### 5. CA Behavior

#### 5.1 Availability of Revocation Information

Upon receiving a request to revoke a certificate, CAs are responsible for maintaining a highly available service for disseminating revocation information. In this section, we examine the characteristics of the distribution mechanisms provided by CAs.

We briefly explore the evolution of revocation information inclusion in certificates in Figure 4, which shows the fraction of new certificates containing potentially reachable CRL distribution points or OCSP responders each month. We observe that CRLs have been included in almost all certificates issued over the past four years, while OCSP adoption was slower (unsurprisingly, as it was standardized much later than CRLs). A notable spike in the prevalence of OCSP information occurred in July 2012, corresponding to the adoption of OCSP by RapidSSL, a low-cost CA owned by GeoTrust.

These results are encouraging, as both forms of revocation are now included in nearly all certificates. However, both schemes have their drawbacks: CRLs impose bandwidth burdens, and querying an OCSP responder can slow down page load times for browsers. Consequently, there has been pushback from both the CA and browser communities. As demonstrated in the previous section, OCSP Stapling is still only deployed on a small fraction of web servers.

#### 5.2 Size of Revocation Information

One common criticism of CRLs is the network traffic required to download them. We now examine the sizes of CRLs and how they have evolved over time.

CRLs contain one entry for each revoked certificate, so the size of the CRL (in bytes) is expected to correlate with the number of entries. This correlation is plotted in Figure 5, showing a strong linear relationship, except for CRLs with just a few entries, which have some fixed overhead. On average, each entry is 38 bytes.

Figure 5 suggests that most CRLs are small. We further explore this trend in Figure 6, which presents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of CRL sizes. Half of all CRLs are under 900 B. However, this statistic can be misleading: if you select a certificate at random, it is unlikely to point to a tiny CRL, as these cover very few certificates. To address this, we plot the CRL size per certificate as the Weighted distribution in Figure 6. The Weighted distribution tells a different story: the CRL size for the median certificate is 51 KB, and we observe CRLs ranging up to 76 MB. Although one can argue that weighing CRLs is unfair (as clients can cache them), 95% of CRLs expire in less than 24 hours, reducing a client’s ability to save bandwidth through caching.

One mechanism CAs can use to reduce the size of CRLs is to maintain multiple CRLs, assigning only a subset of all issued certificates to each CRL. Table 1 explores the extent to which different CAs use this technique. Generally, CAs use only a small number of CRLs. GoDaddy, which uses this technique to the largest extent with 322 unique CRLs, still has an average CRL size of over 1MB due to the large number of revocations. The trend is not entirely consistent, as various CA policies affect the resulting CRL size.

Our findings confirm that fetching CRLs can be an expensive operation for clients, especially those on bandwidth-constrained networks (e.g., mobile devices). Properly verifying a certificate requires the client to download the CRL before fully establishing the SSL connection, leading to a latency penalty for interactive applications like web browsers. The large size of CRLs is particularly problematic when compared to the size of an OCSP query and response, which is typically less than 1 KB and often comes with a latency penalty under 250 ms.

#### 5.3 Summary

Overall, our results show that, while there are potentially high costs involved in disseminating revocation information, many CAs have not widely adopted smaller CRLs. Combined with the lack of widespread OCSP Stapling adoption, there are multiple opportunities to significantly lower the costs incurred by CAs and browsers when obtaining certificate revocation information.

### 6. Client Behavior

The burden of certificate validation is placed entirely on the client, which must check the validity of the presented certificate chain and obtain revocation information from CAs to ensure none of the certificates have been revoked. We now explore the extent to which the most popular SSL clients—web browsers—perform these checks. Web browser developers face a strong tension between minimizing latency and ensuring security, as checking certificate revocation information can take significant effort.

#### 6.1 Methodology

Our goal is to build a test harness that determines whether a web browser chooses to check certificate revocation information for a variety of different kinds of certificates and chains. Ideally, we would use real certificates, but this would require access to a real intermediate certificate (an unlikely prospect). Instead, we generate our own root certificate and install it so that the web browser trusts it. This allows us to generate and sign intermediate and leaf certificates as needed.

We build a test suite covering many combinations of chain length, protocols, etc. For each test, we generate a unique set of certificates (i.e., intermediates and leaf certificates are not reused across tests to eliminate caching effects). Each intermediate contains a unique subject name, and each leaf contains a unique common name. Each test is served by a dedicated Nginx web server. When generating test cases, we consider four different dimensions:

- **CA**: GoDaddy, RapidSSL, Comodo, PositiveSSL, GeoTrust, Verisign, Thawte, GlobalSign, StartCom
- **Unique CRLs**: 322, 5, 30, 3, 27, 37, 32, 26, 17
- **Total Revoked Certificates**: 277,500, 2,153, 7,169, 8,177, 3,081, 15,438, 4,446, 24,242, 1,752
- **Average CRL Size (KB)**: 1,184.0, 34.5, 517.6, 441.3, 12.9, 205.2, 25.4, 2,050.0, 240.5

Table 1 summarizes the number of CRLs, total and revoked certificates, and the average CRL size per certificate for the largest CAs.
