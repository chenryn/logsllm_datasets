User: What is port mapping? How to do port forwarding on router?
Assistant: Port mapping is the process of mapping public IP addresses and ports to private IP addresses and ports. It allows access from the public network to devices or services in the private network. To perform port mapping on the router, the following steps are required: 1. Open the management page of the router, enter the administrator user name and password; 2. Find the "Port Mapping" or "Port Forwarding" option, and click to enter; 3. In the "Add Mapping" Or on the "Add Forwarding" page, enter the private network IP address and port number; 4. Enter the public network port number, which is usually the default port number of the service to be accessed; 5. Save and enable the mapping or forwarding. In this way, when a public network user accesses the public network IP address and public network port number of the router, the router will forward the request to the private network IP address and port, realizing the function of the public network accessing the device or service in the private network.
