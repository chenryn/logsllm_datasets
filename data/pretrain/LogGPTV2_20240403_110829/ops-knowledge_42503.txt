To address the issue of identifying where user credentials are mentioned in a Windows Server, especially after a password change that is causing authentication failures and account lockouts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Access Event Viewer:**
   - Open the Event Viewer by pressing `Win + R`, typing `eventvwr.msc`, and pressing Enter. Alternatively, you can navigate to it through `Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Event Viewer`.

2. **Locate Relevant Logs:**
   - In the Event Viewer, focus on the following logs:
     - **Security Log:** This log contains events related to security, including login attempts, account management, and policy changes.
     - **System Log:** This log records system-level events, which may include service start/stop and other relevant activities.

3. **Filter Events for Specific User:**
   - To filter events for the specific user, right-click on the Security or System log and select "Filter Current Log."
   - In the Filter Current Log dialog, enter the username in the "Event sources" or "User" field to narrow down the events to those involving the specific user.

4. **Analyze Authentication Attempts:**
   - Look for events with ID 4625 (Failed Login) and ID 4624 (Successful Login). These events will help you identify where the old password is being used.
   - Additionally, check for events related to service starts and stops, as services might be using the old credentials.

5. **Check Configuration Files and Services:**
   - Review the configuration files and settings for any services that might be using the old credentials. Common places to check include:
     - **Service Control Manager (SCM):** Use `services.msc` to review the services and their logon properties.
     - **Scheduled Tasks:** Check the Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`) for tasks that might be running under the old credentials.
     - **IIS Configuration:** If your server runs IIS, check the application pool identities and other IIS configurations.
     - **Registry Settings:** Some applications store credentials in the registry. Use `regedit` to search for the old credentials.

6. **Update Credentials:**
   - Once you have identified all the locations where the old credentials are used, update them to the new password.
   - Ensure that all services, scheduled tasks, and other configurations are updated to use the new credentials.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issues caused by the old credentials, preventing further account lockouts and ensuring smooth operation of the server.
