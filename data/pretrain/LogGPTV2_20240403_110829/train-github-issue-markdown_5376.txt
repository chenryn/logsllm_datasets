I'd like to see support for the TestNG framework in the Spring Mocks area. To
that end, I've gone ahead and done an initial conversion using the existing
AbstractSpringContextTest and it's subclasses. As I worked on it, I felt that
there was a ton of logic that would have to be duplicated in both trees and
can probably be abstracted in some way. In addition there's backwards
compatibility using XBean for TestNG if you want to support pre 1.5 (non-
annotation) use of TestNG.
As far as the changes go, I simply removed the TestCase extension point and
used annotations to get the setUp() method to run at the beginning of each
test class. In addition, I removed the tearDown() and the onSetUp() and
onTearDown() methods. TestNG guarentees that multiple 'beforeTestClass' and
'beforeTestMethod' are executed descending through the inheritence tree. In
addition, this should give users more power as they can now set dependencies
of methods to guarentee order. In addition in the Transaction classes, the
creation and rollback of the transactions area listed as
'before/afterTestMethod'.
I realize that this is simply a first cut and there will still need to be work
done. I'd like to see this as part of 2.0 final, but understand if it can't
make it. If you want me to redo the work with design input from you all,
that'd be OK as well.
