I would like to propose adding support for the TestNG framework in the Spring Mocks area. To this end, I have completed an initial conversion using the existing `AbstractSpringContextTest` and its subclasses. During the process, I noticed a significant amount of logic that would need to be duplicated across both the JUnit and TestNG implementations. This duplication can likely be abstracted to improve maintainability.

Additionally, there is a backward compatibility consideration for TestNG if you wish to support pre-1.5 (non-annotation) usage. 

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed the `TestCase` Extension Point**: I replaced the `TestCase` extension with annotations to ensure the `setUp()` method runs at the beginning of each test class.
2. **Eliminated `tearDown()`, `onSetUp()`, and `onTearDown()` Methods**: TestNG guarantees that multiple `@BeforeClass` and `@BeforeMethod` annotations are executed in the correct order as they descend through the inheritance tree. This change should provide users with more flexibility, as they can now set method dependencies to guarantee execution order.
3. **Transaction Management**: In the transaction-related classes, the creation and rollback of transactions are now handled by `@BeforeMethod` and `@AfterMethod` annotations.

### Considerations:
- **Backward Compatibility**: If supporting pre-1.5 TestNG (non-annotation) is a requirement, we will need to integrate XBean.
- **Future Work**: This is just an initial implementation, and further refinement will be necessary. I aim to include this feature in the 2.0 final release, but I understand if it cannot be included. If you would like me to rework the implementation based on your design input, I am open to that as well.
