## Abstract
With the rapid advancement of computing and communication technologies, vast amounts of data are being collected, stored, utilized, and shared. This has led to new security and privacy challenges. Existing platforms often lack flexible and practical access control mechanisms for big data analytics. In this paper, we introduce GuardSpark++, a fine-grained purpose-aware access control (PAAC) mechanism for secure data sharing and analysis in Apache Spark. We propose a PAAC model that introduces the concept of data processing and operation purposes into conventional purpose-based access control (PBAC). An automatic purpose analysis algorithm is developed to identify purposes from data analytics operations and queries, enabling effective access control enforcement. Additionally, we integrate an access control mechanism into Spark Catalyst, providing unified PAAC enforcement for heterogeneous data sources and upper-layer applications. Our evaluation with five data sources and four structured data analytics engines in Spark demonstrates that GuardSpark++ provides robust access control with minimal performance overhead (average 3.97%).

## 1 Introduction
In the era of big data, an enormous amount of data is being collected, stored, and utilized across various platforms and applications. Big data processing platforms have been developed to harness this data, facilitate data analytics, and extract intrinsic value. These platforms are designed to access diverse data sources, support hybrid data analytics engines (e.g., advanced SQL, machine learning, and graph), and efficiently process large volumes of data. However, data security and privacy were not adequately considered during their design, resulting in limited data protection functions. For example, users often gain full access to sensitive raw data when they should only execute aggregate or statistical queries. Moreover, data becomes more vulnerable in large-scale cross-organizational data sharing, where curious users may correlate data from multiple sources to extract sensitive information.

To address these challenges, we propose GuardSpark++, a fine-grained access control mechanism for big data sharing and analysis. We first design a purpose-aware access control (PAAC) model, which introduces data processing and operation purposes to conventional PBAC. With PAAC, GuardSpark++ can automatically recognize data processing purposes from data processing logic and make access decisions accordingly. We enforce the PAAC model in the Catalyst optimizer of Spark, adding an access control enforcement stage between the analysis and optimization stages. This stage generates secure logical query plans based on specified PAAC policies, ensuring that sensitive data objects are used only in operations consistent with authorized purposes. We evaluate GuardSpark++ with five data sources (network streaming, LFS, HDFS, MySQL, and Kafka) and four structured data analytics engines (SQL, ML Pipeline, GraphFrame, and Structured Streaming). Our experiments using the TPC-DS benchmark show that GuardSpark++ introduces an average overhead of only 3.97%.

To our knowledge, GuardSpark++ is the first practical purpose-aware access control solution for big data security in Spark. Our main contributions are:
- Designing a fine-grained purpose-aware access control (PAAC) model with newly defined data processing and operation purposes for big data analytics. We develop an analysis algorithm to support automatic purpose recognition, which is essential for enforcing PAAC.
- Developing a PAAC enforcement mechanism that provides unified access control support for heterogeneous data sources and higher-layer data analytics engines in Spark.
- Evaluating GuardSpark++'s effectiveness and efficiency with five data sources and four data analytics engines. Experimental results show that GuardSpark++ provides expected security guarantees with minimal computation overhead.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces Apache Spark and our motivation. Section 3 presents the threat model and an overview of GuardSpark++. Sections 4 and 5 detail the PAAC model, purpose analysis algorithm, and the PAAC enforcement mechanism. Sections 6 and 7 present experimental results and security analysis. Finally, Section 8 surveys related literature, and Section 9 concludes the paper.

## 2 Background and Motivation

### 2.1 Introduction to Apache Spark
Apache Spark is a unified computing engine in the big data ecosystem, consisting of three layers: application layer, optimization layer, and execution layer. At the application layer, Spark supports structured data analytics engines/APIs based on DataFrame and Dataset types.
