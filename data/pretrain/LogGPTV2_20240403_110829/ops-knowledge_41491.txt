User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is this Polish IP doing on my internal WiFi? Lately I've seen many strange events in the logs of my wifi router / cable modem. Many are linked to the IP address 83.0.68.240 from the ISP, Orange Polanska. Events like "DoS attack: Ping Of Death", "DoS attack: Teardrop or derivative" etc.

However today the situation rose to a new level: The IP address was no longer limited to appearing in the logs of outside attackers. It now appeared to be one of the devices on the Wi-Fi network. See linked photo: http://imgur.com/YFgLBCJ

The Mac address of the device suggests it is an Apple device. At one point the name of the device was the same as the name of a roommate's iPhone.  I asked the roommate if he was using a VPN on his phone, and he said no.

Is it possible that person from Poland has in fact enter the network?

If the iPhone was hacked, why would it appear on the Wi-Fi network as a Polish IP address?

FYI, I asked Orange Polanska twice to shut this attacker down and they have not done it.

Assistant: The reason a computer would be listed in that section with an external IP is that the malicious device wants its traffic to look like it came from that other address.  This is commonly done as part of a DDOS of other places, because the false source IP causes all of the returned traffic to head to that other address (in cases like amplification attacks this can be very powerful).  Are you noticing anything like poor performance of the network overall?  Or a lot of registered traffic even though you are only browsing StackExchange?

There is possibly a compromised device on your network.  It may also be that the constant stream of malicious packets finally caused the router to mix up traffic to the point where it looked like some packet outbound had that source IP (no telling how well written that Netgear code is).  As a mitigation, (and if possible from that device) you could try blocking all traffic to/from that IP (if its the only one that has been noted to have malicious activity) and see if the strange behavior stops.
