User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Issue with COM+DLL in IIS 6.0 We have a COM+DLL in IIS 6 supporting an ASP classic Application. We have successfully debugged to the point that we know that the DLL is causing hangs in the worker process (a call to the object is never returned).  What configuration options are there for fixing this issue?

Assistant: The solution we found was to limit the amount of time COM+ will let a call run, and then  terminate it.

We found this event in the event log that gave it away:


  The average call duration has exceeded 10 minutes. If this is not the expected behavior, please see article 910904 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base at http://support.microsoft.com for details on how to use the COM+ AutoDump feature to automatically generate dump files and/or terminate the process if the problem occurs again.
  Server Application ID: {20D49551-DF30-4A60-B553-CAD7B97F2153}
  Server Application Instance ID:
  {45DB1F97-8995-481C-94EE-CA891E446202}
  Server Application Name: &lt;-REDACTED->


Which lead us to this kb.

We then modified the settings at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\COM3\AutoDump 
according to the kb.  The issue still occurs, but now it doesn't hang up the whole server, only one user gets hung.
