ABSTRACT
As our economy and critical infrastructure increasingly relies on
the Internet, the insecurity of the underlying border gateway rout-
ing protocol (BGP) stands out as the Achilles heel. Recent miscon-
ﬁgurations and attacks have demonstrated the brittleness of BGP.
Securing BGP has become a priority.
In this paper, we focus on a viable deployment path to secure
BGP. We analyze security requirements, and consider tradeoffs of
mechanisms that achieve the requirements. In particular, we study
how to secure BGP update messages against attacks. We design
an efﬁcient cryptographic mechanism that relies only on symmet-
ric cryptographic primitives to guard an ASPATH from alteration,
and propose the Secure Path Vector (SPV) protocol. In contrast to
the previously proposed S-BGP protocol, SPV is around 22 times
faster. With the current effort to secure BGP, we anticipate that
SPV will contribute several alternative mechanisms to secure BGP,
especially for the case of incremental deployments.

an attacker [46]. Recent studies and examples show that even rou-
tine misconﬁgurations severely disrupt Internet routing [34, 41].
The need to secure BGP has become increasingly pressing, so Kent
et al. proposed the Secure BGP routing protocol (S-BGP) [27], and
the IETF has established the rpsec working group [51] to detail re-
quirements for a secure routing protocol.
There are several impediments to the deployment of BGP se-
curity, many of which are inherent to any Internet deployment that
needs wide-spread adoption. A viable scheme must provide incre-
mental beneﬁts even when not all routers participate. Changes to
existing router code should be minimized, and unchanged (legacy)
routers must not break when enhanced messages are received from
participating routers. Secured updates must ﬁt within the length
limit of BGP Update messages. Some form of certiﬁcate hierar-
chy is necessary for authenticating public keys of participants, but
the use and management of private keys should be minimized for
operational simplicity.
Computational efﬁciency in authenticating Update messages is
important because core Internet routers receive a high volume of
such messages, and they may arrive in bursts. Efﬁcient veriﬁca-
tion during these bursts is of utmost importance, since such bursts
generally occur when the routing topology has changed, and data
packets will be dropped or misrouted until routing reconverges.
Moreover, providing security against routing update replay attacks
may require periodic Update messages rather than only event driven
messages, making efﬁcient authentication even more desirable.
In this paper, we make several contributions to securing BGP.
We propose a new protocol, SPV, which replaces much of the com-
putationally expensive asymmetric cryptography, as used in S-BGP,
with a far less costly signature scheme based on symmetric cryp-
tography. Moreover, the proposed cryptographic mechanisms can
be cheaply implemented and easily parallelized in special purpose
hardware, thus providing additional speedup. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst proposal to use efﬁcient symmetric key
cryptography to prevent an attacker from modifying and truncating
the ASPATH. While still requiring some use of asymmetric cryp-
tography and certiﬁcate hierarchies, the proposed scheme removes
the need for keeping private keys on routers, which simpliﬁes over-
all key management (we only store short-lived one-time private
keys on routers). Using BGP traces, we demonstrate that SPV is
much more efﬁcient than previous approaches.
SPV also includes improved mechanisms for securing against
ASPATH tampering as compared to S-BGP as currently proposed;
we show how these same improvements could also be incorporated
into S-BGP. The focus of SPV is on protecting BGP Update mes-
sages; we do not focus on the integrity of BGP policy deﬁnitions.
However, SPV will protect against certain types of misconﬁgura-
tion, such as a BGP speaker conﬁgured with the wrong ASN.
Finally, we show how SPV provides improved security against
malicious ASPATH modiﬁcations, relative to S-BGP, when only
some routers implement a secure BGP protocol; in fact our mecha-
179nisms provide attack and misconﬁguration protections even if only
two ISPs deploy them. SPV provides an increased level of security,
which should make it easier to convince system administrators of
the value of deployment. Such tangible properties may help moti-
vate ISPs to deploy these mechanisms, since an administrator can
determine which recent routing problems the secure protocol could
have prevented.
Outline Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces
our assumptions and attacker model, and Section 3 discusses prior
research that is closely related. We describe SPV in Section 4 and
evaluate it in Section 5. Finally, we discuss other related work in
Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.
2 BGP SECURITY THREATS
Several researchers have studied BGP vulnerabilities [2, 11, 28,
51]. Based on this prior research, we establish classes of BGP vul-
nerabilities, and we discuss the security properties that SPV pro-
vides in Section 5.1.
We consider active attackers that actively inject malicious traf-
ﬁc into the network. We consider a strong attacker model, where
the attacker compromises routers in the network to perform denial-
of-service (DoS) or falsiﬁcation attacks. This is equivalent to a
malicious insider who can control the routers and will thus know
all cryptographic keys of the infrastructure. Even in this case, we
want to prevent the attacker from falsifying external information,
so that it can only affect internal preﬁxes.
We distinguish two main attack classes: falsiﬁcation and denial-
of-service (DoS). Our categorization is based on the routing proto-
col’s reaction to the attack; in particular, because routing underlies
almost all services, falsiﬁcation attacks can result in denial of a
speciﬁc service, but will in most cases not result in denial of the
routing service itself.
2.1 Falsiﬁcation Attacks
We loosely deﬁne a falsiﬁcation attack as a bogus BGP proto-
col message that differs from a message that a correctly conﬁgured
router would send.1 The term “falsiﬁcation” is also used by Barbir,
Murphy, and Yang [2]. Due to space limitations, we do not dis-
cuss falsiﬁcations of components of an OPEN, NOTIFICATION, or
KEEPALIVE message; these messages could be secured by using
IPsec [26, 25] and appropriate certiﬁcates. In the subsequent dis-
cussion, we focus on the falsiﬁcation of the UPDATE message.
We now consider the components of a BGP UPDATE message
(withdrawn routes, path attributes, and network layer reachability
information (NLRI)), and discuss the impact of a falsiﬁcation of
the contained information.
An attacker can falsify information in the list of withdrawn
routes. For example, an attacker can fail to withdraw a route when
the attacker no longer has a working route, or send a withdrawal
for a working route. The latter may not be malicious, depending on
the policy of that AS; for example, if two peers may change their
transit agreement, then each of their neighbors may see withdrawals
for working routes.
An attacker can falsify the NLRI, i.e., the IP preﬁxes that the
UPDATE message and path attributes pertain to. Within the NLRI,
an attacker can originate a route to a preﬁx with which it is not
afﬁliated, and can try to force other routers to prefer that route by
advertising a longer preﬁx for that route. Since longer (more spe-
ciﬁc) preﬁxes are preferred, the attacker would thus be creating a
blackhole.
1Different BGP implementations may produce different messages; we consider a mes-
sage to be correct if it adheres to the BGP protocol speciﬁcation and is produced by a
router with a “correct” conﬁguration.
The blackhole attack is a general attack that relies on falsiﬁca-
tion. In a blackhole attack, a malicious AS injects malicious routing
information to attract trafﬁc that would otherwise not ﬂow through
it, thus gaining control of a path. The blackhole attack is very pow-
erful, since an attacker in this position can deny routing to certain
addresses, eavesdrop on all trafﬁc to a particular destination, or use
its routing position to perform man-in-the-middle attacks. An ex-
ample of a blackhole is the AS 7007 incident, where, due to a mis-
conﬁguration, an AS announced short routes to many destinations,
causing global connectivity problems for two hours [41]. We distin-
guish blackhole and grayhole attacks. In a grayhole, the attacker se-
lectively drops trafﬁc ﬂowing through it, without injecting any ma-
licious routing information into the network. Grayhole attacks can-
not easily be prevented by a secure routing protocol (since no fal-
siﬁed routing information was injected), whereas blackhole attacks
can be prevented.
We now discuss falsiﬁcation of the path attributes. As a sim-
ple defense against falsiﬁcation, the origin and local pref attributes
received from an eBGP session can be set to a default value, and the
MED and next hop attributes are ignored unless otherwise agreed
upon by both peers. Due to lack of space, we also do not fur-
ther discuss the atomic aggregate and aggregator attributes, though
these are automatically secured by SPV, as described in Section 4.5.
A severe attack is AS path or AS set falsiﬁcation, since falsi-
fying the AS path has serious consequences. For example, many
policy decisions are made based on the AS path, and the length of
the AS path is (after the local pref value) the second consideration
in selecting a path towards a destination. As a result, changing the
AS path can cause the attacker’s route to be preferred.
An attacker can create a more preferable route by shortening
the AS path. In this paper, we refer to this attack as the truncation
attack, and it can be used to form a blackhole. An attacker can also
modify the AS path by altering ASNs. In this paper, we refer to
this attack as the modiﬁcation attack. This may cause the next AS
to prefer a route through the attacker, and the attacker may be able
to create a blackhole.
An attacker with control of the preferred route can select be-
tween the grayhole attack (i.e., selective dropping) and a number
of similar attacks. For example, an attacker can make a neighbor-
ing AS discard a preﬁx by falsely prepending the neighboring ASN
to that preﬁx in the UPDATE to trigger loop detection when that
preﬁx reaches the AS [17]. (However, to recover from partitions
of an AS, some ASes do not drop UPDATEs that would result in a
loop [54].) A somewhat weaker attack is to prepend random ASNs
to the AS path for the purpose of making the path longer. In gen-
eral, this should discourage trafﬁc from using this route; in fact,
this preference for shorter AS paths is useful for trafﬁc engineering
(through the use of AS path prepending). An attacker can also at-
tempt to use BGP’s ﬂap damping to delay a router from picking an
alternate route to some destination. This achieves the same result
as the grayhole attack (packets are dropped in the network), though
it is somewhat stealthier. All these attacks, however, require that
the attacker control the preferred path. As a result, we consider the
grayhole attack to be more powerful, and ignore these attacks in the
rest of the paper.
A wormhole or tunnel attack is a speciﬁc mechanism that can
be used to perform blackhole attack, where multiple colluding BGP
routers exchange BGP UPDATE trafﬁc over a tunneled connection,
such as PPP over TCP [24]. These tunneled BGP UPDATEs allow a
router to claim better paths to a destination than actually physically
exist. The tunneling attack is devastating even against secure BGP
routing protocols; for example, in S-BGP, two colluding malicious
routers can forward UPDATE trafﬁc to each other, signing route
attestations for each other. SPV is also unable to prevent these
attacks.
Unauthorized propagation or AS path announcements. An
attacker can propagate a route that it should not. For example, ser-
vice providers generally do not want their routes to be readver-
tised by their customers; otherwise, a multihomed customer may
begin advertising transit capability between two large providers.
However, that customer is unlikely to have sufﬁcient resources to
provide such a service, which would result in either severely de-
graded performance or a blackhole.
In addition, a router should
only announce preﬁxes and AS paths that it actively uses to route
towards that preﬁx. A malicious router may announce preﬁxes and
AS paths it is not actively using, and greatly increasing the rate of
BGP UPDATEs.
2.2 Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
If we consider routing as a service, falsiﬁcation attacks can also
result in DoS. However, here we discuss DoS attacks on the BGP
speaker, and on the TCP connection of the BGP session.
The classic DoS attack is a resource exhaustion attack. An
attacker may be able to paralyze a router by exhausting its compu-
tation resources. Several approaches may be used to perform this
attack. An attacker may be able to trick a router into performing
resource-intensive operations, such as public-key certiﬁcate veri-
ﬁcations or signature generations, which require on the order of
milliseconds each. Recently, researchers discovered algorithmic
complexity attacks, where an attacker fabricates inputs to evoke the
worst-case running time of an algorithm, slowing the device down
to a crawl [12]. As a result, a router may not be able to recompute
its routing table, process BGP UPDATE messages, or even keep the
BGP session alive. If a BGP session is torn down, each BGP peer
will withdraw any routing table entries learned from the other BGP
peer.
Another attack is to exhaust the bandwidth of a network link
to starve off the TCP connection used for the BGP session. If the
BGP peers are directly connected, they may allocate bandwidth re-
sources for the BGP session; however, some BGP peers are not di-
rectly connected (such as peers connecting over an exchange point);
in such cases, an attacker can ﬂood intermediate links. A ﬂooding
prevention mechanism such as SIFF could be used in this case [58].
Finally, an attacker can use low-layer protocol attacks to di-
rectly attack the BGP session. The attacker may mount a PHY
layer attack to disable communication links. Since BGP relies on
the TCP protocol, it inherits all TCP vulnerabilities [4].2 For exam-
ple, due to a lack of origin authentication in the TCP protocol, an
attacker can inject malicious TCP packets, spooﬁng the IP source
address of the other TCP end point, an attack which we call TCP
poisoning. In this attack, the attacker guesses the TCP sequence
numbers and injects bogus TCP reset (RST) packets to cause the
victim to close its TCP connection. Using IPsec will prevent this
attack.
3 CLOSELY RELATED WORK
In this section, we discuss prior work that is closely related to SPV.
We discuss the remaining related work in Section 6.
3.1 Hop-by-Hop Authentication
In hop-by-hop authentication, ISPs use authentication to prevent
attacks against the eBGP TCP session (e.g., malicious message
injection by an outsider). However, falsiﬁcation of the AS path
cannot be addressed by hop-by-hop authentication. However, hop-
by-hop authentication is an important start, and several approaches
based entirely on hop-by-hop authentication have been proposed

in the low-layer attack section, as BGP relies on TCP.

ments and propose hop-by-hop encryption and authentication to
secure routing UPDATEs [31]. Smith and Garcia-Luna-Aceves [52]
discuss weaknesses of the BGP protocol and propose some basic
countermeasures, which use digital signatures to provide hop-by-
