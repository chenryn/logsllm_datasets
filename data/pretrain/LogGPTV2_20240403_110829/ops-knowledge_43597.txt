User: How to achieve high availability and disaster recovery backup of the database? Please explain with specific cases.
Assistant: High availability and disaster recovery backup are must-have features of database systems to ensure the continuity and stability of data processing in order to cope with various unexpected situations, such as hardware failures, network failures, natural disasters, etc. The following are some common methods and specific cases to achieve database high availability and disaster recovery backup: 1. High availability cluster A high availability cluster is a cluster composed of multiple servers, including a primary server and multiple standby servers, and the primary server processes requests , the standby server is in backup state. When the main server fails, the standby server can take over the work of the main server to achieve fast failover. Case: Oracle RAC (Real Application Cluster) cluster uses shared storage technology to achieve data sharing and high availability among multiple nodes. 2. Database mirroring Database mirroring is the complete and real-time replication of data to another server to achieve disaster recovery backup and high availability of data. Data synchronization is maintained between the primary server and the standby server. When the primary server fails, the standby server immediately takes over the data processing. Case: SQL Server mirroring, supports asynchronous and synchronous mirroring, and realizes real-time data synchronization and failover. 3. Database replication Database replication is to copy data from one server to another server in real time, so as to realize disaster recovery and high availability of data. There is no need to maintain data synchronization between the primary server and the standby server. When the primary server fails, the standby server needs to manually take over the data processing. Case: MySQL replication, supports master-slave replication and multi-slave replication, and realizes real-time data synchronization and failover. 4. Database backup Database backup is to back up the data and metadata of the database to the backup server or storage device, so that when the database fails or is lost, the data can be quickly restored. Backup methods include full backup, incremental backup, and differential backup. Case: Oracle backup, supports data pump backup and RMAN backup, can back up the entire database, table space, data files and control files, etc., to achieve data backup and recovery. In short, it is very important to achieve high availability and disaster recovery backup of the database. Enterprises need to choose appropriate methods and tools according to their business needs and actual conditions.
