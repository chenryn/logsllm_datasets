Revised (NEOPI-R, 240 items) for instance, in which the participants’ per-
sonality types are revealed after they answer several questions [11,55]. Except
explicit ways of identifying users’ personality types, user’s personality types can
be extracted by analyzing posts and activities like written review texts from
online social media [44]. For instance, in the work presented by the Kosinski
et al. [29], users’ facebook activities are recorded and then logistic regression is
applied to predict the people’s personality type. Although personality detection
with questionnaires might reveal a better understanding of a user’s personal-
ity, it is a tedious and time-consuming task and thus users may be unwilling to
attend to it. In contrast, in implicit personality detection models, user’s digi-
tal footprints, and their behaviors and actions could be analyzed with no extra
burden on users [4].
2.3 Personality-Aware RS
In contrast to traditional CF approaches, users’ personality types, which can
explain the wide variety of human behavior, have inspired some recommender
systems [5,52,54]. For instance, Hu and Pu [25] detect user personality types
by providing a questionnaire for users and ask them to answer the questions.
Then, the results show a better performance compared to the purely collabora-
tive filtering methods. TWIN is another example of integrating personality in
recommender system which calculates the user personality types based on the
NEO-PersonalityInventory-Revisedclassificationscheme(alsoknownastheBig
Five model) [43]. Adopting users’ personality types not only can provide users

tage of taking users’ personality is to better deal with the data sparsity and
cold-start problems [8,52]. Except all mentioned above benefits of incorporating

2.4 What is Trust?
In early human societies people tend to interact with each other to fulfil their
needs. Soon after, they realized that not all surrounded people that they have
interacted are trustworthy and they need to filter those who they can trust.
Trust can be defined as the ‘willingness of a party to be vulnerable to actions of
298 S. Yakhchi et al.
another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular
action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control
that other party’ [35]. ‘Trust is necessary in order to face the unknown, whether
that unknown is another human being, or simply the future and its contingent
events’7. Sociologically speaking, ‘a complete absence of trust would prevent
[one] even getting up in the morning’ [31].
Trust may be considered as a key property in users’ behaviors in Online
Social Networks (OSNs). In computer science, a definition of trust is defined by
Tangetal.[45]as‘Trustprovidesinformationaboutwithwhomweshouldshare
information, from whom we should accept information and what considerations
togivetoinformationfrompeoplewhenaggregatingorfilteringdata’.Trustcan
be used in too many applications, including fake news detection [14], retweet
behaviour detection [1,7] and recommender systems [32,57]. The main step in
all of these applications is trust prediction between users, and of course there
are many different views of how to measure and use trust.
2.5 Trust Acquisition
Trust is a context-dependent concept, a trust relationship is a connection
between a source user (trustor) and a target user (trustee) that indicates that
thetrustortruststhetrustee.Withthehelpoftrust,thetrustormayseekinfor-
mationfromthetrustee,toavoidbeingconfusedbythehugeamountofavailable
data (i.e., mitigated information overload) and to be confident about the cred-
ibility of the received information (i.e., increased information credibility) [46].
Trust can be acquired explicitly or implicitly [15]. The explicit trust prediction
model try to use the pre-established relationships which is manly based on the
analyzing the web of trust for a particular user (i.e., if userA trusts user B, and
userB trustsuserC,thenitismorelikelythatuserAtrustsuserC)[17,18,21].
While implicit based trust prediction model try to use the basis of the item rat-
ings for inferring trust among users [22], in which how users rate the items is a
main basis for building a trust network.

Due to the strength property of trust in discovering a set of trustworthy neigh-

an increasing amount of attention in a number of research communities [13]. It
has been shown by the existing studies that incorporating trust information
in the recommender systems leads to increase the quality of the recommenda-
tions [16,20,30,34]. FilmTrust [19] is an example of trust-based RS which first

for each trustor and trustee from the locally-generated trust relationships’. The
authors also have adopted prior knowledge (e.g., trust bias and trust propaga-
tion) in order to improve the accuracy of their approach. In the work presented
by Zhang et al. [58], it is discussed that in a trust relationship the source user

3 Overview and Framework
Figure1 depicts our novel framework called TAP. For the first phase of this
framework, we analyze the contents and contexts of users’ generated informa-
tionandcontextualizetheserawdatatodiscoverusers’maincharacteristics,like
their personality types. For the next phase, we monitor a user’s activities and
those of her neighbors’ activities in a particular domain to figure out how other
users are influenced by her opinions/comments to ascertain her level of knowl-
edge. In the following sections, we give more details about each main phase of
TAP.Notethat,ourframeworkaimstocaptureusers’interestsinordertomake

ness profits. To do that, we first construct a user-item interactions matrix with
the real values of ratings in order to preserve the degree of users’ interests and

3.2 Detecting Users’ Personality Types
Unlike most of the current methods which detect users’ personality types by
asking them to fill a questionnaire, in our work, the users’ personality types are

to measure a user’s personality traits as follows:
E =w 1X 1+w 2X 2+w 3X 3+···+w iX i (2)
where X i and w i denote a category of LIWC and its corresponding weight,
respectively, i ∈ {1,2,...,n} and n = 88, which is the total number of LIWC

weights which can be extracted by Mairesse et al. [33]. In addition to the users’
personality types, the level of an individual’s knowledge can be one of the main
factors to determine the acceptance rate of her/his recommendations, which we

level of knowledge about various domains, but they may be an expert in one or
some of them. We mark the level of knowledge of u i in domain d, as kl id, and
can be computed as follows:
nd

kld hi,d
= (3)
i nd p
i p=1
where nd i is the total number of reviews left by user u i in that domain, and
hi,d represents the ratings that are given to each review p by other users in this
p
domain.
3.3 Trust Acquisition
As we discussed in Sect.2, there are a wide range of trust prediction models
in the literature. However, in the context of recommender system we have a
limited source of available information for measuring the trust among users.
Therefore, to calculate the trust, we leverage our previous work [14], which con-
siderssocialcontextfactorsintrustpredictiontask.Ourproposedmodelisbased
on the consideration of the level of expertise, interest, number of followers, fre-
quencyandqualityofpreviousinteractions,andself-disclosureforcapturingthe
trust relations. We take the level of expertise because a recommendation from
an expert person in a certain domain is more acceptable compared to the less
knowledgeable person. Next, the reason behind incorporating interest is that it
could be conceived of as an individual’s attitude towards a set of objects. Then,
the higher number of followers may be a good indicator of being an expert in
a particular domain. We consider the frequency and quality of previous inter-
actions between two users since it may show a high potential of establishing a
trust relation between them. Finally, according to the Social Penetration The-
ory (SPT): “as relationships develop, interpersonal communication moves from
relatively shallow, non-intimate levels to deeper, more intimate ones” [3]. Based
on this theory, self-disclosure which means revealing personal information (e.g.,
personal motives or thoughts, feelings and etc.), which can be a reason behind
constructing a relationship. In this section we avoid going into too much details
due to the space limitation, and we encourage a motivated reader to have a
look at our previous work [14]. Moreover, since this is an ongoing work, we do
not train and test our proposed model, TAP, with the extracted trust relation.
While our mathematical model presented in Sect.3.4 take both personality and
trust information into account, we only test our model when it considers per-
sonality feature to evaluate the results and leave evaluating a model with trust
information as our future work.
3.4 Our Framework
Let U = {u 1,u 2,...,u |i|} denotes the user set and V = {v 1,v 2,...,v |j|} indi-
cates the item set, where |i| and |j| are the total number of users and items,

L contains personality information, and ϕ+(d) is the set of users who have the

same personality type. Matrix T records the trust values, where T ik is the trust

Finally, the ratings score for unobserved items can be computed as follows:

η(i,i)=1, means that u i and u i are more likely to have in common interests.
Then, we have personality regularization as follows,
n m

where U, and V are the user and item latent matrices, respectively. After
some derivations for a particular u i, we have the following regularization:

η(i,i)U(i,:)−V(j,:)2= η(i,i) U(i,:)−V(j,:)

Next, we have the updating rule as follows:

U(i,j)←U(i,j) , V(i,j)←V(i,j) (8)
