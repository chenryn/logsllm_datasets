### Accessibility of Cookies in Different Browsing Modes
| Cookie Set | Cookie Accessed | Firefox | Safari | Chrome | IE |
|------------|-----------------|---------|--------|--------|----|
| Public     | Public          | No      | Yes    | No     | No |
| Public     | Private         | No      | Yes    | No     | No |
| Private    | Public          | No      | No     | No     | No |
| Private    | Same private session | Yes   | Yes    | Yes   | Yes |
| Private    | Different private session | No  | No     | No     | No |

**Table 4.** Accessibility of cookies in different browsing modes for four popular browsers: Firefox (version 3.6.11), Safari (version 5.0.2), Chrome (version 7.0.517.41), and Internet Explorer (version 8.0). The table shows whether a cookie set in one browsing mode can be accessed in another. In all cases, a cookie set in private mode can be accessed repeatedly within the same private browsing session but not across different sessions. Safari is the only browser that allows private mode to access cookies set in public mode.

### 4.3 Understanding Cookie Churn
Using the host-tracking results, we analyze cookie churn by identifying cookies associated with the same client host. In Section 3.1, we demonstrated that the host-tracking graph GUID derived from user login IDs (using HostTracker) achieved over 92% precision and recall in tracking clients, represented by hardware IDs from the Validation dataset. Thus, we use the hosts defined in GUID as ground truth for studying cookie churn. By overlapping GUID with the Search dataset, we consider cookies whose query events fall into binding windows associated with the same host as corresponding to the same user (since user activity roughly approximates host activity).

We focus on new cookie churn, which is more significant than that of old cookies (see Figure 4). We refer to the set of "one-time" cookie IDs (CIDs) that are born on the first day but do not return again in our dataset as churned new cookie IDs. In total, there are 437,914 users (or hosts) that overlap with 847,196 churned new CIDs in the Search data. The number of hosts is about half the number of churned cookie IDs. We investigate the four cases that result in new cookie churn, as illustrated in Figure 5, where the breakdown of users belonging to each category is shown in Table 5. We elaborate on each case below.

#### 4.3.1 Case 1: Non-Returning Users
If a CID overlaps with one of host h’s binding windows at time t, but no other CIDs overlap h’s bindings from time t onwards, we consider this as a user who does not return to the service (Figure 5(a)).

| Number of Users | Percentage of Users (%) | Number of Churned New CIDs | Percentage of Churned New CIDs (%) |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Case 1         | 101,427                  | 23.16                      | 101,427                             | 14.60                               |
| Case 2         | 77,120                   | 17.61                      | 77,147                              | 9.12                                |
| Case 3         | 67,310                   | 15.37                      | 544,865                             | 64.31                               |
| Case 4         | 192,057                  | 43.86                      | 123,757                             | 11.97                               |

**Table 5.** Breakdown of the churned new cookie IDs into four categories of users.

- **(a) Case 1: User left the service.**
- **(b) Case 2: User clears cookies.**
- **(c) Case 3: Private browsing mode (one UA).**
- **(d) Case 4: Multiple browsers (multiple UAs).**

**Figure 5.** Four cases of cookie churn. C1 is the churned new cookie ID. Horizontal bars denote binding windows for a "host" defined by user IDs.

This case accounts for only 11.97% of the churned new CIDs. Despite the high cookie churn rate, the majority (88.03%) of the churned new cookie IDs correspond to returning users who might still be tracked. The behaviors of the non-returning users are examined in detail in Appendix B.

#### 4.3.2 Case 2: Users that Clear Cookies
Cookie churn can also result from users intentionally removing cookies. In this case, a host h’s bindings should overlap with CIDs generated consecutively in time (Figure 5(b)). Each CID may be associated with multiple queries that typically belong to a session. Among hosts with new cookie churn, we find 77,120 (17.61%) in this category. Since we observe only cookies issued by the Bing search engine, we cannot distinguish between users who clear all cookies and those who selectively clear cookies from certain domains.

To determine if users clear cookies on exiting browsers, we examine the time intervals between consecutive queries associated with the same CID and compare them with those between consecutive queries associated with different CIDs. Figure 6 shows that the former is distinctly smaller, with 75% of them below 10 minutes, likely belonging to one session. By contrast, 90% of the query intervals between different CIDs are larger than 8 hours. This suggests that most users clear cookies per session, e.g., when they close the browser window.

We also find a small fraction (3.85%) of users whose cookies are cleared per query, i.e., each of their queries is associated with a different CID. These might be users who take extreme measures to clear cookies for each query to preserve privacy. However, such patterns can become a distinctive feature that makes tracking easier, despite the user's intention of remaining anonymous.

**Figure 6.** Distributions of query intervals.

#### 4.3.3 Case 3: Users with In-Private Browsing Mode
Another reason for cookie churn is the use of the browser’s private browsing mode. As illustrated in Figure 5(c), upon entering private mode, the old cookie (C2) set under public mode is replaced by a new cookie (C3). Upon exiting the private mode, the old cookie (C2) will continue to be used by the same user.

We focus on the hosts whose cookies appear interleaved in their binding windows, where an old cookie continues to appear after the user submits queries with a newer cookie. Since entering private browsing mode does not change the browser used by the host, we identify those associated with a single UA string as users who utilize private browsing mode, and 15.37% of users belong to this category.

Together with Case 2, there are in total around 33%—a non-trivial fraction—of users who aim to preserve privacy by either clearing cookies or entering private browsing mode. These users may still be tracked when service providers combine the host-tracking results from other identifiers (e.g., login IDs) with cookie data.

#### 4.3.4 Case 4: Users with Multiple Browsers
For the remaining users, we observe multiple cookies co-existing, though they are associated with different UA strings. Upon closer examination, we find around 67% associated with only two or three UAs. This observation suggests that these cases correspond to single hosts with multiple browsers or small home NATs. While it is more difficult to track hosts behind NATs, we note that the anonymity sets tend to be too small in such cases to protect user privacy.

A small fraction of these cases (3%) are associated with a large number of UA strings, suggesting they are large proxies or NATs. Routing traffic through proxies thus provides better means for users who do not wish to be tracked.

### Summary
We study the cookie-churn phenomenon where privacy-aware users may clear cookies or switch to private browsing. By applying host-tracking results with other identifiers, service providers may still be able to identify a large fraction (88%) of the "one-time," churned new cookie IDs as corresponding to users who return to the service.

### 5 Application: Host Mobility Study
In addition to switching between IP addresses within the same network (e.g., due to DHCP), a host may also travel across different IP ranges. This can occur if the host is a mobile device or when a virtual private network (VPN) is used. We track hosts within each IP prefix range separately, though it is also desirable to study clients that travel across domains, e.g., for traffic engineering or network management. More importantly, host mobility patterns can benefit security. We demonstrate this point by applying our host-tracking results to detect abnormal and malicious activities.

To understand the mobile behavior of hosts at a large scale, we use cookie IDs, as they are more closely tied to specific devices than other identifiers. We use the Search dataset for our study. Among cookie IDs in this dataset, 7.9 million appeared at more than one domain. While the majority of these cross-domain activities are associated with normal user travel patterns, there also exist unusual or suspicious activities, such as cookie forwarding supported by CookieCooker [1].

In this section, we focus on detecting the following two abnormal host mobility patterns:

- **Some cookie IDs move quickly between multiple domains, suggesting they may not correspond to hosts who travel physically.** We study those cookies that may be associated with anonymous routing, such as Tor routing [37].
- **During an investigation into suspicious user email traffic that does not conform to the general host mobility profile, we uncover a stealthy type of malicious cookie-forwarding activity.**

First, we study patterns corresponding to users traveling across domains in general. We then use those patterns as a baseline to identify abnormal activities.

### 5.1 Host Mobility Patterns
Our analysis yields several key observations on general host mobility patterns. First, as shown in Table 6, ASes associated with cellular networks, such as Verizon Wireless and Carphone Warehouse Broadband Services, are ranked among the top domains with the largest number of traveling cookies. This reflects the proliferation of smartphones with mobile Internet access. In total, we find around 20% of the cookies among the top 500 AS pairs to be associated with cellular networks (Verizon Wireless, AT&T Wireless, Vodafone, Sprint, etc.).

| AS Pair | # Cookies | Affiliations |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| AS 17557, 45595 | 152871 | Pakistan Telecom (PK) |
| AS 6167, 22394 | 70941 | Verizon Wireless (US) |
| AS 13285, 43234 | 56600 | Opal Telecom, Carphone Warehouse Broadband (GB) |
| AS 4134, 4837 | 52520 | ChinaNet (CN) |
| AS 8228, 15557 | 36812 | Neuf Cegetel (FR) |

**Table 6.** Top five AS pairs associated with traveling cookies.

Second, we find traveling hosts to exhibit strong geographic locality. 83% of the cookies move between networks within the same country, and this number is even higher for the U.S. (95.44%). The strong geographic locality pattern can also be observed among cookies that travel across countries. Figure 7 shows the topology of international host travel, drawn from the top 500 AS pairs. The node "EU" represents multi-regional networks in the European Union, which are not exclusively part of any European country. The size of each node is proportional to the number of cookies that originated from that country or region. The edges indicate the direction of travel. The figure shows that host mobility is largely bi-directional and commonly localized within the same general region (e.g., Europe).

This concludes the detailed analysis of cookie churn and host mobility patterns, providing insights into the behavior of users and the challenges in tracking and securing online activities.
