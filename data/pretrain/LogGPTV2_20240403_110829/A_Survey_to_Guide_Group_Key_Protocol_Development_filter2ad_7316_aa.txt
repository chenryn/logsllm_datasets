Abstract
A large number of papers have proposed cryptographic pro-
tocols for establishing secure group communication. These
protocols allow a set of group members to exchange or es-
tablish keys to encrypt and authenticate messages within the
group. At the same time, individuals outside of the group
cannot eavesdrop on group communication or inject mes-
sages. There have even been usability studies, demonstrat-
ing an average user can successfully complete some of these
protocols. However, group protocols are rarely used in the
real world. In this work, we conduct a survey to help un-
cover why the general population ignores such mechanisms
for group communication. We also try to determine what
protocols would best match respondents’ current expecta-
tions for group protocols and methods for establishing trust.
Survey results indicate that a group protocol that leverages
location-limited channels, PKI, or Web-of-Trust authenti-
cated public keys and allows addition and deletion of mem-
bers fulﬁlls the majority of users’ expectations.
1 Introduction
Group key protocols allow a number of individuals to se-
curely exchange cryptographic keys or establish a shared
key using an insecure medium (e.g., wireless or Internet
connectivity). After forming a group, members can en-
crypt, decrypt, and authenticate messages to and from other
members of the group. Provided secure underlying cryp-
tography, no one outside of the group can eavesdrop on the
communication or inject a message that will successfully
authenticate. Prior works on group protocols [2, 5, 19, 21]
often use examples of collaborating researchers at a confer-
ence to motivate their work. In addition, the general pop-
ulation also naturally forms groups to communicate about
potentially secret information. Friends try to plan surprise
parties. Business partners collaborate on new projects. A
group of doctors may want to discuss a speciﬁc patient’s
condition. However, people rarely use group key protocols
to secure their communication. The goal of this work is to
uncover why “average users” do not use these protocols and
to determine which protocols match users’ mental models.
Prior work has shown users can successfully complete var-
ious tasks associated with many group security protocols
(i.e., password entry, string comparison, and data veriﬁca-
tion)
[20]. The goal of this work is to determine what
type of group protocols match users’ paradigms and what
functionality is necessary for adoption. Kuo et al. [13] an-
alyzed group protocols with respect to different social re-
quirements, but did not collect any end user data. Rather
than postulating what users’ want in a group key protocol,
we use a survey to help gain insight into users’ threat mod-
els and group interaction habits. To help answer the ques-
tion of why users ignore group protocols, our survey was
designed to help answer several sub-questions about group
communication: do people not worry about protecting their
communication, do current protocols not provide the neces-
sary group management functionality, and do people only
meet in scenarios where these protocols are inapplicable
(e.g., a protocol that uses infrared communication [4] ceases
to work when individuals communicate over the Internet).
Using responses to the survey, we can propose what type of
group key protocols best match current users’ practices.
Our results indicate that a large portion of respondents have
a very weak attacker model where attackers have limited ca-
pabilities and service providers and servers are trusted. Re-
spondents’ limited paranoia matches their practices in that
only a small fraction utilize security software to provide

end-to-end security for their current communication. Re-
sponses indicate that when dealing with current groups, re-
spondents require a mechanism that allows dynamic group
management (adding or removing members without hav-
ing to reform the group). When meeting in person, most
respondents trust third parties or physical interaction (e.g.,
exchanging business cards) to help verify online identities
that are encountered later. Such ﬁndings indicate location-
limited channels and public key based protocols correspond
with the majority of respondents’ trust models. When meet-
ing online, respondents did not agree on a single solution to
verify an identity. For successful adoption, online group
key protocols must accommodate multiple mechanisms to
establish trust or require a change in user paradigm.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we provide an overview of previous work. In Sec-
tion 3, we introduce our survey methodology. In Section 4,
we present the results from our survey and answer each of
the questions presented in the survey goals section (Sec-
tion 3.1). After presenting the survey results, Section 5 con-
tains guidance on what type of group key protocols would
match most survey respondents’ current group paradigms
and habits. We make concluding remarks in Section 6.
2 Previous Work
A large number of papers have been written on the problem
of group key establishment and exchange. Group key proto-
cols allow a number of individuals to exchange or establish
a shared key. Once every member of this group has a copy
of the key, group members can encrypt and authenticate
messages within the group. Prior works have focused on
making the protocols more efﬁcient (e.g., requiring fewer
rounds of communication [1, 19]) or proving security un-
der certain assumptions [7]. Our work focuses on the us-
ability of the protocols and examines what group structures
match users’ paradigms and what functionality is required
in a group key protocol. Only a limited number of other
works examine the usability of group key protocols. Uzun
et al. [20] examined the usability of pairing methods which
overlap with a number of the tasks involved in group pro-
tocols. Kuo et al. [13] performed a survey of group pro-
tocols and analyzed how different social scenarios warrant
different group mechanisms (i.e., friends sharing pictures
have different expectations and threat models than an un-
derground organization). Other works [8, 9] have examined
usability associated with encrypted emails.
Group key protocols can be divided into 4 different cat-
egories based on how trust is established: public key,
password, string comparison, and location-limited channel
based protocols. Public key based protocols [2, 5, 11, 12,
17, 18] rely on authenticated public keys. The group mem-
bers’ contributions are combined such that only a member
who contributed a key can calculate the shared group key.
If the public keys are not authenticated, a man in the middle
attack is possible [13]. Such authentication requires either
a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or a web-of-trust mech-
anism (i.e., the system used in PGP [23]) to ensure that
the public key one member receives corresponds to another
member’s actual contribution (as opposed to an attacker’s
contribution).
In password-based protocols, each member of the group
uses a shared short secret (i.e., a human memorable pass-
word) to encrypt their messages used to generate the group
key [1, 2, 7, 21]. Only a user with knowledge of the pass-
word can decrypt the messages and calculate the group’s
key. For this type of protocol to work the group must ﬁrst
distribute the password using some secure channel (e.g.,
a face-to-face meeting or phone call, or messages over a
trusted network such as a VPN).
Comparison-based group key protocols [6, 10, 14, 21, 22]
rely on detection of attacks. During the protocol any mem-
ber who contributes to the key can calculate the ﬁnal group
key. Unlike the public key or password-based schemes, an
attacker can inject and eavesdrop on all messages during a
comparison-based group key protocol. However, the last
stage of the protocol is a comparison of a checksum of the
protocol messages. If only valid members contribute to the
key generation, each member’s checksum will match. If an
attacker inserts a value, group members will have different
checksums, detect the attack, and rerun the protocol until
only group members contribute to the key calculation and
the checksums agree. Here members need a secure channel
for comparing checksums. When members meet in person
they can talk or show each other the checksum. If members
are in separate physical spaces, a trusted channel (e.g., cor-
porate VPN, trusted server, or policy-protected phone calls
or text messages) is necessary.
Location-limited channels reduce the burden on users in
group security protocols [4, 15, 16]. Rather than relying
on public keys, passwords, or string comparison to prevent
or detect attacks, these protocols leverage channels that are
infeasible for an attacker to control to communicate. These
channels include infrared, visual, and physical wires. These
protocols are mostly used for pairing two devices, but can
accommodate groups when one device acts as a commu-
nication hub to securely pass messages to all of the other
members’ devices. Balfanz et al. [3] introduced instant
PKIs (iPKIs) where the users uses a location-limited chan-
nel to learn about the certiﬁcate authority and acquire a cer-
tiﬁcate.
There has been only limited work on the human aspects as-
476476
sociated with group key protocols and secure communica-
tion. Uzun et al. [20] performed a usability analysis of a
number of pairing methods. In this work, they examined
what kind of error rates occur in a number of tasks, such as
string comparison, that are used in both pairing and group
protocols. Their results show that – with the right design
– users can successfully complete the necessary task 95%
of the time. Garﬁnkel et al. [8] found that in a study envi-
ronment, users will use secure email. However, a study by
Gaw et al. [9] found users considered the use of encrypted
communication “paranoid” and avoided its use for general
communication. Kuo et al. [13] examined different group
scenarios and proposed a number of guidelines and prop-
erties depending on the social situation related to a group.
For example, a group of friends would consider each other
peers and would prefer a leaderless group. However, busi-
nesses work in a hierarchy and expect some individual (e.g.,
a manager) to act as a leader in a project group. Kuo’s work
is closely related to our project in that both examine what
functionality would best support various real-world groups.
However, our work has the beneﬁt of feedback from a large
number of potential users.
3 Survey
3.1 Goals
We designed a survey to help us answer several questions
about why group key protocols are not widely used and
what functionality is needed to help spur adoption of these
protocols. We further break this issue down into a num-
ber of subquestions: 1) do people worry about protecting
their communication? 2) how do people currently manage
groups? and 3) how do group members meet and estab-
lish trust? The ﬁrst question helps determine why group
protocols are not used. The second and third questions
help deﬁne what functionality and methods, respectively,
are needed to help make group protocols consistent with
users’ current practices.
Users’ perceived threats and how users try to secure com-
munication are important factors when evaluating whether
the general population will adopt the use of group proto-
cols. If users feel their current communication is already
secure (i.e., attackers cannot access valid messages or forge
new messages), a user will simply send messages in the
clear rather than focusing on the secondary task of security.
However, if users recognize the potential threat and want
to secure communication, group protocols present a more
efﬁcient solution to security than pairwise keys.
How users manage groups deﬁnes the functionality neces-
sary in a group key protocol both during and after forma-
tion. We need to know if generating a new group makes
more sense than modifying a current group. If groups are
static, a protocol that only addresses group formation is ap-
propriate. However, if new members are often added or cur-
rent members are removed, users need a mechanism to ad-
just the group rather than constantly forming new groups.
How group members meet is a crucial factor in determin-
ing which group protocols are applicable and how users
think about establishing trust between members. If mem-
bers ﬁrst meet in person as a group, users can leverage
location-limited channels or comparison-based protocols to
establish a group key. If members ﬁrst meet in person but
at different times, users can exchange a password or lever-
age location-limited channels to securely exchange public
keys for later use during password or public key based pro-
tocols, respectively. If group members never meet directly,
a third party is needed to establish trust between members.
A trusted authority can act as a certifying authority and sign
each member’s public key. If group members trust mutual
friends, a web-of-trust will allow users to verify public keys.
3.2 Survey Design
To answer the questions from the previous section, we asked
respondents 9 open-ended and 14 multiple choice questions
using an online survey hosted on Survey Monkey1. We
asked open-ended questions to reduce any bias and allow re-
spondents to respond in ways we may have not considered.
The survey included questions on respondents’ current elec-
tronic communication and security habits, how respondents
manage groups, and how respondents meet and establish
trust with other individuals with which they communicate.
To determine how people currently communicate and pro-
tect that communication, we asked respondents several
questions about how frequently they use different electronic
communication mechanisms and how comfortable they feel
with each type of communication. We also tried to gauge
their perception of the secrecy of that communication – both
their beliefs about how difﬁcult it is for others to access their
communication and what steps they use to protect the com-
munication. Answers to these questions help us understand
what types of communication respondents are comfortable
using and respondents’ perceived need for and willingness
to use security techniques.
We used scenarios to determine how people currently man-
age groups. First, we asked respondents in which area of
their life would they most likely use online communication:
work, school, social situations, and personal ﬁnance. De-
pending on the response, we described a relevant scenario

and presented questions about forming a group, adding a
member to that group, and removing a member from that
group. The responses to these questions help us understand
what group management functionality is needed to match
respondents’ habits.
The last portion of the survey contained questions to help
determine how respondents meet other potential group
members and establish trust with them. Once we know how
respondents establish trust in their online correspondents,
we can infer what type of group protocol is most appropri-
ate. We focused on two general situations: when correspon-
dents meet in person before corresponding online, and when
correspondents ﬁrst meet online.
For correspondents that met in person, we wanted to deter-
mine how often the respondents meet in groups and how
they later conﬁrm the online identiﬁer matches the per-
son they met (e.g., verify screen-name “Jim2423” is really
James Smith from the meeting last week). If respondents
rarely meet in groups in person, group protocols will need
to utilize something other than comparison to secure the
group key (since those protocols assume the entire group
is simultaneously present). However, if respondents share a
password with potential group members when they meet in
person, password based protocols are applicable. If group
