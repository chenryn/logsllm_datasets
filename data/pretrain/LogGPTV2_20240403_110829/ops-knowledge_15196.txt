User: On my development system, I have Python 2.6, Django 1.1 and GAE.

I have three projects running on Python 2.6 and Django 1.1. 
I have 1 project using GAE, Python 2.6 and Django 1.1. 

I have heard that my set-up for running GAE using Python 2.6 may create some head-scratching problems while deploying it on the production server, because GAE supports only Python 2.5, and using 2.6 is not recommended.
Can I develop GAE application using Python 2.6? If not, what should I do? I am using Windows Vista as my development system.
Please note : I don't want to disturb my other projects in development, which uses Python 2.6 and Django 1.1.
Assistant: Unless you are using python 2.6 specific syntax/code your application is safe to run on GAE.
