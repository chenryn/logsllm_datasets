When using pd.ExcelWriter, it appears that calling the save method prevents
you from subsequently creating new sheets. E.g. see the following test script
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import os
    if __name__ == "__main__" :
        dates = pd.date_range('20130101', periods=6)
        df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6,4), index=dates, columns=list('ABCD'))
        currentpath = os.path.realpath(__file__)
        outputpath = os.path.join(currentpath, "..\\test.xlsx")
        writer = pd.ExcelWriter(outputpath)
        df.to_excel(writer, "thing1")
        writer.save() #if you remove this line it works as expected
        new_sheet = writer.book.add_worksheet("thing2")
        new_sheet.write(1,1,"test")
        print writer.book.sheetnames
        writer.save()
        writer.close()
