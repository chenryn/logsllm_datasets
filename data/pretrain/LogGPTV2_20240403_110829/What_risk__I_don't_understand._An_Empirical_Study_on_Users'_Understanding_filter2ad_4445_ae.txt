### 4. Results and Analysis

From the participants' comments, we observed that individuals with an IT background read security articles more carefully and spent more time reading the explanations provided in the pop-ups compared to those without an IT background.

The significance test revealed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) in the accuracy achieved with our tool between users with and without IT backgrounds. This indicates that while users with IT backgrounds face similar difficulties in comprehending security issues, they significantly outperform non-IT users when both groups use our tool.

Based on Experiment 2, we conclude:
- Our tool can help users understand security texts better, with a 30% improvement.
- Users have difficulty understanding ambiguous terms.
- Users with IT backgrounds show significantly better performance in understanding security texts, but only when using our tool.

### 5. Discussion

#### 5.1 Implications

**For Researchers:**
Our user studies were based on texts extracted from security blogs, which report the latest security trends, news, hacks, discoveries, vulnerabilities, and their solutions. If users can fully comprehend security articles, they are more likely to take reasonable actions to minimize risks when facing threats. Future research could explore other online and user-friendly public resources, such as videos, to enhance users’ security awareness and understanding. Our findings can also inspire researchers to investigate alternative viewpoints, such as difficulty level measures for technical terms, automatic self-explanations for security articles, or replacing technical terms with commonly used explanatory phrases.

**For IT Practitioners:**
Our findings suggest that users with IT backgrounds do not necessarily possess significantly more cybersecurity knowledge than those without. This is consistent with other research indicating that IT professionals may share confidential forms or download unreliable software without consulting security specialists [24]. Intermedia’s Insider Risk Report [28] revealed that tech-savvy workers are more likely to create security risks. IBM’s 2016 Cyber Security Intelligence Index found that 60% of cyber-attacks were caused by insiders, with 25% resulting from employee negligence [47]. It also reported that IT workers often overestimate their ability to defend against attacks. Therefore, security awareness programs for IT employees are highly important. Our tool can assist in enhancing users’ awareness and understanding.

**For Educators:**
Our survey results indicate that users have limited security knowledge to protect themselves from attacks. Educating users can improve their risk perception and understanding. Blogs are widely accessible and provide timely information. Our tool, designed with educational purposes in mind, helps users increase their security knowledge. With friendly integration into browsers, a convenient reading assistant promotes users’ interest in security news and articles. Additionally, security descriptions are often too technical and difficult for home users, such as security advice and privacy policy statements. Without appropriate explanations, users tend to skip crucial keywords. Our findings suggest that tools like our pop-up dictionary can help users quickly grasp the point of security advice and follow its instructions.

#### 5.2 Limitations

**User Study:**
Our SC Corpus was generated by human annotations from 200 representative articles, each averaging 1,000 words. Due to budget constraints, we recruited 597 crowd-workers to annotate the terms. Future work can employ more articles and annotators to build a larger corpus. The sample set in our study might not represent the same population diversity as more extensive sample sets. However, our analysis revealed significant differences between randomly divided groups, making this study instructive for future work involving a larger number of participants.

**Tool Development:**
The tool we developed is simple but effective. However, there is room for improvement. First, our pop-up windows are limited in size, and some terms have relatively long descriptions that are cut off. Future work can extract the most informative words or sentences to shorten the descriptions. Second, our tool may not perform well for newly created terms, as it is based on the SC corpus from the user study. Although we used over 40,000 technical articles from 2014 to the present, our tool can still be used in most current security articles. Future work can detect new terms based on similarity to our knowledge base. Finally, the evaluation method may introduce bias, as highlighted terms in the articles draw more attention. Since there is no real incentive for participants to answer correctly, the results might not reflect their best efforts. Future research should consider real-world practice.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we studied users’ understanding of security and their comprehension of security-related articles. We found that most participants had difficulty understanding the technical terms in these articles. Based on a crowdsourcing task, we generated a security-centric corpus with over five thousand terms. We also developed a tool to help users understand security articles by displaying meanings for technical terms in pop-ups. An experiment demonstrated that pop-up explanations greatly improved users’ security understanding. Our analysis also revealed that users with IT backgrounds did not understand security articles better or faster than those without IT backgrounds. Users’ misconceptions about cybersecurity issues may hinder the application of security controls or lead to misuse of security measures.

Inspired by our findings, we propose several future research directions. A larger number of crowd-workers can be employed to annotate more security articles, generating a broader and richer security-centric corpus. Future research should attempt to create refined meanings for the terms. Since end users have different levels of education, one solution is to provide personalized explanations. Instead of plain text, visual aids such as infographics can also be studied to explain security knowledge in a user-friendly way.
