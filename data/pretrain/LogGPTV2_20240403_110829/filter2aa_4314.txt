# Patience (RE, 769p)
This was a haskell reversing challenge. If this doesn't fill you with dread, this means that probably either:
- you are most 1338 pr0 xakep r3v3rse engineer ever living
- you don't comprehend the amount of horror that you're going to witness.
Either way, you're in for some serious fun. In fact, I've never seen anyone actually reverse engineer (non-trivial) haskell binary before - most challenges are actually solved with black-box workarounds or other side channels. This task is no different - we are given .cmm file along with compiled binary.
CMM files are dump of late-stage intermediate language from GHC. This is going to make our life way easier - we don't have to reverse haskell thunks, we have everything in plain text... well, sort of.
## How to be lazy
A word of introduction to the beautiful world of functional programming. Haskell is a lazy language. But not just your average slightly-procrastinating kind - everything is delayed as long as it possibly can be, and I mean it. For example, consider this function:
```haskell
integers n = n : integers (n+1)
```
if you don't speak Haskell, this is conceptually equivalent to following python code:
```python
def integers(n):
    return [n] + integers(n + 1)
```
Do you see anything wrong with this code? Exactly, this is not a terribly useful function - it'll recurse forever, or rather eat all your available stack space and explode. Not in Haskell though - you can call this function, take first 100 elements of the result, and get perfectly useful result - haskell is *lazy*, so only necessary elements will be evaulated.
But this still doesn't explain just how lazy Haskell is. Consider this:
```haskell
foo (2 + 2)
```
This is just invoaction of function `foo` with parameter `4`. Wait, wrong, I lied to you. The parameter is `2 + 2`, and it's not actually evaluated until it's needed. Hell, you could've passed `1 / 0` and nothing bad would happen, at least until something actually evaulates the parameter.
## Reversing
So, why the introduction? Well, this is how `main` function looks like in dump:
```
==================== Output Cmm ====================
[section ""data" . :Main.main_closure" {
     :Main.main_closure:
         const :Main.main_info;
         const 0;
         const 0;
         const 0;
 },
 :Main.main_entry() //  [R1]
         { info_tbl: [(c3bb,
                       label: :Main.main_info
                       rep:HeapRep static { Thunk })]
           stack_info: arg_space: 8 updfr_space: Just 8
         }
     {offset
       c3bb:
           _01D::P64 = R1;
           if ((Sp + 8) - 24  ?@[\\]^_`{|}~"

Not a lot of code, for huge binary that it produced, eh?
The problem is simple - `idx` function is very slow. But we can make it faster. I was too *lazy* to rewrite everything to my usual language of choice (python), so I just implemented faster version of `idx` straight in haskell:
```haskell
fsize' :: Int -> Integer
fsize' 0 = fromIntegral $ length s0
fsize' i = 2 * fsize (i - 1) + 3 * fsize 0
fsize :: Int -> Integer
fsize = memoize fsize'
idx' :: Index -> Char
idx' (Index i j) =
    if i == 0 then s0 !! j
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize0 then s1 !! j
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize1 then idx' $ Index (i - 1) (j - fromInteger fsize0)
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize2 then s2 !! (j - fromInteger fsize1)
    else if fromIntegral j < fsize3 then idx' $ Index (i - 1) (j - fromInteger fsize2)
    else s3 !! (j - fromInteger fsize3)
    where fsize0 = fsize 0
          fsize1 = fsize0 + fsize (i - 1)
          fsize2 = fsize1 + fsize0
          fsize3 = fsize2 + fsize (i - 1)
```
And that's basically it - after running reversed version, correct flag is produced in seconds:
```
N1CTF{did_cmm_helped?1109ef6af4b2c6fc274ddc16ff8365d1}
```
PS. Yes, it did.
