### Title: Cutting-Edge Security in Microsoft Edge â€” Insights from Those Who Have Explored It

**Abstract:**

Microsoft Edge, the default browser for Windows 10, is designed with a strong emphasis on security, featuring extensive sandboxing. In fact, it is one of the few browsers where the main process runs within a sandbox. Microsoft has gone to great lengths to develop and implement unique platform security features specifically for Microsoft Edge.

In this presentation, we will delve into the security architecture of Microsoft Edge, covering key aspects such as:
- Sandbox initialization
- Browser broker implementation
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- Renderer security isolation

We will also present two distinct bug chains that each consist of three vulnerabilities, which can be used to escape the logical sandbox. One of these chains was utilized in the Pwn2Own competition, while the other two are entirely new. These vulnerabilities are not traditional memory corruption bugs; instead, they exploit normal features of the browser and operating system.

This talk aims to provide deep insights into the security mechanisms of Microsoft Edge and highlight the complexities and challenges in securing modern web browsers.
