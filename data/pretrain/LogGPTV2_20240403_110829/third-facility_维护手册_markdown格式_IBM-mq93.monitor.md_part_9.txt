# TraceRoute PCF Group Parameters

## UnrecordedActivities (MQCFIN)
- **Description**: Specifies the number of unrecorded activities performed on behalf of the trace-route message.
- **Details**: An activity is considered unrecorded if an application that is enabled for trace-route messaging neither accumulates nor writes the related activity information to an activity report. The following circumstances lead to an unrecorded activity:
  - The detail level of the performed activity is less than the level specified by the `Detail` parameter.
  - The trace-route message requests an activity report but not accumulation, and the queue manager is not enabled for activity recording.
  - The trace-route message requests accumulation but not an activity report, and the queue manager is not enabled for trace-route messaging.
  - The trace-route message requests both accumulation and an activity report, and the queue manager is not enabled for either.
  - The trace-route message requests neither accumulation nor an activity report.
- **Increment**: For each unrecorded activity, the `UnrecordedActivities` parameter increments by one.

## DiscontinuityCount (MQCFIN)
- **Description**: Specifies the number of times the trace-route message has been routed through a queue manager with applications that were not enabled for trace-route messaging.
- **Increment**: This value is incremented by the queue manager. If this value is greater than 0, only a partial message route can be determined.

## MaxActivities (MQCFIN)
- **Description**: Specifies the maximum number of activities that can be performed on behalf of the trace-route message.
- **Total Activities**: The total number of activities is the sum of `RecordedActivities`, `UnrecordedActivities`, and `DiscontinuityCount`. The total must not exceed the value of `MaxActivities`.
- **Values**:
  - **Positive Integer**: The maximum number of activities. If exceeded, the trace-route message is rejected with feedback `MQFB_MAX_ACTIVITIES`.
  - **MQROUTE_UNLIMITED_ACTIVITIES**: An unlimited number of activities can be performed.

## Accumulate (MQCFIN)
- **Description**: Specifies the method used to accumulate activity information.
- **Values**:
  - **MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_IN_MSG**: Activity information is accumulated in the message data of the trace-route message. The message data includes the `TraceRoute` PCF group and zero or more `Activity` PCF groups.
  - **MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_AND_REPLY**: Activity information is accumulated in the message data, and a trace-route reply message is generated under specific conditions (e.g., message discarded, put to a local queue, or exceeds `MaxActivities`). The message data includes the `TraceRoute` PCF group and zero or more `Activity` PCF groups.
  - **MQROUTE_ACCUMULATE_NONE**: Activity information is not accumulated in the message data. The message data includes only the `TraceRoute` PCF group.

## Forward (MQCFIN)
- **Description**: Specifies where a trace-route message can be forwarded to.
- **Values**:
  - **MQROUTE_FORWARD_IF_SUPPORTED**: The trace-route message is only forwarded to queue managers that will honor the value of the `Deliver` parameter from the `TraceRoute` group.
  - **MQROUTE_FORWARD_ALL**: The trace-route message is forwarded to any queue manager, regardless of whether the value of the `Deliver` parameter will be honored.

## Deliver (MQCFIN)
- **Description**: Specifies the action to be taken if the trace-route message reaches its intended destination.
- **Values**:
  - **MQROUTE_DELIVER_YES**: On arrival, the trace-route message is put on the target queue. Any application performing a get operation on the target queue can retrieve the trace-route message.
  - **MQROUTE_DELIVER_NO**: On arrival, the trace-route message is not delivered to the target queue. The message is processed according to its report options.

## Setting Up a Common Queue for Trace-Route Reply Messages
- **Purpose**: To efficiently determine the locations of trace-route reply messages related to a specific message when reports are delivered to the local system queue.
- **Steps**:
  1. Select or define a queue manager as the single node.
  2. On the single node, select or define a queue for use as the common queue.
  3. On all queue managers that forward trace-route reply messages to the common queue, redefine the local system queue `SYSTEM.ADMIN.TRACE.ROUTE.QUEUE` as a remote queue definition.
     - Specify the name of the single node as the remote queue manager name.
     - Specify the name of the common queue as the remote queue name.

## Acquiring and Using Recorded Information
- **Techniques**:
  - **From Trace-Route Reply Messages**: Locate the trace-route reply message, retrieve it, and analyze the activity information.
  - **From Trace-Route Messages**: Locate the trace-route message, retrieve it, and analyze the activity information.
  - **From Activity Reports**: Locate and order the activity reports, then study the activity information.

## Additional Activity Information
- **Purpose**: User applications can record additional information by including one or more additional PCF parameters in the `Activity` group.
- **Parameters**:
  - **GroupName**: Grouped parameters specifying the additional information.
  - **ParameterName**: Contains the name to be displayed by the IBM MQ display route application.
  - **ParameterValue**: Contains the value to be displayed by the IBM MQ display route application.

## Examples of Recording Additional Activity Information
- **Example 1**: Additional activity information is recorded in a format where the parameter identifier is not recognized by the IBM MQ display route application.
- **Example 2**: Additional activity information is recorded in a format where the parameter identifier is recognized by the IBM MQ display route application.

## IBM MQ Display Route Application
- **Purpose**: Use the IBM MQ display route application (`dspmqrte`) to work with trace-route messages and activity information using a command-line interface.
- **Functions**:
  - Configure, generate, and put a trace-route message into a queue manager network.
  - Order and display activity information related to a trace-route message.
