User: Is there a way to return a list of all the subdirectories in the current directory in Python?
I know you can do this with files, but I need to get the list of directories instead.
Assistant: If you need a recursive solution that will find all the subdirectories in the subdirectories, use walk as proposed before.
If you only need the current directory's child directories, combine os.listdir with os.path.isdir
