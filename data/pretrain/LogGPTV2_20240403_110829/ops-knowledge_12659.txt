User: I used Homebrew to install python, the version is 2.7.10, and the system provided version is 2.7.6.  My PATH environment variable is set to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin", so my terminal DOES know to look at the Homebrew bin folder first! 
However, when I run python, it still defaults to 2.7.6, the system provided version (the interpreter that shows up says 2.7.6 at the top).  If I run /usr/local/bin/python, it runs 2.7.10, which is what I want. 
If my PATH variable is properly set, then how is it possible that terminal still finds /usr/bin/python first?
Assistant: This happened to me when I installed Python 2.7.10 using brew. My PATH was set to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin and which python returned /usr/local/bin/python (which is symlinked to Python 2.7.10.)
Problem went away when I closed and restarted Terminal application.
