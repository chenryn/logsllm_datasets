### Abstract
This paper explores the potential for online activities and data disclosures to compromise the privacy and security of individuals, including high-profile figures such as presidents and prime ministers, as well as average citizens. It examines various vectors of information disclosure, cross-site tracking, and user motivations, and provides solutions and countermeasures to mitigate these risks.

3. **Cross-site Tracking**
   - Advertising and Embedded Content
4. **User Motivation**
   - Survey Results
5. **Solutions and Countermeasures**

### Information Disclosure
#### Computing Platform
- **Personal Computers**: ~1.2 billion
- **Mobile Devices**: ~3.3 billion cell phones, ~220 million MP3 players, ~120 million digital cameras, ~100 million webcams, ~85 million PDAs, ~44 million DVRs, ~27 million servers
- **Data Collection**: Online companies and ISPs collect extensive data from users, including search queries, emails, and browsing history.

#### Network Eavesdropping
- **ISP vs. Online Companies**:
  - **ISPs**:
    - See all traffic from their customers, except encrypted traffic.
    - Know the identity and location of accounts.
    - Can manipulate network flows (e.g., DNS, blocking P2P).
  - **Online Companies**:
    - See global traffic from many customers, domain-specific.
    - Limited knowledge of user identity.
    - Extensive data mining and advertising capabilities.

#### Destination Websites
- **Third-Party Content and Web Bugs**: Many websites embed third-party content that can track user activity across multiple platforms.
- **Case Studies**:
  - **Craigâ€™s List, eBay, Amazon, Hotmail**: Emails and transactions on these platforms are often compromised.
  - **Social Networking Sites (e.g., LinkedIn)**: These sites know your contacts and their contacts, potentially linking diverse groups of users.
  - **Mapping Services (e.g., MapQuest, EveryScape)**: Reveal locations of interest, allowing diverse groups of users to be linked.

### Vectors of Information Leakage
- **Email**: A major vector for information leakage.
- **Search**: Search engines and related services (e.g., Google) collect extensive data.
- **Mobile Phones**: Increasingly used for sensitive communications.
- **FTP Replacement, Web Office Suites, Mapping**: Various online tools and services can also leak information.

### Cross-site Tracking
- **Web Analytics**: Tools like Google Analytics collect detailed user data.
- **Embedded Content**: Web bugs, YouTube videos, and other embedded content can track user behavior.
- **Advertising**: Services like DoubleClick and AdSense use referer data and JavaScript libraries for click-through tracking.
- **Example**: A visit to MSNBC.com involves interactions with 16 third-party sites and 10 separate companies.

### User Motivation
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Users, webmasters, and bloggers often weigh short-term gains against long-term risks.
- **Trust and Awareness**: The key factors in whether users disclose information online.
- **Survey Results**: Surveys indicate that users are often unaware of the extent of their data disclosure.

### Solutions and Countermeasures
#### Patching Users
- **Raised Awareness**: Educating users about the risks of online activities.
- **Know What You are Disclosing**: Understanding the data being shared.
- **Usable Security**: Making security measures more user-friendly.

#### Technical Countermeasures
- **Cookie Managers**: Managing and controlling cookies.
- **Content Filtering**: Blocking malicious or unnecessary content.
- **Self-Monitoring**: Regularly checking and managing online presence.
- **Search Term Chaffing**: Adding irrelevant terms to searches to confuse data collection.
- **Encryption**: Using encryption for sensitive communications.
- **Anonymizing Proxies**: Using proxies to hide IP addresses.
- **Tor**: Anonymizing internet traffic.
- **NAT Firewalls**: Network Address Translation firewalls for additional security.

#### Policy Countermeasures
- **Petition Law and Policy Makers**: Advocating for stronger privacy laws.
- **Support Privacy Organizations**: Supporting organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

### Conclusions
- **Data Possession vs. Data Sharing**: What online companies possess and what they share are two different things. For example, Google may blur street views and maps but still retain internal search logs.
- **Future Countermeasures**: Developing plugins to monitor information disclosures and display third-party contacts can help users better manage their online privacy.
