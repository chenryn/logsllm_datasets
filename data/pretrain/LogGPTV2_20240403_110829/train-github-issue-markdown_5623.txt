I'm using Symfony Process to execute wp-cli commands and one of them was
something like this:
    wp post create --post_title="Hello VersionPress!" --post_date="2011-11-11 11:11:11"
If I executed this command on Windows `cmd` it worked fine but when Symfony
Process ran it, the post title was created as "Hello VersionPress11:11" and
the data was generally not right, even though the command technically
succeeded (no error).
After some experimenting, it seems that **the exclamation mark is somehow a
problem**. When I removed it, all worked fine. Is that a bug in Symfony
Process on Windows or maybe some kind of misconfiguration on my side?
