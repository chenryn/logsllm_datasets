User: Explain what containerization is and how it is used in modern software development.
Assistant: Containerization is a method of packaging an application and all its dependencies together. Its purpose is to make the system easier to deploy, manage and scale. Containerization technology can realize the advantages of rapid software deployment, cross-platform operation, resource isolation, and efficient use of server resources. In modern software development, containerization technology has become a very important tool. Containerization can provide DevOps teams with a powerful tool to quickly build, test and deploy applications. Containerization makes application deployment more flexible and can be easily deployed in different scenarios. Containerization can also precisely control resource scheduling between applications, avoiding competition between different applications. In addition, containerization can also run in multiple environments, so that developers do not need to make too many adaptations and modifications to different environments. Containerization can also optimize the resource usage of the system. For example, multiple containers can be run on the same server to achieve a higher level of resource sharing and utilization. The use of containerization technology not only improves the efficiency of software development, but also reduces costs and provides better quality assurance.
