ABSTRACT
Cellular data links are an eﬀective outdoor Internet access
solution in urban environments. In this paper, we evaluate
cellular data service as a potential data communication so-
lution for oil ﬁeld crews operating at remote areas in the
United States. In our study, we ﬁrst record the performance
of cellular data service at twelve oil ﬁeld locations. Measure-
ment results show extensive availability of cellular service
at those locations making it potentially a data communica-
tion solution at ﬁeld locations. We then design a measure-
ment framework and deploy measurement units to ﬁve oil
ﬁeld crews and carry out a side-by-side comparison of two
diﬀerent satellite links and cellular links from two service
providers. Analysis of data sets consisting of more than 300
days’ measurement shows that the cellular link has compara-
ble or even higher availability than conventional satellite link
at many ﬁeld operations. However, the quality of its cover-
age is location dependent. This indicates that both cellular
and satellite links should be used to provide highly available
and cost-eﬀective data communication for such operations.

desirable between oil ﬁeld locations and applications on the
Internet or inside an enterprise network infrastructure. For
example, important job parameters during a ﬁeld job can be
sent to a data server where clients are able to view the job
progress and provide feedback/comments. After the 2010
Macondo well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico [1], stricter
governmental regulations introduced new data communica-
tion requirements to ﬁeld operations. For example, status of
oilﬁeld equipment should be reported to a data center reg-
ularly. Since most ﬁeld operations are conducted in remote
areas, satellite links have been considered as the only option
for a long time. With limited bandwidth provisioning and
expensive usage cost, we are evaluating data communication
alternatives from ﬁeld operations to the Internet, in particu-
lar, to servers inside our Schlumberger Information Network
(SINet).
Recent research evaluated outdoor Internet access from
vehicles using 3G cellular service [2–4]. High bandwidth
and stable connectivity from 3G data links exist at all those
areas. However, all these studies were conducted in urban
regions where cellular tower deployment density is high. Per-
formance of cellular data links at remote areas far from cel-
lular towers has not been evaluated in depth.
In this paper, we explore the potential for less costly cel-
lular data usage at remote sites where such usage has not
traditionally been contemplated.
It is clear that there is
signiﬁcant diversity in availability of cellular and satellite
coverage among remote locations. We provide a framework
for assessing this availability through systematic measure-
ment and analyze results from this framework at diﬀerent
geographical locations.
We ﬁrst conducted a series of performance measurements
of cellular data links with a ﬁeld trip covering twelve re-
mote operation locations. Coverage and link characteristics
were collected at those locations. Based on analysis of col-
lected information in this trip, we designed the measurement
framework and deployed ﬁve testing units to ﬁeld crews to
collect performance data of cellular and satellite links over a
total time period of more than 300 days. To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst side-by-side comparison between cellular data
link and satellite links at remote areas.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related work
is described in Section 2. We introduce our measurement
setup and test scenarios in Section 3 and present analysis
of measurement results in Section 4. This paper concludes
in Section 5 with summary of ﬁndings and plans of future
work.

2.1 Wireless Communication at Oil Fields
Modern oil ﬁeld operations from exploration to production
require a signiﬁcant amount of interactions between software
and hardware as well as collaboration among ﬁeld person-
nel. Providing data communication at ﬁeld locations is not
only essential but critical. Wireless technology has been
widely adopted since most of oil ﬁeld operations are con-
ducted at locations where a conventional wired network in-
frastructure is physically or ﬁnancially impractical. Wireless
LAN (WLAN) and two-way radio are common equipment of
ﬁeld crews with high mobility nowadays. And wireless com-
munication technology continues extending its reach at oil
ﬁeld operations [5, 6]. Correlation between transfer delay
and TCP packets’ size over GPRS link is studied in [7] for
a potential application of real-time oil ﬁeld monitoring.
2.2 Outdoor Internet Access
Studies of outdoor data access mainly focus on connectiv-
ity from moving vehicles. This connectivity can be provided
via open WiFi APs [8, 9]. Due to the limited communica-
tion range of those APs and their uncoordinated coverage,
handoﬀs with predictive methods and using prefetching to
download experience were discussed in [10]. Cellular data
service is also considered as a good source for outdoor data
access because of its better coverage and less frequent service
interruptions. Using tools from information theory, the work
in [4] shows a certain level of predictability of bandwidth on
3G links in a metro area. Most recently, performance com-
parisons between WiFi and 3G connectivity is conducted in
urban areas. Although these two types of data links have
diﬀerent characteristics, they can be good supplements to
each other based on studies in [2, 3].
2.3 Cell and Satellite Links Characterization
Cellular data service providers normally apply sophisti-
cated control/scheduling method in their networks. The
conﬁguration can be highly customized from location to lo-
cation due to quality of service (QoS) and business concerns
[11]. Empirical study of transport layer performance over
those managed cellular data links are reported in [12–14].
Satellite networks are under strict regulation and man-
agement due to the expensive and limited bandwidth over
such links. Research on satellite links focuses on measur-
ing TCP’s performance over those links and “tuning” the
TCP protocol stack to ﬁt link characteristics such as long
end-to-end latency [15–17].
3. MEASUREMENT SETUP
The objective of this work is to evaluate new communi-
cation opportunities from oil ﬁeld locations to the Internet
provided by rapidly expanding cellular data service across
the continental USA. In the ﬁrst phase of our study, we
conducted a series ﬁeld tests in northern Texas/Louisiana.
During these tests, we evaluated cellular data links on their
availability and average TCP throughput. With positive re-
sults in this study, we deployed test units to ﬁve crews and
conducted the second phase of the study. We compare cel-
lular data services and satellite links side-by-side at remote
ﬁeld locations. Our measurement studies target an answer
to the question of whether we can cost-eﬀectively improve
the connectivity from remote oilﬁeld operations to the In-
ternet at certain geographical regions.
3.1 Hardware Platform
During the ﬁrst phase of the study, we built a mount so
that two vertical masts were setup on each back corner of
a pick up truck. This allowed us to position antennas at
a 4-meter elevation above the ground. This matches the
elevation of those antennas in ﬁeld deployments where they
are installed on the roof of trailers.
We use two dual-band ﬂexible omnidirectional antennas.
The choice of this type of antenna stems from a speciﬁc
oilﬁeld operational restriction: The cellular antenna on the
roof of trailers must be ﬂexible to prevent damage caused by
strong vibrations or impacts from vegetation when ﬁeld op-
eration are carried out at places with harsh road conditions.
This restriction rules out many other choices such as elec-
tronically steerable antennas [18]. The gain of this ﬂexible
antenna is 5 dB as higher gain antennas are usually longer
and associated with a higher probability of breakage during
ﬁeld operations. The AT&T and Verizon 3G modems used
in our measurement studies come with one or two (Veri-
zon model) external antenna connectors. Both antenna and
cellular data modems installation pass our internal environ-
mental qualiﬁcation procedure, which involves tests for con-
ditions such as strong vibration and extreme temperature.
A diﬀerent communication system setup was used in the
second phase study. We installed a cellular data modem and
a BGAN modem from Inmarsat [19] on trailers of ﬁve ﬁeld
crews which used the VSAT modem from iDirect [20] as the
data access link to the Internet.
Cellular and satellite data modems are connected to a
Dell LatitudeTMlaptop via Ethernet port or USB/Ethernet
Windows R(cid:2)
converter. Our measurement application is running on the
3.2 Methodology
XP operating system.
In our phase one study, we visited 12 ﬁeld-operation lo-
cations. A commercial Internet speed test server [21] and
an internal link speed test server inside SINet were used to
measure the upload/download link speed.
If data service
was available, the average link speed was recorded. Data
service coverage and link speed of both service providers
were evaluated. Good coverage revealed during this study
led us to continue further comparison between cellular and
satellite links in ﬁeld locations.
In our test unit deployed on ﬁeld crew’s trailer, we devel-
oped an application to probe for Internet access over each
data link every 30 seconds. Furthermore, when the ﬁeld crew
started the ﬁeld operations, data ﬁles with a size of 1 MByte
are generated regularly. This is to mimic data generation
from a planned application for ﬁeld service-quality improve-
ment. Our application automatically uploaded those ﬁles
to a FTP server inside SINet over an available data link.
Interrupted uploading was resumed when the connectivity
was restored. Each FTP transmission’s size and duration
was recorded and used to compute average TCP through-
put at that time.
Throughout our measurement studies, we used the origi-
nal TCP stack of the Windows operating system. Our re-
sults can serve as the basis for future eﬀort on “tuning” the
TCP stack for performance improvement over cellular or
satellite links.
118End-to-end latency is the link metric which essentially af-
fects TCP stack’s performance and determines service qual-
ity experienced by many applications. To collect end-to-end
latency measurement results, periodical ping’s are sent over
cellular and satellite links.
3.3 Switching between Network Interfaces
In order to send probe traﬃc through each network in-
terface, we developed an interface switching mechanism at
application layer by manipulating the Windows operating
system’s local routing table.
Diﬀerent IP addresses are assigned by DHCP protocols on
each of these three interfaces. For example, 192.168.1.100 is
the IP address at the interface connected to a satellite data
modem which serves as the gateway with the IP address
192.168.1.1. In the meanwhile, 192.168.2.100 is the IP ad-
dress assigned by a cellular data modem with IP address
192.168.2.1.

By setting a routing table entry for all IP addresses, i.e.,
destination IP is 0.0.0.0 shown in Figure 1, all network traf-
ﬁc is forwarded onto the cellular link. Note that a more
speciﬁc routing table entry can be created at the same time
to specify which interface should be used for the network
application with a pre-determined destination IP address.
In Figure 1’s example, the application with a destination IP
address 10.0.0.1 is using the satellite link.
