User: Is it possible to run Tornado such that it listens to a local port (e.g. localhost:8000). I can't seem to find any documentation explaining how to do this.
Assistant: If you want to daemonize tornado - use supervisord. If you want to access tornado on address like http://mylocal.dev/ - you should look at nginx and use it like reverse proxy. And on specific port it can be binded like in Lafada's answer.
