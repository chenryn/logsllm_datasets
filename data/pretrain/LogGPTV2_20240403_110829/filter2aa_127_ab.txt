### Development Oversight and Use
- **Development Oversight**
- **Use**
- **Reparations for Malicious Elicitation or Misuse**

### Who Should Be In Charge of Regulation and When?
#### Summary of Results: Policy and Responsibility
- **Independent Regulatory Organizations, Legislators, and Device Manufacturers** should be more involved throughout the development and reparations process.
- **Users** should be least involved in reparations from misuse, while **Device Manufacturers** should be the most involved.

### Examples of Policy Solutions
- **Increased involvement by legislators** in reparations for malicious elicitation or misuse.
- **Federal or state-level right to neural privacy legislation** (or broader generic/biometric data privacy legislation).
- **Provide reparations by statute** (monetary, private right of action, etc.).
- **Empower regulatory agencies** like the FTC.
- **Involvement of Independent Regulatory Organizations**.
- **Accountability for device manufacturers**.
- **Overall, how do consumers understand the risks of using a device?**

### Here’s My Ask of You
#### The Main Takeaways

### To the Developers in the Room
- **Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.**
- **Ask yourself what problem you’re solving, how else you can obtain that information, and what is the least amount of information you need to complete a particular task.**
- **Do as much processing as possible locally/on the device.**

### To the Privacy-Conscious in the Room
- **Avoid using these kinds of devices.**
- **You may feel better with a slower screen refresh rate to prevent subliminal elicitation.**
- **Advocate for comprehensive US federal data privacy legislation.**
- **Read the terms of service to find out what happens to your biometric information.**

### To the 3-Letter Agencies in the Room
- **(Yes, I know you’re here.)**
- **If you’re even thinking about using this kind of technique for interrogation, you must address serious ethical and legal questions.**
- **This technology is still in its infancy and should not be considered the ultimate solution to any problem.**
- **Existing neural imaging (like fMRI) isn’t admissible as evidence in US courts because it is still considered an emerging and unproven technology.**
- **Scientists got statistically significant results from a dead salmon in an fMRI, so how do you know that you’re actually getting good intelligence?**

### Backup Slides

### Is Privacy a Right or an Interest? Part 1
- **The term “right” is often synonymous with a guarantee, even if there is no legal remedy for an infraction or harm.**
- **There is renewed interest in a right to privacy given our current internet ecosystem and the lack of control over our information.**
- **Without appropriate remedies, there is no right.**
- **Is there different language we can use to describe what we are owed, if anything, with respect to our privacy?**

### Is Privacy a Right or an Interest? Part 2
- **Thomson: There is no right to privacy—rather, what we think of as a right to privacy is just a collection of different, but related, rights.**
- **DeCew: If privacy is instead an interest, it can still be protected or invaded, and discussed without justifying why or how it should be observed.**
- **The fact that there is no overarching and defined statutory right to privacy means it will continue to be infringed upon like an interest, or ignored.**

### Do We Own Our Own Thoughts?
- **Is ownership necessary to assert a privacy claim? Inness says no.**
- **The construct of ownership may only be necessary if there is a value (monetary or otherwise) to the thought.**
- **It may be difficult to know the value of a “thought” until something is done with it.**
- **If ownership is assigned:**
  - **It’s easier to create a legal construct to protect the person eliciting information and the company receiving it.**
  - **But it’s also more difficult if the wrong information is elicited.**
  - **The purpose for eliciting information should be important to questions of ownership.**

### What Relationship Do We Have With Those Who Elicit Information Neurally?
- **Defining the relationship between the user and the company.**
- **Intimacy: specification that choice is involved on the part of the agent providing information, and that the value comes from the original relationship one has with the information (Inness).**
- **When information is elicited not by choice, the violation of privacy can be linked to a lack of acknowledging that the sharing of information is, in fact, a relationship.**

### The Importance of Trust
- **Lack of trust may no longer be an adequate deterrent to a company’s malevolent behavior.**
- **91% of Americans in 2016 agreed or strongly agreed that users had lost control over the collection and use of their information.**
- **2/3rd of those surveyed in 2017 said that existing legislation is inadequate in protecting private information.**
- **Privacy as trust (Waldman): relationship through regulation of access, either restricting or openness.**

### First Analysis: Person vs App
- **Odds ratio 1: non-mobility impaired individuals perceived data collected to be more of a privacy violation, compared to those who are.**

### Message Text
- **Record Typing**
- **Brain Activity**
- **Planned Brain Activity**
- **Brain Activity + Emotional State**
- **Odds Ratios: 0.95, 0.96, 1.24, 1.76, 1.70**

### First Analysis: Involvement by Entity
- **How should each entity’s involvement change through the BCI lifecycle?**
- **Odds ratio > 1 means less involvement through each stage.**
- **Odds ratio < 1 means involvement should increase going from user to device manufacturer.**

### More Involved
- **User**
- **Researcher**
- **Independent Regulatory Organizations**
- **Legislators**
- **Manufacturers**
- **Compared to Current Involvement**
- **Odds Ratios: 1.461, 1.536, 0.620**
