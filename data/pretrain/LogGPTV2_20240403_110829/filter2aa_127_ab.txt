• Use
• Reparations for malicious 
elicitation or misuse

Who Should Be In Charge of Regulation and When?
Summary of Results:
Policy and Responsibility
• Independent Regulatory Organizations, Legislators, and Device 
Manufacturers should be more involved going from development to 
reparations for misuse
• Users should be least involved in reparations from misuse, while Device 
Manufacturers should be the most involved
73
Examples of Policy Solutions
• Increased involvement by legislators with reparations for malicious 
elicitation or misuse
• Federal or state-level right to neural privacy legislation (or broader 
generic/biometric data privacy legislation)
• Provide reparations by statute (monetary, private right of action, etc.)
• Empower regulatory agencies like the FTC

Here’s My Ask of You
The Main Takeaways

To the Developers in the Room
• Just because you can doesn’t mean you should
• Ask yourself what problem you’re solving, how else you can obtain that
information, and what is the least amount of information you need to 
complete a particular task

1. Is Privacy a Right or an Interest? Part 1
• The term “right” is often synonymous with a guarantee, 
even if there is no legal remedy for an infraction or harm
93
1. Is Privacy a Right or an Interest? Part 1
• The term “right” is often synonymous with a guarantee, 
even if there is no legal remedy for an infraction or harm
• There is renewed interest in a right to privacy given our 
current internet ecosystem and the lack of control over 
our information

• Is there different language we can use to describe what we 
are owed, if anything, with respect to our privacy?
96
1. Is Privacy a Right or an Interest? Part 2
• Thomson: There is no right to privacy—rather, what we think 
of as a right to privacy is just a collection of different, but 
related, rights

• Thomson: There is no right to privacy—rather, what we think 
of as a right to privacy is just a collection of different, but 
related, rights
• DeCew: If privacy is instead an interest, it can still be protected 
or invaded, and discussed without justifying why or how it 
should be observed

• DeCew: If privacy is instead an interest, it can still be protected 
or invaded, and discussed without justifying why or how it

• The fact that there is no overarching and defined statutory right 
to privacy means it will continue to be infringed upon like an 
interest, or ignored

2. Do We Own Our Own Thoughts?
• Is ownership necessary to assert privacy claim?  Inness says no

• The construct of ownership may only be necessary if there is a value 
(monetary or otherwise) to the thought
• It may be difficult to know the value of a “thought” until something is 
done with it
• If ownership is assigned:
• It’s easier to create a legal construct to protect the person eliciting information, 
and the company receiving it
• But it’s also more difficult of the wrong information is elicited

3. What Relationship Do We Have With Those 
Who Elicit Information Neurally?
• Defining the relationship between the user and the company
105
3. What Relationship Do We Have With Those 
Who Elicit Information Neurally?
• Defining the relationship between the user and the company
• Intimacy: specification that choice is involved on the part of the agent 
providing information, and that the value comes from the original 
relationship one has with the information (Inness)

3. What Relationship Do We Have With Those 
Who Elicit Information Neurally?
• Defining the relationship between the user and the company
• Intimacy: specification that choice is involved on the part of the agent 
providing information, and that the value comes from the original 
relationship one has with the information (Inness)
• When information is elicited not by choice, the violation of privacy can 
be linked to a lack of acknowledging that the sharing of information is in 
fact a relationship
107
4. The Importance of Trust
• Lack of trust may no longer be an adequate deterrent to a company’s 
malevolent behavior
• 91% of Americans in 2016 agreed or strongly agreed that users had lost control 
over the collection and use of of their information
• 2/3rd of those surveyed in 2017 said that existing legislation is inadequate in 
protecting private information
