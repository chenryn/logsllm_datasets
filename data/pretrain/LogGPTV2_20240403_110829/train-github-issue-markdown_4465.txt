### Electron Version
15.0.0

### Operating System
Windows 10

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
13.1.7

### Expected Behavior
The CSS property `-webkit-app-region: drag` should allow the window to be moved by dragging the specified region.

### Actual Behavior
The CSS property `-webkit-app-region: drag` does not enable the window to be moved by dragging the specified region.

### Testcase Gist URL
_No response_

### Additional Information
I created a `BrowserWindow` with the following configuration:
```javascript
{
    frame: false,
    width: 315,
    minWidth: 315,
    height: 485,
    minHeight: 485,
    resizable: false,
    maximizable: false,
    webPreferences: {
        nodeIntegration: true,
        preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js")
    }
}
```
In the window, there is a `div` with the following style:
```css
-webkit-app-region: drag;
```

However, this `div` does not allow the window to be moved by dragging. After some testing, I found that setting `resizable: false` was causing the issue. Setting `movable: true` did not resolve the problem.
