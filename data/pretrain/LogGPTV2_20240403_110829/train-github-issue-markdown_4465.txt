### Additional Information
I created a BrowserWindow with this configuration
    {
            frame: false,
            width: 315,
            minWidth: 315,
            height: 485,
            minHeight: 485,
            resizable: false,
            maximizable: false,
            webPreferences:{
                nodeIntegration: true,
                preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js")
            }
    }
In the window there was a div with this style: `-webkit-app-region: drag`  
But he not moves this window
After some tests I found out that the property ` resizable: false` was what
caused the problem and the property  
`movable: true` does not fix the error
Sorry for the poor English I'm not fluent :)
