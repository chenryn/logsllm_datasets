User: All connections of PostgreSQL are occupied, how to quickly locate and solve this problem?
Assistant: 1. View the current number of connections Use the following command to view the current number of connections: ```bash SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity; ``` You can judge whether there is a problem of connection occupation by comparing the current number of connections with the maximum number of connections. If the current number of connections has reached the maximum number of connections, it means that a connection is occupied. 2. View the process that occupies the connection Use the following command to view the process id and query statement that occupy the connection: ```bash SELECT pid, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state='idle in transaction'; ``` Through this command, you can view all A connection in the "idle in transaction" state, that is, a transaction that has started but has not been committed or rolled back, may occupy the connection until the end of the transaction. 3. Forcibly close the process that occupies the connection. If it is determined that a connection has been occupied and the transaction has not ended in time, you need to close the process of the connection through the following steps: 1. Find out the process id that occupies the connection (already in the previous step 2. Use the following command to terminate the process that occupies the connection: ```bash SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid); ``` This command will forcefully close the process with the specified pid, but it should be noted that this command will forcefully close the process All the operations being performed include the statements executed by the process and all operations in the current transaction. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm that closing the process will not affect the database before performing operations. 4. Adjust the parameters to increase the number of connections. If the number of connections is insufficient and the connection is occupied, you can also consider increasing the maximum number of connections to solve the problem. In the postgresql.conf file, the max_connections parameter can be modified to increase the maximum number of connections, but it should be noted that increasing the number of connections consumes more system resources, so it is necessary to balance the requirements of system resources and the number of connections.
