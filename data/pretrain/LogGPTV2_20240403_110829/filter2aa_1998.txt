What do all of these publications have in common?
 Seven books, one magazine
 Three bestsellers, five not
 They were all originally 
   published without the
   backing of a major 
   publishing house.

Background – what is self-publishing?
 Definitions – self vs. vanity publishing
 “Self-publishing is the publishing of books and other media by the 
authors of those works, rather than by established, third-party publishers…”
– "Self-publishing." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 13 Jun 2007, 23:42 UTC. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 30 Jun 2007 
.
 “A vanity press or vanity publisher is a book printer which, while 
claiming to be a publisher, charges writers a fee in return for publishing their 
books or otherwise makes most of its money from the author rather than from 
the public.”
– "Vanity press." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 5 Jun 2007, 11:14 UTC. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 30 Jun 2007 
.
 Analogous to shareware/freeware
 Author maintains control
 Author receives most/all proceeds
 Often niche-oriented

Content – what to convey?
 Is my work good enough?
 Yes.
 Everyone has a book/article/song/painting/etc. in them somewhere
 If you do not think that you are that original/good, maybe your friend is
 But…
 Getting sued is bad – intellectual property rights are key
 Original content
 Write what you know – clichéd but true
 Example:  Commodork
 Previously published content for which you own or can obtain the rights
 A plethora of underground-related content is just waiting to be republished for mass 
consumption – even if you can already download it all for free

Investment – aside from content, what is needed?
 Audience
 Less important than content
 Time (which equals money, as we all know)
 Money – depends on the avenue you pursue
 Online is cheaper than offline
 ISBN – ~$25, for books/DVDs/individual issues of serials
 May not be necessary, depending on where you want to sell
 In general, must be purchased in blocks of 10
 May be purchased from self-publishing site at a markup, ie. lulu.com
 ISSN – free, for serials only
 UPC – $89, for all types of products
 Print-on-demand
 Very little cost
 No inventory to manage
 Could be free (unless you buy a copy for yourself)
 Short press run
 Minimum lot quantities of 500-1000 (usually)
 Slightly better print/binding quality

Publishing – which site(s) to use?
*DISCLAIMER:  Both Commodork and The Book of Cao were published through Lulu.  We’re not endorsing

 Making friends = making sales
 Use every contact you have

 Common trap:  writing for marketing
 Solution:  market the writing, don’t write for the market
 Thinking about marketing first is like writing pop music

ROI – how many copies can I expect to sell?
 To profit or not to profit?
 Are you writing/publishing to make money or to get your idea(s) out there?
 You can sell “at cost”
 Naturally, you can mark up that price for a profit
 Printing is so cheap that margins can be very high (e.g., 32% for The Book of Cao)
 Regardless, you are not likely to get rich by self-publishing
 Sales depend on audience and availability of similar products
 Print on demand works can, theoretically, be available forever with little-to-
no inventory
 Indefinite availability allows the audience to find the work

ROI (cont.)
 The average self-published book sells approximately 200 copies over its 
lifetime*
 Commodork = ~500 copies in  10 years
 Dark Domain DVD-ROM = ~800 copies in ~ 3 years
 Its content was available at artpacks.acid.org for several years

Reviews – there really is no such thing as bad press
 Good reviews come from people who are excited about you and your 
product
 Never stop promoting
 We are still being reviewed a year later – this takes time
 Find “target” websites (ie. sites whose users would be interested)
 Provide copies in exchange for reviews
 Contact websites/zines/newspapers
 Offer interviews
 Provide electronic/PDF copies for reviews
 Take people's positive feedback/e-mail/comments, use as a review
 Use contacts (friends, writers, etc.) who can review your product
 Make sure you have all of your ducks in a row before soliciting reviews
 Website set up
 Ready for orders
