Hello,
I'm dealing with an issue specific to TypeScript on a Backbone project, but
this seems more generic to any project using underscore/lodash and the return
of the `_.result` method:
    // With _.result you can work with an object property or function...
    return _.isFunction(value) ? value.call(object) : value;
Is it possible to have a TypeScript interface definition that includes an
instance property that can optionally be overridden with an instance method?
Example from Backbone's .d.ts file to include both:
    url: any
    url(): any
Currently this produces an error for a duplicate identifier.
Thanks!
