ABSTRACT
Online advertisements (ads) provide a powerful mechanism for ad-
vertisers to effectively target Web users. Ads can be customized
based on a user’s browsing behavior, geographic location, and per-
sonal interests. There is currently a multi-billion dollar market for
online advertising, which generates the primary revenue for some
of the most popular websites on the Internet.
In order to meet
the immense market demand, and to manage the complex relation-
ships between advertisers and publishers (i.e., the websites host-
ing the ads), marketplaces known as “ad exchanges” are employed.
These exchanges allow publishers (sellers of ad space) and adver-
tisers (buyers of this ad space) to dynamically broker trafﬁc through
ad networks to efﬁciently maximize proﬁts for all parties. Unfor-
tunately, the complexities of these systems invite a considerable
amount of abuse from cybercriminals, who proﬁt at the expense of
the advertisers.
In this paper, we present a detailed view of how one of the largest
ad exchanges operates and the associated security issues from the
vantage point of a member ad network. More speciﬁcally, we an-
alyzed a dataset containing transactions for ingress and egress ad
trafﬁc from this ad network. In addition, we examined informa-
tion collected from a command-and-control server used to operate
a botnet that is leveraged to perpetrate ad fraud against the same ad
exchange.

INTRODUCTION
Online advertising has developed into a massive economy and is
now the main source of revenue for some of the most popular on-
line businesses and search engines (e.g., Google and Yahoo! [5]).
In its simplest form, online advertising is a buyer/seller relationship
between those who want to show ads (advertisers, who buy space
on Web pages) and those who get paid to display ads for others for
a fee (publishers, or sellers, who own the Web pages). The process
becomes more complicated as more advertisers and publishers are
added to the system. To facilitate these endeavors, an intermediary
entity called an ad network (or ad commissioner [20]) keeps track
of the publishers and advertisers within its domain.
It is the ad
network’s job to take the publishers’ ad requests, which are gener-
ated when users load a publisher’s website, and pair them with the
advertisers willing to pay the most for the publishers’ niche mar-
ket. In turn, the network takes a percentage of all revenue that is
exchanged in transactions that it oversees. Thus, in the network
model of advertising, handling ad requests becomes a broker pro-
cess that seeks to maximize revenue for all involved parties.
Ad exchanges, such as Google’s DoubleClick or Yahoo!’s Right-
Media, operate similar to an ad network, where the entities that buy
or sell ads are ad networks. This allows one ad network to sell its
publishers’ ad space to another network or buy ad space for its ad-
vertisers, so that advertisers are able to reach a much larger audi-
ence than they could if they were part of a single ad network. Un-
like an ad network, an ad exchange is not fully connected, and net-
works in the exchange cannot buy and sell each other’s ads freely
until they have established a contractual agreement describing how
trafﬁc will be bought and sold between them. This allows the ad
exchange to handle the distribution of ads from a centralized ad
server, which has a public API allowing ad networks to conﬁgure
and monitor their accounts.
While ad exchanges provide a powerful mechanism for adver-
tisers, ad networks, and publishers to efﬁciently manage their ad
trafﬁc, they have also become a lucrative target for cybercriminals.
In particular, miscreants have developed malware that is used to
remotely control compromised computers, known as bots, and net-
work them into a single botnet. A botnet can be instructed to view
and click ads, simulating user trafﬁc. As a result, botnet operators
can generate revenue simply by creating a website, signing up as a
publisher, and directing their bots to view and click on the adver-
tisements contained on their own website.
In this paper, we collaborated with a large ad network that is a
member of Yahoo!’s RightMedia, one of the largest ad exchanges.
This enabled us to obtain a direct view of how a large real-world ad
network operates in the context of an ad exchange, and to analyze
the security threats and fraudulent activities that pose the greatest
279risks. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject, we will refer to this
ad network throughout the paper as NETWORKX. Our goal in this
project was to study and understand how an ad exchange operates
from the perspective of an individual ad network. Moreover, we
applied a number of models to the ad network’s data to explore
methods that might be able to identify suspicious click trafﬁc in
the context of an ad exchange. In addition, we obtained access to
a command-and-control (C&C) server that was used to control a
botnet that engaged in ad fraud targeted towards the RightMedia
exchange. Because of our access to the botnet C&C server, our
models were geared more towards fraud that was perpetrated by
a botnet; however, we also discuss a number of additional fraud
techniques we observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst large-scale study of fraudulent activities in online ad exchanges
from these vantage points.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce online advertising and describe how
ad exchanges operate to serve ads on the Internet. We then review
types of fraud that are known to exist in online advertising, and
we describe which techniques are used to prevent this fraud from
occurring. Finally, we describe the ad fraud botnet C&C server that
was used to perpetrate fraud on RightMedia.
2.1 Terminology
Below are deﬁnitions of the various advertising terms we use in
this paper. Note that some of the terms below are deﬁned in the
context of Yahoo!’s RightMedia. For a more general deﬁnition of
the terms, refer to the Internet Advertising Bureau’s online glos-
sary [3].
• Publishers (or Sellers) make money through the exchange by
hosting websites with advertisements. Each visitor to their sites
generates revenue for the publisher depending on the niche market
that describes their websites. In general, the more visitors publish-
ers attract to their websites the more money they earn.
• Advertisers (or Buyers) pay the ad network to have their ads dis-
played on publishers’ websites. Whenever their ads are shown,
they have to pay the ad network, and a percentage is paid to the
publisher.
• Ad Networks are entities in the exchange that manage publishers
and advertisers. They are able to buy and sell ad trafﬁc (in the
form of ad requests) internally as well as through other ad networks.
Ad networks that can buy and sell trafﬁc between each other are
called linked partners, and each ad network maintains its own list
of trusted partner networks.
• Instead of having static ads that display the same content, pub-
lishers load ads dynamically by putting sections (also called zones
or regions) on their pages. A section simply refers to a block of
space on the page that is able to make a request for an ad dynam-
ically when the page is loaded.
In practice, this is often imple-
mented by embedding an iframe that loads some JavaScript in the
page, which, in turn, detects if the browser has Adobe Flash and
whether browser cookies are enabled. This information is sent to
an ad server so that an ad can be served to the user’s browser, in a
process called an ad request.
• A creative refers to the content of the actual advertisement, which
is what the visitor sees on the page after the ad is served. The ad
normally consists of an image or an Adobe Flash animation and
an anchor tag that points to the advertiser’s website, called a click-
through.
• The auction process refers to how a section is populated by a
creative.
It involves matching up each ad request with the most
proﬁtable advertiser bid for the request. Before any ads are served,
publishers and advertisers outline a number of ad serving require-
ments such as budget, when ads should be shown, and targeting
information. These requirements are used to match requests and
bids autonomously in the exchange in a way that maximizes proﬁt
for the publisher. A single successful auction in the exchange is
called an impression.
• A click event is generated when a user clicks on an ad, and it usu-
ally brings more revenue to the publisher than an impression alone.
Clicks and impressions are handled separately in the exchange, so
a user loading a page and clicking on an ad actually generates two
events, an impression and a click. The ratio of clicks and impres-
sions is the ad’s Click Through Rate (CTR). Publishers’ CTRs are
also recorded for use in fraud detection.
• Ad campaigns are the way in which advertisers specify how much
they pay when their ads are shown. There are many different types
of campaigns, but the most common type is based on Cost per Mille
(CPM) impressions, which is simply how much one thousand im-
pressions are worth to an advertiser. In this scheme, an advertiser
pays an amount to the publisher for each ad that gets served to the
site.
• Additional ad campaign types are Cost per Click (CPC) and Cost
per Action (CPA). CPC deals pay the publisher only when a user
clicks the ad that is served; CPA deals only pay the publisher when
a user clicks the ad and continues on to perform some action on
the site (known as a conversion), usually ﬁlling in a landing page
form. Because the amount of revenue associated with CPC and
CPA deals depends on a user clicking the ad, the server estimates
how much the ad will pay by calculating the effective Cost Per Mille
(eCPM) impressions. The formula for this is: eCPM = ((Payout per
impression) + (Historical CTR) * (Payout per click) + (Historical
actions to impressions) * (Payout per action)) * 1000.
• In addition to the auction process, there is a practice called arbi-
trage that ad networks can use to increase their revenue. Arbitrage
is done by ad networks buying impressions from publishers as if
they were a real advertiser, and starting a new auction for the ad
slot as if they were a real publisher. As we will discuss later, this
has a number of implications that have to be accounted for when
analyzing the data stream from NETWORKX.
2.2 Structure of an Ad Exchange
An ad exchange is structured as a graph where each node is an ad
network, which owns its own set of unique publishers and advertis-
ers. Publishers are only able to request ads (sell trafﬁc), and adver-
tisers can only bid on requests (buy trafﬁc). However, ad networks
are able to both buy and sell trafﬁc, allowing them to act as bro-
kers between different parts of the exchange that would not be con-
nected otherwise. Thus, publishers and advertisers are edge nodes,
and ad networks form the backbone of the exchange, as shown in
Figure 1.
As previously mentioned, the exchange is not fully connected
and trafﬁc cannot be bought and sold freely across the exchange.
This is because an ad network can only interact with another ad net-
work if they are linked partners. Partnerships deﬁne an edge in the
graph; when two entities become afﬁliates they decide on the spe-
ciﬁc parameters that will deﬁne their relationship in the exchange,
which is usually a revenue share deal. For example, NETWORKX
may take 50% of all publisher revenue for a particular partner who
targets trafﬁc from users interested in German news, and 60% of
280Figure 1: An overview of an online ad exchange.
publisher revenue with another partner that targets American sports
trafﬁc.
2.3 How the Auction Process Works
In the ad network model of online ad serving, one advertising
network has access to its own advertisers and publishers, and the
network searches the list of advertisers for each ad request to de-
termine which would be the most proﬁtable for the publisher and
thus the network. The process is similar in an ad exchange, except
that the pool of advertisers also includes advertisers who are part
of the network’s linked partners (and those partners’ linked part-
ners, and so on). The process starts when a user loads a Web page
that contains a RightMedia HTML iframe or JavaScript popup that
initiates a request for an advertisement of a speciﬁc size. A unique
identiﬁer, known as a section ID, enables an ad network to track im-
pressions, clicks, and conversions from a particular publisher. Note
that the section ID is the only information that an ad network uses
to determine the publisher that should be credited. As we will dis-
cuss later, this makes verifying the legitimacy of a single ad request
very difﬁcult.
When the ad request is received by the ad exchange’s ad server,
the ad server is able to lookup which publisher the section ID be-
longs to. This ad request is then associated with the publisher’s
ad serving requirements, and it is matched with viable bids, based
on the targeting criteria of the advertisers. Each advertiser speci-
ﬁes a maximum bid, but the actual bid amount is determined au-
tomatically by the exchange based on the advertiser’s Return on
Investment (ROI) goals and the number of other advertisers who
are able to bid. The bids are always in the form of the effective
cost per mille impressions (eCPM), regardless of the types of af-
ﬁliations between intermediary ad networks. The ﬁnal amount the
bid is worth to the publisher is affected by how many intermediary
ad networks are brokering the transaction. For example, consider
a publisher and an advertiser who are part of an ad network. The
advertiser’s campaign with the network is a $1 CPM deal, while
the publisher has a 50% revenue share deal. Therefore, the adver-
tiser’s bids will only be worth $0.50 to the publisher, because the
network is taking half of the revenue. In reality, the ad exchange
would take a cut as well. When the value of all available bids has
been computed, the exchange simply picks the bid with the highest
eCPM for the publisher, and then the ad is served.
2.4 How Arbitrage Works
Arbitrage occurs after the auction process. In order to initiate
arbitrage, the network must buy the publisher’s ad trafﬁc itself and
then resell the trafﬁc in a completely new, independent auction.
This is done by serving a new ad tag to the user after the initial
auction, instead of an ad. The new ad tag contains a new section
ID that is owned by the ad network and not by an actual publisher
(note that the ad network could choose to return a non-RightMedia
ad tag as well). Whatever revenue is generated in the new auction
goes to the ad network that won the ﬁrst auction, in the hopes that
the second auction will make a proﬁt larger than the ad request cost.
Since the network must buy the trafﬁc before reselling it, unsold
arbitrage trafﬁc is a direct loss for the ad network. Arbitrage can
be repeated a number of times across different ad networks until an
actual ad is served; this process is called daisy chaining. The longer
the chain of arbitrage, the longer it takes to load the ad that is ﬁnally
displayed in the user’s browser that ﬁrst made the ad request.
2.5 Known Types of Fraud
Fraud (or Ad Fraud) in the context of an ad exchange is a means
by which a member or members in the exchange try to increase
their proﬁts at the cost of other members in the exchange. A fraud-
ster is simply a member of the exchange who is perpetrating fraud
of some kind. The fraudster may be a publisher in the exchange
who is attempting to make more money than it deserves, or an ad-
vertiser who is targeting other advertisers to reduce ad competition.
The simplest kind of fraud is called impression spam, and it in-
