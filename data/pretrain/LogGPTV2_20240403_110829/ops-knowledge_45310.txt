User: How to use a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to load balance traffic and improve application performance?
Assistant: Using a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to load balance traffic can achieve the following steps: 1. Create an NLB: In the AWS console, select NLB, select the required VPC and subnet, then specify the security group and select the IP address type ( IPv4 or IPv6). 2. Add target group: Add instances that need load balancing to the target group, and monitor data through HTTPS or HTTP protocol. 3. Configure the target group: add at least two instances to the target group to ensure high availability of load balancing, and specify the port of each instance, health check interval, response timeout and other parameters. 4. Use DNS name: Use the load balancer by resolving the DNS name to the IP address of the NLB. There are several ways to improve application performance by using a network load balancer: 1. Load balancing: NLB can be used to distribute requests to multiple instances, thereby achieving load balancing and increasing application performance and reliability. During times of high load, distributing requests across multiple instances prevents a single instance from being overutilized. 2. Monitoring application performance: NLB provides the function of real-time monitoring application performance. By monitoring the health status, number of connections, traffic and other parameters of the load balancer, performance bottlenecks can be identified and improvement measures can be implemented. 3. Auto-scaling: Using AWS Auto-Scaling Groups (ASGs), the number of instances can be automatically scaled up or down based on the traffic in the load balancer. This will ensure that during times of peak load, more instances are automatically added to the application to enhance the performance of the application. 4. Low latency: NLB can achieve very low latency, which is critical for distributed applications and high-speed interactive applications. Latency is minimized by sending client requests to the closest instance and ensuring minimal network latency between instances.
