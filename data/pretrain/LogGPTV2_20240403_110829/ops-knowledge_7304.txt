To verify the accuracy of a server's hostname, you can use the following methods:

1. **On Linux:**
   - Open a terminal and enter the `hostname` command to display the current hostname.
   - Alternatively, you can view the hostname configuration file by entering `cat /etc/hostname`.

2. **On Windows:**
   - Navigate to Control Panel > System and Security > System. Under "Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings," you will find the current hostname.

3. **Testing Hostname Reachability:**
   - Use the `ping` command followed by the hostname (e.g., `ping example-hostname`) to check if the hostname is reachable. A successful ping response indicates that the hostname is correct and the server is accessible.

4. **Web Server Verification:**
   - If your hostname is part of a URL, try accessing it through a web browser. If the URL loads successfully, this suggests that the hostname is correctly configured.

**Modifying the Hostname:**

- **On Linux:**
  - To change the hostname, edit the `/etc/hostname` file with a text editor. After making changes, run the `hostnamectl set-hostname new-hostname` command to apply the new hostname. It may also be necessary to update the `/etc/hosts` file to include the new hostname.
  
- **On Windows:**
  - To change the hostname, go to Control Panel > System and Security > System. Click on "Change settings" under "Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings." In the System Properties window, select the "Computer Name" tab and click "Change." Enter the new hostname and follow the prompts to complete the process. Remember to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

By following these steps, you should be able to both check and modify the hostname of your server as needed.
