Table 1 summarizes our hardware selection. We opted
for an equal distribution of LCDs and Plasmas — the two
dominant technologies currently on the market. Furthermore
we deliberately selected three pairs of duplicate TV models
to enable analysis of EMI signature similarity across identical
hardware. This table also introduces a naming scheme which
we use in the remainder of the paper. Under this convention,
television names include manufacturer, size, and model-pair
information. For example the name Samsung-32 indicates

Next we needed to choose what video signals to send to the

tion systematic, we chose four top-rated ﬁlms within each of
ﬁve distinct genres (ratings were extracted from the Internet
movie database, imdb.com). Since these movies had variable
running times, we limited our analysis to the ﬁrst 60 minutes
of each DVD video stream. Table 2 lists the movies that
constitute our library. Looking ahead, our results suggest
that our methodology is applicable far beyond a collection
of 20 target movies. Nevertheless, we note that past work
on video information leakage also studied a similarly-sized
collection of movies (26 movies), though in a very diﬀerent
context (information leakage from streaming encrypted video
data) [25]. Returning to the threat model in Section 4, we
also argue that distinguishing between 20 movies approxi-
mates the adversarial goal of target channel identiﬁcation.
In our experiments we also embed random portions of these
20 movies into streaming TV signals and assess our ability
to detect the embedded videos, thereby approximating the
adversarial goal of target video identiﬁcation.
7. DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE
We performed recordings on each of our 8 TVs in a lab
environment where we could carefully regulate the electrical
conditions. This data accounted for 13 days of EMI traces,
and provided the foundation of most of our analysis. Next,
we selected a single TV (Panasonic-42-B) and deployed our
system to three home locations to gather data in electrically
uncontrolled settings. Lastly, we recorded EMI from 20
hours of broadcast programming, which was the basis of the
experiment described in Section 9.5.
Lab Recording.
During lab recordings, we plugged a
given TV and our voltage sensor into an isolation transformer
to remove interference from other electrical devices in the
3
building. We then streamed our database of 20 movies twice
while logging EMI in the 6 to 250 kHz range.
Home Recording. To evaluate EMI based information
leakage under a more naturalistic setting, we also performed
data collection in three homes with distinct sizes, neigh-
borhoods, ages (1906, 2003, 2009), and styles (apartment,
suburban house, multi-family home) on a subset of our movie
database (12 movies, 15 minutes each). Table 3 shows the

Two runs of our movie library were recorded on each TV to
investigate the repeatability of EMI signatures.

speciﬁcations for these residences. During the home data
collection, we did not prevent occupants from actuating elec-
trical devices and we also did not use the isolation trans-
former. Also, we plugged in our sensor in a arbitrarily chosen
electrical outlet that was available. Thus, we captured not
only the EMI from the TV but also any number of active
electrical devices operating in the home under natural con-
ditions (e.g., lamps, kitchen appliances, computers, other
televisions). Many times during our home data collection
EMI from other devices overlapped with the EMI from the
TV under investigation. In addition, Home#2 used power
line communication (PLC) during recordings, however we did
not observe signiﬁcant signal interference since home PLC
signals are typically narrow-band in our recording range.
8. SIGNAL CONDITIONING
Automated Signal Identiﬁcation. To facilitate analy-
sis we needed to devise a method for extracting meaningful
signals from the FFT data captured using our hardware. Re-
calling the properties of EMI we described in Section 2, we see
that there are two critical questions which must be answered
in order to track the signature of a particular device: (1) in
what range of the frequency spectrum does the EMI signal
reside, and (2) in what way does the EMI signal ﬂuctuate
with changes in device state.
Although it is often possible to answer both of these ques-
tions by visual inspection of a spectrum analyzer during
device operation, we sought to develop a systematic search
procedure which played a 5 minute custom software-generated
video while performing a range sweep to ﬁnd EMI changes
that are strongly correlated in time with the controlled sig-
nal. The search method was designed to determine the EMI
frequency range, ﬂuctuation type (frequency or energy den-
sity), and to ultimately produce a 1-dimensional time series
representation (EMI trace) normalized to the 0:1 domain.
The search algorithm requires FFT samples extracted from
EMI over the 0 to 250 kHz frequency range collected during
controlled video signal playback (36600 total FFT samples).
Given this input our procedure analyzes subsets (windows)
of the frequency spectrum and correlates their EMI trace
(computed as both energy density and frequency shift) to the
trace of brightness changes in the software-generated video
4
. At the end of the sweep, the optimal 1-dimensional EMI
trace is returned which produced maximal correlations to the
control signal (the search is performed across all frequency
windows and signal types). The functions we applied are
shown below in pseudo-code using the array syntax initial-
value:ﬁnal-value common to the MATLAB programming
language. Smoothing is done using a 4th order Butterworth
ﬁlter with a cutoﬀ frequency of 10 kHz; decimation is done
using eighth-order lowpass Chebyshev Type I ﬁlter with

Our experiments led us to conclude that artiﬁcially gener-
ated color gradients work well as control signals.

a cutoﬀ frequency of 0.8 ∗ (F s/2)/r where r = 20 is the
decimation factor; standard normalization is performed to
shift the domain to 0:1.
Using the EMI search procedure, we were able to charac-
terize the EMI signatures for all of the TVs in the lab setting
(Table 4). In addition, the search method proved invaluable
when we analyzed EMI from home recordings as diﬀerent
residences had unique levels of dynamic background noise
which overlapped with tracking ranges we found in lab; our
methods were always able to ﬁnd frequency regions minimally
inﬂuenced by the other powerline noise and thus enabled us
to recover the TV EMI signal (due to harmonics).

9. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
We began by experimentally establishing that individual
televisions produce repeatable EMI traces when the same
video content is shown multiple times. Building on this
result, we show that the EMI signals produced by multiple
TVs of the same model are highly correlated given identical
video inputs. We then use our collection of 20 movies to
study the ability of an attacker to match the EMI collected
from one movie with a database of previously collected EMI
measurements from all 20 movies. Together, these results
suggest that an attacker can use TV EMI to accomplish the
target channel identiﬁcation goal from Section 4 with high
conﬁdence. Next, we study the feasibility of our approach in
three home environments, where additional signals sources
are active on the power line. The data from homes also allows
us to reason about the possibility of matching EMI traces
gathered in an electrically clean setting to those collected

depth later, are the Sharp 32
TVs. Conversely, dissimilar
video content tended to produce highly uncorrelated EMI
traces. The latter conclusion was drawn from the results of
our followup experiment which analyzed the potential for
similarity between EMI traces from diﬀerent video streams.
More speciﬁcally, we recorded the highest levels of cross-
correlation possible while matching a movie against all other
ﬁlms in the database (itself excluded); our measurements are
reported in the right column of Table 5.
Model Families. While the above ﬁndings indicate signif-
icant information leakage within a TV, it’s not clear whether
this leakage poses a signiﬁcant threat to privacy. The ques-
tion arises: can an attacker infer information from the EMI
of a TV that he or she is not able to physically access? We
explore that question here by assessing how similar the EMI
is between two TVs of the same model. We performed this
test by replicating the methods above, but instead of com-
paring EMI signals from multiple recording sessions on a
single TV we analyzed the correlations between EMI signals
between single sessions of EMI recorded on TVs within the
same model family (i.e., Panasonic-42-A vs Panasonic-42-B,
Samsung-58-A vs Samsung-58-B, and Sharp-32-A vs Sharp-
32-B). As before, we computed the EMI similarity of identical
content (Table 6, left column) as well as distinct content (each
movie against all others, Table 6, right column).
The experiments suggested that, with few

exceptions, EMI from identical video signals are highly re-
peatable while distinct video sources yield independent EMI
signals. These results were shown to hold within individual
TVs as well as across pairs of TVs within a model family. In
both cases, the Sharp 32
TVs produced outlier data points,
reﬂecting a signiﬁcant decrease in EMI consistency relative
to the averages of other TVs. We attribute this to the fact
that these devices had the least dynamic EMI (minimally
modulated by screen content changes) within the televisions

we tested. We tested the power consumption of the Sharp 32
TVs and found that their power draw changed by only 1W
(175W to 176W) when playing a software generated custom
video, whereas the Sharp 42
TV exhibited a 24W (190W
to 214W) change using the same video signal. Thus we at-
tribute the small dynamic shifts in EMI of the Sharp 32
to

from noisy environments (i.e., matches are possible between
lab and home EMI). Finally, we showcase the robustness of
our methods by accurately identifying segments of EMI from
our movie database that have been embedded within a stream
of foreign EMI (20 hours of local television broadcasting),
thus providing strong evidence that an attacker can also use
TV EMI to accomplish the target video identiﬁcation goal
from Section 4 with high conﬁdence.
9.1 Signal Repeatability in Lab
Individual TVs.
The ﬁrst question we sought to answer
was whether repeated video content played on a target TV
would produce consistent EMI. To test this, we computed
the cross-correlation of a movie’s EMI trace between multiple
recording sessions. The left column of Table 5 contains the
cross-correlation statistics when this computation was applied
to every movie in our database and repeated for each TV,
using only the ﬁrst 15 minutes of each trace. These levels
of high cross-correlation suggest that for most televisions
multiple runs of identical video content produced consistently
