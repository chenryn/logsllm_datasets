### 5.1 Inter-Session Characteristics

The analysis of inter-session characteristics follows the same methods used in Section 4 for the analysis of request-level workload.

#### 5.1.1 Number of Sessions Initiated per Unit of Time

The Hurst exponent values for the raw data of sessions initiated per second are presented in Figure 9, with web servers sorted by the total number of sessions initiated within a week in descending order. We test the stationarity of the session-based time series using the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test [17]. The results indicate that the WVU, ClarkNet, and CSEE web servers exhibit a slight trend and a 24-hour periodicity, while the NASA-Pub2 session-based time series is stationary. Similar to the request-based time series, removing the trend and periodicity leads to smaller values of the autocorrelation function.

A more formal analysis of the long-range dependence of the stationary session-based time series, based on the estimates of the Hurst exponent presented in Figure 10, yields the following conclusions:
1. The Hurst exponent values based on the raw data are generally higher than those based on the stationary time series.
2. The Hurst exponent values for all web servers are greater than 0.5, indicating that the session arrival process on a second time scale exhibits long-range dependence.
3. The long-range dependence of the sessions initiated per second time series appears to be less influenced by the workload intensity compared to the request-based time series.
4. The Hurst estimators provide consistent estimates, which is not always the case [13].
5. The Abry-Veitch method provides slightly higher values of H than the Whittle method, consistent with the results in [13].

We also study the estimates \(\hat{H}(m)\) of the Hurst exponent obtained from the aggregated series \(X(m)\) for increasing levels of aggregation \(m\). The values of \(\hat{H}(m)\) for all datasets are quite stable and fluctuate only slightly. The 95% confidence interval bands also remain stable, providing statistical evidence for the long-range dependence of the session arrival process.

### 5.2 Intra-Session Characteristics

In this section, we analyze the session length, the number of requests per session, and the number of bytes transferred per session. We use the statistical methods described in Section 3.2 to examine whether these intra-session characteristics can be modeled with heavy-tailed distributions.

#### 5.2.1 Session Length in Time Units

The first intra-session characteristic is the session length in units of time. The log-log complementary distribution (LLCD) plot of the session length for the WVU server, covering all 10,287 sessions during the High four-hour interval, is shown in Figure 11. For sessions longer than about 1,000 seconds, the plot is nearly linear, indicating a hyperbolic upper tail. The least squares regression estimate of the heavy-tail index is \(\alpha_{LLCD} = 1.67\) with a standard error of \(\sigma_\alpha = 0.004\). The coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) is 0.993, indicating a very good fit between the empirical and mathematical distributions.

To further confirm that the session length of the WVU server can be described by a Pareto distribution with finite mean and infinite variance, we estimate the tail index \(\alpha_{Hill}\) using the Hill plot. The value of the Hill estimator for varying \(k\) restricted to the upper 14% tail is shown in Figure 12. The Hill estimator stabilizes at approximately \(\alpha_{Hill} \approx 1.58\), consistent with the estimate obtained by the LLCD method.

Table 2 summarizes the values of \(\alpha_{Hill}\) estimated using the Hill estimator and \(\alpha_{LLCD}\) and \(R^2\) estimated using the LLCD plot for each Low, Med, and High four-hour interval and one-week period for each web server. In most cases, the Hill estimator provides estimates of the tail index \(\alpha\) close to those obtained using the LLCD method. However, in a few cases, the Hill plots did not stabilize, which is annotated as NS in Table 2. For the NASA-Pub2 server, which has low workload intensity, the number of sessions in the Low four-hour interval was insufficient to estimate \(\alpha\) with either method (annotated as NA).

**Figure 11.** LLCD plot for WVU session length, High

The results for one week show that the session length is reasonably well-modeled by a Pareto distribution with \(1.723 \leq \alpha_{LLCD} \leq 2.329\). The session length for the WVU and ClarkNet servers is heavy-tailed (with finite mean and infinite variance) for lengths longer than 21 minutes. It can also be observed that the session length for these two servers is heavy-tailed. However, there are intervals (i.e., Med for CSEE and Med and High for NASA-Pub2) where the session length is consistent with heavy-tailed distributions.

Since some researchers advocate the use of lognormal distributions, we incorporate an additional test in our analysis. It is known that when the variance is large, a lognormal CCDF appears long-tailed in a log-log plot, at least to a point [9], [10]. The curvature test proposed in [9] was applied to all datasets. The p-values for both the Pareto and lognormal models for all intervals shown in Table 2 are greater than 0.05, indicating that with 95% confidence, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the sample comes from either distribution. According to the curvature test, for some intervals, the lognormal distribution is a better fit than the Pareto distribution. However, different estimates of \(\alpha\) and different random samples led to different p-values, suggesting that the curvature test is sensitive to the estimated value of \(\alpha\) and the random sample. This sensitivity and the difficulty in distinguishing between Pareto and lognormal distributions may be due to the small number of sample observations in the extreme tail, leading to a large overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the two distributions [10].

#### 5.2.2 Number of Requests per Session

Another intra-session characteristic is the number of requests per session. The results of the curvature test [9] for the number of requests per session were similar to those for the session length in time: neither the Pareto nor the lognormal model could be rejected for any interval. For example, the LLCD plot of the session length in the number of requests for one week of data for the ClarkNet server (Figure 13) shows an increasing slope in the extreme tail, but the Pareto distribution provides a better fit than the lognormal distribution.

As shown in Table 3, the tail index of the Pareto model for the distribution of session length in the number of requests for one week of data ranges from \(1.615 \leq \alpha_{LLCD} \leq 2.586\). Under the Pareto model, the session length in the number of requests shows clear heavy-tailed behavior with a tail index \(\alpha\) significantly smaller than 2 only for the NASA-Pub2 server. For this server, over 84% of requests belong to sessions in the 75th percentile tail. The other three servers have a tail index around 2, indicating that the session length in the number of requests is on the borderline between finite and infinite variance. It should be emphasized that many long sessions in time units do not have many requests, meaning that the sessions in the tail of the session length distribution are different from those in the tail of the number of requests per session distribution.

#### 5.2.3 Bytes Transferred per Session

For the last intra-session characteristic, the total number of bytes transferred per session, we count the bytes transferred for both completed and partial transfers. Based on the curvature test [9], neither the Pareto nor the lognormal distribution can be rejected as models for the bytes transferred per session. As in the other cases, the p-value for the Pareto distribution was sensitive to the estimated value of \(\alpha\) and the generated random sample.

If the Pareto distribution is used to model the bytes transferred per session, as shown in Table 4, the range for \(\alpha_{LLCD}\) for one week of data is \(0.954 \leq \alpha_{LLCD} \leq 1.842\). This means that all web servers have heavy tails (with infinite variance) for the number of bytes transferred per session.

### Conclusion

This rigorous statistical analysis highlights the importance of accurate modeling of web session characteristics. For example, the simulation of session-based admission control for peak load management in [5], [6] assumed an exponential distribution for session length, which our results show is incorrect. Accurate modeling is crucial for effective resource management and system design in web environments.
