The analysis of inter–session characteristics is based on the
same methods used in section 4 for analysis of request level work-
load.
5.1.1 Number of sessions initiated per unit of time
The values of the Hurst exponent for the raw data of the ses-
sions initiated per second times series are presented in Figure 9
with Web servers sorted by the total number of sessions initiated
within a week in descending order. As in case of the request–
based time series, we test whether the session–based time series
is stationarity using the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test
[17]. The results show that WVU, ClarkNet, and CSEE Web
servers have a slight trend and 24 hour period. The NASA-Pub2
session–based time series is stationary. Similarly to the request–
based time series, removing the trend and periodicity leads to
smaller values of the autocorrelation function.
The more formal analysis of the long–range dependence of
the stationary session–based time series, based on the estimates
of the Hurst exponent presented in Figure 10, leads to the fol-
lowing conclusions: (1) The values of the Hurst exponent based
on the raw data are higher than the values based on the station-
ary time series in most of the cases. (2) The values of the Hurst
exponent for all Web servers are higher than 0.5. These results
indicate that the session arrival process on a second time scale
is long–range dependant. (3) The long–range dependence of the
sessions initiated per second times series seems to be less inﬂu-
enced by the workload intensity than the request–based time se-
ries. (4) The Hurst estimators provide consistent estimates, which
is not necessarily always the case [13]. (5) Abry-Veitch method
provides slightly higher value of H than Whittle method, which
is consistent with the results presented in [13].
Again, as with request arrival process, we study the estimates
ˆH (m) of the Hurst exponent obtained from the aggregated series
X (m) for increasing level of aggregation m. The values of ˆH (m)
for all datasets are quite stable and ﬂuctuate slightly. The same
holds for the 95% conﬁdence interval bands, indicating a statis-

5.2.1 Session length in time units
The ﬁrst intra–session characteristic is the sessions length in units
of time. The LLCD plot of the session length of WVU server for
all 10,287 sessions that occurred during the High four hour in-
terval is presented in Figure 11. For sessions longer than about
1000 seconds, the plot is nearly linear, which indicates a hyper-
bolic upper tail. The least square regression estimate of the heavy
tail index is αLLCD = 1.67 with standard error σα = 0.004. The
coefﬁcient of determination (R2) is 0.993, which indicates a very
good ﬁt between the empirical and mathematical distribution.
To further conﬁrm the observation that session length of
WVU server can be described with Pareto distribution with ﬁ-
nite mean and inﬁnite variance, we also estimate the tail index
αHill using the Hill plot. The value of Hill estimator for varying
k restricted to the upper 14% tail is shown in Figure 12. The
Hill estimator seems to settle to a relatively constant estimate
αHill ≈ 1.58 which is consistent with the estimate obtained by
the LLCD method.
Table 2 summarizes the values of αHill estimated using the
Hill estimate, and αLLCD and R2 estimated using LLCD plot for
each Low, Med, and High four hour interval and one week period
for each Web server. As it can be seen, in most cases Hill esti-
mator provides estimates of the tail index α close to the estimates
obtained using the LLCD method. However, in a few cases Hill
plots did not stabilize, which is annotated with NS in Table 2. For
NASA-Pub2 server, which has low workload intensity, the num-
ber of sessions in the Low four hour interval were not sufﬁcient
to estimate α with either method (annotated with NA).
Figure 11. LLCD plot for WVU session length, High
The results for one week show that the session length is rea-
sonably well modelled by a Pareto distribution with 1.723 ≤
αLLCD ≤ 2.329. The session length of WVU and ClarkNet
servers is heavy–tailed (with ﬁnite mean and inﬁnite variance)
for lengths longer than 21 minutes in both cases. It also can be
observed that the session length for these two servers is heavy-
tailed (1  2). However,
there are intervals (i.e., Med for CSEE and Med and High for
NASA-Pub2) which have session length consistent with heavy–
tailed distributions.
Since there is a group of researchers who advocate lognormal

tical evidence for a long–range dependence of the session arrival
process.
5.1.2 Testing for Poisson arrivals at session level
Next, we test whether the time series of sessions initiated per
second can be modelled with Poisson process, using the same
methods as in section 4.2.
It should be noted that for NASA-
Pub2 server the number of sessions in Low, Med, and High four
hour intervals are not sufﬁcient to conduct the test. The results
of the statistical tests for four hour intervals divided into four 1-
hour intervals show that only in CSEE Low and Med intervals
session arrivals are indistinguishable from the Poisson process.
Thus, unlike TELNET connection arrivals and FTP session ar-
rivals which were well modelled as Poisson process with ﬁxed
hourly rates [22], Web session arrivals are Poisson only when the
workload is low (less than 1,000 sessions in a four hour period
for our datasets). As in the case of the request arrival process,
the assumption made about the distribution of sessions initiated
within a second (i.e., uniform and deterministic) does not affect
the results.
5.2
Intra–session characteristics
In this section we analyze the session length, number of re-
quest per session, and number of bytes transferred per session. In
particular, we use the statistical methods described in section 3.2
to examine whether intra–session characteristics can be modelled
with heavy–tailed distributions.

The following example illustrates the importance of rigorous
statistical analysis and the implications of our results. The simu-
lation of the session–based admission control used for peak load
management presented in [5], [6] was based on the assumption
that the session length is exponentially distributed, which as our
results show is an incorrect assumption.
5.2.2 Number of requests per session
Another intra–session characteristics is the number of requests
per session (i.e., session length in number of requests). The re-
sults of the curvature test [9] for the number of request per session
were similar as for the session length in time - neither Paerto nor
lognormal models can be rejected for any interval. For example,
note that although the LLCD plot of the session length in num-
ber of request for one week of data for ClarkNet server presented
in Figure 13 shows increasing slope in the extreme tail, Pareto
distribution provides better ﬁt than the lognormal distribution.
As it can be seen from Table 3, the tail index of Pareto model
for the distribution of session length in number of requests for one
week of data is in the range 1.615 ≤ αLLCD ≤ 2.586. Under the
Pareto model, the session length in number of request shows clear
heavy–tailed behavior with tail index α signiﬁcantly smaller than
2 only for NASA-Pub2 server. For this server over 84% of re-
quests belong to sessions in the 75 percentile tail. The other three
servers have tail index around 2, that is, have session length in
number of requests on the boarder line between ﬁnite and inﬁnite
variance. It should be emphasized that for all servers many long
sessions in time units do not have many requests. That is, many
sessions in the tail of session length distribution are completely
different from the sessions in the tail of the number of request per
session distribution.
The session length in number of requests is the only intra–
session characteristic studied earlier. In [21], based on the LLCD
plot, it was suggested that the tail of the distribution for the auc-
tion site falls abruptly, while for the bookstore site it remains
close to the straight line plot of a Pareto-like distribution with
α = 1. However, the value of the tail parameter was not esti-
mated and no evidence was presented that the Pareto model ﬁts
the data. Another important observation is that in cases when the
session length in number of request is modelled with distributions
with large variance, it does not make sense to derive and report
metrics such as average session length in number of requests, as
it was done in [19], [20].
5.2.3 Bytes transferred per session
For our last intra–session characteristic, total number of bytes
transferred per session, we count the bytes transferred for both
completed and partial transfers. Similarly to the other two intra–
session characteristics, based on the curvature test [9], neither
Pareto nor lognormal distribution can be rejected as models for
the bytes transferred per session. Again, as in the other cases,
the p–value for Pareto distribution was sensitive to the estimated
value of α and generated random sample.
If the Pareto distribution is used for modelling the bytes trans-
ferred per session, as it can be seen from Table 4, 0.954 ≤
αLLCD ≤ 1.842 for one week of data. This means that all Web
servers have heavy–tails (with inﬁnite variance) for the number of

Table 2. αHill, αLLCD, and R2 for session length
rather than Pareto distribution as correct description of the data
(see for example [9]), we incorporate one more test in our analy-
sis. Thus, it is known that when the variance is large, a lognormal
CCDF is very close to a straight line in the log-log plot, that is, it
appears long–tailed, at least to a point [9], [10]. The dramatic dif-
ference between lognormal and Pareto distributions lies in the ex-
treme tail of their CCDFs. In a LLCD plot, the CCDF of a Pareto
distribution decays with constant slope, while the CCDF of a log-
normal distribution shows increasing slope in the extreme tail. To
explore how good Pareto and lognormal models match our em-
pirical data we applied the curvature test proposed in [9] on all
datasets. The p-value both under Pareto and lognormal models for
all intervals shown in Table 2 is greater than 0.05, which means
that with 95% conﬁdence we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
sample comes from Pareto or lognormal distributions. Accord-
ing to the curvature test, for some intervals lognormal is better ﬁt
than Pareto distribution. Although in [9] the author claimed that
the curvature test is insensitive to the estimated value of the pa-
rameter α, on our datasets different estimates of α led to different
p–values for Pareto distribution. Furthermore, the same estimates
for the tail index α with different random samples from Pareto
distribution used as a part of the test, yielded different p–values.
We believe that the reason for the sensitivity of the curvature test
to the estimated value of α and the random sample, as well as the
difﬁculty to distinguish Pareto and lognormal distributions, is the
fact that very often there are very few sample observations in the
extreme tail. In that case, as shown in [10], the 95% conﬁdence
intervals of Pareto and lognormal distributions have a large over-
lap at the extreme tail, which makes it hard to distinguish them.
