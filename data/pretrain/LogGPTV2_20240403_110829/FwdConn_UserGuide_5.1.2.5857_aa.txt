## Chapter 1: Overview and Installation

This chapter provides information for installing an ArcSight Forwarding Connector for event collection from an ArcSight Manager installation. The following topics are discussed:
- Product Overview
- What’s New
- The ArcSight Source Manager
- Standard Installation Procedures
- Uninstalling a Connector
- Upgrading a Connector
- Rolling Back a Connector

### Product Overview
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector allows you to receive events from a source Manager installation and send them to a secondary destination Manager, a non-ESM location, or an ArcSight Logger.

### What’s New
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector now supports compatibility with HP Operations Manager (HP OM), providing event and performance management of enterprise systems, applications, and services. For details on using this destination, see "Configuration for HP Operations Manager" on page 29.

**Note:** The HP OM destination is not FIPS compatible.

### The ArcSight Source Manager
The Source Manager is the installation from which events originate on a network using the ArcSight Forwarding Connector. The Forwarding Connector sends (or "forwards") events to a destination Manager, a non-ESM location, or a Logger appliance. The Source Manager must be of the same version as the Destination Manager.

With data originating from an ArcSight Source Manager, the ArcSight Forwarding Connector provides various destination options for forwarding events, including:
- An ArcSight destination Manager
- ArcSight Logger
- NSP Device Poll Listener
- CEF Syslog
- A CSV file
- McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator v4.0 or v4.5
- HP Operations Manager

### Sending Events to an ArcSight Destination Manager
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector logs into the source Manager and then forwards events to a destination Manager. For detailed configuration instructions, see "Forwarding Events to an ArcSight Manager" on page 15. The Destination Manager must be of the same version as the Source Manager.

### Sending Events to ArcSight Logger
ArcSight Logger is a hardware storage solution optimized for extremely high event throughput. A typical use for Logger is to collect firewall data and then forward a subset of that data to an ArcSight Manager for real-time monitoring and correlation. ArcSight Logger now supports the Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2). See "Using Logger in FIPS Mode" on page 43 for details.

**SmartMessage** is an ArcSight technology that provides a secure channel between ArcSight SmartConnectors and Logger. SmartMessage provides an end-to-end encrypted secure channel. One end is an ArcSight SmartConnector that receives events from the many devices supported by ArcSight SmartConnectors, and the other is a SmartMessage Receiver housed on the Logger appliance.

Before configuring the Forwarding Connector that sends events to the Receiver, you need to create a Receiver of type SmartMessage. After creating this Receiver, you can configure the SmartConnector to send events to Logger.

For information on configuring a Forwarding Connector to forward events to Logger, see "Forwarding Events to ArcSight Logger" on page 19.

Refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator's Guide for complete instructions about:
- Receivers
- Configuring a SmartConnector to Send Events to Logger
- Configuring SmartConnectors to Send Events to Both Logger and a Manager
- Sending Events from ArcSight ESM to Logger
- Using Logger in FIPS mode

### Sending Events to a Non-ESM Location
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector logs into the source Manager and then forwards events to a non-ESM location.

When configuring the Forwarding Connector to send events to a non-ESM destination, you might encounter a problem with certificate validation during connector setup. Ensure that the demo CA is added to the client trust store to validate the Manager's demo certificate.

To add the demo CA to the client trust store:
1. Install the connector as usual, but stop at the screen that prompts you to select a destination type.
2. After the screen prompting you to select the destination type is displayed, run the following command from the `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\bin` directory:
   ```sh
   arcsight connector tempca -ac
   ```
3. Return to the wizard and complete the installation.

For detailed configuration instructions on forwarding events to NSP, see "Forwarding Events to NSP Device Poll Listener" on page 20.

For detailed configuration instructions on forwarding CEF Syslog events, see "Forwarding CEF Syslog Events" on page 21.

For detailed configuration instructions on forwarding events to a .csv file, see "Forwarding Events to a CSV File" on page 22.

For detailed configuration instructions on forwarding events to McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO), see "Forwarding Events to McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator" on page 23.

Use of ePO requires the installation of MSSQL Server 2005 for the JDBC driver. For instructions on downloading, see "Installing the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Driver for JDBC" on page 24.

For detailed configuration instructions on forwarding events to HP Operations Manager (HP OM), see "Configuration for HP Operations Manager" on page 29.

### Standard Installation Procedures
This section describes the standard installation procedures for the ArcSight Forwarding Connector.

#### Installing ArcSight ESM
Before you install the ArcSight Forwarding Connector, ensure that ArcSight ESM has already been installed correctly. Review the ArcSight Installation and Configuration Guide before attempting a new ArcSight Forwarding Connector installation.

To ensure a successful ArcSight ESM installation:
1. Make sure that the ArcSight Manager, Database, and Console are installed correctly.
2. Run the ArcSight Manager; the ArcSight Manager command prompt window or terminal box displays a "Ready" message when the Manager has started successfully.
3. You can also monitor the `server.std.log` file located in `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\logs`.
4. Run the ArcSight Console. Although not necessary, it is helpful to have the ArcSight Console running when installing the SmartConnector to verify successful installation.

Before you install the SmartConnector, make sure you have the following available:
- Local access to the machine where the SmartConnector is to be installed
- Administrator passwords

#### Assigning Privileges on the Source Manager
Before installing the ArcSight Forwarding Connector, you need to create a Forwarding Connector account on the source Manager. After doing this, you can assign filters for incoming events.

To assign privileges in the Manager:
1. Run the ArcSight Console on the ArcSight Source Manager.
2. From the Navigator Resources tab, choose Users from the drop-down menu.
3. Create a user group under the Custom User Group.
4. Under the group created in step 3, create a user account of user type Forwarding Connector.
5. Returning to the Navigator Resources tab, right-click your chosen user group.
6. From the resulting menu, choose Edit Access Control.
7. From the Inspect/Edit window, click the Events tab under the new user type and assign the proper filters.

For detailed instructions on assigning filters and other ArcSight Console functions, refer to the Administrator's Guide for your ESM version.

### Forwarding Correlation Events
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector can forward events based upon the ACL assigned to the User Group on the source Manager. The connector can be configured to allow forwarding of ArcSight correlation events from the source Manager to the target (or destination) Manager. The ACL can also be configured to allow for viewing of the detailed chain of the forwarded correlation event, including the original correlated event.

HP OM users commonly require only correlated events to be pulled from ESM. In such cases, HP OM users can specify the selection of correlated events. To allow for only correlated events and restrict the pulling of base events, configure ESM to pull correlated events, then allow the forwarding of correlated events, as described below. These steps should be performed in sequence, then restart the source Manager.

#### Configuring to Pull Correlated Events
To configure the source Manager to send both correlation events and on-demand correlated events to the destination Manager, the ACL must contain two separate filters:
- **Filter 1**: Provided with the latest version of ArcSight ESM:
  - `/All Filters/ArcSight System/Event Types/ArcSight Correlation Events`
- **Filter 2**: Create Filter 2 containing the following conditions:
  - Event Annotation Flags ContainsBits correlated

Both filters need to be applied to the Event Permissions of the User Group ACL to be able to extract correlated events from the correlation events that are forwarded to the target Manager. Correlated events pulled on-demand are for viewing only. They are not persisted in the destination Manager.

#### Configuring to Allow Forwarding of Correlated Events
The Forwarding Connector can also be configured to automatically pull and forward correlated events irrespective of the User Group ACL. Only one forwarding connector per Manager can be configured to work in this mode. This configuration can aid in hierarchical deployment scenarios in which you need to automatically forward correlated events for further correlation and reporting on the destination Manager.

The source Manager keeps track of the events that have been previously forwarded by using the "Forwarded" annotation, disallowing duplicates.

To configure the source Manager to send both correlation events and correlated events automatically, you must specify the container ID. The container ID consists of two elements, the `entityid` and the `userid`. To begin the configuration, you must locate these two elements and combine them within the `server.properties` file.

1. To find the `entityID`, go to `$AGENT_HOME/user/agent/agent.properties` and search for `agents[0].entityid`. Copy the text string starting in `3w` to a word or note program.
   ```properties
   agents[0].entityid=3w+05uiYBABCCLKvzx0stdQ\==
   ```

2. To find the `userid`, go to the Console of the source Manager:
   - From the Navigator panel, choose the Resource tab.
   - Under Resources, choose Users to find your Forwarding Connector user.
   - Locate the Resource ID and copy the text string from the second column.

Within `$AGENT_HOME/config/server.properties` on the source Manager, add the `entityid` and `userid` to the `eventstream.cfc` property, as shown below:
```properties
eventstream.cfc=EntityID.UserID
```

3. Restart the source Manager and, if still running, the Forwarding Connector.

### Increasing the FileStore Size (Enhanced version only)
Installation of the ArcSight Forwarding Connector (Enhanced) option provides fault-tolerance, enabling events to be saved in the event of a failure. The capacity of events that can be stored during a system failure is dependent on the amount of disk space the FileStore can use on the source Manager. Although the default size of 1024 MB (1 GB) is suitable for most installations, you can increase the size of your FileStore.

To increase the size of the FileStore:
1. Open the properties file `server.defaults.properties`, located under `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\config`. The file displays the current default:
   ```properties
   filestore.disksize.max.megabytes.int=1024
   ```

2. Use this formula to determine appropriate rates for minutes of storage on your system:
   ```plaintext
   MinutesOfStorage = (((#MB / 1024) * 21,474,833) / EPS) / 60
   ```

   Given the most typical event sizes, a FileStore of 1 GB can store approximately 21,474,833 events, and at a rate of 5000 events per second, the default size provides approximately 71 minutes of storage.

When the FileStore fills up, the oldest events are purged to make room for recent ones.
