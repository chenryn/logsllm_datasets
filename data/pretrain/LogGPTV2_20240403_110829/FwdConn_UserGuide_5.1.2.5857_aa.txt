1 Overview and Installation
The ArcSight Source Manager 
The Source Manager is the installation from which events originate on a network using the ArcSight Forwarding Connector. The Forwarding Connector sends on (or “forwards”) eventsto a destination Manager, a non-ESM location or a Logger appliance.
 The Source Manager must be of the same version as the Destination Manager.
With data originating from an ArcSight Source Manager, the ArcSight Forwarding Connector provides various destination options for forwarding events, including:
	An ArcSight destination Manager
	ArcSight Logger
	NSP Device Poll Listener
	CEF Syslog	NSP Device Poll Listener
	CEF Syslog
	A CSV file
	McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator v4.0 or v4.5
	HP Operations Manager
Sending Events to an ArcSight Destination Manager 
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector logs into the source Manager and then forwards events to a destination Manager. For detailed configuration instructions, see “Forwarding Events to an ArcSight Manager” on page 15.The Destination Manager must be of the same version as the ource Manager.
Sending Events to ArcSight Logger
ArcSight Logger is a hardware storage solution optimized for extremely high event throughput. A typical use for Logger is to collect firewall data and then forward a subset of that data to an ArcSight Manager for realtime monitoring and correlation. Arcsight Logger now supports the Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2). See “Using Logger in FIPS Mode” on page 43 for details.SmartMessage is an ArcSight technology that provides a secure channel between ArcSight SmartConnectors and Logger. SmartMessage provides an end-to-end encrypted secure channel. One end is an ArcSight SmartConnector that receives events from the many devices supported by ArcSight SmartConnectors, and the other is a SmartMessage Receiver housed on the Logger appliance.Before configuring the Forwarding Connector that sends events to the Receiver, you need to create a Receiver of type SmartMessage. After you create this Receiver, you can configure the SmartConnector to send events to Logger.
For information on configuring a Forwarding Connector to forward events to Logger, see “Forwarding Events to ArcSight Logger” on page 19.6 SmartConnector™ Configuration Guide for ArcSight Forwarding Connector ArcSight Confidential
1 Overview and Installation
Refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator's Guide for complete instructions about:
	Receivers
	Configuring a SmartConnector to Send Events to Logger
	Configuring SmartConnectors to Send Events to Both Logger and a Manager
	Sending Events from ArcSight ESM to Logger	Using Logger in FIPS mode
Sending Events to a Non-ESM Location
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector logs into the source Manager and then forwards events to a non-ESM location. 
When configuring the Forwarding Connector to send events to a non-ESM destination, you might encounter a problem with certificate validation during connector setup. Make sure that the demo CA is added to the client trust store to validate the Manager's demo certificate.To make sure the demo CA is added to the client trust store:

ArcSight Confidential SmartConnector™ Configuration Guide for ArcSight Forwarding Connector 71 Overview and Installation
Installing ArcSight ESM 
Before you install the ArcSight Forwarding Connector, make sure that ArcSight ESM has already been installed correctly. Review the ArcSight Installation and Configuration Guide before attempting a new ArcSight Forwarding Connector installation.
To ensure a successful ArcSight ESM installation:
1 
2
3 Make sure that the ArcSight Manager, Database, and Console are installed correctly.Run the ArcSight Manager; the ArcSight Manager command prompt window or terminal box displays a Ready message when the Manager has started successfully. 
You can also monitor the server.std.log file located in ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\logs.
Run the ArcSight Console. Although not necessary, it is helpful to have the ArcSight Console running when installing the SmartConnector to verify successful installation.Before you install the SmartConnector, make sure you have the following available:
	Local access to the machine where the SmartConnector is to be installed
	Administrator passwords
Assigning Privileges on the Source Manager
Before installing the ArcSight Forwarding Connector, you need to create a Forwarding Connector account on the source Manager. After doing this, you can assign filters for incoming events.To assign privileges in the Manager: 
| 1 | Run the ArcSight Console on the ArcSight Source Manager. | Run the ArcSight Console on the ArcSight Source Manager. |
|---|---|---|

7 From the resulting menu, choose Edit Access Control.
From the Inspect/Edit window, click the Events tab under the new user type and assign the proper filters.For detailed instructions on assigning filters and other Arcsight Console functions, refer to the Administrator's Guide for your ESM version. 
Forwarding Correlation Events 
The ArcSight Forwarding Connector can forward events based upon the ACL assigned to the User Group on the source Manager. The connector can be configured to allow forwarding of ArcSight correlation events from the source Manager to the target (orArcSight Confidential SmartConnector™ Configuration Guide for ArcSight Forwarding Connector 9
1 Overview and Installation
destination) Manager. The ACL can also be configured to allow for viewing of the detailed 
chain of the forwarded correlation event, including the original correlated event.HP OM users commonly require only correlated events to be pulled from ESM. In such cases, HP OM users can specify the selection of correlated events. To allow for only correlated events and restrict the pulling of base events, configure ESM to pull correlated events, then allow the forwarding of correlated events, as described below. These steps should be performed in sequence, then restart the source Manager.The following steps should be performed in sequence, then restart the source Manager.
Configuring to Pull Correlated Events 
To configure the source Manager to send both correlation events and on-demand correlated events to the destination Manager, the ACL must contain two separate filters:
	Filter 1, provided with the latest version of ArcSight ESM:
/All Filters/ArcSight System/Event Types/ArcSight Correlation Events|  | Create Filter 2 containing the following conditions: | Create Filter 2 containing the following conditions: |
|---|---|---|
|  | |Event Annotation Flags ContainsBits correlated |
|  | |Both filters need to be applied to the Event Permissions of the User Group ACL to be able to extract correlated events from the correlation events that are  forwarded to the target Manager. |Correlated events pulled on-demand are for viewing only. They are not persisted in the destination Manager.
Configuring to Allow Forwarding of Correlated Events 
The Forwarding Connector can also be configured to automatically pull and forward correlated events irrespective of the User Group ACL. Only one forwarding connector per Manager can be configured to work in this mode. This configuration can aid in hierarchical deployment scenarios in which you need to automatically forward correlated events for further correlation and reporting on the destination Manager.The source Manager keeps track of the events that have been previously forwarded by using the “Forwarded” annotation, disallowing duplicates. 
To configure the source Manager to send both correlation events and correlated events automatically, you must specify the container ID. The container ID consists of two elements, the entityid and the userid. To begin the configuration, you must locate these two elements and combine them within the server.properties file.10 SmartConnector™ Configuration Guide for ArcSight Forwarding Connector ArcSight Confidential
1 Overview and Installation
1 To find the entityID, go to $AGENT_HOME/user/agent/agent.properties and search for agents[0].entityid. Copy the text string starting in 3w to a word or note program.
agents[0].entityid=3w+05uiYBABCCLKvzx0stdQ\==| 2 | To find the userid, go to the Console of the sourceManager.  | To find the userid, go to the Console of the sourceManager.  | To find the userid, go to the Console of the sourceManager.  |

Within $AGENT_HOME/config/server.properties on the source Manager, add the entityid and userid to the eventstream.cfc property, as shown below.
eventstream.cfc=EntityID.UserIDeventstream.cfc=EntityID.UserID
3 	Restart the source Manager and, if still running, the Forwarding Connector. 
Increasing the FileStore size (Enhanced version only)
Installation of the ArcSight Forwarding Connector (Enhanced) option provides fault-tolerance, enabling events to be saved in the event of a failure.The capacity of events that can be stored during a system failure is dependent on the amount of disk space the FileStore can use on the source Manager. Although the default size of 1024 MB (1 GB) is suitable for most installations, you can increase the size of your FileStore.
To increase the size of the FileStore:
1 Open the properties file server.defaults.properties, located under $ARCSIGHT_HOME\config.The file displays the current default: 
filestore.disksize.max.megabytes.int=1024
ArcSight Confidential SmartConnector™ Configuration Guide for ArcSight Forwarding Connector 11
1 Overview and Installation
2 Use this formula to determine appropriate rates for minutes of storage on your system:
MinutesOfStorage = (((#MB / 1024) * 21,474,833) / EPS) / 60
 Given the most typical event sizes, a FileStore of 1 GB can store approximately 21,474,833 events, and at a rate of 5000 events per second, the default size provides approximately 71 minutes of storage. 
When the FileStore fills up, the oldest events are purged to make room for recent ones.
