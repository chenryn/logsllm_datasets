DEFCON CHINA 1.0 BADGE hacking 
workshop
joe Grand aka kingpin
•informal environment
•a deeper look into the badge
•setup development environment
•modify/recompile CODE
•open lab
workshop goals
•complete tasks, get rewarded
•4 roots and 4 branches, each with 4 leds
•when task is complete, badge inserted into 
programmer to unlock LED
•when each root is complete, magic happens
•when all roots are complete, even magic happens

Schematic
USB INTERFACE
•allows for arduino programming and interactive 
mode
•FT231X USB-to-Serial UART
•entire usb protocol handled on-chip
•host will recognize as virtual serial device/com port
•mosfets for soft-start and power switchover
led matrix
•multiplexing via led matrix library
•row controlled by discrete i/O
•column controlled through 74hc595 shift register
•refresh @ 175hz to reduce flicker
•each led individually addressable, dimmable (16 levels)
accelerometer
•ST microelectronics LIS3DH
•3-axis digital output (i2c/SPI)
•+/- 2, 4, 8, 16g range
•interrupt on motion or free fall
•used to preserve battery life
•sleep mode @ 10 seconds of 
inactivity
•Raw values available through 
interactive mode
•edge connector as interface to the outside world
•UART, I2C, AVR ICSP
•used with programming shield to set/read state of 
badge leds

•ARDUINO
•open source platform based on easy-to-use 
hw/sw/FW
•worldwide community of users/contributors
•90% of FLash (27.6kB), 43% of RAM (887 bytes)
•loop
•set power state (battery, usb, usb charger)
•check for/process interactive mode
•check for/process fpc communication
•update leds
•sleep until accelerometer interrupt
Firmware
•led matrix
•Add #define swap() to .cpp to prevent compiling 
error
•Remove #defines for DIO2 pinMode and 
digitalWrite
•conflicted with my core code
