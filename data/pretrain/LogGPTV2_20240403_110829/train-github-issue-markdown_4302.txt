Currently the Configure Task Runner action generates a large task.json file
with many different task configurations, that the user has to clean-up
eventually, that is, delete the configs that do not apply.
Instead of generating one large file we should allow the user to select what
kind of task that should be configured and then to only generate this one.
This is similar to how we generate the launch configurations.
