Humans are the weakest link in cyber security â€“ or so the famous saying goes!  This talk will challenge this age old expression to focus on the human elements of the protection pillars; people, process, and technology.Organisations have an overwhelming focus on technology in cyber security defences including offensive red-team operations to highlight weaknesses. Yet the numbers of successful attacks are still increasing; both in frequency and impact.  It is time that as an industry we start to think differently about our approach; considering the human-centric notions as part of our technological advances, throughout our entire ecosystem and security lifecycle.  The aviation sector is a pioneer of this technique; so how is this thinking being adopted in the cyber security program of Airbus?
