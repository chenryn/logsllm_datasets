User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does "ESTABLISHED" state in netstat command for the sshd program mean they actually have access? I have this person(or bot) from an IP in Chile which has an "ESTABLISHED" connection to SSHD as root on my server.

I'm trying to understand what netstat's outputs really mean, the manual doesn't really provide much details about them. Here's what I get:

What I understand from the above output is that this person(or bot?) is changing ports every second and so a new PID for SSHD is created every time he(or it) "establishes" a connection. Am I right?

Next and more important thing I'd like to ask is does the "ESTABLISHED" state here mean that he(or it) actually has access to my server as the root user? Or if I'm right at my assumption above, does this mean he(or it) is scanning for ports in my server, still trying to get in?

Assistant: Established only means that the connection is fully open and data can be transmitted. It doesn't necessarily mean that any data has been transmitted! It doesn't imply anything about layer 7, whether someone has authenticated to your system or not. You can check your system logs to learn if someone has authenticated successfully.
