Anti-hacking law 
Communications law 
Intellectual property 
Criminal procedure 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 
(18 U.S.C. §1030)  
This is the federal anti-hacking law. 
Most states have something similar, too.  
CFAA basic prohibitions 
•  Accessing a government computer without authorization for 
espionage purposes 
 •  Accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of 
authorization and obtaining info from: 
 * a financial institution or credit reporting agency 
 * a government computer 
 * a "protected computer"  
 •  Trespassing upon a government system 
 •  Accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of 
authorization to defraud 
CFAA basic prohibitions 
•  Sending a program, information, code or command to a 
computer and intentionally causing damage 
 •  Intentionally accessing a protected computer w/ out 
authorization and  
 - recklessly causing "damage" or 
 - causing "damage and loss" 
 •  Trafficking in passwords or other authorization methods 
 •  Threatening to damage a computer (extortion) 
The biggest problem 
The CFAA prohibits, among other things, 
 “intentionally access[ing] a computer without 
authorization or in excess of authorization, and 
thereby obtain[ing] . . . information from any protected 
computer.” 
                                  18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(C)

Wha...? 
What makes access without “authorization”? 
•  Breaching a technological barrier meant to restrict 
access? 
•  Using unanticipated or novel technical means to 
access? 
•  Accessing for an improper purpose? 
Penalties 
 •  Both civil and criminal. 
•  Basic unauthorized access is a misdemeanor, but the 
statute has broad felony liability when: 
o  the illegal act is committed with intent to profit 
o  information obtained is worth more than $5,000 
o  act is in furtherance of a fraud, or 
o  repeat offense. 
Example 1 
Alice notices that her neighbor Bob is using a NinjaTel 
SketchyCom 5000 wifi AP/Router. She does a quick search 
online and discovers the default NinjaTel password is 
"password".  Alice decides to check if Bob has changed the 
default password, and if not, to suggest that Bob change it in 
order to protect Bob from evil hackers.  Alice is able to log into 
Bob's router using the default password.  But instead of warning 
Bob like she planned, Alice is hungry so she goes and gets 
tacos instead. 
- Is this unauthorized access?

Example 2 
Alice works at Applied Systems. According to Applied Systems' 
employment manual, employees are allowed to use company 
computers solely for business purposes. Alice has looked up 
and passed along client contact info to a former co-worker who 
recently left Applied Systems to start a competing business. 
Alice also tends to check her personal email a couple times a 
day on her company laptop.  
- Is Alice in legal trouble for passing along the client 
information?

Example 3 
Alice's favorite band is coming to town, and she wants to buy 
the best possible tickets the instant they go on sale. To get a 
jump on other fans, Alice writes a script to solve the CAPTCHA 
on the Ticketmaster website so that she doesn't have to type in 
the letters manually.

Communications law 
Two main federal laws: 
Wiretap Act  
(18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522) 
Pen Register/Trap and Trace Act  
(18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127) 
Wiretap Act 
•  Prohibits “interception”: acquisition by a device of the 
contents of an oral, wire, or electronic communication. 
 •  Also prohibits use or disclosure of illegal intercepts. 
•  Serious civil and criminal penalties. 
Important exceptions 
• Consent 
o Federal and most states require only one-party consent 
o Some states require all-party consent 
• Ordinary Course of Business: legitimate biz purpose, 
routine, & with notice 
• Provider Exception: OK if “necessary incident to the rendition 
of [electronic communication] service or to the protection of 
the rights or property of the provider of that service” 
• So…debugging or spam/virus/attack filtering on you network? 
Probably OK without consent.  Otherwise… 
Special issue: unencrypted wifi 
Whether the Wiretap Act makes it illegal to  
intercept unencrypted wifi is an open question  
currently before the courts. 
Maybe totally OK. 
Maybe completely off limits. 
Maybe depends on sophistication of your equipment. 
Maybe depends on channel and protocol. 
Pen Register Act 
•  Prohibits use of “pen registers” or “trap and trace devices” 
to acquire “dialing, routing, addressing or signaling” info. 
•  No general consent exception. Exception only for 
providers (for operation, maintenance, testing, protection 
of rights or property, protection of users from abuse, 
billing, etc.)  
•  Luckily, only a misdemeanor and no civil cause of action.   
Example 1 
Wanting to expand her knowledge about how the internet 
works, Alice installs a packet capturing program on her 
MacBook so that she can view internet traffic in detail.  She 
activates the program and records an IM conversation between 
herself and her friend Dave.  Alice does not ask Dave's 
permission.   
Is Alice in trouble in... 
- A one-party state?

Example 2 
Alice loves this whole packet capturing thing and wants to learn 
more about internet traffic in a real-life setting. She goes to her 
local coffee shop to see what traffic is sent over the open, 
unsecured wifi network. While there, Alice reads Ellen's IM 
conversation with Frank.  Alice does not ask anyone's 
permission.

Example 3 
After telling the coffee shop owner about the dangers of having 
an open wifi network, Alice gets hired as a network security 
administrator for the coffee shop.  As part of her diligent 
security review, Alice periodically captures traffic to look for 
suspicious activity.  One day, Alice notices that a coffee shop 
patron, Gigi, is using up almost all of the shop's bandwidth 
sharing torrents. Alice bans Gigi from the network. Alice also 
sees Ellen and Frank having an IM conversation and decides to 
read it, because you never know - it might contain something 
illegal.  Alice does not ask anyone's permission. 
- Is Alice in trouble? 
Some takeaways 
• Permission is your best friend 
 • Avoid sniffing packets on even your own network unless 
you've got consent or it's necessary to secure or provide the 
network service   
• Do no harm 
• Golden Rule: would you be okay with someone doing this to 
your network or device? 
• Don't hesitate to ask for legal advice - ask a friendly lawyer 
or the EFF, we're happy to help!
