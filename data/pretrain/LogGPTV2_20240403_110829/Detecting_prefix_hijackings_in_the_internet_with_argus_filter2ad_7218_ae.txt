Figure 21: Case studies of hijackings: ﬁngerprint and the number of polluted eyes.
In Fig. 21, for each hijacking with origin anomaly, we plot
the corresponding ﬁngerprint and the numbers of polluted
eyes in each second, to demonstrate the timely and accurate
reaction of Argus. We also indicate the time delay when
Argus begins or stops to report hijacking alarms by a dotted
line, if it exists. For other cases, since the curves are very
similar, we just present one of them, and omit the others
due to space limitations.
6.1 Hijackings with Origin Anomalies
Missing route ﬁlters: OA 1 was caused by a route ﬁl-
ter failure.
In this case, AS23910 learned two routes to
166.111.32.0/24 and 166.111.111.0/24, which were owned
by AS4538. The Network operators conﬁrmed that, since
AS23910 accidentally removed its corresponding ﬁlters for a
short period, these two routes were incorrectly redistribut-
ed into BGP, and then announced to the Internet, with
AS23910 as the origin. This corresponds to the period when
Ft > 0.6 in Fig. 21(a).
Network maintenance misplay:
in OA 2, AS50407
was a customer of the victim AS15763. The network opera-
tors of AS50407 said they made a mistake when they were
carrying out network maintenance, and hijacked the preﬁx
193.105.17.0/24 for 12 minutes. In Fig. 21(b), after the hi-
jacking was detected, the ﬁngerprint kept above 0.6 for the
remaining window.
Premature migration attempt: OA 3 was caused by
a premature route migration that was not well planned. In
this case, AS197279 was to migrate 91.217.242.0/24 to an-
other AS AS48559 “in the coming week or so”, as said in
their reply to our alarm. However, before the planned time,
AS48559 announced itself as the owner of this preﬁx, which
AS197279 was still keeping announcing at that time. Since
live hosts have not moved into AS48559, polluted eyes could
not reach them, and Ft increased above 0.6. The hijacking
lasted about 17 minutes and Argus detected it within 9 sec-
onds, as shown in Fig. 21(c). OA 4 is a similar case, where
AS27005 announced the same preﬁx as AS701 did. There is
a little diﬀerence from OA 3: live hosts in AS27005 became
reachable after 70 seconds (still in the detection window),
while live hosts in AS701 also kept reachable until several
hours later, so Ft later decreased to 0 in Fig. 21(d).
Sub-preﬁx hijacking: OA 5 was conﬁrmed by AS7018,
which was the owner of a preﬁx 12.128.0.0/9. One of its
sub-preﬁxes, 12.231.155.0/24, was incorrectly announced by
AS13490 at March 22, 2012, and the hijacking lasted about
16 minutes. As shown in Fig. 21(e), this sub-preﬁx hijacking
polluted around 20 eyes in 20 seconds, which is faster than
the other cases. Interestingly, we also noticed that this sub-
preﬁx was oﬃcially assigned to and announced by AS54357
nine days later, and Argus successfully detected that event
and classiﬁed it as a route migration (i.e., the ﬁngerprint
was close to -1.0).

of AA 1, AS24465 was connecting to two providers, and was
using AS-Path prepending (ASPP) to achieve inbound Traf-
ﬁc Engineering. It normally announced its preﬁx 210.1.38.0/24
to one provider AS4750, but prepended itself for 4 times
in the AS-path announced to the other provider AS7693.
The hijacking happened when AS24465 connected to a new
provider AS38794 and announced the preﬁx to it. However
traﬃc could not go through the new one, and Argus immedi-
ately notiﬁed the operators of AS38794. When they replied
50 minutes later, we found the problem was ﬁxed, and ASPP
was also used in the new route.
AS-path poisoning experiment: AA 2 was caused by
a rerouting experiment launched by Georgia Tech and Uni-
versity of Washington [19], using AS47065. They announced
a looped path h47065, x, 47065i for preﬁx 184.164.255.0/24,
so that AS x would not accept this route later, and the
corresponding traﬃc would not go through x. They repeat-
ed the experiments periodically for many times, and Argus
continuously reported adjacency anomalies. If things went
well, we should have identiﬁed no hijackings, since the desti-
nation should be reachable even when the path changed. 18
However, in an experiment when x was set to 19782, the tar-
get preﬁx became unreachable on our eyes that were using
the new path, but was still reachable on the eyes that were
using the normal path without loop, and Argus reported
hijackings accordingly.
Short-lived neighbor: AA 3 was caused by AS17368
pretending to be a neighbor of AS26263, which was the own-
er of the victim preﬁx 205.153.112.0/22. The hijacking pol-
luted 4 eyes, and lasted 14 minutes. Later, this adjacency
disappeared and was never announced again.
6.3 Hijackings with Policy Anomalies
Import policy violation: PA 1 was caused by an im-
port ﬁlter failure of AS21021. As described by the IRR
records of AS21021 (Fig.
it will import a route
