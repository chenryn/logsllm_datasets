## Abstract
The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the de facto standard for document exchange worldwide. To ensure the authenticity and integrity of documents, digital signatures are employed. Numerous public and private services, including governments, public enterprises, banks, and payment services, rely on the security of PDF signatures. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security evaluation of digital signatures in PDFs. We introduce three novel attack classes that bypass the cryptographic protection of digitally signed PDF files, allowing an attacker to spoof the content of a signed PDF. We analyzed 22 different PDF viewers and found 21 of them to be vulnerable, including widely used applications such as Adobe Reader DC and Foxit. Additionally, we evaluated eight online validation services and found six to be vulnerable. The absence of a standardized algorithm for verifying PDF signatures is a possible explanation for these results, as each client verifies signatures differently, and attacks can be tailored to these differences. Therefore, we propose the standardization of a secure verification algorithm, which we describe in this paper. All findings have been responsibly disclosed, and the affected vendors were supported during the resolution process. As a result, three generic CVEs for each attack class were issued [50–52]. Our research on PDF signatures and more information is available at https://www.pdf-insecurity.org/.

## 1. Introduction
Introduced in 1993 by Adobe Systems, the Portable Document Format (PDF) was designed to provide a consistent presentation of documents, independent of the operating system and hardware. Today, PDF has become the standard for electronic documents in daily workflows. According to Adobe System’s Vice President of Engineering, Phil Ydens, there were about 1.6 billion PDF files on the web in 2015, with 80% created in the same year, leading to an estimated 2.5 trillion PDF files created since 2015. PDF files are extensively used for exchanging information, creating and archiving invoices and contracts, submitting scientific papers, and collaborating on texts.

### PDF Digital Signatures
Since 1999, the PDF specification has supported digital signatures to ensure that a document was created or approved by a specific person and has not been altered afterward. PDF digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography, where the signer possesses a public and private key pair. The signer uses their private key to create the digital signature. Any subsequent modification invalidates the signature and triggers an error message from the PDF viewer or validation service. PDF digital signatures should not be confused with electronic signatures, which are the electronic equivalent of handwritten signatures and do not provide cryptographic protection, making them trivial to spoof.

In 2000, President Bill Clinton enacted the eSign Act, facilitating the use of electronic and digital signatures in interstate and foreign commerce by ensuring the validity and legal effect of contracts. Since 2014, organizations delivering public digital services in EU member states are required to support digitally signed documents, which are admissible as evidence in legal proceedings. Several countries, including Brazil, Canada, Russia, and Japan, also use and accept digitally signed documents. In the private sector, digitally signed PDFs are used for signing invoices and contracts, and in academia, they are used to sign scientific papers.

### Novel Attacks on PDF Signatures
In this paper, we demonstrate how to spoof a digitally signed PDF document. Our attacks require access to a signed PDF (e.g., an Amazon invoice). Given such a PDF, our attacks allow an attacker to change the PDF's content arbitrarily without invalidating its signature. Plausible attack scenarios include manipulating the billing date on a digitally signed receipt to extend the warranty period or altering contract information to gain more resources than agreed upon.

We systematically analyze the verification process of PDF signatures in various desktop applications and server implementations and introduce three novel attack classes. Each class provides a blueprint for an attacker to modify a validly signed PDF file in a way that the targeted viewer displays the altered content without detecting the changes. On a technical level, each attack class abuses a different step in the signature validation logic.

1. **Universal Signature Forgery (USF)**: Manipulates metadata in the signature so that the targeted viewer opens the PDF, finds the signature, but cannot find all necessary data for validation. Instead of treating the missing information as an error, it shows that the contained signature is valid.
2. **Incremental Saving Attack (ISA)**: Abuses a legitimate feature of the PDF specification, which allows updating a PDF file by appending changes. This feature is used, for example, to store annotations or add new pages while editing the file. The ISA uses the same technique to change elements such as text or whole pages in the signed PDF file. The PDF specification does not forbid this, but the signature validation should indicate that the document has been altered after signing. We introduce four variants of ISA that mask the modifications without raising any warnings.
3. **Signature Wrapping Attack (SWA)**: Targets the signature validation logic by relocating the originally signed content to a different position within the document and inserting new content at the allocated position. We introduce three different variants of SWA to bypass the signature validation.

### Large-Scale Evaluation
We provide the first large-scale evaluation covering 22 different PDF viewers installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. We systematically analyzed the security of the signature validation on each viewer and found signature bypasses in 21 out of 22 viewers, including Adobe Reader DC and Foxit. Additionally, we analyzed eight online validation services supporting signature verification of signed PDF files and found six of them to be vulnerable to at least one of the attacks, including DocuSign, one of the world's leading cloud services for electronic signatures.

The results are attributed to the following factors:
1. There is almost no related work regarding the security of digitally signed PDF files, even though integrity protection has been part of the PDF specification since 1999.
2. The PDF specification does not provide an implementation guideline or best-practices document for signature validation. Thus, developers implement a security-critical component without a thorough understanding of the actual risks.

### Contributions
- We developed three novel attack classes on PDF signatures, each targeting a different step in the signature validation process and enabling an attacker to bypass a PDF's integrity protection completely.
- We provide the first in-depth security analysis of PDF applications. The results are alarming: out of 22 popular desktop viewers, we could bypass the signature validation in 21 cases.
- We additionally analyzed eight online validation services used within the European Union and worldwide for validating signed documents. We could bypass the signature validation in six cases.
- Based on our experiences, we developed a secure signature validation algorithm and communicated it with the application vendors during the responsible disclosure process.
- By providing the first in-depth analysis of PDF digital signatures, we pave the way for future research, revealing new insights and showing novel research aspects regarding PDF security.

### Responsible Disclosure
In cooperation with the BSI-CERT, we contacted all vendors, provided proof-of-concept exploits, and helped them fix the issues. As a result, the following three generic CVEs for each attack class covering all affected vendors were issued [50–52].

## 2. PDF Basics
This section covers the foundations of the Portable Document Format (PDF). We provide an overview of the file structure and explain how the PDF standard for signatures is implemented.

### 2.1 Portable Document Format (PDF)
A PDF consists of four parts: header, body, xref table, and trailer, as depicted in Figure 3.

- **Header**: The header is the first line in a PDF and defines the interpreter version to be used. For example, "PDF 1.7" indicates the version.
- **Body**: The body specifies the content of the PDF and contains text blocks, fonts, images, and metadata. The main building blocks within the body are objects, each starting with an object number followed by a generation number. The generation number should be incremented if additional changes are made to the object.
- **Xref Table**: The Xref table contains information about all PDF objects. It can contain one or more sections, each starting with two integer entries (a b) indicating the number of objects described in the following lines.
- **Trailer**: The trailer is processed first when a PDF file is read into memory. It contains references to the Catalog and the Xref table.

### 2.2 Creating a PDF Signature
This section explains how a digitally signed PDF file is built.

- **Incremental Saving**: PDF signatures rely on a feature called incremental saving, which allows the modification of a PDF file without changing the previous content. Incremental saving involves attaching a new body, Xref table, and trailer at the end of the file.
- **Structure of a Signed PDF**: The creation of a digital signature on a PDF file relies on incremental saving by extending the original document with objects containing the signature information. A new Catalog, Signature object, Xref table, and Trailer are added. The new Catalog extends the old one by adding a Perms parameter, which defines restrictions for changes within the document. The Signature object includes information about the applied cryptographic algorithms for hashing and signing the document.

By providing a detailed analysis of PDF digital signatures, we aim to highlight the importance of secure signature validation and pave the way for future research in this area.
