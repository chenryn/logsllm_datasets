User: How to arrange containers and automate deployment to build elastic and scalable applications and services on the cloud?
Assistant: Container orchestration and automated deployment is the process of building elastic and scalable applications and services on the cloud by using container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesos. Here are some best practices to use in a modern development process: 1. Design and develop applications using a cloud-native approach to leverage the potential of containers and cloud-native technologies. 2. Modularize applications so they can be easily packaged and deployed in containers. 3. Leverage container orchestration tools to manage the lifecycle of containerized applications. This makes it easy to map containers to hosts, monitor resources and health, and scale up and down to meet business needs. 4. Reduce manual operations and increase productivity by using tools to automate deployment, testing, release, and updating of applications. 5. Learn and apply elastic architecture principles to ensure applications scale properly during load fluctuations. 6. Choose cloud infrastructure and services that can easily integrate container orchestration tools and use these services to find application-related issues and easily complete deployments.
