 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
As it says. (I'm talking about the class-level column attributes that can be
used like `.filter(User.name == "bob)" etc.)
I suppose there's a logical technical reason for this behaviour, but I think
it's still rather unexpected from the perspective of the user. I spent a while
tracking down some bugs I was having because of this.
