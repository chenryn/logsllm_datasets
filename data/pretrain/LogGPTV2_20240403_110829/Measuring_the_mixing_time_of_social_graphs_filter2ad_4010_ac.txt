### Figure 3: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Mixing Time for the Three Physics Datasets

**Description:**
Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the mixing time for the three physics datasets listed in Table 1. The variation distance is computed for every possible node in the graph using a brute-force approach.

**Graph Details:**
- **Y-Axis:** Variation Distance
- **X-Axis:** Mixing Time (Walk Length)

**Key Points:**
- The CDF shows the distribution of mixing times across all nodes.
- The variation distance is calculated for each node, providing a comprehensive view of the mixing behavior.
- The lower-bound and different percentile ranges (Top 99.9%, 40%-60%, 0%-10%) are indicated to highlight the variability in mixing times.

### Figure 5: Lower-Bound of Mixing Time Compared to Sampling Method

**Description:**
Figure 5 compares the lower-bound of the mixing time with the mixing time measured using the sampling method for the entire graphs. The brute-force approach ensures that different measurements meet the guarantees.

**Graph Details:**
- **Y-Axis:** Variation Distance
- **X-Axis:** Mixing Time (Walk Length)

**Key Points:**
- The lower-bound and different percentile ranges (Top 99.9%, 40%-60%, 0%-10%) are shown.
- The mixing time is higher than anticipated, indicating that about 75% of nodes are denied joining the service to boost the mixing time.
- The results apply to both isolated and faster-mixing parts of the graph.

### Discussion

**Main Findings:**
- The mixing time of social graphs is higher than previously reported in the literature.
- Different nodes approach the stationary distribution at different rates, with the majority of walks reaching closer to the stationary distribution at a higher rate than the defined mixing time.
- The mixing time for most nodes is larger than anticipated, which has several implications.

**Implications:**
1. **Theoretical Guarantees:**
   - Most theoretical guarantees for social graphs are based on the worst-case mixing time. However, the average case of the mixing time is relatively small.
   - Future studies should focus on the average case of the mixing time to provide more realistic and practical designs.

2. **Utility vs. Performance:**
   - To achieve better utility, shorter random walks can be used, but this may compromise performance and security.
   - Longer random walks can reach isolated parts of the graph, but they also risk escaping to the Sybil region, which has similar characteristics to the slower-mixing part of the graph.

3. **Sybil Defenses:**
   - Experiments on SybilGuard, SybilLimit, and WhƒÅnau show that these schemes work as expected despite using short mixing times.
   - Trimming lower-degree nodes can shorten the mixing time, and a slightly larger \(\epsilon\) might still be sufficient for these schemes to work.
   - The difference between the average and worst-case mixing times may explain the discrepancy between analysis and experiments.

4. **Trust Model:**
   - The trust model in social networks, such as DBLP and Physics co-authorship networks, requires physical acquaintance, leading to slower mixing times compared to online social networks with less strict trust models.
   - The trust model and mixing time should be considered together to evaluate the effectiveness of social network-based defenses.

### Performance Implications: SybilLimit

**Description:**
To measure the impact of slower mixing times on the performance of Sybil defenses, we implemented SybilLimit and observed the following:

**Graph Details:**
- **Y-Axis:** Variation Distance
- **X-Axis:** Mixing Time (Walk Length)

**Key Points:**
- The lower-bound and different percentile ranges (Top 99.9%, 40%-60%, 0%-10%) are shown.
- The mixing time for various social networks (Facebook A, Facebook B, Livejournal A, Livejournal B) is analyzed.
- The results indicate that the mixing time is generally higher, which affects the performance and security of Sybil defenses.

By considering the average mixing time and the trust model, future research can provide more accurate and effective Sybil defenses.
