5. DISCUSSION
While the main ﬁnding in this study is that the mixing time of
social graphs is higher than has been used in literature, we also
conclude that different nodes approach the stationary distribution
at different rates. This is, while the majority of walks initiated
from different nodes reach closer to the stationary distribution at
“higher” rate than that of the mixing time, which is deﬁned as the
maximum rate from any source, we still ﬁnd—except in a few cases
of online social networks—that the mixing time of the majority of
nodes is larger than anticipated and used in the previous studies [30,
31, 12]. This has several implications and call for several actions.
First, since most of the theoretical guarantees of social graphs
consider the model in (2), and since the majority of nodes in the
social graphs measured in this paper have better mixing time than
the bound in that model, this calls for rigorous study by basing such
designs and analyses on the average case of the mixing, which is
relatively small, instead of the worst case of the mixing time.
Second, the obvious implication of our ﬁndings is that one has to
either give up some of the utility (service) guarantees—which are
implied by that almost all honest nodes admit other honest nodes—
by using relatively shorter walks, or give up part of the performance
and security by enabling longer random walks in order to reach
these isolated parts of the social graphs. Though this looks straight-
forward, going either way is not as simple as it seems. On the one
hand, if one uses longer random walks in order to reach such iso-
lated parts of the network it would be equally likely to escape to
the Sbyil region which has a cut similar in its nature to that of the
slower mixing part of the original social graph. On the other hand,
using random walks shorter than the mixing time of the majority of
nodes would would also be at the expense of the utility; not only
Third, papers introducing SybilGuard, SybilLimit, and Wh¯anau
all did experiments on their schemes. Despite the short mixing
time that these experiments use, their results seem to support that
their schemes work as expected. The explanation of this is two part.
First, the trimming of lower-degree nodes would shorten the mixing
time. Second, although they claim that the social networks are fast
mixing and as a part of the deﬁnition—which is also used in parts of
the proofs for the theoretical guarantees—they insist  = Θ(1/n),
this is a very strong burden to achieve and perhaps somewhat larger
 might also be good enough for these schemes to work. Also, we
suspect that the difference between the average mixing time and the
worst-case mixing time may have some effects on the discrepancy
between the analysis and the experiment. In practice, the majority
of nodes with “fast” mixing would be served and those few other
nodes with very slow mixing would be denied service, which then
will not be a problem for the probabilistic average-case guarantees.
Finally, one of the assumptions in Sybil defenses based on social
networks is that the used trust model requires physical acquain-
tance, which is the case in social networks such DBLP and Physics
co-authorship networks, for which we show slower mixing time
than other “online social networks” which are known to possess
less strict trust models [5, 1], which by nature tolerate Sybil nodes.
This calls for considering the trust model resulting from the under-
lying social network as a parameter, along with the mixing time,
in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the social network-based
defenses according to their real value. Our work in [16, 15] is a
preliminarily result in this direction.
Performance Implications—the case of SybilLimit: in order to
quantitively measure the impact of the ﬁndings of slower mixing
time on the performance of Sybil defenses, we implement Sybil-
