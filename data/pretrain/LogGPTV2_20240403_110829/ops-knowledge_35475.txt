User: How to perform server security hardening and vulnerability scanning?
Assistant: Server security reinforcement: 1. Firewall settings: Set up a firewall on the server to allow only required ports and service traffic to pass through, and close unnecessary ports, such as SSH. 2. Operating system security hardening: timely upgrade the operating system and its software to reduce the utilization of operating system and its software defects. 3. Password security management: strictly control the passwords of administrators, and standardize the password management methods of administrators. 4. Data encryption: encrypt and store important data related to personal information, financial information, etc. 5. System log management: establish system log management specifications, monitor and respond to abnormal events in a timely manner. Vulnerability scanning: 1. Scanning with tools: Use vulnerability scanning tools, such as Nessus, Acunetix, etc., to conduct a comprehensive scan on the server, identify and report possible vulnerabilities for timely repair. 2. Security assessment: Conduct regular security assessments, conduct in-depth penetration tests on the system, identify existing loopholes and their hazards, and repair them in time. 3. Access log management: Manage the access log of the system, regularly check the system access status, and discover abnormal access behaviors in time. 4. Regularly update and upgrade: Regularly upgrade the operating system and software to fix known vulnerabilities and enhance server security. 5. Management authority control: Control the sensitive information in the server or the centralized management authority of the system, stipulate the use authority of sensitive authority, and prevent it from being used by criminals.
