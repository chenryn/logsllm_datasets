The control height classes listed on http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-
control-sizes do not match the classes that actually exists in bootstrap.css
and bootstrap.min.css.
`.input-lg` is shown in the documentation,but `.input-large` is configured in
the css. Likewise, `.input-sm` is shown in the documentation, but `.input-
small` is configured.
