Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
Webpack 4.5 cannot be configured to create JavaScript files that both: a)
bundle shared modules and b) runs them.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
The following markup shows the use case of a large app that has pages that
assumes a babel-polyfilled environment and may depend on either React or
jQuery or both. A page often has a corresponding Webpack entry that shouldn't
redundantly bundle babel-polyfill, React, jQuery, or the Webpack runtime.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Webpack 3 and it's CommonsChunkPlugin supported this feature.
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version, and Operating System.**
Webpack 4.5, Node 8.2, OS X 10.12.6.
