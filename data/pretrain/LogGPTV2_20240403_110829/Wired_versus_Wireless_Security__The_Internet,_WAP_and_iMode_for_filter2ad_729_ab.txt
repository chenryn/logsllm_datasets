### Session Establishment and Network Protocols

**Session Established with the Enterprise’s Web Server**

This issue is thoroughly discussed in Section 5.3.

**iMode Networking Environment**

iMode, a proprietary protocol of NTT DoCoMo in Japan, provides Internet services using Personal Digital Cellular-Packet (PDC-P) and a subset of HTML 3.0. This allows application and content providers to distribute software (such as Java applets) to cellular phones and enables users to download and send applets (e.g., games). iMode utilizes packet-switched communication, which is carried over TCP/IP for the wired part of the communication.

#### Packet Switching

Packet switching divides messages into small blocks called packets, each with headers containing address and control information. This method allows multiple communications to be carried on a common channel, leading to efficient and cost-effective channel usage.

**DoPa Service**

"DoPa," DoCoMo's dedicated data communications service, applies the principle of packet switching to the wireless section as well. The mobile packet communications system integrates this function into DoCoMo’s PDC, the digital system for portable and automobile telephones.

**Network Configuration**

- **Mobile Message Packet Gateway (M-PGW)**: Handles conversions between different protocol formats.
- **iMode Server**: Can reside at NTT DoCoMo or at the enterprise. DoCoMo typically maintains the iMode server, but it can be hosted at the enterprise for advanced security requirements.

**Example iMode Sites**

- Standard iMode site: [http://ww.kyoto-bauc.or.jp/i](http://ww.kyoto-bauc.or.jp/i) (requires a Kanji-enabled browser)
- SSL-protected iMode site: [https://kabu.com](https://kabu.com)

### Wired and Wireless Protocols

This section introduces the two wireless protocols, WAP and iMode, and discusses their similarities and differences. For detailed information on wired protocols like SSL/TLS and TCP/IP, refer to available references.

#### WAP Specification

The WAP specification defines an open, standard architecture and a set of protocols for wireless Internet access. Key components include:

- **Wireless Markup Language (WML)**: An XML-type markup language with tags suitable for wireless devices. WML content is accessed via HTTP 1.1 requests.
- **Microbrowser Specification**: Defines how WML and WMLScript are interpreted on wireless handsets.
- **Lightweight Protocol Stack**: Minimizes bandwidth requirements, allowing different wireless networks to run WAP applications. The Wireless Session Protocol (WSP) is the equivalent of HTTP in a compressed format.
- **Framework for Wireless Telephony Applications (WTA)**: Provides access to traditional telephony services through WMLScript.
- **Provisioning**: Allows service providers to reconfigure mobile phones remotely using SMS.

**WAP Protocol Stack**

- **WML/WBXML**
- **WMLScript**
- **WSP**
- **WTP**
- **WTLS**
- **WCMP**
- **WDP & Adaptation Layer**

#### iMode Specification

iMode is a proprietary service currently only available in Japan. The protocol details are not publicly available, but the following information is based on personal experience and resources cited in this paper.

**iMode Protocol Stacks**

- **cHTML (Compact HTML)**: A subset of HTML used for representing online content. Users can view both cHTML and traditional HTML pages.
- **SSL/TLS**: Provides transport layer security based on Internet protocols.
- **TL and LAPD-M Protocols**: Standards of the Association of Radio Industries and Business (ARIB).

**iMode Protocol Stack Diagram**

- **Cellular Phone**: cHTML, HTTP, SSL/TLS, TL, Call Control, LAPD-M, Physical Layer
- **Internet Protocol Stack**: HTML, XML, JavaScript, Java, HTTP, SSL/TLS, TCP, IP, Link Layer, Physical Layer
- **Mobile-Packet Gateway Module**: Packet Processing Module, Wireless Proprietary Network, IP (PMAP), Link Layer, Physical Layer

### Security Features

#### Wired Security

Most e-commerce applications run over TCP/IP protocols. Resources such as HTML pages or Java-based content are accessed using HTTP. For sensitive resources, an SSL session is established, prompted by the back-end, and can be either server-side or mutually authenticated SSL.
