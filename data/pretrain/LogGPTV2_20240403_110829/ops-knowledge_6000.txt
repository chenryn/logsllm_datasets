User: I installed Python3.5 in Linux machine using configure, make, make install and made it default over existing Python2.6 . Now I want to uninstall Python 3.5 as it is not supporting zlib. How do I uninstall default Python 3.5. Linux is RHEL6.7.
Assistant: Because python is integral into the RHEL OS, please explain what you mean by:
"and made it default over existing Python2.6 ." Otherwise attempts to "uninstall" your working python install might leave you with a broken RHEL install.
