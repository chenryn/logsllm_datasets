the proportion of Ingress – Egress pairs for which we were able to
reveal the content of hidden tunnels. The next three columns pro-
vide raw statistics about revealed MPLS LSPs for those candidates.

LSRs” gives the number of unique IP addresses revealed. The last
column is the proportion of those revealed IP addresses also identi-
ﬁed as Ingress or Egress LER. Finally, the column “Graph Density”
indicates how the density15 of those ISP graphs is corrected when
revealing invisible MPLS tunnels. It is worth noticing that the den-
sity is, here, computed only based on Ingress – Egress pairs (and
not on the whole ISP graph).
5.1 Path Revelation with DPR and BRPR
In our measurement campaign, a total of 13,771 invisible tunnels
were revealed. Among this number, 8,477 were elicited by DPR,
2,270 by BRPR and, ﬁnally, 3,024 were too short (i.e., LSP made of
a single hop) to determine which measurement technique applies.
The additional probing induced by BRPR (i.e., the recursion to re-
veal the tunnel content) was 8,180 probes.
Fig. 5 illustrates the revealed tunnels length as the number of
hops (X-axis) required to reach the tunnel exit point (i.e., Egress
LER). A value of 2 means thus a tunnel made of a single LSR. Note
that a tunnel of length 1 cannot hide an LSR. The Y-axis provides
the raw number of IP addresses acting as Egress LER. The red dot
refers to very short tunnels, i.e., a single LSR. In that case, DPR and
BRPR are indistinguishable. The distribution does not really look
like a power-law with a strong shape and heavy tail. But still, this is

a strongly decreasing function bounded with relatively short tun-
nels, i.e, very few of them exceed 12 hops. This tunnel length distri-
bution is aligned with previous results on visible tunnels [19, 36].
We can also observe on Fig. 5 that the distributions for DPR and
BRPR behave diﬀerently. This is because DPR discovers the whole
tunnel with only one additional trace while BRPR needs one trace
for each IP address. A signiﬁcant share of its attempts may fail be-
fore discovering the whole tunnel, resulting in shorter average tun-
nels. Table 4 shows the number of newly discovered IP addresses
for revealed LSPs (column “#IPs LSRs”).
Fig. 6 shows the RTT evolution for each hop of a trace traversing
an invisible tunnel in AS3549. When the tunnel is invisible (blue
dashed line), we observe a jump of about 50 ms in the RTT values
between hops 8 (Ingress LER) and 9 (Egress LER). However, once
the tunnel has been revealed (black curve), this large delay is actu-
ally decomposed between the seven hops of the tunnel.
5.2 Return vs. Forward Asymmetry
Fig. 7 provides the Return & Forward Asymmetry (RFA) distri-
bution. This distribution is based on FRPLA, i.e., it reveals the ac-
tual return path length (in terms of IP hops) while the forward
path length is underestimated due to the invisibility of the forward
tunnel. With RFA, a value of 0 in the distribution is inconclusive
for us as it means that return and forward paths have the same
length. Similarly, a negative value in the distribution (the return

path is shorter than the forward one) does not bring any informa-
tion about a potential invisible tunnel. Finally, a positive value is
the ideal case for us, as the return path is longer than the forward
one. We can therefore assume the presence of an invisible tunnel.
Fig. 7a provides the RFA distribution in several cases. First, we
have a look at paths not involved in MPLS tunnels or HDNs, i.e.,
the red curve (“Others” means any IP address except those tagged
as HDN) and the black curve (IP address identiﬁed as HDN Ingress
LER). In both cases, the path asymmetry follows a normal law cen-
tered in 0, with a median value of 1, the symmetry being not per-
fect. In general, paths between two nodes in the Internet are not
the same in both directions. It is due to, among others, BGP hot-
potato routing. However, on average over a large number of pairs,
the distribution should be (almost) symmetrical.
However, the story is diﬀerent when HDNs are classiﬁed as
Egress LER in our campaign (blue curve on Fig. 7a: they are Egress
LERs for which we revealed nodes on the forward path – “PR”
means “Path Revelation”): the normal law is now signiﬁcantly shifted
towards positive values (median of 4) and a bit ﬂattened out as
three values show almost the same level of density (diﬀerence of
0, 1, and 2 hops). We also considered all Egress LERs, even those
where we do not ﬁnd any forward paths with a Path Revelation
technique (red curve on Fig. 7b – NPR means “No Path Revela-
tion”). Since it underestimates the diﬀerence when comparing it to
Egress LERs for which we reveal a forward path (Egress PR), we
can conclude that FRPLA and RTLA are not really eﬃcient when
path revelation does not work either. Generally speaking, the dif-
ference observed between the Egress curve and the other curves is
due to the return tunnel path length, following a kind of power-law,
that is taken into account with FRPLA. This signiﬁcant shifting of
the median is a direct consequence of the forward tunnel invisibil-
ity. Indeed, the forward path length does not include the hidden
hops, while the complete return path length is obtained based on
the TTL in the ICMP replies sent by the Egress LER.
Fig. 7b tries to ﬁx this shift by using the actual lengths of for-
ward paths revealed by DPR or BRPR. This cross validation is per-
formed on the intersection of the path revelation methods and FR-
