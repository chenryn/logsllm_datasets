Currently there are duplicated checks (e.g. java location and version) in
`lib/src/android/android_workflow.dart` and
`lib/src/android/android_studio.dart`.
There should be one canonical Java locator / version checker that is shared
between all components that need it (Android build steps, Flutter doctor
checks, etc).
