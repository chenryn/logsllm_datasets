User: I'm using App Engine with Python. My application basically sends vcards (.vcf) by email when users request it. 
Indeed, files with .vcf extension are supported by App Engine. I use the mail API to send them as attachment. Before, I stored them as db.Blob().
Problem:
Most of the time, Blackberry users cannot read the vcards sent as attachments by my application. At the bottom of the mail, it displays: "application/X-rimdeviceAddress Book:" and when you click on the file, it says: "This type of attachment cannot be opened on your device". 
Exception:
A blackberry that receives a vcard serialized from a Blackberry can open it.
Fortunately, it perfectly works on the iPhone and (most of the time) on Android phones. 
As vcards serialized from a Blackberry can be correctly opened by Blackberry users, I guess I'm doing something wrong during the storage and/ or the mail dispatch. Or maybe, the MIME type is not correctly set by App Engine methods... 
Can someone give a few leads to investigate this pretty annoying problem (I was expecting a pretty big user base on Blackberry phones...)?
Assistant: Obviously as I mentioned on my comment above:
- it has nothing to do with Google App Engine
- some devices are just not able to read vcards in format 3.0 
But I haven't found a good parser/ converter so far (from vcard 3.0 to vcard 2.1 in python) so if anyone knows one, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to build it myself...
