I am currently using Google App Engine with Python to develop an application that sends vCard (.vcf) files as email attachments upon user request. While the .vcf file format is supported by App Engine, I have encountered a specific issue: BlackBerry users often cannot open the vCard attachments sent from my application. The email displays "application/X-rimdeviceAddress Book:" at the bottom, and when attempting to open the attachment, users receive the message, "This type of attachment cannot be opened on your device."

Interestingly, vCards generated and serialized on a BlackBerry can be successfully opened by other BlackBerry devices, indicating a potential problem with the way my application processes or stores these files. Currently, I store the vCards as `db.Blob()` and use the mail API to send them as attachments. Despite this, the issue does not occur on iPhone and most Android devices.

I suspect that the problem might be related to the MIME type set by App Engine's methods, or it could be due to how the vCards are being stored and dispatched. Another possibility is that some devices, including certain BlackBerry models, may not support vCard 3.0 format, which could be the cause of the incompatibility.

I have already determined that the issue is unrelated to Google App Engine itself. It seems that some devices, particularly older BlackBerry models, are unable to read vCards in version 3.0. To address this, I am looking for a reliable parser or converter that can transform vCard 3.0 files into the more widely supported vCard 2.1 format within a Python environment. If anyone has recommendations for such a tool, I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise, I will need to develop a custom solution to handle this conversion.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions or guidance.
