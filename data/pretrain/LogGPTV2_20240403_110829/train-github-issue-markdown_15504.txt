There are four IDCount functions:
  * THREE.GeometryIdCount()
  * THREE.MaterialIdCount()
  * THREE.Object3DIdCount()
  * THREE.TextureIdCount()
They are part of the API (can be accessed via THREE.GeometryIdCount() etc. )
so they should be documented.
The question is, where? Should they get a separate page, or be included in the
Geometry, Material... pages?
