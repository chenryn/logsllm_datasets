User: Months ago,I installed pycharm 4.5 in Ubuntu(by run /bin/pycharm.sh),it works well.
Now I found 5.0 version is released.I download the .tar.gz file and unzip it.Then I want to install it in the same way.
But a matter is ,although it runs well, in launcher I found the icon of Pycharm becomes a big "?".Also,in terminal,it gives some warn:

log4j:warn no appenders could be found for logger (io.netty.util.internal.logging.internalloggerfactory).  log4j:warn please initialize the log4j system properly.

What that mean?and is it the right way to install Pycharm?
Assistant: Delete the old Pycharm directory and replace it with the new one. Now run pycharm.sh from the termin to start Pycharm. Once opened, go to Tools> Create desktop entry.
Once this is done, close the current instance and now the new icon should appear in the launcher.
