I do understand that box-sizing: border-box; is perfect way to go for all box
models but you guys are forgetting yourself or you are just asking Bootstrap
users to drop it.
Instead of applying box-sizing: border-box; where you need it you went the
other way around and just threw this in .
    * {
      -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
         -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
              box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    *:before,
    *:after {
      -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
         -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
              box-sizing: border-box;
    }
You even utilize normalize.css where in fact they were very cautious where to
use it.

I am not sure if you are aware how many websites are using bootstrap in
conjunction with other plugins and scripts, or just as an addon for stylish
buttons and forms. With this you are braking layouts left and right.
On Stackoverflow many posts are coming up with this exact issue.
OK Paul Irish  
http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/  
but this late in a game and as a wildcard is irresponsible. Paul suggested
this as a perfect solution and it works for people who are building something
from scratch. But majority of your users are implementing Bootstrap in
existing web layouts.
You deliver a file that is over 6k lines , if you took some time and just
lineup where exactly you need border-box that would be perfect way to go.
.row,  
.form-group,  
.form-control  
.checkbox  
and few others would save the headache for many people out-there..
