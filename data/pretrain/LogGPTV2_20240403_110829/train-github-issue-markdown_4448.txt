Hi,
On a test website (http://ks3364357.kimsufi.com/) I have a navbar with a menu
and a button. Both are right aligned. It works well in firefox but the
behaviour in chrome is very strange.
First time you go on the page the button break from the line makin the navbar
bigger. But if you resize it (til it gets in navbar-collapse mode) then go
back to normal, the button is right where it belongs.
Here is the code :
                Toggle navigation
              Friendly Monthly
                Curated Newsletter
