User: Cassandra works in cluster model with 3 nodes.When all nodes are "UP", I use cql “select * from User” in cqlsh，Cassandra returns the right result.But after a node is dead,when I use "select" again,no result returns but reports:"Unable to complete request: one or more nodes were unavailable" .
I turned to use cassandra-cli command:"get Users", it returns me the right data without any error.
any ideas?
Assistant: What was the replication factor that you used for the keyspace? 
How many rows of data does the "users" column family have? 

I found myself in a similar situation (yesterday) with replication factor set to 1 and "users" column family having only one row. 
Cluster Information: 
3 nodes on AWS
Same datacenter name
Keyspace name: rf1
SimpleStrategy
Replication factor 1
Column Family name: users
Querying using cqlsh, default consistency
Scenario 1: 
One or two nodes in the cluster were down
I found that the query "select * from users" would return "Unable to complete request: one or more nodes were unavailable" if any of the 3 nodes was down. 
Scenario 2: 
Node 1 was down. 
Node 2 was down. 
Node 3 was up. 
The query "select * from users where user_name='abhishek'" would return me the row. 
I figured this was the case because the row seemed to be on node 3. 
My understanding of the scenario: 
When you make the query "select * from users", you are asking Cassandra to return all the rows from the column family. It would not be able to do so since one or more nodes are down and it cannot give you the whole column family since there might be some rows on the nodes that were down. 
But the query with the where clause would return the row because it was available on node 3 and node 3 was up. 
Does that make sense? 
One flaw with this explanation is that I would expect Cassandra to return all the rows that are AVAILABLE in the cluster with "select * from users"
I am going to do some more digging now and will update if I find anything useful.
