User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Very High Apache CPU On Simple Processes My Apache server is at a standstill with connections maxed out and CPU usage at 500%. It has been working fine for months but something today made it go weird. Very very simple Apache processes are taking up large amounts of CPU:

As you can see, simple ..reading.. and requests like GET /images/soc.png HTTP/1.1 are taking up 24.5+ amounts of CPU. I am wondering if it is some sort of logging bug where the server is trying to handle huge log files. Let me know what you guys think about this.

Assistant: The sample you proceed was small but I have seen similar things before.  it might not actually be the web server that's the problem,   take look further upstream to something like the database.   Is the DB reached max-connections or taking flogging?

if you have a lot of processes caught in send reply state you can see similar symptoms such as this..   

&gt; 0-0 31154   0/1/1   W   0.07    119 0   0.0 0.00    0.00   
&gt; 117.102.163.190 mysite.net  POST    /includes/offers/ajax.php   HTTP/1.1


note the Seconds since beginning of most recent request (SS) times are high on your "send reply state" (W).
