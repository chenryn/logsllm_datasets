User: How to use iptables to set the network security policy of Linux server?
Assistant: iptables is a very powerful tool on Linux servers, which can be used to manage network traffic, filter and forward data packets, set network security policies, etc. Here are some steps to set up a Linux server network security policy: 1. Check the default rules: Use the `iptables -L` command to list the existing rules and view the default policy of the corresponding chain. 2. Prohibit all traffic: Use `iptables -P INPUT DROP`, `iptables -P FORWARD DROP`, `iptables -P OUTPUT DROP` commands to prohibit all input, forwarding and output traffic respectively. 3. Allow necessary traffic: According to the needs of server applications, we need to set some necessary traffic, such as SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, etc. You can use the following command: ```bash iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT # Allow SSH connection iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT # Allow HTTP connection iptables -A INPUT - p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT # Allow HTTPS connection``` 4. Prevent malicious traffic: In order to prevent traffic from malicious attackers, we can set some rules to filter these traffic. For example: ```bash # Prevent SYN Flood attack iptables -A INPUT -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j DROP # Prevent Ping attack iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo- request -m limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP ``` 5. Ban some dangerous network protocols: you can use the following command to ban some Dangerous network protocols such as ICMP, IGMP, ICMPv6, etc. ```bash iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP #Prohibit ICMP protocol iptables -A INPUT -p igmp -j DROP #Prohibit IGMP protocol iptables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -j DROP #Prohibit ICMPv6 protocol``` 6 . Save settings: use the following command to save the settings to the firewall configuration file, so that it will continue to take effect after restarting the server. ```bash service iptables save ``` The above are some common methods of setting up Linux server network security policies. It should be noted that when setting iptables rules, it is necessary to plan and design according to the actual situation to ensure network security and normal operation of the server.
