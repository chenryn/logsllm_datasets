User: Lets say for batch processing of over 10000 videos, is there any thing to be gained from using FFmpeg rather than the pyFFmpeg?
Assistant: Considering that pyFFmpeg is just a wrapper over the libraries, I'd say you shouldn't have any negligible performance difference between the 2, since they use the same libraries at the core.
