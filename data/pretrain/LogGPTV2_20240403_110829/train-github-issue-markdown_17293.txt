##### SUMMARY
When multiple roles are pulled into a playbook, earlier roles can reference
default variables from later roles, i.e., variables can be used before they
are defined.  
Even after scouring the documentation I can only conclude that this is
surprising behaviour.  
It has been stated elsewhere that defaults belong to the global scope. But
this issue is tangential. It refers to ordering of roles when it comes to
defaults.
This is a duplicate of #13814 which has never been solved.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
The example https://github.com/mrdrogdrog/ansible-var-default contains two
roles which just print a var to debug output.  
The role `first` hasn't a default definition.  
The role `second` sets the default value of `var` to "second"
Playbook:
    ---
    - hosts: local
      roles:
        - role: first
        - role: second
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
The playbook shouldn't compile because `first` expects a value for `var` which
is not set.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
The playbook compiles and prints
    second
    second
to debug output
