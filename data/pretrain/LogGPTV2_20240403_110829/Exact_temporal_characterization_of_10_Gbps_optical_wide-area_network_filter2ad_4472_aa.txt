## Abstract
We design and implement a novel class of highly precise network instrumentation and apply this tool to perform the first exact packet-timing measurements of a wide-area network (WAN) ever undertaken, capturing 10 Gigabit Ethernet packets in flight on optical fiber. Through principled design, we improve timing precision by two to six orders of magnitude over existing techniques. Our observations challenge several common assumptions about the behavior of WANs and the relationship between their input and output traffic flows. Additionally, we identify and characterize emergent packet chains as a mechanism to explain previously observed anomalous packet loss on receiver endpoints of such networks.

## 1. Introduction
In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art in Internet measurement by presenting the design, implementation, and application of a novel form of precise instrumentation—BiFocals—that allows for the exact characterization of network traffic in flight. In addition to introducing our methodology, we employ BiFocals to empirically characterize a specific wide-area network path: a 15,000 km static route across the 10 Gbps National LambdaRail optical backbone. Our focus is on inter-packet timings, a fundamental metric of traffic flows from which many secondary characteristics can be derived (jitter, link capacity, etc.). Inter-packet timings are also independently important as a practical metric.

Our measurements of the National LambdaRail (NLR) shed light on the puzzling phenomenon of anomalous WAN packet loss that we recently observed. Even at low to moderate data rates, WANs can provoke endpoint receiver packet loss, although the same endpoint can service such data rates within a local-area network. As we show, when a flow traverses a WAN, routers perturb inter-packet spacing to such an extent that, within a few hops, a flow with large, fixed inter-packet spacing degenerates into a series of packet chains. This phenomenon occurs even in a lightly loaded WAN, irrespective of input data rate.

Internet traffic has already been shown to be bursty. However, the prevailing assumption is that sufficient burstiness to cause packet loss does not arise in networks with ample excess bandwidth. Our study reveals that this is not true: an input flow with homogeneously distributed packets in time becomes increasingly perturbed, transforming the egress flow into a series of minimally spaced packet chains. For example, an ideal inflow with a constant data rate of 1 Gbps can degenerate into an extremely bursty outflow with data rates surging to 10 Gbps for short periods, triggering packet loss even in core network routers and overwhelming endpoints.

This matters for several reasons:
1. Many protocol and application research projects implicitly assume that it makes sense to measure networks using software running on end-hosts. Our work provides "ground truth" properties of the WAN, challenging this notion and demonstrating that previous timing characterizations could be susceptible to distortions on end-host receivers.
2. Protocols often assume that if a flow enters the network satisfying some profile or property, and background traffic along the network path is low, it will emerge downstream with bounded properties. Our work shows that even if a conditioned flow were in profile at the point of ingress, within a few hops, it may be far outside the negotiated parameters. Additionally, some congestion-detection schemes look at inter-packet spacing as a signal of congestion; our work clarifies that micro-bursts can develop even in a mostly idle network.

In summary, this work contributes to the science of network measurement in the following ways:
- **Instrumentation**: We design and implement novel high-precision instrumentation, BiFocals, to enable the generation, capture, and analysis of extremely precise traffic flows. We use physics-laboratory test equipment (oscilloscopes, frequency synthesizers, lasers, etc.) to generate and acquire analog traces directly off optical fiber, avoiding non-determinism and systemic noise. This results in a six-order-of-magnitude improvement in timing precision over existing end-host software and a two to three orders-of-magnitude improvement over prior hardware-assisted solutions.
- **Measurements**: We apply BiFocals to exactly characterize the delay distribution of network traffic after transit across two paths: a single isolated router and a deployed, but lightly used, 10 Gbps WAN path across eleven enterprise routers and 15,000 km of optical fiber. These measurements are computationally intensive, requiring over two trillion individual samples and over 5,000 processor-hours of offline computation.
- **Observations**: We observe that as a flow traverses a long sequence of routers, packets cluster into chains, irrespective of data rate. This finding clarifies previously unexplained observations of packet loss on WAN endpoints and calls into question some basic premises of WAN paths. We also characterize the stability of such packet chains and their probability as a function of their length.
- **Outlook**: We provide support for the view that only high-fidelity experimental work can provide ground truth and answer contentious questions about network behavior.

## 2. Motivation
To exactly measure timing in network packet flows, BiFocals departs substantially from existing techniques. This section presents a taxonomy of different approaches to measurement, of increasing precision, and motivates the resulting architectural decisions that inform our design of BiFocals.

### 2.1 Physical Layer Background
In a commodity end-host computer, the Ethernet controller of a typical 10GBase-R network adapter accepts Ethernet packets from higher layers of the network stack in the kernel and prepares them for transmission across the physical medium of the optical fiber span. However, the network adapter does not transmit individual Ethernet packets across the network but instead embeds the data bitstream of discrete network packets within a continuously transmitted symbolstream. The continuous characteristic of this symbolstream, along with the application of complex line-coding protocols and scrambling functions, provides critical guarantees for the proper performance of the transmission line.

The crucial point here is that while the higher-layer data bitstream involves discrete Ethernet packets, the lower-layer symbolstream is continuous. Every symbol is the same width in time (∼100 picoseconds) and is transmitted at the precisely identical symbol rate (∼10 GBaud), completely irrespective of the data rate of the actual network traffic.

Figure 2 depicts a comparison between the Physical Layer symbolstream and two hypothetical data bitstreams, motivating the likely loss of timing precision in the bitstreams. The top panel shows the actual symbolstream as transmitted on fiber, with its continuous flow of symbols of equal width at equal rate. The remaining panels demonstrate the absence of a continuous timebase once the Ethernet packets have been extracted.

### 2.2 Measurement Taxonomy
- **User-space software packet stamping**: This approach involves recording the arrival time of each packet in user space. While simple, it suffers from significant non-determinism due to kernel scheduling and memory bus contention.
- **Kernel interrupt-handler stamping**: This method records the arrival of each packet using a kernel interrupt handler. It removes ambiguities involved with kernel scheduling but still suffers from the non-determinism of the asynchronous interrupt-delivery mechanism.
- **Network-adapter bitstream stamping**: Specialized network adapters (often custom FPGAs) are used to enable packet time-stamping functionality in the network card hardware. These designs aim to stamp the packets as early in their processing as possible but must first extract individual packets from the underlying Physical Layer symbolstream, leading to potential timing errors.
- **On-fiber symbolstream stamping (BiFocals)**: Our BiFocals instrumentation represents a substantial departure from the above techniques. By excluding the end-host completely and directly tapping the fiber transport, we record a contiguous portion of the entire Physical Layer symbolstream in real-time. Only later, in offline post-processing, do we extract the discrete Ethernet packets from this captured trace and assign time-stamps in relation to the symbolstream timebase. This approach ensures exact timestamps, agnostic to the data rate of the network traffic.
