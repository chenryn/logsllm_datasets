  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate, although #8580 is certainly related and could be the same root cause.
## Expected Behavior
Am able to use withTheme in my React 16 application
## Current Behavior
When using withTheme from PI:EMAIL with React 16, React gives
the following warning, which is fatal to the execution of my app.
Warning: Functions are not valid as a React child. This may happen if you
return a Component instead of from render. Or maybe you meant to call this
function rather than return it.
## Steps to Reproduce
Here is an example of how I am using withTheme:
const MyComponent = props => {  
// use props.theme.palette.text.primary  
};  
export default withTheme(MyComponent);
## Environment
Issue did not exist when using withTheme with React 15. Issue occurs post-
upgrade of React.
