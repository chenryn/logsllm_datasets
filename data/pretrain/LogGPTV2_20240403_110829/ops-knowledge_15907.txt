User: I am using py2exe to compiling python scripts in executable files on Windows Xp/7/2000.
I am wondering if such executable scripts could freeze the operating system, and I have to reboot Windows.
I suppose such problems could occur if I try to manage driver library.
What do you think about?
Assistant: A Python program - regardless of whether iterpreted by the Python executable or in py2exe form - can do the same as any other program. That means that it should not be able to freeze a modern operating system unless it is run with superuser rights. However, programs (especially malicious and badly written ones) can significantly degrade user experience, for example by going fullscreen and refusing to show the desktop or starting lots of threads and processes.
