## Environment & Settings
- **Celery version**: 5.2.7 (dawn-chorus)
- **`celery report` Output**:
  ```
  $ celery report
  software -> celery:5.2.7 (dawn-chorus) kombu:5.2.4 py:3.9.9
              billiard:3.6.4.0 py-amqp:5.1.1
  platform -> system:Darwin arch:64bit
              kernel version:21.4.0 imp:CPython
  loader   -> celery.loaders.default.Loader
  settings -> transport:amqp results:disabled
  deprecated_settings: None
  ```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. In the `tasks.py` file, declare a task with serialization set to `pickle`.
   ```python
   from celery import shared_task

   @shared_task(serializer='pickle')
   def pickle_serializable_args_task(nice_set):
       print('Starting Task')
       sleep(200)  # Simulate a long-running task
       print('Task Finished')
   ```

2. Open a Django shell and run the following commands:
   ```python
   from myapp.apps.niceapp.tasks import pickle_serializable_args_task
   task = pickle_serializable_args_task.delay(set([1, 2, 3]))
   celery_hostname = 'celery@work'  # Update hostname as per your configuration
   celery_inspect = task.app.control.inspect([celery_hostname])
   celery_inspect.active()
   ```

   Running `celery_inspect.active()` will throw the following error:
   ```
