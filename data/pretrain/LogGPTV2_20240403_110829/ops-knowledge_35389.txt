User: I'm just starting to learn Python and did search around a little, so forgive me if this has been asked and answered.
When running scripts through the command line/terminal, I have to type "python3" to run the latest version of Python. With Python 2.X I just use "python". 
Is there a way to run Python 3 just using "python"? 
It may seem a little lazy, but I'm mostly just curious if it is possible or if it will break anything unnecessarily if I could in fact do it.
Assistant: on raspbian linux in the terminal i just run it by typing python3 file.py or just python file.py for python 2
