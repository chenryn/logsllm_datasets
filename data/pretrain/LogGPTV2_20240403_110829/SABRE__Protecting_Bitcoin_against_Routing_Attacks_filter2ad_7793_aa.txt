## Abstract
Internet routing attacks remain a practical threat as existing countermeasures either fail to provide robust protection or are not easily deployable. Blockchain systems, particularly Bitcoin, are vulnerable to such attacks due to their reliance on global communication for consensus. BGP hijacking can potentially split the Bitcoin network in half.

In this paper, we introduce SABRE, a secure and scalable Bitcoin relay network designed to resist routing attacks. SABRE operates alongside the existing peer-to-peer network and is easily deployable. As a critical system, SABRE is highly resilient and can efficiently handle high bandwidth loads, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

SABRE's design is based on two key insights:
1. **Leveraging Inter-Domain Routing Policies:** We host relay nodes in networks that are inherently protected against routing attacks and on paths preferred by most Bitcoin clients.
2. **Communication-Heavy Operations:** Relaying blocks is communication-intensive rather than computation-intensive. This allows us to offload most operations to programmable network hardware using the P4 programming language, ensuring seamless operation under high load and mitigating the effects of malicious clients.

We present a complete implementation of SABRE and an extensive evaluation. Our results show that SABRE effectively secures Bitcoin against routing attacks, even with as few as six nodes.

## 1. Introduction
Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are vulnerable to routing attacks where network-level attackers (malicious Autonomous Systems or ASes) manipulate BGP advertisements to divert connections. Once on-path, the attacker can disrupt the consensus algorithm by partitioning the peer-to-peer network. Recent studies have shown that these attacks are practical and disruptive, allowing any AS-level attacker to isolate approximately 50% of Bitcoin mining power by hijacking fewer than 100 prefixes. Such attacks can lead to significant revenue loss for miners and enable exploits like double spending.

### 1.1 Problem
Protecting against such partitioning attacks is challenging. Local and easily deployable countermeasures, such as monitoring connections or selecting peers based on routing information, fail to provide strong protection. Internet-wide countermeasures, like hosting Bitcoin clients in /24 prefixes, are extremely difficult to deploy and may not be sufficient. Even encrypting all Bitcoin traffic would not guarantee safety as AS-level attackers could still distinguish and drop Bitcoin traffic using transport headers.

### 1.2 SABRE: A Secure Relay Network for Bitcoin
In this paper, we present SABRE, a secure relay network that runs alongside the existing Bitcoin network and protects the majority of Bitcoin clients against routing attacks. Unlike existing countermeasures, SABRE provides strong security guarantees, is partially deployable, and offers early benefits with as few as two relay nodes. SABRE is built on two key insights:

#### Insight #1: Hosting Relays in Inherently Safe Locations
We host SABRE relay nodes in locations that:
- Prevent attackers from diverting relay-to-relay connections, securing SABRE's internal connectivity.
- Are attractive from a routing perspective to many Bitcoin clients, protecting client connections to the relay network.

We leverage a fundamental characteristic of BGP policies: connections established between two ASes that directly peer with each other and have no customers cannot be diverted by routing attacks. Using real routing data, we show that 2,000 ASes are eligible, including large cloud providers, content delivery networks, and Internet eXchange Points. Deployments with six nodes can protect 80% of clients from 96% of AS-level adversaries.

#### Insight #2: Resiliency through Software-Hardware Co-Design
As a publicly-facing and transparent network, SABRE is a target for DDoS attacks. To mitigate this, we leverage the fact that relaying blocks is communication-heavy, not computation-heavy. The content (blocks) to propagate is predictable and small. These properties allow us to offload most SABRE operations to programmable network hardware using P4, enabling SABRE nodes to sustain up to Tbps of load.

### 1.3 Contributions
Our main contributions are:
- **Security Against AS-Level Adversaries:** SABRE prevents AS-level adversaries from partitioning the Bitcoin network.
- **Node Positioning Algorithm:** An algorithm for positioning SABRE nodes in selected ASes to minimize the chances of successful routing attacks.
- **Software-Hardware Co-Design:** A novel co-design for SABRE relay nodes to operate seamlessly under high load.
- **Measurement Study:** A study showing SABRE's effectiveness in protecting Bitcoin clients and the limitations of existing relay networks.
- **Complete Implementation:** A full implementation of SABRE, including P4 code for programmable network switches and an extended Bitcoin client.
- **Incentive Analysis:** An analysis of the incentives for candidate ASes to host SABRE nodes.

While SABRE focuses on Bitcoin, its design principles can be applied to protect other blockchain systems from routing attacks.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
The Internet consists of over 60,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes), which use BGP to exchange information about reaching 700,000+ IP prefixes. Each AS originates one or more IP prefixes, which are propagated AS-by-AS.

#### Policies
BGP is a single-path, policy-based protocol. Each AS selects the best route to reach any IP prefix and selectively exports it to neighboring ASes. Route selection and exportation are governed by business relationships, primarily customer-provider and peer-peer. In a customer-provider relationship, the customer pays the provider for full Internet connectivity. In a peer-peer relationship, ASes connect to transfer traffic between their respective customers and internal users.

#### Hijacks
BGP routers do not validate route advertisements, making them vulnerable to BGP hijacks. Malicious ASes can create fake advertisements, redirecting traffic to given destinations. Two types of hijacks exist: more-specific (longer) prefix hijacks and existing (equally specific) prefix hijacks. More-specific hijacks attract all traffic addressed to the more-specific prefix, while existing prefix hijacks compete with legitimate announcements, and the amount of diverted traffic depends on the relative positions of the attacker and the victim.

### 2.2 Bitcoin and Relay Networks
Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network for block propagation. Relay networks, such as Falcon, FIBRE, and the Fast Relay Network (FRN), aim to speed up block propagation by using high-speed relay nodes and advanced routing techniques. By connecting to these relays, Bitcoin clients can alleviate the effects of poor network performance.

## 3. SABRE: A Secure Relay Network for Bitcoin
SABRE is a transparent relay network that protects Bitcoin clients from routing attacks by providing a secure channel for learning and propagating the latest mined blocks. The IP addresses of SABRE relay nodes are publicly known, and any Bitcoin client can connect to them. To benefit from SABRE, a client needs to establish a connection to at least one relay node.

To achieve its goals, SABRE must remain connected at all times, even under arbitrary BGP advertisements or extremely high load. SABRE leverages two key insights to ensure continuous operation:
- **Smart Node Placement:** Hosting relay nodes in inherently safe locations.
- **Efficient Load Handling:** Offloading communication-heavy operations to programmable network hardware.

These insights make SABRE a robust and scalable solution for protecting Bitcoin against routing attacks.
