User:  How to monitor the status and performance of large-scale distributed systems?
Assistant: To monitor the status and performance of large-scale distributed systems, certain monitoring solutions and tools are required. The following are some common methods and tools: 1. Collect and store data: Collectors need to be installed in the system to collect system status and performance data and store them in the database. 2. Visual display: monitoring data can be displayed by drawing charts, tables, etc., so that administrators and developers can better understand the operating status of the system. 3. Email/SMS/telephone alarm: When the system is abnormal, the monitoring system should be able to automatically alarm, including sending emails, text messages, and telephone calls, so that users can deal with problems in a timely manner. 4. Log analysis: By collecting and analyzing system logs, you can quickly locate problems and adjust and optimize the system. 5. Distributed tracing: It is used to trace the request process in a distributed system, and can find performance bottlenecks and errors in the system. 6. Performance test: test the performance of the system by simulating load, etc., so as to understand the capacity and limitations of the system. 7. Automated operation and maintenance: Through automated tools and scripts, some common operation and maintenance tasks, such as backup and cleaning, can be automatically completed, allowing administrators to manage the system more efficiently. Commonly used monitoring tools include: Nagios, Zabbix, Ganglia, Prometheus, Rizhiyi, etc.
