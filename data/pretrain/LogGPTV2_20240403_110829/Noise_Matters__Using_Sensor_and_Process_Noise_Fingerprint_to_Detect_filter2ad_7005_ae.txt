checked only against its own profile and not with all the rest of the
sensors. However since we do not have an attacker’s spoofed data
beforehand, it is not possible to train a classifier for the illegitimate
class. Therefore, data from all the rest of the sensors is considered
an “other class”. Later we also used one-class SVM to train only for
“legitimate class” for each sensor and then tested the performance
under various attacks. These observations mean that the proposed
technique will scale well even if the number of sensors is huge as it
is not necessary to compare a sensor’s fingerprint with the whole
population. The experiments are performed on a water treatment
testbed which has different types and models of sensors. Also, there
are 6 stages in the process plant with different process dynamics,
which points to the generality of the proposed technique.
Limitation (False Alarm Rate): For any intrusion detection sys-
tem, false alarms are a limiting factor. In Table 5, it can be seen
that using one-class SVM helps to detect attacks with higher accu-
racy (TPR) but at the cost of slightly lower TNR (i.e. misclassifying
normal operation as under attack). Since the lowest TNR is 86%,
we can come up with a heuristic threshold of 85% to raise an alarm
for an attack. This would significantly lower the false alarm rate.
We are also experimenting with a moving average window filter
to lower the false alarm rate by tuning the detector parameters on
live water treatment testbed.
Performance Comparison with Reference Techniques: Attacks
studied in this article are a set of benchmark attacks used by others
too [1, 10]. The list in Table 6 shows executed attacks performed
on sensors or on a sensor-actuator pair. Accuracy results in Table 6
can be directly compared (for each exact attack sequence) with
results in [10]. We observe that our proposed technique performs
better but it would not be a fair comparison without pointing out
the downside of our proposed technique i.e. false alarms. However,
authors in [10] do not provide false alarms in case of an attacked
dataset (meaning even for attack dataset, attacks were executed
from time to time and most of the readings are normal, therefore
one should also provide accuracy for normal data classification).
In [1] the detection metrics are not attack detection accuracy but
an alarm for the case of an attack. Therefore, from Table 6 it can
be seen that the proposed technique performs similarly by success-
fully detecting attacks on sensors, and also does not require design
information (which is required by the method in [1]) to come up
with physical invariants.
Implementation and Practical Considerations:
Sensor Replacement/Retraining: Since fingerprints are specific
to each sensor, a question arises about what would happen to a
fingerprint if a sensor is replaced? In an occasion when a sensor is
replaced for whatever reason, the proposed technique does not need
to create a new system model because the system dynamics are still
the same. We only need to figure out the noise component being
contributed by sensor’s hardware. To accomplish this objective we
just need to run the system and collect data and update profile only
for the newly added sensor. It does not require to generate a new
system model but just training data for machine learning methods.
Training Phase (Capturing System Dynamics): To be a rep-
resentative system model, one should capture the whole process
dynamics. For example, in the case of a water treatment testbed, a
complete cycle of process is involved starting from raw water to
filtration stages until we obtain clean drinking water.
6 RELATED WORK
Device fingerprinting is not a new idea on its own but creating new
fingerprints for devices in a CPS is less explored. Device finger-
printing for CPS-devices poses unique challenges due to different
technologies as compared to IT infrastructures and also encounters
different threat models. Previous research efforts focused on threats
including privacy compromise or tracking of a certain device. In this
work, it is proposed to authenticate the sensors and also to detect
attacks in a CPS setting. This work is a continuation of our earlier
proposal [5] to create unique fingerprints for sensing devices in a
CPS and demonstrating their effectiveness against a range of strong
attack scenarios. A summary of the related work is as follows.
Device Fingerprinting: Camera identification based on a CMOS
sensor is presented in [25] and it became an inspiration for our work.
In [25], a reference noise pattern for each camera is extracted and
576ACSAC ’18, December 3–7, 2018, San Juan, PR, USA

later used for camera attribution. A remote device identification
based on microscopic deviations in the device’s clock [29, 34] is
presented in [21]. In [37] network traffic analysis is carried out to
fingerprint the device and device-type based on wireless network
traffic. In [12], fingerprints for RFID smart cards are created by
analyzing the modulation scheme and features derived from that
analysis.
CPS Device Fingerprinting and Attack Detection: Among attack
detection techniques in the context of CPS, a few of the related
works have used the same testbed (SWaT) for experiments. We have
used the same testbed and the same dataset as presented in [1, 10].
Both of those techniques use physical invariants to detect attacks.
The proposed technique is different from those as we only consider
device/sensor characteristics and do not necessarily care about
the whole system state. Also, our proposed technique does not
need source code or the control system design of a process plant
and it does not need to come up with invariants which is a tedious
procedure on its own. Another related work is [23] in which authors
monitor the variations in process variables to detect attacks. It is
related to our work considering that both study process dynamics
but a direct comparison of the performance of detection cannot
be made because of the principle of detection techniques as well
as executed attacks. Authors in [23] used an information theoretic
approach (Shannon entropy on sensor data) as a detection method
and it is not clear if the proposed method would be effective for the
stealthy attacks considered in our work. There are a few research
works on the fingerprinting of CPS devices. One approach [15] uses
network traffic analysis and physical operation timings of a device.
Experiments are performed on 2 latching relays. However, that
approach cannot be applied to sensing devices studied in our work
because there is no mechanical motion of the components as was
the case for electric relays in [15]. Another study in the context of
CPS device fingerprinting is carried out on SWaT testbed based on
Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprints of wireless access points
connected to PLCs [35]. A related work proposed [30] to fingerprint
sensors based on their noise. However, the method works only in
specific states, for example, if the water in the tank has a constant
level. To extract sensor noise for certain sensors (e.g. level sensors),
one needs to wait for the process to be static. However, the process
is not static most of the times and thus introduces another source
of noise termed the process noise. The novelty in our proposed
approach is that it does not depend on the specific state of a system
and that it uses dynamics of the process to create a system model.
It combines sensor and process noise to create a fingerprint which
is a novel idea.
7 CONCLUSIONS
A technique to fingerprint the sensor and process noise is presented.
It is shown that such a fingerprint can uniquely identify the sensor
by looking at the sensor measurements passively. The upper bounds
for state deviation under a stealthy attack are derived. Results have
shown that sensors can be identified with as high an accuracy
of 98% by using the noise fingerprint. A multitude of attacks on
sensor measurements are detected with a high true positive and
true negative rate. A security argument against stealthy attacks is
provided. It is shown that the proposed technique is able to detect
a strong adversary. Future Work: The goal is to achieve higher
accuracy for attack detection and a very low false alarm rate. An
idea is to come up with heuristics such as a voting system among
physically coupled sensors and to improve the system model by
using a bank of observers scheme.
