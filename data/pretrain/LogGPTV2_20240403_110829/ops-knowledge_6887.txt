User:  What are the layers of the network OSI, and what is the meaning of each layer?
Assistant: Network OSI is divided into 7 layers, namely physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer and application layer. 1. Physical Layer: The physical layer transmits data frames on the local area network, and it is responsible for managing the intercommunication between computer communication equipment and network media. 2. Data Link Layer (Data Link Layer): Assembly and analysis of data packets, error detection and correction, data flow control and link management. 3. Network Layer (Network Layer): Realize routing and forwarding of data packets, congestion control and network interconnection. 4. Transport Layer: Provides end-to-end reliable data transmission, including functions such as data segmentation, flow control, and error recovery. 5. Session Layer (Session Layer): Establish, manage and terminate session connections between applications. 6. Presentation Layer: data format conversion, encryption and decryption, compression and decompression, and other processing. 7. Application Layer (Application Layer): direct-to-user applications, such as email, file transfer, remote login, etc.
