in py3, the following should correctly raise an `IndexError`
    In [1]: s = Series(range(5),index=list('aacde'))
    In [2]: s[5]
    IndexError
however  
a positional indexer that is in the range should work  
`s[3]`
Further more, this must be a monotonic increasing duplicated index to trigger
    In [8]: Series(range(5),index=list('aabcd'))[3]
    IndexError: 3
    In [9]: Series(range(5),index=list('aadcb'))[3]
    Out[9]: 3
simple change needed here  
in that if its an integer and in the range of the index it can return that
value.
Though _maybe_ we should just detect this in the cython code
(`index.pyx/Index/_get_loc_duplicated`)
needless to say, no tests for this :<
