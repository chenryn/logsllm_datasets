Researchers have observed that users, particularly in the US and UK, tend to choose passwords that can be easily derived from dictionary words. A study using a dictionary of 62,727 words was able to crack 24% of the collected accounts, with 52% of the cracked passwords being shorter than six characters. In 2004, Yan et al. [62] found that users often select dictionary words as passwords due to the difficulty in memorizing random strings. Their user study, involving 288 participants, showed an average password length of 7-8 characters.

In 2012, Bonneau [7] conducted a comprehensive analysis of 70 million Yahoo private passwords, examining various subpopulations based on demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, and language) and site usage characteristics (e.g., email and retail). The study revealed that even seemingly distinct language communities often choose the same weak passwords. This research was later replicated by [3] using differential privacy techniques. Notably, Chinese passwords were found to be among the most difficult to crack [7].

However, in 2014, Li et al. [34] argued that Bonneauâ€™s dataset may not be representative of general Chinese users, as Yahoo users are typically more familiar with English. Li et al. used five datasets from Chinese websites and observed that Chinese users prefer to use digits in their passwords, whereas English-speaking users tend to use letters. Nonetheless, two of the Chinese datasets used by Li et al. were not properly cleaned, potentially leading to inaccurate measures and biased comparisons. Additionally, several critical password properties, such as length distributions, frequency distributions, and semantics, remain underexplored.

In 2014, Ma et al. [36] investigated the length and structure of passwords in six datasets, three of which were from Chinese websites. While this work focused on the effectiveness of probabilistic password cracking models, it did not delve into deeper semantic aspects, such as the role of Pinyins, names, or dates. In 2017, Pearman et al. [42] conducted an in situ examination of 4,057 passwords from 154 English-speaking users over an average of 147 days. They found that the average password consists of 2.77 character classes and is 9.92 characters long, including 5.91 lowercase letters, 2.70 digits, 0.84 uppercase letters, and 0.46 symbols.

Regarding semantic patterns, Riddle et al. [43] in 1989 discovered that birth dates, personal names, nicknames, and celebrity names are frequently used in passwords. In 2004, Brown et al. [9] confirmed this through a survey involving 218 participants and 1,783 passwords, reporting that the most frequent entity in passwords is the self (67%), followed by relatives (7%) and lovers or friends. Names (32%) were the most common information used, followed by dates (7%). Veras et al. [51] analyzed the 32 million RockYou dataset using visualization techniques and found that 15% of passwords contain sequences of 5-8 consecutive digits, 38% of which could be classified as dates. They also noted that repeated days/months and holidays are popular, and when non-digits are paired with dates, they are most commonly single characters or month names.

In 2014, Li et al. [34] demonstrated that Chinese users often incorporate Pinyins and dates into their passwords. However, many other important semantic patterns, such as Pinyin names and mobile numbers, remain unexplored. Our study improves upon the data cleaning processes (see Section 3.2) and the tuning of cracking algorithms (see Section 4.1) to provide a more accurate measure of the strength of Chinese passwords.
