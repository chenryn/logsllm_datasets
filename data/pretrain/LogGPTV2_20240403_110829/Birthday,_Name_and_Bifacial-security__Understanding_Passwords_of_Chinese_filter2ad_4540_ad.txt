er accounts from his friends and acquaintances around
US and UK. They observed that users tend to choose
passwords that can be easily derived from dictionary
words: a dictionary of 62,727 words is able to crack 24%
of the collected accounts and 52% of the cracked pass-
words are shorter than 6 characters long. In 2004, Yan et
al. [62] found that passwords are likely to be dictionary
words since users have difﬁculty in memorizing random
strings. On average, the password length in their user
study (288 participants) is 7∼8.
In 2012, Bonneau [7] conducted a systematic analysis
of 70 million Yahoo private passwords. This work
examined dozens of subpopulations based on demo-
graphic factors (e.g., age, gender, and language) and
site usage characteristics (e.g., email and retail). They
found that even seemingly distant language communities
choose the same weak passwords. This research was
recently reproduced in [3] by using differential privacy
techniques. Particularly, Chinese passwords are found
among the most difﬁcult ones to crack [7]. In 2014, how-
ever, Li et al. [34] argued that Bonneau’s dataset is not
representative of general Chinese users, because Yahoo
users are familiar with English. Accordingly, Li et al.
leveraged a corpus of ﬁve datasets from Chinese sites and
observed that Chinese users like to use digits when cre-
ating passwords, as compared to English speaking users
who like to use letters to create passwords. However, as
an elementary defect, two of their Chinese datasets have
not been cleaned properly (see Section 3.2), which might
lead to inaccurate measures and biased comparisons.
More importantly, several critical password properties
(such as length distributions, frequency distributions and
semantics) remain to be explored.
In 2014, Ma et al. [36] investigated password charac-
teristics about the length and the structure of six datasets,
three of which are from Chinese websites. Nonethe-
less, this work mainly focuses on the effectiveness of
probabilistic password cracking models and pays little
attention to the deeper semantics (e.g., no information is
provided about the role of Pinyins, names or dates). In
2017, Pearman et al. [42] reported on an in situ examina-
tion of 4057 passwords from 154 English-speaking users
over an average of 147 days. They found that the average
password is composed of 2.77 character classes and is of
length 9.92 characters, including 5.91 lowercase letters,
2.70 digits, 0.84 uppercase letters, and 0.46 symbols.
Semantic patterns.
In 1989, Riddle et al. [43] found
that birth dates, personal names, nicknames and celebrity
names are popular in user-generated passwords.
In
2004, Brown et al. [9] conﬁrmed this by conducting a
thorough survey that involved 218 participants and 1,783
passwords. They reported that the most frequent entity
in passwords is the self (67%), followed by relatives
(7%), lovers and friends; Also, names (32%) were found
to be the most common information used, followed
by dates (7%). Veras et al. [51] examined the 32M
RockYou dataset by employing visualization techniques
and observed that 15% of passwords contain sequences
of 5∼8 consecutive digits, 38% of which could be fur-
ther classiﬁed as dates. They also found that repeated
days/months and holidays are popular, and when non-
digits are paired with dates, they are most commonly
single-characters or names of months.
In 2014, Li et al. [34] showed that Chinese users
tend to insert Pinyins and dates into their passwords.
However, many other important semantic patterns (e.g.,
Pinyin name and mobile number) are left unexplored. In
addition, we improve upon the processes of data cleaning
(see Sec. 3.2) and tuning of cracking algorithms (see
Sec. 4.1) to advance beyond Li et al.’s measurement
of the strength of Chinese passwords. In 2015, Ji et al.
