## Checklist
  * I have included the output of `celery -A proj report` in the issue.  
(if you are not able to do this, then at least specify the Celery  
version affected).
  * I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.
## Steps to reproduce
I'm using django 1.8 + Celery 4.0.1 + Kombu 4.0.1 + Redis as broker
from kombu.common import Broadcast  
CELERY_QUEUE_BROADCAST = 'broadcast'  
CELERY_QUEUES = (Broadcast(queue=CELERY_QUEUE_BROADCAST), )
@task(ignore_result=True, queue=CELERY_QUEUE_BROADCAST)  
def broadcast_task():  
print "task runned"
started two workers  
celery -A proj worker -Q broadcast
broadcast_task.delay()
## Expected behavior
tasks are performed by each worker at same time
## Actual behavior
tasks performed by one worker at same time
