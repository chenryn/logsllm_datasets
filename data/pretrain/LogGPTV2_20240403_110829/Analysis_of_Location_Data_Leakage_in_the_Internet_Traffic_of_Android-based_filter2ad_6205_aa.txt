## Abstract

In recent years, there has been a shift towards personalized, context-based services for mobile devices. A key component of these services is the ability to infer the current and future location of users based on embedded location sensors. This knowledge enables service providers to offer relevant and timely services, enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement. However, such services are often marred by location data leakage, which has become a significant privacy concern for smartphone users. This paper specifically examines location data exposed by Android applications via internet traffic in plaintext without user awareness. We present an empirical evaluation of real mobile device users' network traffic aimed at: (1) measuring the extent of location data leakage; (2) understanding the value of this data and the ability to infer users’ points of interest (POIs); and (3) deriving a step-by-step attack to infer POIs under realistic assumptions. Our analysis involved 71 participants over an average period of 37 days. We propose a method for mining and filtering location data from raw network traffic and use geolocation clustering to infer POIs. Key findings indicate that over 85% of users' devices leaked location data, and the exposure rate of POIs derived from sparse leakage indicators is around 61%.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, personalization of services has become a trend, especially in the context of mobile devices. Millions of people use context-based applications daily, such as Yelp, Uber, and Google Maps. These devices store a wealth of private information, including personal, financial, and location data, making them targets for personalized advertisements and intelligence gathering. A critical feature of many services is the ability to determine the user's current location, infer points of interest (POIs), and predict future locations using embedded sensors. This information allows service providers to offer relevant and timely services, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and engagement.

### Methods for Deriving Location Data

#### Host-Based Approach
An installed application can infer the device's location by accessing built-in sensors or evaluating data from social media check-ins. Local sensors include Wi-Fi hotspot information (SSID and BSSID), connected cell towers, and GPS. Location can also be inferred through side-channel attacks, such as power supply variance analysis.

#### Network-Based Approach
The location of a mobile device can be determined using cell tower triangulation or analyzing Call Detail Records (CDRs). This requires high-privileged access, typically available to service providers and law enforcement agencies.

To utilize location traces effectively, it is essential to analyze and aggregate the data into meaningful location clusters, such as home, shopping, or work, known as POIs. The most common method for inferring POIs is by clustering location traces based on distance and time thresholds.

### Privacy Concerns
Location data collected on mobile devices may be provided to third-party services by applications or leaked by malicious applications. Recent research has reported a high rate of personal data leakage by popular applications over insecure communication channels without user awareness. According to Trend Micro, location permission is the most abused Android application permission. During the 2018 DEFCON workshops, both iOS and Android applications were found to send accurate location data in unencrypted formats.

Recent studies have focused on the privacy risks associated with legitimate or malicious applications granted location access. However, these studies primarily analyzed the exposure of private data to specific applications or location-based service providers. In practice, multiple applications with location access are installed on each device, necessitating an exploration of the implications of location data leakage by multiple applications.

### Research Goals
This study investigates location data leakage in the internet traffic of Android-based smartphones by multiple applications. The main goals are:
1. To understand the amount and quality of location data leaked in plaintext.
2. To analyze the location leaks to infer the user’s POIs.
3. To evaluate the privacy exposure level in terms of the number of identified POIs, the amount of data required, accuracy, and time spent in POIs.

### Methodology
We collected and analyzed the internet traffic of 71 smartphone users over an average of 37 days. Additionally, we used a dedicated Android agent to sample the location sensor and provide ground truth for the actual location. Our results show that over 85% of users' devices leaked location data, and the exposure rate of POIs derived from sparse leakage indicators is around 61%. Even with low location leakage rates, approximately 70% of weighted POIs can be exposed.

### Contributions
1. We explore the scope, volume, and quality of location-based data leaked via insecure, unencrypted network traffic.
2. We conduct an empirical evaluation based on real data from mobile devices, involving a unique dataset.
3. We present a methodological process for collecting, processing, and filtering location-based data from network traffic to infer POIs.
4. We present a step-by-step attack aimed at leaking location data and inferring POIs from a device’s network traffic under realistic assumptions.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Privacy in Location-Based Services
According to the GDPR, personal data (PII) includes any data that can identify a person, such as name, ID, social media identity, and location. PII leaks are a major privacy concern for mobile device users. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to de-anonymize users using location traces. Location permission is commonly requested by most mobile apps, posing a real threat to users' privacy if not handled properly.

### 2.2 POI Identification Methods
Inferring meaningful locations from aggregated location traces is a well-studied field. Common algorithms include DBSCAN, ST-DBSCAN, and the incremental method by Kang et al. These methods cluster places based on time and distance thresholds to differentiate stay points from transit points, improving trajectory analysis.

## 3. Threat Model

Our threat model focuses on an adversary capable of eavesdropping on mobile device network traffic and exposed to personal, sensitive information transmitted in plaintext. Previous research has discussed personal information disclosure and inference from network traffic leakage, but mainly dealt with static information. In our case, we analyze location data over time to obtain contextual information, assuming continuous capture of network traffic. Potential threat actors include Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), VPN and proxy servers, and Tor-like solutions.
