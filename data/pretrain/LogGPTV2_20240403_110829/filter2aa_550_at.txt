“Direct Influence” by Factor.
According to Matrix X, the most influential factor in strategic cyber security today 
is the ability of so many cyber attackers to remain anonymous to their victims. The 
second most important factor is the seemingly endless list of IT vulnerabilities from 
which cyber attackers are able to choose.
The most effective mitigation strategy in this list, and the only one to rank as more 
influential than any one of the attacker advantages, is the application of the world’s 
most influential military treatise, Sun Tzu’s Art of War, to cyber conflict. The least 
influential mitigation strategy is cyber arms control, which suffers enormously from 
the fact that it is difficult to define a cyber weapon and even more difficult to conduct 
a cyber weapons inspection.
Fig. 7 adds the columns of Matrix X in order to show each factor’s level of suscepti-
bility to influence from the other factors in the matrix.

Figure 7. 
Susceptibility to Influence.
The results are intriguing: both the highest- and lowest-ranked factors are miti-
gation strategies. This appears illogical, but a closer look reveals why. The most 
influenced factor in Matrix X – deterrence – is a purely psychological condition, 
highly dependent on human perception and emotion; thus, it is not surprising that 
deterrence would be highly susceptible to outside influence. The least influenced 
factor is IPv6, which is pure technology and therefore tied to human failings to a 
far lesser degree.
Unfortunately for cyber defense, this list shows that cyber attack advantages not 
only have a higher “direct influence” score than the mitigation strategies, but that 
they are also more resistant to outside influence. In Fig. 7, the mitigation strategies 
have an average score of 22, compared to just 20.2 for the advantages. IPv6 scores 
well, but the other three strategies do not.
One way to interpret Fig. 7 is to view the “susceptibility to influence” score as a 
measure of a factor’s reliability, as well as the confidence that a decision maker 
could place in it. Thus, cyber attackers are able to rely on their advantages to a much 
greater degree than cyber defenders can count on current attack mitigation strate-
gies. At this point in time, three examined strategies – deterrence, doctrine, and 
arms control – are of dubious help to cyber defense.
Perhaps even more ominously, the two most influential cyber attack advantages 
– anonymity and IT vulnerabilities – are also the two most difficult cyber attack ad-
vantages to influence.  Thus, they may prove extremely difficult challenges for cyber 
defenders to overcome in the future.

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH RESULTS
On a positive note, Fig. 7 shows that finding ways to improve cyber defense, such as 
by hiring the right personnel and by providing them quality training, could yield a 
high return on investment. “Inadequate cyber defense” has the fourth-highest “di-
rect influence” score in Matrix X, and it is also the third-highest factor in terms of 
susceptibility to outside influence. This makes it a critical factor in the strategic 
cyber security environment.
Causal Loop Diagram
The next step in DEMATEL analysis involves constructing a causal loop diagram, 
as seen in Fig. 8. Such a visual representation of complex data can facilitate human 
understanding by making the information clearer and more compelling. All factors 
are placed into a systemic cause-and-effect illustration.
In general, the fewer number of parameters that a system contains, the easier it is to 
control, and the easier it is to display in a graph. Matrix X is large enough – 9x9, or 
81 values – that it is already a complex system.
In order to make the diagram most useful for this analysis, the author has chosen 
to display only the “very high” levels of influence between the factors in Matrix X.
Figure 8. 
Strategic Cyber Security: Causal Loop Diagram.

Key Findings
The color of each factor is shaded according to the number of “very high” levels of 
influence it projects to the other factors in the system. Thus, as “anonymity” is the 
most influential factor in Matrix X, it has the darkest color of all factors in Fig. 8. 
Anonymity impacts almost every other factor in the system at the highest possible 
level.
Two factors, deterrence and arms control, remain white because they do not affect 
any other factor at the highest level. These are the least influential factors in Matrix 
X, in Fig. 6, and in this diagram. Cyber attack deterrence, in particular, is dominated 
by four other, high-impact factors, making it the most susceptible of all factors to 
outside influence, and the least reliable mitigation strategy for strategic cyber de-
fense.
A causal loop diagram reveals another key aspect of the interrelationship between 
factors in a system: some have multiple important connections to other factors, re-
gardless of whether the influence is given or received, while others have few. After 
anonymity – asymmetry, military doctrine, and inadequate cyber defense each have 
at least five “very high” influence relationships with other factors. This allows them 
to play a critical role in the system. If decision makers are able to change the nature 
of any one of these factors in a significant way, the resultant impact on the system 
as a whole could be considerable.
Calculating Indirect Influence
A close analysis of the causal loop diagram above reveals that each factor not only 
has a direct influence on every other factor in the system, but that it also has indirect 
or transitive influences on the other factors. Eventually, every factor in the system 
will even influence itself.
Fig. 9 below depicts the dynamic of indirect influence at work.

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH RESULTS
The DEMATEL method is one of the easiest and most useful ways to calculate the 
sum of direct and indirect influences for a group of interrelated factors.459 First, 
Matrix X is transformed into normalized Matrix D. The new numbers are derived 
by dividing the values in Matrix X by the single highest sum found in the rows/
columns, which is Anonymity (whose “direct influence” score is 30).
Thus, the new influence levels are: 0=0, 1=.0333, 2=.0667, 3=.1000, and 4=.1333. 
Matrix D is depicted in Fig. 10.
