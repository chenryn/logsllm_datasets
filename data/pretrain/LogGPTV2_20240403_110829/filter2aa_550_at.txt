**Figure 6. Direct Influence by Factor**

According to Matrix X, the most influential factor in strategic cyber security today is the ability of many cyber attackers to remain anonymous to their victims. The second most important factor is the extensive list of IT vulnerabilities from which cyber attackers can choose.

The most effective mitigation strategy, and the only one to rank higher than any attacker advantage, is the application of Sun Tzu’s Art of War to cyber conflict. The least influential mitigation strategy is cyber arms control, which faces significant challenges due to the difficulty in defining and inspecting cyber weapons.

### Susceptibility to Influence

**Figure 7. Susceptibility to Influence**

The results are intriguing: both the highest- and lowest-ranked factors are mitigation strategies. This may seem illogical, but a closer look reveals why. The most influenced factor, deterrence, is a purely psychological condition, highly dependent on human perception and emotion, making it highly susceptible to outside influence. Conversely, IPv6, the least influenced factor, is a technological standard and thus less tied to human failings.

Unfortunately for cyber defense, the advantages of cyber attacks not only have higher "direct influence" scores than the mitigation strategies but are also more resistant to outside influence. In Figure 7, the average susceptibility score for mitigation strategies is 22, compared to 20.2 for the attack advantages. While IPv6 scores well, the other three strategies do not.

One way to interpret Figure 7 is to view the "susceptibility to influence" score as a measure of a factor's reliability and the confidence a decision-maker can place in it. Thus, cyber attackers can rely on their advantages to a much greater degree than cyber defenders can count on current mitigation strategies. At this point, three examined strategies—deterrence, doctrine, and arms control—are of dubious help to cyber defense.

Perhaps even more concerning, the two most influential cyber attack advantages—anonymity and IT vulnerabilities—are also the most difficult to influence, posing significant challenges for cyber defenders in the future.

On a positive note, Figure 7 shows that improving cyber defense, such as by hiring the right personnel and providing quality training, could yield a high return on investment. "Inadequate cyber defense" has the fourth-highest "direct influence" score in Matrix X and is the third-highest factor in terms of susceptibility to outside influence, making it a critical factor in the strategic cyber security environment.

### Causal Loop Diagram

The next step in DEMATEL analysis involves constructing a causal loop diagram (Figure 8). This visual representation helps to clarify complex data, making it easier to understand. All factors are placed into a systemic cause-and-effect illustration.

In general, systems with fewer parameters are easier to control and display. Matrix X, being a 9x9 matrix with 81 values, is already a complex system. To make the diagram most useful, only the "very high" levels of influence between the factors in Matrix X are displayed.

**Figure 8. Strategic Cyber Security: Causal Loop Diagram**

The color of each factor is shaded according to the number of "very high" levels of influence it projects to other factors in the system. "Anonymity," the most influential factor in Matrix X, has the darkest color. It impacts almost every other factor at the highest possible level.

Two factors, deterrence and arms control, remain white because they do not affect any other factor at the highest level. These are the least influential factors in Matrix X, as shown in Figures 6 and 8. Cyber attack deterrence, in particular, is dominated by four high-impact factors, making it the most susceptible to outside influence and the least reliable mitigation strategy for strategic cyber defense.

A causal loop diagram also reveals that some factors have multiple important connections to others, regardless of whether the influence is given or received, while others have few. After anonymity, asymmetry, military doctrine, and inadequate cyber defense each have at least five "very high" influence relationships with other factors, allowing them to play a critical role in the system. If decision-makers can significantly change any one of these factors, the impact on the system as a whole could be considerable.

### Calculating Indirect Influence

A close analysis of the causal loop diagram reveals that each factor not only has a direct influence on every other factor in the system but also has indirect or transitive influences. Eventually, every factor will even influence itself.

**Figure 9. Indirect Influence**

The DEMATEL method is one of the easiest and most useful ways to calculate the sum of direct and indirect influences for a group of interrelated factors. First, Matrix X is transformed into normalized Matrix D. The new numbers are derived by dividing the values in Matrix X by the single highest sum found in the rows/columns, which is Anonymity (with a "direct influence" score of 30).

Thus, the new influence levels are: 0=0, 1=.0333, 2=.0667, 3=.1000, and 4=.1333. Matrix D is depicted in Figure 10.

Second, Matrix D is transformed into the "Total Influence" Matrix T, in which DEMATEL calculates the sum of direct and indirect influences for each factor.
