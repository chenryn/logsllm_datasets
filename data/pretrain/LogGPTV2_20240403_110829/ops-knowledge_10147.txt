To effectively implement CIS Control 3.14, "Log Sensitive Data Access," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Identify Sensitive Data**: Clearly define and categorize the types of sensitive data that your organization handles. This includes personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, intellectual property, and any other critical data.

2. **Implement Logging Mechanisms**: Ensure that all access to sensitive data is logged. This includes read, write, modification, and deletion activities. The logs should capture detailed information such as the user, timestamp, type of access, and the specific data accessed.

3. **Configure Log Retention and Protection**: Establish policies for log retention to ensure that logs are stored for a sufficient period for forensic analysis and compliance. Additionally, protect the integrity and confidentiality of the logs by implementing appropriate security controls, such as encryption and access controls.

4. **Monitor and Analyze Logs**: Regularly review and analyze the logs to detect and respond to unauthorized or suspicious access. Implement automated monitoring tools to alert the security team to potential security incidents in real-time.

5. **Integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems**: Integrate the logging mechanisms with SIEM systems to correlate and analyze log data from multiple sources. This can help in identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate a security threat.

6. **Conduct Regular Audits and Reviews**: Perform regular audits and reviews of the logging and monitoring processes to ensure they are functioning as intended and to identify areas for improvement.

By following these procedures, an organization can enhance its ability to detect and respond to unauthorized access to sensitive data, thereby improving overall security posture. CIS Control 3.14 falls under the asset type "Data" and serves the security function of "Detect."
