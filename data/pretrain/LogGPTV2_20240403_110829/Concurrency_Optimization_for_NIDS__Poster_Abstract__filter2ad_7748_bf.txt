### C. elegans Population Sample Preparation and Analysis

Sample preparation for *C. elegans* populations was conducted by two individuals in triplicate, with each set of samples analyzed using an Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer in separate laboratories. This approach aimed to assess both intra-analyst and instrumental variance. The initial factorial design was employed to identify the key parameters that significantly influence extraction efficiency.

Subsequently, a Taguchi Design of Experiments (DoE) method was used to further analyze these parameters. The goal was to determine the pre-analytical sample preparation conditions that minimized artifact production, provided the highest metabolome coverage, and ensured the highest reproducibility. An L9-orthogonal array was utilized, with four factors: extraction solvent, volume ratio, method of extraction, and reconstitution solvent.

Future work will include MS/MS experiments using both Orbitrap and FT-ICR mass spectrometers to test the resolving power limits of the Orbitrap and establish the minimum requirements for FT-ICR analysis of metabolomics samples.

**A High-Throughput Method for Obtaining Microbial Exometabolomics Data Using a 3D Printed Platform**

Microbial interactions are governed by a vast array of small molecules. Currently, our understanding of microbial communication is largely based on a limited number of quorum sensing molecules. This limitation is partly due to the low-throughput and high cost of most mass spectrometry (MS)-based experimental approaches. To address this, we developed a 3D-printed device for monitoring the exometabolome of pairs of microorganisms grown in interconnected environments. This device facilitates the co-culture of microorganisms with or without additional stimuli (e.g., nutrients, drugs). Coupled with high-throughput robotics (e.g., Triversa Nanomate robot) and MS, the platform can measure an exometabolome in just 4 minutes at a cost of only US$2. We validated our approach using mixtures of 27 known compounds at decreasing concentrations, detecting 79% and 17% of known compounds at 10 nmol and 10 pmol, respectively. Additionally, we applied the platform to study co-cultures of five soil microbes at different time points. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) revealed high repeatability, a transition of the exometabolome over time, and a clear signal of species domination within the exometabolome. After subtracting MS features related to media, we identified small molecules excreted by individual microbes. This approach enables the processing of a large number of samples, unlocking previously insurmountable problems such as deciphering higher-order principles of inter-cellular communication. Understanding the language of the microbiome may bring us closer to manipulating microorganisms through small molecule communication.

**Focused Metabolomics Based on TMT Labeling for Improving Throughput and Quantification**
- **Presenting Author**: Yoshiya Oda, The University of Tokyo, Japan
- **Co-Authors**: Suzumi M. Tokuoka, Yoshihiro Kita

In metabolomics, quantification is often more important than identification. Performing quantitative analysis on many hundreds of samples is more critical than identifying thousands of molecules in a single experiment, which is more common in proteomics. Stable isotope-labeled substances are commonly used as internal standards to correct for variations during ionization. However, preparing such standards for all targets is impractical when there are many. To improve multi-sample processing and quantification, isobaric tagging methods like iTRAQ or TMT have been developed. These methods use MS/MS spectra for relative quantification, allowing for comparison between samples without the need for isotope-labeled internal standards by adding one sample as a control. Despite their effectiveness, these methods have not been widely adopted in metabolomics, partly because the derivatization reaction is limited to metabolites with specific functional groups, such as primary amine groups. Carboxy group-containing metabolites are preferred for derivatization but require activation before labeling. We investigated various derivatization conditions suitable for metabolomics and applied them to human plasma sample analysis. Our approach, while not comprehensive, is a practical method for performing quantitative analysis on hundreds of samples.

Metabolomic and proteomic profiling of liver tissue is a powerful approach for characterizing molecular processes underlying drug uptake and metabolism. The heterogeneous nature of tissue and the limited availability of biopsies necessitate protocols that maximize information yield from a single sample. We demonstrate a strategy for the quantitative assessment of metabolites and proteins from the same liver tissue using a single MS platform. Samples were sequentially subjected to metabolite extraction and urea-based protein extraction, followed by tryptic digestion. Metabolites were analyzed after HILIC separation in positive and negative ionization modes, while peptides were monitored by C18-RP LC-MS/MS. Fragment spectra acquired by data-dependent MS/MS measurements enabled the structural assignment and identification of a broad range of metabolite classes and over 1,000 proteins. Over 75% of the annotated metabolic features exhibited CVs < 0.91. 2D 31P/1H HSQC MR spectra from organoids and cell extracts displayed potential discriminative biomarkers such as phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine, and glycerophosphoethanolamine. These results show that high-quality MR spectra can be obtained from organoids, and they are highly correlated with polar cell extracts, indicating that metabolite extraction is not required for high-quality spectra. The use of 1D 1H and 2D 31P/1H HSQC MR spectra from organoids enables the identification of potential discriminative biomarkers for stratifying patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

**Space-Resolved Sampling and Metabolomics Analysis of the Oral Cavity**
- **Presenting Author**: Alessio Ciurli, LUMC, Netherlands

Saliva is a complex biofluid that maintains oral health through lubrication, clearance, buffering, antibacterial activity, taste, and digestion. Advanced analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, facilitate the analysis of saliva, providing insights into the health and disease of the oral cavity and systemic alterations, such as hormone levels. Saliva can be easily collected through non-invasive procedures like direct spitting or swabs. It is a mixture of fluids secreted from three distinct salivary glands: the parotids, submandibulars, and sublingual glands. We developed a novel sampling method with spatial sampling capability, allowing for the comprehensive metabolomics analysis of different oral biofilms originating from saliva secreted by different glands. In this study, saliva samples were collected using micro-cellulose swabs from five different oral locations. Absorbed saliva was extracted and analyzed using our LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics platform (HILIC on Shimadzu Nexera LC-30 HPLC system – TripleTOF 6600 system ABSciex). Raw data were processed using MSDIAL and R Studio for further analyses and visualizations. PCA analysis revealed a unique metabolic profile depending on the oral location. These outcomes highlight the potential of space-resolved metabolomic profiling for a deeper understanding of the biochemical environment of the oral cavity and the distribution of oral diseases, such as head & neck cancer or periodontal disease.

Hepatic injury associated with amphetamine-like drugs has been extensively reported, but the mechanisms underlying liver damage at human-relevant concentrations are not fully understood. We used a sensitive non-target metabolomic approach based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify early adverse events caused by amphetamine-like drugs (MDMA, MDPV, and methylone) in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Intracellular metabolome analysis of PMH exposed for 24 hours to two subtoxic concentrations of each drug (corresponding to LC01 and LC10 levels) was performed. Traditional toxicological endpoints (MTT and LDH cell viability, GSH, and ATP assays) were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis showed that each drug induces metabolome alterations in a concentration-dependent manner. Most altered metabolites belong to amino acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and carboxylic acids. The combination of metabolites and their respective levels was unique for each tested drug, providing insights into their specific toxicological outcomes and mechanisms of toxicity. Our data provide compelling evidence that metabolomics is a suitable and more sensitive approach compared to conventional toxicological assays, as significant alterations in metabolite levels were observed even at the lowest concentration tested. To our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting the potential of intracellular metabolome analysis to assess the early adverse events of drugs of abuse, providing new insights into their mechanisms of toxicity.

**NMR-Based Metabolomics: A Novel Tool to Study Stress in Wild Birds**
- **Presenting Author**: Karen Machin, University of Saskatchewan, Canada
- **Co-Authors**: Asha Perera, Catherine Soos

Metabolomics examines fluctuations in small metabolite levels in biological systems and is useful for studying the effects of natural and anthropogenic environmental stressors on organisms. The vertebrate stress response re-routes energy typically used for maintaining homeostasis toward metabolic processes that provide immediate survival energy, affecting the metabolome at the cellular level. While metabolomics has been successfully applied in invertebrates and mammals, its use in wild birds is still in its infancy. Our main objective was to validate the use of metabolomics in evaluating the effects of stress on the metabolome of waterfowl. Captive lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) were implanted with either a biodegradable corticosterone pellet to mimic chronic stress or a placebo pellet. 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed on serum samples collected during the active implant period. We hypothesized that metabolomics could differentiate ducks with higher serum corticosterone from control individuals. Our results showed that serum metabolite profiles could successfully differentiate stressed ducks from controls. We identified multiple key metabolites that varied between the two groups, all of which play important roles in energy metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the use of NMR-based metabolomics techniques to study stress responses in a wild bird species. Metabolomic techniques may be a valuable tool for identifying and characterizing metabolic responses associated with environmental stressors in wild birds.

**Metabolic Changes in Murine Hair Follicles Treated with Procyanidin-B2 Nutraceuticals by DI-MRMS**
- **Presenting Author**: Matthias Witt, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany
- **Co-Authors**: Eduardo Sommella, Emanuela Salviati, Christopher Thomson, Pietro Campiglia

Procyanidin-B2 nutraceuticals, known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, promote hair growth both in vitro and in vivo. However, the metabolic changes associated with this treatment have not been fully elucidated. In this study, direct infusion magnetic resonance mass spectrometry (DI-MRMS) was used to understand the metabolic shifts produced by treatment with procyanidin-B2 nutraceuticals (Annurca apple extract) in murine models. DI-MRMS allowed the identification of several metabolites using ultra-high mass accuracy and fast analysis time. Metabolites related to glutaminolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione, citrulline, and nucleotide synthesis were detected. The metabolic profile revealed significant changes in these pathways, providing insights into the mechanisms by which procyanidin-B2 promotes hair growth.
