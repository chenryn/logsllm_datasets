A high-throughput method for obtaining microbial exometabolomics data using a 3D printed platform
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Caroline Birer, University of Pittsburgh, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Rosalie K. Chu, Christopher R. Anderton, Erik S. Wright
Microbial interactions are governed by an immense variety of small molecules To date, our understanding of microbial communication is largely 
based on a small number of molecules used for quorum sensing This limitation is partly explained by the low-throughput and high cost of most 
experimental approaches using mass spectrometry (MS) Here, we engineered a 3Dprinted device for eavesdropping on the exometabolome 
of pairs of microorganisms grown in interconnected environments Our device can be used to easily co-culture microorganisms with or without 
additional stimuli (eg nutrients, drugs, etc) Coupled with high-throughput robotics (eg, Triversa Nanomate robot) and MS, the platform can be 
used to measure an exometabolome in 4minutes at a cost of only US$2 We have validated our approach with mixtures of 27known compounds 
at decreasing concentrations, where we were able to detect 79% and 17% of known compounds 10nmol and 10pmol, respectively Furthermore, 
we applied the platform to study co-cultures of 5soil microbes at different time points after growth Principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) revealed 
a high degree of repeatability, a transition of the exometabolome over time, and a clear signal species domination within the exometabolome 
After subtracting mass spectrometry features related to media, we were able to pinpoint small molecules excreted by each individual microbe 
This approach enables us to process an immense number of samples, unlocking previously insurmountable problems such as decrypting the 
higher-order principles of inter-cellular communication Interpreting the language of the microbiome may bring us one step closer to manipulating 
microorganisms by communicating through small molecules

Focused metabolomics based on TMT labeling for improving throughput and quantification
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yoshiya Oda, The University of Tokyo, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Suzumi M Tokuoka, Yoshihiro Kita
In metabolomics, the importance is placed on quantification rather than identification Then, preforming quantitative analysis of many hundreds of 
samples is more important in metabolomics than identifying thousands of molecules in a single experiment, though proteomics often put emphasis 
on the latter In quantitative analysis, stable isotope labeled substances are commonly used as internal standards for the target molecules to correct 
for variations during ionization However, when there are many targets, it is not practical to prepare such internal standards for all targets Improving 
multi-sample processing capacity and quantification in proteomics, isobaric tagging method so called iTRAQ or TMT method have been developed, 
in which MS/MS spectrum is used for relative quantification, iTRAQ/TMT is capable of relative quantification between the samples without 
isotope labeled internal standards by constantly adding one of the samples as a control Despite this excellent method, it has hardly been used in 
metabolomics One of the reasons is that the derivatization reaction is limited for the metabolite having a specific functional group such as a primary 
amine group Metabolites having a carboxy group is preferred for derivatization, but in order to label the carboxy group, it has to be activated before 
labeling Therefore, we investigated various derivatization conditions suitable for metabolomics While finding some problems which have not been 
reported in proteomics, we came to apply to human plasma sample analysis Our approach is not comprehensive metabolomics, but it is more 
practical method to perform quantitative analysis of hundreds of samples

Single-platform metabolomic and proteomic profiling of human liver tissue
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Thierry Schmidlin, Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch - Institut für Klinische Pharmakologie, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Thierry Schmidlin, Kathrin Klein, Matthias Schwab, Thomas E. Mürdter, Ute Hofmann, Mathias Haag
Metabolomic and proteomic profiling of liver tissue represents a powerful approach for the functional characterization of molecular processes 
underlying drug uptake and metabolism However, the heterogeneous nature of tissue and the limited availability of biopsies demand for protocols 
that utilize samples in an economic fashion by simultaneously increasing information yield through recovering metabolites and proteins from a single 
sample Here we demonstrate a strategy for the quantitative assessment of metabolites and proteins recovered from the very same liver tissue 
analyzed on the same MS platform Samples were sequentially subjected to metabolite extraction and urea-based protein extraction protocols 
followed by tryptic digest Metabolites were analyzed after HILIC separation in positive and negative ionization mode whereas peptides were 
monitored by C18-RP LC-MS/MS Fragment spectra, acquired by data-dependent MS/MS measurements, enabled the structural assignment and 
identification of a broad range of metabolite classes and >1000 proteins, respectively Over 75% of the annotated metabolic features exhibited CVs 
091) 2D 31P/1H HSQC MR spectra from organoids and cell extracts display potential 
discriminative biomarkers like phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine and glycerophoshpoethanolamine Discussion: 
The results from this study show that we are able to acquire high quality MR spectra from organoids MR spectra from organoids and polar cell 
extracts were highly correlated, indicating that metabolite extraction is not required to achieve high quality spectra Use of 1D 1H and 2D 31P/1H 
HSQC MR spectra from organoids enables identification of potential discriminative biomarkers that can be used for stratification of patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer References: 1 Sato, T, et al, Gastroenterology, 2011 141(5): p 1762-72

Space-resolved sampling and metabolomics analysis of the oral cavity
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alessio Ciurli, LUMC, Netherlands
Saliva is a complex Biofluid that serves to maintain oral health through lubrification, clearance, buffering, antibacterial activity, taste, and digestion 
Nowadays, high sensitivity of advanced analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, facilitate the analysis of saliva Such analysis offers an 
enviable number of insights into health and disease of the oral cavity as well as into systematic alterations as for example hormone level Saliva 
can be easily collected through non-invasive procedures such as direct split or use of swabs Saliva is a mixture of different fluids secreted from 
three distinct salivary glands, namely, the parotids, the submandibulars, and the sublingual glands Here we developed a novel sampling method 
with spatial sampling capability, allowing for the comprehensive metabolomics analysis of different oral biofilms originated from saliva secreted of 
different glands In the present study, saliva samples were collected using micro-cellulose swabs in 5 different oral locations Absorbed saliva was 
extracted and, subsequently, analyzed by our LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics platform (HILIC on Shimazdu Nexera LC-30 HPLC system – TripleTOF 
6600 system ABSciex) Finally, the raw data were processed using MSDIAL and R Studio for further analyses and visualizations PCA analysis 
displayed a peculiar metabolic profiling depending the oral location The present outcomes display the potential of space-resolved metabolomic 
profiling in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the biochemical environment of the oral cavity and the distribution of oral disease, such as 
head & neck cancer or periodontal disease

Use of metabolomics for exploring early mechanisms of hepatotoxicity triggered by amphetamine-like drugs
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ana Margarida Araújo, UCIBIO, REQUIMTE, Faculty of Pharmacy of University of Porto (FFUP), Portugal
CO-AUTHORS: Ana Margarida Araújo, Eduarda Fernandes, Maria de Lourdes Bastos, Félix Carvalho, Paula Guedes de Pinho, Márcia Carvalho
Hepatic injury associated with amphetamine-like drugs has been extensively reported, but the mechanisms underlying liver damage caused 
at human relevant concentrations have not been fully elucidated In this work, we used a sensitive non-target metabolomic approach based on 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the early adverse events caused by amphetamine-like drugs (MDMA, MDPV and 
methylone) in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) Intracellular metabolome analysis of PMH exposed for 24h to two subtoxic concentrations 
of each drug (corresponding to LC01 and LC10 levels) was performed In order to establish the value of metabolomics to reveal drug toxicity 
mechanisms, traditional toxicological endpoints (ie MTT and LDH cell viability, GSH and ATP assays) were also evaluated The results obtained 
by the multivariate analysis showed that each drug induces metabolome alterations in a concentration-dependent manner Most of the altered 
metabolites belong to the class of amino acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates and carboxylic acids The combination of metabolites and their respective 
levels was unique for each tested drug, being therefore useful in understanding their specific toxicological outcome and mechanisms of toxicity 
Most importantly, our data provide compelling evidence that metabolomics is a suitable and even more sensitive approach when compared to 
conventional toxicological assays, as significant alterations in metabolite levels were already found at the lowest concentration tested To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting the potential of the intracellular metabolome analysis to assess the early adverse events of drugs 
of abuse, providing new insights into their mechanisms of toxicity

NMR-based metabolomics: a novel tool to study stress in wild bird
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Karen Machin, University of Saskatchewan, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Asha Perera, Catherine Soos
Metabolomics examines fluctuations in small metabolite levels in biological systems An important application of metabolomics is the study of 
effects of natural and anthropogenic environmental stressors on organisms The vertebrate stress response functions to re-route energy typically 
utilized for maintaining homeostasis, toward metabolic processes that provide energy available for immediate survival functions, thus affecting the 
metabolome at the cellular level While multiple studies have successfully applied metabolomics techniques in invertebrate and mammalian species, 
the use of this technique in wild birds is still in its infancy Our main objective was to validate the use of metabolomics in evaluating effects of stress 
on the metabolome of waterfowl Captive lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) were implanted with either a biodegradable corticosterone pellet to mimic 
effects of chronic stress, or a placebo pellet H1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed on serum samples collected 
during the active implant period We hypothesized that metabolomics can be used to differentiate ducks that received exogenous corticosterone 
from placebo (control) We found that serum metabolite profiles could be successfully used to differentiate ducks with higher serum corticosterone 
from control individuals We further identified multiple key metabolites that varied between the two groups, all of which play important roles 
in energy metabolism To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the use of NMR-based metabolomics techniques to study stress 
responses in a wild bird species Metabolomic techniques may be a potential tool in identifying and characterizing metabolic responses associated 
with environmental stressors in wild birds

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Matthias Witt, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Eduardo Sommella, Emanuela Salviati, Christopher Thomson, Pietro Campiglia
Known for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, nutraceuticals enriched in Procyanidin-B2 promote hair growth both in vitro and in vivo 
However, the metabolic changes associated with the treatment have not been elucidated In this study, direct infusion magnetic resonance mass 
spectrometry (DI-MRMS) was employed to understand the metabolic shift produced by treatment with Procyaindin-B2 nutraceuticals (Annurca 
apple extract) in murine models DI-MRMS allowed the identification of several metabolites using ultra-high mass accuracy and fast analysis time, 
glutaminolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione, citrulline and nucleotide synthesis derived metabolite were detected The metabolic profile
