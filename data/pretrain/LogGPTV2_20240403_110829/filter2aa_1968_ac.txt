The proposition is logically sound. If A grants a software license to B on the express condition that the license will remain in effect only so long as B makes monthly payments to A, and B subsequently stops making these payments, any further copying of the software to RAM by B would constitute copyright infringement. This conclusion was agreed upon by MDY’s counsel during oral argument. This holds true even though the act that takes B outside the scope of the license (nonpayment) is different from the act that constitutes infringement (subsequent copying of the software). The Court cannot accept MDY’s assertion, at least under Ninth Circuit law, that the act that takes one outside the scope of the license and the act that constitutes infringement must be the same.

Even if MDY’s proposition were correct, it would not alter the outcome in this case. The act that violates the End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms of Use (TOU) and takes Glider users outside the scope of Blizzard’s limited license is the use of Glider to play World of Warcraft (WoW). This use necessarily includes copying the game client software to RAM. Therefore, the act that exceeds the scope of the license and the act that violates Blizzard’s copyright are the same.

#### MDY’s Other Arguments
MDY does not dispute that the requirements for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement are met if the use of Glider constitutes infringement. However, MDY contends that certain factual disputes preclude summary judgment in favor of Blizzard on the contributory and vicarious infringement claims. (Dkt. #57 at 11).

First, MDY argues that there is a dispute as to whether Blizzard has ever terminated a license pursuant to the terms of the EULA. (Id.). However, MDY has not provided any argument or legal authority to suggest that Glider users infringe Blizzard’s copyright only if Blizzard affirmatively terminates the limited license. Users may infringe if they engage in an act of copying that is outside the scope of the limited license granted by Blizzard. Whether Blizzard has ever terminated a license is therefore immaterial.

Next, MDY contends that there is a factual issue as to whether “the EULA or TOU precluded ‘bots.’” (Id.). There is no such issue. As MDY itself acknowledges, the operative version of the TOU expressly prohibits bots. (Dkt. #58 ¶ 67; see Dkt. #41-8 at 4 (§ 4(B)(ii))).

MDY also asserts a factual dispute as to whether the violations of the TOU were “within the reasonable expectations of MDY or its customers as required under Arizona law.” (Dkt. #57 at 11). This purported dispute is immaterial because both the EULA and TOU are governed by Delaware law. (See Dkt. #42 at 8-9 (EULA § 14(f)); Dkt. #41-8 at 14 (TOU § 16(F))). Moreover, any person reading the TOU would clearly understand that a licensee is not authorized to play WoW using Glider.

Finally, MDY claims that a dispute exists as to whether the RAM copying Blizzard alleges here is the same as the RAM copying in MAI. However, whether the loading of software into RAM constitutes “copying” for purposes of copyright law is a legal, not a factual, question. This issue has been resolved by MAI: “[T]he loading of software into RAM creates a copy under the Copyright Act.” 991 F.2d at 519. MDY cites no case to the contrary.

### B.
#### Has MDY Established the Copyright “Misuse” Defense?
The defense of copyright misuse prevents copyright holders from leveraging their limited monopoly to control areas outside the monopoly. (A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1026 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Lasercomb Am., Inc. v. Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970, 979 (4th Cir. 1990))). MDY contends that Blizzard’s prohibition of bots constitutes copyright misuse because Blizzard is controlling its “licensees’ use of independently created and noninfringing third party software.” (Dkt. #57 at 14). However, as explained above, the use of Glider does infringe Blizzard’s copyright. Furthermore, while Blizzard has limited the license of its WoW software, there is no evidence that Blizzard has sought to bar third parties from developing competing games. (See A&M, 239 F.3d at 1027 (rejecting misuse defense where there was no evidence plaintiffs sought to control areas outside the grant of copyright); Triad Sys. Corp. v. S.E. Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330, 1337 (9th Cir. 1995) (rejecting misuse defense because, unlike Lasercomb, “Triad did not attempt to prohibit [the defendant] from developing its own service software to compete with Triad”)). MDY has not established the copyright misuse defense.

### C.
#### Does 17 U.S.C. § 117 Require a Finding of Non-infringement?
Section 117 permits the “owner” of a copy of a computer program to copy the program to RAM if the copy is created as an essential step in using the program. Section 117 provides, in relevant part:
“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program.”
17 U.S.C. § 117(a)(1).

Public Knowledge’s amicus brief contends that WoW users are “owners” of copies of the game client software within the meaning of section 117, that copying the software to RAM is an essential step in using the game client software, and that the act of copying to RAM is, therefore, not an infringement, even when done in connection with Glider. (Dkt. #65). MDY adopts this argument in its reply memorandum. (Dkt. #69 at 2, 5, & n.7).

The resolution of this issue is controlled by Ninth Circuit law. At least three cases—MAI, Triad, and Wall Data Inc. v. Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, 447 F.3d 769 (9th Cir. 2006)—hold that licensees of a computer program do not “own” their copy of the program and therefore are not entitled to a section 117 defense. (See MAI, 991 F.2d at 518 n.5; Triad, 64 F.3d at 1333; Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 784-85). Wall Data provides a two-part test for determining whether the purchaser of a copy of a software program is a licensee or an owner: (1) if the copyright holder makes clear that it is granting a license to the copy of the software, and (2) imposes significant restrictions on the use or transfer of the copy, then the transaction is a license, not a sale, and the purchaser of the copy is a licensee, not an “owner” within the meaning of section 117. (Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 785).

In Wall Data, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department purchased nearly 4,000 licenses to Wall Data’s computer software but installed the software on more than 6,000 computers. (Id. at 773). The license granted a right to use the software on a “stand-alone workstation” or a “networked station which [did] not permit the [s]oftware to be shared with other networked stations.” (Id. at 775 n.5). The license also limited the transfer of the software to “not more than once every 30 days.” (Id.). The Ninth Circuit concluded that these restrictions were sufficient to classify the transaction as a grant of a license to Wall Data’s software, and not a sale of Wall Data’s software. (Id. at 785). The court therefore concluded that the Sheriff’s Department was not the “owner” of copies of Wall Data’s software for purposes of § 117. (Id.).

Under the two-part test for ownership in Wall Data, the transactions between Blizzard and persons who acquire copies of its game client software are licenses, not sales. First, Blizzard makes clear that it is granting a license. The EULA expressly states in section 1 that Blizzard is granting a “limited license.” (Dkt. #42 at 2). Section 3 further states that “[a]ll title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Game and all copies thereof . . . are owned or licensed by Blizzard.” (Dkt. #42 at 3 (emphasis added)). The first paragraph of the EULA likewise states that “[t]his software program and any files that are delivered to you by Blizzard . . . and any and all copies and derivative works of such software program . . . is the copyrighted work of Blizzard[.]” (Dkt. #42 at 1 (emphasis added)). The EULA thus makes clear that Blizzard is granting to its users a license, not ownership, of the copies of the game client software.

Second, Blizzard imposes restrictions on the transfer and use of the game client software. The user may transfer his “rights and obligations” under the EULA only by transferring the original media containing the game client software along with all original packaging and all manuals or other documentation distributed with the software; the user must delete all copies and installations of the software from his computer; and the recipient of the software must agree to the terms of the EULA. (Dkt. #42 at 2 (EULA § 3(B))). As discussed above, the TOU places additional restrictions on the use of the software. (See Dkt. #41-8 at 4 (TOU § 4)). These restrictions are at least as severe as the restrictions in Wall Data. The Court concludes, therefore, that users of WoW, including those who use Glider, are licensees of the copies of the game client software and are not entitled to the section 117 defense.

During oral argument, counsel for MDY asserted that a person who purchases a copy of the WoW game client software from a commercial retailer and walks out of the store with the copy in hand certainly would not view himself as a mere licensee of what he just purchased. The person could dispose of the software copy as he chose, throwing it in the trash, giving it to a friend, or installing it on his computer—all consistent with ownership. Counsel for Blizzard responded by noting that the license is clear from notices on the box purchased at the retailer and from a paper copy of the EULA contained in the box, as well as from the online notices that appear when the game client software is installed on a personal computer. One wonders what more could be done to make clear that the purchaser is a licensee, not an owner, of the software. The Court also notes that a complete prohibition on transfer of the software is not an essential requirement of a license under the Ninth Circuit’s holding in Wall Data. The license at issue in Wall Data did not prohibit the transfer of the software. (See Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 775 n. 5; see also Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., — F. Supp. 2d —, No. C07-1189RAJ, 2008 WL 2199682, at *7 (W.D. Wash. May 20, 2008) (the license in Wall Data “imposed no limits on resale of the software”)).

MDY’s counsel also asserted at oral argument that Wall Data is distinguishable from this case because Wall Data involved a negotiated license between the software vendor and the software purchaser, not a standard form license like that contained in the WoW game. MDY is mistaken. The software used in Wall Data was purchased through an approved vendor and was governed by “volume license booklets.” (447 F.3d at 774). The transaction included a “shrink-wrap license, click-through license, and volume license booklets.” (Id. at 775). The specific license at issue was the “standard” click-through license. (Id. at 775 n.5). The Blizzard license in this case is also a standard click-through license.

Finally, MDY urges the Court to follow the approach recently taken by the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in Vernor, 2008 WL 2199682. The Vernor court declined to follow MAI, Triad, and Wall Data, and instead applied an earlier Ninth Circuit case, United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180 (9th Cir. 1977). Wise involved the application of the “first sale” doctrine under 17 U.S.C. § 109 to various transfer contracts between movie studios and recipients of movie prints. Vernor concluded that the critical factor in Wise for determining whether a transaction was a sale or a license was “whether the transferee kept the copy acquired from the copyright holder.” (2008 WL 2199682, at *6). MDY urges the Court to follow Vernor and Wise and hold that the users of the WoW game client software are owners of the software because they are entitled to keep the copy of the software they acquire from Blizzard. The Court declines this invitation. Whatever freedom the court in Vernor may have had to disregard Wall Data when applying a different statutory provision—section 109—this Court does not have the same freedom. This case concerns section 117, the very provision addressed by the Ninth Circuit in Wall Data. The Court is not free to disregard Ninth Circuit precedent directly on point.

### D.
#### Copyright Summary
The Court reaches the following conclusions based on undisputed facts, the construction of the EULA and TOU, and controlling Ninth Circuit law: Blizzard owns a valid copyright in the game client software, Blizzard has granted a limited license for WoW players to use the software, and the use of the software with Glider falls outside the scope of the license.
