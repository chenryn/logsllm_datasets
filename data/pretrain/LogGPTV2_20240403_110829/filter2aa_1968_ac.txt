this proposition make logical sense.  If A grants a software license to B on the express
condition that the license will remain in effect only so long as B makes monthly payments
to A, and B then stops making payments to A, any subsequent copying of the software to
RAM by B would constitute copyright infringement – a conclusion with which MDY’s
counsel agreed during oral argument.  This would be true even though the act that took B
outside the scope of the license – nonpayment – is different from the act that constitutes
infringement – subsequent copying of the software.  The Court cannot accept MDY’s
assertion, at least as a matter of Ninth Circuit law, that the act that takes one outside the
scope of the license and the act that constitutes infringement must be one and the same.
Even if MDY’s proposition were true, however, it would not change the result in this
case.  The act that violates the EULA and TOU and takes Glider users outside the scope of
Blizzard’s limited license is the use of Glider to play WoW, and the use of Glider to play
WoW necessarily includes copying the game client software to RAM.  Thus, the act that
exceeds the scope of the license and the act that violates Blizzard’s copyright are the same.
4.
MDY’s Other Arguments.
MDY does not dispute that the requirements for contributory and vicarious copyright
infringement are met if the use of Glider constitutes infringement.  MDY does contend,
however, that certain factual disputes preclude summary judgment in favor of Blizzard on
the contributory and vicarious infringement claims.  Dkt. #57 at 11.
MDY first contends that there is a dispute as to whether Blizzard has ever terminated
a license pursuant to the terms of the EULA.  Id.  But MDY has presented no argument or
legal authority to suggest that Glider users infringe Blizzard’s copyright only if Blizzard
affirmatively terminates the limited license.  Users may infringe if they engage in an act of
copying that is outside the scope of the limited license granted by Blizzard.  Whether
Blizzard has ever terminated a license is therefore immaterial.
MDY next contends that there is a factual issue as to whether “the EULA or TOU
precluded ‘bots.’”  Id.  There is no such issue.  As MDY itself acknowledges, the operative
version of the TOU expressly prohibits bots.  Dkt. #58 ¶ 67; see Dkt. #41-8 at 4 (§ 4(B)(ii)).

MDY also asserts a factual dispute as to whether the violations of the TOU were
“within the reasonable expectations of MDY or its customers as required under Arizona
law.”  Dkt. #57 at 11.  This purported dispute is immaterial because both the EULA and TOU
are governed by Delaware law.  See Dkt. #42 at 8-9 (EULA § 14(f)); Dkt. #41-8 at 14 (TOU
§ 16(F)).  Moreover, any person reading the TOU clearly would understand that a licensee
is not authorized to play WoW using Glider. 
Finally, MDY claims that a dispute exists as to whether the RAM copying Blizzard
alleges here is the same as the RAM copying in MAI.  But whether the loading of software
into RAM constitutes “copying” for purposes of copyright law is a legal, not a factual,
question, and has been answered by MAI:  “[T]he loading of software into RAM creates a
copy under the Copyright Act.”  991 F.2d at 519.  MDY cites no case to the contrary.
B.
Has MDY Established the Copyright “Misuse” Defense?
The defense of copyright misuse “prevents copyright holders from leveraging their
limited monopoly to allow them control of areas outside the monopoly.”  A&M Records, Inc.
v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 1026 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Lasercomb Am., Inc. v. Reynolds,
911 F.2d 970, 979 (4th Cir. 1990)).   MDY contends that Blizzard’s prohibition of bots
constitutes copyright misuse because Blizzard is controlling its “licensees’ use of
independently created and noninfringing third party software.”  Dkt. #57 at 14.  As explained
above, however, the use of Glider does infringe Blizzard’s copyright.  Moreover, while
Blizzard has limited the license of its WoW software, there is no evidence that Blizzard has
sought to bar third parties from developing competing games.  See A&M, 239 F.3d at 1027
(rejecting misuse defense where there was no evidence plaintiffs sought to control areas
outside the grant of copyright); Triad Sys. Corp. v. S.E. Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330, 1337 (9th
Cir. 1995) (rejecting misuse defense because unlike Lasercomb, “Triad did not attempt to
prohibit [the defendant] from developing its own service software to compete with Triad”).
MDY has not established the copyright misuse defense.
C.
Does 17 U.S.C. § 117 Require a Finding of Non-infringement?

program to RAM if the copy is created as an essential step in using the program.  Section 117
provides, in relevant part: 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not infringement for the
owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of
another copy or adaption of that computer program provided[] that such a new
copy or adaption is created as an essential step in the utilization of the
computer program[.]
17 U.S.C. § 117(a)(1).
Public Knowledge’s amicus brief contends that WoW users are “owners” of copies
of the game client software within the meaning of section 117, that copying the software to
RAM is an essential step in using the game client software, and that the act of copying to
RAM is, therefore, not an infringement, even when done in connection with Glider.
Dkt. #65.  MDY adopts this argument in its reply memorandum.  Dkt. #69 at 2, 5, & n.7. 
The resolution of this issue is controlled by Ninth Circuit law.  At least three cases –
MAI, Triad, and Wall Data Inc. v. Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, 447 F.3d 769
(9th Cir. 2006) – hold that licensees of a computer program do not “own” their copy of the
program and therefore are not entitled to a section 117 defense.  See MAI, 991 F.2d at 518
n.5; Triad 64 F.3d at 1333; Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 784-85.  Wall Data provides a two-part
test for determining whether the purchaser of a copy of a software program is a licensee or
an owner:  if the copyright holder (1) makes clear that it is granting a license to the copy of
the software, and (2) imposes significant restrictions on the use or transfer of the copy, then
the transaction is a license, not a sale, and the purchaser of the copy is a licensee, not an
“owner” within the meaning of section 117.  Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 785.
In Wall Data, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department purchased nearly 4,000
licenses to Wall Data’s computer software, but installed the software on more than 6,000
computers.  Id. at 773.  The license granted a right to use the software on a “stand alone
workstation” or a “networked station which [did] not permit the [s]oftware to be shared with
other networked stations.”  Id. at 775 n.5.  The license also limited the transfer of the
software to “not more than once every 30 days.”  Id.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that
“[t]hese restrictions were sufficient to classify the transaction as a grant of a license to Wall

Data’s software, and not a sale of Wall Data’s software.”  Id. at 785.  The court therefore
concluded that “the Sheriff’s Department [was] not the ‘owner’ of copies of Wall Data’s
software for purposes of § 117.”  Id.
Under the two-part test for ownership in Wall Data, the transactions between Blizzard
and persons who acquire copies of its game client software are licenses, not sales.  
First, Blizzard makes clear that it is granting a license.  The EULA expressly states
in section 1 that Blizzard is granting a “limited license.”  Dkt. #42 at 2.  Section 3 goes
further and states that “[a]ll title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to
the Game and all copies thereof . . . are owned or licensed by Blizzard.”  Dkt. #42 at 3
(emphasis added).  The first paragraph of the EULA likewise states that “[t]his software
program and any files that are delivered to you by Blizzard . . . and any and all copies and
derivative works of such software program . . . is the copyrighted work of Blizzard[.]”
Dkt. #42 at 1 (emphasis added).  The EULA thus makes clear that Blizzard is granting to its
users a license, not ownership, of the copies of the game client software.
Second, Blizzard imposes restrictions on the transfer and use of the game client
software.  The user may transfer his “rights and obligations” under the EULA only by
transferring the original media containing the game client software along with all original
packaging and all manuals or other documentation distributed with the software; the user
must delete all copies and installations of the software from his computer; and the recipient
of the software must agree to the terms of the EULA.  Dkt. #42 at 2 (EULA § 3(B)).  As
discussed above, the TOU places additional restrictions on the use of the software.  See Dkt.
#41-8 at 4 (TOU § 4).  These restrictions are at least as severe as the restrictions in Wall
Data.  The Court concludes, therefore, that users of WoW, including those who use Glider,
are licensees of the copies of the game client software and are not entitled to the section 117
defense. 
During oral argument, counsel for MDY asserted that a person who purchases a copy
of the WoW game client software from a commercial retailer and walks out of the store with
the copy in hand certainly would not view himself as a mere licensee of what he just

purchased.  The person could dispose of the software copy as he chose, throwing it in the
trash, giving it to a friend, or installing it on his computer – all consistent with ownership.
Counsel for Blizzard responded by noting that the license is clear from notices on the box
purchased at the retailer and from a paper copy of the EULA contained in the box, as well
as from the online notices that appear when the game client software is installed on a
personal computer.  One wonders what more could be done to make clear that the purchaser
is a licensee, not an owner, of the software.  The Court also notes that a complete prohibition
on transfer of the software is not an essential requirement of a license under the Ninth
Circuit’s holding in Wall Data.  The license at issue in Wall Data did not prohibit transfer
of the software.  See Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 775 n. 5; see also Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., —
F. Supp. 2d —,  No. C07-1189RAJ, 2008 WL 2199682, at *7 (W.D. Wash. May 20, 2008)
(the license in Wall Data “imposed no limits on resale of the software”). 
MDY’s counsel also asserted at oral argument that Wall Data is distinguishable from
this case because Wall Data involved a negotiated license between the software vendor and
the software purchaser, not a standard form license like that contained in the WoW game.
MDY is mistaken.  The software used in Wall Data was purchased through an approved
vendor and was governed by “volume license booklets.”  447 F.3d at 774.  The transaction
included a “shrink-wrap license, click-through license, and volume license booklets.”  Id. at
775.  The specific license at issue was the “standard” click-through license.  Id. at 775 n.5.
The Blizzard license in this case is also a standard click-through license.
Finally, MDY urges the Court to follow the approach recently taken by the United
States District Court for the Western District of Washington in Vernor, 2008 WL 2199682.
The Vernor court declined to follow MAI, Triad, and Wall Data, and instead applied an
earlier Ninth Circuit case, United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180 (9th Cir. 1977).  Wise
involved the application of the “first sale” doctrine under 17 U.S.C. § 109 to various transfer
contracts between movie studios and recipients of movie prints.  Vernor concluded that the
critical factor in Wise for determining whether a transaction was a sale or a license was
“whether the transferee kept the copy acquired from the copyright holder.”  2008 WL

7 The Court recognizes that Vernor found the meaning of “owner” to be the same in
sections 109 and 117 and therefore found Wise and Wall Data to be incompatible.  Id at *7.
The Vernor court elected to follow the older precedent of Wise.  Id.  This Court, however,
is confronted with recent Ninth Circuit authority not only interpreting section 117, but also
explicitly declining to reconsider the rule established in MAI and Triad.  Wall Data, 447 F.3d
785 n.9.  If the Circuit’s interpretation of section 117 is to be reconsidered, it must be done
by the Circuit, not this Court.  Moreover, it is not at all clear that the result in this case would
be different even if the Court were to follow Wise.  Under Wise, a transaction is a license
where the recipient is required to the return the copy to the copyright owner or the copyright
owner retains title to the copy.  550 F.2d at 1190-92.  As noted above, section 3 of the EULA
provides that Blizzard explicitly retains title to “all copies” of the game client software.
Dkt. #42 at 3.
- 16 -
2199682, at *6.  MDY urges the Court to follow Vernor and Wise and hold that the users of
the WoW game client software are owners of the software because they are entitled to keep
the copy of the software they acquire from Blizzard.  The Court declines this invitation.
Whatever freedom the court in Vernor may have had to disregard Wall Data when applying
a different statutory provision – section 109 – this Court does not have the same freedom.
This case concerns section 117, the very provision addressed by the Ninth Circuit in Wall
Data.  The Court is not free to disregard Ninth Circuit precedent directly on point.7 
D.
Copyright Summary.
The Court reaches the following conclusions on the basis of undisputed facts,
construction of the EULA and TOU, and controlling Ninth Circuit law:  Blizzard owns a
valid copyright in the game client software, Blizzard has granted a limited license for WoW
players to use the software, use of the software with Glider falls outside the scope of the
