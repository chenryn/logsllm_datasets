User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Gmail not logging account activity It seems like Gmail isn't logging full account activity. Recently I had my online account to Paxful hacked.

Today, 11/27 at 5:07, I received an email from Paxful saying that someone requested a password reset link, and at 5:08, another saying that my password had been reset from an IP address registered to a company in Amsterdam, but showing a geolocation in Chicago (149.255.33.155), implying they had clicked on the email link. 

I then accessed my detailed Gmail recent account activity, and there were no logs of logins to my Gmail account during that time, 100% positive.

How is this possible? There's no way to reset the password outside of accessing the email. Doesn't Gmail log activity?

Assistant: Was there a log of you accessing your gmail account at that time? If so, were you actually on then? It is possible that if your computer was hacked, they may have been able to check your email automatically using your session, which would not look unusual in the logs.  As a for instance, a malicious browser extension would likely be capable of such a thing. This could also be how they found out about your Paxful account: by accessing your email directly.

Any chance your computer is the source of the compromise? I consider that much more likely than the possibility that someone accessed google without google logging it. Then again, it is hard to determine what exactly might to have happened on the basis of this very little amount of information. There are likely a number of ways this may have happened, up to and including a vulnerability in the password recovery for Paxful.
