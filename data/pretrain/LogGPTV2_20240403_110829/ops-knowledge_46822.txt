User: I have a website (which running in Amazon EC2 Instance) running Python Bottle application with CherryPy as its front end web server.
Now I need to add another website with a different domain name already registered. To reduce the cost, I want to utilize the existing website host to do that. 
Obviously, virtual host is the solution. 
I know Apache mod_wsgi could play the trick. But I don't want to replace CherryPy. 
I've googled a a lot, there are some articles showing how to make virtual hosts on CherryPy, but they all assume Cherrypy as Web Sever + Web application, Not CherrPy as Web server and Bottle as Application. 
How to use CherrPy as Web server and Bottle as Application to support multiple virtual hosts?
Assistant: perhaps you can simply put nginx as reverse proxy and configure it to send the traffic to the two domains to the right upstream (the cherryPy webserver).
