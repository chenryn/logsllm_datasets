I created a `policy.jsonl` file with the following content:
```json
{
  "user": "alice",
  "namespace": "projectCaribou"
}
```

Then, I attempted to retrieve the pods using the `kubectl` command:
```bash
$ kubectl get po --username=alice --password=password --server=https://localhost:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```

However, I encountered the following error:
```
error: couldn't read version from server: the server does not allow access to the requested resource
```

Upon further investigation, it appears that the `kubectl` command is attempting to access `https://localhost:6443/api/`, but the user "alice" only has access to resources within the `projectCaribou` namespace. Specifically, "alice" should only be able to access:
```
https://localhost:6443/api/v1/namespaces/projectCaribou
```

This discrepancy in the access scope is likely the cause of the error.
