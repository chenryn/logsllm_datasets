I created policy.jsonl
    {"user":"alice", "namespace": "projectCaribou"}
And I tried to get pods by kubectl.
    $ kubectl get po --username=alice --password=password --server=https://localhost:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
    error: couldn't read version from server: the server does not allow access to the requested resource
At first, kubectl seems to access https://localhost:6443/api/ and fail because
the "alice" can only have access on
https://localhost:6443/api/v1/namespaces/projectCaribou.
