**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Andrey Popp (@andreypopp)**

Occasionally, I find the need to write a `SELECT` statement in raw SQL and then use it as a subquery or join it with other SQLAlchemy constructs. To address this, I have developed a basic SQLAlchemy SQL construct. I am considering whether this functionality would be valuable to include in the SQLAlchemy library. While my current implementation is a quick and somewhat unrefined solution, it could be refined into a more robust and clean feature.

For reference, you can find test cases for this construct at:
