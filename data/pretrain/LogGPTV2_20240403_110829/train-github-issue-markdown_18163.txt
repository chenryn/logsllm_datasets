 **Migrated issue, originally created by Andrey Popp (@andreypopp)**
Sometimes I want to write select statement as raw SQL and then be able to do
subselects from it or join it to other sqlalchemy constructs. I wrote basic
sqlalchemy.sql construct to do that and wonder if it will be useful to have it
in sqlalchemy (of course it's quick and dirty, but could be refactored into
something more clean). See
https://github.com/andreypopp/saext/blob/master/saext/tests/test_textual.txt
for test cases.
