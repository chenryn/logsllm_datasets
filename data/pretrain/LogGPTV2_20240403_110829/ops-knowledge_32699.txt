User: Please explain how to use the thread pool for concurrency control when running server applications to avoid system crashes caused by too many requests.
Assistant: 1. Create a thread pool: first you need to create a thread pool, set the number of threads, thread queue size and other parameters. 2. Listening request: The server application needs to monitor the client's request, and when a request arrives, put it in the request queue for processing. 3. Allocate threads: Take an idle thread from the thread pool, and assign requests to this thread for processing according to the pending requests in the request queue. 4. Processing the request: After the thread gets the request, it executes the corresponding business logic and returns the result to the client. 5. Thread recycling: After processing the request, put the thread back into the thread pool to wait for the next request processing. By using the thread pool for concurrency control, the problem of system crash caused by too many requests can be effectively avoided. By setting parameters such as the number of threads and queue size, the concurrent processing capability of the system can be controlled and the stability of the system can be guaranteed. In addition, using the thread pool can also improve the concurrent processing efficiency of the system and improve the overall performance of the system.
