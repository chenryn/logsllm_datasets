## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

| Platform | Tactic | Technique | Description | Data Sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Command and Control, Defense Evasion | Connection Proxy | Strider has used local servers with both local network and Internet access to act as internal proxy nodes. This allows them to exfiltrate data from other parts of the network without direct Internet access. | Process use of network, Process monitoring, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Packet capture |
| Windows, Linux, macOS | Credential Access | Credential Dumping | Strider has registered its persistence module on domain controllers as a Windows LSA (Local Security Authority) password filter. This enables the group to dump credentials whenever a domain, local user, or administrator logs in or changes a password. | API monitoring, Process monitoring, PowerShell logs, Process command-line parameters |

### Notes:
- **Command and Control (C2):** The group uses internal proxy nodes to exfiltrate data, making it more difficult for defenders to detect and block the exfiltration.
- **Credential Dumping:** By registering as an LSA password filter, Strider can intercept and store credentials, providing long-term access to the compromised network.
