Disk 3: 2TB in capacity, divided into two partitions, Windows and Linux, 1TB each. Disk 4: 2TB in capacity, divided into a backup partition with a capacity of 2TB. When partitioning each hard disk, it is recommended to format the hard disk first in order to create a file system and partition table.
