Abstract‚ÄîCyber attackers abuse the domain name system
(DNS) to mystify their attack ecosystems; they systematically
generate a huge volume of distinct domain names to make it
infeasible for blacklisting approaches to keep up with newly
generated malicious domain names. As a solution to this problem,
we propose a system for discovering malicious domain names that
will likely be abused in future. The key idea with our system is
to exploit temporal variation patterns (TVPs) of domain names.
The TVPs of domain names include information about how and
when a domain name has been listed in legitimate/popular and/or
malicious domain name lists. On the basis of this idea, our system
actively collects DNS logs, analyzes their TVPs, and predicts
whether a given domain name will be used for malicious purposes.
Our evaluation revealed that our system can predict malicious
domain names 220 days beforehand with a true positive rate of
0.985.
I. INTRODUCTION
All Internet users and service providers use domain names
for their online activities and businesses. Domain names and
their protocol (domain name system (DNS)) are one of the
most successful examples in distributed systems that can
satisfy users‚Äô needs regarding easy use of the Internet. Cyber
attackers are also Internet users and they abuse easy-to-use
domain names as a reliable cyber attack infrastructure. For
example, in today‚Äôs cyber attacks, domain names are used in
serving malicious content or malware, controlling malware-
infected hosts, and stealing personal or important information.
As countermeasures against domain name abuses, detecting
and blacklisting known malicious domain names are basic
strategies and widely applied to protect users from cyber at-
tacks. Cyber attackers well understand these countermeasures
and abuse DNS to mystify their attack ecosystems; DNS fast-
Ô¨Çux and domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are used to
evade blacklisting. The key feature of these techniques is
that they systematically generate a huge volume of distinct
domain names. These techniques have made it
infeasible
for blacklisting approaches to keep up with newly generated
malicious domain names.
Ideally, to fully address the underlying issue with domain
name blacklists, we need to observe and track every newly
registered and updated domain name in real time and judge
whether the domain name is involved in any attackers‚Äô in-
frastructure. However, in reality, it is virtually impossible to
obtain a solution because of the following three reasons. One is
that cyber attackers use techniques, such as DNS fast-Ô¨Çux and
DGAs, to systematically generate a huge volume of distinct
domain names. The second is that the number of existing
domain names is too large to track in real time. The number of
second-level domain (2LD) names (e.g., example.com) is now
over 296 million [1]. Multiple fully qualiÔ¨Åed domain names
(FQDNs) (e.g., www.example.com) may exist under the same
2LD names; therefore, the number of all existing FQDNs could
be in the billions. The third reason is that no one can fully
understand all and real time changes in the mappings between
domain names and IP addresses. Since DNS is a distributed
system and the mappings are conÔ¨Ågured in each authoritative
name server, real-time observation of the mappings of all
domain names is infeasible.
Given these reasons, blacklisting approaches based on DNS
observations have failed to keep up with newly generated
malicious domain names. Thus, we adopt an approach of
prediction instead of observation; i.e., we aim to discover
malicious domain names that are likely to be abused in future.
The key idea of this approach is to exploit temporal variation
patterns (TVPs) of malicious domain names. The TVPs of
domain names includes the information about how and when
a domain name has been listed in legitimate/popular and/or
malicious domain name lists. We use TVPs to apprehend
the variations in domain names; e.g., a domain name is
newly registered or updated, IP addresses corresponding to
the domain name are changed, and the trafÔ¨Åc directed to the
domain name is changed.
On the basis of the aforementioned idea, we developed a
system that actively collects DNS logs, analyzes their TVPs,
and predicts whether a given domain name will be used for a
malicious purpose. Our main contributions are summarized as
follows.
‚Ä¢ We propose a system called DOMAINPROFILER that
identiÔ¨Åes TVPs of domain names to precisely proÔ¨Åle
various types of malicious domain names.
‚Ä¢ Our evaluation with real and large ground truth data
reveals that we can predict malicious domain names 220
days beforehand with a true positive rate of 0.985 in the
best-case scenario.

Fig. 1. SimpliÔ¨Åed Temporal Variation Patterns (TVPs)
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We give the
motivation of our key idea in Section II. In Section III, we
discuss our proposed system DOMAINPROFILER. We describe
the datasets we used and the results of our evaluation in
Section IV. We discuss the limitations of our system in
Section V and related work in Section VI. Finally, we conclude
our paper in Section VII.
II. MOTIVATION: TEMPORAL VARIATION PATTERN (TVP)
We deÔ¨Åne a TVP as the time-series behavior of each domain
name in various types of domain name lists. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we
identify how and when a domain name has been listed in
legitimate/popular and/or malicious domain name lists. Our
motivation for considering TVPs is based on the observation
that both legitimate and malicious domain names vary dramat-
ically in domain name lists over time. The following are three
reasons for using different and multiple domain name lists.
One is that the data are realistically observable; that is, we
can easily access the data from domain name list maintainers.
The second is that domain name lists are created based on
objective facts conÔ¨Årmed by the maintainer of those lists. The
third is that multiple domain name lists and the time-series
changes of those lists can boost the reliability of listed domain
names.
As shown in Fig. 1, our proposed system deÔ¨Ånes and
identiÔ¨Åes four TVPs (null, stable, fall, and rise) for each
domain name in a domain name list. Null means the domain
name has not been listed in the speciÔ¨Åed time window. Stable
means the domain name has been continuously listed in the
time window. Fall is a state in which the domain name was
Ô¨Årst listed then delisted during the time window. Rise means
that the domain name was Ô¨Årst unlisted then listed during the
time window.
} is an ordered Nd of
timestamps when a domain name d has been listed/contained
in a domain name list. The domain name list is collected from

between a starting point ws and ending point we, the TVP of
a domain name is deÔ¨Åned as follows.

These TVPs are common and generic features that can con-
tribute to accurately discriminating malicious domain names
controlled by attackers from legitimate domain names. Thus,
the focus of these patterns covers a wide range of malicious
domain names used in a series of cyber attacks such as
drive-by download attacks, malware downloads, command and
control (C&C), and phishing attacks.
In this paper, we use the domain names ranked in the Alexa
Top Sites [2] as the legitimate/popular domain name list. Alexa
provides the top one million popular sites based on the global
one-month average trafÔ¨Åc rank. We divide the Alexa list on
the basis of the rank to create four domain name lists, Alexa
top 1,000 (Alexa1k), Alexa top 10,000 (Alexa10k), Alexa top
100,000 (Alexa100k), and Alexa top 1,000,000 (Alexa1M). The
TVPs for the Alexa Top Sites are identiÔ¨Åed based on these
four lists. Figure 2 shows examples of typical domain names
that Ô¨Åt the four patterns in Alexa1M. The graph indicates
the relationships between domain names and their Alexa rank
variations over time (note the logarithmic y-axis). In the null
pattern of Alexa1M (Alexa1M-Null), the rank of a domain
name has always been outside 1M and has never been listed
in Alexa1M. The Alexa1M-Null pattern is intended to be one
of the features or hints to boost true positive rates, which is
the ratio of correctly predicted malicious domain names to
actual malicious domain names. This is because the rank for
legitimate domain names is more likely to be within 1M, and
new domain names by attackers cannot be in Alexa1M right
after they have registered. In the stable pattern of Alexa1M
(Alexa1M-Stable), the rank of a domain name has always been

within 1M and listed in Alexa1M. Alexa1M-Stable includes
stable popular domain names; thus, this pattern can be used for
improving true negative rates, which is the ratio of correctly
predicted legitimate domain names to actual legitimate domain
names. In the fall pattern of Alexa1M (Alexa1M-Fall), the rank
of a domain name was Ô¨Årst within 1M, fell, and Ô¨Ånally delisted
from Alexa1M. The Alexa1M-Fall pattern is intended to detect
maliciously re-registered, parked, and hijacked domain names
that changed from originally legitimate domain names to
improve true positive rates. In the rise pattern of Alexa1M
(Alexa1M-Rise), the rank of a domain name was Ô¨Årst outside
1M then increased to be within 1M. This Alexa1M-Rise
pattern includes legitimate start-up websites‚Äô domain names
during the speciÔ¨Åed time window to improve true negative
rates.
We use the domain names listed in the public blacklist
hpHosts [3] as the malicious domain name list. The hpHosts
provides malicious domain names of malicious websites en-
gaged in exploits, malware distribution, and phishing. The
TVPs for hpHosts are deÔ¨Åned in a similar way for Alexa.
Note that hpHosts does not have any continuous value, such
as ranking, and only has information of whether domain names
are listed. Figure 3 shows examples of typical domain names
that Ô¨Åt the four patterns in hpHosts. In the null pattern of
hpHosts (hpHosts-Null), a domain name has never been listed
in hpHosts. This hpHosts-Null pattern can be used for im-
proving true negative rates because legitimate domain names
are less likely to be listed in hpHosts. In the stable pattern
of hpHosts (hpHosts-Stable), a domain name has always been
listed in hpHosts. The hpHosts-Stable pattern includes domain
names related to bullet-proof hosting providers, which provide
network resources even to attackers, to improve true positive
rates. In the fall pattern of hpHosts (hpHosts-Fall), a domain
name was once listed then unlisted. For example, this pattern
includes domain names that were once abused then sanitized
to improve true negative rates. In the rise pattern of hpHosts
(hpHosts-Rise), a domain name was listed from the middle
of the speciÔ¨Åed time window. This hpHosts-Rise pattern is
intended to detect newly registered malicious domain names
that attackers will use for a while. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, many subdo-
main names can be created under the same domain name to
bypass fully qualiÔ¨Åed domain names (FQDN)-level blacklists.
Thus, the hpHosts-Rise pattern contributes to understanding
the situation to increase true positive rates.
As described above, these TVPs in both legitimate/popular
and malicious domain name lists contribute to boosting both
true positive and true negative rates. Table I summarizes the
relationships between the TVPs and their objectives. The ef-
fectiveness of using these patterns in real datasets is described
later in Section IV.
