## Abstract
Cyber attackers often exploit the domain name system (DNS) to obfuscate their attack infrastructure, generating a large number of unique domain names to evade blacklisting. To address this, we propose a system called DomainProfiler, which predicts future malicious domain names by analyzing temporal variation patterns (TVPs). TVPs capture how and when a domain name is listed in legitimate or malicious domain name lists. Our system collects DNS logs, analyzes these TVPs, and predicts whether a given domain name will be used for malicious purposes. Evaluation results show that DomainProfiler can predict malicious domain names up to 220 days in advance with a true positive rate of 0.985.

## I. Introduction
Domain names and the DNS are essential for online activities and businesses. However, cyber attackers also use domain names as a reliable infrastructure for attacks, such as serving malicious content, controlling malware-infected hosts, and stealing personal information. Traditional countermeasures, like blacklisting known malicious domain names, are often ineffective due to techniques like DNS fast-flux and domain generation algorithms (DGAs), which generate a large volume of unique domain names. This makes it infeasible for blacklisting approaches to keep up with newly generated malicious domain names.

To address this, we propose an approach based on prediction rather than observation. The key idea is to exploit the temporal variation patterns (TVPs) of domain names. TVPs include information about how and when a domain name is listed in legitimate or malicious domain name lists. By analyzing these patterns, our system can predict future malicious domain names. Our main contributions are:

- **DomainProfiler**: A system that identifies TVPs to profile various types of malicious domain names.
- **Evaluation Results**: Our system can predict malicious domain names 220 days in advance with a true positive rate of 0.985 in the best-case scenario.

## II. Motivation: Temporal Variation Patterns (TVPs)
We define a TVP as the time-series behavior of a domain name in various domain name lists. Specifically, we track how and when a domain name is listed in legitimate or malicious lists. The motivation for using TVPs is based on the observation that both legitimate and malicious domain names exhibit significant variations over time. We use different and multiple domain name lists for the following reasons:

1. **Observable Data**: Easily accessible from domain name list maintainers.
2. **Objective Facts**: Lists are created based on confirmed facts.
3. **Reliability**: Multiple lists and their time-series changes enhance the reliability of listed domain names.

Our system defines four TVPs for each domain name in a list:
- **Null**: The domain name has not been listed in the specified time window.
- **Stable**: The domain name has been continuously listed in the time window.
- **Fall**: The domain name was first listed then delisted during the time window.
- **Rise**: The domain name was first unlisted then listed during the time window.

These TVPs help accurately distinguish between malicious and legitimate domain names, covering a wide range of cyber attacks such as drive-by downloads, malware, command and control (C&C), and phishing.

## III. Our System: DomainProfiler
**DomainProfiler** identifies TVPs by collecting and analyzing DNS logs. It uses the Alexa Top Sites [2] as the legitimate/popular domain name list and the public blacklist hpHosts [3] as the malicious domain name list. The system processes these lists to identify TVPs and predict future malicious domain names.

### A. TVPs in Legitimate/Popular Domain Name List (Alexa Top Sites)
- **Alexa1M-Null**: The domain name has never been listed in the top one million.
- **Alexa1M-Stable**: The domain name has always been within the top one million.
- **Alexa1M-Fall**: The domain name was initially within the top one million but fell out.
- **Alexa1M-Rise**: The domain name was initially outside the top one million but rose into it.

### B. TVPs in Malicious Domain Name List (hpHosts)
- **hpHosts-Null**: The domain name has never been listed in hpHosts.
- **hpHosts-Stable**: The domain name has always been listed in hpHosts.
- **hpHosts-Fall**: The domain name was once listed then unlisted.
- **hpHosts-Rise**: The domain name was listed from the middle of the specified time window.

These TVPs contribute to improving both true positive and true negative rates. Table I summarizes the relationships between TVPs and their objectives.

## IV. Datasets and Evaluation
We used real and large ground truth datasets to evaluate DomainProfiler. The evaluation results show that our system can predict malicious domain names 220 days in advance with a true positive rate of 0.985 in the best-case scenario.

## V. Limitations
We discuss the limitations of our system, including potential challenges and areas for future improvement.

## VI. Related Work
We review related work in the field of domain name abuse detection and compare our approach with existing methods.

## VII. Conclusion
In conclusion, DomainProfiler effectively predicts future malicious domain names by analyzing temporal variation patterns. Our evaluation demonstrates its high accuracy and potential for practical application in cybersecurity.
