Spring's current code makes it difficult to use java collections as a command
in command controllers. Specifically, referencing elements in the collection
is prevented. Currently, elements in an collection are references using [].
Support needs to be added to allw paths to start with [index/key] as in
"[1].property".
The application for this is probably rare, which is probably why it hasn't
been brought up before (at least I couldn't find an similarly reported
issues). I use the functionality for executing multiple of the same commands.
I currently have a form that has multiple objects that can be selected. If the
user clicks "Delete" with multiple objects selected, I have an array of id's
that get passed to a delete form. This form creates a delete command for each
object specified. Details for the way the objects are deleted are stored in an
object, which is put in to a list. When the user submits the form, each
command is executed in succession (the list is actually passed to the business
layer and executed in a single transaction).
The current work around is to create a subclass of the java collection you
want and make a getter that returns this. Then you can reference the array as
(using a getter getSelf()) "self[1].property". Although this method works, a
method that doesn't require this simple extension would be preferable.
