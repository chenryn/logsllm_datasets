## Abstract
Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications have become one of the primary sources of internet traffic. The eDonkey file-sharing system and its derivatives, in particular, generate significant volumes of traffic. This report provides a measurement-based traffic profile of the eDonkey service, focusing on distinguishing non-download and download traffic. Additionally, we discuss how this type of service contributes to the "mice and elephants" phenomenon in internet traffic characteristics.

## 1. Introduction
Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications are major contributors to internet traffic. Specifically, the eDonkey2000 P2P file-sharing system and its derivatives [1, 2, 3] generate substantial traffic volumes [4]. The eDonkey system is typically used for exchanging large files, such as audio/video CDs or complete DVD images. It is highly robust and offers short download times. P2P file sharing traffic is often considered detrimental to networks due to its high volume and the transfer of very large files, which can exacerbate the "mice and elephants" phenomenon in internet traffic [5, 6]. This phenomenon describes the traffic composition, where most transfers are short (mice) and a few are long (elephants). Elephant streams can clog the network, while frequent mice may reduce throughput [7].

This paper aims to provide a detailed traffic profile for the eDonkey service, with a focus on differentiating non-download and download traffic. We also discuss the "mice and elephants" characteristic in eDonkey and the origin and destination of eDonkey flows. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the eDonkey architecture and protocol. Section 3 describes the measurement setup and results. Section 4 discusses related work on P2P behavior and traffic models. Section 5 summarizes the findings and provides a brief outlook.

## 2. The eDonkey P2P File Sharing Service
### Main Features
The eDonkey P2P file sharing application has several key features:
- It does not rely on a single central server.
- Files can be downloaded from multiple peers simultaneously.
- Files can be shared by a peer before they are fully obtained.

### Architecture and Operation
The eDonkey file sharing service is a hybrid P2P architecture consisting of two main components: the eDonkey client and the eDonkey server (Figure 1). The eDonkey client is used for sharing and downloading files, while the eDonkey server acts as an index server for file locations and distributes addresses of other servers. No files are transmitted through the server; any eDonkey user can set up a server.

### Searching and Sharing of Files
When a client connects to the eDonkey service, it logs on to a server using a TCP connection and registers all files it is willing to share. Each server maintains a list of files shared by connected clients. When a client searches for a file, it sends a query to its main server, which returns a list of matching files and their locations. If the results are insufficient, the client can resubmit the query to another server. Communication between client and server is typically via TCP on port 4661, with additional queries and results transmitted via UDP on port 4665.

### Downloading of Files
To download a file, an eDonkey client first gathers a list of potential file providers and requests an upload slot from them. Upon receiving a request, the provider places it in an upload queue. Once an upload slot is available, the provider initiates a TCP connection to the requesting client, negotiates the file chunk to be exchanged, and transmits the data. The eDonkey protocol splits files into chunks, typically 10MB each. A client can share a file as soon as it has received a complete chunk. The eDonkey client can also operate in a multiple source download mode, retrieving data in parallel from different providers.

### Server-to-Server Communications
Communication between eDonkey servers is limited. Servers periodically contact each other to announce themselves and exchange lists of other servers, maintaining an updated list of working servers and enhancing search efficiency.

## 3. eDonkey Traffic Profile
### 3.1 Measurement Setup
Measurements were conducted in August 2003 over 296 hours on a 100Mbps half-duplex FE link connecting the department to the university’s campus LAN. The university’s internet connection is a 155Mbps link to the German Research Network (DFN). The measurements were performed on the flow level using TCPdump, configured to record all TCP flows on the eDonkey client-to-client port 4662. Flows were classified semi-offline into non-download and download flows, based on the presence of specific eDonkey/eMule protocol opcodes.

### 3.2 Traffic Profile
Table 1 provides general statistics for the measured data set. Nearly 3.5 million flows were investigated, carrying 295GB of data. Only 2.24% of all connections were download connections, but they carried 70.5% of the total traffic.

#### eDonkey Flow Size
The average observed eDonkey flow size was 86KB. The average size of download streams (2.48MB) is significantly larger than that of non-download streams (16.7KB). Figure 2 shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the flow sizes. The download flow size decreases more strongly than linearly in the log/log plot, indicating a less heavy-tailed distribution. This can be attributed to the segmentation of files into chunks and the use of multiple source downloads.

#### TCP Holding Time
The average eDonkey connection holding time on the TCP level is 67.9 seconds. There is a significant difference between download and non-download flows. The mean duration of download connections is 851 seconds, much longer than the 47 seconds for non-download streams. The standard deviation of the flow duration is also much larger for download flows.

## 4. Related Work
This section discusses related work on P2P behavior and traffic models, providing context and comparison with the eDonkey traffic profile.

## 5. Summary and Outlook
This paper provides a detailed traffic profile of the eDonkey service, highlighting the distinction between non-download and download traffic. The findings suggest that eDonkey does not significantly worsen the "mice and elephants" phenomenon. Future work could include further analysis of the impact of eDonkey on network performance and the development of more efficient traffic management strategies.
