User: I am a python beginner, trying to run from power shell on vista.
when trying to call a simple script with:

python vc.py

gives error: "File "vcpy", line 1 syntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xff'
... where vc.py is:
import sys
print sys.version
It does work when I invoke instead:

cat vc.py | python

The problem with this latter approach is that it is giving us problems with the raw input function.
Assistant: It seems your file is started with Unicode BOM. Try to save your file in Utf-8 without BOM.
