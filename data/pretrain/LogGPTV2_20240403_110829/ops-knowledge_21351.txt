Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am a beginner in Python and I am trying to run a script from PowerShell on Windows Vista. When I attempt to execute a simple script using the command:

```sh
python vc.py
```

I encounter the following error:

```
File "vcpy", line 1
SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xff'
```

The `vc.py` script is as follows:

```python
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

Interestingly, the script runs without issues when I use the following command:

```sh
cat vc.py | python
```

However, this approach causes problems with the `input` function (formerly known as `raw_input` in Python 2).

**Solution:**
It appears that your file may have a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning. To resolve this issue, try saving your file in UTF-8 format without the BOM.
