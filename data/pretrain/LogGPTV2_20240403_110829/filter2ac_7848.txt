**ATT&CK ID:** T1569.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Service Execution

Adversaries may exploit the Windows Service Control Manager to execute malicious commands or payloads. The Windows Service Control Manager, managed by the `services.exe` process, provides an interface for managing and manipulating services on a system. Users can interact with the Service Control Manager through graphical user interface (GUI) components as well as command-line utilities such as `sc.exe` and `Net`.

This technique allows attackers to leverage the legitimate functionality of the Service Control Manager to execute arbitrary code, often in the context of a service, which can run with elevated privileges. By creating or modifying existing services, adversaries can ensure that their malicious code is executed at system startup or on-demand, thereby maintaining persistence and evading detection.
