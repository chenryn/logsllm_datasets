# Environment
Using two monitors, one widescreen monitor and one vertically oriented
monitor. The widescreen monitor is using a custom fancy zone layout while the
vertical monitor is using the  
"Rows" layout (see all monitor screenshot below).
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.778]
    PowerToys version: v0.16.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): Fancy Zones
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Enable 'Show zones on all monitors while dragging a window' option
  2. Drag window with secondary mouse button or shift key pressed and ~3 overlapping fancy zones appear on primary monitor, causing a few second delay before any zones become droppable
  3. Disable 'Show zones on all monitors while dragging a window' option
  4. Only one zone appears per fancy zone (expected behavior)
# Expected behavior
  * Fancy zone droppable areas will only appear once per zone
# Actual behavior
  * Multiple overlapping fancy zones appear on screen and none are selectable for several seconds
