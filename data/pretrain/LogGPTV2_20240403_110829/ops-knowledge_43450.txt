    window.location='http://'+decodeURIComponent(redir);
}


Which of the following measures would best mitigate the vulnerability present in this code?"
 "A": "Implement server-side validation of the 'redir' variable before redirection."
 "B": "Use a regular expression to whitelist specific URLs that can be assigned to 'window.location'."
