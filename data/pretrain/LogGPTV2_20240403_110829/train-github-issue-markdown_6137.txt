### Issue with the "Challenge headline-with-the-h2-element"

When I click "Run Test," I am unable to see the text of the test cases. Additionally, I can always pass the challenge, even if the code is incorrect. 

This behavior suggests that there may be a problem with the test case visibility and the validation logic. Could you please look into this?
