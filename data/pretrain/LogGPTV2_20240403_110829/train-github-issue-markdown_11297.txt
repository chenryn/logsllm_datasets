##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
Windows Transport
##### SUMMARY
Allow connectivity to Windows hosts, via Win32 OpenSSH
(https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH) opposed to WinRM.
I can see this was requested last year but was closed as it wasn't apart of
windows. Now there is a Microsoft release available (pre-prod currently).
