In traditional software development, there may be poor communication and insufficient coordination between developers and operation and maintenance personnel, resulting in slow project progress and delayed application deployment. These problems will bring many unnecessary risks and risks to software development. loss. Through the concept of DevOps, software development can be closer to user needs, developers and operation and maintenance personnel can work closely together, understand and support each other, and jointly seek faster and better solutions. This not only helps to improve the efficiency and quality of software development, but also enhances the team's cooperation ability and competitiveness, effectively reduces software development risks, and improves users' satisfaction with the software. In short, DevOps is a new software development method, emphasizing integration and collaboration, which can improve the efficiency and quality of software development, and enable the development team to better adapt to market needs and user needs, so as to achieve the successful launch and operation of software.
