...And You Still Got Owned

Let me take you back....
Step 1: Tell customer you are 31337 security professional
Customers only applied patches if it fixed something on the system 
It was common practice NOT to apply system updates that didn't fix a problem you were 
experiencing on a system (WTF ARE YOU DOING - YOU MIGHT BREAK SOMETHING!!!!!)
Step 2: Scan customer network with ISS or Nessus if you were a renegade 
Customers didn't apply patches, and rarely even had firewalls and IDSs back then
You know you only ran ISS because it had nice reports...
Step 3: Break out your uber 31337 warez and 0wn it all!!!!!
You only kept an exploit archive to save time (Hack.co.za was all you needed back then)
If you could read the screen you could 0wn the network!!!!!!!
Penetration Testing Was Easy....
If you were Ub3r 31337 you did it like this....
Port Scan & Banner Grab The Target
Get your exploit code...
Own the boxes and take screen-shots
Write The Report...               
Get Paid....                     
More Security Measures are being implemented on company networks today
Firewalls are common place (perimeter and host-based)
Anti-Virus is smarter (removes popular hacker tools, and in some cases stops buffer overflows
Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems are hard to detect let alone bypass
NAC Solutions are making their way into networks
Network/System Administrators are much more security conscious
IT Hardware/Software vendors are integrating security into their SDLC
. 
Geez...That's A Lot To Bypass
Most load-balancers are deployed for redundancy and performance improvement
As an attacker – load balancers are a headache. 
You have no idea where you packets are going....
There is absolutely no point in running tools against a host without knowing if a 
load balancer has been deployed.
So – step 1 is to determine if the host is load balanced....
Step 2 – determine what type of load balancing is in place (HTTP or DNS) 
Identifying Load Balancers
How can you tell if the target host is behind a load balancer?
Firefox LiveHTTP Headers
- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829
- Look in HTTP header for modifications such as:
1. BIGipServerOS in cookie
2. nnCoection: close
3. Cneonction: close
dig
* Look for multiple addresses resolving to one domain name
* dig google.com
Identifying Load Balancers
How can you tell if the target host is behind a load balancer?
Netcraft.com
* Look for things like "F5 BigIP"
lbd.sh
* http://ge.mine.nu/lbd.html
* sh lbd-0.1.sh targetcompany.com
halberd
* http://halberd.superadditive.com/
* halberd -v targetcompany.com
Identifying Load Balancers
Ok – so now you've figured out if you are up against a load balancer.
You've figured out if it's HTTP or DNS based load balancing and what the real IP is.
Just like there's no point in running tools against a load balanced host there is no point 
in running tools against a host that is protected by an IPS.
Sooooo...how can you tell if the target host protected an Intrusion Prevention System?
Identifying Intrusion Prevention Systems
How can you tell if the target host protected an Intrusion Prevention System?
Curl: The netcat of the web app world
http://curl.haxx.se/
curl -i http://www.targetcompany.com/../../WINNT/system32/cmd.exe?d
curl -i http://www.targetcompany.com/type+c:\winnt\repair\sam._
Look for RSTs and no response....tcpdump/wireshark is your friend ;-) 
Active Filter Detection
- http://www.purehacking.com/afd/downloads.php
- osstmm-afd -P HTTP -t targetcompany.com -v
Identifying Intrusion Prevention Systems
Ok, so you're up against an IPS – relax...there are a few other things to consider.
HINT:
Most IDS/IPS solutions don't monitor SSL encrypted (actually any encrypted) traffic.
SSL Accelerators are expensive so not everyone has one.
Identifying Intrusion Prevention Systems
Most of the time you can get around an IPS by just using encryption.
The other thing to consider is whether the IPS is in-line or out of band.
Identifying Intrusion Prevention Systems
Does the IPS monitor SSL encrypted traffic?
vi /etc/xinetd.d/ssltest
#default: off
#description: OpenSSL s_client proxy (just change the target url) 
service kerberos
{
disable = no
socket_type = stream
port = 8888
wait = no
protocol = tcp
user = root
server = /home/j0e/security/toolz/ssl_proxy.sh
only_from = 127.0.0.1
bind = 127.0.0.1
}
Identifying Intrusion Prevention Systems
Does the IPS monitor SSL encrypted traffic? (Cont.) 
vi /home/j0e/security/toolz/ssl_proxy.sh
#!/bin/bash
openssl s_client -quiet -connect www.targetcompany.com:443 2>/dev/null
Start the service
/usr/sbin/xinetd -d -f /etc/xinetd.d/ssltest &
Run AFD against localhost
osstmm-afd -v -P HTTP -t localhost -p 8888 -v
Identifying Intrusion Prevention Systems
To run scanning tools through Tor
alias hide='su -c "/home/j0e/dumbscripts/hide.sh"'
$ cat /home/j0e/dumbscripts/hide.sh 
#!/bin/bash
# Startup privoxy
/usr/sbin/privoxy /etc/privoxy/config
# Start Tor
/usr/bin/tor
$ hide
# socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork SOCKS4:127.0.0.1:targetcompany.com80,socksport=9050
Now all attacks can be launched against 127.0.0.1:8080 with Nessus or similar tool.
Attacking Through Tor
What if you don't detect any active filtering solution in place?
Can you still be missing something that messing with your traffic?
What about a WAF?
Most hosts running a WAF will show as not have an Active Filtering Solution in place by tools like AFD
Are We Forgetting Something????
How can you determine if the target host has deployed a WAF?
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829
* Look in HTTP header for modifications such as:
1. Cookie Value has WAF info in it
- BIGipServerwww.google.com_pool_http
- barra_counter_session
- WODSESSION
2. Different server response code for hostile request
- 501 Method Not Implemented
3. Different "Server" response when hostile packet is sent
Identifying Web Application Firewalls
WAFs are surprisingly easy to detect?
Generally you just have to send 1 valid request, and one malicious request and diff the response.
Malicious tends to be any HTTP request that has a payload that contains things like:
' “ < ? # 
- | ^ *
Identifying Web Application Firewalls
How can you determine if the target host has deployed a WAF?
Curl
curl -i http://targetcompany.com/cmd.exe | grep "501 Method"
Netcat
$ (echo "GET /cmd.exe HTTP/1.1"; echo "Host: targetcompany.com"; echo) | nc targetcompany.com  | grep "501 Method Not Implemented"
If the server responds with error code “501 Method Not Implemented” then it is running mod_security.
Curl
curl -i http://www.targetcompany.com/%27
HTTP/1.1 999 No Hacking
Server: WWW Server/1.1
