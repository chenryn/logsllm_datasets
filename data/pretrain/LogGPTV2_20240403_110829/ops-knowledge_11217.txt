User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Common logs are as follows
 0 14:41:58 combo rpc.idmapd startup succeeded
 1 14:41:57 combo DMA zone: 4096 pages, LIFO batch:1
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 session closed for user <*>
B: rpc.idmapd startup succeeded 和 DMA zone: <*> pages, LIFO batch:<*>
C: session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>) 和 session closed for user <*>
D: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 ALERT exited abnormally with [1]

Assistant: Answer: B
