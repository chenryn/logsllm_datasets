# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18950.1000
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.3.2142.0 (from Microsoft Store)
    Any other software?
    Not a software, but I'm using GitHub authentication with Microsoft Account.
# Steps to reproduce
I tried to use Azure CloudShell Connector, but the connector shows an error
message like below.

# Expected behavior
I think it should work normally.
# Actual behavior
I captured traffic with Fiddler4. The OAUTH API returns 400 error code like
below. The API says `AADSTS70016: Pending end-user authorization.`. I don't
know what causes the error after authentication is complete, but
authentication fails as shown in the attached screenshot.
If there are any conditions or circumstances that prevent the device from
logging in, it may be necessary to provide guidance on how to respond
appropriately.
