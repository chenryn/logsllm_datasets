**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `auditpol set` command is used to configure per-user audit policies, system audit policies, or auditing options. To perform set operations on these policies, you must have either Write or Full Control permission for the relevant object in the security descriptor, or the `Manage auditing and security log (SeSecurityPrivilege)` user right. However, the latter provides additional access that is not strictly necessary for setting audit policies.

**Syntax:**
```shell
auditpol /set
[/user[:|][/include][/exclude]]
[/category:|[,: ]]
[/success:|][/failure:|]
[/subcategory:|[,: ]]
[/success:|][/failure:|]
[/option: /value: |]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/user**: Specifies the security principal (by SID or name) for whom the per-user audit policy is being set. Either the `/category` or `/subcategory` option must be specified.
  - **/include**: Indicates that the user's per-user policy will generate an audit even if it is not specified by the system audit policy. This is the default behavior.
  - **/exclude**: Indicates that the user's per-user policy will suppress audits regardless of the system audit policy. This setting is ignored for users who are members of the local Administrators group.

- **/category**: Specifies one or more audit categories by GUID or name. If no user is specified, the system policy is set.

- **/subcategory**: Specifies one or more audit subcategories by GUID or name. If no user is specified, the system policy is set.

- **/success**: Enables success auditing. This is the default behavior if neither `/success` nor `/failure` is explicitly specified.

- **/failure**: Enables failure auditing. This must be used with a parameter indicating whether to enable or disable the setting.

- **/option**: Sets the audit policy for specific options such as `CrashOnAuditFail`, `FullprivilegeAuditing`, `AuditBaseObjects`, or `AuditBasedirectories`.

- **/sd**: Sets the security descriptor used to delegate access to the audit policy. The security descriptor must be specified using Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) and must include a discretionary access control list (DACL).

- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

1. **Set the per-user audit policy for all subcategories under the "Detailed Tracking" category for the user `mikedan` to audit all successful attempts:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /set /user:mikedan /category:detailed Tracking /include /success:enable
   ```

2. **Set the per-user audit policy for categories specified by name and GUID, and subcategories specified by GUID to suppress auditing for any successful or failed attempts:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /set /user:mikedan /exclude /category:Object Access,System,{6997984b-797a-11d9-bed3-505054503030} /subcategory:{0ccee9210-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030},{0ccee9211-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030} /success:enable /failure:enable
   ```

3. **Set the per-user audit policy for the specified user for all categories to suppress auditing of all but successful attempts:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /set /user:mikedan /exclude /category:* /success:enable
   ```

4. **Set the system audit policy for all subcategories under the "Detailed Tracking" category to include auditing for only successful attempts:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /set /category:detailed Tracking /success:enable
   ```
   **Note:** The failure setting is not altered.

5. **Set the system audit policy for the "Object Access" and "System" categories and subcategories specified by GUIDs to suppress failed attempts and audit successful attempts:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /set /subcategory:{0ccee9210-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030},{0ccee9211-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030} /failure:disable /success:enable
   ```

6. **Set the auditing options to the enabled state for the `CrashOnAuditFail` option:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /set /option:CrashOnAuditFail /value:enable
   ```
