User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is using Basic Authentication in an iOS App safe? I am working on an iOS app that will be sending the user's username and password for each URL request. Currently, only because for simplicity until it's ready to be launched, the username and password is being passed over HTTPS in a GET request like the below.

https://www.example.com/api/login.php?username=user&amp;password=pass


The HTTPS secures the parameters for transmission, but I know that the security concern with this is that the URL can be stored in browser history and any server logs.

My question is... if I get rid of passing the username and password like I currently am doing and I base64 encode them prior to being sent, include them in the header like below, is this safe? Will the username and password be stored in any history or logs?

Authorization: Basic aHR0cHdhdGNoOmY=


EDIT: I already know base64 can easily be reversed... that's not what I'm asking about. I'm just asking about the security of putting usernames and passwords in HTTPS GET parameters vs. the header.

UPDATE: I am now using basic authentication for the login endpoint and returning a JSON Web Token to be used for all requests thereafter.

Assistant: Will the username and password be stored in any history or logs?


Commonly authorization headers are not logged but, of course, one could configure the application or server to log these data. Thus check your setup. 

As for storing in the history: In case of a browser, such credentials will not be stored in the history but might be stored similar to cookies and automatically sent when visiting the site. Yet, since you are not using a browser but your own app, it is up to you how you manage this information.
