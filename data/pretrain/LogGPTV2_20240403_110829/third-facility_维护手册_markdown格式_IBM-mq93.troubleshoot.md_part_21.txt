Managed File Transfer commands, Ant tasks, and log messages provide return codes to indicate whether
functions have successfully completed.
What to do if your MFT agent is not listed by the fteListAgents command
If your agent is not listed by the fteListAgents command or is not displayed in the IBM MQ Explorer,
or your file transfers are not displayed in the Transfer Log of the IBM MQ Explorer, you can carry out a
number of problem determination steps to investigate the cause.
Use the following flowchart to help you to diagnose problems and decide what action to take next:
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 131
Flowchart key:
1.For more information about how to check the user ID that is presented, see “Examining messages
before publication” on page 170. User IDs must conform to the MQ user name 12 character limit.
If a user name is longer than 12 characters (Administrator, for example) the user name will be
truncated before being checked for authorisation. In an example using Administrator, the following
error message is added to the queue manager error log:
AMQ8075: Authorization failed because the SID for entity 'administrato' cannot be obtained.
2.For more information about the authority needed for the SYSTEM.FTE queue, see Authority to publish
MFT Agents log and status messages.
What to do if an agent is shown as being in an UNKNOWN state
Your agent is running and responds successfully to the ftePingAgent command, and items are being
transferred normally. However, the fteListAgents and fteShowAgentDetails commands, and the
IBM MQ Explorer Managed File Transfer plug-in, report the agent as being in an UNKNOWN state.
Why this problem occurs
Periodically, each agent publishes its status to the SYSTEM.FTE topic on the coordination queue manager.
The frequency that an agent publishes its status is controlled by the following agent properties:
agentStatusPublishRateLimit
The maximum rate, in seconds, that the agent republishes its status because of a change in file
transfer status. The default value of this property is 30 seconds.
agentStatusPublishRateMin
The minimum rate, in seconds, that the agent publishes its status. This value must be greater than
or equal to the value of the agentStatusPublishRateLimit property. The default value for the
agentStatusPublishRateMin property is 300 seconds (or 5 minutes).
The fteListAgents and fteShowAgentDetails commands, and the IBM MQ Explorer Managed File
Transfer ( MFT) plug-in, use these publications to determine the status of an agent. In order to do this, the
commands and the plug-in perform the following steps:
1.Connect to the coordination queue manager.
2.Subscribe to the SYSTEM.FTE topic.
3.Receive agent status publications.
4.Create a temporary queue on the coordination queue manager.
5.Put a message to the temporary queue, and save the put time in order to get the current time on the
coordination queue manager system.
6.Close the temporary queue.
7.Use the information contained within the publications, and the current time, to determine the status of
an agent.
8.Disconnect from the coordination queue manager.
The status message of an agent is considered stale if the difference between the time that
it was published, and the current time, is greater than: The value of the agent property
agentStatusPublishRateMin (included in the status message) plus the value of the advanced
coordination queue manager property agentStatusJitterTolerance.
By default, the agentStatusJitterTolerance property has a value of 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds).
If the agentStatusPublishRateMin and agentStatusJitterTolerance properties are set to their
default values, then the status of an agent is considered stale if the difference between the time that it
was published, and the current time, is greater than 303 seconds (or 5 minutes 3 seconds).
Any agent with a stale status message is reported by the fteListAgents and fteShowAgentDetails
commands, and the IBM MQ Explorer MFT plug-in, as being in an UNKNOWN state.
132 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
The status publication of an agent can be stale for one of the following reasons:
1.There is a significant difference in the system time between the system where the agent queue
manager is running, and the system where the coordination queue manager is located.
2.The channels between the agent queue manager and the coordination queue manager are stopped
(which prevents new status messages from reaching the coordination queue manager).
3.An authorization issue is preventing the agent from publishing its status to the SYSTEM.FTE topic on
the coordination queue manager.
4.An agent failure has occurred.
Troubleshooting the problem
There are a number of steps to take to determine why the status of an agent is being reported as
UNKNOWN:
1.Check whether the agent is running, by logging on to the agent system. If the agent is stopped, then
investigate why it is no longer running. Once it is running again, check whether its status is now being
reported correctly.
2.Check that the coordination queue manager is running. If it is not, restart it and then use the
fteListAgents or fteShowAgentDetails command, or the IBM MQ Explorer MFT plug-in, to see if
the agent status is now being reported correctly.
3.If the agent and the coordination queue managers are running, check the value of the Status Age value
for the agent in the fteListAgents output or the IBM MQ Explorer MFT plug-in.
This value shows the difference between the time that the status message of the agent was published,
and the time that the status message was processed.
If the difference is:
• Always slightly higher than the value of the agent property agentStatusPublishRateMin
(included in the status message) plus the value of the advanced coordination queue
manager property agentStatusJitterTolerance , consider increasing the value of the
agentStatusJitterTolerance property. This introduces a slight tolerance to allow for a delay in
between the status publications being received and processed, as well as allowing for a difference in
the system clocks between the agent queue manager and the coordination queue manager systems.
• More than 10 minutes higher than the value of the agent property agentStatusPublishRateMin
(included in the status message) plus the value of the advanced coordination queue manager property
agentStatusJitterTolerance, and continues to increase each time the status of the agent is
checked, then the status messages from the agent are not reaching the coordination queue manager.
In this situation, the first thing to do is check the error logs for the agent queue manager and the
coordination queue manager to see if there are any authorization issues that are preventing the
agent from publishing its status messages. If the logs show that authorization issues are occurring,
then ensure that the user running the agent process has the correct authority to publish messages to
the SYSTEM.FTE topic on the coordination queue manager.
If the error logs of the queue manager do not report any authorization issues, check that thestatus
messages have not got stuck in the IBM MQ network. Verify that all of the sender and receiver
channels that are used to route the messages from the agent queue manager to the coordination
queue manager are running.
If the channels are running, then check the transmission queues associated with the channels, to
make sure that the status messages are not stuck on them. Also, you should check any dead letter
queues for the queue managers to make sure that the status messages have not been placed there
for some reason.
4.If the channels are running, and the status messages are flowing through the IBM MQ network, then
the next thing to check is that the queue manager’s queued publish/subscribe engine is picking up the
messages.
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 133
The fteSetupCoordination command, which is used to define the coordination queue manager,
provides you with some MQSC commands that must be run on the coordination queue manager to
configure the queued publish/subscribe engine to receive publications. These commands perform the
following steps:
• Create the SYSTEM.FTE topic and its associated topic string.
• Define a local queue called SYSTEM.FTE that will be used to receive incoming status messages.
• Enable the queued publish/subscribe engine, by setting the PSMODE attribute on the queue manager
to ENABLED.
• Modify the SYSTEM.QPUBSUB.QUEUE.NAMELIST namelist, which is used by the queued publish/
