  * Electron version:  
Electron 1.3.0
  * Operating system:  
Windows 7 - Windows 10
Issue:  
After the new so far not officially released Brave version has included that
update towards Electron 1.3.0 there are rendering glitches/tearing effects
when scrolling down with deactivated hardware acceleration. There are also
some when activating it, but so far deactivating hardware acceleration has
removed that white lines/glitches/tearings when scrolling.
This is no longer the case after that update to Electron 1.3.0
Can be avoided in other Chromium based browsers that deactivating smooth
scrolling is used, which is missing in Electron. You plan to add that option?
Problem is that Google will also remove that feature at one point from the
flags, could you find a way to keep that in Electron somehow then?
