# Environment
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.418]
# Steps to reproduce
Open windows terminal and move it with cursor to a new screen in a dual screen
setup. Specifically from a 4k to 1080p monitor.
# Expected behavior
The windows terminal window should move to the other screen.
# Actual behavior
The window when moved to the other screen freezes and then crashes.
Note: It works if the windows terminal window starts and is maximised on the
first monitor and then is win+shift+arrowed to the other monitor. No crash but
if it is not maximized and either moved by way of win+shift+arrows OR cursor
drag then it crashes.
