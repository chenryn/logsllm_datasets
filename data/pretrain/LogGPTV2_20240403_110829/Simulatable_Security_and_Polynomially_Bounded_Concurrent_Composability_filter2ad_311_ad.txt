### Consideration of Adversaries and Security Proofs

We consider a dummy adversary, which simply follows all instructions received from the honest user. To prove that \(\hat{M}_1^p\) is as secure as \(\hat{M}_2^p\) under the assumption that \(\hat{M}_1\) is as secure as \(\hat{M}_2\), we introduce a simulator \(S\) for the dummy adversary attacking the single protocol. Given the assumption of universal security, \(S\) does not depend on the honest user.

For each honest user \(H^*\) in the composed protocol \(\hat{M}_1^p\), we construct a new honest user \(H_p\) for a single copy of \(\hat{M}_1\). \(H_p\) simulates \(H^*\) by performing one of the following for each copy of the protocol:
1. Simulate the real protocol and the real (dummy) adversary (a "real copy").
2. Simulate the ideal protocol and the simulator \(S\) (an "ideal copy").
3. Reroute communication from \(H^*\) to the outside of \(H_p\), where either a real or an ideal protocol instance resides (an "external copy").

The number of "real" and "ideal" copies is chosen randomly, with exactly one "external copy." If \(H_p\) chooses to simulate \(l\) "real copies" and runs with the real protocol, this is equivalent to \(H_p\) choosing to simulate \(l + 1\) "real copies" and running with the ideal protocol and simulator \(S\). By the security assumption of a single protocol copy, these scenarios are indistinguishable. This chain of indistinguishable views extends from \(H_p\) simulating 0 "real copies" to \(H_p\) simulating \(p\) "real copies," making these two settings indistinguishable to the simulated \(H^*\).

### Standard Security and Mutual Dependency

When considering standard security, a problem arises: the simulator \(S\) must be a "good" simulator for \(H_p\), but for standard security, such a "good" \(S\) would depend on \(H_p\), which in turn depends on \(S\). This mutual dependency may not have a fixpoint, as demonstrated in a counterexample in Section 3 for the computational case.

### Polynomially Bounded Concurrent Composition Theorem

To address this, we present a theorem for polynomially bounded concurrent composition:

**Theorem 4.2 (Polynomially Bounded Concurrent Composition Theorem):**
Let \(\hat{M}_1\) and \(\hat{M}_2\) be protocols such that \(\hat{M}_1\) is as secure as \(\hat{M}_2\) (with respect to standard statistical security as in Definition 4.1). Let \(p\) be a polynomial. Then, \(\hat{M}_1^p\) is as secure as \(\hat{M}_2^p\), where \(\hat{M}_i^p\) denotes the polynomially bounded concurrent composability as in Definition 2.1. This also holds when the honest user has access to an auxiliary input.

**Proof Sketch:**
Given an honest user \(H^*\) for the composed protocol \(\hat{M}_1^p\), we construct honest users \(H_i\) for the single protocol \(\hat{M}_1\). Each \(H_i\) chooses a random number \(l\) and simulates \(l - 1\) "ideal copies" with session IDs \(1, \ldots, l - 1\), one "external copy" with session ID \(l\), and \(p(k) - l - 1\) "real copies" with session IDs \(l + 1, \ldots, p(k)\).

Key differences from the previous construction:
- \(H_i\) chooses \(l \in \{1, \ldots, i - 1\}\).
- The number \(l\) is chosen with a fixed distribution, ensuring any \(l\) has a probability whose inverse is polynomial in \(l\). If \(l \geq i\), \(H_i\) aborts.
- The "ideal copies" do not all contain the same simulator; instead, each "ideal copy" with session ID \(sid\) has a simulator \(S_{sid}\) defined in dependence of \(H_{sid}\).

By constructing a common simulator \(S_\infty\) for all \(H_i\), we ensure that the statistical distance between the views of \(H^*\) in the real and ideal models is negligible. This proof holds for arbitrary \(H^*\), establishing that \(\hat{M}_1^p\) is as secure as \(\hat{M}_2^p\).

### Perfect Case

The proof can be modified to show concurrent composition in the perfect security case, where the views of the honest user must be identical. Using results from [29], which show that standard and universal security coincide in the perfect case, we get:

**Theorem 4.3 (Polynomially Bounded Concurrent Composition Theorem, perfect case):**
The Polynomially Bounded Concurrent Composition Theorem 4.2 also holds in the case of perfect standard security.

### Conclusions

Composability properties of simulatable security are crucial for modular protocol design and analysis. We have shown that computational standard simulatability does not imply polynomially bounded concurrent composability, which has practical implications for cryptographic protocol constructions. In the statistical case, polynomially bounded concurrent composability is guaranteed by standard simulatability, but we recommend using universal or black-box simulatability due to their efficiency and stronger guarantees.
