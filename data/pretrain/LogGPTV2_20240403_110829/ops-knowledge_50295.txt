User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to safely mirror network traffic for audit reasons? We have an internet connection that we need to audit: 

INTERNET -&gt;&gt; ROUTER -&gt;&gt; CLIENTS


our idea would be to put a (enough big) HUB before the router (router, that logs in via pppoe to the ISP) and on that HUB put an OpenBSD* machine too: 

INTERNET -&gt;&gt; HUB -&gt;&gt; ROUTER -&gt;&gt; CLIENTS


*I want to run a: 

tcpdump -i em0 -w out.pcap


on the OpenBSD machine (em0 is the interface plugged in to the HUB, -no IP address needed for that interface?). I choosed OpenBSD since it has a history regarding security, so if there is an attacker, it wont go in via tcpdump, since tcpdump could have vulnerabilities, and it listens on the interface. 

My question: is this the perfect solution? (no, I don't trust proprietary HW that can do "port mirroring")

UPDATE: We don't want to put an iptables rule in the router to send all traffic to a logserver.

Assistant: In theory your solution should work just fine at a basic level with a caveat. You'll need to find a hub that works at the speed of your Internet connection or greater.  Depending on the speed of your Internet connection that might be tricky, especially has hubs are getting harder to find.

I guess a question is why you don't trust dedicated port mirroring hardware, as that would be the standard way of doing this.  Either setting a port on a switch to be mirrored, or using a network tap
