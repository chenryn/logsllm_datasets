**Current behavior**
When a directive is attached to the DOM via @HostBinding decorator, it seems
to not be active.
    import { Component, Directive, ElementRef, HostBinding } from '@angular/core';
    @Directive({
      selector: '[ui-color]',
    })
    export class ColorDirective  {
      constructor(el: ElementRef) {
        el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
      }
    }
    @Component({
      selector: 'test-cmp',
      template: `Should be red`,
    })
    export class TestComponent {
      @HostBinding('attr.ui-color') color = '';
    }
    @Component({
      selector: 'my-app',
      template: `
        Should be red
      `,
    })
    export class AppComponent {}
    //Two text lines should be red
The problem is also reproduced with modules: angular/flex-layout#76
**Expected behavior**
Directive should be active when injected via @HostBinding decorator.
