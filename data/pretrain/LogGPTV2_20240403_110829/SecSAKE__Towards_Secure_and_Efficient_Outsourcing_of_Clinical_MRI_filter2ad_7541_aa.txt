ABSTRACT
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used technique
to help form images of internal body structures for medical diag-
nosis. Recently, the Simultaneous Auto-calibrating and K-space
Estimation (SAKE) becomes one of the most popular rapid imaging
reconstruction methods to restore key information from scanned
MRI data. This technique intrinsically requires a fair amount of
high-resolution MRI data to accommodate the need of accurate
diagnosis and imposes vast computational overhead onto resource-
constrained clinics. To solve this problem, the practitioners start
seeking the help of cloud computing platform to utilize its robust
and economical computation power. However, the privacy concerns
with outsourcing patients’ private data to public cloud servers are
ignited and hinder those practitioners from enjoying the benefits
of cloud computing.
Motivated by this practical need, we investigate the privacy re-
quirements of MRI data and reconstruction process and propose
the first secure and efficient clinical MRI reconstruction outsourc-
ing scheme, SecSAKE. Our solution enables a clinic to outsource
the most computationally-intensive tasks in SAKE to the resource-
abundant cloud servers. In particular, two different protocols are
put forward in SecSAKE, with extra emphasis on security and ef-
ficiency, respectively. In the first protocol, we carefully enforce a
low-complexity matrix transformation in the k-space domain on
the clinic end and harness the cloud server to perform iterative
computation tasks. The corresponding security analysis shows that
the outsourced MRI data are computationally indistinguishable
under Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA). In the second protocol, we
largely reduce the computational complexity on the clinic side by
leveraging a multi-server architecture of the cloud. The clinic only
needs to perform a one-round data transformation to retrieve the
reconstructed MRI data. Moreover, we conduct thorough privacy
and efficiency analysis and extensive experiments over real-world

1 INTRODUCTION
The technique of MRI has shown its superiority over other med-
ical imaging techniques such as CT, since the patient can avoid
exposing himself to ionizing radiation. Restricted by physical and
physiological constraints, the data acquisition phase of MRI usually
lasts quite long, which results in the patient’s restlessness and then
leads to nondiagnostic images [17]. Such procedure has already
been accelerated by a well-established undersampling technique,
called parallel imaging. Multiple receiver coils are concurrently
applied in the scanning phase, each collecting undersampled data
in the spatial frequency domain, i.e. k-space domain. The clinic
can then recover the desired image based on the acquired data and
a particular reconstruction algorithm after the patient leaves the
scanners. However, the reconstruction usually takes quite a long
period, which may impact the prompt medical treatment. A re-
cently proposed reconstruction approach, called SAKE [26], retains
the superiority of removing aliasing artifacts in dynamic MRI over
other mainstream approaches, such as SENSE [21] and SPIRiT [18].
Nonetheless, its time cost for reconstruction can still be overdue in
the urgent diagnostic case, mainly owing to the 1) expensive com-
putation complexity, 2) large-scale imaging data and 3) constrained
clinical computing capability.
In the past decade, cloud computing has been widely recognized
as an economical and practical solution for resource-limited data
owner to compute computational-intensive tasks. However, sim-
ply outsourcing the original data to the cloud server will bring
about many data privacy challenges. Specifically, exposing the im-
ages produced by an MRI scan may reveal the patient’s identity
and physical condition. Besides, the cloud server may also fail to

putational resources) or internal/external attacks, both of which
will seriously compromise the diagnostic timeliness. Accordingly, a
fine-grained outsourcing protocol addressing all the above security
challenges while preserving the computational functionalities is
highly demanded in practice. Additionally, the protocol should not
impose heavy computational overhead to the data owner, or else it
is contrary to the original intention of outsourcing.
In this paper, we propose SecSAKE, a secure outsourcing scheme
enabling the clinic to efficiently recover the missing entries in the
undersampled k-space based on SAKE [26]. As far as we know, this
is the first work on investigating the problem of secure processing
of MRI image reconstruction by leveraging the cloud computing
service. In [26], the computation paradigm of SAKE is essentially
formulated as the low-rank matrix completion problem, i.e. a mathe-
matical optimization problem that can be iteratively solved by the
well-established Cadzow’s algorithm [2, 10]. Unlike other common
optimization problems, such as linear programming, this paradigm
contains constraints in an uncommon form. This raises the chal-
lenge that the privacy and functionalities cannot be simultaneously
preserved by exclusively applying the affine transformation to the
original problem, like the methods proposed in [27].
We advance our first protocol, named SecSAKE I, to address this
challenge. Inspired by the Cadzow’s algorithm [2, 10], we can al-
ternatively outsource some of the expensive sub-tasks, which are
decomposed from the steps of solving this optimization problem.
The primary sub-task that we focus on is singular value decompo-
sition (SVD) over the complex field. In particular, the imaging data
is masked by random unitary matrices by the data owner before
it can securely harness the cloud server to run the iterative com-
putation. Additionally, we consider data consistency projection as
another resource-intensive sub-task in the case of non-Cartesian
Sampling. Computing this sub-task requires the information of sam-
pling mechanism, which the data owner may not want to reveal
in some cases. SecSAKE I enables the data owner to conceal the
sampling mechanism according to his preference. By a low-cost
transformation, this sub-task can also be securely outsourced to
the cloud server. In total, the required operations that the data
owner performs in each iteration are of quadratic time complexity.
Meanwhile, the data protected by SecSAKE I is computationally in-
distinguishable under chosen plaintext attack and verifiable against
malicious cloud servers.
A noticeable issue of SecSAKE I is that the clinic has to stay
online and participate in each iteration. Aiming to minimize its ad-
verse effect, we propose another protocol SecSAKE II. In particular,
we adopt the system architecture of multiple cloud servers. The
data owner only needs to execute one round of data transformation
in SecSAKE I at first. Then it can allocate the transformed data, key
matrices, and different shares of imaging data to different servers.
The servers can jointly process the iterations without the interven-
tion of the data owner. Finally, the data owner can transform the
obtained data from the cloud server to finalize the reconstruction,
while none of the cloud servers can reveal the real imaging data.
Altogether, the contributions in this paper can be summarized
as follows:
• For the first time in the literature, we formalize the prob-
lem of outsourcing the process of MRI reconstruction, i.e.
low-rank matrix completion, to the cloud. Accordingly, we
develop two secure and efficient solutions, SecSAKE I and
SecSAKE II, addressing the issue of security and efficiency,
respectively.
• In our first protocol, both imaging data and sampling mecha-
nism are well protected as computationally indistinguishable
under chosen plaintext attack. The data owner can detect
the misbehaviors of the malicious cloud server while only
performing computations with quadratic time complexity
in total, which is much lower than performing the original
computations locally.
• In our second protocol, the data owner only needs to com-
municate with all the cloud servers by once and then it can
receive the reconstructed k-space data. We also prove that
the imaging data can be well protected when none of the
semi-honest cloud servers can collude with each other.
• We implement and evaluate our design through the exper-
iments over real-world image benchmark. It is shown that
both of the protocols can be practically efficient and be well
applied to clinical diagnose.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the procedures
of image reconstruction in SAKE is given in Section 2. Section 3
provides the system architecture and threat model of SecSAKE,
along with the design goals of our system. Section 4 and 5 propose
the system design of our single-server and multi-server protocols,
respectively. In Section 6 and 7, we analyze the privacy and computa-
tional complexity of both protocols. We demonstrate our extensive
experiment in Section 8, organize the related works in Section 9
and conclude this paper in Section 10.
2 PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Simultaneous Auto-calibrating and K-space
Estimation
Before we formally present its problem formulation, we briefly and
separately describe the main procedures of SAKE and the involved
computations in sequence:
Generating Data Matrix: In this phase, the data acquired from the
multiple coils is integrated into the single data matrix A. Initially, all
the vacant entries in coils are filled with zeros. After that, a square
sliding window with the chosen size of w ×w moves across the data
within an Nx × Ny coil. Each value in the window is then projected
to a row vector, which is later attached to the data matrix. The
above operations are repeated over each of the Nc coils. Hence, the
Nc×(Nx −w +1)(Ny−w +1)
constructed data matrix will contain w
entries. Specifically, the linear operator to generate the data matrix
A is defined as Hw :
Hw : CNx×Ny ·Nc → C(Nx−w +1)(Ny−w +1)×w 2Nc
(1)
As shown in Figure 1, the generated data matrix contains many
duplicate entries, i.e. the same entry in k-space dataset is anti-
diagonally projected to a set of indexes in A. In particular, the data
matrix is structured as a Hankel structure1 in terms of blocks. It has

Session 13: Privacy 2ASIACCS’18, June 4–8, 2018, Incheon, Republic of Korea538been shown in [26] that the data matrix, created with an appropriate
window size, should have the property of low rankness if generated
from a fully sampled k-space dataset.
Low-rankness Projection: The objective in this stage is to separate
the desired data and noise by projecting the data matrix onto a more
compact subspace. The Cadzow’s algorithm [2] adopted in SAKE
proposes to apply the technique based on SVD in order to enforce
the low-rankness of data matrix. As observed in [26], the rank of
the data matrix A is highly dependent on the type of scanned object
and coil configuration. This indirectly implies that the rank (A) can
be approximately estimated before the image reconstruction. In
this paper, we all suppose Nc , w ≪ Nx , Ny. Denote p = (Nx − w +
Nc and ∗ as the conjugate transpose. First,

n(cid:88)
the data matrix can be uniquely decomposed as
(2)
where ui ∈ Cp×1 and vi ∈ Cq×1 are left and right singular vectors
of A which correspond to the singular value σi. If the singular
values are given in a descending order, the least squares estimate
of the desired signal with rank ˆr is given in a truncated version:

Structural Consistency Projection: Correspondingly, a reverse
operator of Hw which projects the data matrix back to multi-coil
k-space data is also defined as H
†
w : C(Nx−w +1)(Ny−w +1)×w 2Nc → CNx×Ny ·Nc
(4)
This process is shown in Figure 1. Note that the inputting data
matrix, denoted by ˆA, may not be structured as a block-wise Hankel
†
matrix. Alternatively, H
w obtains the values of the entries on the
anti-diagonal direction and then projects their average values onto
a particular entry of the k-space dataset.
Data Consistency Projection: Let xn be the current estimate of
†
the k-space data given by xn = H
w ( ˆA). The entries at the sampled
locations now contain different values from the original ones. More
precisely, denote y as the chained raw k-space data that is acquired
from the multiple coils, with the size of Nx × Ny · Nc. Given the
linear operator D which only selects the sampled locations, the data
consistency can be achieved by a least square solution to Dxn = y:
(5)
where the pseudo-inverse of D, represented as D†, serves for vec-
torizing the chained data and filling vacant entries with zeros.
According to the above definitions and notations, the low-rank
matrix completion problem formulated in SAKE [26] can be ex-
pressed as follows:
