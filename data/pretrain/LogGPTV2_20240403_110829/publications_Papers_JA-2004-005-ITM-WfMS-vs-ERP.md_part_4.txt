**Integration of Research in Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) and Web Services**

The issues relevant to WfMSs also apply to the domain of Web Services. Therefore, better integration of research in these two areas, through joint research teams or other collaborative mechanisms, is essential. This is particularly true for Web Services, which represent a fundamentally different paradigm for acquiring, developing, and maintaining information systems.

**Education and Curriculum Needs**

A similar argument can be made for the educational landscape. While some process mapping is covered in system development classes, it is often limited. Workflow technology and business process definition are not thoroughly addressed in required Information Systems (IS) courses at most universities. Workflow technology may be briefly covered in Groupware or Decision Support Systems electives. Conversely, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are extensively discussed in IS required courses, with many schools offering one or two complete courses dedicated to ERP systems. Given the importance of workflow technology, especially in the context of Web Services, there is a need for more comprehensive coverage of business process definition and workflow technology in the IS curriculum. Additionally, Computer Science curricula should place greater emphasis on ERP systems and their relationship with WfMSs.

### Conclusions

We have conceptualized three distinct types of business process applications:
1. **Workflows Involving Humans**
2. **Workflows Involving Systems and Applications**
3. **Transactional Workflows**

These categories help illustrate the differences between WfMSs and ERP systems. Most WfMSs address all three types of workflows, while ERP systems primarily focus on transactional workflows. WfMSs are more suitable for modeling workflows involving humans and software systems (Types 1 and 2), especially when these systems are autonomous and heterogeneous. ERP systems, on the other hand, are more appropriate for modeling transactional workflows. However, when transactional workflows involve heterogeneous systems, a WfMS may be a more suitable solution due to the reliance of ERP systems on a common, homogeneous, and interoperable data infrastructure.

Thus, organizations may require either ERP or WfMS systems, or both, depending on their specific needs. WfMSs are geared towards process management, integrating applications and data from heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed systems. They generally exhibit domain independence, meaning they can be implemented across various business sectors. In contrast, ERP systems are data-centric, focusing on information management and data integration, and are typically domain-dependent, providing business templates for specific functional and market sectors.

ERP systems are well-suited for departmental, organizational, and cross-organizational scopes, operating on a national or international scale, where there is a good fit between desired organizational processes and those embedded in ERP applications. These systems are built from prefabricated applications. Both WfMSs and ERP systems play a crucial role in application integration within organizations. As discussed in Section 3, these systems can be used independently or together to address intra- and inter-organizational application integration. Current trends in application integration point to the architectures depicted in Figure 3, where flow logic is captured in WfMSs, and function logic is found in ERP systems, other applications, or other WfMSs.

### Intra- and Inter-Enterprise Integration

In the intra-organizational area, we see this represented by the moves of ERP vendors to integrate WfMSs into their ERP architectures and the emergence of EAI/BPM workflow-based tools. The diagram below illustrates the use of WfMSs and ERP systems for intra- and inter-enterprise integration.

As noted in this paper, a solution to enterprise (intra-organization) and e-Commerce (inter-organization) application integration is the use of workflow technology in conjunction with the architecture provided by Web Services. This combination enables the orchestration of Web Services and allows any two Web applications to communicate using standard interfaces. Historically, ERP customers have been locked into proprietary interfaces, but the emerging trend of decoupling the flow logic of ERP applications to enable them as Web services will continue to grow.

This paper provides a holistic view of ERP and WfMS systems by outlining key differences and similarities, describing their most applicable domains, and explaining how these technologies are being combined to address business process improvement and integration. The analysis was limited by the lack of empirical research data, necessitating reliance on case studies, stories, and analyses from practitioner literature. To address this limitation, an extensive literature review was conducted to provide the most complete and accurate comparison of these systems.

The paper began with the observation that there are different camps in both business and academic organizations dealing with ERP and WfMS systems. We hope this paper will stimulate dialogue and integration between these two technology camps.
