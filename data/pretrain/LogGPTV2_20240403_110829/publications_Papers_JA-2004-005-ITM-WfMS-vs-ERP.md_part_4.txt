Since these issues are also applicable to WfMSs, better integration of research in these two areas,
via joint research teams or other mechanisms, is needed. This is especially true in the Web
Services area where we are looking at a totally different paradigm for acquiring, developing, and
maintaining information systems.
15
A similar argument can be made for education. Although one will find some process mapping
in system development classes, it is limited. Workflow technology and business process
definition are not covered in depth in IS required classes in most universities. Workflow
technology may be covered briefly in Groupware or Decision Support Systems electives. On the
other hand, ERP systems are discussed in most IS required classes and many schools have a one
or two complete courses devoted to ERP systems. Given the importance of workflow
technology, especially in the Web Services area, more attention to business process definition
and workflow technology is needed in the IS curriculum. More attention to ERP systems and
their relationship to WfMSs is needed in Computer Science.
5 Conclusions
We have conceptualized three different types of business process applications: (1) Workflows
involving humans, (2) Workflows involving systems and applications, and (3) Transactional
workflows, which can be used to illustrate the differences between WfMS and ERP systems.
Most WfMSs address all the three types of workflows outlined above, whereas ERP systems
mainly address the third type, transactional workflows. WfMSs are more suitable to model
workflows involving humans and software systems (Types 1 and 2), especially if the systems are
autonomous and heterogeneous. On the other hand, ERP systems are more appropriate to model
transactional workflows. Nevertheless, when transactional workflows involve heterogeneous
systems a more appropriate solution might be the adoption of a WfMS. This is because ERP
systems generally rely on a common, homogeneous, and interoperable data infrastructure.
Thus, organizations may need ERP or WfMS systems, or both. Workflow management
systems are more directed toward process management, involving application and data
integration of heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed systems. Most of the WfMSs show
domain independence, in the sense they can be implemented in any business sector.
ERP systems are data-centric, and therefore, they are more focused on information
management and data integration. This type of system is also domain-dependent. Business
templates are provided to be used in specific functional and market sectors. ERP systems are
very suitable for a departmental, organizational, and cross-organizational scope operating on a
national or international scale, where there is a good fit between desired organizational processes
and those embedded in ERP applications. The system is built from prefabricated applications.
Both WfMS and ERP systems will play a major role in organizationsâ€™ application integration.
We presented in Section 3 how WfMS and ERP systems can be used independently or together
to address intra- and inter-organizational application integration. The current directions in
application integration point to the architectures shown in Figure 3. In both intra- and inter-
organizational integration, flow logic is being separated out and captured in WfMS with function
logic found in ERP systems, other applications or other WfMS. In intra-organizational area, we
see this represented in the moves by ERP vendors to integrate WfMS into their ERP
architectures and emergence of EAI/BMP workflow based tools.

Figure 3. Intra and inter-enterprise integration using WfMS and ERP systems
As noted in this paper, a solution to enterprise (intra-organization) and e-Commerce (inter-
organization) application integration is the use of workflow technology in conjunction with the
architecture provided by Web Services. The use of workflow technology and Web Services
architecture provides for the orchestration of Web Services and allows any two Web applications
to talk to each other using standard interfaces. ERP customers, in the past, have been locked into
a particular suite of applications based on propriety interfaces. The emerging trend from ERP
vendors of decoupling the flow logic of their applications in order to allow them to be used as a
Web services will continue in the future.
This paper provided a holistic view of ERP and WfMS systems by outlining key differences
and similarities, describing which domains they are most applicable in, and explaining how these
technologies are being combined to address business process improvement and integration. The
view presented was limited by the fact that empirical research data sources were inadequate.
Thus, we had to rely on cases, stories and analyses found in the practitioner literature. To address
this limitation, we did an extensive literature review to provide the most complete and accurate
comparison of these systems.
This paper started with the observation that there were different camps in both business and
academic organizations that deal with ERP and WfMS systems. We hope this paper will
stimulate dialog and integration between these two technology camps.
