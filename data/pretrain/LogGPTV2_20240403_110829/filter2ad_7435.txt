ABSTRACT
(cid:140)e use and prevalence of cloud and large-scale computing infras-
tructures is increasing. (cid:140)ey are projected to be a dominant trend
in computing for the foreseeable future: major cloud operators
are now estimated to house millions of machines each and to host
substantial (and growing) fractions of corporate and government
IT and web infrastructure. CCSW is a forum for bringing together
researchers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and implica-
tions of current and future trends to the security of cloud operators,
tenants, and the larger Internet community. Of special interest are
the security challenges from the integration of cloud infrastructures
with IoT and mobile application deployments. CCSW welcomes
submissions on new threats, countermeasures, and opportunities
brought about by the move to cloud computing, with a preference
for unconventional approaches, as well as measurement studies and
case studies that shed light on the security implications of cloud
infrastructure and use cases.
KEYWORDS
Cloud Computing; Security.
1 MOTIVATION
No ma(cid:138)er what the latest buzzword (grid, cloud, utility computing,
SaaS, etc.), large-scale computing and cloud-like infrastructures
are here to stay. How exactly they will look like tomorrow is still
for the markets to decide, yet one thing is certain: clouds bring
with them new untested deployment and associated adversarial
models and vulnerabilities. (cid:140)us, it is essential that our community
becomes involved. CCS is the ideal target for this workshop due
to its o(cid:137)en avant-garde position in the broader security landscape.
According to Google Scholar (as of a year ago): 4 of the top 20 cited
ACM CCS papers of the past (cid:128)ve years come from CCSW.
2 TOPICAL COVERAGE
ACM CCSW is a forum for presenting novel research or empirical
studies from academia, industry, and government on all theoretical
and practical aspects of security, privacy, and data protection in
cloud scenarios. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
including:
• Secure cloud resource virtualization
• Secure data management outsourcing

tection
We would like to especially encourage novel paradigms and
controversial ideas that are not on the above list. (cid:140)e workshop
is to act as a fertile ground for creative debate and interaction in
security-sensitive areas of computing impacted by clouds.

Ghassan Karame. is the Manager and Chief researcher of the
Security Group of NEC Labs in Germany. Ghassan joined NEC Labs
in April 2012. Prior to that, Ghassan was working as a postdoctoral
researcher in the Institute of Information Security of ETH Zurich,
Switzerland. He holds a Master of Science degree in Information
Networking from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and a PhD
degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich.
Ghassan is interested in all aspects of security and privacy with a
focus on cloud security, IoT security, network security, and Blockchain
security.
Angelos Stavrou. is a full professor at George Mason Univer-
sity and the Director of the Center for Assurance Research and
Engineering (CARE) at GMU. Stavrou has served as principal inves-
tigator on research awards from NSF, DARPA, IARPA, DHS, AFOSR,
ARO, ONR, he is an active member of NIST’s Mobile Security team
and has wri(cid:138)en more than 90 peer-reviewed conference and journal
