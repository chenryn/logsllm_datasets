**ATT&CK ID:** T1561  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Disk Wipe

Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or across a network to disrupt the availability of system and network resources. With direct write access to a disk, adversaries can attempt to overwrite portions of the disk data. They may choose to wipe arbitrary segments of the disk or target specific disk structures, such as the master boot record (MBR). In some cases, adversaries may attempt a complete wipe of all disk sectors, rendering the affected systems inoperable.
