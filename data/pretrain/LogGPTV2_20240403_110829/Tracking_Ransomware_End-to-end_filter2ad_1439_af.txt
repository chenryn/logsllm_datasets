**Partner Distribution:**
Based on our execution of Cerber's two binaries in Section VI-A, it appears that the Partner ID is persistent across different binaries. Since Cerber operates under an affiliate model, each partner distributes a specific binary and receives a percentage of the ransom revenue. The Partner ID provides insight into the number of infected IP addresses for each affiliate.

We extracted the Partner ID from Packets A or B for each infected IP address and presented the number of unique IP addresses for each partner in Figure 10a. Specifically, Partner 0 infected 253 distinct IP addresses, while Partner 1 infected 162. We observed a total of 118 partners, with Partners 0 through 7 accounting for 51.5% of all infected IP addresses. Each of these 8 partners is associated with between 13 and 33 infected countries worldwide. Identifying major affiliates could be useful for prioritizing which affiliates to investigate and target for technical and law enforcement interventions.

**Encryption Duration:**
Recall from Section VI-A that the Cerber binary sends Packet A before encrypting user files and Packet C after encryption is complete. The duration between Packets A and C allows us to measure the time it takes for file encryption to complete. The shorter this duration, the smaller the window for detecting and mitigating the malware before all files are encrypted.

To compute this duration, we first identified IP addresses associated with exactly one Machine ID. If an IP address is associated with multiple Machine IDs, it could have multiple Packets A and C, making it difficult to determine which pair belongs to the same infection. Using IP addresses with a single Machine ID reduces this error, although packet losses could still cause inaccuracies. Absent ground truth, we assume that Packets A and C likely mark the beginning and end of encryption for a single infection.

In total, 412 IP addresses are associated with a single Machine ID, but we received both Packets A and C from only 182 of these IP addresses. For these 182 IP addresses, we plotted the distribution of the encryption duration in Figure 10b. The median duration is 7.8 minutes. This means that if a victim notices one file is encrypted, they have less than 7.8 minutes to back up other documents before they are all encrypted. Alternatively, if the victim uses software that automatically detects ransomware encryption (e.g., using techniques proposed by Kharaz et al. [36]), the detection algorithm has less than 7.8 minutes to react.

### Discussion

Ransomware is known to cause significant harm through monetary losses or destruction of files. Measuring this threat is challenging, but an improved understanding of the ransomware ecosystem is crucial for identifying effective intervention strategies. Based on our measurements, we propose a multi-pronged strategy to improve our ability to measure and reduce the harm caused by ransomware. In this section, we outline our ideas and discuss the challenges, including ethical issues unique to ransomware. A full investigation of our suggestions will require significant future work.

**Estimating Conversion:**
One open question is the conversion rate, i.e., the probability that a victim will pay the ransom given an infection. The telemetry data collected in Section VI could have been used to estimate Cerber's conversion rate, but ethical considerations led us to decide against performing this analysis.

Cerber's telemetry gives indirect access to individual victims' payment records. After encryption, the ransom note appears on the victim's desktop, directing them to visit specific ransom payment websites. These URLs follow the format `http://id1.hostname/id2`, where `id1` is a hidden service ID shared across multiple infections, and `id2` concatenates the Partner ID and Machine ID with an MD5-based checksum. To pay, the victim visits one of the URLs, sees a customized webpage with their Bitcoin ransom address and amount, and starts a five-day countdown. Our telemetry data's Packets B contain both the Partner IDs and Machine IDs, enabling us to compute `id2` and, theoretically, visit the victim's payment URL to check if and when the victim paid.

However, we did not conduct this analysis because visiting the URL might start the countdown prematurely, potentially doubling the ransom amount. Waiting several months after data collection in February 2017 before visiting the URLs would still not guarantee that all victims had either visited the payment URLs or decided to re-install their systems. Thus, the risks of the analysis outweigh the benefits of estimating the conversion rate.

**Coverage Limitations:**
Our measurement techniques provided better coverage than prior methods but were not comprehensive. One limitation is that our transaction filtering methods were not effective for some ransomware families, such as those with dynamic pricing structures or unknown ransom amounts (e.g., Spora). Another limitation was the inability to generate synthetic victims and make micropayments for ransomware campaigns without binaries or that were no longer operating. We plan to explore improved filtering techniques and use OCR and NLP methods to find more reported payments from victims to enhance coverage.

**Intervention:**
Our study identified potential intervention points beyond improved ransomware detection and file backups, such as increasing the difficulty and risk for ransomware operators cashing out their bitcoins. Our methods of tracing ransomware payments assist in this objective; for example, BTC-e's operator was arrested, and the exchange was closed [37].

Another potential intervention is disrupting the victim's ability to pay the ransom. During our analysis of Cerber, we found that the hostname part of the payment URL is generated using a domain-generation algorithm (DGA). Based on our analysis, the hostname is the prefix of the most recent wallet address that receives and sends bitcoins to another wallet address likely controlled by Cerber. This DGA creates an opportunity to disrupt the payment infrastructure. However, we chose not to conduct this intervention, as it would prevent victims from recovering their files, introducing a unique ethical issue.

### Related Work

The initial Bitcoin tracing method linking flows with multiple input transactions was proposed in prior studies [38], [39], [5] and in the original Bitcoin paper [24]. However, this method is now prone to incorrectly linking flows that use anonymization techniques like CoinJoin [23] and CoinSwap [41]. Moser and Bohme [42] developed methods to detect likely anonymized transactions. We use Chainalysis's platform, which employs these methods and additional proprietary techniques to trace bitcoin flows.

BitIodine is a Bitcoin forensic analysis tool that used reported victim ransom payments to perform a payment analysis for CryptoLocker [7]. A follow-up study by Liao et al. [6] expanded this analysis by discovering additional reported victim ransom payments and further analyzing whether an inflow is a likely victim payment (similar to our Filter 1). Researchers from FireEye analyzed the actual conversion rate of infections to paying victims for TeslaCrypt [43].

Intervention strategies include technical solutions like detecting changes on the file system due to ransomware infection [36] and analyzing network traffic [44], or economic solutions like disrupting payment processors [45]. We use BinDiff [31] to identify similar malware binaries, and other related methods include SigMal [46].

### Conclusion

Our study of the ransomware ecosystem highlights the opportunity to gain key insights into the financial operations of cybercriminals using Bitcoin. We created a set of measurement methodologies and conducted a detailed two-year end-to-end examination of the ransomware ecosystem. Our methods allowed us to track ransom payments from the acquisition of bitcoins by victims to the cash-out of bitcoins by ransomware operators. We conservatively estimated that the overall ecosystem revenue for the past two years was over $16 million, extorted from approximately 20,000 victims. Our analysis of ransomware operators' cash-out strategies indicated that BTC-e was a key piece of support infrastructure used to exchange millions of USD worth of ill-gotten bitcoins into fiat currency. Our study also illuminates many open technical and ethical issues in measuring and intervening in the ransomware ecosystem.
