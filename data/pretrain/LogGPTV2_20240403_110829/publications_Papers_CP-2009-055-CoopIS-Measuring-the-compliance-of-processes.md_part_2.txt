either via e-mail, letter or phone. If the airline accepts complaints via the first
two mentioned communication channels only a part of the recommendations is
implemented. We say that the airline is partially mature with respect to com-
pliance maturity. But the ones currently being implemented (e-mail and letter)
correspondto whatthe referencemodel M recommends.In sucha case,we say
1
that the airline is fully compliant with respect to compliance degree.
Granularity of Models. Having two models M and M it may happen
1 2
that the granularity characterizing the level of detail of activities varies. For
example, in Fig. 2, activity Prioritize incident exists in model M , but no such
1
activity exists in model M . Furthermore, it is possible that compliance applies
2
to a set of activities, rather than individual activities. For example, activity
Categorize incident of model M corresponds to a set of activities in model M
1 2
highlightedin Fig.2. In order to accountfor the granularitywe have to identify
thecorrespondenceofactivities.Correspondenceisamappingbetweenactivities
of model M to activities of model M where the functionality of the activities
2 1
is the same. Existing approaches, for example schema or semantic matching
[26,9], assume that the correspondence can be established automatically based

on the labels. The examples of our use case show that it is not realistic to only
assume that equivalent activities may be identified by considering similarities
of labels. For example, the activities Create incident in model M and Create
1
customer’s complaint in model M have the same functionality, but they have
2
different labels. Since the automatic mapping is not applicable, we favor the
manual mapping.
Customizationofthe ReferenceModel. Itisoftenimportanttotreatparts
of model M in a special way when measuring compliance. For example, since
1
reference models do not typically state if the activities have to be executed
exactlyin aspecified order,the ordermay notalwaysbe important.We referto
these special parts as partitions. A partition is a user-selected set of activities
withatype,whichcanbe“Order”or“Exclusion”.Figure3showsthatactivities

which need to be excluded from the compliance analysis.Consider partitionP .
2
Inourusecase,thepreprocessingofanincidentisnotsupportedbytheISright
now. However, a manual activity corresponding to the functionality expressed
by activity Preprocess incident is executed. To prevent the missing activity to
erroneously affect the compliance, the activity is excluded.
Iteration. A special circumstance is the case in which an activity is part
of an arbitrary cycle in process M while it is not in model M . This means
2 1
that this activity can be executed repetitively, while in model M it must be
1
performed correctly in only one iteration. For example, in our use case, the
activities Search for a solution and Inform Customer are performed repeatedly
until the customer accepts the processing of the claim. The existence of the
cycle increases the quality of the process and contributes to a higher degree of
the customer satisfaction. Thus, even if ITIL does not explicitly recommend a
cycle,theairlinefeelsthatthiscycleinmodelM doesnotaffectthecompliance
2
with model M - a contrast with a cycle, which purely means to redo work.

5.1 Theoretical Foundations
PrevioussectionshaveusedtheEPClanguagetomodelprocessessinceitiseasy
to understand and it is widely used in the industry (e.g. the common language
of our use case). We use a more formal approach based on WF-nets [22] for
the design of the compliance algorithm. It is a formalism well suited to analyze
processes since there is a vast amount of research done in this area. We define
the degree of compliance based on the firing sequences of WF-nets.
Definition 1 (WorkFlow net)
A WorkFlow net (WF-net) is a tuple M =(P,T,F,i,o) such that:
– P is a finite set of places,
– T is a finite set of transitions,
– P ∩T =∅,
– F ⊆(P ×T)∪(T ×P) is a set of arcs,
– i∈P is the unique source place such that •i=∅,
– o∈P is the unique sink place such that o•=∅,
– Every node x∈P ∪T is on a path from i to o,
where for each node x∈P∪T the set •x={y|(y,x)∈F} is the preset of x and
x•={y|(x,y)∈F} is the postset of x.
Transitions represent the activities of an instance. The input place (i) and the
output place (o) of the WF-net express the entry point when instances are cre-
atedandtheexitpointwheninstancesaredeleted.Thelastrequirementensures
thatthere areno transitionsandplaces whichdo notcontribute to processing.
Definition 2 (Firing sequence)
Let M =(P,T,F,i,o) be a WF-net and let t∈T be a transition of M.
– A markingK :P →N is a mapping defining the numberof tokens per place.
– t is enabled in a marking K if (∀p∈•t)K(p)≥1.
– t fires from marking K to marking K, denoted by K[tK, if t is enabled in
K and (∀p∈•t)K(p)=K(p)−1 and (∀p∈t•)K(p)=K(p)+1.
– σ = t 1,t 2,...,t n ∈ T∗ is a firing sequence leading from a marking K to
1
a marking K n+1, denoted by K 1[σK n+1, if there are markings K 2,...,K n,
such that K 1[t 1K 2[t 2...K n[t nK n+1.

process instances, which are terminated properly.
Definition 3 (Complete sound firing sequences). Let M = (P,T,F,i,o)
be a WF-net and σ ∈T∗.
– K i is the initial marking with K i(i)=1 and (∀p=i)K i(p)=0.
– K o is the final marking with K o(o)=1 and (∀p=o)K o(p)=0.
Measuring the Compliance of Processes with Reference Models 83
– σ is a complete sound firing sequence, if K i[σK o.
– Let us use S(M) to denote the set of all complete sound firing sequences.
Thisdefinitionignoresunsoundbehavior,forinstanceprocessinstancesrunning
into a deadlock or a livelock. When no ambiguity occurs, we simply refer to σ
as a firing sequence.
Since WF-nets can be considered as directed graphs, where P ∪T is the set
of nodes and F is the set of arcs, we use the standard graph-theoretical notion
of a cycle.
Definition 4 (Cycle). A cycle in a WF-net M = (P,T,F,i,o) is a sequence
of nodes (x 1,...,x n) ∈ (P ∪T)∗, such that (∀1 ≤ i < n)(x i,x i+1) ∈ F and
x =x n.

The existence of cycles causes the set S(M) to be in general infinite. Therefore,
we restrict the number of unroll factors for cycles by a variable parameter1. We
end up with a finite subset of S(M) denoted by S(M). The set S(M) grows
exponentiallyinthe numberoftransitions|T|.However,Sect.5.5willshowthat
ourapproachcanbe usedinpractice.Ourstrategyto dealwithcyclesandtheir
contribution to compliance among competing requirements (see Sect. 4) is to
equate cycles having no correspondence in model M with the action of redoing

work.Thesuperfluousworkmayhaveanegativeeffectonthecompliancevalues.
5.2 Measuring Compliance
To account for the special characteristics of compliance with reference models,
whichwe haveidentifiedinSect.4,weuseseveralparametersto ouralgorithm.
Definition 5 (Granularity mapping). Let be M = (P ,T ,F ,i ,o ) and
1 1 1 1 1 1
M = (P ,T ,F ,i ,o ) two WF-nets where we refer to M as the reference
2 2 2 2 2 2 1
model and to M as the process model. We use a mapping G :T →T to map
2 2 1
activity labels in the process model to activity labels in the reference model. Since
G can be non-injective, this mapping can handle granularity differences between
the two models. Let us use the term granularity mapping for G.
Definition 6 (User-selected partition). Let M be a reference model as
1
stated in Def. 5. A user-selected partition of M is a set of transitions p ⊆ T
1 1
whichcanbeoftype exclusionor order.User-selectedpartitionsoftypeexclusion
are represented with p¯ and those of type order with pˇ. M can have associated
1
with it at most one user-selected partition of type exclusion and an arbitrary fi-
nite number of user-selected partitions of type order. Let us use P to denote the
set of all user-selected partitions associated with M .

Now that we have defined the parameters we deduce the compliance measures.

Definition 7 (Extended firing sequence set, Mapped firing sequence
set). Let M and M be the reference model and the process model as stated in

Def. 5. Let P be the set of all user-selected partitions related to M and let G be

– σext(P) is the set of extended firing sequences of σ , which is derived from

σ by applying two actions to σ : (1) remove the transitions in p¯ from σ

and (2) generate the permutations of σ \p¯for all user-selected partitions pˇ.

– σmap(G) is the set of mapped firing sequences of σ , which is derived from

σ by applying G to all transitions of σ , whereas for each subsequence of

transitions of σ , which are mapped to the same transition t ∈T only one
2 1 1
occurrence of t is placed in the resulting sequences, but possibly at different
1
positions resulting in several mapped sequences.
