Risk Quantiﬁcation Framework
In this chapter about the risk quantiﬁcation framework1, ﬁrst, the model – includ-
ing its parameters as well as related equations and algorithms – is introduced. The
model supports risk management by efﬁciently aggregating the individual risks for
the decomposed parts of an IT scenario back to an overall risk. The second section
describes simulation results regarding sensitivity analysis, identiﬁcation of cost
drivers, and the introduction of inaccuracy. Third, the application of the proposed
risk quantiﬁcation framework using a real-life business process and a prototype of
a SaaS-based implementation are presented.
4.1 Model Description
The framework is build around the thought that – especially for larger IT architec-
tures – it is hard to manage all involved risks using only a high level perspective.
As the complexity of large-scale systems is too high, the model facilitates decom-
position of scenarios into smaller parts, i. e., smaller scenarios for which the IT risk
management process can be carried out more easily. Especially during the phases
of risk identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation, decision makers can, thus, better analyze
and estimate potential risks. The risk quantiﬁcation framework supports risk quan-
tiﬁcation by efﬁciently aggregating the individual risks for the decomposed parts
back to an overall risk distribution.
Each scenario is assumed to consist of various components of different types.
Expert interviews with IT risk management consultants showed that scenarios in-
volving IT outsourcing are usually composed of services and data transfers. Using

visualizations such as the one shown in ﬁgure 4.1 help to better identify and quan-
tify the most critical data transfer-related risks, when data are transferred from one
service of “security zone” (e. g., an in-house service) to another “security zone”
(e. g., a service hosted by an external provider).
All of the risks, found in the conducted literature review (see section 3.1 as well
as tables A.1 and A.2) could be assigned to either services or data transfers. There
were no risks that are neither related to services nor to data transfers. Therefore,
in the following, we speak of scenarios consisting of services and data transfers.
Nonetheless, the proposed model allows incorporation of other types of scenario
components, such as people or devices.
In order to quantify risks of a given scenario and in order to calculate the risk
measure characteristics with which the scenario’s cost drivers can be analyzed, the
distribution of potential losses has to be calculated.
Our approach uses the business process with its risk parameter tables as an in-
put for the calculation. The model parameters, i. e., the variables used to describe a
scenario (e. g., a distributed business process) are described in section 4.1.1, while
two different approaches for calculating the distribution of potential losses is de-
scribed in section 4.1.2. In section 4.1.3, algorithms for deriving risk measures are
presented.
The result is presented in the form of a discrete Probability Density Function
of the Potential Losses (PDFL). See ﬁgures 4.2 and 4.15 for examples of such
functions. Based on this distribution, risk measure characteristics can be derived
using calculations provided in section 4.1.3.
4.1.1 Parameter Descriptions
In this section, all input variables of the model are successively introduced and
described. Sections 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2 present the basic parameters, needed for
every scenario, while sections 4.1.1.3 to 4.1.1.5 present various possible extensions
to the base model.
4.1.1.1 Basic Scenario Parameters
In the previous section, a scenario was described to be composed of services and
data transfers. More generally, we say that a scenario consists of component types,
such as services and data transfers. The set X contains all valid scenario component
types, e. g., X = {S;T}. This states that a scenario consists of two different type:
services (S) and data transfers (T ). Figure 4.1 visualizes an exemplary scenario

of a business process consisting of two different scenario component types, i. e.,
services and data transfers. The nodes of the graph represent the eight services,
while ten data transfers between the services are indicated by the graph’s edges.
The set of all scenario component types X has been introduced in order to be
able to incorporate other abstract types of components that could be important to
risk quantiﬁcation of IT-related scenarios, such as companies, devices, or people.
Additionally, this form allows shorter equations and algorithms because it is no
longer necessary to explicitly incorporate separate service and data transfer related
calculations.
The individual scenario components are stored in sets called Kx, where x indi-
cates the service component type. E. g., if X was deﬁned as above, all of the sce-
nario’s services are contained in the set KS while all data transfers are contained
in KT . For the business process shown in ﬁgure 4.1, the sets could be deﬁned
as KS = {S1; . . .;S8} and KT = {T 1; . . .;T 10}.
4.1.1.2 Basic Risk Parameters
The invocation of services is associated with service-related risks. pS
rk denotes the
occurrence probability of service-related risk r in service k. An incident of service-
related risk r (occurring in one or more of the service calls) causes costs of cS
r .
Additionally, every data transfer k between two services is associated with data
transfer-related risks r with an occurrence probability pT
rk and caused costs of cT
r .
The model is based on the assumption that all risks are uncorrelated. This implies
that all analyzed risks should be mutually exclusive (see, e. g., Wang et al. (2008,
pp. 108f.) for a similar assumption).
If only these basic risk parameters are used to model a scenario, it is possible to
r for each risk r like shown
calculate the aggregated risk occurrence probabilities ¯px
in equation (4.1).

This probability determines the chance that risk r will occur at least once in the
whole scenario. It is derived by calculating the probability for the event that the risk
does not arise in any service or data transfer k and then using the complementary
probability.
4.1.1.3 Extension 1: Advanced Workﬂow Patterns
In order to map business processes using advanced workﬂow patterns, such as
loops and branches, for each risk, we introduce a ﬂag f and a parameter d, for each
service or data transfer. If f is true, the number of invocations dx
k of component k

is taken into account when the overall risk occurrence probability is calculated.
This means that a service which is called twice leads to a higher chance of risk
occurrence while a service which is only called one out of ten times, leads to a
lower probability compared to exactly one invocation. Per default, all dx
k are 1.0
and all ﬂags f x
r are set to false. If the transition probabilities for all conditional
branches of a workﬂow are given, the d parameter values can easily be calculated
by solving a system of linear equations (Ross, 1996).
While some risks, such as inﬂexible contracting, are related to the provider,
other risks, such as eavesdropping using Man-in-the-Middle attacks, could occur
in every single data transfer (Schneier, 2004). Therefore, it is important to be able
to model loops and branches. This allows modeling business processes that iterate
over a set of customers or products, where a subset of the services is called multiple
times. Additionally, branches are necessary in order to model optional services
which are not invoked every time the workﬂow runs, for example, because they
are charged on a pay-per-use basis.
If ﬂag f for a service- or data transfer-related risk is set, the number of invoca-
k, is incorporated into the calculation of the combined
r of risk r for scenario component type x

and aggregated occurrence probability ¯px

fected services or data transfers and allow modeling scenarios where the potential

Dependent losses occur, for example, if downtime of one service is more critical
than non-availability of others, e. g., because there might be no fallback-services
or because it might take longer to recover in certain cases. Another example are
replay attacks (Biskup, 2009): It might be harmless if a valid data transmission
is fraudulently repeated to a service that just performs the task of validating data.

4 Risk Quantiﬁcation Framework
Conversely, an order service accepting maliciously repeated order messages could
lead to complete disorder of a supply chain.
The calculation can be modeled to be a new instance of the base problem: Each
service or data transfer is modeled to be a new risk with its speciﬁc costs cx
rk and
overall occurrence probability px
rk. After calculating the joint probability density
function (see section 4.1.2.2), all cost values of this distribution except the costs
equal to zero are increased by the global costs cx
r.
Please note that, if there is a service or data transfer with individual costs of zero
and an occurrence probability greater zero, it is necessary to keep track of when
the risk did and did not occur, because later the global costs need to be added to
only the cases where it occurred.
4.1.1.5 Extension 3: Conditional Probabilities
For some risks, it may be necessary to deﬁne a global event whose occurrence
inﬂuences the probabilities that the risk occurs in the individual services or data
transfers. Examples for these events can be that a used security mechanism (e. g.,
an encryption algorithm) suddenly becomes insecure or a ﬁre in the local data
center which affects internal services. Therefore, for each risk r, we introduce a
parameter px
r which deﬁnes the occurrence probability of the global event. If the
event does not occur, all px
rk deﬁne
the chance of risk occurrence. This property is connected to conditional indepen-
dence and closely related to the concept of divergent Bayes nets. The default value
for the event-related global probabilities px
rk are treated to be 0.0. If the event occurs, the px
An example of such a global event may be that insufﬁcient separation of co-
existing Virtual Machines (VMs) in a Cloud Computing infrastructure can be ex-
ploited. This would increase the chances that attackers on the same system can
access other VMs’ virtual disks or memory without authentication. Furthermore,
it could lead to conﬁdentiality risks, such as data leakage, but could also be a threat
to integrity in case of unauthorized data modiﬁcations (Dawoud et al., 2010).
r is 1.0.
The conditional probabilities can be incorporated before the calculation of the
overall risk occurrence probabilities, by multiplying the individual service- or data

4.1.2 Calculations of the Overall Risk Distribution
91
The following two sections describe two different approaches for calculating the
overall probability density function of the potential losses. Both approaches will
be compared in section 4.2.3.
4.1.2.1 Power Set-Based Approach
A ﬁrst approach to calculate the costs’ probability density function is based on the
power set P of all risks. This approach relies on the aggregated risk occurrence
probabilities ¯px
r which means that it is not possible to use individual losses per
scenario component (see section 4.1.1.4). The process of calculation the overall
probability density function PDFL consists of the following steps:
1. Aggregate the individual occurrence probabilities px
rk to the aggregated risk
occurrence probabilities ¯px
r for each risk r using equation (4.1)
2. Calculate the overall PDFL using the power set-based approach using listing 4.1
Listing 4.1 represents the most basic form of the algorithm, as it only allows ba-
sic risk parameters deﬁned in section 4.1.1.2. The algorithm does not yet incorpo-
rate advanced workﬂow patterns (see section 4.1.1.3) and conditional probabilities
(see section 4.1.1.5).
The algorithm iterates over all possible combinations of risks that could oc-
cur simultaneously (line 3). For each combination the probability and the arising
costs are calculated (lines 6 to 13) and added to the probability density function
of the potential losses PDFL (lines 14 to 18) which maps costs to their occurrence
probability (Ackermann and Buxmann, 2010, p. 5).
Each subset in the power set P represents one possible combination of risks ∈
{(X;Rx) | x ∈ X} that can occur together. The computation can, e. g., be imple-
mented using a bit representation for iterating over all items in the power set. If a
bit is one, the associated risk occurs, if it is zero, the risk does not occur. In total,
there is one bit for each of the R risks. As the algorithm iterates over all integers
from zero to 2R − 1, all 2R possible combinations of risks that can occur together
can be analyzed.
For each bit conﬁguration, the algorithm performs R−1 multiplications in order
to calculate the aggregated risk occurrence probability ¯px
r using equation (4.1). In
summary, this leads to 2R · (R− 1) multiplications. Regardless of the probability
and cost values, the number of multiplications remains the same.
This approach, however, has some disadvantages. For every added risk, more
than twice as many multiplications have to be calculated. Additionally, because of

the used bit representation, the algorithm scales only to the number of bits available
per integer or long, which means that, in most cases, more than 64 risks cannot be
handled.
Furthermore, it can be shown that 2R−1 · (R− 2) multiplications are unneces-
sarily repeated. For a large number of risks, the ratio of unnecessarily repeated
multiplications to the total number of multiplications approaches 50%, which is
shown in equation (4.3).

This means that using the power set-based approach, a sufﬁciently large num-
ber of risks cannot – or only with great difﬁculty – be taken into account. More-
over, research on IT outsourcing increasingly identiﬁed more and more risks over
the last couple of years. For example, Earl (1996) lists eleven risks, Lacity et al.
(2009) presents a collection of 28 risks, and Ackermann et al. (2011) identiﬁed 70
technological risks of IT outsourcing.
