Hello,

As discussed in the forum post, there is a documentation error in the SpEL (Spring Expression Language) section. Specifically, the documentation references a method that is defined on a concrete class, but it is incorrectly shown as being called on an interface.

For more detailed information, please refer to the forum post.

Thank you.
