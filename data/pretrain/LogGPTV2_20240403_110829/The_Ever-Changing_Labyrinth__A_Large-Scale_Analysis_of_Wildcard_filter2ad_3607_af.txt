Appendix
A Seed Expansion through Google Search
We can start from our testing site, identify the ﬁrst layer
of parent sites S1 leading to it, and recursively identify
sites at upper layers Sn(n > 1), till there are no more new
sites discovered. We seek the help from Google Search
for this task and develop a C++ program which directs
Firefox to automatically search on Google. In essence,
it keeps a queue of domains to be searched, pops out
the ﬁrst URL and queries Google, extracts all search re-
sult URLs in top 10 pages, and saves the domains unvis-
ited into the queue. The process ends when the queue is
empty.
Though the spider pool sites could be detected, the
performance is poor and the process is hard to converge.
We ﬁnd there are two main reasons. First of all, it takes
quite some time for Google to respond to our web re-
quest, and CAPTCHA has to be solved occasionally.
Second, the returned search results usually include sites
not in spider pool, e.g., sites providing domain regis-
tration information and fake search engines which copy
search results from other search engines 13. Such irrel-
evant sites have to be excluded, otherwise the iterations
will be inaccurate and may not even converge, but using
straightforward ﬁltering metrics like domain ranking and
URL patterns are not effective through our testing.
B Classiﬁcations of SEO domains
We identiﬁed three types of methods of linking cus-
tomer’s content to SEO pages. They are listed below:
1. Through iframe. Instead of pointing to customer’s
site, the SEO page directly encloses the customer’s
page in an HTML iframe. It leverages JavaScript
API document.write to inject the iframe, which
occupies the whole screen when the user lands on
the site. It could accumulate more trafﬁc towards
customer’s site when visitors happen to land on
SEO page.
2. Through hyperlink. The hyperlink pointing to cus-
tomer’s site or containing customer’s message is
displayed in the SEO page. This type is also used in
SSP we inﬁltrated.
3. Through redirection. For this type, a visit to
SEO page using certain user-agent string (e.g.,
Opera browser) is immediately redirected to cus-
tomer’s site through HTTP 302 redirect.
In fact,
it uses JavaScript code to assign customer’s URL
to window.top.location.href and HTML meta
refresh tag to redirect visitor’s browser. Likewise,
13The purpose of setting up such fake search engines is not yet clear.
We suspect they are used for click fraud [29].
customer’s content can be directly pushed to visi-
tor’s browser.

C Topics of Customer Sites
The 930 customer sites are classiﬁed under 7 categories
below:
1. Sales and Services. We ﬁnd industrial equipments
and products, like elevator and seamless pipe, are
sold on the customers’ sites. Services of gray areas
are also provided, like private detective and empty
invoices.
2. Gambling. It includes sites for online casino and
sports betting.
5. Sex. Some of the sites host adult content like porn
video and photos, while others list contacts of afﬁl-
iated prostitutes or their agents.
6. Games. Online games developed by less known
companies are provided.
In addition, some sites
provide information about the unauthorized servers
for big-brand games, like The Legend of Mir [1],
which can be connected to play the same game for
free or less fees.
7. Hospitals and Drugs. We ﬁnd the sites in this cat-
egory introduce hospitals which do not have valid
licenses. Besides, illegal drugs, like hallucinogen,
are sold in some sites.
3. Surrogacy. The sites provide channels for infertile
parents to ﬁnd women willing to carry pregnancy.
4. News. The sites serve as news portals about local
events.

D Classiﬁcations on Customer Messages
We analyze customer messages, extract QQ numbers
from customer messages, and sort them by the number
of associated URLs. The result is shown in Table 9.
E Impact on Search Engines
We sampled 43 long-tail keywords extracted from the
SEO pages crawled from the 21 spider pools and search
them in Google and Baidu. The result is shown in Ta-
ble10. We count the percentage of search results showing
spider pool domains. If no search results are returned,
we write “no search result”.
If no spider domains are
presented in search results, we write “no keyword”.
