 MOST POPULAR UNTIL 2008
– Smartkey introduced to Canada and U.S.
PIN TUMBLER v. SMARTKEY
PIN TUMBLER DESIGN
 NOT SECURE
 Easy to pick
 Easy to bump
 Easy to impression
 Easy to mechanically bypass
 Can be master keyed
 Easy to determine the Top Level MK
 Limited number of combinations
PIN TUMBLER DESIGN:
How it works
PIN STACKS = SECURITY:
Plug can turn: pins at shearline
LOCKED: 
PINS NOT AT SHEARLINE
KWIKSET SMARTKEY:
Not a pin tumbler lock
SMARTKEY ATTRIBUTES
 5 PIN ONLY 6 DEPTH INCREMENTS 
 SINGLE SIDEBAR SECURITY
 EXTREMELY PICK RESISTANT UL437
 CANNOT BE BUMPED
 CANNOT BE IMPRESSIONED
 INSTANT PROGRAMMABILITY TO 
ANY KEY
 CANNOT BE MASTER KEYED
MORE ATTRIBUTES
 ONE PRIMARY KEYWAY
 BHMA 156.5 GRADE 1 RATING
 UL 437 RATING
 SPECIAL “KEY CONTROL DEADBOLT’ 
AS ALTERNATIVE TO MK SYSTEM
SMARTKEY DESIGN
PROGRAMMABLE SLIDERS
SIDEBAR =SMARTKEY SECURITY
MASTER KEY SYSTEMS:
Pin Tumbler v. Smartkey
 CONVENTIONAL MK SYSTEMS
CONVENTIONAL MK 
SYSTEM ATTRIBUTES
 ONE KEY OPENS MANY LOCKS
– Only bottom pin and master pin per chamber
 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF KEYING
– Can reduce number of change keys
 EXPENSIVE TO REKEY OR ADD KEYS
– Must disassemble cylinder to rekey
 CROSS KEYING BETWEEN LOCKS 
AND SYSTEMS
MK SYSTEM SECURITY
 INHERENT INSECURITY
 MUST HAVE AT LEAST TWO 
SECURITY LAYERS
 EASIER TO COMPROMISE ENTIRE 
SYSTEM
– Multiple shear lines
– Unintended key combinations will open lock
– Easier to pick, bump, impression, decode
– Extrapolation of TMK
KWIKSET KEY CONTROL:
The Alternative to Master Keying
 TWO INDEPENDENT CORES
 TWO SEPARATE AND DISTINCT KEYS
– Supposed to maintain security of key blanks
– Control key only from factory
 INSTANTLY REPROGRAMMABLE
 NO CROSS KEYING OR INCIDENTAL 
MASTER KEYS
 NOT A REAL MK SYSTEM
 ONLY ONE LEVEL OF KEYING
KWIKSET “KEY CONTROL”
Positive Attributes
 NO LOCKSMITH REQUIRED
 46,656 THEORETICAL COMBINATIONS
 GOOD FOR FACILITIES THAT NEED 
ONE MK LEVEL ONLY
 GREAT FOR CONSTRUCTION MK
 NO DISASSEMBLY OF CYLINDERS
 TWO INDEPENDENT SHEAR LINES 
WITH NO INTERACTION LIKE 
CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS
KWIKSET “KEY CONTROL”
More positive attributes
 INSTANT ABILITY TO REPROGRAM
 TWO SEPARATE KEYWAYS
 CANNOT DERIVE CONTROL KEY 
FROM CHANGE KEY
 LIKE CORBIN “MASTER SLEEVE” 
SYSTEM 75 YEARS AGO, 
INHERENTLY MORE SECURE
 LITTLE CHANCE OF ONE SYSTEM 
OPENING ANOTHER
KWIKSET “CONTROL KEY”
The Bad
 NO WARRANTY FOR COMMERCIAL
 NOT FOR COMPLEX OR 
COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS
 CAN BE COMPROMISED IN 15 
SECONDS
 EASY TO DECODE CONTROL KEY
 EASY TO REPLICATE CONTROL KEY
 NO PATENT PROTECTION ON KEYS
SECURITY: 
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
 DO YOU EXPECT A $20-$30 LOCK TO 
PROVIDE ANY SECURITY?
– Some buyers cannot afford higher security
– What is the minimum they are entitled to?
 KWIKSET KNOWS THESE LOCKS 
HAVE SERIOUS VULNERABILITIES
 DOES THE PUBLIC HAVE A RIGHT TO 
KNOW HOW EASY TO OPEN?
– Should there be warnings on packaging?
KWIKSET SMARTKEY:
INSECURITY ENGINEERING
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND 
FACILITIES AT POTENTIAL RISK
– COVERT ENTRY
– FORCED ENTRY
 KWIKSET “Highest grade of residential 
security available.”
– True but misleading
– Open in less than thirty seconds
FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY
 BHMA GRADE 1 RATING
 “Highest grade of residential security”
 UL 437 PICKING RATING
 VIRTUALLY BUMP PROOF
 USERS ARE NOT AWARE OF RISKS
 LOCKS CAN BE OPENED IN SECONDS
 FAILURE TO DISCLOSE 
VULNERABILITIES
KWIKSET ADVERTISING and
MISREPRESENTAIONS
 FALSE OR MISLEADING 
STATEMENTS BY TECH SUPPORT 
AND SALES
 8 SEPARATE INTERVIEWS:
– “Cannot be opened except by drilling”
– “No maintenance problems”
– “Video on YouTube not true: lock was 
tampered with”
– “No way can be opened with a screwdriver”
– “The problem has been dealt with”
SMARTKEY DESIGN ISSUES
 SIDEBAR SHOULD PROVIDE MORE 
SECURITY THAN PIN TUMBLER LOCK
 ONLY ONE LAYER OF SECURITY
 SMALL FRAGILE SLIDERS
 PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS
 LOW TOLERANCE, LIMITED DIFFERS
– 243 Key combinations
– All the same blank
 CAST METAL EASILY COMPROMISED
MORE DESIGN ISSUES
 PLUG DESIGN CAN BE WARPED
 SLIDER DESIGN
 ABLE TO DECODE THE SLIDERS
 SLIDERS EASILY JAMMED
 TAILPIECE DESIGN AND ACCESS
 NO KEY DETENT FOR 
PROGRAMMING
SMARTKEY: 
METHODS OF DEFEAT
 TRYOUT  KEYS
 TAILPIECE, WIRE THROUGH 
KEYWAY
 VISUALLY READ SLIDER POSITION
 TORQUE THE PLUG AND OPEN

SLIDER AND KEY CODE
 INSERT BORESCOPE OR MIRROR TO 
VIEW POSITION
TORQUE THE PLUG
 BELIEVE VIOLATES THE BHMA 156.5
 Formal complaint filed
 HOW THE LOCK CAN BE 
COMPROMISED: DESIGN ISSUES
– Warp sliders or keyway
– Application of 110 pound force inches
– Set sliders to specific position
– Apply torque with 4” screwdriver and wrench
– OPEN IN ABOUT FIFTEEN SECONDS
SLIDER DESIGN AND 
TORQUE ATTACK
TORQUE AND BHMA 156.5
REQUIREMENT = 300 lbf-in
OPEN in 112 lbf-in
112 Pounds Force Inches = OPEN
KEY CONTROL: NONE
SMART KEY LOCKS 
AND KEY CONTROL
DECODING THE LOCK OR 
CONTROL KEY
 KEY CONTROL BLANK ONLY 
AVAILABLE FROM FACTORY
 NOT THE SAME AS CHANG KEY
 SPECIAL DECODER TO READ THE 
SLIDERS
MAKING THE CONTROL KEY
 SEPARATE KEYWAYS ARE NOT 
SUPPOSED TO BE 
INTERCHANGEABLE
 THE REPRESENTATION: CONTROL 
KEYS ARE SECURE
CHANGE KEYS AND 
CONTROL KEYS
SUMMARY: 
SMARTKEY INSECURITY
 ONE OF MOST POOPULAR AND 
INEXPENSIVE LOCKS IN US. AND 
CANADA
 CONSUMER FRIENDLY
 FILLS CERTAIN NEEDS
 SECURE AGAINST CERTAIN 
ATTACKS
– Picking
– Bumping
BURGLARS: 
THEY DON’T PICK LOCKS
 PICK RESISTANT
 BUMP PROOF
 ALL OF THE SECURITY IS MEANINGLESS 
IF THE LOCK CAN BE OPENED IN 15 
SECONDS
 PATENTS MEAN NOTHING
 BHMA RATINGS MEAN NOTHING
 COULD BE MADE SECURE
 YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
