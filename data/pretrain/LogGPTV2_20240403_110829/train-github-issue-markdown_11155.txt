**Current behavior**  
My application is not always redirecting when I enter the URL into the address
bar of Internet Explorer 11. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. I
do not see this problem with the Chrome browser.
**Expected behavior**  
When an user enters an URL into the address bar, my application should always
redirect to the "page" associated with the URL.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
I cannot provide a _MINIMAL DEMO_ of the problem via plnkr because I need to
enter a value into the address bar for the application and that functionality
is not supported by plnkr.
To reproduce,
  1. First, get and build a starter project like the one from Angular class.  
`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-webpack-
starter.git`  
`cd angular2-webpack-starter `  
`npm install `  
`npm start `
  2. When the application is ready, then open an internet explorer 11 browser, enter the URL "http://localhost:3000" into the address bar, and press enter.
  3. Click on the hyperlink "Detail" in the page. Then select (CTRL-A) and copy (CTRL-C) the URL from the address bar. You should have copied "http://localhost:3000/#/detail".
  4. Click on the hyperlink "Index" in the page to return to the home page.
  5. In the internet explorer address bar, replace the entire URL by pasting (CTRL-V) the URL from step 3, and press enter.
  6. This should redirect internet explorer to the detail page but sometimes it does not. If you do see the detail page, repeat steps 4 and 5 until you see the bug. I usually see the error by the third repetition.
