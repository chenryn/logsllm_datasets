**Current Behavior:**
My application inconsistently redirects when I enter the URL into the address bar of Internet Explorer 11. The redirection sometimes works and sometimes fails. This issue is not observed in the Chrome browser.

**Expected Behavior:**
When a user enters a URL into the address bar, the application should consistently redirect to the corresponding page associated with that URL.

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions:**
I am unable to provide a minimal demo via Plunker because the issue requires entering a value into the address bar, which is not supported by Plunker. To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. Clone and set up a starter project, such as the one from Angular Class:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-webpack-starter.git
   cd angular2-webpack-starter
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. Once the application is running, open Internet Explorer 11 and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Click on the "Detail" hyperlink on the page. Then, select (CTRL-A) and copy (CTRL-C) the URL from the address bar. It should be `http://localhost:3000/#/detail`.

4. Click on the "Index" hyperlink to return to the home page.

5. In the Internet Explorer address bar, replace the current URL by pasting (CTRL-V) the URL copied in step 3, and press Enter.

6. The browser should redirect to the detail page, but it may fail to do so. If the detail page loads, repeat steps 4 and 5 until you encounter the issue. The problem typically manifests by the third repetition.

**Environment Information:**
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0
- **Browser:** Internet Explorer 11
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.0.3
