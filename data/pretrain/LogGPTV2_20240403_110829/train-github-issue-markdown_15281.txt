The first couple of paragraphs say that `y` must be a condensed distance
matrix, but the `Parameters` section says that `y` is optionally a data array.
In practice the function does different things depending on the shape of `y`:
if it appears 1d then it is treated as a condensed distance matrix, otherwise
if it is 2d then it is treated as a data matrix (not as a compressed or
uncompressed distance matrix). If it is not 1d or 2d then it falls off the
if/elif and tries to return something that doesn't exist.
Here's the MATLAB function that `hierarchy.linkage` appears to try to clone:
