In each of the data gathering scenarios, multiple laptops
were used as noted earlier with each laptop possessing multi-
ple external wireless adapters. Individual laptops were con-
ﬁgured to monitor multiple channels both within a band
and between bands, i.e., either monitor multiple 2.4 GHz
channels (Channel 1, Channel 11) or across multiple bands
(2.4 GHz Channel 1, 5 GHz Channel 153). The intuition
behind the setup was to capture both the scan width (how
long does it take for a device to complete a scan across the
2.4 GHz band) as well as dual-band capabilities (2.4 vs. 5
GHz). Notably, 5 GHz adoption rose signiﬁcantly even over
the course of this study making our dataset likely to under-
estimate the net PRs / minute with the most recent slate
of mobile devices. Data was processed through a combina-
tion of tshark and Python with PR information stored in a
MySQL database. Following processing, data ﬁles are dis-
carded and only anonymized header information is preserved
for the purpose of analysis.
Table 1 shows the key characteristics observed across each
of the respective venues. The data is broken for each band
and represents the impact on only one particular channel
(Channel 1 for 2.4 GHz, Channel 153 for 5 GHz). Taking
the Michigan game as an example, for the 2.4 GHz band, the
average density of PRs comes in at 2,778 per minute, just
over 46 PRs per second. The 5 GHz channel sees remarkably
fewer PRs (294 per minute) but it is also notable that many
devices were still not fully 5 GHz capable at the time of
our experiment as noted earlier. While we had expected to
see a bump in 5 GHz PRs at the Stanford game due to the
recent release of iPhone 6, the inclement weather had clear
impacts in terms of attendance for the game (upper 30◦F,
rainy). Even with the reduced fan turnout, the number of
PRs for the Stanford game still averaged 2098 per minute in
Channel 1 (nearly 35 PRs per second).
The introduction of the iPhone 6, iOS 8, and newer ver-
sions of Android also added peculiarities to the experiment
as the source MAC on WiFi scans could no longer safely be
viewed as an indicator of the device density [13]. Android
also introduced similar functionality. Hence, while the num-
ber of PRs is accurate, the number of unique source MACs
from the Stanford game onwards is reasonably suspect.
Regardless of the issues with device counts via unique
source MACs, PRs can serve as an alternative indicator of
device density as PRs are a function of existing WiFi connec-
tivity, device type / conﬁguration (ex. Android, iOS), and
device usage (screen on, WiFi scanning screen). In contrast
to the stadium, each of the class periods exhibits dramati-
cally diﬀerent prevalences with regards to PRs. As would be
expected with an established WiFi infrastructure, most UEs
are likely to have been associated and hence do not nearly as
aggressively probe the WiFi spectrum. Most importantly as
noted earlier in the contributions, the prevalence of PRs in
the reasonably populated large classroom (several hundred
individuals) is dwarfed by nearly an order of magnitude ver-
sus the stadium environment. Critically, while a legitimate
WiFi deployment in the stadium would be likely to reduce
the prevalence of PRs, there still would likely be a non-trivial
number of unaﬃliated UEs who will continue to aggressively
probe in such venues.
Circling back around, from an overhead perspective for
nearly all cases aside from initial entry to the venue, each
Probe Request can be viewed as wasteful as either no pub-
lic WiFi exists (stadium) or the infrastructure is unlikely
to change (classroom). The waste manifests itself from a
foundational perspective by virtue of time consumed on the
primary channel as well as secondary consumption on in-
terfering channels. Hence, a simplistic way to evaluate the
waste of PR is to explore the time consumption for each
request. From a distributional analysis, the most common
rate setting (92%) for PRs in the 2.4 GHz spectrum was 1.0
Mb/s with speeds observed for PRs up to 11.0 Mb/s. PRs in
the 5 GHz spectrum were universally set to 6.0 Mb/s. If we
assume a rough PR size of 100 bytes, a perfect PR (ignoring
CIFS, DIFS, 802.11 headers, DCF eﬀects) would be 800 mi-
croseconds. The reality though is that the PR consumes an
impact of much more than the 800 microseconds of air time
due to, for example, the exponential back-oﬀ introduced by
DCF.
First, frequent PRs are highly likely to impact the DCF of
any mobile nodes aﬃliated with WiFi. While the stadium
does not oﬀer WiFi, we could view the mobile nodes as cap-
tured as being indicative of nodes without ANDSF policies
/ uncooperative mobile nodes, the extent of which would
require careful observation that is beyond the scope of this
paper. Second, for the 2.4 GHz channels, the lack of channel
orthogonality means that as a mobile node iterates through
an active scan, it may cause issues as it traverses nearby
channels (ex. Channel 2, Channel 3, Channel 4, Channel
5 on Channel 1). If we are lucky, the overlapping channels
have a minimal impact. Otherwise, the air time consumed
on the overlapping channels may create signiﬁcant bit errors
for the primary users. Third, while PRs are relatively short,
the low data rates of the PRs means that the actively scan-
ning nodes tend to clutter / slow down the higher speed /
aﬃliated nodes (ex. 1 Mb/s vs. 54 Mb/s). This disparity
of speed is only ampliﬁed in the 5 GHz bands with higher

potential peak speeds aﬀorded by 802.11n (270 Mb/s) and
802.11ac (1.3 Gb/s). Later in this paper, we explore the
impacts on 802.11n via small scale experiments. Fourth,
as indicated by the observations from the classroom, mo-
bile nodes may continue to scan even once aﬃliated with an
AP if AP performance is insuﬃcient or simply if the mobile
nodes hopes for observing ‘better’ WiFi.
3.2 Scanning Behavior Analysis
To explore the data further, we dive into the data as
observed from the games of Northwestern and Michigan.
The reason for exploring the Northwestern game is that ob-
servations from the bowl allowed us to experience a much
more representative sample of the ultra-dense environment
at scale. In contrast to the gate-based observations for the
prior three games with somewhat transient behavior (queu-
ing at the gates), the Northwestern game presented obser-
vations from a ﬁxed vantage point. We also include the
Michigan game (before iOS 8) for the purpose of investigat-
ing how iOS 8 MAC randomization could potentially impact
our measurements on WiFi scanning behaviors, particularly,
the scan interval [13].
Figure 1 plots CDFs of the inter-scan interval that repre-
sents the average wait time between successive scans initi-
ated by mobile nodes across both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.
Each CDF is also broken out by the requests for empty
SSIDs (interval between unknown SSIDs) and known SSIDs
via the PNL. A low-pass ﬁlter is applied with a ﬂoor of three
seconds as observed by the data distributions which means
the interval is only counted if the node has at least three sec-
Figure 3: Number of SSIDs per Active Scan
onds of idle time between requests from the same MAC with
the same SSID. SSIDs from the PNL may only be counted
once for a given MAC (ex. BestBuy matching with Best-
Buy counts and then precludes any subsequent matches in
the same scan for that UE). The interesting result is that at
the 2.4 GHz spectrum many nodes (60% for Michigan and
40% for Northwestern) scanned quite frequently at intervals
around or smaller than 10 seconds. The frequent scan may
in part be driven by the cellular network on campus being
overwhelmed on game day (nearly 150k individuals can be
on campus) as well as individuals turning on their phone
trying to ﬁnd WiFi while waiting in line to enter the sta-
dium.
Next, Figure 2 measures the average time duration for a
particular active scan. The duration is recorded by measur-
ing the occurrence of the ﬁrst PR for a UE in Channel 1
followed by the appearance of the last PR for that same UE
in Channel 11. Time synchronization is provided by running
each of the monitors on the same laptop in monitor mode.
The data for Figure 2 was focused only on the 2.4 GHz band.
Both the CDF and the Frequency (PDF) are plotted in the
ﬁgure. Interestingly, there are two clusters that can largely
be attributed to diﬀerences between the respective mobile
operating systems. On the left side, Android devices tend
to frequently try to cap the maximum scan width ranging
typically less than 800 milliseconds. Alternatively, iOS de-
vices tend to fan out over a wider period of time by scanning
for up to 2 seconds at a time. Critically, Android devices
tend to squeeze as many PRs as possible into a shorter pe-
