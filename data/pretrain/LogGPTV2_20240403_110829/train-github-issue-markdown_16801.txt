The waypoint throws an error asking you to make sure your li element has a
closing tag even though all of them do. The reason for this error is really
the fact that the element has a class assigned to it. I read the waypoint
instructions as saying to replace the
elements with
* elements but keep the class. Maybe consider creating an additional check/error for 
* elements with classes assigned to them.
