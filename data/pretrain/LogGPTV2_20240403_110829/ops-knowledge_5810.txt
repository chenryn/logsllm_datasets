User: I am new to Python (2.7) but I am trying to run a program that requires the "requests" module. I have installed pip using the get-pip.py script and registered the Python27 and Python27/Scripts paths as environment variables.
When I run "python -m pip install -U pip" it says the package is already up-to-date.
Following installation guides, when I run "pip install requests" I get a new command prompt line. I tried "easy_install requests" and get the same thing. I tried "pip install --verbose requests" and have the same behavior (so much for being verbose!).
I am running on Windows Vista Ultimate, using the command prompt as administrator.
Assistant: Since the "python -m pip install -U pip" actually displayed something, on a hunch I tried:
"python -m pip install requests"
This worked! I don't know why any of the installation guides do not say to do this.
