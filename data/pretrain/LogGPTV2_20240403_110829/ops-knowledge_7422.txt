User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Key-Based SSH Permission denied (publickey) Ubuntu 12-04 I have configured sshd to accept key-based ssh logins with LogLevel on DEBUG, and uploaded my public key to ~/.ssh.authorized_keys, where permissions are set as:

700 ~/.ssh
600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

From root, I can su - USERNAME.  From the client I get Permission denied (publicly).  From the server Here's how it is telling me that it "Could not open authorized keys '/home/USERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys': Permission denied".
