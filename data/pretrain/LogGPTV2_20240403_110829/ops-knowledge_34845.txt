I have installed the Designate client on the same server where the Designate service is running, using OpenStack Juno. After setting up the environment with `.venv/bin/activate` and configuring the Keystone variables using the `keystonerc_admin` command, I encountered an error when trying to run the `designate --debug server-list` command. The error message is as follows:

```
EndpointNotFound: public endpoint for hpext:dns service in RegionOne region not found
```

Could you please help me resolve this issue?

**Response:**

The `hpext:dns` service type is from a time when Designate was still an incubated project and was used in HP Cloud. For anyone not using the HP Public Cloud service, the standard `dns` service type should be used instead. This is the default in the `python-designateclient`, so no additional configuration should be necessary.

If you are still encountering issues, please ensure that the Designate service is correctly registered with Keystone and that the appropriate endpoints are set up. You can verify this by listing the services and endpoints in Keystone:

```sh
openstack service list
openstack endpoint list
```

If the `dns` service or its endpoints are missing, you may need to register them manually. Please refer to the OpenStack documentation for detailed instructions on how to do this.
