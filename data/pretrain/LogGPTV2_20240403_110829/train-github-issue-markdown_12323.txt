I may be totally off on this, but I wanted to point it out...
I noticed that on the "Customize" page, you can set the @screen-sm-min,
@screen-md-min, @screen-lg-min variables, as well as the @container-sm,
@container-md and @container-lg variables. But after compiling it, I still
seem to be getting the default break-points on the container width for small
and medium.
So on the customize page, if I enter...  
@screen-sm-min = 992px  
@screen-md-min = 1200px  
@screen-lg-min = 1600px
@container-sm = 970px  
@container-md = 1170px  
@container-lg = 1570px
I end up with...
    @media (min-width: 768px) { /*Should be 992px*/
      .container {
        width: 970px;
      }
    }
    @media (min-width: 992px) { /*Should be 1200px*/
      .container {
        width: 1170px;
      }
    }
    @media (min-width: 1600px) {
      .container {
        width: 1570px;
      }
    }
This will make the container wider than the screen on small and meduim. I
think the issue may be that in the less files, they are referencing @screen-sm
instead of @screen-sm-min (same for md) for the container width.
    // Set the container width, and override it for fixed navbars in media queries
    .container {
      .container-fixed();
      @media (min-width: @screen-sm) { /*Should be @screen-sm-min?*/ 
        width: @container-sm;
      }
      @media (min-width: @screen-md) {/*Should be @screen-md-min?*/ 
        width: @container-md;
      }
     @media (min-width: @screen-lg-min) {
        width: @container-lg;
      }
    }
