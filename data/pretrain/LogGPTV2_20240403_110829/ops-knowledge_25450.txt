User: I think in the past python scripts would run off CGI, which would create a new thread for each process.
I am a newbie so I'm not really sure, what options do we have?
Is the web server pipeline that python works under any more/less effecient than say php?
Assistant: You can still use CGI if you want, but the normal approach these days is using WSGI on the Python side, e.g. through mod_wsgi on Apache or via bridges to FastCGI on other web servers.  At least with mod_wsgi, I know of no inefficiencies with this approach.
BTW, your description of CGI ("create a new thread for each process") is inaccurate: what it does is create a new process for each query's service (and that process typically needs to open a database connection, import all needed modules, etc etc, which is what may make it slow even on platforms where forking a process, per se, is pretty fast, such as all Unix variants).
