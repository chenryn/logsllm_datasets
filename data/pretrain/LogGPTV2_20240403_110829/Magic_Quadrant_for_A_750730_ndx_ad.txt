ChallengersThe APM and Observability Challengers quadrant comprises vendors with broad market reach and large deployments. Vendors in this quadrant typically have strong execution capabilities and a significant sales and brand presence garnered from the company as a whole, if not directly from its APM-related activities. Some vendors previously may have been among the top performers in the market and, thus, offer broad product portfolios. Vendors in this quadrant may be transforming their product offerings and market focus. In some cases, their APM offerings are often positioned as elements of a larger solution that may even extend beyond the boundaries of ITOM.Visionaries
The APM and Observability Visionaries quadrant comprises vendors that provide products and have built a compelling plan to competitively address APM suite market requirements, but with a product portfolio that may still be a work in progress. They have a lower ability to execute than the Leaders. This is typically due to a lower ability to respond to market conditions, bring together the necessary product and platform requirements, andeffectively gain and expand on market share.
Niche PlayersThe Niche Players quadrant comprises primarily, but not exclusively, vendors with solutions catering to specific audiences or with limited use-case support. Because they do not demonstrate equal depth across all core capabilities (see the Market Definition section), they typically do not meet the APM needs of the broader market. Or they may do so within specific verticals or market segments or geographic regions only. In addition, vendors in this quadrant may have a more-limited ability to invest in the necessary functional and sales and marketing capabilities to expand beyond their current focus. Inclusion in this quadrant does not reflect negatively on the vendors’ value in the markets in which they choose to compete.Context
An Expanded View of APM and Observability
The title of this research changed this year to reflect the growing interest and adoption of observability in the domain of APM. Observability is the characteristic of software and systems that allows them to be “seen,” and enables questions about their behavior to be answered (see ). Observability enables organizations to analyze software and systems. based on the signals they emit and to ask questions about their behavior and state.Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 31 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of PI:EMAIL primary distinction between observability and traditional APM characterized in this research specifically is that observability-centric solutions support an exploratory, analytics-driven workflow that may bear more resemblance to business intelligence (BI) than IT operations. Many of the Leaders here provide powerful, AI-augmented APM that identifies and predicts pathologies quickly enough to resolve them with minimal user impact, alongside access to raw, high-cardinality telemetry and tools to explore and understand it. To be a Leader in this Magic Quadrant does not currently require both, although we have seen that the use of both dimensions together can create a virtuous cycle that may result in happier users.Beyond these technical considerations, Gartner has observed that the term “observability”is resonating outside of IT operations, in particular with senior IT leaders and application owners. The term “monitoring” has been in use for several decades in various forms, and, in many organizations, it carries baggage from multiple legacy systems. These were seen as expensive, difficult and time-consuming to implement, and providing limited value to the business. One finance company executive told Gartner, “It feels like we monitor everything, but see nothing.” Using “observability” as a synonym for “modern monitoring”allows for discussion of these concepts beyond the IT operations team. This isparticularly true when referring to cloud-native architectures, such as those comprising microservices, containers and container-orchestrators.
The Growing Integration of Security
This is the first year that security has been included as a component of the market. For decades, the domains of security and IT operations have worked in separate silos within most organizations. This has been the case even when the teams are using the same telemetry, most commonly seen with log files (e.g., SIEM).performance, but also the components and the vulnerabilities they contain.
APM tools and agents are already deployed across the most critical applications inside large enterprises. Expanding APM’s capabilities to identify exploitable vulnerabilities in deployed applications and, ideally, block them, seems a promising additional set of capabilities. Some anecdotes from Gartner client inquiry during the height of Log4Shell indicated that customers of APM-based RASP found that these tools were identifying vulnerable applications more quickly than their vulnerability management solutions.Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 32 of 37

Although it is unlikely that we will see an application performance and security monitoring (APSM) market emerge, the growing overlap and similarity of the IT operations and security operations toolchains, cohorts and strategies suggest that more collaboration is inevitable.Market Overview
The continued growth in mobile, cloud-native applications and workload migrations from traditional data center to cloud architectures continues to fuel the APM and observability market. In addition, growth in the adoption of APM tools has been witnessed in the following areas:■	Expansion within existing clients: In the past, only a small portion of applications, 	usually those that are client-facing or revenue-generating, were monitored via an 	APM solution. As APM products have evolved in capability, simplified deployment, 	accelerated time to value and decreased in price, we witnessed increased utilization 	of the tools in a larger percentage of applications. One client described an APM tool	“spreading like wildfire” internally, as different teams saw a successful deployment 	and became aware of the insights gained.■	Expansion into previously untapped industries: APM and observability tools most 	often were found inside large enterprises in industries such as banking, finance and 	global retail. These industries had a high level of maturity in IT systems and could 	recognize the benefits of deploying monitoring tools. Recently, as many industries 	have undergone digital transformations, adoption of these tools has expanded into 	new areas. Examples include government departments (from national to local level), 	healthcare and manufacturing.The consolidation of monitoring domains continues. It is further fueling market demand for APM products and adjacent segments, namely DEM and ITIM and, to a lesser extent, network performance monitoring (NPM). Given the above trends, Gartner expects the market for APM products to reach an estimated $8.9 billion by 2026, with a 8.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2020 and 2026 in constant currency (see ).The APM and observability market will continue to evolve during the next several years, driven by the following key trends:

■	Customer demand for more holistic tools, where good-enough functionality (for 	example, in log management or infrastructure monitoring) becomes good enough as 	part of a broader monitoring platform.■	The need to view multiple data types in context, without having to switch context 	and tooling.
■	With the above increase in the amount and types of data, APM tools will continue to 	become more aligned with analytics tools, rather than data collection technologies. 	This will continue to shift the value proposition away from purely proprietary agents 	for data collection and toward more open and flexible data-ingestion platforms.■	Use cases for APM will continue to expand beyond core IT operations, which 	continues to dominate demand. SRE/cloud operations and DevOps are becoming 	important use cases for customers looking to understand application performance 	across the entire stack and across multiple IT teams.■	SaaS products and other cloud services present particular challenges to I&O teams. 	These applications and workloads are often critical to businesses. However, they are 	difficult to monitor with traditional approaches. APM vendors are investing in 	capabilities to extend their monitoring to cover these environments.
