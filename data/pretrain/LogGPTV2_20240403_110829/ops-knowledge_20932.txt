User: A newbie question but.....
I've installed python2.7 on a host where the system version is 2.3 (2.7 at ~/python2.7/bin/python). I'd like to add a few packages such as MySQLdb but need setuptools. 
The directions say that you can use --prefix as an argument. However, if I do the following:
sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg --prefix=~/python2.7/bin/python
I get the error msg:
-bash-3.00$ sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg --prefix=~/python2.7/bin/python
setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg: line 3: exec: python2.7: not found
Am I not using the --prefix command correctly? Naturally, typing sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg --help can't find python either.
How do I tell setuptools where to find python explicitly? Any other issues I need to be aware of?
Assistant: I had the same error due to the fact that Python2.7 was not on the path used by sudo.
I just added:
alias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PATH'
before running the installer.
