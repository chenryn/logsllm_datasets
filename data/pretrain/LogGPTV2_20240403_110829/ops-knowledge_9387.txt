And give an early warning. 3. Use performance analysis tools: such as top, vmstat and other performance analysis tools, these tools can monitor server load, CPU usage, memory usage, I/O and other indicators in real time, and can help administrators find server bottlenecks and errors or performance issues. 4. Use resource monitoring tools: such as ps, netstat, lsof and other resource monitoring tools. These tools can check the server's ports, processes, open files, and network conditions, etc., and find abnormalities in time. 5. Use cloud monitoring services: such as Alibaba Cloud Monitoring, Tencent Cloud Monitoring and other cloud monitoring services, these services can monitor server load, CPU, memory, disk, network, etc., as well as application performance in real time, and can achieve comprehensive performance monitoring and early warning.
