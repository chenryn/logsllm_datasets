Every time I complete a challenge, I immediately return to my profile page and encounter the following error message:

"Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later."

To improve clarity and professionalism, you might consider rephrasing it as:

"Each time I finish a challenge and navigate back to my profile page, I receive the following error message:

'Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later.'"

This version is more concise and clearly conveys the sequence of events.
