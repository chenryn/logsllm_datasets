This is with Julia 0.6
I tagged one or two packages, and then tried to published them. This failed,
likely because PkgDev couldn't properly authorize with Github. I then tagged
and published the same package from Julia 0.4, where everything went fine. Now
I see this in Julia 0.6:
    julia> Pkg.update()
    INFO: Updating METADATA...
    WARNING: Cannot perform fast-forward merge.
This warning has been there for a few days. How do I avoid it? Is there a way
to do this automatically, or do I need to low-level git repo management? Would
a hard git reset to the upstream master branch be appropriate, or can this
lose data? (I would reset only the metadata repo, leaving my packages alone.)
I am making this an issue instead of a question on the mailing list because I
think that tagging and publishing should be mainstream (not expert) actions,
and Pkg and PkgDev should handle common error conditions automatically, or if
not, should at least detect them and point to respective documentation.
