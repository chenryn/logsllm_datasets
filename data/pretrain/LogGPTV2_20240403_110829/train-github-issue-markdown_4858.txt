The Debian Java team is preparing a package for Spring Framework 3.0.  
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=575877
However, before this can be completed, all the dependences of Spring have to
be packaged. In particular, we found that spring-build
(http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=586523) doesn't include a
file indicating the license and the copyright of this subproject.
Inspecting the source code available at
https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-build/trunk/, we found many files
without a clear license, some are licensed under GPL, others are licensed
under Apache 2.0, etc.
It's very important to have unambiguous copyright and license conditions for
the Debian packages, otherwise they cannot be accepted and distributed.
It would be very nice if you could provide a LICENSE file in the root
directory of this subproject clearly indicating the license and the copyright
statements for that software.
Thanks in advance,
