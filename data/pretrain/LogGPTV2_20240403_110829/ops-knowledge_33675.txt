User: On a CentOS server, build an Nginx reverse proxy server to distribute HTTP requests on port 80 to different web servers
Assistant: The following are the steps to build the Nginx reverse proxy server on the CentOS server: 1. Install Nginx Enter the following command in the terminal: ``` sudo yum install nginx ``` After the installation is complete, you can use the following command to view the operation of the Nginx service Status: ``` systemctl status nginx ``` 2. To configure Nginx reverse proxy, enter the following command in the terminal: ``` sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf ``` in the opened proxy. conf file, for example: ``` server { listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://192.168.1.100:80; } location /api { proxy_pass http://192.168.1.101:8080; } } `` ` The above configuration indicates that all HTTP requests on port 80 are forwarded to the web server at 192.168.1.100, while requests for /api are distributed to the web server at 192.168.1.101. After the configuration is complete, save and exit the proxy.conf file. 3. Restart the Nginx service Enter the following command in the terminal to restart the Nginx service: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` Now, after accessing the IP address or domain name of the CentOS server, the Nginx reverse proxy server will send the HTTP request to distributed to different web servers.
