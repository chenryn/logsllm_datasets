of those insecam cameras.
5.3 Manufacturers of Insecam Cameras
The complicated manufacturing and distribution chain in the IP camera market
has resulted in too many vendors selling IP cameras. We are not sure about how
insecam gets the manufacturer information of an IP camera or whether such
information is correct. But we observe that the access URL to video feeds of
an IP camera could be used for ﬁngerprinting the manufacturer information.
For instance, axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi, the substring of such a URL, indicates
that a camera is manufactured by Axis. We manually inspected several pieces
of manufacturer information provided by insecam and veriﬁed that they appear
correct. We provide the distribution of those insecam IP cameras by manufac-
tures in Fig. 5(b). Among the 20,923 IP cameras with the manufacturer metadata
information, the two manufacturers Defeway and Axis dominate the cameras,
occupying 29% and 22.7%, respectively. Most other manufacturers occupy no
more than 5% each.

5.4 TCP/UDP Ports Used by Insecam Cameras
We also examined on which port an insecam IP camera is working. Figure 6(a)
provides the top 10 most used ports. The top 10 ports are 80-84, 8000, 8080-8082,
and 60001. Port 80 (HTTP) is the most used port by IP cameras to communicate
to their administrative interface, occupying 32.8%. The uncommon port 60001
comes second, occupying about 15%. Further examination reveals that 96.5%
of insecam cameras using port 60001 are Defeway cameras, which is interesting
since the port seems to have the power of ﬁngerprinting the manufacturer of an
IP camera and thus could be exploited by miscreants.

Number of Ports (Used by Cameras) Associated with an IP
Fig. 6. (a) Top 10 ports used by insecam cameras. (b) CDF of the number of ports
per IP address of insecam cameras.
One IP address could be associated with multiple IP cameras, with each
one using a diﬀerent port. Figure 6(b) gives the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) of the number of ports used by IP cameras (i.e., the number of insecam
IP cameras) associate with one IP address. It shows that 87.5% IP addresses are
connected with only one IP camera, about 10% IP addresses are associated with
two IP cameras, and 3% IP addresses are with three or more IP cameras. Note
that the results represent a lower bound of the number of IP cameras associated
with an IP address, since it is probable that an IP address is indeed connected
with multiple cameras but only one IP camera gets posted on insecam.
5.5 Exhaust Historical IP Cameras Ever Posted on Insecam
In addition to the currently available and active IP cameras on insecam, we
manage to exhaust or at least very close to collect all the history records of
IP cameras ever appearing on insecam. We were able to collect the metadata
information for 290,344 IP cameras (28,386 active ones included), and present
the distribution of those cameras by country in Fig. 7(a).
The ﬁgure shows the top 10 countries which have the most IP cameras ever
disclosed on insecam since the creation of insecam in September 2014. We can see
that 9 out of the 10 countries have had more than 10,000 vulnerable IP cameras
posted by insecam. United States still tops the list, with more than 45,000 IP
cameras ever posted. China comes second, with more than 25,000 IP cameras

Total Number of Open Ports Associated with a Camera IP

ever listed on the site, which is quite strange given our current observation that
only 188 insecam IP cameras on average at any speciﬁc time are from China.
It is still unknown why there is a huge decrease in the number of IP cameras
from China on insecam. One clue is that the insecam administrator points out
two ways out for an IP camera, which are either contacting him to remove IP
cameras from insecam or simply setting the password of the camera. Compared
with the current top 10 countries shown in Fig. 4(a), Viet Nam and Brazil also
appear in the top 10 countries which contribute the most vulnerable cameras on
insecam in the past several years.
6 Vulnerability Analysis of Internal Network of IP
Cameras
In addition to the vulnerability of no password protection, we would like to
explore other possible vulnerabilities of those insecam IP cameras from the per-
spective of an attacker. To this end, we ﬁrst utilized an IP scanning tool [1]
with an attempt to discover the hidden hosts and services co-residing in the
same internal network as the vulnerable IP cameras. Speciﬁcally, the tool sends
probes to an IP address and returns information including (1) whether the host is
up, (2) responding TCP and UDP port numbers, (3) services and their versions
behind open ports, and so on. We may run the tool on an IP address multiple
times to make sure that the host is not down and we can gather the relevant
information.
6.1 Open Ports
Number of Open Ports per IP Address. We ﬁrst examine the open ports
associated returned for an IP address. Figure 4(a) depicts the CDF of the number
of open ports associate with the IP address of an IP camera. We can see that an
IP camera often has several other open ports. Speciﬁcally, 38.5% IP addresses
seems to be exclusively used for IP cameras; more than 60% IP addresses have
at least two open ports; about 40% IP addresses have three or more open ports;
about 10% IP addresses have at least 6 open ports. On average, an IP address
Internet Protocol Cameras with No Password Protection
57
has 3 open ports. 31 IP addresses have more than 100 open ports, and 14 IP
addresses have more than 200 open ports.
Remote Access Ports. In addition, we paid special attention to the services
(mainly SSH and TELNET) which tend to be exploited by attackers for malicious
activities such as DDoS attacks. Mirai, the IoT-based botnet that took the
Internet by storm in late 2016, was found to harvest bots by sending probes on
TCP ports 22 (SSH) and 23 (TELNET) [14]. In our test, 22.4% of alive hosts (i.e.,
responding to pings) have ports 22 and/or 23 open. These remote access ports
make those IP cameras vulnerable to the Mirai-like attacks.

Most Common Open Ports. Figure 8(a) shows the top 15 most common
open ports on the host of an insecam IP camera. Compared to Fig. 6(a), there
are many more kinds of port numbers (services) commonly accessible on the
host, such as 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 23 (TELNET), 443 (HTTPS), 554 (RTSP), and
1723 (PPTP). Some services are directly related to IP cameras, including HTTPS,
RTSP, and PPTP, while some could be easily exploited by attackers as a pivot
point to the internal network, such as FTP, SSH, and TELNET, especially when the
co-residing IP cameras could be directly accessed due to no password protection.
6.2 Web Servers
With the help of the IP scanning tool, we are able to detect a total of 300 diﬀerent
versions of web servers use by 2,564 IP cameras. The diﬀerent versions of web
servers were then aggregated to the web server software. Figure 8(b) shows the
top 10 web server software used by IP cameras. Numbers in parentheses denote
the number of web server versions used. Speciﬁcally, four diﬀerent versions of
Boa web server software are used most, about 21.4%. Apache HTTP server is also
prevalent, and up to 34 versions were used by 15.1% IP cameras. The thttpd
web server software comes third, with 11.7% rate.
58
H. Xu et al.
Furthermore, we studied the release dates of the popular versions of web
servers as well as the number of known CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Expo-
sures) vulnerabilities contained in them. We found that nearly all those cameras
were running extremely old and vulnerable web server software. For example, the
most popular web server software, Boa, has been discontinued since 2005 [3]. Most
popular web servers have been found to bear a signiﬁcant number of CVE vulnera-
bilities. Speciﬁcally, all 34 versions of Apache HTTP server have 3 to 49 vulnerabil-
ities, and 19 vulnerabilities on average [2]. All the two thttpd web server versions
contain 2 to 3 vulnerabilities. All 8 Microsoft IIS versions contain 1 to 9 vulner-
abilities, and 5 on average. 84.6% (11 out of 13) nginx web server versions used
have 1 to 3 known vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities could include authentica-
tion bypass vulnerability, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, buﬀer overﬂow,
directory traversal, and many other vulnerability types. They allow attackers to
gain administrator access and execute arbitrarily malicious code on IP cameras
and other internal network devices.
7 Related Work
Previous studies on IP cameras are the most related works. Stanislav et al. [19]
conducted a case study on baby monitor exposures and vulnerabilities. They
found that most vulnerabilities and exposures are trivial to exploit by a compe-
tent attacker and can only be eﬀectively mitigated by disabling the device and
applying a ﬁrmware update. Albrecht et al. [12] presented a real-world hack-
ing incident that the baby monitor was hacked and then turned on the owners,
and provided precautions to reduce the chance of getting hacked. Campbell [16]
focused on the vulnerability analysis of the authentication mechanisms of IP
cameras, discussed potential attacks, and presented mitigation solutions. Costin
[17] reviewed the threats and attacks against video surveillance systems at dif-
ferent levels and provided a set of recommendations to increase the security of
those systems. Nearly all above works aim to provide a good summary of exist-
ing attacks and possible mitigation solutions, but none of them conduct a deep,
large-scale quantitative analysis of vulnerable IP cameras as we do.
Many other works studied security issues in general IoT systems or in other
IoT devices. Amokrane [13] reviewed security challenges and attack surface in
IoT. The author showcased the accessibility of IoT attack surface with several
real-world cases on exploitation and attacking IoT devices. Apthorpe et al. [15]
investigated the privacy vulnerability of encrypted IoT traﬃc and found that the
network traﬃc rate of IoT devices can reveal user activities even when the traﬃc
is encrypted. Rotenberg et al. [18] performed an evaluation of authentication
bypass vulnerabilities in SOHO (Small Oﬃce/Home Oﬃce) routers and found
that a signiﬁcant number of routers could be potentially taken control over by
attackers due to misconﬁguration issues. Our work focuses on estimating the size
of vulnerable IP cameras and characterizing them.

8 Conclusion
IP cameras have come prevalent in our everyday lives. The need for comprehend-
ing and solving various security and privacy issues surrounding IP cameras has
become pressing. Our work represents one of such eﬀorts. In this paper, we con-
ducted a large-scale comprehensive measurement study of IP cameras without
password protection. We collected data from insecam, the world biggest directory
of live IP cameras without password protection. We ﬁrst studied the dynamics of
the site, then performed a detailed characteristic analysis on those IP cameras,
and ﬁnally conducted vulnerability analysis of the internal networks where IP
cameras reside. Our work produces a serials of interesting ﬁndings, which are
expected to provide valuable knowledge of the current threat landscape that IP
cameras are facing.
