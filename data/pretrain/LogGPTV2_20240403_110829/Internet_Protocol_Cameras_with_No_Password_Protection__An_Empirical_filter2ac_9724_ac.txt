# 5.3 Manufacturers of Insecam Cameras

The complex manufacturing and distribution chain in the IP camera market has led to a proliferation of vendors selling these devices. The accuracy and source of the manufacturer information provided by Insecam for each IP camera are uncertain. However, we have observed that the URL used to access the video feed of an IP camera can often be used to identify the manufacturer. For example, the substring "axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi" in a URL indicates that the camera is manufactured by Axis. We manually verified several pieces of manufacturer information provided by Insecam and found them to be correct.

Figure 5(b) shows the distribution of Insecam IP cameras by manufacturer. Among the 20,923 IP cameras with available manufacturer metadata, Defeway and Axis are the dominant manufacturers, accounting for 29% and 22.7% of the total, respectively. Most other manufacturers account for no more than 5% each.

# 5.4 TCP/UDP Ports Used by Insecam Cameras

We also analyzed the ports used by Insecam IP cameras. Figure 6(a) provides the top 10 most frequently used ports. These include ports 80-84, 8000, 8080-8082, and 60001. Port 80 (HTTP) is the most commonly used port, utilized by 32.8% of IP cameras for communication with their administrative interface. The second most common port is 60001, which is used by approximately 15% of the cameras. Further investigation revealed that 96.5% of the cameras using port 60001 are Defeway cameras, suggesting that this port can serve as a fingerprint for identifying the manufacturer and could potentially be exploited by malicious actors.

# 5.5 Exhaust Historical IP Cameras Ever Posted on Insecam

In addition to the currently active IP cameras on Insecam, we collected historical records of IP cameras that have been posted on the site since its inception in September 2014. We managed to gather metadata for 290,344 IP cameras, including 28,386 active ones. Figure 7(a) presents the distribution of these cameras by country.

The figure shows the top 10 countries with the most IP cameras ever disclosed on Insecam. Nine out of the ten countries have had more than 10,000 vulnerable IP cameras listed. The United States leads with over 45,000 cameras, followed by China with more than 25,000. It is noteworthy that, despite the large number of Chinese cameras listed historically, only about 188 Chinese cameras are typically active on Insecam at any given time. The reasons for this significant decrease are unclear, but one possible explanation is that the Insecam administrator offers two ways to remove a camera: contacting him directly or setting a password.

# 6. Vulnerability Analysis of Internal Network of IP Cameras

## 6.1 Open Ports

### Number of Open Ports per IP Address

We examined the open ports associated with the IP addresses of Insecam IP cameras. Figure 4(a) shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of open ports per IP address. About 38.5% of IP addresses appear to be exclusively used for IP cameras, while more than 60% have at least two open ports. Approximately 40% have three or more open ports, and about 10% have at least six open ports. On average, an IP address has three open ports. Notably, 31 IP addresses have more than 100 open ports, and 14 have more than 200 open ports.

### Remote Access Ports

We paid special attention to services such as SSH and TELNET, which are often exploited for malicious activities like DDoS attacks. Mirai, a well-known IoT-based botnet, was known to harvest bots by probing TCP ports 22 (SSH) and 23 (TELNET). In our test, 22.4% of responsive hosts had ports 22 and/or 23 open, making these IP cameras vulnerable to Mirai-like attacks.

### Most Common Open Ports

Figure 8(a) shows the top 15 most common open ports on the host of an Insecam IP camera. These include ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 23 (TELNET), 443 (HTTPS), 554 (RTSP), and 1723 (PPTP). Some of these services, such as HTTPS, RTSP, and PPTP, are directly related to IP cameras, while others, like FTP, SSH, and TELNET, can be easily exploited by attackers to gain access to the internal network, especially when the cameras lack password protection.

## 6.2 Web Servers

Using an IP scanning tool, we detected 300 different versions of web servers used by 2,564 IP cameras. These were aggregated into the corresponding web server software. Figure 8(b) shows the top 10 web server software used by IP cameras, with the number of versions in parentheses. Boa web server software, with four different versions, is the most common, used by about 21.4% of the cameras. Apache HTTP server, with up to 34 versions, is also prevalent, used by 15.1% of the cameras. Thttpd web server software comes third, with a 11.7% usage rate.

Further analysis of the release dates and known CVE vulnerabilities of these web servers revealed that many cameras are running outdated and vulnerable software. For instance, Boa web server has been discontinued since 2005. Many popular web servers, such as Apache HTTP, thttpd, and Microsoft IIS, contain a significant number of known vulnerabilities, including authentication bypass, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflow, and directory traversal. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to gain administrative access and execute arbitrary malicious code on the IP cameras and other devices in the internal network.

# 7. Related Work

Previous studies on IP cameras are the most relevant to our work. Stanislav et al. [19] conducted a case study on baby monitor exposures and vulnerabilities, finding that most vulnerabilities are easily exploitable and can only be mitigated by disabling the device and applying firmware updates. Albrecht et al. [12] presented a real-world hacking incident involving a baby monitor and provided precautions to reduce the risk of such attacks. Campbell [16] focused on the vulnerability analysis of the authentication mechanisms of IP cameras, discussing potential attacks and mitigation solutions. Costin [17] reviewed threats and attacks against video surveillance systems and provided recommendations to enhance security. While these works provide valuable summaries of existing attacks and mitigation strategies, none of them conduct a deep, large-scale quantitative analysis of vulnerable IP cameras as we do.

Other studies have focused on security issues in general IoT systems or specific IoT devices. Amokrane [13] reviewed security challenges and attack surfaces in IoT, showcasing real-world cases of exploitation. Apthorpe et al. [15] investigated the privacy vulnerabilities of encrypted IoT traffic, finding that even encrypted traffic can reveal user activities. Rotenberg et al. [18] evaluated authentication bypass vulnerabilities in SOHO routers, finding that many routers are vulnerable due to misconfiguration issues. Our work focuses on estimating the size of the vulnerable IP camera population and characterizing these vulnerabilities.

# 8. Conclusion

IP cameras have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, and addressing the security and privacy issues surrounding these devices is crucial. This paper presents a large-scale, comprehensive measurement study of IP cameras without password protection, using data from Insecam, the world's largest directory of live IP cameras without password protection. We studied the dynamics of the site, performed a detailed characteristic analysis of the IP cameras, and conducted a vulnerability analysis of the internal networks where these cameras reside. Our findings provide valuable insights into the current threat landscape faced by IP cameras.
