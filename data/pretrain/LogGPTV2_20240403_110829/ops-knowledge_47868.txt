User: We have around 250 identical linux server which runs a business critical web application for a bank. Basically we do a lot of scripting work but now i want to centralize that only in one location. That means run on one server and and deploy it in many. I know you guys must be thinking that this is an easy task and can be done with a shell script. But again we need to create many different different scripts to do our work
I know python has a big library and this can be possible but i dont know how. To cut in short i need all scripts in one file and based on the argument it will execute it according.
For example in a python program we have a function where we can mix them to perform different result.
So you please let me know how to go about it
Assistant: You could also try any of the distributed computing packages.  Pyro is one of them that might interest you.
