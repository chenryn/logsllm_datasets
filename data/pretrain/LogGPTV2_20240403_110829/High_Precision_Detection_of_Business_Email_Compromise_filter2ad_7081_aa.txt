Abstract
Business email compromise (BEC) and employee imper-
sonation have become one of the most costly cyber-security
threats, causing over $12 billion in reported losses. Imperson-
ation emails take several forms: for example, some ask for
a wire transfer to the attacker’s account, while others lead
the recipient to following a link, which compromises their
credentials. Email security systems are not effective in detect-
ing these attacks, because the attacks do not contain a clearly
malicious payload, and are personalized to the recipient.
We present BEC-Guard, a detector used at Barracuda Net-
works that prevents business email compromise attacks in
real-time using supervised learning. BEC-Guard has been
in production since July 2017, and is part of the Barracuda
Sentinel email security product. BEC-Guard detects attacks
by relying on statistics about the historical email patterns that
can be accessed via cloud email provider APIs. The two main
challenges when designing BEC-Guard are the need to label
millions of emails to train its classiﬁers, and to properly train
the classiﬁers when the occurrence of employee imperson-
ation emails is very rare, which can bias the classiﬁcation. Our
key insight is to split the classiﬁcation problem into two parts,
one analyzing the header of the email, and the second apply-
ing natural language processing to detect phrases associated
with BEC or suspicious links in the email body. BEC-Guard
utilizes the public APIs of cloud email providers both to au-
tomatically learn the historical communication patterns of
each organization, and to quarantine emails in real-time. We
evaluated BEC-Guard on a commercial dataset containing
more than 4,000 attacks, and show it achieves a precision of
98.2% and a false positive rate of less than one in ﬁve million
emails.
1 Introduction
In recent years, email-borne employee impersonation, termed
by the FBI “Business Email Compromise” (BEC), has be-
come a major security threat. According to the FBI, US or-
ganizations have lost $2.7 billion in 2018 and cumulatively
$12 billion since 2013 [13]. Numerous well-known enter-
prises have fallen prey to such attacks, including Facebook,
Google [41], and Ubiquiti [44]. Studies have shown that BEC
is the cause of much higher direct ﬁnancial loss than other
common cyberattacks, such as ransomware [11, 13]. BEC
attacks have also ensnared operators of critical government in-
frastructure [39]. Even consumers have become the targets of
employee impersonation. For example, attackers have imper-
sonated employees of real-estate ﬁrms to trick home buyers
to wire down payments to the wrong bank account [1, 7, 17].
BEC takes several forms: some emails ask the recipient
to wire transfer money to the attacker’s account, others ask
for W-2 forms that contain social security numbers, and some
lead the recipient to follow a phishing link, in order to steal
their credentials. The common theme is the impersonation
of a manager or colleague of the target [12]. In this work,
we focus on attacks where the attacker is external to the or-
ganization, and is trying to impersonate an employee. In §6
we discuss other scenarios, such as where the attacker uses a
compromised internal email account to impersonate employ-
ees [18, 19].
Most email security systems are not effective in detecting
BEC. When analyzing an incoming email, email security sys-
tems broadly look for two types of attributes: malicious and
volumetric. Examples of malicious attributes are an attach-
ment that contains malware, a link pointing to a compromised
website, or an email that is sent from a domain with a low
reputation. There are various well-known techniques to detect
malicious attributes, including sandboxing [49], and domain
reputation [2,48]. Volumetric attributes are detected when the
same email format is sent to hundreds of recipients or more.
Examples include the same text or sender email (e.g., spam),
and the same URL (e.g., mass phishing campaigns). However,
employee impersonation emails do not contain malicious or
volumetric attributes: they typically do not contain malware,
are not sent from well-known malicious IPs, often do not con-
tain a link, and are sent to a small number of recipients (with
the explicit intent of evading volumetric ﬁlters). When em-
ployee impersonation attacks do contain a link, it is typically

a link to a fake sign up page on a legitimate website that was
compromised, which does not appear on any IP black lists. In
addition, the text of the attacks is tailored to the recipient, and
is typically not caught by volume-based ﬁlters.
Our design goal is to detect and quarantine BEC attacks in
real-time, at a low false positive rate (1 in a million emails)
and high precision (95%). We make the observations that
popular cloud email systems, such as Ofﬁce 365 and Gmail,
provide APIs that enable account administrators to allow ex-
ternal applications to access historical emails. Therefore, we
design a system that detects BEC by relying on historical
emails available through these APIs.
Prior work on detecting impersonation has been conducted
either on very small datasets [10, 14, 20, 45]), or focused on
stopping a subset of BEC attacks (domain spooﬁng [14] or
emails with links [20]). In addition, most prior work suffers
from very low precision (only 1 in 500 alerts is an attack [20])
or very high false positive rates [10, 45]), which makes prior
work unsuitable for detecting BEC in real-time.
The main challenge in designing a system that can detect
BEC at a low false positive rate is that BEC emails are very
rare as a percentage of all emails. In fact, in our dataset, less
than one out of 50,000 emails is a BEC attack. Therefore, in
order to achieve low false positives, we design a system using
supervised learning, which relies on a large training set of
BEC emails. However, bootstrapping a supervised learning
systems presents two practical challenges. First, it is difﬁcult
to label a sufﬁciently large training dataset that includes mil-
lions of emails. Second, it is challenging to train a classiﬁer on
an imbalanced dataset, in which the training dataset contains
almost ﬁve orders of magnitude fewer positive samples (i.e.,
BEC attacks) than negative samples (i.e., innocent emails).
In this paper, we present how we initially trained BEC-
Guard, a security system that automatically detects and quar-
antines BEC attacks in real-time using historical emails. BEC-
Guard is part of a commercial product, Barracuda Sentinel,
used by thousands of corporate customers of Barracuda Net-
works to prevent BEC, account takeover, spear phishing and
other targeted attacks. BEC-Guard does not require an ana-
lyst to review the detected emails, but rather relies on ofﬂine
and infrequent re-training of classiﬁers. The key insight of
BEC-Guard is to split the training and classiﬁcation into two
parts: header and body.
Instead of directly classifying BEC attacks, the imperson-
ation classiﬁer detects impersonation attempts, by determin-
ing if an attacker is impersonating an employee in the com-
pany by inspecting the header of the email. It utilizes features
that include information about which email addresses em-
ployees typically utilize, how popular their name is, and char-
acteristics of the sender domain. The content classiﬁers are
only run on emails that were categorized as impersonation at-
tempts, and inspects the body of the email for BEC. For emails
that do not contain links, we use a k-nearest neighbors [43]
(KNN) classiﬁer that weighs words using term frequency-
inverse document frequency [28, 42] (TFIDF). For emails
with links, we train a random forest classiﬁer that relies on the
popularity as well as the position of the link in the text. Both
of the content classiﬁers can be retrained frequently using
customer feedback.
To create the initial classiﬁers, we individually label and
train each type of classiﬁer: the labels of the impersonation
classiﬁer are generated using scripts we ran on the training
dataset, while the content classiﬁers are trained over a manu-
ally labeled training dataset. Since we run the content classi-
ﬁcation only on emails that were detected as impersonation
attempts, we need to manually label a much smaller subset of
the training dataset. In addition, to ensure the impersonation
classiﬁer is trained successfully over the imbalanced dataset,
we develop an under-sampling technique for legitimate emails
using Gaussian Mixture Models, an unsupervised clustering
algorithm. The classiﬁers are typically re-trained every few
weeks. The dataset available for initial training consists of
a year worth of historical emails from 1500 customers, with
an aggregate dataset of 2 million mailboxes and 2.5 billion
emails. Since training the initial classiﬁers, our dataset has
been expanded to include tens of millions of mailboxes.
BEC-Guard uses the APIs of cloud-based email systems
(e.g., Ofﬁce 365 and Gmail), both to automatically learn the
historical communication patterns of each organization within
hours, and to quarantine emails in real-time. BEC-Guard sub-
scribes to API calls, which automatically alert BEC-Guard
whenever a new email enters the organization’s mailbox. Once
notiﬁed by the API call, BEC-Guard classiﬁes the email for
BEC. If the email is determined to be BEC, BEC-Guard uses
the APIs to move the email from the inbox folder to a dedi-
cated quarantine folder on the end-user’s account.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we measured
BEC-Guard’s performance on a dataset of emails taken from
several hundred organizations. Within this labeled dataset,
BEC-Guard achieves a a precision of 98.2%, a false positive
rate of only one in 5.3 million. To summarize, we make the
following contributions:
high precision and low false positive rates.
• First real-time system for preventing BEC that achieves
• BEC-Guard’s novel design relies on cloud email provider
APIs both to learn the historical communication patterns
of each organization, and to detect attacks in real-time.
• To cope with labeling millions of emails, we split the
detection problem into two sets of classiﬁers run sequen-
tially.
• We use different types of classiﬁers for the header and
text of the email. The headers are classiﬁed using a ran-
dom forest, while the text classiﬁcation relies primarily
on a KNN model that is not dependent on any hard-coded
features, and can be easily re-trained.
• To train the impersonation classiﬁer on an imbalanced
dataset, we utilize a sampling technique for the legiti-
mate emails using a clustering algorithm.

2 Background
Business email compromise, also known as employee im-
personation, CEO fraud, and whaling,1 is a class of email
attacks where an attacker impersonates an employee of the
company (e.g., the CEO, a manager in HR or ﬁnance), and
crafts a personalized email to a speciﬁc employee. The intent
of this email is typically to trick the target to wire money,
send sensitive information (e.g., HR or medical records), or
lead the employee to follow a phishing link in order to steal
their credentials or download malware to their endpoint.
BEC has become one of the most damaging email-borne
attacks in recent years, equaling or surpassing other types of
attacks, such as spam and ransomware. Due to the severity of
BEC attacks, the FBI started compiling annual reports based
on US-based organizations that have reported their fraudulent
wire transfers to the FBI. Based on the FBI data, between
2013 and 2018, $12 billion have been lost [13]. To put this in
perspective, a Google study estimates that the total amount of
ransomware payments in 2016 was only $25 million [11].
In this section, we review common examples of BEC, and
provide intuition on how their unique characteristics can be
exploited for supervised learning classiﬁcation.
2.1 Statistics
To better understand the goals and methodology of BEC at-
tacks, we compiled statistics for 3,000 randomly selected
BEC attacks in our dataset (for more information about our
dataset, see §4.2). Table 1 summarizes the objectives of the
attacks. The results show that the most common BEC in the
sampled attacks is try to deceive the recipient to perform a
wire transfer to a bank account owned by the attacker, while
about 0.8% of the attacks ask the recipient to send the attacker

personal identiﬁable information (PII), typically in the form
of W-2 forms that contain social security numbers. About
40% of attacks ask the recipient to click on a link. 12% of
attacks try to establish rapport with the target by starting a
conversation with the recipient (e.g., the attacker will ask the
recipient whether they are available for an urgent task). For
the “rapport” emails, in the vast majority of cases, after the
initial email is responded to the attacker will ask to perform a
wire transfer.
An important observation is that about 60% of BEC attacks
do not involve a link: the attack is simply a plain text email
that fools the recipient to commit a wire transfer or send
sensitive information. These plain text emails are especially
difﬁcult for existing email security systems, as well as prior
academic work to detect [20], because they are often sent
from legitimate email accounts, tailored to each recipient, and
do not contain any suspicious links.
We also sampled attacks from 50 random companies in
