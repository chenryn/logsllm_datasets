3.3.2 Two-Index Transforms and Values
We now consider transforms and special values relating the 𝑚th and 𝑚′th cyclotomic
rings, for 𝑚|𝑚′. These are used for computing the embed and twace functions, the relative
powerful basis, and the relative CRT set.
Prime-Power Factorization
As in the subsection 3.3.1, every transform of interest for arbitrary 𝑚|𝑚′ factors into the
tensor product of the corresponding transforms for prime-power indices having the same
prime base. More speciﬁcally, let 𝑇𝑚,𝑚′ denote the matrix of any of the linear transforms
67
we consider below. Suppose we have factorization 𝑚 = ∏︀
ℓ where
ℓ is a power of a distinct prime 𝑝ℓ (so some 𝑚ℓ may be 1). Then we have the
ℓ 𝑚ℓ, 𝑚′ = ∏︀
ℓ 𝑚′

⨂︁
𝑇𝑚,𝑚′ =

ℓ
which follows directly from the Kronecker-product factorizations of the powerful and
decoding bases, and the mixed-product property. Therefore, from this point onward we deal
only with prime-power indices 𝑚 = 𝑝𝑒, 𝑚′ = 𝑝𝑒′ for a prime 𝑝 and integers 𝑒′ > 𝑒 ≥ 0.
We mention that for the transforms we consider below, the fully expanded matrices 𝑇𝑚,𝑚′
have very compact representations and can be applied directly to the input vector, without
computing a sequence of intermediate vectors via the sparse decomposition. For efﬁciency,
our implementation does exactly this.
Coefﬁcients in Relative Bases
We start with transforms that let us represent elements with respect to relative bases, i.e., to
represent an element of the 𝑚′th cyclotomic as a vector of elements in the 𝑚th cyclotomic,
with respect to a relative basis. Due to the Kronecker-product structure of the powerful,
decoding, and CRT bases, it turns out that the same transformation works for all of them.
The coeffs method of Tensor implements this transformation.
One can verify the identity (⃗𝑥 ⊗ ⃗𝑦)𝑡 · a = ⃗𝑥𝑡 · 𝐴 · ⃗𝑦, where 𝐴 is the “matricization” of
the vector a, whose rows are (the transposes of) the consecutive dim(⃗𝑦)-dimensional blocks
of a. Letting ⃗𝑏ℓ denote either the powerful, decoding, or CRT basis in the ℓth cyclotomic,
which has factorization ⃗𝑏𝑚′ = ⃗𝑏𝑚′,𝑚 ⊗ ⃗𝑏𝑚, we have
𝑚′ · a = ⃗𝑏𝑡
⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚′,𝑚 · (𝐴 · ⃗𝑏𝑚).
68
Therefore, 𝐴 ·⃗𝑏𝑚 is the desired vector of 𝑅-coefﬁcients of 𝑎 = ⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚′ · a ∈ 𝑅′. In other words,
the 𝜙(𝑚)-dimensional blocks of a are the coefﬁcient vectors (with respect to basis ⃗𝑏𝑚) of
the 𝑅-coefﬁcients of 𝑎 with respect to the relative basis ⃗𝑏𝑚′,𝑚.
Embed Transforms
We now consider transforms that convert from a basis in the 𝑚th cyclotomic to the same
type of basis in the 𝑚′th cyclotomic. That is, for particular bases ⃗𝑏𝑚′,⃗𝑏𝑚 of the 𝑚′th and
𝑚th cyclotomics (respectively), we write
⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚 = ⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚′ · 𝑇
for some integer matrix 𝑇 . So embedding a ring element from the 𝑚th to the 𝑚′th cyclotomic
(with respect to these bases) corresponds to left-multiplication by 𝑇 . The embedB methods
of Tensor, for B ∈ {Pow, Dec, CRT}, implement these transforms.
We start with the powerful basis. Because ⃗𝑝𝑚′ = ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 ⊗ ⃗𝑝𝑚 and the ﬁrst entry of ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚
is unity,
⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚 = (⃗𝑝𝑡
= ⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚 · 𝐼𝜙(𝑚))
𝑚′,𝑚 · e1) ⊗ (⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚′ · (e1 ⊗ 𝐼𝜙(𝑚)) ,
where e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ Z𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑚). Note that (e1 ⊗ 𝐼𝜙(𝑚)) is the identity matrix stacked
on top of an all-zeros matrix, so left-multiplication by it simply pads the input vector by
zeros.
For the decoding bases ⃗𝑑𝑚′, ⃗𝑑𝑚, an identical derivation holds when 𝑚 > 1, because
𝑝 · v, where
⃗𝑑𝑚′ = ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 ⊗ ⃗𝑑𝑚. Otherwise, we have ⃗𝑑𝑚′ = ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑝 ⊗ ⃗𝑑𝑝 and ⃗𝑑𝑡
𝑚 = (1) = ⃗𝑑𝑡
69
v = (1,−1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ Z𝜙(𝑝). Combining these cases, we have
𝑚 = ⃗𝑑𝑡
⃗𝑑𝑡
𝑚′ ·
⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩e1 ⊗ 𝐼𝜙(𝑚)
e1 ⊗ v
if 𝑚 > 1
if 𝑚 = 1.
For the CRT bases ⃗𝑐𝑚′, ⃗𝑐𝑚, because ⃗𝑐𝑚 = ⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑚 ⊗ ⃗𝑐𝑚 and the sum of the elements of
any (relative) CRT basis is unity, we have
𝑚 = (⃗𝑐𝑡
⃗𝑐𝑡
𝑚 · 𝐼𝜙(𝑚))
𝑚′,𝑚 · 1) ⊗ (⃗𝑐𝑡
𝑚′ · (1 ⊗ 𝐼𝜙(𝑚)) .
= ⃗𝑐𝑡
Notice that (1 ⊗ 𝐼𝜙(𝑚)) is just a stack of identity matrices, so left-multiplication by it just
stacks up several copies of the input vector.
Finally, we express the relative powerful basis ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 with respect to the powerful
basis ⃗𝑝𝑚′; this is used in the powBasisPow method of Tensor. We simply have
⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚′,𝑚 = (⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚′,𝑚 · 𝐼𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑚)) ⊗ (⃗𝑝𝑚 · e1)
𝑚′ · (𝐼𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑚) ⊗ e1) .
= ⃗𝑝𝑡
Twace Transforms
We now consider transforms that represent the twace function from the 𝑚′th to the 𝑚th
cyclotomic for the three basis types of interest. That is, for particular bases ⃗𝑏𝑚′,⃗𝑏𝑚 of the
𝑚′th and 𝑚th cyclotomics (respectively), we write
Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚′) = ⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚 · 𝑇
70
for some integer matrix 𝑇 , which by linearity of twace implies
Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚′ · v) = ⃗𝑏𝑡
𝑚 · (𝑇 · v).
In other words, the twace function (relative to the these bases) corresponds to left-multiplication
by 𝑇 . The twacePowDec and twaceCRT methods of Tensor implement these transforms.
To start, we claim that
Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚) = Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑑𝑚′,𝑚) = e1 ∈ Z𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑚).
(3.3.4)
This holds for ⃗𝑑𝑚′,𝑚 because it is dual to (conjugated) ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 under Tw𝑚′,𝑚, and the ﬁrst
entry of ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 is unity. It holds for ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 because ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 = ⃗𝑑𝑚′,𝑚 for 𝑚 > 1, and for 𝑚 = 1
one can verify that
Tw𝑚′,1(⃗𝑝𝑚′,1) = Tw𝑝,1(Tw𝑚′,𝑝(⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑝) ⊗ ⃗𝑝𝑝,1) = (1, 0, . . . , 0) ⊗ Tw𝑝,1(⃗𝑝𝑝,1) = e1.
Now for the powerful basis, by linearity of twace and Equation (3.3.4) we have
Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚′) = Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚′,𝑚) ⊗ ⃗𝑝𝑡
𝑚 · 𝐼𝜙(𝑚))
𝑚
= (1 · e𝑡
𝑚 · (e𝑡
1) ⊗ (⃗𝑝𝑡
1 ⊗ 𝐼𝜙(𝑚)) .
= ⃗𝑝𝑡
An identical derivation holds for the decoding basis as well. Notice that left-multiplication
by the matrix (e𝑡
1 ⊗ 𝐼𝜙(𝑚)) just returns the ﬁrst 𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑚) entries of the input vector.
Finally, we consider the CRT basis. Because 𝑔𝑚′ = 𝑔𝑝 (recall that 𝑚′ ≥ 𝑝), by deﬁnition
of twace in terms of trace we have
Tw𝑚′,𝑚(𝑥) = ( ˆ𝑚/ ˆ𝑚′) · 𝑔−1
𝑚 · Tr𝑚′,𝑚(𝑔𝑝 · 𝑥).
(3.3.5)
71
Also recall that the traces of all relative CRT set elements are unity: Tr𝑚′,ℓ(⃗𝑐𝑚′,ℓ) =
1𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(ℓ) for any ℓ|𝑚′. We now need to consider two cases. For 𝑚 > 1, we have 𝑔𝑚 = 𝑔𝑝,
so by Equation (3.3.5) and linearity of trace,
Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑚) = ( ˆ𝑚/ ˆ𝑚′) · 1𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑚) .
For 𝑚 = 1, we have 𝑔𝑚 = 1, so by ⃗𝑐𝑚′,1 = ⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑝 ⊗ ⃗𝑐𝑝,1 and linearity of trace we have
Tw𝑚′,1(⃗𝑐𝑚′,1) = ( ˆ𝑚/ ˆ𝑚′) · Tr𝑝,1(Tr𝑚′,𝑝(⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑝) ⊗ (𝑔𝑝 · ⃗𝑐𝑝,1))
= ( ˆ𝑚/ ˆ𝑚′) · 1𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑝) ⊗ Tr𝑝,1(𝑔𝑝 · ⃗𝑐𝑝,1) .
Applying the two cases, we ﬁnally have
Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑐𝑡
𝑚′) = (1 · Tw𝑚′,𝑚(⃗𝑐𝑡
= ⃗𝑐𝑡
𝑚 · ( ˆ𝑚/ ˆ𝑚′) ·
⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩1𝑡

if 𝑚 = 1.

Again because Tr𝑝,1(⃗𝑐𝑝,1) = 1𝜙(𝑝), the entries of Tr𝑝,1(𝑔𝑝 · ⃗𝑐𝑝,1) are merely the CRT coefﬁ-
cients of 𝑔𝑝. That is, the 𝑖th entry (indexed from one) is 1 − 𝜔𝑖
for the
value of 𝜔𝑚′ used to deﬁne the CRT set of the 𝑚′th cyclotomic.

3.3.3 CRT Sets
In this ﬁnal subsection we describe an algorithm for computing a representation of the
relative CRT set ⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑚 modulo a prime-power integer. CRT sets are a generalization of CRT
bases to the case where the prime modulus may not be 1 modulo the cyclotomic index (i.e.,
it does not split completely), and therefore the cardinality of the set may be less than the
dimension of the ring. CRT sets are used for homomorphic SIMD operations [SV14] and in
72
the bootstrapping algorithm of [AP13]. See subsection 2.2.6 for the necessary background
information.
Computing CRT Sets
We start with an easy calculation that, for a prime integer 𝑝, “lifts” the mod-𝑝 CRT set to the
mod-𝑝𝑒 CRT set.
Lemma 3.3.1. For 𝑅 = 𝒪𝑚, a prime integer 𝑝 where 𝑝 (cid:45) 𝑚, and a positive integer 𝑒, let
(𝑐𝑖)𝑖 be the CRT set of 𝑅𝑝𝑒, and let ¯𝑐𝑖 ∈ 𝑅 be any representative of 𝑐𝑖. Then (¯𝑐𝑝
𝑖 mod 𝑝𝑒+1𝑅)𝑖
is the CRT set of 𝑅𝑝𝑒+1.
Corollary 3.3.2. If ¯𝑐𝑖 ∈ 𝑅 are representatives for the mod-𝑝 CRT set (𝑐𝑖)𝑖 of 𝑅𝑝, then
(¯𝑐𝑝𝑒−1
𝑖 mod 𝑝𝑒𝑅)𝑖 is the CRT set of 𝑅𝑝𝑒.
Proof of Lemma 3.3.1. Let 𝑝𝑅 =∏︀
p𝑖 ⊂ 𝑅. By hypothesis, we have ¯𝑐𝑖 ∈ 𝛿𝑖,𝑖′ + p𝑒
𝑖′ for all 𝑖, 𝑖′. Then
𝑖 p𝑖 be the factorization of 𝑝𝑅 into distinct prime ideals
𝑖 ∈ 𝛿𝑖,𝑖′ + 𝑝 · p𝑒
¯𝑐𝑝
𝑖′ + p𝑒𝑝
𝑖′ ⊆ 𝛿𝑖,𝑖′ + p𝑒+1
𝑖′
,
because 𝑝 divides the binomial coefﬁcient(︀𝑝
)︀ for 0 < 𝑘 < 𝑝, because 𝑝𝑅 ⊆ p𝑖′, and because
𝑘
𝑖′ ⊆ p𝑒+1
p𝑒𝑝
𝑖′
.
CRT sets modulo a prime. We now describe the mod-𝑝 CRT set for a prime integer 𝑝,
and an efﬁcient algorithm for computing representations of its elements. To motivate
the approach, notice that the coefﬁcient vector of 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅𝑝 with respect to some arbitrary
Z𝑝-basis ⃗𝑏 of 𝑅𝑝 can be obtained via the twace and the dual Z𝑝-basis ⃗𝑏∨ (under the twace):
𝑥 = ⃗𝑏𝑡 · Tw𝑅𝑝/Z𝑝(𝑥 · ⃗𝑏∨).
73
In what follows we let ⃗𝑏 be the decoding basis, because its dual basis is the conjugated
powerful basis, which has a particularly simple form. The following lemma is a direct
consequence of Equation (2.2.6) and the deﬁnition of twace (Equation (2.2.4)).
Lemma 3.3.3. For 𝑅 = 𝒪𝑚 and a prime integer 𝑝 (cid:45) 𝑚, let ⃗𝑐 = (𝑐𝑖) be the CRT set of 𝑅𝑝,
let ⃗𝑑 = ⃗𝑑𝑚 denote the decoding Z𝑝-basis of 𝑅𝑝, and let 𝜏 (⃗𝑝) = (𝑝−1
𝑗 ) denote its dual, the
conjugate powerful basis. Then
⃗𝑐𝑡 = ⃗𝑑𝑡 · Tw𝑅𝑝/Z𝑝(𝜏 (⃗𝑝) · ⃗𝑐𝑡) = ⃗𝑑𝑡 · ˆ𝑚−1 · TrF
𝑝𝑑 /F𝑝(𝐶),
where 𝐶 is the matrix over F𝑞𝑑 whose (𝑗, ¯𝚤)th element is 𝜌¯𝚤(𝑔𝑚) · 𝜌¯𝚤(𝑝−1
𝑗 ).
Notice that 𝜌¯𝚤(𝑝−1
𝑗 ) is merely the inverse of the (¯𝚤, 𝑗)th entry of the matrix CRT𝑚
over F𝑝𝑑, which is the Kronecker product of CRT𝑚ℓ over all maximal prime-power divisors
of 𝑚. In turn, the entries of CRT𝑚ℓ are all just appropriate powers of 𝜔𝑚ℓ ∈ F𝑝𝑑. Similarly,
𝜌¯𝚤(𝑔𝑚) is the product of all 𝜌¯𝚤 mod 𝑚ℓ(𝑔𝑚ℓ) = 1 − 𝜔¯𝚤
𝑚ℓ. So we can straightforwardly compute
the entries of the matrix 𝐶 and takes their traces into F𝑝, yielding the decoding-basis
coefﬁcient vectors for the CRT set elements.
Relative CRT sets. We conclude by describing the relative CRT set ⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑚 modulo a
prime 𝑝, where 𝑅 = 𝒪𝑚, 𝑅′ = 𝒪𝑚′ for 𝑚|𝑚′ and 𝑝 (cid:45) 𝑚′. The key property of ⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑚 is that
the CRT sets ⃗𝑐𝑚′, ⃗𝑐𝑚 for 𝑅𝑝, 𝑅′
𝑝 (respectively) satisfy the Kronecker-product factorization
⃗𝑐𝑚′ = ⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑚 ⊗ ⃗𝑐𝑚 .
(3.3.6)
The deﬁnition of ⃗𝑐𝑚′,𝑚 arises from the splitting of the prime ideal divisors p𝑖 (of 𝑝𝑅) in 𝑅′,
as described next.
Recall from above that the prime ideal divisors p′
𝑖′ ⊂ 𝑅′ of 𝑝𝑅′ and the CRT set
𝑚′/⟨𝑝⟩, and similarly for p𝑖 ⊂ 𝑅 and ⃗𝑐𝑚 = (𝑐𝑖). For
