When upgrading `styled-components` to version 2.1.0 in the 'with-styled-components' example, you may encounter the following error: 

`Unfortunately, nesting is not supported by styled-jsx`.

To resolve this issue, consider the following steps:

1. Ensure that you are using a compatible version of `styled-jsx` that supports the features you need.
2. If `styled-jsx` does not support nested styles, you might need to restructure your CSS or use an alternative approach for styling.
3. Consider using `styled-components` directly without `styled-jsx` if nesting is essential for your project.

If you need further assistance, please provide more details about your setup and the specific context in which the error occurs.
