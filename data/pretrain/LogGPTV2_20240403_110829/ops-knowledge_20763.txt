User: Please explain what is a distributed storage system and how to achieve data distribution, replication and fault tolerance?
Assistant: distributed storage system is a storage system that uses multiple computers to work together to store data in different computer nodes to achieve high data availability and data backup. Realize the distribution of data: In order to avoid single point of failure, the distributed storage system disperses and stores data on different computer nodes, and maps the data to different storage nodes according to the key-value hash algorithm of the data. Each node only stores a part of the data, not all, so that large-scale data storage and access can be realized. Realize data replication: In a distributed storage system, data replication is to achieve high availability of data. Generally, master-slave replication is adopted, that is, the data of the master node is synchronized to the slave node, and the master and slave nodes jointly provide services for the data. When the master node fails, the slave node can automatically take over the work of the master node. Realize data fault tolerance: In order to ensure high data reliability, the distributed storage system adopts a variety of fault tolerance mechanisms, such as data redundancy backup, fault self-recovery, data verification, etc. Redundant nodes are introduced into the system. When a node fails, the redundant nodes can automatically redistribute data and quickly restore the normal operation of the storage system. In the process of data transmission, the data verification mechanism is adopted to ensure the integrity of the data and avoid data transmission errors.
