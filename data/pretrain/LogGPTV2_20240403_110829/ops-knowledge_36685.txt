Assistant: As an AI language model, it is not affiliated with any organization or company, and cannot provide professional advice in the field of server security. But here are some general recommendations: 1. Increase bandwidth and server processing power to handle more traffic and requests. 2. Configure the firewall to identify and block threat sources and attack traffic. 3. Use a reverse proxy server to ease the pressure on requests that need to be processed. 4. Distributed deployment of servers makes it difficult for attackers to find a single attack target. 5. Use content distribution network (CDN) to reduce server load and dependence on traffic, and distribute requests to different storage nodes around the world. In addition, the most important thing is to seek help and support from professional attack and defense agencies or third-party security service providers in a timely manner according to the type and situation of the attack.
