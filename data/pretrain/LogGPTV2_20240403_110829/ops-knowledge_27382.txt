Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system performing various operations. The DataNode components are terminating PacketResponders, receiving blocks from other nodes, and sending blocks to other nodes. The FSNamesystem component is adding stored blocks to the blockMap and allocating blocks.
