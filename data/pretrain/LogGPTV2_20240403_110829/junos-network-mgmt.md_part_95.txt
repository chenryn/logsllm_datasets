Understanding Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Multiple Destinations Using Next-Hop
Groups
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can mirror traffic to multiple destinations by
configuring next-hop groups in Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters applied to tunnel interfaces. The
mirroring of packets to multiple destinations is also known as multipacket port mirroring,
NOTE: Junos OS Release 9.5 introduced support for Layer 2 port mirroring using next-hop
groups on MX Series routers, but required installation of a Tunnel PIC. Beginning in Junos OS
Release 9.6, Layer 2 port mirroring using next-hop groups on MX Series routers does not require
Tunnel PICs.
On MX Series routers and on EX Series switches, you can define a firewall filter for mirroring packets to
a next-hop group. The next-hop group can contain Layer 2 members, Layer 3 members, and subgroups
1186
that are either unit list (mirroring packets to each interface) or load-balanced (mirroring packets to one of
several interfaces). The MX Series router and the EX Series switch supports up to 30 next-hop groups.
Each next-hop group supports up to 16 next-hop addresses. Each next-hop group must specify at least
two addresses.
To enable port mirroring to the members of a next-hop group, you specify the next-hop group as the
filter action of a firewall filter, and then you apply the firewall filter to logical tunnel interfaces (lt-) or
virtual tunnel interfaces (vt-) on the MX Series router or on the EX Series switch.
NOTE: The use of subgroups for load-balancing mirrored traffic is not supported.
Defining a Next-Hop Group on MX Series Routers for Port Mirroring
Starting with release 14.2, on routers containing an Internet Processor II application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) or T Series Internet Processor, you can send a copy of an IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6
(IPv6) packet from the router to an external host address or a packet analyzer for analysis. This is known
as port mirroring.
Port mirroring is different from traffic sampling. In traffic sampling, a sampling key based on the IPv4
header is sent to the Routing Engine. There, the key can be placed in a file, or cflowd packets based on
the key can be sent to a cflowd server. In port mirroring, the entire packet is copied and sent out
through a next-hop interface.
You can configure simultaneous use of sampling and port mirroring, and set an independent sampling
rate and run-length for port-mirrored packets. However, if a packet is selected for both sampling and
port mirroring, only one action can be performed, and port mirroring takes precedence. For example, if
you configure an interface to sample every packet input to the interface and a filter also selects the
packet to be port mirrored to another interface, only the port mirroring takes effect. All other packets
not matching the explicit filter port-mirroring criteria continue to be sampled when forwarded to their
final destination.
Next-hop groups allow you to include port mirroring on multiple interfaces.
On MX Series routers, you can mirror tunnel interface input traffic to multiple destinations. To this form
of multipacket port mirroring, you specify two or more destinations in a next-hop group, define a
firewall filter that references the next-hop group as the filter action, and then apply the filter to a logical
tunnel interface lt-) or virtual tunnel interfaces (vt- on the MX Series router.
To define a next-hop group for a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter action:
1187
1. Enable the configuration of forwarding options.
[edit]
user@host set forwarding-options port-mirroring family (inet | inet6) output
2. Enable configuration of a next-hop-group for Layer 2 port mirroring.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring ... family (inet | inet6) output]
user@host# set next-hop-group next-hop-group-name
3. Specify the type of addresses to be used in the next-hop group configuration.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring ... family (inet | inet6) output next-hop-group next-
hop-group-name]
user@host# set group-type inet6
4. Specify the interfaces of the next-hop route.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring ... family (inet | inet6) output next-hop-group next-
hop-group-name]
user@host# set interface logical-interface-name-1
user@host# set interface logical-interface-name-2
or
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring ... family (inet | inet6) output next-hop-group next-
hop-group-name]
user@host# set interface interface-name next-hop next-hop-address
The MX Series router supports up to 30 next-hop groups. Each next-hop group supports up to 16
next-hop addresses. Each next-hop group must specify at least two addresses. The next-hop-address
can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
5. (Optional) Specify the next-hop subgroup.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring ... family (inet | inet6) output next-hop-group next-
hop-group-name]
user@host# set next-hop-subgroup subgroup-name interface interface-name next-hop next-hop-
address
1188
6. Verify the configuration of the next-hop group.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring ... family (inet | inet6) output next-hop-group next-
hop-group-name]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show forwarding-options
...
next-hop-group next-hop-group-name {
group-type inet6;
interface logical-interface-name-1;
interface interface-name{
next-hop next-hop-address;
}
next-hop-subgroup subgroup-name{
interface interface-name{
next-hop next-hop-address;
}
}
}
...
Example: Configuring Multiple Port Mirroring with Next-Hop Groups on M, MX and T
Series Routers
When you need to analyze traffic containing more than one packet type, or you wish to perform
multiple types of analysis on a single type of traffic, you can implement multiple port mirroring and next-
hop groups. You can make up to 16 copies of traffic per group and send the traffic to next-hop group
members. A maximum of 30 groups can be configured on a router at any given time. The port-mirrored
traffic can be sent to any interface, except aggregated SONET/SDH, aggregated Ethernet, loopback
(lo0), or administrative (fxp0) interfaces. To send port-mirrored traffic to multiple flow servers or packet
analyzers, you can use the next-hop-group statement at the [edit forwarding-options] hierarchy level.

Figure 43: Active Flow Monitoring—Multiple Port Mirroring with Next-Hop Groups Topology Diagram
Figure 43 on page 1189 shows an example of how to configure multiple port mirroring with next-hop
groups. All traffic enters the monitoring router at interface ge-1/0/0. A firewall filter counts and port-
mirrors all incoming packets to a Tunnel Services PIC. A second filter is applied to the tunnel interface
and splits the traffic into three categories: HTTP traffic, FTP traffic, and all other traffic. The three types
of traffic are assigned to three separate next-hop groups. Each next-hop group contains a unique pair of
exit interfaces that lead to different groups of packet analyzers and flow servers.
1190
NOTE: Instances enabled to mirror packets to different destinations from the same PFE, also use
different sampling parameters for each instance. When we configure Layer2 Port-mirroring with
both global port-mirroring and instance based port-mirroring, PIC level instances will override
FPC level and the FPC level will override the Global instance.

Example: Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Multiple Destinations
On MX Series routers, you can mirror traffic to multiple destinations by configuring next-hop groups in
Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters applied to tunnel interfaces.
1. Configure the chassis to support tunnel services at PIC 0 on FPC 2. This configuration includes two
logical tunnel interfaces on FPC 2, PIC 0, port 10.
[edit]
chassis {
fpc 2 {
pic 0 {
tunnel-services {
bandwidth 1g;
}
}
}
}
2. Configure the physical and logical interfaces for three bridge domains and one Layer 2 VPN CCC:
• Bridge domain bd will span logical interfaces ge-2/0/1.0 and ge-2/0/1.1.
• Bridge domain bd_next_hop_group will span logical interfaces ge-2/2/9.0 and ge-2/0/2.0.
• Bridge domain bd_port_mirror will use the logical tunnel interface lt-2/0/10.2.
1194
• Layer 2 VPN CCC if_switch will connect logical interfaces ge-2/0/1.2 and lt-2/0/10.1.
[edit]
interfaces {
ge-2/0/1 {
flexible-vlan-tagging;
encapsulation flexible-ethernet-services;
unit 0 { # An interface on bridge domain ’bd’.
encapsulation vlan-bridge;

family bridge {
filter {
input pm_bridge;
}
}
}
unit 1 { # An interface on bridge domain ’bd’.
encapsulation vlan-bridge;
vlan-id 201;
family bridge {
filter {
input pm_bridge;
}
}
}
unit 2 {
encapsulation vlan-ccc;
vlan-id 1000;
}
}
ge-2/0/2 { # For ’bd_next_hop_group’
encapsulation ethernet-bridge;
unit 0 {
family bridge;
}
}
lt-2/0/10 {
unit 1 {
encapsulation ethernet-ccc;
peer-unit 2;
}
unit 2 {
1195
encapsulation ethernet-bridge;
peer-unit 1;
family bridge {
filter {
output redirect_to_nhg;
}
}
}
}
ge-2/2/9 {
encapsulation ethernet-bridge;
unit 0 { # For ’bd_next_hop_group’
family bridge;
}
}
}
3. Configure the three bridge domains and the Layer 2 VPN switching CCC:
• Bridge domain bd spans logical interfaces ge-2/0/1.0 and ge-2/0/1.1.
• Bridge domain bd_next_hop_group spans logical interfaces ge-2/2/9.0 and ge-2/0/2.0.
• Bridge domain bd_port_mirror uses the logical tunnel interface lt-2/0/10.2.
• Layer 2 VPN CCC if_switch connects interfaces ge-2/0/1.2 and lt-2/0/10.1.
