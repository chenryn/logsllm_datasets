**User:**
I come from a Java background, where I'm accustomed to using multiple properties files that I can switch between at runtime depending on the environment (e.g., development or production). Is there a similar method in Python, particularly when using Google's App Engine framework? Currently, I have these configurations defined in `.py` files, but I would prefer a better separation.

**Assistant:**
In Google App Engine, you can achieve configuration management similar to what you're used to in Java. Here are some methods you can use to manage your configuration settings:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - You can use environment variables to store different configurations for different environments. This is a common practice in many cloud platforms.
   - In your `app.yaml` file, you can define environment variables for different services or versions:
     ```yaml
     env_variables:
       ENVIRONMENT: 'production'
       DATABASE_URL: 'your_production_db_url'
     ```

2. **Configuration Files:**
   - You can use external configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) and load them based on the environment. For example, you can have `config_dev.json` and `config_prod.json` and load the appropriate one at runtime.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import os
     import json

     def load_config():
         environment = os.getenv('ENVIRONMENT', 'development')
         config_file = f'config_{environment}.json'
         with open(config_file, 'r') as f:
             return json.load(f)

     config = load_config()
     ```

3. **Datastore:**
   - If you need more dynamic configuration, you can store configuration settings in the Datastore and retrieve them at runtime.
   - You can create a model for configuration and query it based on the environment.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import datastore

     client = datastore.Client()
     key = client.key('Config', 'production')
     entity = client.get(key)
     config = entity['settings']
     ```

4. **Cloud Storage:**
   - You can also store configuration files in Google Cloud Storage and read them at runtime.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from google.cloud import storage

     def load_config_from_storage(bucket_name, blob_name):
         storage_client = storage.Client()
         bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
         blob = bucket.blob(blob_name)
         return json.loads(blob.download_as_text())

     config = load_config_from_storage('your-bucket', 'config_prod.json')
     ```

By using one or a combination of these methods, you can achieve a clean separation of configuration and code, similar to what you are used to in Java.
