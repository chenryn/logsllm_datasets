User: Coming from a java background I'm used to having a bunch of properties files I can swap round at runtime dependent on what server I'm running on e.g. dev/production.
Is there a method in python to do similar, specifically on Google's App Engine framework?
At the minute I have them defined in .py files, obviously I'd like a better separation.
Assistant: You can:

edit records in the datastore through the dashboard ( if you really have to )
upload new scripts / files  ( you can access files in READ-ONLY )
export a WEB Service API to configuration records in the datastore ( probably not what you had in mind )
access a page somewhere through an HTTP end-point
