User: What is "load balancing"? In a large system, why is load balancing needed?
Assistant: Load balancing refers to the allocation of input traffic, network traffic, and network data to multiple servers or server clusters to achieve balanced allocation and maximum utilization of system resources. Load balancing is a technology that integrates multiple server resources into one virtual resource to improve system reliability, performance and scalability. The reasons why load balancing is needed in large-scale systems are as follows: 1. Improve system performance: When the system load exceeds the capacity of a single server, load balancing can distribute traffic and requests to multiple servers, thereby improving system performance. 2. Achieve high availability: Load balancing can distribute requests to multiple servers. Once a server fails, requests can be automatically transferred to other servers, thus ensuring high availability of the system. 3. Support system scalability: When the processing capacity of the system needs to be expanded, load balancing can be achieved by adding servers, and the system can be expanded smoothly without system crash due to the performance bottleneck of a single server.
