User: I was planning to develop an ecommerce site using Google App Engine in Python. Now, I want to use Ajax for some added dynamic features. However, I read somewhere that I need to know PHP in order to use AJAX on my website. So, is there no way I can use Ajax in Python in Google App Engine? Also, I would be using the webapp2 framework for my application.
Also, if its possible to use Ajax in Google App Engine with Python, can anyone suggest some good tutorials for learning Ajax for the same?
Assistant: AJAX has nothing to do with PHP: it's a fancy name for a technique whose goal is to provide a way for the browser to communicate asynchronously with an HTTP server. It is independent of whatever is powering that server (be it PHP, Python or anything).
I fear that you might not be able to understand this yet, so I recommend you to Google about it and experiment a lot before starting your project.
