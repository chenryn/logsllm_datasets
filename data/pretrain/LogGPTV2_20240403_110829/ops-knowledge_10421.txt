User: How to configure network interface on Linux system? Please provide detailed steps and explain what each step does.
Assistant: On the Linux system, the following steps need to be completed to configure the network interface: Step 1: Check the available network interfaces Enter the command in the terminal: `ifconfig -a`, you can view all the network interfaces on the computer. Among them, `lo` represents the local loopback interface (localhost), and the others are network card interfaces. Step 2: Configure static IP address If you need to configure a static IP address, you can execute the following command: ``` sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces ``` After entering the configuration file, add the following content at the end of the file: ``` auto eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 ``` Among them, `eth0` is the name of the network card (can be viewed in `ifconfig -a`), `address ` is the static IP address, `netmask` is the subnet mask address, `gateway` is the gateway address, and `dns-nameservers` is the DNS server address. Step 3: Restart the network service After the modification is completed, enter the following command to restart the network service: ``` sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart ``` Next, use the `ifconfig` command to check whether the configuration of the network interface is effective. Step 4: Configure DHCP to obtain an IP address If you need to use DHCP to obtain an IP address, you can execute the following command: ``` sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces ``` Add the following configuration at the end of the file: ``` auto eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp ``` Then, restart the network service: ``` sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart ``` The functions of the above steps are: Step 1: Check the available network interfaces. Step 2: Configure a static IP address. Configuring the IP address is to allow the computer to access other devices or servers through the network, and the static IP address is to ensure that the IP address obtained each time remains unchanged, which is convenient for management and maintenance. Step 3: Restart the network service. Restarting the network service is for the new configuration to take effect. Step 4: Configure DHCP to obtain an IP address. The role of DHCP is to dynamically allocate IP addresses, which is convenient for management and maintenance.
