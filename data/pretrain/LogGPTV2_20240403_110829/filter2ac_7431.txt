**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Domain Hijacking

Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains to use them in their targeting operations. Domain registration hijacking involves unauthorized changes to the domain name registration, often without the original registrant's consent. To achieve this, adversaries might:

- Gain unauthorized access to the email account of the individual listed as the domain owner. Once they have control over the email, they can initiate a password reset process to take over the domain registration.
- Use social engineering tactics to deceive domain registration support staff, thereby gaining access to the domain account.
- Exploit vulnerabilities in the domain renewal process, which may allow them to transfer or re-register the domain under their control.

These methods enable adversaries to redirect traffic, host malicious content, or impersonate legitimate entities, posing significant risks to both individuals and organizations.
