Question: Imagine you are designing a secure boot process for a System-on-Chip (SoC). Your goal is to ensure that the measurement data used for attestation is not alterable by an adversary. Which of the following design principles should be implemented to prevent an adversary from modifying the boot measurement data?
"A": "Store the measurement data in registers that are read-only with respect to an adversary.",
"B": "Implement a mechanism that allows the hash to be extended or modified by trusted agents, as proxies, if necessary.",
"C": "Employ a secure one-way hash function for calculating the measurement data and ensure the final hash value can be verified by an external entity.",
"D": "Incorporate appropriate access controls or protections for the registers that store the measurement data."
Answer: ACD
