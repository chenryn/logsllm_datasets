User: Please provide a high-availability Nginx reverse proxy solution, which needs to support load balancing, health check and other functions.
Assistant: The following is a high-availability Nginx reverse proxy solution: 1. Build multiple Nginx node servers to serve as reverse proxy controllers and application servers respectively. 2. The Nginx controller server is responsible for receiving client requests and distributing requests to multiple application servers through a load balancing algorithm. 3. Configure a health check module on the Nginx controller server to monitor the status of each application server. When a failure or abnormality of an application server is detected, the Nginx controller server will automatically remove the server and redistribute client requests to other normal application servers. 4. Configure the health check module on each application server, and periodically send heartbeat packets to the Nginx controller server. When the Nginx controller server does not receive a heartbeat packet from an application server for a long time, it will automatically remove the server. 5. In order to improve reliability, it is recommended to use multiple Nginx controller nodes to build a high-availability cluster. In the cluster, each node communicates through heartbeat packets, and the master control node is automatically elected. Through this solution, load balancing and health checks on application servers can be implemented to ensure high availability and stability of services. At the same time, by building a high-availability cluster of Nginx controller servers, the fault tolerance and reliability of the system can be improved.
