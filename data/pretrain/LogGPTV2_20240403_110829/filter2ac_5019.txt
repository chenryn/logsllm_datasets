titleblackhat:us-22 Breaking the Chrome Sandbox with Mojo
If you manage to exploit a Chrome renderer vulnerability, you find yourself in a tight sandbox. Access to OS resources like the file system are greatly restricted and site isolation still enforces the web security guarantees. To allow such strong restrictions, various IPC services provide required functionality to the renderer process which themselves can become a target for sandbox escapes.In this talk, we will take a look at Mojo, the IPC framework in Chrome. I will explain the protocol's inner workings using three logic bugs as examples. Finally, we're going to write a reliable exploit for a seemingly impossible race condition.
