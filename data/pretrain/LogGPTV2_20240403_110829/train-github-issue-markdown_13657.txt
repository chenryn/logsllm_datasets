When moving a window, if you switch desktop using Ctrl+Win+LeftArrow or
Ctrl+Win+RightArrow (or an assigned keystroke / mouse button) then the window
will follow you to that desktop, this is a feature in macOS which I think is a
useful productivity tool. It is useful for swiftly moving windows around
desktops.
