coherent receiver design.
The symbol
length (Tsym) depends on the modulation
scheme, the number of pulses in symbol, and the PRF. The
motivation of different PRF stems from the fact that the device
operates in different environments with widely varying delay
spread. The 802.15.4a device should support mandatory low
(3.9 MHz) and high PRF (15.6 MHz) and can adapt PRF based
on the channel condition. 802.15.4f supports only low-PRF (1-
2 MHz) which reduces location ambiguity and improves the
performance of the non-coherent receiver in the high multipath
environment. The security of the UWB ranging is recently
being discussed as the part of the 802.15.4z standard [2].
The 802.15.4z propose enhanced high rate pulse (HRP) and
low rate pulse (LRP) as the physical layers. The details of
the modulation schemes are yet under discussion.1 We will
see further in Section IV that the choice of the modulation
scheme, PRF, and receiver design have a direct effect on the
performance and security of the system.
D. Physical-Layer Attacks on UWB systems
IR-UWB ranging systems rely on signal time-of-ﬂight for
distance measurement. ToF ranging systems are inherently
secure against relay attacks. A relay serves the attacker to
extend the communication range, which increases the time of
ﬂight. Another attack type introduced, the Cicada attack, can
be prevented by the receiver limiting the search window. The
only remaining threat to be addressed is the ED/LC attack,
especially at increasing symbol lengths. The feasability of
ED/LC attacks is shown in [13], [12], [28]. In [12], Clulow
et al. conclude that a system relying on longer symbols is
inherently vulnerable to ED/LC attacks,
the only way to
prevent ED/LC attack is by using a short symbol length.
In [32], Tippenhauer et. al. designed a system to process short
symbols. To minimize symbol length, they allocate energy

802.15.4a as underlying schemes.

within a time frame as short as feasible. This leaves little
room to an attacker to shorten the time measured. Existing
proposals against ED/LC attack provide the choice between
longer symbols (longer distance) or security.
A short symbol given by a single narrow pulse (1-2ns) can
be considered secure against an ED/LC attack and is, therefore,
a good basis for secure ranging. This suggests that the base
mode of IEEE 802.15.4f be secure against ED/LC attacks.
The extended and long-range modes of 802.15.4f rely on more
pulses per bit. Unfortunately, due to long symbol lengths and
predictable symbol structures, these modes are vulnerable to
ED/LC attacks. The problems in IEEE 802.15.4a seem more
fundamental and will be discussed in Section VIII.
E. Formalization
In [22], the authors formally deﬁne Message Time of Arrival
Codes (MTACs), addressing the security requirements for
the prevention of distance reduction and enlargement attacks.
UWB-PR, as introduced in this work, is an example of an
MTAC that prevents a distance reduction attack. This claim is
in line with the results of the security analysis in Section VI.
III. THREAT MODEL
We focus on a scenario where two mutually trusted nodes
are interested in measuring the distance between them. The
nodes perform ToF measurements, relying on UWB signals
for precise time resolution. These nodes have a shared secret
and are assumed to have access to commonly-used encryption
standards and protocols to attain conﬁdentiality. They can
secretly share logical-layer data and other information required
for secure ranging.
The attacker’s objective is to reduce the perceived distance
between these nodes. She can have different incentives to
perform such a distance-reduction attack, such as opening
a car, gaining access to an ofﬁce, or stealing money from
a credit card, etc. We consider that the attacker has access
to sophisticated hardware and processing capabilities. She
can eavesdrop on messages transmitted by honest nodes,
and get

malicious node can synchronize her transmission to ongoing
transmissions and can adapt the transmission power of the
signal. However, we assume a malicious node not to have
access to any secret information and not being able to steal
the identity of honest nodes. The attacker controls the commu-
nication channel, and she can prevent all direct communication
between the honest nodes or eavesdrop on the data they are
transmitting, but she will receive encrypted data. The attacker’s
inability to predict this secret information prevents her from
performing a reduction attack at the logical layer. However, the
use of sophisticated hardware and processing power allows her
to perform an ED/LC attack at the physical layer.
The problem of ED/LC attack arises due to predictable
symbols and is ampliﬁed by long symbols. To address this
problem, we ﬁrst establish that longer symbols cannot be
avoided, and then look at the possibility of designing a secure
physical layer. We propose UWB-PR - a secure modulation
scheme to prevent ED/LC attacks. We look at possible attacks
on UWB-PR, involving an attacker that detects pulses from
honest transmitters and reacts accordingly.
IV. DESIGN SPACE
A. Single-Pulse vs. Multi-Pulse Systems
Because UWB systems operate over wide segments of
licensed spectrum, they have to be compliant with stringent
regulatory constraints. Firstly, the power spectral density can-
not exceed −41.3dBm/MHz, averaged over a time interval of
1ms. Secondly, the power measured in a 50MHz-bandwidth
around the peak frequency is limited to 0dBm.
Long symbols are associated with unfavorable outcomes in
ED/LC attacks. Therefore, a reasonable assumption might be
that a system aiming primarily for security and long distance
will ﬁrst try to maximize the power per pulse and then the
pulse repetition frequency (PRF), in order to guarantee highest
possible energy per symbol while keeping the symbol as short
as possible. Optimally, such a system would hence exactly
meet both constraints. Maxing out the average constraint can
only be done for certain PRFs, however. Speciﬁcally, all PRFs
below 187.5 kHz are less than optimal due to the power per
pulse saturating under the peak power constraint [14].
Consequently, a single pulse per bit sent at a PRF of
187.5kHz could theoretically be considered optimal in terms
of security and performance. In practice, there exist legitimate
incentives for higher PRFs and also increased numbers of
pulses per bit, however. Data rates exceeding 187.5kbps can
only be offered at higher PRFs since the bit rate cannot
exceed the pulse rate in the burst position modulation (BPM)
or on-off keying (OOK), which are the modulations used by
802.15.4a and 802.15.4f. Moreover, the instantaneous power
can be a serious limitation imposed by the hardware, especially
at high integration densities. Likely to accommodate for the
latter, 802.15.4a, for instance, offers a range of different
conﬁgurations, each with similar energy per symbol, but
varying PRFs and energy levels per pulse. This underscores
Fig. 5. Two independent causes are driving the need for more pulses
per symbol: Low instantaneous power and high performance in terms of
energy per symbol, both under compliance with regulatory constraints. The
higher energy per symbol
is needed for the longer distance and NLoS
measurements. However, longer and deterministic symbol structure make the
system vulnerable to ED/LC attack.
the practical necessity of spreading out energy across pulses,
even if regulations might not require it.
Given a certain PRF, increased performance and distance
can always be achieved by increasing the symbol length. This
fact gets reﬂected well in the extended mode of 802.15.4f,
where a symbol consists of four pulses as compared to only
one pulse in the base mode. However, the PRF remains un-
changed (and, in particular, uniform).2 As a consequence, this
approach allows to achieve virtually arbitrary symbol energy,
without violating regulatory and other power constraints, by
constructing ever longer symbols.3 However, without securing
the modulation, what essentially constitutes repetition coding
is still highly vulnerable to ED/LC attacks. This is the problem
addressed in UWB-PR.
We conclude that a) irrespective of the PRF, longer symbols
and more pulses per symbols reliably provide higher distances
and b) maxing out pulse power according to regulations might
not be viable due to hardware constraints. This means that, for
meaningful distances, a practical, highly integrated system will
likely use multi-pulse symbols (and therefore be vulnerable to
ED/LC attacks on the symbol level). These considerations are
summarized in Figure 5.
B. Physical-Layer Cryptographic Operations
Multi-pulse UWB systems need to be secured against
physical-layer attacks on ToF measurement by means of
dedicated, physical-layer cryptographic operations. Encrypting
the data bits exchanged as part of distance-bounding protocols
is not sufﬁcient. An ED/LC attacker can exploit redundant,
multi-pulse signal structures despite knowing nothing about
the data being exchanged.
On the other hand, individual UWB pulses are too short for
a meaningful ED/LC attack, as the theoretically achievable
reduction would be less than 1m. Therefore, the focus of

the timing of subsequent secret information.
Since a successful ED/LC attack is based on the attacker
knowing the shape of the symbol as well as when the symbol
starts and ends, pulse reordering prevents this attack by
blinding the pulse polarity, through XOR with a preshared
sequence, and by reordering pulses such that the attacker does
not know which pulse belongs to which bit (i.e., where each
bit starts/ends).
In ED/LC,
the attacker implicitly relies on determinis-
tic mappings between symbol positions and bits. In both
802.15.4a and 802.15.4f, this assumption is justiﬁed, since
symbols consist of consecutive UWB pulses. UWB-PR intro-
duces uncertainty for an ED/LC attacker in both assessing past
symbols and deciding when to interfere in the future (in order
to affect a certain bit). While ED/LC attacks require an attacker
being able to effectively decouple timing from cryptographic
uncertainty, the reordering of UWB-PR cryptographically cou-
ples the random bits and pulse timings. As a consequence, an
attacker has to guess correctly both the symbol values and
symbol timings in order to guess a bit and is uncertain about
the progress of the attack at any time.
a) Distance Measurement with UWB-PR: While UWB-
PR secures the payload of each transmission, the structure
of the preamble at the beginning of each bit sequence is
no secret. The receiver relies on this preamble for time
synchronization. In the context of distance bounding,
the
timing of the preamble equated to a distance commitment
as introduced in [32] and illustrated in Figure 7. While an
attacker can trivially send the preamble early in an attempt to
reduce the distance, he still has to guess subsequent protected
symbols to be successful. The preamble does not contain any
information about the nonces nV E and nP R. The timing of the
preamble simply tells the receiver when to expect this secret
information. Correct detection and veriﬁcation then depend
on this time offset being consistent with the actual timing of
the UWB-PR pulses constituting nV E and nP R. The timing
of the preamble is therefore binding. If the preamble is sent
early, each subsequent pulse will be expected earlier by the
receiver, essentially forcing an attacker to guess each pulse
for successful veriﬁcation. If the preamble alone is sent early,
the receiver will detect the inconsistency in the timing of
the preamble and the secret payload or might not be able to
recover the data at all, dismissing the claim in both cases.

secutive bits and cryptographically blinds their polarities before transmission.
UWB-PR employs OOK, however, for visualization purposes, off-slots are
shown as pulses with negative polarity.
cryptographic operations is to make it
impossible for an
attacker to exploit the redundant encoding of information bits
in multiple consecutive pulses. This is equivalent to hiding
the way a receiver generates information bits from a train
of UWB pulses. Physical-layer cryptographic operations are
not related to the data transmitted on the logical-level (i.e.,
the bits). In the same sense that bit-level cryptography does
not protect against physical-layer ED/LC attack, bit-level data
is not affected by the speciﬁc secrets used for physical-
layer encryption. These operations, therefore, add an additional
layer of security, speciﬁcally to protect against those attacks.
Physical-layer cryptographic operations randomize the pulse
sequence, given some bit-sequence to be transmitted.
Irrespective of how the information is encoded in the pulses
(OOK, FSK, PSK), we can model each pulse as having two po-
larities. We argue that physical-layer cryptographic operations
can be concerned with a) XORing the pulse polarities with a
random sequence4 and b) hiding the timing of pulses belonging
to a given bit. UWB-PR relies on the ﬁrst and employs the
latter mechanism by reordering5 the pulses of consecutive bits.
V. UWB WITH PULSE REORDERING
UWB-PR is a new modulation technique that enhances the
extended mode of 802.15.4f with cryptographic operations at
pulse level to prevent all physical-layer attacks on ranging,
including ED/LC, while retaining the range and performance
of the extended mode. To the best of our knowledge, UWB-PR
is the ﬁrst modulation to prevent ED/LC attacks independently
of communication range offered.
The main intuition behind UWB-PR is provided in Fig-
ure 6 and can be summarised as follows. UWB-PR randomly
reorders the UWB pulses that are associated with each bit
and cryptographically blinds their polarity before transmission.

Previous considerations make an OOK modulation as used
in 802.15.4f a reasonable choice for our system. In the follow-
ing, we introduce the major steps involved in transmission and
reception of a bit sequence with UWB-PR. This involves the
encoding, which accommodates our main security features,
as well as the continuous time signal representation and
subsequent decoding.
a) Pulse Reordering: As part of the encoding, we intro-
duce a reordering of pulses that interleaves symbols of multiple
consecutive bits. Consider ﬁrst a deterministic encoding with
NP UWB pulses per bit. The reordering function R reorders
the pulses of NB consecutive bits as deﬁned by a permutation
π. π speciﬁes the mapping between pulse positions before and
after reordering. Π denotes the set of all possible reorderings.
There are |Π| = (NP·NB)!/(NP )NB ways to assign the pulses
to bits, all equally probable from the attacker’s point of view.
We design the system to choose a fresh, random reordering
π ∈ Π for each frame. This secret is assumed to be shared
between veriﬁer and prover before the ranging phase. The
reordering function subject to some permutation is deﬁned as
R(P, π) = (pπ(0), ..., pπ(NP ·NB−1)).
The reordered pulse sequence can in general be deﬁned as
ˆP = R(P, π), π U AR← Π.
The choice of π being a secret shared by transmitter and
receiver, an attacker has no knowledge that allows to link
pulse positions to bits. From an attacker’s point of view all
|Π| reorderings are equally probable.
b) Pulse Blinding: In addition to randomizing the pulse
positions, we suggest to XOR the resulting sequence with a
random bitmask M. We deﬁne the UWB-PR pulse sequence
as the XOR of the reordered pulse sequence and a random
bitmask:
˜P = ˆP ⊕ M, M U AR← M
The idea behind this is to guarantee high entropy in the
resulting pulse sequence, irrespective of the choice of codes
and bit sequences nV E or nP R at higher protocol layers.
Again, we assume that M is chosen randomly for each
exchange and shared between prover and veriﬁer before the
ranging phase.
c) Modulation: In OOK, a binary sequence is encoded
as a pulse either being present or absent at a known time.
We consider regularly spaced pulse positions with period
