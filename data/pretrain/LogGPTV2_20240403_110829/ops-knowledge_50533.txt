User: I'm on a bluehost-server which has a "rudimental" installation of python2.6.
I installed python2.6 in my user-directory which works fine so far, but when I try to install python packages with "setup.py install", "easy_install" or "pip install" I get:
error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.6/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)
So, it tries to use the system-wide installation which does not have this Makefile. Also using the --prefix or --user argument doesn't help.
How can I tell pip or easy_install to use the python-installation in my user-directory?
Assistant: You need to execute setup.py by specifying which python interpreter on the command line, like this:
/path/to/python setup.py install

UPDATE:
The error message indicates that you don't have the python-dev package 
installed on your system.
