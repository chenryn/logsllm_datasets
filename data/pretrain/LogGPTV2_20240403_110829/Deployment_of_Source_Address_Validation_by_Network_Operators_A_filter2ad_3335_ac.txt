separately from the rest of the world. Then in both branches,
we randomly assigned each operator to a treatment or control
group. We had ﬁve treatment groups and one control group
for the Brazilian sample, and seven treatment groups and one

control group outside of Brazil. The treatments are the same,
except for the CERT group, which outside of Brazil includes
two additional treatments for the social nudges. In total, we
apply eight different treatments.
We had to modify the assignment process since CERT and
NOG treatments operate at country-level: instead of assigning
the operator contacts, we assign a country to a treatment
group. The process becomes complicated since we want to
have a balanced population across treatments, and the number
of operators in each country is not the same. We designed our
solution based on a best-effort algorithm to distribute contacts
among different groups. We run the algorithm separately for
contacts in Brazil and contacts in other countries. In each
assignment, our random algorithm ﬁrst validates if it can
assign the contact to the treatment group. This is not always
the case for the CERT and NOG treatments. For a few
countries we have no contact point for a national CERT or
for a NOG mailing list. If, for a speciﬁc operator, we have
no CERT or NOG mailing list in our data set, the algorithm
randomly selects another operator.
Under some conditions, the randomization could lead to
unbalanced assignments. Stratiﬁcation would then be used to
ensure balanced treatment groups. However, methodological
studies [58] have shown that in moderate and large sam-
ples, like ours, random assignment and stratiﬁcation achieve
similar variances. Furthermore, we checked various network
and economic factors after the assignment to determine if
the groups were in fact balanced. We statistically tested the
group differences using ANOVA for: average AS size (i.e.,
number of IPv4 addresses calculated using longest matching
preﬁxes in BGP announcement per AS), number of misconﬁg-
ured forwarders, number of countries, number of stub ASes,
membership of MANRS, Gross Domestic Product, and ICT
Development Index assigned to each group. We found no
statistical difference between the groups, which means they
were similar for these variables.
4) Preventing Treatment Spillover: We designed the
study to prevent contamination between the treatments. We
built a website with an interface to the data on the non-
compliant IP addresses and ASes. It also includes a detailed
explanation of our methodology to infer the lack of SAV aided
by dynamically generated diagrams containing misconﬁgured
IP addresses and information on how to reproduce the result.
The website segments the information for different groups
and recipients and does not contain any information for the
control groups. We created separate sub-domains for CERT,
NOG, and privately communicated treatments. We then gener-
ated unique URLs for each subject in the treatment. To prevent
contamination within the private group, we sent individual
links in our notiﬁcation. The URLs only gave them access
to the misconﬁgured IP addresses mapped to their ASes.
Similarly, we drafted a message for the CERT to forward to
the ASes assigned to them. We instructed CERTs to append the
AS number at the end of the URL to create a unique link for
the operator they are contacting. Operators notiﬁed by CERT
could potentially tinker with the URL to ﬁnd information about
other operators assigned to the CERT group. However, they
cannot ﬁnd information about other treatment groups since a
different sub-domain segregates them.
The notiﬁcation to the NOG contains all the ASes and IP
addresses assigned to the notiﬁed NOG. They cannot view
operators assigned to other NOGs, since they are segregated
via unique URLs. NOG treatment was likely to be seen by
some operators in other treatments, but the NOG message had
no information on operators in those other treatments. The
website had no data on the control group.
C. Notiﬁcation Procedure
We launched our ﬁrst campaign on Oct 8, 2020 and sent
notiﬁcations to 2,563 operators, and continued to conduct
weekly scans to observe the remediation of IP spooﬁng. For
operators that did not remediate, we sent a second message
on Dec 8, 2020. We analyzed the remediation data until Feb
28, 2021. This meant that operators had about four months to
implement SAV since our ﬁrst notiﬁcation.
Of all our emails, 102 (4%) bounced. In those cases, we
retried with an alternate email address where possible, and
reached additional 30 contacts. Eventually, we removed 72
contacts which we could not reach. Around 97% of our
emails reached the recipients, which shows our approach to
prioritize peeringDB and technical contacts gave improved
reachability compared to previous studies, where in some cases
the bounce rate was over 50% [28], [29]. In most cases, we got
an automated reply that conﬁrmed they had received the email
and a ticket has been opened or someone would follow up. The
German CERT copied us in cc in the forwarded notiﬁcations
to the operators.
D. Post-Experiment Survey Design
To further understand the challenges in deploying SAV and
contextualize the interpretations of our experimental ﬁndings,
we designed a short survey aiming at collecting feedback from
the operators. The survey has four main objectives. First, to
understand the security challenges faced by network operators
and what role SAV and DDoS play among them. Second, to
understand if the notiﬁcation has reached the correct contact
person and preferable method for providers to receive similar
notiﬁcations. Third, to understand the challenges in imple-
menting SAV and whether the content of our notiﬁcations and
referenced resources were sufﬁcient for operators to deploy
SAV in their network. Finally, we wanted to solicit suggestions
on how to improve the notiﬁcation process in general. Our
survey was partially inspired by Lichtblau et al. [17], who in
2017 surveyed network operators about the impact of spooﬁng
on their network, their ﬁltering strategies, and challenges in
the adoption of SAV.
In the survey, we asked participants about four main topics:
1) what security issues they believe their networks have, and
how they discover them; 2)whether they have implemented or
have planned to implement SAV and a subsequent question on
their chosen methodology to deploy ﬁltering from operators
with SAV 3) who is responsible for implementing SAV in

their organization, and whether the issue was escalated to
the responsible entity; 4) whether MANRS guidelines provide
sufﬁcient information on how to implement SAV, what other
strategies can help achieve better compliance, and how would
network operators prefer to be notiﬁed about IP spooﬁng
issues. The full questionnaire is included in Appendix B.
As compensation for their valuable time and comments, we
offered all respondents a 50 Euro gift card through a rafﬂe
with a 1:15 chance of winning. Participants were offered an
option to stay anonymous and let us donate the prize to a
charity.
E. Ethics
We had a detailed discussion with the university’s IRB
and received clearance to conduct the notiﬁcation experiment
and the survey. Our study followed all the active monitoring
guidelines for ethical network measurement research [59],
including creating a web page running at the IP address of
the scanner, communicating with Internet response teams, and
providing an opt-out option for operators.
We conducted our own scans since there is no existing
public dataset that reveals non-compliance for SAV using our
methodology. It is important to note that our scans are different
from scans that aim to detect open resolvers, since we track re-
sponses that arrive from a different source IP address than the
probed address. This means we cannot use existing data from
open resolver scans conducted by Shadowserver and others.
We randomly distributed our queries across the IPv4 address
space, so the scanner does not consistently query the same
AS before moving on to the next one. Furthermore, in line
with the Menlo report [60], we considered that the marginal
negative impacts of these measurements are outweighed by the
beneﬁcence of improved SAV adoption and reduced spoofed
attack trafﬁc. We only received two requests to opt-out and
we immediately removed their IP ranges from the study.
Finally, we asked for consent from providers at the start of
the survey and explained to them that we will anonymize their
responses before publishing them. We offered compensation in
the form of a lottery with gift cards. If they did not want to
receive gift cards due to the nature of the job or for any other
reason, we gave them an option to donate the amount to a
charity and stay anonymous.
IV. RESULTS
In this section, we analyze the impact of our notiﬁcations on
remediation rates across different treatment groups. We start
by examining remediation at three different levels: organiza-
tion, AS, and preﬁx level. Then, we compare the remediation
rates between CERT and NOG treatments.
A. Organization-Level Remediation
We start the analysis at the organizational level. Organiza-
tions can operate multiple ASes and while the SAV compliance
can differ per AS, the decision to implement SAV can be
driven by organizational policies. Therefore, we bundled the
ASes with the same contact email address together as they

are most likely sibling ASes under the same administrative
domain. Thus our unit of analysis is contact email addresses
for the ASes. Our data set contains 200 (8.6%) contacts with
more than one AS registered in WHOIS.
We only consider remediation as successful if all ASes
under the contact email address do not appear in our scans
after we have notiﬁed them. It is a high bar to pass since
it might miss partial compliance, where providers might be
remediating some ASes in their network or just a part of their
AS.
To understand the differences across the groups, we com-
pute the Kaplan-Meier survival curves per group as shown
in Figure 3. On the y-axis, we have the probability of an
organization deploying SAV t days after they received the
notiﬁcation (x-axis). This is estimated taking into account
the number of organizations that had deployed SAV at time
t divided by the total number of organizations that had not
deployed SAV at time t. Overall, the survival curves show the
same downwards trend for all the groups including the control.
In Brazil, the NOG and Private Social groups do slightly
better: they remediated 10% and 6% more than the control
group, respectively. In the rest of the countries, networks in
the NOG group remediated 5% more than in the control group.
To check whether these differences in remediation rates are
statistically signiﬁcant, we ran the log-rank test comparing the
survival curves of the control group with the treatments. It

tests the null hypothesis H0 : S1(t) = S2(t) for all t where
the two exposures have survival functions S1(t) and S2(t). We
consider (≤ 0.05) as statistically signiﬁcant. Conﬁrming our
initial visual observations, most of the groups did not have
signiﬁcantly different remediation rates. Only the result for
the NOG group in Brazil is weakly statistically signiﬁcant
(p = 0.049). However, in light of how many treatments we
tested, a 1 in 20 probability of this outcome being due to
chance, is actually quite plausible. So we do not see this as
enough evidence of an impact of that treatment group.
For all countries except Brazil, we also observed the CERT
Social group remediated slightly slower (p = 0.043) than the
control group. To understand why the CERT Social group
remediated slower than the control group, we investigated the
distribution of organizations at the start of our analysis in Fig-
ure 2. There are 34 (17.8%) fewer contacts in the CERT Social
group than in the control. Hence, the baseline probability of
remediation is also lower. Some network operators might have
upgraded their routers or policies, which we count as baseline,
or natural, remediation. In Figure 4, we compare remediation
in the CERT Social group with other groups. We observe that
remediation for contacts in the CERT Social group is similar
to the control, NOG, and Private Social groups. Moreover, the
average remediation in the CERT Social group is around 54%,
while the average is only slightly higher for the rest of the
countries (58%). In short, we can conclude that remediation
in the CERT Social group is worse than in the control group
mainly due to sampling differences.
B. Partial Remediation
An organization can choose to implement SAV for a few
ASes but not for all the ASes they operate. Multiple ASes
could also be managed by different teams, especially if these
are located in different countries. Similarly, due to technical
reasons like ASes not being stub or multihomed networks,
operators might not be able to implement SAV in their
entire network. To further investigate this, we analyzed partial
remediation measured as the number of ASes and preﬁxes
within an organization that implemented SAV within the study
period.
AS-level remediation: Figure 5 shows the survival curves
using ASes as unit of analysis. The results are almost identical
to the organization-level results. The global remediation rates
are not signiﬁcantly different between the treatments and the
