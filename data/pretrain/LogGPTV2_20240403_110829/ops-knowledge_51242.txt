User: There is no tray in Unity under Ubuntu 11.04.
How can I make icon appear somewhere in Unity? wx.TaskBarIcon is not appear anywhere.
Thanks
Assistant: With Ubuntu Unity desktop environment (i.e. Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10), you need to "whitelist" your application.
There are different ways to do this using the 'gsettings' application from the command line.
I had to do this to get programs like Skype showing in the system tray again, not just for my own custom apps that use wxPython.
