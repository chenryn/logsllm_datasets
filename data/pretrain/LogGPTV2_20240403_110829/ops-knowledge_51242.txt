**User:** In Ubuntu 11.04 with the Unity desktop environment, there is no system tray. How can I make an icon, such as one created using `wx.TaskBarIcon`, appear in the Unity interface?

**Assistant:** In the Unity desktop environment (as seen in Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10), you need to "whitelist" your application for it to display its icon in the system tray. This can be achieved using the `gsettings` command-line tool.

Here are the steps to whitelist an application:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Use the following `gsettings` command to add your application to the whitelist:
   ```sh
   gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist "['your-application-executable-name']"
   ```
   Replace `'your-application-executable-name'` with the name of the executable file for your application. For example, if your application is named `myapp`, the command would be:
   ```sh
   gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist "['myapp']"
   ```

If you have multiple applications that need to be whitelisted, you can add them all to the list by separating them with commas, like so:
```sh
gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist "['myapp', 'skype', 'another-app']"
```

This method works not only for custom applications using `wxPython` but also for other programs like Skype, which may not show up in the system tray by default.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
