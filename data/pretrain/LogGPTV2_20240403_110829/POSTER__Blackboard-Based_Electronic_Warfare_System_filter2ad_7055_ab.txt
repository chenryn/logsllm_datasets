Figure 1. Logical diagram of the proposed system. 
It is important to note that this logical model can be represented in 
multiple different ways in physical implementation.  The central 
virtual  blackboard  approach  intentionally  supports  operations 
across security perimeters and on untrusted (in addition to trusted) 
hardware.    The  logistics  of  the  physical  implementation  are 
discussed subsequently. 
3.1  Communications Model 
There  are  two  components  to  the  communications  logistics:  the 
data  transfer  mechanism  and  the  re-convergence  mechanism.  
Effectively,  the  Blackboard  Architecture  is  implemented  using 
non-owned/operated  data  stores  with  hypertext  transfer  protocol 
(HTTP) as the communications mechanism.  The majority of the 
elements  of  the  data  model  are  not  transferred  between  nodes.  
The  data  that  is  transferred  (except  during  new  node  creation) 
falls  into  two  categories:  boundary  object  changes  and  entity  / 
connector  /  protector  (and  associated  attribute  data)  network 
updates. 
transmission  approaches  can  be  used, 
depending on the sensitivity of the application.

3.2  System Operations 
This  section  provides  an  overview  of  the  operations  of  the 
proposed  system.    A  wide  variety  of  node  configurations  are 
the  nature  of 
possible  given 
the  system.  One  example 
configuration is shown in Figure 2. 
Fundamentally,  the  system  has  three  modes:  inert,  network 
building  and  active.    In  the  first  mode,  nodes  are  waiting  and 
regularly checking to determine if they have been triggered.  Re-
convergence activities will occur, if needed; however, no network 
expansion  or  attack  /  defense  activities  are  conducted.    The 
system  also  scans  network  traffic  to  augment  the  topology  data 
store.   
The  second  mode,  network  building,  involves  the  system 
identifying  other  prospectively  useful  entities  to  place  system 
nodes  on.    It  will  use  offensive  capabilities  to  compromise 
systems, as necessary, to place the control software; however, it 
will not conduct attacks in furtherance of goals.  Like in the inert 
mode,  the  system  is  waiting  for  activation  instructions  and  will 
engage  in  re-convergence  activities,  if  required.    It  also  scans 
network  traffic  to  expand  the  topology  data  store  with  any  new 
1682information  detected.    For  example,  in  the  system  shown  in 
Figure  2,  the  gold-colored  computers  are  system  nodes.    The 
system  would,  thus,  identify  the  need  to  compromise  and  load 
itself on to one of the grey-colored servers to have direct access to 
the target network to attack the other servers. 
In  the  third  mode,  active,  the  system  utilizes  its  offensive 
capabilities  to  achieve  the  objectives  dictated  by  its  network  of 
rules, actions and facts and the topographical information stored 
within  the  system’s  data  stores.    Continued  passive  scans  of 
network  traffic  (and,  potentially,  depending  on  obfuscation  and 
stealth  requirements,  active  probing)  is  used  to  expand  the 
topology  data  store.    The  data  store  is  also  updated  with 
information  about  changes  caused  by  system  operations 
(computers that host a control process, computers disabled, etc.). 
Once placed in active mode, the system will continue to seek to 
achieve its goals until it receives a command to return to the inert 
or network building modes.  As newly deployed system nodes are 
always  deployed  in  the  same  mode  as  their  deploying  node,  all 
nodes that it deploys will also be in active mode.  Even if cut off 
from other nodes, if a pathway towards goal attainment exists, it 
will be pursued.  Thus, if a node gets proverbially ‘trapped behind 
enemy  lines’  it  can  continue  to  operate  until  instructed  to  stand 
down to another mode, a final goal is achieved or no pathway that 
advances the system towards goal attainment can be identified. 
The exact arsenal of attack capabilities available to the system is a 
deployment-specific  consideration.    This  is  based  on  the  system 
owner’s  objectives  and  what  types  of  collateral  damage  it 
considers  acceptable.    Limitations  on  attacks  can  be  imposed 
through  both  the  tools  provided  as  well  as  the  configuration 
parameters  that  associate  particular  tools  with  particular  system 
types.    Limiting  the scope of attack takes two forms:  first, if a 
type of system is not included, it will not be attacked.  However, 
as some deployments may include generic attacks (that match any 
system) or operating system level attacks, a more specific rule can 
be employed that associates a system with a non-attack tool. 
Human operator control over the system is achieved via the same 
communications mechanism used by the system nodes.  A control 
computer (highlighted in red in Figure 2) can be located anywhere 
with  the  requisite  connectivity.    It  will  communicate  with  the 
system via the mechanisms discussed previously and perform re-
convergence as required.
