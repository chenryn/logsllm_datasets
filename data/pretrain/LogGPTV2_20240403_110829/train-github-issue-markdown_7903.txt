I'm currently building an vim extension for vscode when I encountered this
problem.  
I need to bind keys such as `i` in `Normal Mode` and unbind it in `Insert
Mode` so suggestions and other vscode's builtin features could work as normal.  
In detail, my desired package.json can be:
    {
        "contributes": {
            "keybindings": [
                {
                    "command": "vim.i",
                    "key": "i",
                    "when": "editorTextFocus && !isVimInsertMode"
                },
                // ...
            ]
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
It would be a great help if extension can access `KeybindingService` to
register context to keybindings or bind/unbind in runtime.
ps: I can mimic all the default behaviours in `Insert Mode`, but that's just a
lot of duplicate code and unnessery time.
