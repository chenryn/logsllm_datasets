Note that far from all of these formats have been tested properly, if you run into any issues please first [consult the GDAL docs](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html), or open an issue here on GitHub.  
`ST_Read` also supports limited support for predicate pushdown and spatial filtering (if the underlying GDAL driver supports it), but column pruning (projection pushdown) while technically feasible is not yet implemented.   
`ST_Read` also allows using GDAL's virtual filesystem abstractions to read data from remote sources such as S3, or from compressed archives such as zip files.   
**Note**: This functionality does not make full use of parallelism due to GDAL not being thread-safe, so you should expect this to be slower than using e.g. the DuckDB Parquet extension to read the same GeoParquet or DuckDBs native csv reader to read csv files. Once we implement support for reading more vector formats natively through this extension (e.g. GeoJSON, GeoBuf, ShapeFile) we will probably split this entire GDAL part into a separate extension.  
# Supported Functions  
🧭 - GEOS - functions that are implemented using the [GEOS](https://libgeos.org/) library  
🦆 - DuckDB - functions that are implemented natively in this extension that are capable of operating directly on the DuckDB types  
🔄 - CAST(GEOMETRY) - functions that are supported by implicitly casting to `GEOMETRY` and then using the `GEOMETRY` implementation  
We are actively working on implementing more functions, and will update this table as we go.  
Again, please feel free to open an issue if there is a particular function you would like to see implemented. Contributions are also welcome!
