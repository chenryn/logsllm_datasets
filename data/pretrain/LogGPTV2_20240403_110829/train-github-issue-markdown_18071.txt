Currently `ControllerResolver` is responsible for determining the parameters
to pass to controller actions. It does so via `Reflection` matching request
attribute names to action parameter names. For parameters using the `Request`
type hint it however knows to inject the `Request` instance.
Now in FOSRestBundle we have a need to inject parameters by type hint. Which
leads to having to do the same work again. See for example:  
FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle#745
So it might make sense to provide some way to tell the `ControllerResolver`
for whatever other type hints to look for and what attributes to map them to.
