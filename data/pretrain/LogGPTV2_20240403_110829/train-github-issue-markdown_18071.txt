Currently, the `ControllerResolver` is responsible for determining the parameters to be passed to controller actions. It achieves this by using `Reflection` to match request attribute names with action parameter names. For parameters that use the `Request` type hint, it automatically injects the `Request` instance.

In FOSRestBundle, there is a need to inject parameters based on their type hints, which currently requires duplicating similar functionality. An example of this can be found in [FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle#745](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/issues/745).

To address this, it might be beneficial to provide a mechanism for the `ControllerResolver` to recognize additional type hints and map them to the appropriate request attributes. This would allow for more flexible and reusable parameter injection, avoiding the need for redundant code.
