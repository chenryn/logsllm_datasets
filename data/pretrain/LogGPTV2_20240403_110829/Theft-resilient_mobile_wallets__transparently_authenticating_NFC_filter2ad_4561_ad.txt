APPENDIX
A. RESULTS FOR OTHER DURATIONS
In this section, we show the performance of the classiﬁers
for generalized as well as for diﬀerent scenarios using 10-Fold
cross validation for two and three seconds duration of tap
gesture. The result for two seconds duration of tap gesture is
summarized in Table 4 while that for three seconds duration
of tap gesture is summarized in Table 5. The accuracy did
not change signiﬁcantly even when longer duration than one
second of tap gesture was used to classify. Moreover, the
performance of the classiﬁer dropped in some occasions when
longer duration was used.
Table 4: The results for Generalized and Scenario-
speciﬁc models for tapping duration of two seconds.
Each column shows average (Avg) and standard de-
viation (S.D.) for F-Measure, Recall and Precision.
Precision and recall captures the security and the
usability of the system, respectively. F-measure ac-
counts for both precision and recall.
