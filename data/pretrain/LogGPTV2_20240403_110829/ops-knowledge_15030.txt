User: My app opens a TCP socket and waits for data from other users on the network using the same application. At the same time, it can broadcast data to a specified host on the network. 
Currently, I need to manually enter the IP of the destination host to be able to send data. I want to be able to find a list of all hosts running the application and have the user pick which host to broadcast data to.
Is Bonjour/ZeroConf the right route to go to accomplish this? (I'd like it to cross-platform OSX/Win/*Nix)
Assistant: Zeroconf/DNS-SD is an excellent idea in this case. It's provided by Bonjour on OS X and Windows (but must be installed separately or as part of an Apple product on Windows), and by Avahi on FOSS *nix.
