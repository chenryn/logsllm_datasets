User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Queued ingestion and data latencies:
What causes queued ingestion latency?

n
Assistant: Ingestion latency can result from the [ingestion batching policy](batching-policy.md) settings, or a data backlog buildup. To address this, adjust the [batching policy settings](batching-policy.md).
Latencies that are part of the ingestion process can be [monitored](../../monitor-queued-ingestion.md).
