User:  Please explain how to implement mutual access between servers through routing table configuration.
Assistant: The mutual access between servers needs to communicate through the network, and the routing table is one of the important tools to control network communication. When configuring the routing table to achieve mutual access between servers, you can follow the steps below: 1. Determine the network topology: First, you need to understand the physical topology of the network and the connection method of network devices in order to configure routers and switches correctly. 2. Set IP address and subnet mask: Each server needs to be assigned a unique IP address, and all servers must use the same subnet mask. These configurations can be done through network settings or DHCP service in the operating system. 3. Configure the router: The router is a key device for connecting different networks. It is necessary to set up the router correctly to achieve mutual access between servers. A router needs to be set with a gateway address in order to pass packets to other networks. 4. Add routing table: The routing table instructs how packets are sent from the source server to the destination server. Generally speaking, the routing table specifies information such as network range, gateway address, and egress port. Routing tables can be added through the command line interface or the graphical interface. 5. Test network connection: After completing the above configuration, test whether the mutual access between servers is successful. You can use the ping command or other network tools to test. Through the above steps, the routing table can be successfully configured to achieve mutual access between servers. However, routing table configurations may vary depending on network topology and device model, and need to be adjusted accordingly for specific situations.
