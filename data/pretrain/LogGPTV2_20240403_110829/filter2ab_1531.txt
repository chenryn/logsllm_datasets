**ATT&CK ID:** T1134.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SID-History Injection

Adversaries may employ SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. In the Windows operating system, a security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are utilized in both security descriptors and access tokens to manage permissions and access control.

The `SID-History` attribute in Active Directory allows an account to hold additional SIDs. This feature is designed to facilitate interoperable account migration between domains, ensuring that all values in the `SID-History` are included in the access tokens. By injecting SIDs into the `SID-History` attribute, adversaries can gain elevated privileges and access resources that would otherwise be restricted.
