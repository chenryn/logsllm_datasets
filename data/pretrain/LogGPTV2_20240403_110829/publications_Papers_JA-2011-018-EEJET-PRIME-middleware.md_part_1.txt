approach to cover the whole triangle. Moreover, many on the
past research initiatives do not truly deal with the core topic
which is interoperability versus just interconnectivity. The
components of ubiquitous computing systems should be able
not only to communicate and exchange data, but also to flex-

learn about the location, status and capabilities of each other,
and jointly engage in different business processes. Moreover,
the components must achieve the above using an always-on,
safe, robust and scalable means of interaction.
In this research related to the inter-middleware conce-
