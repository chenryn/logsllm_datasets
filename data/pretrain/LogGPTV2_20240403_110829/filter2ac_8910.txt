title:botconf2017 Augmented Intelligence to Scale Humans Fighting Botnets
We propose and implement a novel method of discovering botnet activities by identifying new core domains (domains that are directly below a TLD) that appear in real-time DNS query traffic as suspicious, and discovering botnet C&C groups using a domain correlation machine learning model. This method discovers botnet C&C groups before security list vendors which it is benchmarked against.
