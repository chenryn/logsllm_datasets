It sounds like you have Python 2.7 and `py27-virtualenv` installed via MacPorts on your Mac, but when you try to create a new virtual environment using the command `virtualenv demo_venv --no-site-packages`, you encounter an error: `-bash: virtualenv: command not found`.

This issue is likely because the `virtualenv` command for Python 2.7 is specifically named `virtualenv-2.7` instead of just `virtualenv`. You can confirm this by checking the package contents, which will show that no executable named `virtualenv` is installed.

To resolve this, you should use the following command:

```sh
virtualenv-2.7 demo_venv --no-site-packages
```

If you prefer to use the `virtualenv` command directly, you can create a symbolic link to `virtualenv-2.7` in a directory that is included in your system's `PATH`. For example, you can add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`):

```sh
alias virtualenv=/opt/local/bin/virtualenv-2.7
```

Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link in a directory that is already in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

```sh
sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/virtualenv-2.7 /usr/local/bin/virtualenv
```

After creating the alias or symbolic link, you should be able to use the `virtualenv` command as expected.
