User: I have python 2.7 installed via mac ports on a mac. I installed virtualenv via macports (py27-virtualenv @1.6.1_0 (active). When issue the command: virtualenv demo_venv --no-site-packages, I get this error: -bash: virtualenv:command not found. It's not picking virtualenv up @ all, so do I need to symlink it to my python27 location?
Assistant: The command is virtualenv-2.7, not just virtualenv.
If you look at the package contents, you can see that no executable named virtualenv is installed.
