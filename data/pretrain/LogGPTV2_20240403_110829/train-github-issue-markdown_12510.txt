I want to sample `uint8`s uniformly including the maximum value of 255, but
this doesn't work:
    from jax import random, numpy as jnp
    random.randint(random.PRNGKey(0), (10,), 0, 256, jnp.uint8) # [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
The reason is that maxval is converted into the `uint8`. This is in contrast
to
    import numpy as np
    np.random.randint(0, 256, (10,), np.uint8) # [197 133 228 202 216 177 116  78 244 176]
The same happens for all integer datatypes. (Workaround is of course to use a
larger type and then cast.)
