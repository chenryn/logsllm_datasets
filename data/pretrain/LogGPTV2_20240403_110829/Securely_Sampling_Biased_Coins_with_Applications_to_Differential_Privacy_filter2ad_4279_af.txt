Figure 3: d-Sample Benchmark Results. We measure time and communication to produce
d samples from Geo(2/ε) in two network settings. In these graphs, d varies for two choices of ε
and two δ for each ε. We note that ODO does not change based on the form of ε, so we use one
plot for the two values of ε. Across all of these parameters, the MNM technique dominates the
ODO. In graph (c), the gray lines represent the same MNM performance lines from graph (a) for
comparison purposes.
