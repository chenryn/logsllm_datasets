We have been iterating on Dashboard native filer behind the feature flag after
announcing phase 1 testing #12148
All bugs that are identified have been fixed, lots of new features have been
added since then, based on request and feedback from the community. We are
heavily testing this week and will make all features fully available in days.
Many thanks to all the contributors(phase 2) üôè
