Build the Android apk
    flutter build apk --release
Creates apk with:  
`armeabi-v7a/libflutter.so`
but it is missing `libflutter.so` in:  
`arm64-v8a/`
From the build help I see that I can choose arm64
    flutter build apk -h
        --target-platform          [android-arm (default), android-arm64]
Running
    flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm64
includes `libflutter.so` in `arm64-v8a` but not `armeabi-v7a`
For the play store it multiple APKs can be uploaded but for our continues
integration it would be handy to be able to make a fat APK that include all
the platforms and work on all phones without special instructions.
Something like this:
    flutter build apk --release --target-platforms [android-arm,android-arm64]
