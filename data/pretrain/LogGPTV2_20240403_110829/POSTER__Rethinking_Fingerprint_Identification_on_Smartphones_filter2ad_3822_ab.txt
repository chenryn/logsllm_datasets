must be provided or scanned from the target user, for their a(cid:138)ack.
In our experiment, we adopted the Cao et al.’s conductive printing
method for the SCRAP image reconstructed by our a(cid:138)ack. (cid:140)e
forgery procedure is as follows. First of all, we follow the procedure
of the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack, as summarized in Section 2, and prepare a
reconstructed SCRAP image, e.g., as shown in Figure 2-(a). For
conductive printing, we (cid:131)ip horizontally the SCRAP image and
reverse its black/white color, so as to directly submit the print-out
to a touch sensor. Before printing, we reform the reverse image

with SourceAFIS library [9] for improvement. Finally, we print out
the image using AgIC conductive ink and AgIC special paper.
Figures 2-(a) to (c) show a forgery example of the SCRAP image.
We then turn over the printed image and put it on the touch sensor
of Galaxy S6 and S7, as shown in Figure 2-(d). We successfully
unlocked the target smartphones with the conductive print-out
of the SCRAP image. Figure 3-(a) shows that three participants
unlocked Galaxy S7 using the print-out of the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack without
di(cid:129)culties, i.e., in one or two a(cid:138)empts.
We additionally conducted a half submission experiment, as we
described in Figure 1, for the same target devices with participant
P1. We asked P1 to submit only a half of the print-out for unlocking,
and as shown in Figure 3-(b), P1 unlocked Galaxy S7 in two or four
a(cid:138)empts. Since Galaxy S6 and S7 allow up to 14 times in the (cid:128)rst
hour (37 times in the (cid:128)rst 24 hours) along the failed a(cid:138)empts, our
a(cid:138)ack is de(cid:128)nitely actual risk to Samsung Galaxy series.
Unfortunately, we found that the conductive printing methods
failed against iPhone series even with a (cid:128)rm impression. (cid:140)us, we
move on to the wood glue method for iPhones.
3.2 Wood Glue and 3D Printing
Wood glue is a widely-used forgery material for (cid:128)ngerprint spoof-
ing a(cid:138)acks. We also veri(cid:128)ed that wood glue can be used with a
(cid:128)rm impression of a (cid:128)ngerprint to bypass Touch ID of iPhones, as
summarized in Table 1. We asked a participant to (cid:128)rmly press a
candle-based mold, so that the (cid:128)ngerprint is taken in good quality,
and put wood glue onto the mold. We then obtained the forged
(cid:128)ngerprint in silicon-like form, and successfully passed the touch
sensors of both iPhone 5s, 6, 7 and Galaxy S6, S7 by exploiting it.
(cid:140)us, to adopt the SCRAP image in this a(cid:138)ack se(cid:138)ing, we need to
build a mold based on the SCRAP image. For the purpose, we are
working on 3D modeling and printing of a fake 3D (cid:128)ngerprint and
we will use the 3D printout to make a candle-based mold. Figure

We then show the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack is possible and ask users again
about possible changes in their perception. Finally, we introduce
our mitigation method and let participants try our prototype, and
ask them about acceptance of the mitigation method.

4 MITIGATION
To mitigate the forgery problems we raised above, a touch sensor
must be able to obtain a larger area of user’s (cid:128)ngerprint. Inter-
estingly, Apple, Samsung, and many other manufacturers have a
plan to introduce the under-screen touch sensor, which enables a
larger sensor under the touch screen. For instance, Apple recently
patented under-screen (cid:128)ngerprint recognition systems that use
acoustic imaging [3] or conductive scanning [8], expected to be an
alternative to the futuristic Face ID of iPhone X.
With this trend, we proposed a mitigation method assuming the
under-screen touch sensor as shown in Figure 4, and its appearance
is a slight modi(cid:128)cation of the slide bar which was used in the
previous iPhone models [5]. We may expect many users are already
familiar with such an interface. (cid:140)e user is asked to unlock iPhone
by sliding the circle to le(cid:137) or right. When a user touches the circle,
the under-screen touch sensor will read the (cid:128)ngerprint. (cid:140)e swiping
action required to slide the bar will then remove the (cid:128)ngerprint
smudge on the touch sensor as shown in Figure 4-(d). We also
proposed to read the remaining smudges, as shown in Figure 5-(c)
and (f), to distinguish a real (cid:128)ngerprint from a fake (cid:128)ngerprint.
5 CONCLUSION
We performed post hoc experimental studies regarding the SCRAP
a(cid:138)ack [5], which has been introduced recently as a practical at-
tack to circumvent (cid:128)ngerprint identi(cid:128)cation on smartphones, and
the following mitigation method. We have validated prior (cid:128)nger-
print spoo(cid:128)ng techniques to evaluate the practical e(cid:130)ectiveness
of the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack. Based on the previous work, we a(cid:138)empted
to construct a methodology for deceiving smartphone (cid:128)ngerprint
biometrics by combining proven methods and new methods with
SCRAP techniques. Our mitigation method assumed an adoption
of under-screen touch sensors, of which the adaptation is expected
in the near future [3, 8]. So, we also performed a small experiment
to see its e(cid:130)ect on a touch screen.
We plan to conduct a survey study to understand user perception
of the fake (cid:128)ngerprint a(cid:138)acks and the mitigation methods. (cid:140)e
procedure of this survey is as follows. First, we ask users if latent
(cid:128)ngerprints remaining on a smartphone is perceived as actual risk.
