main channel case, the equivocation E increases as ∆ in-
creases. The block error rate BLERm and the bit error rate
BERm of the main channel are shown in Table 2. It is easy
to see that both BERm and BLERm are very close to 0.
That means the system can achieve nearly perfect secrecy
and reliability by introducing the transmission rate trade-
oﬀ.
Compared to the noiseless scenario, Type-II wiretap code
can be used for a noisy main channel, so it can work well for
long-range communications. However, when the main chan-
nel is noisy, a much larger ∆ has to be used to realize nearly
perfect secrecy, i.e., a larger capacity diﬀerence between Cm
and Ce is required and Ce cannot be very large.

6. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND EX-
PERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we ﬁnally implement the wiretap chan-
nel and use real-world experiments to evaluate the system
performance. As shown in Fig. 13 (a), we build a commu-
nication prototype consisting of three USRP N210 devices
with WBX daughter boards operating in the 850MHz as Al-
ice, Bob and Eve, respectively. Alice and Bob are deployed
and tested in the green area, Eve is deployed and tested in
the red area. Note that, in the blue area, the eavesdropper’s
channel may be too good that it is not suitable for gener-
ating enough capacity diﬀerence to implement the wiretap
channel (in the worst channel case).
In our experiment, we evaluate the performance of the
worst channel case and the case where instantaneous channel
capacity feedback is available to deal with the variation of
channel states. Similar to the simulation study, we limit
the message to be 10bits, and transmit 100000 codewords.
Finally, we calculate the equivocation and the bit error rate
at the eavesdropper, and the bit error rate and the block
error rate at the receiver.
6.1 Performance Evaluation of the Worst Cha
-nnel Case
For the worst channel case, the maximum capacity of the
eavesdropper’s channel is obtained by experiments over a
long period of time, but the real-time capacity of the eaves-
dropper’s channel is not available. Through experiments, we
ﬁnd that the main channel is almost error-free if the receiver
is close to the sender, say they are within one room.
We ﬁrst evaluate the system performance when the main
channel is noiseless and Type-I wiretap code is adopted for
message encoding. In the experiments, it is required that
e
Eve is within “restricted zones” such that the eavesdrop-
per’s channel capacity is always below the speciﬁc Cmax
.
Fig. 14 shows the distribution of the received messages for
the worst channel case with and without transmission rate
tradeoﬀ ∆ when n = 240, respectively. Table 3 shows E and
BERe for n = 120 and 240. The results indicate that the
system performance is almost the same for the worst channel
cases with and without introducing ∆. This is because the
worst channel case inherently has overestimated the capac-
ity of the eavesdropper’s channel, and additional tradeoﬀs
may not be needed to guarantee nearly perfect secrecy. Due
to this reason, the system can achieve nearly perfect secure
communications for the worst channel case without using
our proposed tradeoﬀ approach.
We then evaluate the system performance when the main
channel is noisy and Type-II wiretap code is adopted for
message encoding. In the experiments, it is required that
the receiver is located in the area with Cm always larger
than the speciﬁc Cmin
m while the eavesdropper is located
in the “restricted zones” with Ce always smaller than the
speciﬁc Cmax
. Fig. 15 shows the distribution of the received
messages, and the bit error rate and the block error rate
are shown in Table 4. It can be seen that the system also
achieves nearly perfect secrecy and high reliability.
e
In summary, the advantage of communicating message un-
der the worst case channel is that we do not need to know
the real-time channel state information for obtaining secrecy
and reliability, but it faces a limitation that the eavesdrop-
per should be restricted to be certain areas.
6.2 Performance Evaluation of the Dynamic
Feedback Case
In this application scenario, we deploy additional USRP
N210 nodes on the ﬂoor to help estimate and transmit the
instantaneous capacities of the main channel and the eaves-
dropper’s channel. As shown in Fig. 4, the capacity only
changes slightly between two frames. Thus, in our imple-
mentation a training sequence is transmitted to help esti-
mate the channel capacities, based on which we can dynam-
ically adjust the coding design.
We ﬁrst evaluate the system performance when then main
channel is noiseless and Type-I wiretap code is adopted for
message encoding.
In order to guarantee secrecy, we set

the transmission rate tradeoﬀ ∆ = 0.3. Fig. 16 shows the
distribution of the received messages at the eavesdropper,
and Table 5 reports the corresponding bit error rate and
block error rate. Similar conclusions can be drawn as those
of the worst channel case.
We then evaluate the system performance when the main
channel is noisy and Type-II wiretap code is adopted for
message encoding. Fig. 17 shows the distribution of the re-
ceived messages, and Table 6 reports the results under our
pre-deﬁned evaluation metrics. Not surprisingly, nearly per-
fect secrecy can also be guaranteed. With dynamic capacity
feedbacks, the eavesdropper does not have to be constrained
in “restricted zones”, but additional nodes need to be de-
ployed to help to estimate the channel capacities.
7. CONCLUSIONS
This paper investigated the design and implementation
of a secret message communication system under the classic
wireless wiretap channel model. This is the ﬁrst work to pro-
vide practical solutions with a comprehensive performance
evaluation to our best knowledge. We tackled many chal-
lenges in the protocol design and implementation, and be-
lieve that the results and ﬁndings in this work can be viewed
as the ﬁrst step towards bridging the gap between the the-
oretical wiretap channel and its practice. Our immediate
future work is to jointly consider the power allocation in
optimizing the system performance in terms of secrecy rate
and also explore the practicality of other advanced wiretap
coding technqiues in the system implementation.
