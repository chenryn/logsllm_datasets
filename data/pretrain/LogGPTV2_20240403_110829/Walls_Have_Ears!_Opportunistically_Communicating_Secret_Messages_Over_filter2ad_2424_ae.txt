### Table 2: Performance Comparison under Different \( n \) and \( \Delta \) for Type-II Code

In the main channel case, the equivocation \( E \) increases as \( \Delta \) increases. The block error rate (BLER\(_m\)) and the bit error rate (BER\(_m\)) of the main channel are shown in Table 2. It is evident that both BER\(_m\) and BLER\(_m\) are very close to 0, indicating that the system can achieve nearly perfect secrecy and reliability by introducing a transmission rate trade-off.

Compared to the noiseless scenario, Type-II wiretap codes can be used for noisy main channels, making them suitable for long-range communications. However, when the main channel is noisy, a much larger \( \Delta \) is required to achieve nearly perfect secrecy. This means a larger capacity difference between \( C_m \) and \( C_e \) is necessary, and \( C_e \) cannot be very large.

### 6. System Implementation and Experimental Results

In this section, we implement the wiretap channel and use real-world experiments to evaluate the system performance. As shown in Figure 13(a), we build a communication prototype consisting of three USRP N210 devices with WBX daughter boards operating at 850 MHz, representing Alice, Bob, and Eve, respectively. Alice and Bob are deployed and tested in the green area, while Eve is deployed and tested in the red area. Note that in the blue area, the eavesdropper's channel may be too good, making it unsuitable for generating enough capacity difference to implement the wiretap channel (in the worst channel case).

In our experiment, we evaluate the performance of the worst channel case and the case where instantaneous channel capacity feedback is available to handle the variation of channel states. We limit the message to 10 bits and transmit 100,000 codewords. Finally, we calculate the equivocation and the bit error rate at the eavesdropper, and the bit error rate and the block error rate at the receiver.

#### 6.1 Performance Evaluation of the Worst Channel Case

For the worst channel case, the maximum capacity of the eavesdropper's channel is obtained through long-term experiments, but the real-time capacity is not available. Our experiments show that the main channel is almost error-free if the receiver is close to the sender, such as within one room.

We first evaluate the system performance when the main channel is noiseless and Type-I wiretap code is adopted for message encoding. In the experiments, it is required that Eve is within "restricted zones" such that the eavesdropper's channel capacity is always below the specific \( C_{max}^e \). Figure 14 shows the distribution of the received messages for the worst channel case with and without the transmission rate trade-off \( \Delta \) when \( n = 240 \). Table 3 indicates that the system performance is almost the same for the worst channel cases with and without introducing \( \Delta \). This is because the worst channel case inherently overestimates the eavesdropper's channel capacity, and additional trade-offs may not be needed to ensure nearly perfect secrecy. Therefore, the system can achieve nearly perfect secure communications for the worst channel case without using our proposed trade-off approach.

Next, we evaluate the system performance when the main channel is noisy and Type-II wiretap code is adopted for message encoding. In the experiments, it is required that the receiver is located in an area where \( C_m \) is always larger than the specific \( C_{min}^m \), while the eavesdropper is located in "restricted zones" with \( C_e \) always smaller than the specific \( C_{max}^e \). Figure 15 shows the distribution of the received messages, and the bit error rate and the block error rate are presented in Table 4. It can be seen that the system also achieves nearly perfect secrecy and high reliability.

In summary, the advantage of communicating under the worst-case channel is that we do not need to know the real-time channel state information to obtain secrecy and reliability. However, it faces the limitation that the eavesdropper should be restricted to certain areas.

#### 6.2 Performance Evaluation of the Dynamic Feedback Case

In this application scenario, we deploy additional USRP N210 nodes on the floor to help estimate and transmit the instantaneous capacities of the main channel and the eavesdropper's channel. As shown in Figure 4, the capacity changes slightly between two frames. In our implementation, a training sequence is transmitted to help estimate the channel capacities, allowing us to dynamically adjust the coding design.

We first evaluate the system performance when the main channel is noiseless and Type-I wiretap code is adopted for message encoding. To guarantee secrecy, we set the transmission rate trade-off \( \Delta = 0.3 \). Figure 16 shows the distribution of the received messages at the eavesdropper, and Table 5 reports the corresponding bit error rate and block error rate. Similar conclusions can be drawn as those of the worst channel case.

We then evaluate the system performance when the main channel is noisy and Type-II wiretap code is adopted for message encoding. Figure 17 shows the distribution of the received messages, and Table 6 reports the results under our predefined evaluation metrics. Not surprisingly, nearly perfect secrecy can also be guaranteed. With dynamic capacity feedbacks, the eavesdropper does not have to be constrained in "restricted zones," but additional nodes need to be deployed to help estimate the channel capacities.

### 7. Conclusions

This paper investigates the design and implementation of a secret message communication system under the classic wireless wiretap channel model. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to provide practical solutions with a comprehensive performance evaluation. We addressed many challenges in the protocol design and implementation, and believe that the results and findings in this work can be viewed as the first step towards bridging the gap between the theoretical wiretap channel and its practice. Our immediate future work is to jointly consider power allocation in optimizing the system performance in terms of secrecy rate and explore the practicality of other advanced wiretap coding techniques in the system implementation.
