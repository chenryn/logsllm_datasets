### Title: Exploiting Windows COM/WinRT Services: A Deep Dive into Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques

#### Abstract:
The Component Object Model (COM) and Windows Runtime (WinRT) are integral to Windows systems, facilitating cross-process communication and enabling the development of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications. These technologies, however, present a significant attack surface for hackers seeking Local Privilege Escalation (LPE), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Sandbox Escape vulnerabilities.

Over the past year, our team has identified over 100 vulnerabilities in COM and WinRT services. We have classified these vulnerabilities based on their types, including Use-After-Free (UAF), Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Read/Write, Type Confusion, and Arbitrary Read/Write. In this presentation, we will share our methodologies for discovering these vulnerabilities and provide insights into the exploitation techniques we have developed for some of these bugs.

#### Key Points:
- **Overview of COM and WinRT**: Understanding the role and architecture of COM and WinRT in Windows systems.
- **Vulnerability Classification**: Detailed breakdown of the different types of vulnerabilities found.
- **Discovery Methods**: Techniques and tools used to identify these vulnerabilities.
- **Exploitation Techniques**: Case studies and demonstrations of how certain vulnerabilities can be exploited.

By sharing our findings and methods, we aim to contribute to the broader security community's understanding of these critical attack vectors and help improve the overall security posture of Windows systems.
