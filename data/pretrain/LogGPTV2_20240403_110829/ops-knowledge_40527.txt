User: Working on different projects I have the choice of selecting different programming languages, as long as the task is done.
I was wondering what the real difference is, in terms of performance, between writing a program in Python, versus doing it in C.
The tasks to be done are pretty varied, e.g. sorting textfiles, disk access, network access, textfile parsing.
Is there really a noticeable difference between sorting a textfile using the same algorithm in C versus Python, for example?
And in your experience, given the power of current CPU's (i7), is it really a noticeable difference (Consider that its a program that doesnt bring the system to its knees).
Assistant: In general IO bound work will depend more on the algorithm then the language. In this case I would go with Python because it will have first class strings and lots of easy to use libraries for manipulating files, etc.
