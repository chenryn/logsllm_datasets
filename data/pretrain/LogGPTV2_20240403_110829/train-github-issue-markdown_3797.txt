As a developer, I want to be able to write a service worker and use it both in
clients (user agents / web browsers) and in servers.
If `deno` adds support for installing service workers with support for
`install`, `activate`, `fetch` and other `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` events
then isomorphic service workers become a possibility.
