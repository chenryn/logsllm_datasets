Question: "In an effort to optimize an Android application's performance while maintaining security, you are analyzing the different compilation methods used by the Android platform to execute applications. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation methods on Android?"
 "A": "AOT improves app start times but increases system update time due to recompilation of applications."
 "B": "JIT increases installation time since the entire application is compiled at install time."
 "C": "AOT results in less optimized code because it compiles without usage patterns, leading to slower execution."
 "D": "JIT allows for continuous optimization of frequently used code paths at runtime, but may introduce slight execution delays."
