**ATT&CK ID:** G0047  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Gamaredon Group

The Gamaredon Group has been observed testing connectivity between a compromised machine and a command-and-control (C2) server. This is typically done using the `ping` command, such as:

```cmd
%CSIDL_SYSTEM%\cmd.exe /c ping -n 1 <C2_SERVER_IP>
```

This command sends a single ICMP echo request to the specified C2 server IP address to check if the connection is active.
