User: Apparently I can't get the process resources usage in Mac OS X with psutil after the process got reaped, i.e. after p.wait() where p is a psutil.Popen() instance. So for example, if I try ps.cpu_times().system where ps is a psutil.Process() instance, I get a raise of no such process. What are the other options for measuring the resources usage in a mac  (elapsed time, memory and cpu usage)?
Assistant: If the process "dies" or gets reaped how are you supposed to interact with it? Of course you can't, 'cause it's gone. If on the other hand the process is a zombie, then in that case you might be able to extract some info off of it, like the parent PID, but not CPU or memory stats.
