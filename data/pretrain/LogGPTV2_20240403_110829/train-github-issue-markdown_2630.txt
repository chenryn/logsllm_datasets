  * Electron Version: 2.0.6
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): Windows
  * Last known working Electron version: Unknown
**Expected Behavior**  
Using the `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` method, it should return
a success and a position  
object which contains a coords object. When I access it using a browser, it
works as expected, using the same code but on chrome (Version 68.0.3440.84)
instead of the electron application it works as expected. It does not work on
my Electron application.
**Actual behavior**  
The error function gets called and I receive the following error: { Code: 2,
Message: "Network location provider at 'https://www.googleapis.com/' :
Returned error code 403" }. Code 2 meaning POSITION_UNAVAILABLE.
**To Reproduce**
