Estimation Procedure. Keep log n CM sketches, in order to answer range queries Q(l;r) ap-
2
proximately. Any range query can be reduced to at most 2log n dyadic range queries, which in
2
turn can each be reduced to a single point query. Each point in the range [1:::n] is a member of
log ndyadicranges,oneforeachy in therange0:::log (n)1.Asketchis keptforeachset of
2 2
dyadic ranges of length 2y, and update each of these for every update that arrives. Then, given a
rangequeryQ(l;r),computetheatmost2log ndyadicrangeswhichcanonicallycovertherange,

andposethat manypointqueriesto thesketches,returningthesumofthe queriesasthe estimate.

Let a[l;r] = r a be the answer to the query Q(l;r) and let a^[l;r] be the estimate using the

The above theorem states the bound for the standard CM sketch size. The guarantee will be more
usefulwhenstatedwithouttermsoflognintheapproximationbound.Thiscanbechangedbyin-
creasing the size of the sketch, which is equivalent to rescaling ".In particular, if we want to esti-

Onewayto computeapproximate rangesumsis via approximatequantiles: useanalgorithmsuch
as [25,22] to find the  quantiles of the stream, and then count how many quantiles fall within the
range of interest to give an O(") approximation of the range query. Such an approach has several
disadvantages: (1) Existing approximate quantile methods work in the cash register model, rather
than the more general turnstile model that our solutions work in. (2) The time cost to update the
datastructurecanbehigh,sometimeslinearinthesizesizeofthestructure.(3)Existingalgorithms
assume single items arriving one by one, so they do not handle fractional values or large values
being added, which can be easily handled by sketch-based approaches. (4) The worst case space

The best previous bounds for this problem in the turnstile model are given in [21], where range

5 ApplicationsofCount-MinSketches
By using CM sketches, we show how to improve best known time and space bounds for the two
problemsfromSection2.
5.1 Quantiles inthe TurnstileModel
In[21]theauthorsshowedthatfinding theapproximate-quantilesofthedatasubjecttoinsertions
and deletions can be reduced to the problem of computing range sums. Put simply, the algorithm
is to do binary searches for ranges 1:::r whose range sum a[1;r] is kjjajj for 1  k  1 1.

Theorem 5 "-approximate -quantiles can be found with probability at least 1   by keeping a
data structure with space O(1 log2(n)log(logn)). The time for each insert or delete operation is
" 
O(log(n)log(logn)),and thetime tofindeachquantileondemand isO(log(n)log(logn)).
Choosing CM sketches over Random Subset Sums improves both the query time and the update
timefromO( 1 log2(n)log logn),byafactorofmorethan 34 logn.Thespacerequirementsarealso

It is illustrative to contrast our bounds with those for the problem in the weaker Cash Register
Modelwhereitemsareonlyinserted(recallthatinourstrongerTurnstilemodel,itemsaredeletedas

5.2 Heavy Hitters
We consider this problem in both the cash register model (meaning that all updates are positive)
and the more challenging turnstile model (where updates are both positive and negative, with the
restrictionthatcount ofanyitemis neverlessthan zero,i.e.,a (t)  0.).

PROOF. Thisprocedurereliesonthefactthatthethresholdvalueincreasesmonotonically:there-

increasing. By checking the estimated value every time an items value increases, no heavy hitters
willbeomitted.Bytheone-sidederrorguaranteeofsketches,everyheavyhitterisincludedinthe
output, but there is some possibility of including non-heavy hitters in the output. To do this, the
parameter  is scaled to ensure that over all jjajj queries posed to the sketch, the probability of

case space usage. Meanwhile, a deterministic algorithm in the same paper solves the problem in
worst case space O(1 log jjajj1). However, for both algorithms in [26] the time cost of processing

each insertion can be high ((1)): periodically, there are operations with cost linear in the space
"
used.For highspeedapplications,ourworstcasetimeboundmay bepreferable.
Turnstile Case. We adopt the solution given in [8], which describes a divide and conquer pro-
cedure to find the heavy hitters. This keeps sketches for computing range sums: logn different
sketches, one for each different dyadic range. When an update (i ;c ) arrives, then each of these
t t
isupdatedasbefore.Inordertofind alltheheavyhitters,aparallelbinarysearchisperformed,de-
scending one level of the hierarchy at each step. Nodes in the hierarchy (corresponding to dyadic

investigatedrecursively.Allsingleitemsfoundinthiswaywhoseapproximatedcountexceedsthe
thresholdareoutput.
Weinsteadmustlimitthenumberofitemsoutputwhosetruefrequencyislessthanthefraction.
This is achieved by setting the probability of failure for each sketch to be  . This is because,
2logn
at each level there are at most 1= items with frequency more than . At most twice this number
ofqueriesaremadeateachlevel,forallofthe lognlevels.Byscaling likethisandapplyingthe
unionbound ensuresthat,over all the queries,the totalprobability thatany one(ormore)of them
overestimated by more than a fraction " is bounded by , and so the probability that every query
succeedsis1.Itfollowsthat

itemwhosefrequencyis lessthanjjajj isoutput.

The previous best known bound appears in [8], where a non-adaptive group testing approach was
described. Here, the space bounds agree asymptotically but have been improved in constant fac-
tors; a further improvement is in the nature of the guarantee: previous methods gave probabilistic
guarantees about outputting the heavy hitters. Here, there is absolute certainty that this procedure
will find and outputevery heavy hitter,because the CM sketchesnever underestimate counts, and
strongguaranteesaregiven thatno non-heavyhitterswillbeoutput.Thisis oftendesirable.
