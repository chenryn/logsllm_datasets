Figure 13: Bit error rate over distance for backscatter
and passive receiver modes at different bitrates.
Transmitter–Receiver Efﬁciency: We now turn to the
achievable region in terms of the TX:RX power ratios of-
fered by two Braidio radios that are separated by different
distances. Figure 14 shows how the supported power ra-
tios change as separation increases from 0.3m to 6m (using
the representation in Figure 9). Each triangle refers to the
achievable region at a particular distance between the trans-
mitter and receiver. The shaded region in each triangle rep-
resents the possible operating points if we multiplexed be-
tween the different modes. The two lines on the left repre-
sent cases where the backscatter mode no longer operates, so
we only have the active and passive receiver modes, making
the possible operating points a line.
At 0.3m, all the links are available at the highest bitrate.
Braidio operates primarily in passive receiver or backscatter
mode at this distance, and switches between them to achieve
different power ratios. The dynamic range that can be sup-
ported by Braidio is largest at this range — it can support

As the distance increases, the backscatter link switches
from 1Mbps to 100kbps at 0.9m and ﬁnally to 10kbps at
1.8m. This drops the efﬁciency of the transmitter and re-
ceiver, and the triangle becomes increasingly obtuse. In oth-
er words, Braidio can still offer asymmetric power modes,
but they just become a bit more expensive in terms of bit-
s/joule at the transmitter and receiver. So, the overall gains
reduce as the separation increases.
Beyond 2.4m, the backscatter mode becomes unavailable.
At this point, only the active and passive receiver modes are
viable, so the operating region is a line between these modes.
Note that since backscatter is the only mode that ofﬂoads the
carrier to the receiver, the nature of asymmetry that is sup-
ported after 2.6m is favors the receiver rather than transmit-
ter. As distance increases further, the passive receiver mode
also drops in supported bitrate, until after 4.5m, only the ac-
tive mode is available and the feasible region shrinks to a
single point.
Switching overhead: We also characterized the switch-
ing overhead of Braidio in different modes. The result is
shown in Table 5. Notice that for the Backscatter case, we
use the worse scenario, i.e.
the link speed is only 10kbp-
s. Experimental results indicate that switching overhead is
negligible in all modes.
6.3 Braidio for Portables
In this section we look at how the ability to operate in an
asymmetric manner can be useful across a range of portable
devices with different battery capacities. To understand this,
we design a simulator that simulates link behavior based on

Figure 15: Performance gain of Braidio over Bluetooth

the above described experimental characterization, and out-
puts the simulated performance given as input the energy
levels of two end points and the trafﬁc pattern between them.
Our simulator includes a full implementation of the energy-
aware carrier ofﬂoad algorithm described in §4. Note that
the results only consider the communication subsystem, and
real-world performance would depend on other factors as
well. But the goal is to illustrate the potential beneﬁts if
communication were the power bottleneck.
Our experiments in this section cover communication be-
tween devices ranging from wrist-worn ﬁtness bands with
small batteries to laptop-class devices with much larger bat-
teries. We report the results as a matrix where each cell cor-
responds to the performance gains over a baseline method
i.e. if the device on the x co-ordinate of the cell were com-
municating with the device on the y co-ordinate of the cell
using Braidio vs a baseline method, how many more total
bits can be communicated between the transmitter and re-
ceiver when we use Braidio. The shading of the cells in
the matrix corresponds to the magnitude of the gains (larger
gains means more darkly shaded cells).
Scenario 1: Different battery sizes
Figure 15 shows the result when a transmitter (x axis) trans-
mits data continuously to a receiver (y-axis). In this exper-
iment, we assume that the transmitter and receiver are less
than one meter apart, so all modes can operate at their peak
bitrate. Both end points start with a full battery, and we
record the number of bits transmitted until either the trans-
mitter or receiver runs out of battery.
The ﬁgure shows that Braidio outperforms Bluetooth by
up to 397×. The maximum gains correspond to the sce-
narios where a device with a small battery is transmitting
to a device with a large battery since backscatter mode can
be leveraged, or when a device with large battery transmit-
s to a device with small battery in which case the passive
receiver can be leveraged. In reality, some devices gener-
ate more data than others, so the more data-rich devices are
the ones most likely to beneﬁt from Braidio. For example,
the Pivothead is a device that has an outward-facing camera
and streams at 30fps (similar to GoPro and Google Glass),
and Braidio improves lifetime by 35× for communication
between this device and a laptop.
Curiously, the diagonal lines from upper left to bottom
right in Figure 15 show the performance gain of Braidio even
when the energy ratio is 1:1 i.e. both transmitter and receiv-
er have the same amount of energy. While this may seem
counter-intuitive, the gains occur because Braidio does not
turn on the carrier on both ends unlike an active radio. So,
Bluetooth turns on the carrier on both ends whereas Braidio
turns on the carrier at one of the ends but ends up using
higher power at that end compared to Bluetooth. Even so,
Braidio can get 43% performance improvement over a com-
mercial radios since the transceiver on each side only need
to generate the carrier for half of the time.
Braidio v.s.
the best of the operating modes: One u-
nanswered question in the above experiment is whether the
two devices end up using only one of the operating modes
throughout the experiment, or whether they switch between
the different modes as the amount of energy at the end points
dwindle. To understand the beneﬁts of switching between
the different Braidio modes, we look at the total bits commu-
nicated if one of the three modes were exclusively used, and
then compare Braidio against the best of these three modes
in isolation. The results are shown in Figure 16.
The results show that when the battery levels are highly
asymmetric, Braidio almost exclusively uses a single mode,
but when the devices have somewhat similar battery levels, it
switches between the modes. Switching provides up to 78%
improvement across the scenarios tested. In reality, the ener-
gy levels of mobile and wearable devices varies signiﬁcantly
depending on charging and usage patterns, so switching be-
tween modes is necessary to deal with these dynamics.
