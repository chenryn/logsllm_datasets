User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can VPN providers end violating accounts when "they don't log any data"? VPN providers can end accounts which violate their terms of use. If you look at https://nordvpn.com/terms-of-service/ for example, you see that they will terminate accounts violating their ToS. The same is for other providers. 

How do they know you are violating their ToS when "nothing is logged"? That's contradicting as hell. According to a well known comparison chart, some providers which are serious about privacy are Nordvpn, IVPN and BlackVPN. 

I am not planning to violate their ToS, but I am very sceptical about privacy in general.

Assistant: Claim to "not log" is not the same as "not monitor connections". First is saving traces, second is analyzing activity when it happens, that does not necessary generates logs. 

However, while not totally clear, I understand they claim to not monitor too:


  NordVPN does not monitor, store or record logs for any VPN user.


They do not monitor logs (since this is written in their Logging Policy) or connections? Maybe depends on who is asking :)?
