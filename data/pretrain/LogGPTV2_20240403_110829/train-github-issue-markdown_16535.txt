There should be a way to safely rename / revoke / reindex / manipulate an
index.
Currently, I have to do the following:
  1. Create NEW index
  2. Copy (aka reindex) data from OLD to NEW
  3. Delete OLD index
  4. Make an alias/link from OLD index name to NEW index
  5. Do my stuff
  6. Delete OLD index alias
  7. Create OLD index
  8. Copy (aka reindex) data from NEW to OLD index.
  9. Delete OLD index.
3-4 transition is a race cond. If app is heavily writing to index, you're out
of luck. Your index will be constantly created, you won't be able to even make
an alias.  
6-7 is a potential race condition.
To work around the problem, we need aliases to work with existing indexes.  
Also, an index rename functionality should be implemented, so that entire 4-7
would not be needed.
