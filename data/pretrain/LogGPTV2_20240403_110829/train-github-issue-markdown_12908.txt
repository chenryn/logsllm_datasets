Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.900]
    PowerToys version: v19.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
Move the taskbar to the top of the screen screen and set up FancyZones.
# Expected behavior
An option in fancyzones to select the taskbar location
# Actual behavior
FancyZones is not accounting for the fact that i have my taskbar at the top of
my screen. In v18 this was not an issue but since i updated to v19 (and then
to v19.1) all my windows are moved up to account for the taskbar to be at the
bottom whereas mine is at the top
