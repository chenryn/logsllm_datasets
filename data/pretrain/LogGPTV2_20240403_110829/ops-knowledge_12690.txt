Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple attempts to establish a connection between two software components, QuorumCnxManager and QuorumCnxManager$SendWorker. The connection is repeatedly interrupted due to errors, and the SendWorker is leaving the thread. Two connection requests are received from 10.10.34.13 and 10.10.34.11, but the connection is not established.
