**Current behavior**  
Currently Angular does not have native support, so when we have a form that
has an Input = File, we have to implement customizations so that when sending
the form, the file is also sent via multipart/form-data.  
There are some code examples, such as:  
angular2-multipartForm  
But these libraries do not integrate very well with the Angular.
**Expected behavior**  
It would be very interesting if in future versions Angular had native support
for "input=file" and multipart/form-data.  
Adding compatibility with File API.  
This would make it much easier for developers who want to implement this type
of field in their application forms.  
There are some libraries for this, such as: angular2-multipartForm, ng2-file-
upload  
However, they do not implement very well, or are not updated or break the good
practices of the Angular.
