**Current Behavior**
Currently, Angular does not provide native support for handling file inputs and multipart/form-data. As a result, when a form contains an `<input type="file">`, developers must implement custom solutions to ensure that the file is sent along with the form data using `multipart/form-data`.

There are some third-party libraries, such as `angular2-multipartForm` and `ng2-file-upload`, but they often do not integrate seamlessly with Angular's core features and may not adhere to best practices.

**Expected Behavior**
It would be beneficial if future versions of Angular included native support for `<input type="file">` and `multipart/form-data`. This would simplify the process for developers who need to include file upload functionality in their forms. Additionally, integrating the File API would further enhance this feature.

**Environment Details:**
- **Angular Version:** 4.0
- **Browsers Affected:** All
- **Programming Languages:** All
- **Node Version (for AoT issues):** 6.10

**Additional Context:**
- While there are existing libraries like `angular2-multipartForm` and `ng2-file-upload`, they often have limitations, such as poor integration with Angular, lack of updates, and deviation from Angular's best practices.
- Native support for file uploads and multipart/form-data would improve the developer experience and reduce the need for external dependencies.
