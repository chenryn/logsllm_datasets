User: I have been programming in Python for a while now, and have created some utilities that I use a lot.  Whenever I start a new project, I start writing, and as I need these utilities I copy them from where ever I think the latest version of the particular utility is.  I have enough projects now that I am losing track of where the latest version is.  And, I will upgrade one of these scripts to fix a problem in a specific situation, and then wish it had propagated back to all of the other projects that use that script.
I am thinking the best way to solve this problem is to create a directory in the site-packages directory, and put all of my utility modules in there.  And then add this directory to the sys.path directory list.
Is this the best way to solve this problem?
How do modify my installation of Python so that this directory is always added to sys.path, and I don't have to explicitly modify sys.path at the beginning of each module that needs to use these utilities?
I'm using Python 2.5 on Windows XP, and Wing IDE.
Assistant: If it's not in site-packages then you can add a file with the extension .pth to your site-packages directory. 
The file should have one path per line, that you want included in sys.path
