### Problem Description
window.prompt is not implemented and may break websites that rely on the
feature  
window.alert etc. are also subpar compared to e.g. Google Chrome
implementation
### Proposed Solution
Offer middleware API to define Custom behaviour of these APIs.  
The default can stay how it is but it might be good to define custom functions
that those window calls then get routed to.
### Alternatives Considered
I know it's not too important for the content of the App but for things like
building an In-App browser etc., the experience is currently a lot worse than
Google Chrome and similar.
