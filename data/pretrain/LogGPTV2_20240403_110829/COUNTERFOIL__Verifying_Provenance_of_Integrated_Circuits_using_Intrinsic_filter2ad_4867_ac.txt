a requirement of being within 2 pixels of the location where
the homography predicts the enrolled keypoint to be in the
veriﬁcation image. This ensures that matched features are not
only similar, but also geometrically consistent with relative
positions of the enrolled keypoints. Fig. 5 shows the pixel
distance between the homography projection of an enrolled
keypoint and the location of the veriﬁcation keypoint that is
its nearest neighbor in feature space. The data is collected
from 100 different veriﬁcation trials. The peak at left indicates
that the nearest neighbor is often found within two pixels of
the location predicted by the homography. These points are
the inliers.
Fig. 6 shows examples of keypoint matching from veriﬁca-
tion. The matching succeeds even when the veriﬁcation image
is rotated and at a different scale from the orientation of the
same chip at enrollment. Each line on the ﬁgure shows the
correspondence between an enrolled keypoint and a matching
keypoint found on the package during veriﬁcation.

5 System Evaluation
We evaluate the COUNTERFOIL system using experiments
on populations of two plastic dual in-line package (PDIP)
chips. The ﬁrst is an Alliance Memory AS6C6264-55PCN [3],
which is a 64kb SRAM in a 28-pin PDIP (surface size 35.6mm
× 15.2mm) that is rated for 0◦C to 70◦C temperature range.
The second is a Microchip Technology 23LC1024 [39], which
is a 1Mb SRAM in an 8-pin PDIP (9.2mm × 6.4mm) that
is rated for −40◦C to 85◦C. Images are collected using two
instances of two different camera models. The two ViTiny
UM12 cameras [56] cost $390 each, have 5MP sensors, and
computer-controlled focus through software. The two Must-
Cam UM012C cameras cost $40 each, have 5MP sensors, and
manual focus by turning a dial. Our collection of chips and
cameras are shown in Fig 7.
In our evaluation we use 52 instances of chip model
AS6C6264 and 40 instances of chip model 23LC1024. Chips
packaged in the same mold are identiﬁed by the mold marking
on the package. Our dataset has several chips packaged from
the same mold: 5 pairs, 9 multiples in chip model AS6C6264
and 14 pairs in chip model 23LC1024. Each chip instance is
enrolled to the database using one camera, and then veriﬁed
using the other camera of the same model. Enrollment and
veriﬁcation is repeated 3 times for each chip, comprising a
total of 528 images taken with ViTiny and MustCam.
5.1 Package Authentication
Package authentication is performed by matching veriﬁca-
tion image features with enrolled ones as described in Sec.
4. Fig. 8 shows in green the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) of the number of inliers (matched keypoints) from the
dataset of enrolled and veriﬁcation chip images using our
system. Fig. 8 also shows in red the CDF of inliers for mis-
labeled packages. In these cases, the program is modiﬁed to
ignore the identity encoded on the label, and to fetch from the
database the enrolled keypoints of another, randomly selected
chip instance of the same model. 5,000 such comparisons are

enrollment, right side used for veriﬁcation. Separate camera

performed. This CDF represents what a counterfeiter might
achieve by randomly swapping labels. We also consider the
strongest adversary that has an exact duplicate of the mold
that was used by the trusted packaging house to produce the
enrolled chip, and he copies the label for the legitimate en-
rolled chip onto his counterfeits created from the same mold.
The lines in blue show the number of inliers that the coun-
terfeit would be able to achieve in this permissive setting.
Even if the attacker has the same mold used to produce an
enrolled chip, the counterfeits that can be created with the
mold typically still have signiﬁcantly fewer inliers than the
enrolled chip.
The veriﬁer’s decision to accept or reject a package is made
according to whether the number of matched enrollment key-
points exceeds a threshold. A higher threshold is a more
selective determination of authenticity. Higher thresholds can
reduce both false positives (counterfeits accepted as authen-
tic) and true positives (legitimate chips accepted as authentic).
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are plots that
show the achievable rates of true and false positives as the
acceptance threshold is varied. A true positive always refers
to a case where the enrolled and veriﬁed chip are the same
instance with the same label, but we use two different no-
tions of a false positive. The ﬁrst case of false positive is

from a different mold. The second case of false positive is
a counterfeit chip with a label used to enroll another chip
from the same mold as itself. The ﬁrst case corresponds to
a typical unsophisticated counterfeiter, and the second is to
provide an idea of what a determined and well-equipped at-
tacker may be able to achieve. The ROC curves are shown in
Fig. 9. For both models of chip and both models of camera,
we are able to distinguish perfectly (100% true positives at
0% false positives) between a legitimate chip being veriﬁed
and a counterfeit from a different mold. Even in the extreme
case where the counterfeiter has the same mold (from the
packaging house) used to create the enrolled chip, it is pos-
sible to detect the counterfeits while still keeping a high rate
of true positives. The worst case is AS6C6264 with ViTiny
camera (Fig. 9b), where it is still possible to accept 90% of
legitimate chips while allowing only 10% of counterfeits cre-
ated from the same mold. We will show later in the paper that
this performance can be further improved by higher quality
images. Note that the worst-case scenario of counterfeits from
the same mold that produces legitimate chips demonstrates
the effectiveness of COUNTERFOIL, but our assumption of a
trusted packaging house precludes an adversary having this
capability.
COUNTERFOIL is intended to be a scalable solution for
provenance, so it is important to consider the possibility of
collisions when enrolling ﬁngerprints of many packages. Be-
cause the packaging house in possession of the molds is
trusted, we focus on collisions that might occur in the or-
dinary scenario of a proﬁt-seeking attacker that is using dif-
ferent molds to create counterfeit chips. A collision occurs
when a veriﬁcation ﬁngerprint of package (A) is accepted
as matching enrolled ﬁngerprints from two different-mold
packages (A) and (B). This collision is a true positive authen-
tication of package (A), and a false positive authentication
of package (A) against the enrolled ﬁngerprint of (B). We
are able to avoid false positives between different-mold chips
in our limited dataset, so we use a simple model to estimate
the false positive probability of a larger dataset. Enrolled ﬁn-
gerprints have an average of 3936 keypoints in a 2mm2 ROI,
and we ﬁnd empirically that each keypoint will become an
inlier with probability 1.0E-3 when compared to a veriﬁca-
tion ﬁngerprint from a different mold. Under the simplifying
assumption that all keypoints have the same probability of
being inliers, the number of inliers will follow a binomial
distribution, and we can calculate the probability of inliers
falsely exceeding the acceptance threshold. We choose for the
model an acceptance threshold equal to the minimum number
of inliers between same-chip comparisons, which is 48. The
probability of having a false positive is then 5.6E-36, which
is the estimated collision probability between two ﬁngerprints
from different molds. A collision probability of 5.6E-36 im-
plies that the enrolled ﬁngerprints have entropy of 117-bit
random binary strings.

5.2 Runtime
Verifying provenance of packages should not slow manufac-
turing (for enroller) or integration (for veriﬁer). The veriﬁ-
cation process is more computationally intensive than en-
rollment, and certain target applications for veriﬁcation may
impose stringent latency requirements. For example, we envi-
sion that one application is integration with a pick-and-place
machine, which removes chips from feeder reels and places
them appropriately onto printed circuit board pads for re-
ﬂow soldering. Single head pick-and-place machines from a
leading manufacturer place between 1,800 and 5,000 parts
per hour [37], which corresponds to handling each part for
720ms to 2s. Fig. 10 shows that package veriﬁcation can be
performed at production speed, as our system is able to au-
thenticate each instance within 150 ms on an Intel Xeon CPU
E5-2690. The runtime can be further reduced to meet even
tighter latency requirements by enrolling a smaller number
keypoints for each chip. Fig. 10 shows how runtime scales
with the size of ROI at a constant keypoint density, and shows
the breakdown of runtime by task. Enrolling a larger area
of the chip surface increases the number of inliers and the
total runtime. The next two subsections consider the runtime
implications of algorithm choices.
5.2.1 Image Processing
Table 1 compares the runtime and authentication performance
of four popular algorithms for feature extraction and match-
ing. While all of the algorithms are suitable, we ﬁnd ORB to
perform best, and have thus chosen it for our work. In particu-
lar, the speedup of ORB comes largely from its compatibility
of using locality-based hashing to identify near neighbors,
without using the k-nearest neighbor search which is the most
time consuming operation in the other algorithms.
5.2.2 Digital Signatures
We also evaluate the performance impact of using different
digital signature algorithms such as DSA (3072-bit key) and
ECDSA (256-bit key). For the one-time key generation step,
Figure 10: Runtime of veriﬁcation procedure, broken down by
processing task, for different sizes of ROI. Keypoint density
is held constant at 1,000/mm2. The increase in keypoints for
the larger ROI results in a higher runtime, but also increases
the number of matching points that are found. Runtime can
be traded against accuracy by adjusting the ROI size.
ECDSA is signiﬁcantly faster than DSA, with runtimes of
1.1ms and 2142ms respectively. More important is the runtime
of the repeated steps of signing enrollment records and verify-
ing signatures. Signing and verifying incur runtimes of 1.4ms
and 1.6ms in DSA, and incur runtimes of 1ms and 2.6ms in
ECDSA. Veriﬁcation is the step with real-time constraints,
so we use DSA over ECDSA, but the impact of this choice
is minor because runtime is dominated by image processing.
Further, signature veriﬁcation can be done in parallel with
feature veriﬁcation and is not the performance bottleneck of
COUNTERFOIL.
5.3 Practicality and Costs
The COUNTERFOIL methodology is compatible as an add-
on to existing supply chains, and the cost at scale should be
signiﬁcantly less than one cent per chip. Chip veriﬁers can
use the inexpensive camera models from our experiments,
and perform processing on dedicated or shared computers.
Given that veriﬁcation would likely be performed at PCB
assembly houses, the small cost of the camera would be in-
signiﬁcant, especially when amortized over a large number
of boards being produced. The labels afﬁxed to the chips
cost $0.30 per sheet, and we print 1024 markers per sheet,
for a per-unit cost of $0.0003 per label. The enrolled data
for each chip is 1 MB, which at current hard-drive prices of
$0.03 per GB corresponds to a per-unit cost of $0.00003 for
storing the data. Afﬁxing markers to each chip is currently
a manual and time-consuming process. At scale we imag-
ine that per-chip labels could be replaced by labels on part
reels, or other ways of communicating a purported identity for

the parts that would be used to access the signed enrollment
records. In that case, the ROI would be identiﬁed based on
image recognition of package surface instead of the markers.
The low barriers to adoption of COUNTERFOIL are simply
having a packaging house deploy the technology, and estab-
lishing keys for signing and verifying chips. Even if only a
small fraction of purchasers would verify their chips using the
available information, this should increase the risk of detec-
tion for distributors that trafﬁc in possible counterfeits. The
more signiﬁcant barrier to adoption is perhaps the possibility
that superﬁcial cosmetic damage to parts could cause them to
become untrusted, representing a monetary loss and a harm
to branding.
Note that COUNTERFOIL is speciﬁcally targeted toward
preventing inauthentic parts from being installed onto printed
circuit boards of a system, and doing so without trusting dis-
tributors. The reliance on surface imaging makes the approach
less compatible with authentication by intermediate distrib-
utors between packaging and deployment. Distributors that
deal with parts in bulk will not ordinarily handle individual
chips in a way that is conducive to surface imaging for COUN-
TERFOIL.
5.4 Camera Differences
Because enrollment and veriﬁcation are performed using dif-
ferent camera instances, ability to match features may be
impacted by differences in the lens, lighting, or the sensor
array [34] of the cameras. To explore this further, we now
evaluate how the matching performance changes in the unre-
alistic scenario of using the same ViTiny camera instance for
both enrollment and veriﬁcation of AS6C6264 chips, which
was the most challenging authentication case in the prior ex-
periments (see Fig 9b). Fig. 11 shows that using a consistent
camera causes the number of inliers to increase, both in the
case of same-chip comparisons and same-mold comparisons.
The same-chip comparisons have a larger increase, and the
overlap between the two distributions is reduced, implying
capability for better authentication performance. This result
reveals the presence of some detrimental camera variations
that are being overcome in our realistic authentications that
use different camera instances for veriﬁcation and enrollment.
