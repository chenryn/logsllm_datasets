User: Please describe what is load balancing and commonly used load balancing algorithms.
Assistant: Load balancing refers to the technology of distributing network load to multiple servers to improve service reliability, performance and scalability. Commonly used load balancing algorithms include: 1. Round Robin: Assign requests to each server in turn to ensure that each server can be assigned a certain amount of requests, but the actual load of the server cannot be considered. 2. Random algorithm (Random): It is relatively simple to randomly distribute requests to servers, but it cannot consider the actual load of the server. 3. Least Connection Algorithm: Allocate requests to the server with the least number of connections, which can achieve the most load balancing, but cannot consider the actual load of the server such as CPU and memory. 4. IP hash algorithm (IP Hash): perform hash calculation based on the source IP address of the request, and send it to the server with the same hash value, which can balance the load, but cannot consider the actual load of the server. 5. Weighted Round Robin: The request is assigned to each server in turn, and different weights are assigned according to the load of the server, and the actual load of the server is considered during the allocation process. 6. Dynamic Weighted Round Robin: Dynamically adjust the weight according to the actual load of the server, which can balance the load more, but it needs to monitor the load of the server in real time.
