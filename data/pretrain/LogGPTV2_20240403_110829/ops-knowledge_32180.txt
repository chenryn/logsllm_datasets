User: I want to make a multi-threaded downloader (in Python) and I need to tell each thread where to start and how many bytes to download. For that I get the remote file size and divide it, for example, to 2. Now, let's say that the remote file size is 5: when I divide the number to 2, I get 2 as result. Now I can start the download but I will lose a byte (because 2*2=4, not 5). I can't use float numbers because I can't download half of a byte. How I could divide that number and to get a list with [2, 3], for example?
Assistant: Special case the last thread -- assign it to get however many bytes are left.
