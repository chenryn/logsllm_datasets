### Wi-Fi Devices and Epidemic Modeling

Wi-Fi devices can increase the spread of an epidemic by a factor of five, enabling the prediction of large-scale outbreaks. However, the short range of Bluetooth implies a slower, mobility-based spread. Cole et al. [25] use epidemic models and simulations to discuss requirements for worm mitigation in tactical battlefield MANETs. Stamm et al. [49] explore remote attacks on routers that can be used for large-scale pharming and viral spread. We also address pharming as one of the potential abuses of dense, weak Wi-Fi deployments, which can be exploited in a different way but to a similar extent.

### Probabilistic Queuing Model

Mickens and Noble [43] propose a framework called probabilistic queuing to model epidemic spreading in mobile environments, prioritizing node mobility. Their simulations show that the probabilistic queuing model can achieve more accurate predictions than the standard Kephart-White framework in many cases. However, this work assumes a random waypoint model for user movement and does not account for realistic user mobility patterns.

### Network Usage Analysis

Henderson et al. [33] analyzed extensive network traces from mature corporate WLANs and various university campuses, observing significant changes in wireless usage. These changes are favorable for the spread of a Wi-Fi worm. Users now run a wide variety of applications such as peer-to-peer, multimedia, and VoIP services, increasing the likelihood of exploitable vulnerabilities. Local traffic in the WLAN exceeds remote traffic, meaning users within the same organization exchange more data, which helps the worm detect and probe all wireless neighbors within its reach. The study also shows that wireless users are surprisingly non-mobile, with half remaining at home 98% of the time.

### User Association Patterns

In a similar approach, Hsu and Helmy [34] found that there is a preference in wireless user association: most users only visit a small portion of access points, and the ratio of visited access points remains relatively constant despite the increasing popularity of WLANs. There is a repetitive pattern of user association over days, quantified as a "network similarity index." This allows a mobile worm to self-activate when most mobile users are active, contrary to the general assumption that users are always online with no preference for association patterns. Additionally, a mobile node stays online on average 87.68% of its life, indicating a shift from temporary to always-on connections. Macro-mobility analysis shows that users have a small coverage area, typically associating with only 1.1% to 4.52% of total APs in their corporation.

### Hotspot Network Monitoring

Blinn et al. [21] monitored five weeks of Verizon Wi-Fi hotspot network in Manhattan, observing that more cards associated with the network than logged into it. Most clients used the network infrequently and visited only a few APs, suggesting that hotspots are "locations visited occasionally" rather than "primary places of work."

### Mobility Models

Kim et al. [37] extracted a mobility model from real user traces, finding that speed and pause time follow a log-normal distribution, and movement directions are closely related to road directions. Laptop clients are not very mobile, so the study relied on VoIP users to extract the mobility model. The type of mobile device influences user mobility: laptops tend to tie users to their workplace, while PDA/VoIP users move more freely. A mobility model for laptop users should reflect the relative weight of immobility and mobility.

### Internet Security Risks

Staniford et al. [51] describe the risk to the Internet due to the ability of attackers to quickly gain control of vast numbers of hosts. Controlling a million hosts can have catastrophic results, such as launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and accessing sensitive information. Their analysis shows how quickly attackers can compromise hosts using "dumb" worms and how "better" worms can spread even faster. In subsequent work [50], they show that a worm using pre-compiled lists of vulnerable IP addresses can infect one million hosts in half a second. They envision a Cyber "Center for Disease Control" (CCDC) for identifying outbreaks, analyzing pathogens, fighting infections, and devising methods to detect and resist future attacks. The metropolitan Wi-Fi environment offers another opportunity for attacks that may not be covered by defenses built for Internet worms.

### Location Privacy

The issue of location privacy in wireless settings has been examined in literature [35, 16, 31]. These systems focus on protecting physical location privacy against signal triangulation techniques and protecting source locations in sensor networks. Gruteser et al. [32] introduce the idea of short-lived disposable MAC addresses to reduce the effectiveness of location tracking. Our work shows that even with such techniques, user profiling can effectively track users in dense urban environments. Saponas et al. [47] describe a prototype surveillance system that can track people wearing widely available Nike+iPod sensors. Tracknets could be exploited in similar scenarios to track people carrying any type of device whose traffic can be observed by Wi-Fi receivers, such as Wi-Fi-enabled smartphones.

### Concluding Remarks

The increasing use of wireless technology, particularly Wi-Fi, is likely to attract the attention of attackers as they evolve and explore ways to exploit new technology. This paper discusses a range of modern threats specific to metro-area wireless networks, including wildfire worms, large-scale wireless spoofing attacks, and malicious Tracknets. Such threats are amplified by the dense deployment of Wi-Fi Access Points and the limited use of wireless security mechanisms like 802.11i. Our results suggest that the density of large metropolitan areas significantly impacts the severity of these threats.
