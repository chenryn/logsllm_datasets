Challenge Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var ourDecimal = 5.7;
    // Only change code below this line
    var myDecimal = 1.0;
The value 1.0 contains a decimal and is thus a floating point number, yet
fails the test case.
