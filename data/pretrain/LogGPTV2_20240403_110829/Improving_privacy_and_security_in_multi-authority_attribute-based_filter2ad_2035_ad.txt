To get the key, user u executes the following with each
authority k.
1. For j ∈ {1, . . . , N}\{k}, user u starts N − 1 indepen-
dent invocations of our anonymous key issuing proto-
col for g = yxk
, h = g1, αk = δkjRkj, βk = skj and
γk = δkj where Rkj ∈ Zq is randomly picked by au-
j
thority k and δkj = 1 if k > j and −1 otherwise. As a
Rkj
result, user u obtains Dkj = g
1 P RFkj(u) for k > j
or Dkj = g
/P RFkj(u) for k  N − 1.
The eﬃciency of our scheme compares favorably with that
of previous multi-authority ABE schemes, even though we
provide a stronger security guarantee.

{Tk,i}). This contrasts with the large universe model (ﬁrst
introduced in [13]), in which the universe of attributes is
exponentially large, but public parameter size depends on
a ﬁxed maximum on the number of attributes allowed in a
ciphertext. That approach also has the advantage that any
arbitrary string can be used as an attribute via the use of a
collision resistant hash function. A large universe construc-
tion was presented in [13] and a similar concept has been
used in [8].
Our anonymous key issuing protocol and the removal of
the central authority technique can also be applied to the
multi-authority version of the large universe and complex
access structure construction in [8]. We highlight ﬁve major
distinctions of the large universe construction:
1. Functions {Tk(i)} : Zq → G1 are used to replace the
group elements Tk,i for attribute i of each authority k.
Tk(i) is publicly computable.
2. Ck,i in the ciphertext is changed from T s
k,i to Tk(i)s.

While the proof of conﬁdentiality in [8] relies critically on the
construction of Tk(i) in the simulation, the key idea of the
multi-authority scheme in [5] is that p(0) will be set as the
PRF computed on the user’s GID, and thus this technique
is independent of how Tk(i) is constructed. As hinted at in
the intuition provided in the proof of our basic scheme, the
crux in our proof for multi-authority ABE is about how to
embed an unknown master secret key (which is related to
the solution of the hard problem) by taking advantage of the
pseudorandom values blinding the user secret key. We can
show security by applying the same techniques as in section
5. (Details of the proof are deferred to the full version.)
6.2 Complex Access Structure
Another limitation of our basic construction as described
in Section 5 is that it only supports simple dk-out-of-n thresh-
old policies, while Goyal et al.’s construction [8] supports a
tree access structure. When we consider the tree as a circuit,
the interior nodes consist of t-out-of-n gates for arbitrary
values of t and n, and each leaf node is associated with an
attribute and has value 1 if that attribute is present in a
given ciphertext.
This tree is the key idea behind the complex access struc-
ture construction. A polynomial px is chosen for each node
129vk −P
x in the tree. These polynomials are chosen in a top-down
manner, starting from the root node r, such that the de-
gree of the polynomial px is one less than the threshold
value tx of that node. The value pr(0) at the root node
depends on the AKeyGen algorithm. (In our case pr(0) =
j∈{1,...,N}\{k} Rkj.) For the other nodes x of the
tree, px(0) is deﬁned to be pparent[x](index[x]) where parent[x]
denotes the parent node of x and index[x] is merely a dis-
tinct number for each node at the same level. Using the
same approach as in [5], it is not diﬃcult to see that the
same tree-based key-structure can be used in our schemes,
simply by changing how the root key p(0) is generated.
6.3 Variable Thresholds across Authorities
Our basic construction requires the user to have enough
attributes from every authority, but we can easily let the
encryptor leave out a certain subset of authorities by ask-
ing each authority to issue to every user a decryption key
corresponding to dk dummy attributes.7
Generalizing, each encryptor can reduce the threshold for
a chosen set of authorities by adjusting the number of dummy
variables included for those authorities accordingly. Suppose
dmax is the maximum threshold. If the encryptor wanted
to require d(cid:48) < dmax of the attributes, he could encrypt
with respect to dmax − d(cid:48) dummy attributes in additional
to the usual attributes. This does not incur heavy penalty
in the eﬃciency of the system, especially when we have a
large universe construction to host the dummy attributes.
The use of dummy variables for ﬂexible threshold policy
in the ciphertext was suggested in [5]. We note that our
scheme also allows ﬂexibility in setting the threshold policy
in the key, simply due to the fact that our scheme supports
diﬀerent threshold values dk for diﬀerent users.
7. CONCLUSION
It is unrealistic to assume there is a single authority which
can monitor every single attribute of all users. Multi-authority
attribute-based encryption enables a more realistic deploy-
ment of attribute-based access control, such that diﬀerent
authorities are responsible for issuing diﬀerent sets of at-
tributes. The original solution by Chase employs a trusted
central authority and the use of a global identiﬁer for each
user, which means the conﬁdentiality depends critically on
the security of the central authority and the user-privacy
depends on the honest behavior of the attribute-authorities.
We propose an attribute-based encryption scheme without
the trusted authority, and an anonymous key issuing proto-
col which works for both existing schemes and for our new
construction. We hope that our work gives a more practice-
oriented attribute based encryption system.

7In contrast to a normal threshold cryptosystem, here the
threshold will only be reduced if the encryptor chooses to
do so (by including dummy attributes in the ciphertext at-
tribute set). Thus, each ciphertext may have a diﬀerent
threshold.
