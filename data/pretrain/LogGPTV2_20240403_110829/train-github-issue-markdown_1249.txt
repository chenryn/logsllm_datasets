With r111, WebGlRenderer begins checking for a position buffer attribute and
uses its count in deciding whether to invoke the program. This introduced an
arbitrary new requirement that BufferGeometry have a 'position' attribute. I
suggest that the old behavior be followed, in which
BufferGeometry.setDrawRange() is respected.
WebGLRenderer.js:
    var position = geometry.attributes.position;
    if ( index !== null && index.count === 0 ) return;
    if ( position === undefined || position.count === 0 ) return;
