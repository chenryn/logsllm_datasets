**Abstract:**
Smartwatches provide access to a wide range of private information, but the security and usability of existing screen lock mechanisms are not well understood. Prior studies suggest that standard authentication methods, such as 4-digit PINs, are challenging and error-prone on smartwatches due to their small button sizes. To address this, we conducted interviews with smartwatch users, revealing that they find the ten-key keypad difficult to use. We propose the Personal Identification Chord (PIC), an authentication system based on a four-button chorded keypad, allowing users to enter ten different inputs via taps on one or two larger buttons. Two studies assessing the usability and security of PIC indicate that while it increases setup and recall time, it can be entered accurately with high recall rates and may improve guessing entropy compared to PINs.

## 1. Introduction

Smartwatches are rapidly evolving into powerful standalone computing devices, integrating technologies such as voice assistants, eSIM cards, phone connections, and financial transaction capabilities. They store and present a broad spectrum of personal information, often mediated through features like Google's proximity-based Smart Lock. However, the small input spaces on smartwatches can discourage users from securing their devices. Usability studies report optimal error rates for PIN entry between 7.5% and 11%, which can be a barrier to adoption. Additionally, PIN entry interfaces typically require explicit commands, occupy the entire watch face, and obstruct core functions like viewing the time. This paper argues that current smartwatch authentication techniques, such as PINs, are poorly suited to the combination of small screens and users' finger sizes. 

To address these issues, we conducted an interview study (N = 10) with smartwatch owners to understand usability concerns. We then designed the Personal Identification Chord (PIC), a novel authentication interface based on four large buttons and chorded input. We also conducted a keypress-level usability study (N = 21) and a comprehensive two-day study (N = 120) to evaluate the security and usability of PIC and PINs. Our results indicate that while PIC increases setup and recall times, it provides more accurate input, especially in non-optimal conditions, and may offer better resistance to guessing attacks.

## 2. First Study: Identifying Design Requirements

### 2.1 Methodology
We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten smartwatch users at a large IT company. Participants were asked to enable and use the screen lock feature, and to note their daily routines related to wearing and removing their watches. The interviews covered their experiences and opinions about the screen lock mechanisms, focusing on usability and potential improvements. Participants were compensated with retail vouchers worth approximately ten USD.

### 2.2 Results
Participants were aged 29 to 37, with a mean age of 33, all right-handed and from diverse backgrounds. Most wore their watches on their left wrists. Only two participants used 4-digit PINs, with one deactivating the feature due to frequent locking. Participants reported donning their watches one to four times a day. The analysis of interview responses revealed clear usability issues, with eight out of ten participants citing "small button" sizes and three mentioning "small screen" sizes. This led to our first design requirement:

**Requirement 1:** Smartwatch screen lock user interfaces should have buttons larger than those of existing PIN keypads.

Additionally, participants suggested biometric approaches (fingerprint and vein) and eyes-free/GUI-free unlocking. These recommendations stemmed from a desire for greater convenience and ease during PIN entry. This led to our second design requirement:

**Requirement 2:** Smartwatch screen locks should work under eyes-free and GUI-free conditions.

## 3. Personal Identification Chord (PIC) Scheme Design

To meet these requirements, we propose the Personal Identification Chord (PIC), a novel input scheme for smartwatch authentication. PIC aims to:
1. Reduce the number of on-screen targets, enabling larger, more easily selectable buttons.
2. Work without a dedicated GUI, eliminating the need for a UI event to summon the authentication screen.
3. Maintain the password space and resistance to brute force attacks by enabling multiple simultaneous selections, similar to a chorded keyboard.

PIC presents four equally sized targets labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, replacing the 10 buttons in a numeric keypad. In addition to single-tap selections, PIC allows all six possible dual-tap selections, providing ten separate input symbols. A PIC is composed of a sequence of four (single or dual) taps, yielding 10,000 possible options. The ultimate goal is to encourage the use of authentication on small wearables by making systems more approachable, reliable, and efficient while maintaining security.

PIC was implemented on a Sony Smartwatch 3 using the Processing programming language. The device features a 30mm square multi-touch capacitive touch screen, enabling the detection of two simultaneous taps. For vertically aligned pairs of keys, a single touch covering both targets was incorporated. The top 20% of the screen is reserved for feedback and instructional elements, and 0.6mm spaces between keys facilitate accurate selection. The size of each PIC key is 157 pixels wide (14.7mm) by 125 pixels high (11.7mm).

To implement the touch sensing functionality, we modified the Android kernel to capture and process raw sensor data, following the approach of several authors designing novel touch interfaces. We adapted an open-source implementation to clean up raw data and create a clear and accurate touch image. Touches were classified based on centroid, orientation, and axis length, with specific thresholds derived through experimentation.

## 4. Second Study: Individual Tap Usability

We conducted an initial study to assess the usability of PIC taps on a smartwatch, comparing them to a standard numeric PIN and in a GUI-free setting. The study involved a keypress-level usability test (N = 21) and a comprehensive two-day study (N = 120) to evaluate the security and usability of PIC and PINs. The results indicate that while PIC increases setup and recall times, it provides more accurate input, especially in non-optimal conditions, and may offer better resistance to guessing attacks.
