ABSTRACT
Smartwatches support access to a wide range of private information
but little is known about the security and usability of existing
smartwatch screen lock mechanisms. Prior studies suggest that
smartwatch authentication via standard techniques such as 4-digit
PINs is challenging and error-prone. We conducted interviews to
shed light on current practices, revealing that smartwatch users
consider the ten-key keypad required for PIN entry to be hard to use
due to its small button sizes. To address this issue, we propose the
Personal Identification Chord (PIC), an authentication system based
on a four-button chorded keypad that enables users to enter ten
different inputs via taps to one or two larger buttons. Two studies
assessing usability and security of our technique indicate PICs lead
to increases in setup and (modestly) recall time, but can be entered
accurately while maintaining high recall rates and may improve
guessing entropy compared to PINs.

make financial transactions [18] and advanced fitness monitoring.
They store, present and, through technologies such as Google’s
proximity-based Smart Lock [11], mediate access to a broad spec-
trum of personal information. However, recent literature suggests
that the diminutive input spaces on smartwatches may dissuade
users from securing their devices: usability studies of PIN entry
report optimal error rates of between 7.5% [25] and 11% [35], which
we argue is sufficient to represent a barrier to adoption. In addition,
smartwatch PIN entry interfaces suffer from further disincentives:
they typically need to be summoned with an explicit command
and then occupy the entire surface of a smartwatch – first further
adding to entry times, requiring users to pay careful attention to
the smartwatch face immediately after donning their smartwatches,
and then obstructing core device functions, such as viewing the
time. In this way, authentication techniques such as LG’s Knock
Code [30] that are designed to be used without a Graphical User
Interface (GUI), may be a better fit to the smartwatch form factor.
This paper argues that current smartwatch authentication tech-
niques, such as PIN, are a relatively poor fit for the combination of

users’ fat fingers [29] and the form factor’s inherently small screens.
PIN buttons are small and hard to hit, issues that may affect both
performance in entry tasks [34], and impact the adoption rate of
authentication systems [27]. This paper explores this issue in four
ways. Firstly, to better understand those usability issues, we con-
ducted an interview study (N = 10) with current watch owners.
Secondly, to mitigate the concerns they raised, we designed the
Personal Information Chord (PIC), a novel authentication inter-
face for smartwatches based on four large buttons and chorded
input. Thirdly, to understand input performance on smartwatches,
we characterized and compared performance with standard PIN
against PIC input in a simple single session keypress-level usability
study (N = 21). Fourthly, to evaluate the security and usability of
PIC and PIN as authentication mechanisms, we conducted a com-
prehensive two-day study in which participants were required to
create and recall their own PINs/PICs (N = 120).
The results from the interview study indicate that smartwatch
users are generally concerned with entering four digit PINs on
small watch screens using small buttons, and prefer a GUI free
interface for unlocking their watches. Data from the usability study
indicate these concerns may be overstated: during standard input,
PIN entry is rapid (0.75s) and accurate (1.34% errors). During a
more challenging input condition with the GUI obscured, PIN in-
put error rates increase to 9.05% suggesting that authentication
in non-optimal input scenarios (e.g. while mobile, distracted) may
be more problematic. Performance with PIC, designed to mitigate
such problems, is modestly slower than PIN in standard input (by
0.13s), while achieving lower error rates compared to PIN in the
more challenging GUI free input condition (errors are stable at
between 5.0% and 5.5% in both GUI and GUI free conditions). Re-
sults from the final study flesh out these assertions. In terms of
usability, PIC setup requires longer than PIN setup (by 12-34s) and,
when using a standard UI, PIC entry is marginally slower than PIN
entry (0.4-1.4s). Recall rates (97-100%) are high for both schemes. In
terms of security, PICs provide a modest increase in partial guess-
ing entropy over PINs. Furthermore, 50% of PIN participants used
personal information (e.g., birthdays) to select memorable PINs, a
behavior that the non-numeric structure of PIC precluded. Based
on these outcomes, we suggest that while the costs of using PIC
are increases in setup and, more modestly, recall time, the benefits
it brings to non-optimal input settings (reduced error rates) and
potential increases in resistance to guessing attacks makes it an
interesting and viable alternative to PIN for smartwatches.
In sum, this paper makes the following contributions: 1) an
interview study (N = 10) capturing usability issues with existing
smartwatch screen lock GUIs; 2) PICs, a novel authentication input
technique explicitly designed to include large targets that better
fit the smartwatch form factor; 3) a keypress level study (N = 21)
of PINs and PICs; 4) a multi-session PIN/PIC recall study (N = 120)
capturing metrics such as setup time, recall time, recall rate and
reporting an in-depth security analysis of the generated PINs/PICs
with respect to guessing entropy.
2 FIRST STUDY: IDENTIFYING DESIGN
REQUIREMENTS
We conducted an interview study with existing smartwatch users
focusing on screen lock experiences, in order to derive design re-
quirements in this space.
2.1 Methodology
The semi-structured interview was conducted at a large IT company
with ten current smartwatch users. It involved an exercise: if screen
lock was not enabled, participants enabled it. They were then asked
to remove their smartwatches, wait a few minutes, then put them
back on, and authenticate – smartwatches typically only require
authentication when donned. This activity ensured some baseline
experience with smartwatch lock screens. We also asked them to
note down their daily routines, as relating to taking off and putting
on their smartwatches. The remainder of the interview covered
smartwatch locking behaviors and perceptions, and participants’
opinions about the screen lock mechanisms on their smartwatches
in terms of usability and how they could be improved. Participants
were compensated with retail vouchers worth about ten USD.
2.2 Results
Participants were aged between 29 and 37, with a mean of 33,
all Asian and right handed and from diverse backgrounds: arts,
engineering, computers and architecture. All wore their watch
on their left wrists. Six participants used Samsung Gear S2, one
participant Samsung Gear S3, and three participants the Apple
Watch Series 1 (two were using the smaller Apple Watch). Only
two participants (both with Apple Watch) were using 4-digit PINs
to lock their screens. The remaining Apple Watch participant had
previously used it (for about a year) but deactivated the feature
because it locked the screen too frequently. PIN was the only screen
lock option available on all smartwatches in the study. Participants
also reported donning their smartwatches between one and four
times a day. One participant reported that he or she puts on the
watch once in the morning around 7 before going to work, and
takes it off just once at night around 9 when he or she returns home.
This routine of putting on the watch just once per day was the
longest (approximately 24 hour) interval between donning routines
reported in the study.
Two researchers used open coding to analyze interview responses
separately then discussed and reviewed all codes until they reached
consensus. There were a number of very clear usability responses:
eight out of ten participants raised issues with “small button” sizes,
and three participants echoed this with concerns about “small
screen” sizes. The prominence of these codes leads to our first
design requirement:
Requirement 1: Smartwatch screen lock user inter-
faces should be designed with buttons larger than
those of existing PIN keypads.
In terms of usability enhancements, bio-metric approaches were
frequently suggested: fingerprint (four participants) or vein (two).
Two participants mentioned that they would like to unlock without
looking at their watch screens (eyes-free [7]), and two suggested
that unlocking should not require a GUI (GUI-free). Motivations for
The Personal Identification Chord

these recommendations stemmed from a wish for greater conve-
nience and ease during PIN entry: a desire to unlock while walking
or otherwise mobile, and a sense that existing numerical keypads
are a poor fit for small watch screens. We derived our second design
requirement from these comments:
Requirement 2: Smartwatch screen locks should be
designed to work under eyes-free and GUI-free con-
ditions.
3 PERSONAL INFORMATION CHORD
SCHEME DESIGN
To fulfill these requirements, we propose the Personal Identifica-
tion Chord (or PIC), a novel input scheme for authentication on
smartwatches. It is designed to achieve three objectives. Firstly,
to reduce the number of on-screen targets presented to users. In
this way, the targets can be enlarged (Requirement 1), facilitating
selection. Secondly, to be used without a dedicated GUI to remove
the need for a UI event to summon an authentication input screen
that then obscures core content such as a watch-face (Requirement
2). This approach mirrors techniques such as LG’s Knock Code for
smartphones [30]. This is a specialized input technique designed to
support rapid unlocking when the device deactivated or in sleep
mode. Thirdly, to maintain the password space and resistance to
brute force attack of a standard PIN by enabling multiple simul-
taneous selections, as in a chorded keyboard. PIC realizes these
objectives by presenting four equally sized targets labelled one, two,
three and four in the space reserved for the 10 buttons in a numeric
keypad. In addition to single-tap selections of the four individual
keys, PIC enables all six possible dual-tap selections of pairs of keys
for a total of ten separate input symbols. The set of dual-taps is
illustrated on a smartwatch in Figure 1. As with a standard PIN, a
PIC is composed of a sequence of four (single or dual) taps, yielding
10,000 possible options. The ultimate design goal for PICs is to
encourage the use of authentication on small wearables such as
smartwatches by making systems more approachable, reliable, and
efficient while maintaining security.
PICs were implemented on a Sony Smartwatch 3 using the Pro-
cessing programming language. This device features a 30mm square
multi-touch capable capacitive touch screen, natively enabling de-
tection of two simultaneous taps. However, some dual-taps, specif-
ically those requiring touches to a pair of vertically aligned keys
(i.e., 1+3 and 2+4) are challenging to achieve with a pair of touches
– for example, to align the index and middle finger vertically on
the screen requires an awkward rotation of the wrist. To facilitate
these inputs, we also incorporated the ability to select a pair of
targets with a single touch that covers them both. For vertically
aligned pairs of keys, this takes the form of a finger laid flat on
the left or right side of the watch, as illustrated in Figure 1. Our
PIC implementation also devotes the top 20% (6mm) of the screen
to feedback and/or instructional interface elements, and facilitates
accurate selection with small 0.6mm spaces between keys. The ulti-
mate size of the four PIC keys is 157 pixels wide (14.7mm) by 125
pixels high (11.7mm).
To implement the touch sensing functionality required for PICs,
we modified the Android kernel to capture and process the raw

sensor data from the touch screen, an approach followed by numer-
ous authors seeking to design novel touch interfaces [17, 33]. We
then manually generated all touch events in the system. Specifically,
we adapted the open source implementation introduced in Gil et
al. [10]. The data provided by this approach is an intensity map
of touch activations over the whole sensor area: a seven by seven
grid for the Sony Smartwatch 3. Through continuous testing during
development we determined an appropriate process to clean up the
raw data and create a clear and accurate touch image. We used a
threshold to exclude data of less than 30% of the maximum sensor
reading and applied a log gamma correction to the remainder. We
then processed each touch through a combination of flood-filling to
identify separate touches followed by calculating image moments to
identify the key properties of centroid, orientation and major/minor
axis length (as in [33]). We excluded touches where we were unable
to derive lengths for both major and minor axes and considered the
temporally central point of each touch in order to generate selec-
tions. We classified touches as selecting the vertically aligned keys
of 1+3 and 2+4 when they satisfied three conditions. Firstly, a cen-
troid in the left (1+3) or right (1+4) portion of the screen. Secondly,
a major axis length exceeding 53.6% of the touch screen, equivalent
to covering 3.75 of the seven sensors or 16.2mm of real space. Fi-
nally, the angle of the touch had to be ±20 degrees from vertical.
These thresholds were derived through subjective experimentation.
We processed all other touches based solely on their centroid. The
system ran at approximately 80 samples per second, rapid enough
to support fluid touch input and our empirical objectives.
4 SECOND STUDY: INDIVIDUAL TAP
USABILITY
We conducted an initial study to assess usability of the PIC taps
on a smartwatch against the baseline of a standard numeric PIN
and in an GUI-free setting in which graphical representations of
