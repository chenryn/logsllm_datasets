Setting atom as git editor on windows 7 works when I dont have an instance of
atom running
    > git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
But when I am editing a file in atom and do a commit, I get below message even
though the commit message tmp file opens in a new tab in current atom window.
    > git commit
    Aborting commit due to empty commit message.
