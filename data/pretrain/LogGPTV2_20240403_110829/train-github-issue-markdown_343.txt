It appears that commit `329a5cf` has introduced a bug in the `_basic_auth_str` function, causing it to raise a `TypeError` when the provided username and password are `None`. Prior to this commit, in requests version 2.1.1, it was permissible to pass `None` values for the username and password when authentication was optional. This was particularly useful in scenarios such as Home Assistant writing to InfluxDB with the default configuration.

The exception raised is as follows:
```
TypeError: sequence item 0: expected a bytes-like object, NoneType found
```
