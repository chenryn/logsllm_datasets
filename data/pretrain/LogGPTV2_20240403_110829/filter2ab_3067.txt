title:blackhat:asia-21 X-in-the-Middle: Attacking Fast Charging Piles and Electric Vehicles 
Electric vehicles represented by Tesla are changing the way people travel. How to safely and quickly charge electric vehicles is a problem that manufacturers of electric vehicles and charging piles need to solve. We conducted an in-depth analysis of the security of the DC fast charging communication protocol and found many interesting findings. This talk will mainly be divided into three parts. First, we will introduce the current global mainstream fast charging standards and communication protocols.  Next, we will share how to build an X-in-the-Middle attack environment. We have written a security test tool called "XCharger", and it can be used to capture, modify, replay, and fuzz the data packets in the communication process. Finally, we will share how to use our tools to analyze the private charging pile agreement of a well-known electric vehicle manufacturer, and to exploit the protocol vulnerability of DC fast charging pile to achieve free charging, and to change the charging voltage and current limits.
