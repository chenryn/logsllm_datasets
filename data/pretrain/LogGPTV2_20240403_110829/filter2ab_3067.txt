### Title: BlackHat Asia 2021 - X-in-the-Middle: Attacking Fast Charging Piles and Electric Vehicles

Electric vehicles, exemplified by Tesla, are revolutionizing the way people travel. Ensuring the safe and efficient charging of these vehicles is a critical challenge for both vehicle manufacturers and charging infrastructure providers. In our research, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the security of DC fast charging communication protocols and uncovered several significant findings.

This presentation will be divided into three main sections:

1. **Overview of Global Fast Charging Standards and Protocols:**
   We will begin by providing an overview of the current global mainstream fast charging standards and communication protocols. This section will cover the key specifications and their intended use cases.

2. **Building an X-in-the-Middle (XitM) Attack Environment:**
   Next, we will share our methodology for creating an X-in-the-Middle attack environment. We have developed a security testing tool called "XCharger," which allows us to capture, modify, replay, and fuzz data packets during the communication process between electric vehicles and charging stations.

3. **Exploiting Protocol Vulnerabilities:**
   Finally, we will demonstrate how to use our tools to analyze the proprietary charging protocol of a well-known electric vehicle manufacturer. We will show how to exploit vulnerabilities in the DC fast charging protocol to achieve unauthorized free charging and manipulate the charging voltage and current limits.

By the end of this talk, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the security challenges associated with DC fast charging and the potential risks that need to be addressed to ensure the safety and reliability of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
