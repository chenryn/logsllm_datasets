## Abstract
The increasing reliance on networked applications for timely and reliable data transfer necessitates that the underlying networking infrastructure provides adequate services even in the presence of persistent failures, such as broken links or routers. Achieving this requirement is particularly challenging for multicast sessions, where a single failure can disrupt service to multiple receivers simultaneously. This paper introduces the Survivable Multicast Routing Protocol (SMRP), which facilitates fast recovery of multicast sessions in the face of persistent failures by leveraging local detour paths. Our evaluation results demonstrate that SMRP trades off end-to-end delay and resource usage for shorter and faster recovery paths. For instance, under specific parameter values, SMRP reduces the recovery path length by 20% with only a 5% increase in end-to-end delay and resource usage. Additionally, several design enhancements have been implemented to make SMRP efficient, robust, flexible, and scalable.

## 1. Introduction
Service providers are increasingly offering new revenue-generating services with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Unlike traditional datagram services, these services impose stringent QoS requirements in terms of packet delivery delay, jitter, error rate, and more. It is essential for providers to maintain an adequate level of service even in the presence of persistent network failures, which can last for hours due to various causes such as accidental cable cuts, hardware malfunctions, power outages, software errors, natural disasters, and human errors. 

Network failures are more destructive for multicast communication than for unicast. In multicast, data packets are delivered through a tree topology, and a single link or node failure can simultaneously disconnect multiple receivers. Traditional multicast routing protocols, such as PIM, require a lengthy process to reconstruct the multicast tree, leading to significant service disruptions. Recent studies have shown that the recovery time for PIM-based multicast sessions is dominated by the underlying unicast protocol's recovery process. However, our study indicates that faster service restoration can be achieved by quickly identifying local detour paths instead of waiting for full routing re-stabilization.

For example, consider the multicast tree in Figure 1(a). If the on-tree link LAD fails, node D is disconnected and attempts to recover by locating a new non-faulty path. Existing protocols like PIM select the shortest path from D to the source S, resulting in a new path D → B → S. An alternative path D → C → A → S, while incurring a larger end-to-end delay, has a shorter recovery path and thus speeds up the recovery process. By utilizing non-faulty on-tree neighbor nodes, the service restoration latency decreases.

In current multicast routing schemes, each link/node on the delivery tree is shared by as many members as possible to minimize the tree cost. When a commonly shared link/node fails, it is less likely for a member to receive assistance from its neighbors for recovery. To mitigate this, we propose a new tree structure in which paths are disjoint, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous disconnections and enabling faster recovery.

In this paper, we introduce the Survivable Multicast Routing Protocol (SMRP), which builds a multicast tree with less path sharing to increase the likelihood of disrupted members restoring their service with the assistance of on-tree neighbors. This approach trades off optimal end-to-end delay and tree cost for better fault-tolerance. In one simulation, SMRP achieves an average of 20% shorter recovery paths at the expense of a 5% increase in end-to-end delay or tree cost. By introducing a configurable parameter \( D_{\text{thresh}} \), SMRP can adaptively balance recovery latency and transmission efficiency.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes related work on fault-tolerant multicast. Section 3 formulates the problem and proposes the new multicast routing protocol. Section 4 evaluates the proposed technique via in-depth simulations. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work
Fault-tolerance in networks can be achieved reactively or proactively. Reactive approaches construct replacement paths upon failure, which can be time-consuming. Proactive approaches, such as the dependable real-time connection proposed by Han and Shin, use primary and backup channels to ensure fast recovery. In multicast, Medard et al. developed an algorithm to construct two multicast trees, ensuring continuity in the face of a single failure. However, the complexity of this approach makes it impractical for large networks.

Reliable multicast protocols, such as those using local recovery and gossip-based mechanisms, have been proposed to handle infrequent, transient packet losses. These mechanisms are inefficient for persistent failures, especially for applications with stringent QoS requirements.

This paper focuses on efficient restoration of multicast services from persistent network failures, an area not well addressed in the literature. We adopt the idea of local recovery to accelerate the recovery process and devise a new multicast routing protocol that can adaptively adjust the tree structure to balance transmission efficiency and service recovery latency.

## 3. The Proposed Multicast Routing Protocol
### 3.1 Problem Formulation and Design Goals
There is a growing need for communication services with guaranteed fault-tolerance in multicast QoS-sensitive applications such as video conferencing, remote monitoring, and medical services. These applications have stringent QoS requirements and cannot tolerate large service restoration latencies. While reliable multicast protocols exist, they are primarily designed for transient packet losses and are inadequate for persistent failures.

Our goal is to design a scheme that enhances multicast applications with the required fault-tolerance. In our service recovery architecture, the restoration path selected by each disconnected multicast receiver should:
1. Avoid faulty links/nodes.
2. Utilize a non-faulty local neighbor’s on-tree path to reduce the length of the recovery path.

As shown in Figure 1, when D attempts to recover from the failure of link LAD, two detour paths are available. Path D → B → S is shorter in terms of end-to-end delay but requires a longer recovery path. Path D → C → A → S, while incurring a larger end-to-end delay, has a shorter recovery path and is preferred for fault-tolerance. We define a new metric, Recovery Distance Ratio (RDR), which represents the length of the restoration path. For example, if D chooses D → C → A → S, the restoration path is D → C, and RDR_D = 2.

The key to local recovery via an on-tree neighbor node is that the node is not affected by the current network failure. Current multicast routing protocols, based on SPF or cost-minimizing algorithms, often result in shared sub-paths among neighboring nodes, making it difficult to find a connected neighbor for recovery. To address this, we propose the Survivable Multicast Routing Protocol (SMRP), which constructs the multicast tree to reduce the likelihood of simultaneous disconnections.

To increase the chance of finding a neighbor whose multicast path is disjoint from the faulty segment, SMRP constructs the multicast tree with less link/node sharing among members' paths. Specifically, we define a new metric, SHRS,R, which measures the degree of link/node sharing along the on-tree path between the source S and node R. This metric is calculated as:

\[ \text{SHRS,R} = \sum_{\text{all } L_{i,j} \subset PT(S,R)} N_{L_{i,j}} \]

where \( PT(S,R) \) is the on-tree path between S and R, and \( N_{L_{i,j}} \) is the number of multicast members whose paths include link \( L_{i,j} \). The larger the value of \( N_{L_{i,j}} \), the more multicast members share the link. For example, in Figure 1(a), \( \text{SHRS,C} = N_{LS,A} + N_{LA,C} = 2 + 1 = 3 \).

When a new receiver joins the multicast group, it selects a multicast path via the least shared link, subject to certain constraints. This approach ensures that the multicast tree is constructed to reduce the likelihood of simultaneous disconnections and facilitate faster recovery.
