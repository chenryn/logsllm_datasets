ABSTRACT
The distribution of videos over the Internet is drastically
transforming how media is consumed and monetized. Con-
tent providers, such as media outlets and video subscrip-
tion services, would like to ensure that their videos do not
fail, startup quickly, and play without interruptions. In re-
turn for their investment in video stream quality, content
providers expect less viewer abandonment, more viewer en-
gagement, and a greater fraction of repeat viewers, resulting
in greater revenues. The key question for a content provider
or a CDN is whether and to what extent changes in video
quality can cause changes in viewer behavior. Our work
is the ﬁrst to establish a causal relationship between video
quality and viewer behavior, taking a step beyond purely
correlational studies. To establish causality, we use Quasi-
Experimental Designs, a novel technique adapted from the
medical and social sciences.
We study the impact of video stream quality on viewer
behavior in a scientiﬁc data-driven manner by using exten-
sive traces from Akamai’s streaming network that include
23 million views from 6.7 million unique viewers. We show
that viewers start to abandon a video if it takes more than 2
seconds to start up, with each incremental delay of 1 second
resulting in a 5.8% increase in the abandonment rate. Fur-
ther, we show that a moderate amount of interruptions can
decrease the average play time of a viewer by a signiﬁcant
amount. A viewer who experiences a rebuﬀer delay equal to
1% of the video duration plays 5% less of the video in com-
parison to a similar viewer who experienced no rebuﬀering.
Finally, we show that a viewer who experienced failure is
2.32% less likely to revisit the same site within a week than
a similar viewer who did not experience a failure.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet is radically transforming all aspects of human
society by enabling a wide range of applications for business,
commerce, entertainment, news and social networking. Per-
haps no industry has been transformed more radically than
the media and entertainment segment of the economy. As
media such as television and movies migrate to the Internet,
there are twin challenges that content providers face whose
ranks include major media companies (e.g., NBC, CBS),
news outlets (e.g., CNN), sports organizations (e.g., NFL,
MLB), and video subscription services (e.g., Netﬂix, Hulu).
The ﬁrst major challenge for content providers is pro-
viding a high-quality streaming experience for their view-
ers, where videos are available without failure, they startup
quickly, and stream without interruptions [24]. A major
technological innovation of the past decade that allows con-
tent providers to deliver higher-quality video streams to a
global audience of viewers is the content delivery network
(or, CDN for short) [8, 17]. CDNs are large distributed sys-
tems that consist of hundreds of thousands of servers placed
in thousands of ISPs close to end users. CDNs employ sev-
eral techniques for transporting [2, 12] media content from
the content provider’s origin to servers at the “edges” of the
Internet where they are cached and served with higher qual-
ity to the end user. (See [17] for a more detailed description
of a typical CDN architecture.)
The second major challenge of a content provider is to
actually monetize their video content through ad-based or
subscription-based models. Content providers track key met-
rics of viewer behavior that lead to better monetization.
Primary among them relate to viewer abandonment, engage-
ment, and repeat viewership. Content providers know that
reducing the abandonment rate, increasing the play time of
each video watched, and enhancing the rate at which view-
ers return to their site increase opportunities for advertising
and upselling, leading to greater revenues. The key ques-
tion is whether and by how much increased stream quality
can cause changes in viewer behavior that are conducive to
improved monetization. Relatively little is known from a
scientiﬁc standpoint about the all-important causal link be-
tween video stream quality and viewer behavior for online
media. Exploring the causal impact of quality on behavior
211and developing tools for such an exploration are the primary
foci of our work.
While understanding the link between stream quality and
viewer behavior is of paramount importance to the content
provider, it also has profound implications for how a CDN
must be architected. An architect is often faced with trade-
oﬀs on which quality metrics need to be optimized by the
CDN. A scientiﬁc study of which quality metrics have the
most impact on viewer behavior can guide these choices.
As an example of viewer behavior impacting CDN archi-
tecture, we performed small-scale controlled experiments on
viewer behavior a decade ago that established the relative
importance of the video to startup quickly and play without
interruptions. These behavioral studies motivated an archi-
tectural feature called prebursting [12] that was deployed
on Akamai’s live streaming network that enabled the CDN
to deliver streams to a media player at higher than the en-
coded rate for short periods of time to ﬁll the media player’s
buﬀer with more data more quickly, resulting in the stream
starting up faster and playing with fewer interruptions. It
is notable that the folklore on the importance of startup
time and rebuﬀering were conﬁrmed in two recent impor-
tant large-scale scientiﬁc studies [9, 15]. Our current work
sheds further light on the important nexus between stream
quality and viewer behavior and, importantly, provides the
ﬁrst evidence of a causal impact of quality on behavior.
1.1 Measuring quality and viewer behavior
The advent of customizable media players supporting ma-
jor formats such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and
Apple HTTP streaming has revolutionized our ability to per-
form truly large-scale studies of stream quality and viewer
behavior as we do in this work, in a way not possible even a
few years ago. It has become possible to instrument media
players with an analytics plug-in that accurately measures
and reports both quality and behavioral metrics from every
viewer on a truly planetary scale.
1.2 From correlation to causality
The ability to measure stream quality and viewer behavior
on a global scale allows us to correlate the two in a statis-
tically signiﬁcant way. For each video watched by a viewer,
we are able to measure its quality including whether the
stream was available, how long the stream took to start up,
and how much rebuﬀerring occurred causing interruptions.
We are also able to measure the viewer’s behavior including
whether he/she abandoned the video and how long he/she
watched the video.
As a ﬁrst step, we begin by simply correlating important
quality metrics experienced by the viewers to the behavior
that they exhibit. For instance, we discover a strong cor-
relation between an increase in the delay for the video to
start up and an increase in rate at which viewers abandon
the video. Several of our results are the ﬁrst quantitative
demonstration that certain key streaming quality metrics
are correlated with key behavioral metrics of the viewer.
However, the deeper question is not just whether quality
and behavior are correlated but whether quality can causally
impact viewer behavior. While correlation is an important
ﬁrst step, correlation does not necessarily imply causality.
The holy grail of a content provider or a CDN architect is
to discover causal relationships rather than just correlational
ones, since they would like to know with some certainty that
the signiﬁcant eﬀort expended in improving stream quality
will in fact result in favorable viewer behavior.
In fact, a purely correlational relationship could even lead
one astray, if there is no convincing evidence of causality,
leading to poor business decisions. For instance, both video
quality (say, video bitrates) and viewer behavior (say, play
time) have been steadily improving over the past decade
and are hence correlated in a statistical sense. But, that
fact alone is not suﬃcient to conclude that higher bitrates
cause viewers to watch longer, unless one can account for
other potential “confounding” factors such as the available
video content itself becoming more captivating over time.
While inferring causality is generally diﬃcult, a key tool
widely used in the social and medical sciences to infer causal-
ity from observational data is a Quasi Experimental Design
(QED) [23].
Intuitively, a QED is constructed to infer if
a particular “treatment” (i.e., cause) results in a particular
“outcome” (i.e., eﬀect) by pairing each person in the observa-
tional data who has had treatment with a random untreated
person who is “signiﬁcantly identical” to the treated person
in all other respects. Thus, the pairing eliminates the ef-
fect of the hidden confounding variables by ensuring that
both members of a pair have suﬃciently identical values for
those variables. Thus, evaluating the diﬀerential outcomes
between treated and untreated pairs can either strengthen
or weaken a causal conclusion that the treatment causally
impacts the outcome. While it is impossible to completely
eliminate all hidden factors, our causal analysis using QEDs
should be viewed as strengthening our correlational observa-
tions between treatments and outcomes by eliminating the
common threats to a causal conclusion.
1.3 Our Contributions
Our study is one of the largest of its kind of video stream
quality and viewer behavior that collects and analyzes a data
set consisting of more than 23 million video playbacks from
6.7 million unique viewers who watched an aggregate of 216
million minutes of 102 thousand videos over 10 days.
To our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to provide evidence
that video stream quality causally impacts viewer behavior,
a conclusion that is important to both content providers
and CDNs. Further, our adaptation of Quasi-Experimental
Designs (QEDs) is an unique contribution and is of indepen-
dent interest. QEDs have been used extensively in medical
research and the social sciences in the past decades. We ex-
pect that our adaptation of QEDs for measurement research
in networked systems could be key in a variety of other do-
mains that have so far been limited to correlational studies.
Our work is also the ﬁrst to quantitatively explore viewer
abandonment rates and repeat viewership in relation to stream
quality, last-mile connectivity, and video duration. In addi-
tion, we also study viewer engagement (e.g., play time) in
relation to stream quality (e.g., rebuﬀering) that has also
been recently studied in [9] in a correlational setting, but
we take a step beyond correlational analysis to establish a
causal relationship between quality and engagement using
QEDs. Our work makes the following speciﬁc contributions
on the impact stream quality on viewer behavior.
- We show that an increase in the startup delay beyond
2 seconds causes viewers to abandon the video. Using
regression, we show that an additional increase of the
startup delay by 1 second increases the abandonment
rate by 5.8%.
212- Viewers are less tolerant to startup delay for a short
video such as news clip than a long video such an hour-
long TV episode. In a quasi experiment, the likelihood
of a viewer of short video abandoning earlier than a
similar viewer of a long video exceeded the likelihood
that the opposite happens by 11.5%.
- Viewers watching video on a better connected com-
puter or device have less patience for startup delay
and abandon sooner.
In particular, viewers on mo-
bile devices have the most patience and abandon the
least, while those on ﬁber-based broadband abandon
the soonest.
In a quasi experiment, the likelihood
that a viewer on ﬁber abandoned earlier than a similar
viewer on a mobile device exceeded the likelihood that
the opposite happens by 38.25%.
- Viewers who experienced an increase in the normal-
ized rebuﬀer delay, i.e., they experienced more inter-
ruptions in the video, played the video for lesser time.
In a quasi experiment, a viewer who experienced a re-
buﬀer delay that equals or exceeds 1% of the video
duration played 5.02% less of the video in comparison
to a similar viewer who experienced no rebuﬀering.
- A viewer who experienced a failed visit is less likely
to return to the content provider’s site to view more
videos within a speciﬁed time period than a similar
viewer who did not experience the failure. In a quasi
experiment, the likelihood that a viewer who expe-
rienced failure returns to the content provider’s site
within a week is less than the likelihood of a similar
viewer who did not experience failures by 2.32%.
We show that above results are statistically signiﬁcant using
the sign test. Further, these results show a signiﬁcant level of
causal impact of stream quality on viewer behavior. In this
regard, it is important to recall that small changes in viewer
behavior can lead to large changes in monetization, since
the impact of a few percentage points over tens of millions
of viewers can accrue to large impact over a period of time.
Finally, our work on deriving a causal relationship by sys-
tematically accounting for the confounding variables must
not be viewed as a deﬁnitive proof of causality, as indeed
there can be no deﬁnitive proof of causality. But, rather,
our work signiﬁcantly increases the conﬁdence in a causal
conclusion by eliminating the eﬀect of major confounding
factors that could threaten such a conclusion.
2. BACKGROUND
We describe the process of a user watching a stream, deﬁn-
ing terms along the way that we will use in this paper.
Viewer. A viewer is a user who watches one or more
streams using a speciﬁc media player installed on the user’s
device. A viewer is uniquely identiﬁed and distinguished
from other viewers by using a GUID (Globally Unique Iden-
tiﬁer) value that is set as a cookie when the media player is
accessed. To identify the viewer uniquely, the GUID value
is generated to be distinct from other prior values in use.
Views. A view represents an attempt by a viewer to watch
a speciﬁc video stream. A typical view would start with the
viewer initiating the video playback, for instance, by clicking
the play button of the media player1 (see Figure 1). During
a view, the media player begins in the startup state where
1For some content providers, a “pre-roll” advertisement is
shown before the actual content video is requested by the
it connects to the server and downloads a certain speciﬁed
amount of data, before transitioning to the play state. In the
play state, the player uses the data from its buﬀer and ren-
ders the video on the viewer’s screen. Meanwhile, the player
continues to download data from the server and stores it
in the buﬀer. Poor network conditions between the server
and the player could lead to a situation where the buﬀer is
drained faster than it is being ﬁlled. This could lead to a con-
dition where the buﬀer is empty causing the player to enter
the rebuﬀer state where the viewer experiences an interrup-
tion or “freeze” in the video play back. While in the rebuﬀer
