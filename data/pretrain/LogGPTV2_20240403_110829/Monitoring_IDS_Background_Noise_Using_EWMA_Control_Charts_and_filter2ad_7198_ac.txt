negligible. Tables 2 and 3 depict respectively the reduction as percentage from
non-zero intervals and alerts ﬂagged anomalous, due to space constraints only
for ﬂows of over 10 K alerts. Reduction is shown with smoothing factors 0.80
and 0.92 for each three model, continuous, hourly, and weekday. In Table 2 also
the total number of active intervals, and in Table 3 the total number of alerts
are shown for each ﬂow.

Table 4 summarizes alert reduction results with continuous model and smooth-
ing factor 0.92. All 85 ﬂows are grouped to four classes according to both their
output volume (over 100, 1 K, 10 K or 100 K alerts) and the achieved reduction
in busy intervals and alerts (below 5 %, 10 %, 50 % or 100 % of original), respec-
tively. These results show also the poorer performance for ﬂows below the 10 K
limit. The busy intervals show more consistent relation between the volume and
reduction. On the right hand side of Table 4 in the class over 100 K alerts, ICMP
Dest Unr (Comm Admin Proh) stands out with reduction signiﬁcantly smaller
than others in the same class. We found two explanations for this behavior.
First, there was one large alert impulse of approximately 17 K alerts ﬂagged in
the test data. This makes up roughly 10 % of ﬂagged alerts. Second, the ﬂow na-
ture is more random compared to others, this is visible in Fig. 1(d) for learning
data and applies also for the larger data set. This randomness causes more alert
ﬂagging, but still the reduction in busy intervals is comparable to other ﬂows in
this volume class.
Reasons for poor summarization. There seems to be two main reasons for
poorer performance. 1) Many ﬂows had few huge alert peaks that increase the
alert ﬂagging signiﬁcantly. 2) The intensity proﬁle has the form of impulse train
that has negative impact both on reduction of alerts and busy intervals. As the
ﬁrst cause does not increase remarkably the number of reported anomalous in-
tervals i.e. the number of times the user is disturbed, this is smaller problem.
However, the second cause renders our approach rather impractical for monitor-
ing such a ﬂow, as the operator is notiﬁed on most intervals showing activity.
The ﬂow (spp_stream4) on the last row of Tables 2 and 3 is a typical example,
as its alert proﬁle consisted only from impulses. In such situation a large major-
ity of active intervals are ﬂagged as anomalous. A closer look on alert impulses
revealed that they were usually generated in such a short time interval that
increasing the sampling frequency would not help much. Instead, other means
should be considered to process them.
Represented alert types. Amongst the most proliﬁc signatures, we can iden-
tify three main types of activity, hostile, information gathering and alerts that
can be seen to reﬂect the dynamics of networks.
Monitoring IDS Background Noise Using EWMA Control Charts
181
Hostile activity is represented by DDoS tool traﬃc and worms with ﬁve
signatures. The two DDoS signatures are actually the same, diﬀerent names were
used by the operator for alert management reasons. If busy interval reduction
below 5 % with continuous model and (1 − λ) = 0.92 is used to deﬁne EWMA
monitoring applicable for a ﬂow, then we have three fourths in feasible range for
the hostile activity.
In the system in question, possible information gathering is the most com-
mon culprit for numerous alerts. This category can be further divided to informa-
tion gathering on applications (web related signatures) and network architecture
(ICMP, SNMP and DNS traﬃc). In both categories, there are both suitable and
unsuitable ﬂows for this type monitoring.
The ICMP Destination Unreachable (Communication Administratively Pro-
hibited) message is an example of the activity that describes the dynamics of the
network. It reﬂects the network state in terms of connectivity, and the origins
and causes of these events are generally out of operators control.
Signatures ﬁring on protocol anomalies can be considered as an orthogo-
nal classiﬁcation, since they can present any of the three types above. ((spp
rpc decode), (spp stream4) and BAD TRAFFIC) were all poorly handled by the
method. Another common factor is the smaller degree of presence in the data
set in terms of non-zero intervals. As the (spp_stream4) means possible re-
connaissance, and being present only on 29 intervals, it is less likely to be just
background noise.
The nature of these alerts and their volumes in general support the claim
that large proportion of generated alerts can be considered as noise. Even in the
case of hostile activity the originating events warrant aggregation. This applies
in our case, but the situation may vary with diﬀerent operating environments.
Table 5 shows the signature ﬂows ordered by their omnipresence giving the
number of active intervals and the percentage this makes out of the whole testing
interval. A rough division according to the 5 % watershed is made and type of
signature according to above discussion is assigned. We can see that for all
signatures showing activity on more than 45 % of the intervals the number of
alerts issued to operator can be signiﬁcantly reduced in this system.
It would seem that the omnipresence of alerts would be better criteria than
the alert type for determining whether EWMA monitoring would be useful or
not.
Impact of time slot choice. According to these metrics the usefulness of
daily and weekday models was limited to a few exceptions, generally the con-
tinuous model was performing as well as the others. We just happened to have
one of the exceptions that really proﬁted from hourly approach in our early ex-
perimentations, and made the erroneous hypothesis of their commonness. The
