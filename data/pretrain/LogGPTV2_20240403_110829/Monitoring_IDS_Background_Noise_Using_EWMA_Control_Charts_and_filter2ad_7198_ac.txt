### Monitoring IDS Background Noise Using EWMA Control Charts

#### Reduction in Flagged Intervals and Alerts

Tables 2 and 3 present the reduction in flagged intervals and alerts, respectively, for flows with more than 10,000 alerts. The reduction is shown for different models (continuous, hourly, and weekday) and smoothing factors (0.80 and 0.92). Table 2 also includes the total number of active intervals, while Table 3 shows the total number of alerts for each flow.

#### Summary of Alert Reduction Results

Table 4 summarizes the alert reduction results using the continuous model and a smoothing factor of 0.92. The 85 flows are grouped into four classes based on their output volume (over 100, 1 K, 10 K, or 100 K alerts) and the achieved reduction in busy intervals and alerts (below 5%, 10%, 50%, or 100% of the original).

**Table 4: Grouped Flows by Number of Alerts and Percentage Reduction**

| **Alerts** | **Busy Interval Reduction (%)** | **Alert Reduction (%)** |
|------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **> 100 K** | 5 | 10 | 50 | 100 | 5 | 10 | 50 | 100 |
| > 100 K | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 3 | 4 | 1 | 8 | 0 | 4 | 19 | 12 | 35 | 0 | 1 | 7 | 24 | 32 |
| > 10 K | 5 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 15 | 8 | 30 | 0 | 4 | 14 | 29 | 47 |

These results indicate that flows below the 10 K limit perform poorly. The busy intervals show a more consistent relationship between volume and reduction. For example, in the class over 100 K alerts, ICMP Dest Unr (Comm Admin Proh) has a significantly smaller reduction compared to others in the same class. This can be attributed to two factors: a large alert impulse of approximately 17 K alerts and the more random nature of the flow, as seen in Fig. 1(d).

#### Reasons for Poor Summarization

There are two main reasons for poorer performance:
1. **Large Alert Peaks**: Many flows had few huge alert peaks, which increased the flagging of alerts.
2. **Impulse Train Intensity Profile**: The intensity profile of some flows resembles an impulse train, negatively impacting both alert and busy interval reduction.

The first cause does not significantly increase the number of reported anomalous intervals, making it a lesser problem. However, the second cause makes our approach impractical for monitoring such flows, as the operator is notified about most intervals showing activity. A typical example is the (spp_stream4) flow, where the alert profile consists only of impulses, leading to a large majority of active intervals being flagged as anomalous.

#### Represented Alert Types

Among the most prolific signatures, we can identify three main types of activity:
1. **Hostile Activity**: Represented by DDoS tool traffic and worms, with five signatures. If busy interval reduction below 5% with a continuous model and (1 − λ) = 0.92 is used, then three-quarters of these flows are feasible for EWMA monitoring.
2. **Information Gathering**: The most common cause of numerous alerts, divided into application-related (web signatures) and network architecture (ICMP, SNMP, and DNS traffic).
3. **Network Dynamics**: Examples include ICMP Destination Unreachable (Communication Administratively Prohibited) messages, reflecting the network state in terms of connectivity.

Signatures firing on protocol anomalies can be considered an orthogonal classification, as they can represent any of the three types above. These alerts and their volumes support the claim that a large proportion of generated alerts can be considered noise, even in the case of hostile activity.

**Table 5: Signature Flows Ordered by Omnipresence**

| Flow | Active Intervals | Percentage of Testing Interval | Type of Signature |
|------|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Flows showing activity on more than 45% of the intervals can have their alerts significantly reduced in this system. The omnipresence of alerts appears to be a better criterion than the alert type for determining the usefulness of EWMA monitoring.

#### Impact of Time Slot Choice

The continuous model generally performed as well as the daily and weekday models. The hourly model was beneficial in a few exceptions, but the overall performance of the continuous model was comparable.
