User: Please introduce the basic principles of distributed systems and commonly used data partitioning and sharing methods.
Assistant: distributed system is a system composed of multiple independent computer nodes. These nodes are connected together through a network and work together. Different nodes can perform different tasks, and they need message transmission and coordination to complete tasks. Distributed systems usually have the following basic principles: 1. Transparency: Users of distributed systems should not feel that they are using a distributed system, just like using a single computer. 2. Collaboration: Different nodes need to work together to complete tasks. This includes operations such as communication, synchronization, coordination, and coherence. 3. Exception handling: Distributed systems need to handle abnormal situations such as node failure, message loss, and network delay. 4. Scalability: A distributed system should be able to scale horizontally or vertically as business needs grow to meet system availability and performance requirements. In terms of data partitioning and sharing, commonly used methods include: 1. Vertical partitioning: Split a relational database table into multiple tables by column, and each table contains only relevant columns. This method is suitable for scenarios with small data volume and simple logical relationship. 2. Horizontal partitioning: Divide the table into multiple tables by row, and each table contains only part of the data. This method is suitable for scenarios with a large amount of data and relatively complex logical relationships. 3. Copy and backup: copy data to multiple nodes to ensure data availability and fault tolerance. 4. Consistent hashing: Map data to different nodes through the hash algorithm to achieve load balancing and failover. 5. Consensus protocol: such as Paxos algorithm or Raft algorithm, consensus among multiple nodes ensures the consistency and availability of the system.
