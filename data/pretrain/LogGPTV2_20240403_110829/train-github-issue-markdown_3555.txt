I'm using Atom on Linux Mint 17. Whenever I open Atom, I noticed my HDD led
blinking like crazy. iotop shows atom is doing a lot of disk reads:
     5241 be/4 jfsantos    6.48 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 37.54 % atom --ev~trap.js');
     5242 be/4 jfsantos    5.75 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 36.67 % atom --ev~trap.js');
     5244 be/4 jfsantos    4.75 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 32.67 % atom --ev~trap.js');
     5243 be/4 jfsantos    3.83 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 30.87 % atom --ev~trap.js');
As soon as I close Atom, everything gets back to normal (iotop shows 0.00 B/s
as total disk reads, as opposed to something around 12 M/s with atom running).
I tried disabling all 3rd party plugins I downloaded but it did not help. Is
there anything I could do to help investigating this issue?
