### Description
To protect sensitive data stored at rest in cloud storage, it is essential to implement encryption. Most cloud service providers offer managed encryption keys, which can be rotated periodically to enhance security. As a minimum requirement, ensure that your incident response plan for storage breaches includes key rotation. Additionally, it is crucial to test the impact of key rotation on client applications to avoid any disruptions.
