##### Description of the problem
I don't know if it is expected or if I miss something, but it looks like the
envmap textures generated by PMREGenerator and the renderer specified at that
time cannot be re-used with another renderer.
In this example, the envmap is generated using **renderer**.  
If the scene is rendered with **renderer2** , it doesn't work.
  * jsfiddle
Replace `var pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator( renderer );`  
by `var pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator( renderer2 );`  
on line 49 to check the difference.
