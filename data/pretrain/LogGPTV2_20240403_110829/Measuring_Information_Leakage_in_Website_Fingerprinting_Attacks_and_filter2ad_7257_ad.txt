Figure 8: Closed-World Setting: Information Leakage by Categories (bit). The aggregate information from most categories of feature
grows with the world size, indicating that these categories of features can be used to distinguish between larger sets of websites
Joint Information Measurement. Among the 100 most infor-
mative features, many of the features share redudant information
with other features. We set a threshold to 0.9, and if two features
have mutual information larger than 0.9, we would consider a fea-
ture sharing most of its information with another one. Our results
show that 62 of the 100 most informative features can be repre-
sented by the other 38 features, demonstrating the prevalence of
redundant features in website ﬁngerprint. This ﬁnding shows the
necessity and eﬀectiveness of our Mutual Information Analyzer in
recognizing features sharing redundant information. Figure 8 also
shows that after including suﬃcient non-redundant features, the
category information leakage tends to reach plateau. This phenom-
enon shows that we can approximate the information of a category
by including suﬃcient non-redundant most informative features in
this category.
Categories such as Time, Ngram, Transposition, Interval-II, Interval-
III, Packet Distribution, Packet per Second, and CUMUL leak most
of the information about the visited websites; other categories such
as Packet Count, Interval-I, Burst, First20, First30 Packet Count,
Last30 Packet Count leak 5.75, 5.86, 6.2, 4.20, 1.29, and 1.03 bits
information, respectively. Our measurement shows that Interval-
II and Interval-III leak more information than Inerval-I, with 6.63
bits for both Interval-II and Interval-III. In addition, we ﬁnd that
Interval-II and Interval-III are faster than Interval-I in reaching the
plateau, indicating the former twos not only leak more information
but also with less features. It is clear that recording intervals by
their frequency of packet count (adopted in Interval-II and Interval-
III) is more preferable than recording them in sequence (Interval-I).
We also experiment the impact of world-size on information
leakage upon categories in closed-world setting. We ﬁnd that with
the increase of world size, most categories exhibit more informa-
tion leakage, except First30 and Last30 Packet Count. Note that
categories such as First20, Burst, Packet Count show little increase
when the world size increases from 1000 to 2000. We leave the dis-
cussion to Appendix F.

This section validates our measurement results by bootstrapping [12].
Bootstrapping is a statistical technique which uses random sam-
pling with replacement to measure the properties of an estimator.
More details about bootstrapping are given in Appendix A.

our measurement is. We adopt bootstrapping with 20 trials to give

Figure 10: Dataset and Generalization: the 90% conﬁdence in-
terval by bootstrapping
the 90% conﬁdence interval for the information leakage measure-
ment. Figure 9 (a) shows the conﬁdence intervals for top 100 most
informative features. We ﬁnd that the width of the intervals is less
than 0.178 bit, and the median is around 0.1 bit. Figure 9 (b) gives
the 90% conﬁdence interval for 15 categories. The width of these in-
tervals is less than 0.245 bit, with the median 0.03 bit. We ﬁnd that
the interval of interval-I has the largest width. The bootstrapping
results validate our information leakage measurement.
Dataset Validation. We use the top 100 Alexa websites in the
closed-world setting, as do previous works. But what if the top
100 Alexa websites are not representative for Tor networks? Do
our information leakage results still hold? While the representative
websites are still unknown, we are able to validate our results by
bootstrapping.
In the experiment, we have 2200 websites for bootstrapping. In
each round, we randomly sample 100 websites without replace-
