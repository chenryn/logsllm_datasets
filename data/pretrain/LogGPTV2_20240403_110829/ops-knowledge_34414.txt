User: For Python 3.2, What is recommended: easy_install-3.2 or easy_install?
Why two execs? What's the difference? 
One more question: distribute or setuptools? setuptools is obviously not working on 
Intel Win64/python3.2 (or not available as of writing this post).
Assistant: Answering just to the first question.
Regarding easy_install, since you might have multiple python versions installed, you might have also different easy_install versions installed (one for each python version). In that case, easy_install will be the default version and easy_install-X.Y will be the version to install new packages for python-X.Y.
