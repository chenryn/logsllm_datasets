   A New Threshold Password Authentication Scheme  Yung-Cheng Lee  Department of Security Technology and Management, WuFeng University, Chiayi, Taiwan. PI:EMAIL Keywords: Password authentication; Threshold scheme; Secret sharing. Abstract. The well-known password authentication mechanisms are widely used in networks to protect resources from unauthorized access. The ad hoc networks, due to their dynamic and lack of network infrastructure features, require authentication schemes to ensure security. In this paper, we propose a new threshold password authentication scheme for ad hoc networks. Our scheme can be efficiently implemented in mobile devices, and can achieve mutual authentication with registered users. Introduction The ad hoc network [15], constructed by a group of mobile devices without using any network infrastructure, is suitable for military or emergency uses. Ad hoc network causes a lot of security challenges such as unauthorized access due to its flexibility and lack of secure network infrastructure. Password authentication schemes are the simplest and most convenient authentication mechanisms in network environment to protect unauthorized access. Until now, there are many schemes proposed [2–6, 8-12, 14, 17, 18]. However, due to their security shortcomings, most schemes could not be applied in ad hoc networks. In 1981, Lamport proposed the first well-known password authentication scheme [11]. However, Lamport’s scheme suffers from the modification and stolen-verifier attack [3]. In 2000, Hwang and Li proposed a new remote user authentication scheme to overcome the weakness [9]. However, their scheme does not allow users to freely choose their passwords. Yang and Shieh [18] presented a timestamp based password authentication scheme that allows users to freely update their passwords while still keeps the merit that the remote server does not require to store passwords or verification table. However, their scheme suffers from online guessing attacks [14]. In 2007, Chai et al. proposed a threshold password authentication scheme [1], which meets both availability and strong security requirements of the mobile ad hoc networks. In their scheme, t out of n servers can jointly achieve mutual authentication with a registered user through two rounds of message exchanges. Their scheme allows users to choose and change their password freely. However, Li has shown that their scheme cannot resist passive attack [13].  In this paper, we propose a new threshold password authentication scheme for ad hoc networks. Our scheme is efficient to be implemented in mobile devices, and can achieve mutual authentication with registered users. The scheme can stand guessing attack and replay attack, while possesses the merits such as mutual authentication and no password table required. Preliminaries In this section, we briefly described the one-way hash function, discrete logarithm problem, and Shamir’s secret sharing scheme. Then we introduce some notations that used throughout this article. One-way hash function and discrete logarithm problem. Let )(h be a one-way hash function. That is given x it is easy to compute )(xhy=, however, given y, it is infeasible to find x satisfying yxh=)(. Let g be a generator of *pZ, where p is a large prime. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the difficulties of inverting a one-way hash function and solving discrete logarithm problem [7]. 916

   Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme. Shamir’s ),(nt secret sharing scheme is a well-known mechanism for key management. In ),(nt secret sharing scheme, a dealer shares a secret x among n servers {nSS,...,1} such that given at least t shares the secret x can be recovered, while given less than t shares nothing could be known about x. The Shamir’s ),(nt secret sharing scheme includes secret sharing phase and secret reconstruction phase as follows. Secret sharing phase. In secret sharing phase, the dealer:  Select a secret x (xp<) and a random polynomial ()f⋅ satisfying (0)fx= over *pZ of degree 1t−. Compute and send share ()modixfip=through secure channel to each server iS, 1,...,in=.  Secret reconstruction phase. In secret reconstruction phase, the process is as follows.  At least t servers release their shares ix to the dealer. The dealer could recover the secret x by Lagrange interpolation method: ,(0)modiiiiijjijxfxLxpij∈Ω∈Ω∈Ω≠−===−∑∑∏, where {1,...,}nΩ⊂ and tΩ≥. Notations.  Throughout this paper, all notations are defined as follows. U: A user who joined the authentication protocol ID: User’s identity. PW: User’s password. S: A collection of n remote servers, 12{,,...,}nSSSS=. n: The number of all the servers in S. t: The minimal size requirement of a group of servers to perform authentication operation. iS: A server in S, {1,...,}in∈. x: The secret of all the remote servers in S. ix: The secret share hold by iS. q: A large prime. p: A large prime satisfying 21pq=+. T: A timestamp. ()h⋅: A public secure one-way hash function. Ω: An index set of a random subgroup of S with the size of t. That is 12{,,...,}nSSSΩ⊂ and tΩ≥. iL The Lagrange coefficients, ,ijjijLij∈Ω≠−=−∏. : Concatenation symbol. The New Threshold Password Authentication Scheme In this Section, we propose a new threshold password authentication scheme for ad hoc networks. The scheme is composed of three phases: (1)the registration phase, (2)the login phase, and (3)the authentication phase. In the registration phase, a new user sends his identity ID and shadowed password )(PWh to a group of remote servers S. After the user’s identity is confirmed, a group of remote servers satisfying the minimal group size requirement t will issue a ticket containing personalized information to the user. The user stores the ticket in his/her own mobile login device. When the user wants to access remote servers, he/she inputs his identity ID and password PW to his/her login device. Then the device will send a login request message to servers. After receiving the login request message, t out of n remote servers will jointly verify it and send back response message to obtain mutual authentication in the authentication phase. Advanced Materials Research Vols. 143-144

   Suppose that one of the servers, being called as dealer, is responsible for communicating with the user and the rest of servers. Initially, a set up process could be performed by the dealer using Shamir secret sharing scheme as follows: Select a random polynomial ()f⋅ over *pZ of degree 1t−, satisfying (0)fx=. Compute ()ixfi= and send ix to iS through a secure channel.  Discard x. After being set up, each server iS holds a secret share ix. Certainly, iS doesn’t know any information about the secret x. The registration, login phase, and authentication phase are described briefly as follows.  Registration Phase. A user U submits his identity ID and shadowed password )(PWh to the collection of remote servers S through a secure channel. After the identity ID is confirmed, the server iS computes and sends the following value to the dealer: pIDhBiximod)(=. After collecting all iB, the dealer computes: )()(PWhBiLii+∏=Ω∈β. Note that )()(PWhIDhx+=β. Finally, the dealer issues the ticket ))(,,,,(⋅hqpIDβ to U through a secure channel. Then U stores the ticket in his/her login device.  Login Phase. When U wants to login to S, he/she inputs his ID and PW to his/her own login device. Then, the login device will: Select a random number *prZ∈, and pick up the current timestamp T of the login device. Compute ()modBhPWpβ=−. Note that ()xBhID=. Compute modrEBp=. Note that ()rxrEBhID==. Compute ()modrDhIDp=. Compute modFEBp=⋅ and ()ChTF=  . Send the login request message (,,,)MIDTDC= to S. Authentication Phase. After receiving request message, the servers do the following steps to authenticate user.  Each iS checks the validity of ID and timestamp T. If they are not correct or not in a suitable time interval, the login request will be rejected. Each iS computes and sends '()iiiixLxLiFDhID=⋅ to the dealer. Note that  '()()iiiirxLxLFhIDhID=⋅. After collecting all 'iF, the dealer computes ''iiFF∈Ω=∏. Note that '()()iiiiiirxLxLFhIDhID∈Ω∈Ω∑∑=⋅ ()()rxxhIDhID=⋅. The dealer checks whether the equation (')ChTF= holds. If it does not hold, the request will be rejected; otherwise, the login request will be accepted. The dealer computes '('')ChFT= and sends (,','IDCT) back to U, where 'T is the new timestamp of the dealer. After receiving the message (',',TCID), the login device will check the validity of ID and 'T, and then check whether the equation '('')ChFT= holds. If they are valid, the mutual authentication between U and S is established; otherwise, the login device may restart a new login phase. Security Analysis. In the proposed scheme, though each server knows '()()rxxFhIDhID=⋅ after authentication phase; however, he cannot distinguish ()rxhID or ()xhID from 'F.  On the other hand, if an adversary wants to find  xIDh)( from intercepted message iiiiLxLxiIDhDF)('⋅=, it still 918

   cannot obtain ()xhID because of the adversary cannot distinguish ()iixLhID from 'iF. Therefore, the secret of the user will not be disclosed. Since the adversary cannot know ()rxhID or ()xhID, it is difficult to release a fake request message (,,,)MIDTDC= such that ()ChTF=, where ()()rxxFhIDhID=⋅. If adversary randomly chooses an integer r and computes ''()rDhID=, he also cannot find 'C such that''(()())rxxChThIDhID=⋅ since ()xhID is unknown. Based upon above analysis, the scheme can resist insider impersonate attack and a dishonest server cannot masquerade as a legal user for a successful login. The scheme can also stand guessing attack and replay attack. Moreover, the scheme obtains mutual authentication while there is no password table required. Summary Password authentication is a well-known mechanism to protect resources from unauthorized access. However, many schemes suffer from security risk such that most of those schemes could not be used for ad hoc networks. In this paper, we have proposed a new threshold password authentication scheme for ad hoc networks. In the scheme, t out of n server can jointly achieve mutual authentication with  users, while the impersonate attack can be avoided. References [1] Z. Chai, Z. Cao, and R.
