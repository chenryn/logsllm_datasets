When using the new ConPTY feature it seems there is some behind the scenes
optimisation happening surrounding colours that is assuming colour state. For
example when using the default background/foreground escape sequences
([49m/[39m), they are either getting removed or changed into a reset sequence
([m), this make it difficult to write a frontend to ConPTY that wants to for
example have a window background colour that isn't one of the colours
specified by the escape sequences. (i.e. where [m and [49m would do different
things).
And example of this is at https://github.com/brads55/conpty-testcase (based on
the EchoCon sample), where the following can be seen:

I also suspect this is the cause of #293.
  * What's wrong / what should be happening instead:
It would be great if either these optimisations didn't happen or there was at
least a way of disabling them in order to get the real raw escape sequences.
