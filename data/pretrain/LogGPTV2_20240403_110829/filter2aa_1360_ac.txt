### Managing Passwords with a Password Manager

Managing multiple passwords can be a daunting task. A password manager, such as KeePassXC, provides a secure database to store all your login credentials and other sensitive information. 

Recently, I have found Proton VPN to be more effective for online investigations compared to PIA (Private Internet Access). PIA, being one of the largest VPN providers, often faces blocks from websites due to misuse and fraud. Proton VPN, while slightly more expensive, is equally secure and less likely to be blocked. If a website blocks my IP address from PIA, switching to Proton VPN usually resolves the issue. Any reputable VPN is better than no protection at all.

### Setting Up Your Password Manager

Now that you have a secure password manager and database ready for use, let's assume you are ready to change the password for your covert Facebook profile. Here’s how to do it using KeePassXC:

1. **Navigate to the Password Change Menu:**
   - Go to the settings menu in Facebook where you can change your password.

2. **Generate a New Password:**
   - Open KeePassXC.
   - Use the built-in password generator to create a new, secure, randomly generated password. Ensure it includes letters, numbers, and special characters. Aim for a length of at least 50 characters if the website allows it.

3. **Store the New Password:**
   - Save the new password in KeePassXC. You won’t need to remember it; the password manager will store it securely.

4. **Update Other Passwords:**
   - As you log into other sites, use KeePassXC to generate and store new, unique passwords for each site. This ensures that if one site is breached, the compromised password won’t work on any other site.

### Using Browser Extensions

KeePassXC offers browser integration through an extension. While this can make logging in more convenient, I prefer manual copying and pasting to ensure security. However, if you choose to use the extension, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Browser Extension:**
   - Download and install the KeePassXC browser extension from the official repository.
   - Connect the extension to your KeePassXC database.

2. **Enter Passwords Manually:**
   - When prompted to enter a password, copy it from KeePassXC and paste it into the website. This deliberate act helps avoid potential automation vulnerabilities.

### Backing Up Your Password Database

The master password for your KeePassXC database should be unique and never used before. It should include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. Write it down in a safe place until you memorize it. Regularly back up your password database by saving a copy on an encrypted USB drive or another secure location. This ensures you won’t lose access to your passwords in case of data loss.

### Security Considerations

Using an offline password manager like KeePassXC eliminates the risk of online attacks. By keeping your password manager on your host machine, you can access it regardless of which virtual machine you are using during an investigation.

### Creating a Secure Investigation Environment

#### Chapter 2: Linux Virtual Machines

This chapter focuses on enhancing your security by using a Linux operating system for your investigations. Linux is lightweight, runs on almost any hardware, and is free. It also provides a higher level of security compared to traditional operating systems like Windows.

#### Installing VirtualBox

To get started, you need to install VirtualBox, a free and easy-to-use virtualization software. Here are the steps to install VirtualBox on your computer:

1. **Download VirtualBox:**
   - Visit [virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
   - Click the appropriate link for your operating system (e.g., "OS X Hosts" or "Windows Hosts").
   - Download the latest stable version, not a beta version.
   - Also, download the Extension Pack for your version.

2. **Install VirtualBox:**
   - Install the downloaded file (dmg for Mac, exe for Windows) with default settings.
   - Double-click the Extension Pack and add it to VirtualBox.

#### Setting Up a Linux Virtual Machine

I recommend Ubuntu as the ideal Linux distribution for our OSINT machine. Here’s how to set up an Ubuntu VM:

1. **Create a New Virtual Machine:**
   - Open VirtualBox and click "New".
   - Name the VM (e.g., "OSINT Original").
   - Choose "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu (64-bit)" as the version.
   - Allocate 50% of your system memory to the VM.
   - Create a virtual hard disk (VDI) and allocate at least 40GB of space.

2. **Configure the Virtual Machine:**
   - In the VirtualBox settings, go to "Storage".
   - Click the CD icon and select the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded.
   - Start the VM and follow the installation prompts:
     - Select "Install Ubuntu".
     - Choose your language and location.
     - Select "Normal Installation" and "Download Updates".
     - Erase the disk and install Ubuntu.
     - Set the time zone.
     - Enter a name, username, and password (use "osint" for both the username and password).
     - Choose to log in automatically.

3. **Post-Installation Steps:**
   - Disable crash reporting and usage statistics:
     ```bash
     sudo apt purge -y apport
     sudo apt remove -y popularity-contest
     ```
   - Launch "Settings" and disable notifications.
   - Insert Guest Additions CD Image from the VirtualBox menu and run the installer.
   - Restart the VM.

By following these steps, you will have a secure and functional Ubuntu VM for your OSINT investigations.
