daunting task. A password manager provides a secure database to store all of the various settings in regard to 
these profiles. My choice is KeePassXC.
Lately, 1 have had better success with Proton VPN than P1A in regard to online investigations. PI A is one of the 
largest VPN providers in the world, and many sites block them due to abuse and fraud. Proton VPN is equally 
as secure, but not as popular. When a website blocks me because I possess an IP address from PIA, I can almost 
always connect to the site by switching over to Pro ton VPN. ProtonVPN is a bit more expensive than PLA, but 
you may have less headaches. Any reputable VPN is better than no protection. I always display current 
recommended VPN affiliate purchase options on my site at https://inteltechniques.com/vpn.html.
You now have a secure password manager and database ready for use. Assume you are ready to change the 
password to your covert Facebook profile. Navigate to the menu which allows change of password. Next, 
conduct the following within KeePassXC.
You successfully created a new, secure, randomly generated password for your covert profile. You will not 
remember it, but your password manager will. From this moment forward, you will change every password to 
any site that you access upon logging in. The next time you log in to your secure sites, change any passwords. 
Allow your password manager to generate a new random password containing letters, numbers, and special 
characters. If the website you are using allows it, choose a password length of at least 50 characters. When you 
need to log in, you will copy and paste from the password manager. For each site which you change a password, 
your password manager will generate a new, unique string. This way, WHEN the site you are using gets breached,

the passwords collected will not work anywhere else. More importantly, recycled passwords will nor expose vour 
true accounts after the breached data becomes public. There should be only a handful of passwords' you 
memorize, which brings us to the next point.
If you really want integrated browser support, KccPassXC has this option. You can install the browser extension 
and easily enter passwords into websites without leaving the browser. This will be explained later. I believe this 
is safe, and I have used it during investigations in the past. Today, I believe that copying passwords into websites 
should be a deliberate act that requires effort without automation. I don’t want a machine doing this for me. 
The attraction to online password managers such as Lastpass and Dashlane is the ability to sync the password 
database to all devices over the internet 1 understand the benefits of these features, but it also comes with risk 
All reputable online password managers encrypt the passwords locally on the user’s device before syncing with 
their own servers. Theoretically, no one at the password manager company would have the ability to see your 
individual passwords. However, nothing is hack-proof. It is only a matter of time before something goes wrong.
The password to open your password manager should be unique. It should be something you have never used 
before. It should also contain letters, numbers, and special characters. It is vital that you never forget this 
password, as it gives you access to all of the credentials that you do not know. I encourage users to write it down 
in a safe place until memorized. It is vital to make a backup of your password database. When you created a new 
database, you chose a name and location for the file. As you update and save this database, make a copy of the 
file on an encrypted USB drive. Be sure to always have a copy somewhere safe, and not on the internet If your 
computer would completely crash, and you lose all of your data, you would also lose all of the new passwords 
you have created. This would be a huge headache. Prepare for data loss now.
By keeping your passwords in an offline database, you eliminate this entire attack surface. By keeping your 
password manager ready in your host machine, you will have immediate access to it regardless of which virtual 
machine you are using during an investigation. That brings us to the next chapter. It is now time to create our 
investigation environment.

Lin u x  Vir t u a l  Ma c h in e s
This chapter presents ways that you can harden your security by using a Linux operating system during your 
investigations. Many years ago, this may have been intimidating to non-technical users. Today, implementing 
Linux into your investigations is extremely easy. This chapter is intentionally at the beginning of the book in 
order to better protect you and your investigations right away. Once we start exploring the world of online 
search techniques, you will likely encounter malicious software or viruses at some point. If you investigate cyber 
criminals, this will be sooner rather than later. The malicious code will almost always target Windows machines. 
By choosing Linux as your investigations system, you greatly lessen the concern about infections. This chapter 
will vary from basic tutorials through advanced technologies. I present material on Linux before online searching 
because I want you to have a safe and secure environment for your research, without the fear of exposing your 
personal computer.
In 2015,1 actively taught methods that would take a standard Linux system, such as Ubuntu or Mint, and install 
it to a USB device. This device could be inserted into a computer, booted, and a native Linux system would be 
present. When the machine was turned off, all history of that session was eliminated. This was a quick and easy 
way to conduct high-risk investigations while protecting the integrity of a personal computer. Unfortunately, 
this was slow, mostly due to the speed bottleneck of the USB device. It was a valid practice with good intentions, 
but not extremely applicable to most OSINT investigators today. Previous editions of this book had an entire 
chapter devoted to creating these devices. Today, 1 discourage it
Linux operating systems have been a part of my OSINT investigations and trainings for many years. They are 
lightweight, run on practically any hardware, cost nothing, and provide a level of security that cannot be obtained 
through traditional operating systems such as Microsoft Windows. During my training, 1 often demonstrate how 
I use Linux as a virtual machine (VM) or bootable USB device. In both scenarios, I can navigate to any malicious 
website, download ever}’ virus possible, and eliminate all traces of my activity by simply rebooting the system 
while reverting the VM. Upon reboot, there are no viruses and everything works exactly as intended when the 
system was created.
This concept is not new. Many readers are likely familiar with I Jnux systems such as Kali. This is a custom 1 jnux 
build which includes hundreds of security testing tools for the cyber security community. It is considered an all- 
in-one operating system that has everything pre-configured upon installation. We wanted that same experience 
for the OSINT community. Buscador was designed from the ground up with considerations for OSINT 
investigations. The web browsers were pre-configured with custom settings and extensions, and numerous 
OSINT software applications were already set-up to accept your search queries.
In 2016,1 was contacted by David Westcott. We knew each other through our OSINT work, and he asked if I 
was interested in creating a custom OSINT virtual machine. I had always considered this, but had concerns 
about my skills at hardening Linux systems and pushing out finished builds. David had worked on other public 
Linux releases, and was much more comfortable distributing custom systems. I began designing my drcam 
OSINT build, sending him weekly requests, and he began taking the ideas and executing them within a test 
product. By 2017, the first public version of our new operating system was released and titled Buscador (Seeker 
in Spanish).
An important part of Buscador was the applications. On many Linux builds, launching software is nor similar 
to traditional operating systems. While the software is installed, you must still launch a Terminal window and 
type the specific commands required. This can be very difficult and unforgiving. There are seldom point-and- 
click icons that launch similar to Windows. This has always created a barrier between the geeks and the norms. 
Either you know how to issue Linux commands or you do not. If you don't, then you never get to take advantage 
of the power of Linux and Python.
Today, my views of pre-built virtual machines have changed slightly. While I

Volumes could be written about the features and abilities of VirtualBox. I will first explain how to install the

Buscador, 1 believe we should no longer rely on systems from third parties. Buscador is no longer updated with 
new versions, and there is no online repository to apply updates to the many applications within the virtual 
machine. 1 no longer offer a direct download link to Buscador from my site because security patches have not 
been applied since 2019. Many of the people using Buscador now receive errors due to outdated applications 
and most users do not have the training to apply their own updates in order to correct any issues. Creating a 
virtual machine which was user friendly had many benefits, but also some unintended consequences. My goal in 
this chapter is to help you easily create and maintain your own OSINT Linux virtual machine with all of the 
features of Buscador. Overall, we should never rely on a single source for our OSINT resources. It is easier than 
ever to build your own version of Buscador while keeping it updated. By the end of this section, you will possess 
a custom OSINT Linux, Windows, or Mac machine which rivals any pre-built options available through various 
providers. Better yet, you will have built it yourself and can replicate your steps whenever desired, while being 
able to explain your actions.
Virtual machines (VMs) conduct emulation of a particular computer system. They are computer operating 
systems on top of computer operating systems. Most commonly, a software program is executed within an 
operating system, and individual operating systems can launch within that program. Each virtual machine is 
independent from the other and the host operating system. The environment of one virtual machine has no 
impact on any others. Quite simply, it is a way to have numerous computers within your single computer. When 
finished, you can safely investigate a single target within a secure environment with no contamination from other 
investigations. You will be able to clone an original VM in minutes and will no longer need to worry about 
persistent viruses, tracking cookies, or leftover evidence.
We wanted to eliminate that barrier. We wanted to make powerful Linux programs easily accessible to everyone. 
My initial thought was to create Bash scripts similar to batch files in Windows, but David came up with a much 
easier and more appropriate way. Every tool inside Buscador had its own icon in the Dock, executed by clicking 
with a mouse, which walked the user through the menus. After collecting the required data, each program 
executed the proper commands behind the scenes and delivered the content directly to the user. We believed 
this to be unique in our community. Every person, at any skill level, could use Buscador as a Linux virtual 
machine for immediate OSINT work.
Before creating a virtual machine, you must possess virtual machine software. There are several programs which 
allow you to create and execute virtual machines. Some of these are paid programs, such as VMWare. However, 
I will focus mostly on VirtualBox here. VirtualBox is completely free and easy to operate. All methods presented 
here for VirtualBox can be replicated on VMWare or any other virtualization software.

While VirtualBox is free software, make sure your organization meets the requirements for usage of the free 
Extension Pack license. The only requirement for VirtualBox to function is a computer that suppons 
virtualization. Any modern Apple product will work without any modification. Most mid-range and high-end 
Windows computers made within the past five years should have no problem, but may require you to enable 
virtualization support in the BIOS (Basic Input / Output System) during startup. Netbooks, older machines, 
and cheap low-end computers will likely give you problems. If you are in doubt about meeting this requirement, 
search for your model of computer followed by "virtualization" and you should find the answers. The rest of 
this section will assume that your computer meets this requirement.
This may be quite controversial to some Linux enthusiasts, but I recommend Ubuntu as an ideal Linux operating 
system for our OS1NT machine. While 1 use a Debian build for my own personal use due to the privacy' and 
security of that operating system, Ubuntu is more appropriate for a wider audience. Debian can present 
complications when trying to display' the Dock or enable sudo features. If you are comfortable with Debian and 
insist on using it versus Ubuntu, go for it. For those who want an easier option, I will only explain the process 
using Ubuntu.
As I write this, the current stable release of Ubuntu is 20.04 LTS, and my’ entire build is based on that release. 
LTS refers to Long-Term Support. This version will receive updates and patches until April of 2025. As you 
read this, you may see a "newer" version such as 20.10 or 21.04. While this may seem more appropriate for daily’ 
use, it is not. Versions which begin with an odd number or end in ".10" are interim releases with a short support 
cycle. Only’ versions which begin with even numbers and end in ".04" should be considered. If you are reading 
this after April of 2022, you will likely’ see a version labeled 22.04. This should be used instead of 20.04, and 
most, if not all, of the following tutorials should function. If not, I will update the digital files available to you 
for download, which will be explained more later. Always use the latest LTS release.
First, we need to download an ISO file containing the installation files for Ubuntu. The official website is very’ 
user-friendly, and can be reached at ubuntu.com/download/desktop. This presents a Long-Term Support (LTS) 
option, which is currendy’ 20.04.03. Clicking the "Download" button should prompt you to download the ISO 
file required to install Ubuntu. This will be a large file with an extension of iso. During this writing, my file was 
titled "ubuntu-20.04.03-desktop-amd64.iso". This file behaves similarly to a physical CD which would install 
Windows or any’ other operating sy'stem. The 64-bit version should apply’ to most readers and their computers. 
If you know you need a 32-bit version for an older computer, y’ou will find it in the "Alternative Downloads" 
section of the site. Save the file to your Desktop or anywhere else to which you have easy’ access. Expect an 
approximate file size of 2GB. Next, open VirtualBox and click on the button labeled "New". The following 
steps create a VM appropriate for our needs.
You may’ have heard of Ubuntu Linux. It is one of the most popular Linux distributions, and it is based on 
Debian as its backbone. Ubuntu is the product of a corporation called Canonical. Some still criticize Ubuntu for 
previously including Amazon software in the default downloads, which provided affiliate funding to Ubuntu 
when you made an online purchase, but this has been removed in current versions. The following could be 
replicated with other "flavors" of Linux if desired, with minimal differences within installation menus. As new 
versions of Ubuntu are released, you may see minor changes to the following tutorials. However, the general 
functions should remain the same. Before we continue, I should explain Ubuntu versioning.
