To effectively implement CIS Control 14.9, which focuses on conducting role-specific security awareness and skills training, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Identify Training Needs**: Assess the specific roles within the organization and determine the unique security challenges and requirements for each. This will help in tailoring the training content to be relevant and effective.

2. **Develop Role-Specific Training Programs**:
   - **For IT Professionals**: Offer secure system administration courses that cover best practices in maintaining and securing IT infrastructure.
   - **For Web Application Developers**: Provide training on the OWASPÂ® Top 10 vulnerabilities, including how to identify, prevent, and mitigate these common security risks.
   - **For High-Profile Roles (e.g., Executives, HR, Finance)**: Conduct advanced social engineering awareness training to help them recognize and respond to sophisticated phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics.

3. **Implement Regular Training Sessions**: Schedule regular training sessions to ensure that all employees are up-to-date with the latest security threats and best practices. This can include both initial onboarding training and periodic refresher courses.

4. **Evaluate and Update Training Content**: Continuously review and update the training materials to reflect new threats, technologies, and organizational changes. This ensures that the training remains relevant and effective.

5. **Monitor and Measure Effectiveness**: Use metrics and feedback mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of the training programs. This can include post-training assessments, simulated phishing attacks, and other methods to gauge employee understanding and compliance.

6. **Integrate Training into Organizational Culture**: Foster a culture of security awareness by integrating training into the overall organizational strategy and making it a part of the company's core values.
