North Korea does have an IT school.  Every year, one hundred male students, who matriculate as 
young as 8 years old, are chosen to attend the Kumsong computer school, where they study 
computer programming and English.  They are not permitted to play games, or to access the 
Internet, but they are allowed to Instant Message each other within the school.  A visiting 
Western journalist reported the use of Taiwanese hardware and Microsoft software. 
According to the South Korean Chief of Military Intelligence, top graduates from the Kim Il-
Sung Military Academy have been chosen for an elite, state-sponsored hacker unit.  Allegedly, 
they have been instructed to develop “cyber-terror” military options on direct orders from Kim 
Jong-Il.  Broadly speaking, DRPK intelligence collection is said to be fairly sophisticated, with a 
clear collection focus on South Korea, the U.S., and Japan. 
Internet connections from North Korea back to Earth are channeled via Moscow and Beijing 
through the Korea Computer Centre (KCC), established in 1990.  The KCC provides the 
government in Pyongyang with its international pipe, and serves as its IT hub.  Reports suggest 
that it downloads an officially approved, limited amount of research and development 
information, and pushes it to a very short list of clients. 
The government’s official stance on Internet connectivity is that it cannot tolerate an influx of 
“spiritual pollution” into the country.  However, the DRPK has been caught operating a state-run 
“cyber casino” on a South Korean IP address.  Since that discovery, South Korean companies 
have been under orders not to register North Korean sites without government approval.
Notes from the Underground 
Cyber Control 
Technology moves far faster than any government bureaucracy.  The Internet changes every 
second.  We post our messages on dozens of new websites every day, and push the addresses out 
before the government can block them.  By the time they censor us, we are no longer there.  
While Big Brother may prevent some basic cyber attacks, they never even see the clever ones.  
Underground sources are now providing us with computer software that will bring this 
government to its knees. 
The Internet, just like a living organism, needs air to breathe.  It thrives based only on the 
open exchange of information.  The most likely thing about the future is that it will be ever 
more wired.  Our challenge is to turn better communication into more power for the common 
man.  Human rights battles will continue to be waged in the future, but time is on our side.  
If the government continues to strangle the development of the Internet in our country, the 
end result will be death to the economy, and then death to the state.  Either way, we win. 
Cyber Resistance 
The Internet has done more for the cause of freedom than any technology in history, for both 
activists and for ordinary citizens.  Traditional media pale in comparison, as the printing 
press and radio are much more susceptible to government control. 
However, we still have much to fear.  The reports from Minsk are not encouraging.  There are 
no magic bullets, only hard work ahead.  Even under our new government, the rights of the 
people to live in privacy and peace will have to be balanced with legitimate law 
enforcement powers.  As an immediate goal, negotiations should push for transparency.  The 
government must explain everything it is doing, and why. 
Retain a high degree of skepticism regarding everything you see on the Internet.  Increase 
vigilance at key times such as elections.  Truth is hard enough to find in the real world.  In 
cyberspace, it is ten times harder.  Cyber proof may require that you already know the 
answer to the question you are asking, or that you verify what you find from second source.   
A freedom fighter, a terrorist, and a government agent walk into an Internet chat room.  
Which of them emerges alive?  The only way to know for sure is to arrange a meeting in real 
life! 
Resistance Tools 
If I tried to offer you one specific cyber solution, the government would subvert it and use it 
against us.  Revolutionary corps cadres are studying dozens of strategies to provide us with 
both information and anonymity.  Here are some of the basic tools: 
~ Direct access to foreign ISPs 
~ Telephone, Web, Satellite 
~ Anonymous email correspondence 
~ Remailers, RSS Mailer 
~ Anonymous Web browsing 
~ P2P, Proxy servers, Encryption 
~ Dead drops in cyberspace 
~ Saving information at a prearranged location 
~ Steganography 
~ Hiding truth among the lies 
~ Covert channels 
~ Normal activity at unusual times 
~ Common hacker tools 
~ Cyber magic in a box 
~ Out of the box thinking 
~ Saving text as pictures 
New tools are frequently released.  A recent program called Psiphon is specifically designed for 
information gathering in countries like ours.  It is easy to use, and should be difficult for 
governments to discover.  Here is how it works: a computer user in a free country installs 
Psiphon on his computer, then passes a comrade in a country like ours connection 
information, including a username and password, usually by telephone or posted mail.  The 
censored user can then open an encrypted connection through the first user’s computer to the 
Internet.  This type of communication is difficult for the government both to target and to 
decipher. 
No single strategy or tool will provide us a perfect solution, because the Internet will never 
behave exactly as anyone, including the government, would like.  One final warning:  if you 
feel that you are personally being targeted by Big Brother, lay low.  You may already be in a 
position where very little can help you. 
The Future 
Our understanding of world affairs and human rights is growing dramatically, especially in the 
Internet era.  In the future, hopefully it will be impossible to enslave or even to fool millions of 
people.  The Internet may be our ticket out of here, so we must try to master it. 
Big Brother has many advantages over the people, in brute force and in technology.  His tools are 
everywhere, and they are more precise than ours.  Still, the government is also constrained by the 
limits of technology, which are considerable. 
Always be suspicious of Internet outages.  Try to understand whether the government is targeting 
the population as a whole, or you personally.  Is the information you seek known to the 
government?  Are there key words that spies could find?  You will have to answer the most 
important question for yourself:  does the information you seek not exist, or was the government 
keeping it from you?
