### Expected Behavior
When I print a pdf using print({ silent: true, printBackground: true }) } I
expect for it to work and print without showing dialog box of printing
options, but use the default print configuration.
### Actual Behavior
It does not print but remains stuck if default print option is print. If I set
it to Microsoft Print to Pdf, it prints an empty doc.
If I use executeJavaScript('window.print({ silent: true, printBackground: true
})'), it prints but it is not silent. This problem exists only with pdf.  
I updated electron version to 13.0.0 but there the pdf view does not work
also, it stucks showing blank pages, so I had to downgrade.
Silent pdf printing is a very important feature and I have seen other people
asking about it, but still no solution.
