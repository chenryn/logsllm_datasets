A few days ago I came across the following problem and to the conclusion that
it was a bug.
After adding the package "ImageView" the command "sin(BigFloat(3))" can only
be executed with an error message (see screenshot).
Affected is Julia 1.2/1.3 RC3 and the current nightly version.
The error can be reproduced on my Windows 10 system (Core-i3 4 GByte RAM -
Developer-Mode) as often as I want, even if I have completely reinstalled
Windows.  
It is noticeable that after 1 out of 10 attempts to uninstall Julia and
reinstall, no error occurred.
Also with the installation on another computer it worked immediately error
free.
I already reported this to a member of JuliaImages/ImageView.jl (timholy) and
he advised me to report this as a Julia bug. ( JuliaImages/ImageView.jl#181 )
