ABSTRACT 
With  internet-connected,  SCADA  and  cyber-physical  systems 
becoming the next battlefield for crime and warfare, technologies 
for  defending  and  attacking  these  systems  are  growing  in 
prevalence.  For entities with significant asset collections that are 
prospectively  vulnerable  to  this  type  of  an  attack,  autonomous 
response,  retaliation  and  attack  capabilities  are  necessary  to 
respond to a growing threat from numerous sectors.  This paper 
presents a command and control technique for cyberwarfare based 
on  the  Blackboard  Architecture.    It  discusses  the  utility  of  this 
approach and proposes a distributed command system that can run 
across multiple nodes of various types.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Technological capabilities that were the province of imagination 
50 years ago and science fiction ten years ago have become and 
are  becoming  reality.    Many  of  these  technologies  are  network 
connected and rely on access to remote data and utilize local and 
remote computational capabilities to deliver their function.  Some 
technologies,  like  those  used  for  remote  surgery  [1],  remotely 
piloted  aircraft  [2],  national  security  applications  and  many 
cyberphysical  systems  need  to  be  protected  from  data  theft  and 
denial of system operation and access to requisite data streams. 
While defensive technologies are required for all applications and 
may  represent  a  complete  solution  for  some  where  temporary 
denial  of  service  is  acceptable,  for  other  applications  an  active

response  is  required.    State  actors  may  also  seek  to  engage  in 
(and/or  offensively  defend  against)  cyberwarfare,  for  which 
defensive-only technologies are not suitable. 
This  paper  presents  a  distributed  command  and  control 
architecture  for  the  operation  of  the  weapons  of  cyberwarfare, 
cyberdefense and cybersecurity.  The proposed approach utilizes 
a distributed Blackboard Architecture capable of operating across 
numerous  configurations  to  support  a  multitude  of  prospective 
applications.    The  technology  is  designed  to  support  operations 
from  both  owned/controlled  hardware  and  the  use  of  temporary 
adversary network-homed ‘forward operating locations’. 
This paper continues with an overview of prior work that provides 
a foundation for the work presented herein.  Then, the proposed 
system is described. 
2.  BACKGROUND 
The sophistication of cyberspace threats is growing: moving from 
discrete  categories  of  attack  to  merged  “more  damaging  forms” 
[3].  Attack quantities are also increasing: for example, between 
2000  and  2009,  the  number  of  reported  incidents  targeting  the 
U.S. Department of Defense grew fifty-fold. 
Actors  range  from  cybercriminals  (who  have  a  variety  of 
motivations  and  prospective  targets  [4])  to  perpetrators  of  so-
called ‘hactivism’ [5] to state actors to terrorists (who may target 
critical  infrastructure,  a  “target  ripe  for  terrorism”  according  to 
Pedersen  [6]).  A multitude of prospective targets exist, ranging 
from point of sale systems to cyber-espionage.  Special concern 
exists,  however,  with  regards  to  systems  that  interact  with  the 
physical  world  such  as  remote  surgery  systems  [1],  remotely 
piloted  aircraft  [2],  “smart  grid”  power  systems  [7]  and  other 
supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  systems.  
Concern also exists regarding technologies that could be used to 
track  citizens’ 
impair 
emergency response mechanisms [9].   
The  prospective  involvement  of  state  actors  raises  special 
considerations.  These range from questions of who acts on behalf 
of a state and what constitutes an act of war to what involvement 
national defense entities should have in cybersecurity. 
A  wide  variety  of  attacks  have  been  implemented  by  various 
attackers.    Attack  types  have  included  denial  of  service  attacks, 
ARP  poisoning,  unauthorized  access  (including  hypervisor 
attacks,  rootkits  and  “VM  escape”  attacks)  [10],  code  injection, 
“drive by exploits” and insider and other targeted attacks [11].   
A  variety  of  defense  and  response  techniques  have  been 
developed in response to this growing threat.  Atoum, Otoom and 
Ali  [12]  present  a  holistic  cyber  security  framework;  however, 
location  and  characteristics  [8]  or 
1681many others focus on specific component technologies.  One area 
where autonomy has been used frequently is intrusion (and more 
broadly,  attack)  detection  systems.    Techniques  utilized  have 
included  network  visualization,  active 
learning,  Bayesian 
networks,  genetic  algorithms,  nature-inspired  algorithms  and 
various  combinations  such  as  the  genetic  fuzzy  and  pairwise 
learning-based system developed by Elhag, et al. [13].  Systems 
have had goals ranging from detecting unauthorized changes  to 
using  mobile  phone  carrier  networks  to  characterize  criminal 
entity  participation  [14]  to  identifying  and  preventing  so-called 
“identity theft attack” on social networks [15]. 
3.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 
The proposed system is based on a distributed blackboard which 
collects  (or  is  supplied)  information,  makes  decisions  based  on 
this  information  and  triggers  actions  (in  some  cases)  based  on 
those decisions.  It operates based on a rule-satisfaction principle, 
where  it  is  tasked  with  one  or  more  high-level  goals  and  an 
augmentable  fact-rule-action  network  which  defines  how  the 
system operates.  Several different aspects of the system are now 
described.    First,  the  distributed  control  approach  is  presented.  
Then,  the  communications  model  is  presented.    Next,  system 
operations are discussed.  Distributed Control Approach 
The distributed control approach for the proposed system utilizes 
a  modified  version  of  the  Blackboard  Architecture  [16]  in  a 
(backwards) problem-solving mode (discussed in [17]).  While, in 
many  cases,  it  has  a  single-goal  solution  (e.g.,  a  particular 
objective), multi-goal support (see [18]) is also included. 
This  control  approach  is  very  versatile  and  can  be  adapted  to  a 
variety  of  usage  scenarios,  each  of  which  would  result  in  a 
somewhat  different  rule  network.    For  example,  a  system 
developed  to  attack  a  target  might  have  the  destruction  (or 
impairment, etc.) of the target as a single goal and the rule / action 
/ fact network would be designed to provide multiple prospective 
pathways  to  this  goal.    Alternately,  a  system  designed  to  take 
offensive  actions  to  protect  a  cyberasset  might  have  asset 
protection  as  a  goal  and  a  network  of  rules,  facts  and  actions 
designed  to  represent  multiple  pathways  to  the  impairment  / 
compromise / damage / destruction of this asset, which must be 
prevented.  A variety of other applications and corresponding rule 
/ action / fact networks are possible to support other needs. 
The  system  has  a  mechanism  to  develop  additional  rules,  facts 
and  actions,  based  upon  changing  conditions.    In  particular,  an 
application-specific classifier mechanism can be used to identify 
additional  assets  of  an  entity-target  and,  based  on  the  type  of 
systems  detected,  new  rule  /  fact  /  action  chains  are  built  to 
represent the prospective new targets and attack vectors to target 
systems or systems under protection. 
A  boundary  object-based  Blackboard  modification  (described  in 
[19])  is  utilized  to  coordinate  between  the  various  parts  of  the 
multi-homed system.  Figure 1 presents the logical architecture of 
the system.  It is comprised of numerous local blackboards which 
share  boundary  facts  with  a  global  virtual  blackboard.    This 
virtual blackboard is shared between all of the local blackboards 
and may, in some applications, also have a centralized repository 
(in addition to the shared copy).  When a fact is changed on this 
shared  virtual  blackboard,  it  is  made  available  to  all  local 
blackboards.    Rule  processing  and  action  triggering  (which  is 
intentionally minimized in this design) for the central blackboard 
can be processed by any of the parts of the multi-homed system.
