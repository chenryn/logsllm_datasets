## ABSTRACT
As internet-connected SCADA and cyber-physical systems become the new frontlines for crime and warfare, the need for both defensive and offensive technologies is growing. For entities with significant and potentially vulnerable assets, autonomous response, retaliation, and attack capabilities are essential to counter threats from various sources. This paper introduces a command and control technique for cyberwarfare based on the Blackboard Architecture. It discusses the benefits of this approach and proposes a distributed command system that can operate across multiple nodes of different types.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Technologies that were once the realm of imagination and science fiction are now becoming reality. Many of these technologies are network-connected and rely on remote data and computational resources. Examples include remote surgery systems, remotely piloted aircraft, national security applications, and various cyber-physical systems. These systems must be protected from data theft and denial of service attacks. While defensive measures are crucial, some applications require an active response, and state actors may engage in or defend against cyberwarfare, necessitating more than just defensive capabilities.

This paper presents a distributed command and control architecture for cyberwarfare, cyberdefense, and cybersecurity. The proposed approach uses a distributed Blackboard Architecture capable of operating across various configurations to support multiple applications. The system is designed to function on both owned/controlled hardware and temporary adversary network-homed "forward operating locations."

The paper proceeds with an overview of prior work, followed by a detailed description of the proposed system.

## 2. BACKGROUND
Cyberspace threats are becoming more sophisticated, evolving from discrete categories of attacks to more damaging forms [3]. The number of reported incidents targeting the U.S. Department of Defense, for example, increased fifty-fold between 2000 and 2009.

Threat actors range from cybercriminals with diverse motivations and targets [4] to hacktivists [5], state actors, and terrorists who may target critical infrastructure [6]. Potential targets include point-of-sale systems, cyber-espionage, and systems that interact with the physical world, such as remote surgery systems, remotely piloted aircraft, and smart grid power systems [7].

State actors raise additional considerations, including questions about who acts on behalf of a state and what constitutes an act of war. Various attack types have been implemented, including denial of service attacks, ARP poisoning, unauthorized access, code injection, drive-by exploits, and targeted attacks [10, 11].

In response to these threats, a variety of defense and response techniques have been developed. Some frameworks, like the one presented by Atoum, Otoom, and Ali [12], offer holistic approaches, while others focus on specific component technologies. Autonomy has been frequently used in intrusion and attack detection systems, employing techniques such as network visualization, active learning, Bayesian networks, genetic algorithms, and nature-inspired algorithms [13, 14, 15].

## 3. PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system is based on a distributed blackboard that collects information, makes decisions, and triggers actions. It operates on a rule-satisfaction principle, with high-level goals and an augmentable fact-rule-action network defining its operations.

### 3.1 Distributed Control Approach
The distributed control approach utilizes a modified version of the Blackboard Architecture [16] in a problem-solving mode [17]. It supports both single-goal and multi-goal solutions [18]. This approach is versatile and can be adapted to various scenarios, each requiring a different rule network.

For example, a system designed to attack a target might have the destruction or impairment of the target as its goal, with the rule/action/fact network providing multiple pathways to achieve this. Conversely, a system designed to protect a cyberasset would have asset protection as its goal, with a network of rules, facts, and actions designed to prevent the impairment, compromise, damage, or destruction of the asset.

The system can develop additional rules, facts, and actions based on changing conditions. An application-specific classifier mechanism identifies new assets and builds new rule/fact/action chains to represent potential new targets and attack vectors.

A boundary object-based Blackboard modification [19] coordinates the multi-homed system. Figure 1 shows the logical architecture, which consists of local blackboards sharing boundary facts with a global virtual blackboard. This virtual blackboard is shared among all local blackboards and may also have a centralized repository. When a fact is changed on the shared virtual blackboard, it is made available to all local blackboards. Rule processing and action triggering for the central blackboard can be processed by any part of the multi-homed system.
