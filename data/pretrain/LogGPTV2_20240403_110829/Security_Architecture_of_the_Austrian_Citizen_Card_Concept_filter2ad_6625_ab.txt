### Certification Service Provider (CSP) and Qualified Signatures

A **Certification Service Provider (CSP)** is responsible for issuing qualified certificates, which form the basis of a qualified signature. A qualified certificate contains, among other information, the signer’s public key—also known as the **Signature Verification Data (SVD)**. The issuance of qualified certificates must meet certain requirements, such as the use of trustworthy systems.

**Member States** designate appropriate public or private bodies to assess the conformance of signature products, such as smart cards, to the requirements laid down for **Secure Signature Creation Devices (SSCDs)** or for the trustworthy systems used by CSPs. This ensures mutual recognition of SSCDs within the European Union (EU).

To establish a harmonized view on these security requirements, the **European Commission** can publish reference numbers to recognized standards. The **European Electronic Signature Standardization Initiative (EESSI)** was established for this purpose. The **European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)** and the **European Committee for Standardization (CEN)** have been entrusted with developing these standards. Among the standards developed are the list of algorithms eligible for qualified signatures, such as:

- **Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA)** with 1024-bit keys.
- **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)** with 1024-bit keys.
- **Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA)** with 160-bit keys.

Additionally, **Common Criteria (CC) protection profiles** for SSCDs and hardware security modules (HSMs) used by CSPs have been developed.

The directive required EU member states to implement national signature laws by July 2001. Although the directive provides a common framework, national implementations in Europe show some variations. For example, the Austrian signature law and the signature order require that security-relevant components involved in the signature-creation process be assessed by a confirmation body, as designated by the directive.

### Security-Relevant Components

The security-relevant components that need to be assessed include:

- **SSCD**: Implements the SCD (the private key).
- **Components to trigger the signature-creation process**: Such as the components for entering a personal identification number (PIN), ensuring the PIN is not intercepted.
- **Viewer component**: Ensures that the data to be signed (DTBS) is correctly displayed to the signer without any dynamic or hidden information.
- **Hash function**: If provided outside the SSCD, and the communication link delivering the DTBS (the hash value) to the SSCD.

The rationale behind the Austrian signature law requiring the assessment of the SSCD environment, even though the directive limits the conformity assessment to the SSCD itself, is based on technical considerations. To ensure that a qualified signature cannot be forged, the PIN in transfer must not be intercepted. An impostor who gains access to the SSCD could create a signature if they intercept the PIN. Interception of the PIN and tampering with the DTBS by trojan horses have been demonstrated for smart-card solutions available in the market. Countermeasures based on trusted computing platforms are proposed to address these issues.

### Signature-Creation System

Figure 2 illustrates a signature-creation system. The SSCD is shown as a smart card, a technology chosen for its ability to meet the security requirements, particularly due to its physical protection. The figure also shows the CC evaluation assurance levels (EAL) appropriate for fulfilling the security requirements, which are EAL4 augmented for the SSCD and EAL3 for other security-relevant functions.

To counter threats to the SSCD environment, the communication channels between the SSCD and the PIN-pad, and for communicating the DTBS to the SSCD, are shown as trusted paths and trusted channels. This ensures confidentiality and integrity, preventing an attacker from tampering with these channels.

### Identification and Delivery

In section 2, it was discussed that identification solely based on a certificate, such as an X.509 certificate, usually does not provide the online quality required for e-Government applications. The reason is that the CSP registration information is typically not accessible online.

Under Austrian registration laws, a unique central registration number, called the ZMR number, is assigned to each citizen. A process called "persona binding" has been developed, where an extensible markup language (XML) record is generated and signed by the authority. For physical persons, the persona binding contains the ZMR number, the name of the individual, their date of birth, and the SVD (the public key) of the person. This data structure is signed using the XML digital signature (XMLDSIG) standard. Similar bindings for legal persons, such as associations, use alternatives to the ZMR, such as an official association number.

While the persona binding can provide the online identification quality required for e-Government, data protection aspects do not allow for unrestricted use of the ZMR number. A further step is required to inhibit prohibited inference between independent administrative procedures. Amendments to public procedures laws define that a number termed VPK, which is encrypted and procedure-specifically derived from the ZMR, may be used for identification purposes and stored, while the ZMR may not be kept with the procedure’s records. The implementation involves merging the person-specific ZMR with an ID of the administrative process and applying a cryptographic hash function, as illustrated in Figure 3.

### Process-Specific ID (VPK)

The process described in Figure 3 ensures that each time a citizen accesses an administrative body, by combining the ZMR number under the citizen's control with the administrative body’s ID, the same unique number can be generated. This allows for process state tracking, similar to packet delivery services, but under more stringent data protection provisions, as the individual permitted to track the state is identified by their persona binding under their control.

The final legal provision to enable e-Government is the conclusion of a process, i.e., the delivery of notification. In many cases, this requires evident delivery, such as with registered letters. To enable electronic delivery, the notification of delivery law has been amended. The technical process involves the authority depositing the notification on a delivery server, which then attempts to electronically deliver an indication that a notification can be downloaded from the server. This indication can be sent via various media, such as email, fax, or cell phone short message service (SMS). The addressee can then download the notification, and the process ends with an acknowledgment of receipt that is electronically signed by the citizen. If the electronic indication does not reach the citizen or the citizen does not carry out the download for other reasons, the delivery server reverts to conventional methods.
