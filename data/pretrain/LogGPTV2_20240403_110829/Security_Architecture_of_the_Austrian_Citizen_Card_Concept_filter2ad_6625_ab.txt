The  member  states  designate  appropriate  public  or 
private  bodies  that  assess  the  conformance  of  signature 
products  such  as  smart-cards  to  the  requirements  laid 
down for SSCDs or for trustworthy systems used by CSPs. 
This  also  provides  mutual  recognition  of  the  SSCDs 
within the EU. In order to establish a harmonized view on 
these  security  requirements,  the  European  Commission 
can  publish  reference  numbers  to  recognized  standards. 
The  European  Electronic  Signature  Standardization 
Initiative (EESSI) [3] has been established therefore. The 
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) 
and  the  European  Committee  for  Standardization  (CEN) 
have  been  entrusted  to  develop  such  standards.  Among 
these  is  the  list  of  algorithms  eligible  for  qualified 
signatures  [4].  Among  the  signature  suites  defined  in [4] 
are  Rivest,  Shamir,  Adleman  (RSA)  [5]  or  digital 
signature algorithm (DSA) [6] with 1020 bit keys, or DSA 
variants  based  on  elliptic  curves  [7]  with  160  bit  keys. 
Moreover,  Common  Criteria  (CC)  [8] protection profiles 
for SSCDs [9] or hardware security modules (HSM) used 
by CSPs [10] have been developed 2.  
The  directive  had  to  be  implemented  by  the  EU 
member  states  by  July  2001,  i.e.  national  signature  laws 
had to be put in force by that date. Although the directive 
gives  a  common  framework,  national  implementations  in 
Europe  show  a  few  refinements.  The  Austrian  signature 
law  [11]  and  the  signature  order  [12]  e.g.  lay  down  that

to  be  assessed 
include  the  SSCD  that  implements  the  SCD  (the  private 
key).  The  components  to  trigger  the  signature-creation 
process are security-relevant, e.g. the components to enter 
a  personal  identification  number  (PIN),  as  the  PIN  may 
not  be  intercepted.  Moreover,  the  components  to  be 
assessed  include  the  viewer  component  ensuring  that  the 
data  to  be  signed  (DTBS)  is  correctly  displayed  to  the 
signer  without  any  dynamic  or  hidden  information. 
Finally, the hash function, if provided outside the SSCD, 
and  the  communication  link  delivering  the  DTBS  (the 
hash value) to the SSCD are security-relevant.  
A  rationale  for  the  Austrian  signature  law  requiring

qualified signature may not be forged the PIN in transfer 
may not be intercepted as an impostor getting hold of the 
SSCD may create a signature. Interception of the PIN and

Figure 2  illustrates  a  signature-creation  system.  The

To  counter  the  threats  on  the  SSCD  environment,  the 
communication channels between the SSCD and the PIN-
pad,  and  for  communicating  the  DTBS  to  the  SSCD  are 
shown  as  trusted  paths  and  trusted  channels.  I.e.  the 
trusted  path 
to  maintain 
confidentiality  and  integrity,  the  trusted  channel  for  the 
DTBS  needs  to  maintain  integrity.  This  shall  ensure  that 
an  attacker  can  not  tamper  with  these  channels  and  also 
follows  the  approach  taken  with  the  SSCD  protection 
profiles developed by EESSI [9]. Further requirements on 
the  SSCD  environment  that  have  been  developed  by 
EESSI  are  given  in  [15].  An  in-depth  discussion  on  the 
requirements  for  SSCDs  and  implementation  guidelines 
for different SSCD-technologies are discussed in [16]. 
3.2 Identification and delivery 
It  has  been  discussed  in  section  2  that  identification 
solely  on  the  basis  of  a  certificate,  such  as  a  X.509 
certificate,  usually  does  not  provide  the  identification  of 
an

Government  applications.  The  reason  is  that  the  CSP 
registration information is usually not accessible online.  
individual 
in 
Under  the  Austrian  registration  laws,  a  unique  central 
registration number is assigned to each citizen – called a 
ZMR  number  [17].  We  developed  a  process  called 
‘persona  binding’  [18]  where  an  extensible  markup 
language (XML) record is generated that is signed by the 
authority.  For  physical  persons,  the  persona  binding 
contains the ZMR number, the name of the individual, his 
date of birth, and the SVD (the public key) of the person. 
This  data  structure  is  signed  using  the  XML  digital 
signature 
[19].  Comparable 
bindings  for  legal  persons  such  as  for  associations  are 
similarly constructed, but use alternatives to the ZMR, e.g. 
an official association number.  
(XMLDSIG) 
standard 
While  the  persona  binding  can  provide  the  online 
identification  quality  required  for  e-Government,  data 
protection aspects do not allow for unrestricted use of the 
ZMR  number  as  identification  of  the  citizen.  A  further 
step  is  required  to  inhibit  prohibited  inference  between 
independent  administrative  procedures,  e.g.  between 
applying for a driver’s license and a tax declaration. The 
provisions made in amendments to public procedures laws 
[20]  are  to  define  that  a  number  termed  VPK  that  is 
encrypted  and  procedure-specifically  derived  from  the 
ZMR may be used for identification purposes and may be 
stored,  while  the  ZMR  may  not  be  kept  with  the 
procedure’s records. The implementation is basically, that

of  the  administrative  process  and  a  cryptographic  hash 
function is applied. This is illustrated in figure 3.

tracking as e.g. common with packet delivery services, but 
under  more  stringent  data  protection  provisions,  as  the 
individual permitted to track the state is identified by his 
persona binding under his control.  
The final legal provision to enable e-Government is the 
conclusion  of  a  process,  i.e.  the  delivery  of  notification. 
This in many cases requires evident delivery, such as with 
registered  letters.  To  enable  electronic  delivery,  the 
notification  of  delivery  law  [21]  has  been  amended.  The 
technical process that can be followed is basically that the 
authority can deposit the notification on a delivery server. 
This server attempts to electronically deliver an indication 
that  a  notification  can  be  downloaded  from  the  server. 
Such  an  indication  can  be  send  by  various  media,  as  by 
email,  fax,  or  cell  phone  short  message  service  (SMS). 
The addressee can than download the notification and the 
process  ends  with  an  acknowledgement  of  receipt  that  is 
electronically signed by the citizen. In case the electronic 
indication does not reach the citizen – e-mail addresses or 
cell  phone  numbers  may  have  been  changed  –  or  the 
citizen does not carry out the download for other reasons, 
the  delivery  server  cranks  back  to  conventional  methods
