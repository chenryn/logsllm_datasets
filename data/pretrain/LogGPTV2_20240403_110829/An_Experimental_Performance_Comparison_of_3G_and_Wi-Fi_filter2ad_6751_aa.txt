Abstract. Mobile Internet users have two options for connectivity: pay
premium fees to utilize 3G or wander around looking for open Wi-Fi
access points. We perform an experimental evaluation of the amount of
data that can be pushed to and pulled from the Internet on 3G and
open Wi-Fi access points while on the move. This side-by-side compar-
ison is carried out at both driving and walking speeds in an urban area
using standard devices. We show that signiﬁcant amounts of data can be
transferred opportunistically without the need of always being connected
to the network. We also show that Wi-Fi mostly suﬀers from not being
able to exploit short contacts with access points but performs compa-
rably well against 3G when downloading and even signiﬁcantly better
while uploading data.
1 Introduction
Wireless communication is an important part of everyday life. It allows people to
stay connected with their jobs, family, and friends from anywhere there is con-
nectivity. The two dominant wireless technologies are Wi-Fi and third generation
cellular (3G) networks.
IEEE 802.11, commonly known as Wi-Fi, refers to a set of standards which
operate in the unregulated ISM band[1]. They are very well known for providing
wireless connectivity in homes, oﬃces, and hot-spots. They provide throughput
of up to 600 Mbits/s[2] with a coverage area in the hundreds of meters. Wi-Fi is
easy and inexpensive to deploy, and is ubiquitous in urban areas. Despite access
controls being deployed and newer access points (APs) being conﬁgured with
security enabled by default, many Wi-Fi APs remain open[9]. In addition, the
growing popularity of community networks such as FON1 and the growing list of
large cities providing free wireless makes opportunistic communication a realistic
scenario in urban areas.
Due to the sparse and non-coordinated deployment of APs, Wi-Fi is not an
“always connected” technology. It is designed primarily for the mobile user that
accesses the network while relatively stationary. It provides high data rates be-
tween locally connected clients but is limited by the capacity of the link between
the AP and the Internet.

3G is based on technology that has evolved to ﬁll the growing need for data in
wireless voice networks. 3G provides seamless connectivity across large coverage
areas with advertised data rates of 2 to 14 Mbits/s, shared among all users
connected to any given base station. 3G network operators charge either based
on consumption or have ﬂat rate monthly plans. These networks are expensive
to deploy and the performance experienced by users is sensitive to the number
of users in a cell due to the large coverage areas.
For data applications, one could argue that persistent connectivity may not
be necessary. Instead, being connected “frequently enough” should be acceptable
if applications and communications protocols could take advantage of short, but
high bandwidth contact opportunities.
We present results of a side by side, Wi-Fi vs 3G face-oﬀ. We show that
with default access point selection (greatest signal strength), unmodiﬁed network
setup methods (scan, associate, request an IP address with DHCP), and oﬀ the
shelf equipment with no modiﬁcations or external antennae, opportunistic Wi-Fi
performance is comparable to 3G. Despite only connecting to open or community
access points in a typical urban residential area, Wi-Fi throughput surpasses 3G
at walking and driving speed while uploading data and is nearly equivalent to
3G while downloading.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We ﬁrst explain how the
experiments were conducted and describe the equipment and software setup in
Section 2. Next, in Section 3, we show the results of the experimental runs with
the comparisons of 3G vs Wi-Fi under driving and walking conditions as well as
look at the eﬀects related to the uploading or downloading of data. Finally, we
discuss related work in Section 4 and conclude the paper in Section 5.
2 Experiment Description
The experiments consist of two mobile clients and a server that is always con-
nected to the Internet. One mobile client uses its Wi-Fi interface to transmit
and receive data to/from the server and the other uses 3G. Experiments are per-
formed both on foot and in a car following the same route. Wi-Fi and 3G tests
are run simultaneously for a true side-by-side comparison. While downloading,
the data originates at the servers and is streamed down to the mobile clients.
Conversely, when uploading, the data originates on the mobile clients and is
streamed to the servers.
We investigated the potential of using the 3G device for collecting both 3G
and Wi-Fi data but discovered that stationary Wi-Fi transfers in the uplink
direction were capped around 6 Mbits/s, well below the advertised rates of an
802.11G enabled interface. We also saw variations in the Wi-Fi throughput while
running simultaneous 3G and Wi-Fi experiments on the same mobile device. Due
to these limitations, we chose to use a separate platform for each technology.
2.1 Server Setup
The servers run the Ubuntu distribution of Linux (version 8.04.1 with a 2.6.24-
19-server kernel) and are publicly accessible machines on the Internet that are the

source or sink for the clients. The servers are virtual machines running on the Open
Cirrus cluster[11] hosted at Intel Labs Pittsburgh (ILP). The dedicated Internet
connection to ILP is a 45Mbit/s fractional T3 and did not pose any restrictions
in these experiments. We ran extensive tests of the code on the virtual machines
and saw no performance related issues with the system or the network.
The 3G server runs the apache web server and hosts large, randomly generated
data ﬁles that can be downloaded by the client. The Wi-Fi server runs a simple
socket program that generates data with /dev/random and streams it down to
the Wi-Fi client. When data is being uploaded from the client, both the 3G
and Wi-Fi server run our socket program that receives the data and sends it to
/dev/null. The network interfaces for both servers are monitored with tcpdump
and the resulting data traces are stored for oﬀ-line analysis.
2.2 Wi-Fi Client
The Wi-Fi client setup consists of an IBM T30 laptop with a default install
of the Ubuntu distribution of Linux (version 8.04 with a 2.6.24-21-server ker-
nel). The internal wireless device is the Intel 2915ABG network card using the
unmodiﬁed Intel open source Pro/Wireless 2200/2915 Network Driver (version
1.2.2kmprq with 3.0 ﬁrmware). No external antenna is connected to the laptop
for the experiments.
The laptop attempts to connect to the Internet by ﬁrst scanning the area for
available open or community APs (excluding those with encryption enabled and
those we have marked as unusable2) and chooses the one with the strongest signal
strength. Once the AP is selected, it begins the association process followed by
IP acquisition via DHCP. If the AP allocates an IP address to the client, it
attempts to ping a known server to conﬁrm connection to the Internet. Once
Internet connectivity is veriﬁed, the Wi-Fi client begins either downloading or
uploading data from/to the server via our simple socket program. After the client
travels out of range of the AP, it detects the severed connection by monitoring
the amount of data traversing the network interface. Once the client stops seeing
packets for more than a conﬁgured time threshold, the current AP is abandoned
and the search for another available AP begins. We choose 5 seconds in our
experiments to allow ample time to make sure we do not attempt to reconnect
to an AP that is at the trailing edge of the wireless range.
All experimental runs utilize a USB global positioning system (GPS) receiver
that is plugged into the laptop capturing speed, location, and time once per
second. The GPS device is also used to synchronize the time on the laptop. The
laptop captures all data that is transmitted or received over the wireless interface
with tcpdump.
2.3 3G Client
The 3G experiments employ an out of the box Apple iPhone 3G with no mod-
iﬁcations to the hardware. The iPhone connects via the AT&T 3G network,

uses a jail-broken version of the ﬁrmware (2.2, 5G77), and its modem baseband
ﬁrmware is at version 02.11.07.
The 3G client begins by ﬁrst synchronizing its clock with NTP. Once the
clock has been synchronized, it launches tcpdump to monitor the 3G wireless
interface. After the monitoring has started, the client begins either downloading
or uploading data. To download data, we use an open source command line
tool for transferring ﬁles called curl. The curl program downloads a large ﬁle
from the server and writes the output to /dev/null to avoid unnecessary CPU
and battery consumption on the mobile device. This also allows us to isolate
only network related eﬀects. If the client is uploading data, the dd command
continuously reads data out of /dev/zero. The output is piped into netcat and
the data is streamed to the server.
2.4 The Experiment Route
The experiments are performed in a residential area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
near the campus of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Figure 1(a) is a map of
the area where we focused our measurement collection. This area lies between
the CMU campus and a nearby business district where many students frequently
travel. Each red tag in the ﬁgure represents an open Wi-Fi AP found from our
wireless scans3. The area is also covered by 3G service allowing us to compare
the two access technologies. We believe this area to be representative of typical
Wi-Fi densities found in most European or US urban areas4.
Figure 1(b) shows the route selected in this area for our experiments. The
experiment starts at the leftmost tag at the bottom right hand corner of the ﬁg-
ure and follows the indicated route until the destination (same as start position)
is reached. The total distance of the route is about 3.7 miles. For the walking
experiments, we maintain a constant speed (2.4 MPH) throughout the course of

the route. While driving, we obeyed all traﬃc laws and signs and remained as
close to the speed limit (25 MPH) as possible.

device is able to transfer around 55 MB of data for the 760 seconds of the exper-
iment duration. During this time, the Wi-Fi client connects opportunistically to
APs along the route and manages to spend 223 seconds connected, transferring
34 MB. These “in the wild” results clearly show the potential of this untapped
resource of open Wi-Fi connectivity and have a similar behavior to the isolated
and controlled experiments in [5,6,14].
Deeper investigation of our logs shows that the majority of contacts were
initiated while the client was either stopped, slowing down, or accelerating after
a stop. This meant that the client stayed within the range of a single AP for
longer durations and allowed more time to perform the steps needed to setup a
connection and begin a data transfer. Since our AP selection algorithm was to
