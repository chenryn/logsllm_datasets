User: I cannot figure out how to install pyopencl with Cygwin. Never used Cygwin before so I am very lost as to how I initiate python and use it to run my .py setup files.
Assistant: Did you install Python into Cygwin?

If not, launch setup.exe, get to the packages screen, and do a search for python. 
You can install 2.6.8 and 3 side by side if you want.

After that it's like using python anywhere else. You can do a $ python my.py to run my.py. You can install easy_install or pip, etc. if they'll help. Otherwise, follow the directions for PyOpenCL and you should be good!
