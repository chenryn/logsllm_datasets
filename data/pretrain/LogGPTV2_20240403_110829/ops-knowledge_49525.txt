Question: A network administrator is reviewing the configuration of a local network that employs NAT as part of its DHCP setup. The administrator is concerned about possible vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Which of the following vulnerabilities could be a concern when using NAT in the network?
"A": "NAT may lead to IP address conflicts if it assigns the same public IP to multiple internal devices simultaneously.",
"B": "NAT could potentially expose all devices on the local network to direct attacks from the internet by mapping all internal IPs to one public IP.",
"C": "Attackers might take advantage of the predictable nature of private IP address assignments to guess the structure of the internal network.",
"D": "The use of NAT may increase the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, as external packets are translated to internal addresses."
Answer: C
