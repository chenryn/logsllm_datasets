We are using SciPy 1.1.0 main branch source code release on AIX 7.1 using AIX
Toolkit packages for GCC and related packages -
(https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/aix-toolbox/alpha.html).
We have to use the AIX's linker (ld) as GCC's linker is not compatible with
AIX at this time. There is a limitation with AIX linker that causes an issue
with the build when compiling in 64 bit mode (using Python_64 2.7.15, and
-maix64 flags).
The settings I provided are:
    # export CC='gcc -lpthread -lm -lgcc -lgomp -lgfortran -maix64'
    # export LDFLAGS='-lpthread -lm -lgcc -lgomp -lgfortran -maix64'
    # export PATH=/opt/freeware/bin:$PATH
Once I run `python_64 setup.py install`, it would throw the following error
message:
    ld: 0706-012 The -p flag is not recognized.
    ld: 0706-012 The -a flag is not recognized.
    ld: 0706-012 The -t flag is not recognized.
    ld: 0706-012 The -h flag is not recognized.
    ld: 0706-012 The -= flag is not recognized.
    ld: 0706-012 The -/ flag is not recognized.
    collect2: error: ld returned 255 exit status
This is because within this command:
`/opt/freeware/lib64/python2.7/config/ld_so_aix /opt/freeware/bin/gfortran
-Wall -maix64 -g -bI:/opt/freeware/lib64/python2.7/config/python.exp -lpthread
-lm -lgcc -lgomp -lgfortran -maix64
build/temp.aix-7.1-2.7/scipy/integrate/_quadpackmodule.o -L/opt/OpenBLAS/lib
-L/opt/freeware/lib/gcc/powerpc-ibm-aix7.1.0.0/6.3.0/ppc64
-L/opt/freeware/lib64 -Lbuild/temp.aix-7.1-2.7 -Wl,-rpath="/opt/OpenBLAS/lib"
-lquadpack -lmach -lopenblas -lopenblas -lgfortran -o
build/lib.aix-7.1-2.7/scipy/integrate/_quadpack.so`, the specific flag -
`-Wl,-rpath="/opt/OpenBLAS/lib"` is not valid for AIX's `ld_so_aix` program.
I needed to include all the library flags in order for the linker to recognize
the libraries for OpenBLAS among other packages.
Please let me know if you need the full run log.
I will continue to investigate on how we can eliminate this particular flag
without breaking anything else.
Special thanks to the AIX Toolkit's team to help narrow this down a bit -

Update: Added LDFLAGS as I forgot to include that -- required for AIX to
recognize gomp and other packages when linking.
