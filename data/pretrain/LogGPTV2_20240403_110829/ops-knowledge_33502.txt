User: I have a simple .Net console app which has only framework dependencies. It can compile fine with either MSBuild on windows or Mono/XBuild on linux. It is part of a larger project, which has a python build script. Is there any simple way to determine the most suitable build engine (msbuild/xbuild) and use that?
In other words, I have a 'build.py' and I want that to call xbuild or msbuild as needed.
Assistant: Far easier would be to write a small shell script for Linux or OSX that ran xbuild but was called msbuild. The arguments are the same I think.
