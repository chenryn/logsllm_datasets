apps for one-on-one meetings between two parties, direct peer-to-peer connec-
tions are often used to carry the media packets. For meetings with more than two
participants, a client-server architecture is used, with a cloud-hosted media server
as the central point for collecting and distributing media packets for all partic-
ipants in the Zoom session. Furthermore, such a typical Zoom session involves
four logical connections: one TCP connection for control and management of the
session (including chat interactions), and three UDP connections, one for audio,
one for video, and one for screen sharing (if used). If the Zoom client is unable to
connect via the usual procedure, they are directed to use the Web client, which
uses TCP only.
To measure Zoom connections and client application usage on our campus, we
picked a representative day (Day2020) and examined transport protocol usage
based on the number of connections, as well as inbound and outbound data
traﬃc volumes. Table 5 shows this information. TCP accounts for only 1.67%
of outbound traﬃc, and 0.93% of inbound traﬃc, indicating that few people use
Web access to join meetings. Rather, they use the standard procedure of a Zoom
meeting connection using client applications.
For a typical Zoom meeting, a client should have three UDP connections for
every TCP connection. However, the results in Table 5 show that the number
of TCP connections is 15x larger than the number of UDP connections. There
are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, there might be network
connectivity or performance issues when users connect to Zoom from certain
subnets (e.g., WiFi), causing TCP problems. Second, there might be many short-
lived TCP connections for administrative management of Zoom sessions. We
explore both of these possibilities next.
Figure 11 provides evidence to support these hypotheses. The plot illustrates
the Log-Log Complementary Distribution (LLCD) function for Zoom connec-
tion durations. Considering the logarithmic scale of the y-axis, we can see a
rather signiﬁcant portion of TCP connections have small durations (under 30 s)
that cannot be attributed to typical meetings. UDP sessions tend to have longer

nections on 2020-09-23.
durations that reﬂect actual meetings, although the non-negligible portion of rel-
atively short-lived UDP sessions partly indicates the performance issues result-
ing in Zoom connection interruptions. Waiting rooms, a feature utilized in some
Zoom meetings, can also be another cause for the short-lived UDP sessions.
Figure 12 provides another perspective on Zoom session issues on our campus
network. It shows the hourly TCP traﬃc of Zoom connections on Day2020. Con-
nections with typical SYN-FIN handshakes as seen by our monitor are deemed
“Good”. During the peak hours of the day, only about half of the byte traﬃc
(note the log scale) is exchanged on Good TCP connections, implying that many
connections suﬀer when too many users on the same network connect to busy
Zoom servers. Note that the administrative machine-generated TCP connections
are short-lived with only a few kilobytes of traﬃc, which do not contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to overall traﬃc volume. Although this issue gives us insight into some
implications of online learning on our campus network, identifying its root cause
requires further investigation, which we leave as future work.
5.3 Zoom Session Management
To better understand Zoom sessions on our campus network, we have analyzed
Zoom server usage, as well as the administrative traﬃc generated between our
campus VPN server and the Zoom servers. These results are described next.
Figure 13 is a proﬁle-rank plot to show how connections and byte traﬃc
volumes are distributed across clients and Zoom servers. Figure 13(a) shows the
IP frequency-rank proﬁle for servers and clients on Day2020, as well as a year
later (Day2021: 2021-09-22). Figure 13(b) plots the corresponding IP volume-
rank proﬁle for those two days.
Several key insights emerge from these two graphs. First, in 2020, four client
IPs dominated the Zoom traﬃc, while connections are more widely distributed
among a larger set of IPs in 2021. This change reﬂects the presence of more
people on campus, with many using BYOD wireless devices. Second, the load
increase on Zoom’s servers is also evident in these graphs, both in connection
counts (2–3x) and traﬃc volume (1.5x). Third, although about 2,000 server IPs

are seen on a daily basis, most of the traﬃc is handled by only a couple hundred
servers. Furthermore, two stand out in the frequency-rank, reﬂecting roles in
Zoom session management for the campus network. Last but not least, the top
20 server IPs in frequency-rank do not contribute much traﬃc volume, imply-
ing the role of zone controllers, directing clients to selected Zoom Multimedia
Routers (MMRs). The main takeway here is that most of our campus Zoom traf-
ﬁc is handled by a relatively small set of Zoom servers, leading to possible load
issues on those servers. Zoom and other vendors need to provide more detailed
information in their client-side dashboard to assist with customer support7.
Within our own campus network, we have identiﬁed one speciﬁc server that
is directly involved in Zoom session management. This server has at least two
diﬀerent roles. First, it communicates with Zoom servers at the start of each new
hosted Zoom meeting to exchange a ﬁxed-size payload, which might be a certiﬁ-
cate or authentication credential for licensed users. Second, it generates ICMP
“port unreachable” messages to Zoom servers when a Zoom session is aborted,
or when an authenticated participant departs prematurely from a meeting. The
takeway message from these observations is that Zoom sessions are complex from
the network point of view, and induce extra administrative overhead.
6 Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on many aspects of people’s
lives over the past year. In this paper, we provide a detailed look at the network-
level eﬀects on inbound and outbound Internet usage on a large campus edge
network with over 30,000 users.
The main highlights from our study include the changes in the volume,
timing, and directionality of traﬃc. With fewer users on campus, we observed

mance of the Zoom server from the server’s perspective, and possibly tracking over

dramatic changes in the inbound and outbound traﬃc volumes, as well as a
reduction in the degree of asymmetry in the traﬃc. That is, inbound traﬃc
still dominates outbound, but not by as much as it did prior to the pandemic.
There are some perceptible diﬀerences in the daily timing of network usage, since
commuting to campus is no longer the norm. Furthermore, a geographic anal-
ysis of the authenticated users for our campus network shows an increasingly
international spread.
Pronounced shifts are also evident in network application usage. The
increased traﬃc volume for Zoom and Teams is dramatic (e.g., 20x–450x), and
VPN usage is also much higher (20x) than ever before. Most applications show
strong daily and weekly patterns, consistent with the normal workday sched-
ule, even when working from home. Research traﬃc seems less aﬀected by the
pandemic than teaching and learning traﬃc.
Finally, the results of our analysis reveal that there are issues with Zoom
TCP connections and session management on our campus network when many
people on campus connect to a limited set of regional Zoom servers during peak
hours [8]. These problems manifest themselves with a plethora of short-lived
TCP connections, and compromise the user-perceived quality of Zoom sessions.
Furthermore, these problems are likely to grow as UCalgary adopts a blended
learning model (i.e., a mix of in-person and online learning) in the upcoming
academic year.

Appendix
The monitor reconﬁguration mentioned earlier happened in the course of a week.
On July 6, 2020, we changed the reset interval from one hour to every three
hours to test the robustness of the monitor against the large volume of scanning
activity and how disabling the scanning module is eﬀective. The experiment was
successful, and on July 13, 2020, we again changed the reset interval to every six
hours. We then settled with that interval as our subsequent resource monitoring
suggested that a longer interval may cause problems.
Figure 14 shows the distribution of connection durations for ﬁve working
days from June 29 to July 3, 2020 (representing before reconﬁguration) and
another ﬁve working days from July 13 to July 17, 2020 (representing after
reconﬁguration). Both distributions follow a very similar pattern, with the post-
reconﬁguration graph stretching slightly to the right and longer tail on the LLCD
plot, showing a heavier tail for the distribution that attributes to the connec-
tions lasting between 1 to 6 h (note the log2-based x-axis). However, the most
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between these distributions (not evident in this ﬁgure)

is that more than 615 million connections were captured during these post-
reconﬁguration days, while this number for the pre-reconﬁguration days was
more than 570 million. There is about 45 million diﬀerence between the num-
ber of connections in these distributions, out of which only about 574 thousand
lasted between 1 to 6 h. It shows that the reconﬁguration not only helped in cap-
turing longer connections (which is very impactful for some applications, such
as Zoom and VPN) but also more connections in general, due to fewer restarts
per day.
