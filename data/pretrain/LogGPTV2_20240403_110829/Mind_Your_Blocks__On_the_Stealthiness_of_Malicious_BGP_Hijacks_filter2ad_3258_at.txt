the RPKI and ROAs could nevertheless be leveraged to prevent
unannounced IP address blocks from being hijacked by issuing
a ROA for AS0 and each unannounced IP address block
(such ROAs are already used to prevent the announcement of
reserved/unallocated IP space as dictated in RFC 6483 [24]).
Then, the RPKI will classify all routes for these IP address
blocks as invalid. This solution is not perfect though as it
requires a speciﬁc ROA to be issued when an IP address block
becomes unannounced which, in the case of orphan blocks, is
unlikely. Overall, the only proper solution to prevent BGP AS
path forgery and the AS hijacks we identiﬁed is to have secured
routed propagation, i.e., BGPsec, deployed. Unfortunately, this
solution is much more invasive and cannot be deployed without
substantial software and hardware updates on all routers.
Moreover, the standardisation process of BGPsec is not yet
completed and there is no router code available as of today.
Some vendors are working on it, or intending to work on it,
but some other vendors do not even list it on their roadmap.
VI. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSION
We conclude by providing concrete lessons that can be
leveraged to improve existing spam and BGP hijack mitigation
techniques and thwart these attacks.
Lesson 1: We have conﬁrmed the existence of BGP spec-
trum agility in the real-world in the form of stealthy and
persistent campaigns of malicious BGP hijacks.
Lesson 2: Today’s BGP hijack mitigation systems, such
as [1], [23], [24], [29], [40], are blind to hijacks of registered
though unannounced IP address space carried out by announc-
ing an IP address block using its valid BGP origin AS but via
an invalid upstream provider AS. The complete deployment
of BGPsec and ROA’s would prevent these attacks. In the
meantime, we would suggest BGP hijack detection systems to
include signatures for these hijacks based on the characteristics
we uncovered.
Lesson 3: Owners of unannounced IP address blocks leave
them vulnerable to hijacking. A best practice would be to
announce all blocks even if they are unused.
Lesson 4: A worldwide hunt for orphan IP address blocks
should be launched to prevent them from being hijacked and
further used for malicious purposes. Additionally, IP address
block owners that cease to exist or do not require the IP
resources anymore should (be forced to) return them. Keeping
IRR and RPKI data fresh is therefore key to prevent hijacks
of such IP address space.
Lesson 5: Uncovered hijacks involved many different IP
address blocks and origin ASes but very few invalid BGP
origin ASes and direct upstream provider ASes. This suggests
that ASes identiﬁed as invalid or malicious in previous hijacks
can be leveraged to identify subsequent hijacks or even block
trafﬁc from and to IP address blocks advertised via these ASes.
As future work we plan to expand the collaboration we
have recently initiated with CERTs, ISPs and the NANOG
and RIPE communities at large. A concrete outcome of these
ongoing discussions was the conﬁrmation that one of the ASes
found to be malicious by our system and responsible for
the hijack of 793 IP preﬁxes has seen his peering contract
terminated by its valid upstream ISP.
