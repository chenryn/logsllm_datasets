Reference: [Travis CI Build #392640200](https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/builds/392640200)

It appears that the build is failing due to pending deprecation warnings. Specifically, the error message indicates:

```
AssertionError: Got warnings when calling fit: 
[
  {
    "message": "PendingDeprecationWarning: The matrix subclass is not the recommended way to represent matrices or deal with linear algebra (see https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html). Please adjust your code to use regular ndarray.",
    "category": "PendingDeprecationWarning"
  }
]
```

To resolve this issue, you should update the code to use `ndarray` instead of the `matrix` subclass, as recommended by the NumPy documentation.
