### Convert a Dynamic Disk to a Basic Disk

This command converts an empty dynamic disk to a basic disk. You must first select a dynamic disk using the `select disk` command and shift the focus to it for this operation to succeed.

#### Important
- The disk must be empty to convert it to a basic disk.
- Ensure you back up your data before proceeding.
- Delete all partitions or volumes on the disk before converting it.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
convert basic [noerr]
```

#### Parameters
- **noerr**: (For scripting only) When an error is encountered, DiskPart will continue to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

#### Examples
To convert the selected dynamic disk to a basic disk, type:
```plaintext
convert basic
```

#### Additional Information
For detailed instructions on how to use this command, refer to the documentation on [Changing a Dynamic Disk Back to a Basic Disk](#).
