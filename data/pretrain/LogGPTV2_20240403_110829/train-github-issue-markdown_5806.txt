# Description
The documentation page (https://pypi.org/project/celery/) has four broken
links to webpages/documents. All links are to pages/documents that are no
longer there. 404 errors are returned:
  * Web link at the top of the page  
Get Started section:
  * First Steps with Celery
  * Next Steps  
Documentation Section:
  * Latest Documentation
# Suggestions
Please fix those links so that both documents render as expected. As a
developer completely new to Celery these missing documents leave quite a gap.
Thanks in advance for your support and maintaining this library. I look
forward to learning what Celery can do and making the most of it.
