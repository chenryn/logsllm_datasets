I don't know how I've only discovered these methods now ðŸ˜„ but anyway...
Would an app get rejected by the MAS if it used `app.setLoginItemSettings` for
example? The Mac App Store submission guide doesn't list it as a limitation
but I would assume that it isn't MAS-friendly. Although, it would be _great_
if it was compatible. I guess it depends on how it's implemented underneath
(i.e. whether it reaches out of the sandbox or not, etc.)
