Who We Are
We take pride in our junk drawers.
Crazy ideas are encouraged.
We can't tell you everything but you can still ask.
You simulate it - we build it.
Our mess is a sign of work in progress.
Our toolbox contains more than just MATLAB.
No device is safe from disassembly.
We love what we do.

Deﬁnitions
✴Hardware Trojan: malicious alteration of hardware, that 
could, under speciﬁc conditions, result in functional changes 
of the system.
✴Time Bomb Trojan disables a system at some future time.
✴Data Exﬁltration Trojan leaks conﬁdential information over 
a secret channel.

HOST 2008 Workshop, Anaheim, California, USA
Why is it a threat?
✴Electronics plays an 
important role in:
✴Storage and communication 
of conﬁdential information
✴Management and control of 
important equipment
✴Critical national security 
applications and systems
✴ Because of globalization, chip design and fabrication 
are increasingly vulnerable to malicious alterations.
What can be altered?
HDL
Source
Code
Circuit Diagram
IC Layout
FPGAs
✴ Deﬁnition: An FPGA is a 
semiconductor device 
containing programmable 
logic components and 
programmable interconnects. 
✴ To conﬁgure ("program") an 
FPGA you specify how you 
want the chip to work with a 
logic circuit diagram or a 
source code using a 
hardware description 
language (HDL).

✴Application
✴AES Encryption engine
✴Hardware
✴Spartan 3E FPGA Board
✴PS2 Keyboard (user input)
✴LCD Display (Cipher output)
✴Trojan
✴Once triggered by a request to 
encrypt a special keyword, we
transmit AES key on a covert 
communication channel.

Trojan Demonstrations
✴Thermal
✴ An external resistor is electrically modulated creating thermal 
emission. 
✴ The micro-controller, or other parts of the circuit are quickly 
saturated with operations, creating thermal emission.
✴ The thermal signal is sensed using an IR camera.
✴Optical
✴ An external LED is electrically modulated at a rate undetectable 
by human eye.
✴ The optical signal is sensed using an optical-to-audio ampliﬁer.
✴Radio
✴ An external I/O pin is modulated causing radio emission.
✴ The radio signal is sensed using radio receiver and post-
processing received signal on PC.

Conclusion
✴Hardware Trojans are a new and emerging 
threat.
✴Systems at risk include military systems, 
ﬁnancial systems and even household 
appliances.
✴The purpose of our work is to demonstrate the 
dangers of Hardware Trojans.
✴We are also working on Trojan detection 
schemes.
