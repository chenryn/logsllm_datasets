Question: An organization is planning to implement a secure communication system using Bluetooth technology for its Apple devices. They require a system that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, along with resistance to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Given that the organization's devices support Bluetooth 4.1 and later, which of the following security features should be included in the system's design to meet these requirements?
"A": "Pairing using P-256 elliptic curve and AES-CMAC algorithms",
"B": "Bonding with pairing information stored in a secure location on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS devices",
"C": "Message integrity ensured by AES-CCM cryptography",
"D": "Use of RSA_AES ciphers for encryption to disable forward secrecy"
Answer: ABC
