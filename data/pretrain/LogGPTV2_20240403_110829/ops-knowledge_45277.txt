User: Will it continue the code after it's run? Or will it stop at that line until the script is done?
Assistant: You can use os.system or subprocess.Popen or subprocess.call but when using subprocess methods make sure you use shell=True. And executing it via system call in all these methods is blocking. The python script will complete and then go the next step.
