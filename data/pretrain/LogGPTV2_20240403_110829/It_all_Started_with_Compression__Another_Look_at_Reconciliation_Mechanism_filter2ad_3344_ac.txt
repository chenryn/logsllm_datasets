conflict could lead many to compromise with former abusers and to grant them am-
nesty”. From the 26 case studies, Sriram noted that the level of accountability that 
can be attained by transitional regimes is more a function of the international con-
text and balance of forces than the nature of past abuses which has “largely anecdotal 
evidence” to support it. She concluded that one general lesson from the dilemmas 
that transitional regimes face is that there is a continuum of options with no defini-
tive one “right” answer. Also, that generalisations are impossible with any certainty 
on what type of transitional situation results in what level of accountability “because 
each State has a distinct history, culture and set of political problems” (p. 102). 
In “Reflections on the Abidjan Peace Accord”, Bangura (1997:217–241) identi-
fied some of the positive gains of the Accord of December 1996 ending the five and 
half year civil war in Sierra Leone, but also the potential dangers or “vital omis-
sions” which included the failure to provide a time-frame for the various aspects of 
1
A m a d u   S e s a y
the Peace Commission, the problem of atrocities – visible and widespread – during 
the war years, and the huge costs of the war. Apart from these points, the Accord 
was criticized for granting RUF leaders absolute immunity from any prosecution 
for war-related crimes, its silence on the rights and interests of women, its lack of 
reference to other critical actors in the war, especially the Kamajors. Also, in spite 
of the laudable goals of equity, grassroots participation and the anti-poverty thrust 
of the Accord, no attempt was made to address the problems which the neo-liberal 
paradigm of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund was likely to 
create for the implementation of specific provisions- especially the socio-economic 
plan as contained in Article 26. Finally, as Bangura noted, the Peace Accord omits 
to specify what would happen in the event of a deadlock between the arms of the 
proposed Peace Commission (p. 236–240). This last point is particularly instructive 
given the fact that eventually, the SLTRC and the Special Court set up to try those 
responsible for the most heinous war crimes, were at loggerheads with each other 
especially on jurisdictional and procedural matters. 
Karen Lundwall (2001) rightly noted that research on the psychological effects 
of wars and their aftermaths, despite the atrocities that mark them over a prolonged 
period, is still in its infancy. According to her, whereas reconciliations attempted 
through  truth  commissions  are  popular  at  the  societal  level,  they  could  have  an 
effect at the personal level as well; hence the increasing interest in what the psy-
chological literature has to say regarding violence, its development, effects, and the 
possibilities of prevention and reconciliation. In this regard, she noted the growing 
scholarly and public policy interests in reconciliation as a measure for the prevention 
of further conflicts against the backdrop of the vicious cycles of war, countries that 
resolve conflicts peacefully are inclined to continue living in peace.
Avruch and Vejarano (2002:31–76) insisted that truth commissions, more than 
20 since 1973, mostly united by having the word “truth” somewhere in their titles, 
nevertheless  demonstrate  great  diversity  in  terms  of  their  socio-political  settings, 
levels of support (international, governmental, popular), resources and constraints, 
and their varying degrees of success (pp. 37–38). They identified five problematic 
areas of such commissions as: the problem of justice; problem of truth; problem of 
reconciliation; problem of democratisation; and finally, the often-ignored problem 
of  culture  (p.  38).  For  instance,  on  justice,  they  argued  that  truth  commissions 
cannot  by  their  nature  deliver  on  justice  involving  criminal  proceedings  against 
perpetrators of violence. They also cannot establish the correct facts on a matter 
or render verdicts or punishment. This, according to them, explains why there is 
less focus on criminal justice in favour of “quasi-justice forms” such as “transitional 
justice”, “restorative justice” or “retroactive justice”, to mention a few (p. 31). The 
problem of truth, on the other hand, arises from “the complexity and multiplicity of 
truth” since different sides have their own versions of the history and truth of what 
1
D o e s   O n e   S i z e   F i t   A l l ?
really happened (p. 39). What these differences clearly point to, is that the notions 
underlying truth commissions are still heavily contested. 
There is substantive controversy, not just on the role of the international com-
munity but also on the duration of their involvement in countries making the dif-
ficult transition from war to peace. Aspects of the latter controversy were brought 
to the fore in the 2004 Report of the International Crisis Group (ICG) on Liberia 
and Sierra Leone titled “Rebuilding Failed States” which proposed that the interna-
tional community needs to make genuinely long-term commitments of between 15 
and 25 years in order to enable new political forces to develop and mature in post-
war countries. In the case of the two countries, the ICG argued that interventions 
are failing to produce states that will be stable and capable of exercising sovereign 
responsibilities. This is because in their traditional format of troop deployment for 
peace-keeping, DDR, elections, etc., external interventions treat peace building ef-
forts as implementing an operational checklist, involving fixes to various institu-
tions and processes within a compressed time-frame, without tackling underlying 
political dynamics. In the light of this, the ICG identified what it considered to be 
the four major objectives that the international community must pursue vigorously 
in countries emerging from prolonged civil wars. These are: donors must make good 
their financial/technical commitments to post-war reconstruction projects; make a 
long-term commitment towards assuring minimal security, not of 2–5 years but of 
15–25 years; return political control and responsibility more quickly to local actors  
– a “radical retreat” accompanied by an equally radical intrusion into the economic 
area, especially through managing revenue collection for a considerable period of 
time (ICG 2004:2–3).
Rosalind  Shaw  (2005)  described  the  SLTRC  as  a  “standard  part  of  conflict 
resolution “first-aid kits”, even though there was clear preference for a “forgive and 
forget” approach deriving from local strategies of recovery and reintegration (p. 1). 
Put differently, she noted that the SLTRC valorised a particular kind of memory 
practice: “truth telling” based, unfortunately, on problematic assumptions about the 
purported universal benefits of verbally remembering violence. In her view, the “ide-
as concerning the conciliatory and therapeutic efficacy of truth telling are the prod-
uct of western culture of memory… truth commissions do not constitute therapy”  
(p. 2). On why the majority of Sierra Leone people want to “forgive and forget”, 
Shaw argued that apart from fear of retaliation by perpetrators, fear of government 
reprisal and concerns arising from the concurrent operation of different transitional 
justice mechanisms such as the Special Court alongside the TRC, a fourth critical 
issue hardly recognised and addressed was the country’s deeper historical legacy of 
violence and its linkage to the development of grassroots practices of social recov-
ery. 
Shaw (2005) also acknowledged the material dimension of truth-telling vis-à-
vis the fact that many of those who testified before the SLTRC ended up by appeal-
1
A m a d u   S e s a y
ing for economic assistance (p. 7). She argued that the citizens did not wait for the 
TRC before working to rebuild their lives and social communities – most especially 
by adapting long used local techniques of healing, reintegration and reconciliation 
(with NGOs and religious groups). There is also a prevalence of what Shaw called 
“social forgetting”, as a different process from individual forgetting involving “a re-
fusal to reproduce the violence by talking about it publicly” (p. 7). Accordingly, such 
a  process  of  social  forgetting  “unmakes”  past  violence  and  “remakes”  ex-combat-
ants as new social persons. Yet, although the practice enables and sustains ongoing 
processes of healing and social recovery to take place, it should not be taken as an 
absolute panacea (p. 8). Also, if care is not taken, a TRC could serve a “destructive” 
end in the context where survivors of violence want some form of retributive justice 
against perpetrators which is not the case in Sierra Leone. 
Dougherty (2004:1–19) examines critical elements germane to the establish-
ment of the SLTRC, including its controversial relationship with the Special Court. 
Again deriving from Priscilla Hayner’s comparative insights on truth commissions 
as a process, encompassing public engagement, full participation of stakeholders and 
the supportiveness of the truth commissions to victims and survivors; as a product, 
through their public hearings and written reports evaluated in terms of the quality 
and nature of the product, the extent of truth revealed, proposals and recommenda-
tions for reform and accountability; and finally, impact, focusing on truth commis-
sions’ contributions to long-term healing, reconciliation and reform (p. 2). 
Phuong Pham et. al (2004:602–612) examined the implications of trauma and 
PTSD for attitudes towards justice and reconciliation after the Rwandan genocide 
where 10 per cent of that country’s population of 7.7 million died during the first 
few days of war in July 1999. Acknowledging the implementation of a new judicial 
programme, Gacaca building on a tradition local dispute mechanism, Pham et al. ar-
gued that despite the activities of the different judicial responses, their tangible con-
tributions to the process of reconciliation are not sufficiently known. According to 
them, reconciliation is a process whereby individuals, social groups and institutions: 
(1) develop a shared vision and sense of collective future (“community”); (2) estab-
lish mutual ties and obligations across lines of social demarcation and ethnic groups 
(“interdependence”); (3) come to accept and actively promote individual rights, rule 
of law, tolerance of social diversity, and equality of opportunity (“social justice”); 
and  (4)  adopt  non-violent  alternatives  to  conflict  management  (“non-violence”)  
(p. 604). In conclusion, Pham and his collaborators argued that the“relationship of 
judicial trials to reconciliation cannot be assumed, nor can we assume that all trau-
ma survivors necessarily see justice in the same way”. Besides this, their Rwandan 
data indicated that “openness to reconciliation is related to multiple other personal 
and environmental factors that must be considered in developing policies for peace 
building in societies that are emerging from mass violence” (p. 611–612).

It is clear from this brief review of some of the literature that though popular 
lately, TRCs could equally be controversial. For example, it is apparent in the litera-
ture that a lot is expected from truth commissions not only in the Sierra Leonean 
situation,  but  also  in  other  countries  where  the  mechanism  has  been/was  put  in 
place after long years of violence. What has not been properly addressed, however, 
and again, particularly in the Sierra Leonean case, is the extent to which the high 
expectations from truth commissions contained in the literature can be achieved in 
a small country like Sierra Leone, which is still under what I can call “international 
receivership” or what Rosalind Shaw describes as “UN-ization” and NGO-ization. 
This is extremely doubtful and constitutes the focus of part six of this essay (Shaw 
2005).
Various definitions of what constitutes reconciliation have been suggested in 
the literature. According to Karen Brouneus at Sida 
Reconciliation is a social process that involves mutual acknowledgement of past suf-
fering and the changing of destructive attitudes and behaviour into constructive re-
lationships toward sustainable peace…In other words, reconciliation mainly focuses 
on remembering, changing, and continuing with life in peace. Reconciliation does 
not require forgetting, forgiving or loving one another (Sida 2003).
And from the viewpoint of the Catholic Relief Services, CARITAS, 
reconciliation refers to restoring the right relationships between people who have 
been alienated and separated from each other during conflict. Reconciliation occurs 
not only in relationships, but also at the spiritual, personal, social, structural and 
ecological  levels  (CARITAS,  www.crs.org/our_work/what_wedo/programmes-ar-
eas/peacebuilding/definitions.cfm).
From such perceptions, it is arguable that reconciliation takes place when two par-
ties, individuals, communities, groups, etc, within a given country or entity that 
once perceived each other as “enemies” openly “forgive” one another for past wrong-
doing. In the particular case of Sierra Leone, it is plausible to say that reconciliation 
would  have  been  achieved  if  former  members  of  the  RUF,  the  AFRC,  Kamajors 
(perpetrators) on the one hand, apologized for their transgressions and victims, on 
the other, embrace them openly. 
In her study of Cuba, Holly Ackerman identified six steps in the reconciliation 
process. First, is “reconciliation as an event”, and she argues that reconciliation is like 
a journey, it starts with a single step, “divided factions literally meet and sit together 
for the first time in an effort to begin to exchange views and initiate a process of ac-
commodation on past differences…”. In step two, reconciliation is seen as involving 
the “dissolution of conflicting identities”, a process that is perhaps similar to that in 
South Africa, where apartheid, a racist system, for many years separated whites and 
blacks was dismantled in the 1990s with the hope for a “new” South Africa in which 
skin colour would not be the basis of interpersonal relationships, access to opportu-
21
A m a d u   S e s a y
nities, etc. Ackerman noted however, that in “order to achieve this [desired] social 
conversion, individuals and institutions must recognize their past mistakes, and set 
out on a new path”. The third step on the reconciliation road is facilitating “mutual 
coexistence among distinct groups”, and it involves “building respect for differences, 
communicating across differences and celebrating unique ways of being”. 
The fourth phase is “reconciliation as individual moral evolution”, and it “in-
volves confession, repentance, atonement and forgiveness…it is a model (of recon-
ciliation) based on individual transformation” . In the fifth stage, reconciliation is 
effected through the instrumentality of the “rule of law via effective guarantees of 
human rights”. The main concern in this phase is establishing the “truth of past 
human rights violations and …installing a more effective rule of law to protect the 
restored balance”. Finally, reconciliation can be conceived of as “community build-
ing”, the centrepiece of which is “interdependence”. The nation has been divided 
because significant numbers of citizens have ceased to see that collective well-being 
depends upon mutual respect” (Ackerman 1999:342–43). However for this proc-
ess to succeed, “there must be truth telling as well as a sense of community among 
the citizens who would resolve to bury their differences in the interest of building 
a united nation”. Also, the targets of reunion should de-emphasize all those things 
that tend to divide them and to accentuate those that unite them in the interest of 
national peace and peaceful co-existence.
In terms of conceptualisation, Lundwall (2001:23–25) noted that there is little 
critical discussion in the literature regarding, and defining, the term reconciliation, 
except perhaps for the definition proposed by the Centre for the Study of Violence 
and Reconciliation in South Africa, which identified five critical issues in recon-
ciliation. According to her, reconciliation has a non-racial ideological connotation; 
reconciliation as an ideology for bridging gaps between separate communities; the 
religious ideology of reconciliation which emphasizes forgiveness; reconciliation as a 
human rights approach to regulating and preventing violations of rights from hap-
pening again; and finally, reconciliation as a form of community building. She drew 
on the four characteristics of truth commissions described by Priscilla Hayner, that 
they: focus on the past and investigate the pattern of abuses over a period of time, 
not a particular event; are a temporary body that completes its work with an official 
report; are officially sanctioned, in order to assure the accessibility of information; 
and that their recommendations are taken seriously.
What is obvious, then, is that there is no widely accepted technical or popular 
definition of reconciliation, in spite of the recent “boom” in academic interest and 
actual processes. According to Lundwall the difficulty in adequately defining recon-
ciliation derives in part from whether it is at the level of society or the individual vic-
tim. According to her, quite often, the goal of truth commissions is to promote rec-
onciliation on a national level – whereas at the individual level, issues such as healing 
and reconciliation are deeply personal processes. Again, this is so since there is no 
22
D o e s   O n e   S i z e   F i t   A l l ?
guarantee that knowledge of the whole truth will lead to a survivor’s reconciliation 
with his or her perpetrator. Thus, Lundwall sees reconciliation as “the formation of 
lasting peace on both societal and individual levels…involving different processes 
but striving towards a common goal: to facilitate coexistence…not by forgetting or 
altruistic  forgiveness,  but  by  verbalising  and  acknowledging  a  violent,  conflictive 
past”. Yet, Lundwall left many unanswered questions which she agreed form part 
of the “important and inspiring challenges for the twenty-first century”, including: 
What  is  perceived  as  reconciliation  among  different  people  who  experience/have 
experienced intractable conflict? What psychological mechanisms are involved in 
healing and reconciliation? How can individual tendencies towards accepting rec-
onciliation be measured? What factors facilitate and promote reconciliation within 
individuals and within societies? What are the psychological effects of participating 
as a victim, witness, perpetrator, or commissioner in truth commissions, etc? 
Consequently, while each of the definitions and expositions presented here has 
some merit, especially in the realm of theory, it is not so certain if they would work 
when put to the test in post conflict societies embarking on the delicate and un-
certain road to reconciliation, reconstruction and peace building. It is significant 
to also note that the definitions presented here implicitly or explicitly refer to post 
hostility/post conflict situations, and bringing together once more, individuals and 
groups that had been separated from each other and/or alienated as a result of con-
flict and war. Thus, for the purpose of this study, post conflict reconciliation should 
be seen as an impromptu attempt by individuals and local communities, supported 
by the international community, to put the past behind them and bring erstwhile 
enemies or opponents together in a way that would heal the wounds resulting from 
long years of war, atrocities and impunity, such as was the case in Sierra Leone. It is 
perceived that only after reconciliation has been accomplished would the post con-
flict peace and stability that are required to jump-start and fast-track the process of 
rebuilding the state, commence. Finally, reconciliation traverses the whole gamut of 
post conflict activities to include socio-economic reconstruction, peace building and 
political reform, including opening up the political space for popular participation. 
From the foregoing discussion, there is no doubt that post conflict reconcilia-
tion is a complex, delicate, even uncertain process. It requires the active involvement 
of  everyone  in  the  society:  perpetrators,  victims,  and  guarantors  of  peace  agree-
ments. It would also require putting in place novel socio-economic programmes, 
institutions and structures designed to address not only those background factors 
and issues that gave rise to the conflict in the first place, but also to take advantage of 
new opportunities, in the post conflict society. However, the success or failure of the 
reconciliation process itself would very much depend on several critical factors both 
internal and external to the post conflict society/state. First, would be the presence 
or absence of local capacity to see the processes of reconciliation through in all their 
ramifications. Second, is the extent of the damage caused to the national economy 
23
A m a d u   S e s a y
and social infrastructure, resulting from the war. That is, whether national infra-
structure was extensively damaged or if atrocities were widespread, thereby causing 
extensive trauma among the local population. Third, it is important to find out if 
the war left deep rooted physical scars on segments of the population, i.e. large num-
bers of amputees and victims of sexual violence, as is the case in Sierra Leone, etc. 
Fourth and closely related to the previous points are the circumstances and nature of 
the affected state and its ability to stand by and large on its own feet, after the hos-
tilities. I would argue that the more the state is able to take quick ownership of the 
reconciliation processes unaided, the more autonomous resources it commands, the 
more comprehensive and successful would the post bellum reconciliation become.  
This is an important point because the ownership, pace and even the degree 
of success of the national reconciliation processes may well be a function of how 
autonomous the state is at the end of hostilities. For instance, while extensive and 
horrendous damage was done in South Africa by several decades of apartheid and 
armed struggle, the country was nonetheless able to embark on the long road to na-
tional reconciliation almost completely under its own steam. Yes, external agencies 
and friendly states did contribute to the process, but there was never a doubt that the 
South African government and state were in full control, the owners and drivers of 
the process.1 It is also important to note that the apartheid years created world class
