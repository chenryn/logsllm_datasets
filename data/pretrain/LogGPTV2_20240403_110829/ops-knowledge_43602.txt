User: I have an application written in Python that's writing large amounts of data to the %TEMP% folder.  Oddly, every once and awhile, it dies, returning IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device.  The drive has plenty of free space, %TEMP% is not its own partition, I'm an administrator, and the system has no quotas.
Does Windows artificially put some types of limits on the data in %TEMP%?  If not, any ideas on what could be causing this issue?
EDIT: Following discussions below, I clarified the question to better explain what's going on.
Assistant: There shouldn't be such space limitation in Temp.  If you wrote the app, I would recommend creating your files in ProgramData...
