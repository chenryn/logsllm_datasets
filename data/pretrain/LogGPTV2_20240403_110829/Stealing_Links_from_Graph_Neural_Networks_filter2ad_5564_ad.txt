the attack model’s last hidden layer’s output (32-dimension)
for positive node pairs and negative node pairs and project
them into a 2-dimension space using t-Distributed Stochas-
tic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [61]. Figure 3a shows the
results for Citeseer when using Cora as the shadow dataset,
both of which are citation datasets. We can see that the posi-
tive (negative) node pairs from both the target dataset and the
shadow dataset can be clustered into similar position, which
indicates the positive (negative) node pairs from both datasets
have similar distributions. This means if the attack model
learns a decision boundary to separate positive nodes pairs
from the negative node pairs on the shadow dataset, this deci-
sion boundary can be easily carried over to the target dataset.
In contrast, Figure 3b shows the results for ENZYMES (a
chemical dataset) when using Cora (a citation dataset) as the
shadow dataset. We see that the positive (negative) node pairs
from the shadow dataset and the target dataset are distributed
differently in the 2-dimension space. For example, the positive
node pairs for Cora are clustered into the outer space of the
circle area whereas the positive node pairs for ENZYMES are
clustered into the inner space of the circle area. Therefore, it
is hard for the adversary to perform an effective transferring
attack. The underlying reason for this to happen is that graphs
from the same domain have analogous graph structures and
similar features. This leads to less information loss for our
transferring attack.
Attack-2: K = (F ,×,×). In Attack-2, the adversary has the
knowledge of the target dataset’s nodes’ attributes. As dis-
cussed in Section 4, she trains a reference model g by herself
from F . We compare four types of information mentioned
in Section 4, and the results are shown in Figure 4. Note that

we only show the results calculated with Correlation distance
out of the 8 distance metrics (Table 13) since Correlation dis-
tance achieves the best performance in almost all settings. We
can see that in all chemical datasets and one citation dataset,
using the distance of target dataset’s nodes’ attributes leads
to the best performance. For the other two citation datasets,
using the distance between posteriors of the target model can
get better performance. Nodes’ attributes’ dimensions are
higher in citation datasets than in chemical datasets. In other
words, the node attributes for citation datasets are sparser.
For instance, we observe that most attributes are 0 in cita-
tion datasets. Therefore, we conclude that the attack can get

better performance using the Correlation distance between
posteriors of the target model when the target dataset’s nodes’
attributes are in high dimension.
Attack-3: K = (×,A∗,×). Table 6 shows the results for
this attack. With the knowledge of the target dataset’s partial
graph, the average AUC score for all cases is over 0.9. Com-
pared to Attack-2, the AUC scores on chemical datasets have
an improvement over 10% and the AUC scores on citation
datasets have an improvement over 2%.4
Compared to Attack-1 and Attack-2, Attack-3 achieves the
best performance, this indicates the target dataset’s partial
graph is the most important component for an adversary for
performing a link stealing attack. The reason is that the partial
graph contains the ground truth links in the target dataset,
which can be directly exploited by the attack model.
We further investigate the contribution of each feature set
to the ﬁnal prediction following the methodology of Dong
et al. [16]. Concretely, when studying one feature set, we set
other features’ value to 0. As shown in Figure 5, the features
extracted by applying pairwise operation over posteriors are
most useful for the ﬁnal prediction, followed by the features
based on posteriors with different distance metrics. We note
that our attack also achieves over 0.70 AUC on average when
only using pairwise operation over entropy of posteriors as
features. Moreover, our attack achieves the best performance
when taking all the three feature sets together, which implies
the combination of different features indeed improves the
overall performance.
Attack-4: K = (×,A∗,D(cid:48)). Table 7 shows the results for
Attack-4. First, compared to Attack-1 (K = (×,×,D(cid:48))), the
overall performance of Attack-4 improves with the help of
target dataset’s partial graph A∗. This is reasonable since the
target dataset’s partial graph contains some ground truth links
from the target dataset. Second, we note that the performances
of Attack-4 are worse than Attack-3 (K = (×,A∗,×)). Intu-
itively, the performance should be better since Attack-4 has
more background knowledge. The reason for the performance
degradation is that we do not take the pairwise vector opera-
tion (Table 14) over posteriors as the input for Attack-4 since
we want to learn information from both the target dataset
and the shadow dataset, and need to eliminate the dimension
mismatch issue (as discussed in Section 4). Moreover, the

results also indicate that compared to the shadow dataset, the
target dataset’s partial graph is more informative.
Attack-5: K = (F ,×,D(cid:48)). In Attack-5, the adversary has
the knowledge of target dataset’s nodes’ attributes as well
as a shadow dataset, evaluation results are shown in Table 8.
We observe that Attack-5 performs better than both Attack-
1 (only with D(cid:48)) and Attack-2 (only with F ). This shows
the combination of F and D(cid:48) can lead to a better link steal-
ing performance. Furthermore, we observe similar trends as
for Attack-1, that is the attack performs better if the shadow
dataset comes from the same domain as the target dataset.
Attack-6: K = (F ,A∗,×). The result of Attack-6 on all
datasets is shown in Table 10. We can see that for almost
all datasets (except ENZYMES), the AUC scores are over
0.95, which means this attack achieves an excellent perfor-
mance. In particular, the AUC score is nearly 1 on PRO-
TEINS_full. Moreover, Attack-6 consistently outperforms
Attack-2 (K = (F ,×,×)). This further validates the effec-
tiveness of A∗ in helping the adversary to infer links. Another
ﬁnding is that for chemical datasets, the information of target
dataset’s partial graph brings a larger improvement than the
citation datasets. One possible explanation is that the nodes’
attributes in chemical datasets contain less information (they
are in lower dimension), thus the target dataset’s partial graph
contributes more to the ﬁnal prediction performance.
Attack-7: K = (F ,A∗,D(cid:48)). The results of Attack-7 are sum-
marized in Table 9. Compared to Attack-5 (K = (F ,×,D(cid:48))),
the overall performances improve with the help of A∗. We
would expect the adversary’s accuracy is better than that of
Attack-6 (K = (F ,A∗,×)) since she has more background
knowledge. However, we observe that the performance drops
from Attack-6 to Attack-7. We suspect this is due to the fact
that we want to learn information from both the target dataset
and the shadow dataset, to avoid the dimension mismatch
