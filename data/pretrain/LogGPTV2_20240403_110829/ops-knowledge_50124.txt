User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Internet security demonstration of TLS for laypeople? I'm trying to plan a demonstration for my young students about SSL/TLS and how HTTPS works. Is there any tool around to help my purpose?

The students will be adults who know nothing about Internet Security. Therefore I'm not looking for a deep academic approach to the subject but a general touch of it covering such aspects as, what it is, how it works and why it is important. Instead of just talking and presenting it to them, I would like to know if I could also use a tool or something to demonstrate practically its use.

Assistant: Do what amounts to be a "magic trick". Set up:


a web server with a basic login page and a file upload feature
a client machine with a web browser for a student to use
a sniffing machine


Get the user to log in with any username and a fake password, make a Word file (or similar) with a message and upload it. 

Use the sniffing machine to discover the password and save the Word file and read the message. All of this is scriptable on the sniffing machine. 

Then you explain the magic trick, show them the password string in the capture, then turn on TLS and show them the encrypted text.
