### System info
  * Playwright Version: 1.30.0
  * Operating System: windows 10
  * Browser: firefox, chromium
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Config file**
    // playwright.config.ts
    import type { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test'
    const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
        use: {
            trace: 'on'
        },
    }
    export default config
**Test file (self-contained)**
    import { test } from '@playwright/test'
    test('page loads', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('https://google.com')
        await page.waitForSelector('/')
    })
**Steps**
  * run test
  * run `playwright show-trace` with the path to the trace file or upload it to trace.playwright.dev
**Expected**
trace file loads, with some sort of handling on the step with the invalid
selector
**Actual**
blank screen with errors in the console:
