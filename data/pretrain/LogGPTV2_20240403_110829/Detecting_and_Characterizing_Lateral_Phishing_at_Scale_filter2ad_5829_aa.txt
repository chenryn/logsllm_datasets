Abstract
We present the ﬁrst large-scale characterization of lateral
phishing attacks, based on a dataset of 113 million employee-
sent emails from 92 enterprise organizations. In a lateral
phishing attack, adversaries leverage a compromised enter-
prise account to send phishing emails to other users, beneﬁt-
ting from both the implicit trust and the information in the
hijacked user’s account. We develop a classiﬁer that ﬁnds hun-
dreds of real-world lateral phishing emails, while generating
under four false positives per every one-million employee-
sent emails. Drawing on the attacks we detect, as well as a
corpus of user-reported incidents, we quantify the scale of lat-
eral phishing, identify several thematic content and recipient
targeting strategies that attackers follow, illuminate two types
of sophisticated behaviors that attackers exhibit, and estimate
the success rate of these attacks. Collectively, these results
expand our mental models of the ‘enterprise attacker’ and
shed light on the current state of enterprise phishing attacks.
1 Introduction
For over a decade, the security community has explored a
myriad of defenses against phishing attacks. Yet despite this
long line of work, modern-day attackers routinely and suc-
cessfully use phishing attacks to compromise government
systems, political ﬁgures, and companies spanning every eco-
nomic sector. Growing in prominence each year, this genre
of attacks has risen to the level of government attention, with
the FBI estimating $12.5 billion in ﬁnancial losses worldwide
from 78,617 reported incidents between October 2013 to May
2018 [12], and the US Secretary of Homeland Security declar-
ing that phishing represents “the most devastating attacks by
the most sophisticated attackers” [39].
By and large, the high-proﬁle coverage around targeted
spearphishing attacks against major entities, such as Google,
RSA, and the Democratic National Committee, has captured
and shaped our mental models of enterprise phishing at-
tacks [35, 43, 46]. In these newsworthy instances, as well
as many of the targeted spearphishing incidents discussed in
the academic literature [25, 26, 28], the attacks come from
external accounts, created by nation-state adversaries who
cleverly craft or spoof the phishing account’s name and email
address to resemble a known and legitimate user. However,
in recent years, work from both industry [7, 24, 36] and
academia [6, 18, 32, 41] has pointed to the emergence and
growth of lateral phishing attacks: a new form of phishing
that targets a diverse range of organizations and has already
incurred billions of dollars in ﬁnancial harm [12]. In a lateral
phishing attack, an adversary uses a compromised enterprise
account to send phishing emails to a new set of recipients.
This attack proves particularly insidious because the attacker
automatically beneﬁts from the implicit trust in the hijacked
account: trust from both human recipients and conventional
email protection systems.
Although recent work [10, 15, 18, 19, 41] presents several
ideas for detecting lateral phishing, these prior methods either
require that organizations possess sophisticated network mon-
itoring infrastructure, or they produce too many false positives
for practical usage. Moreover, no prior work has characterized
this attack at a large, generalizable scale. For example, one
of the most comprehensive related work uses a multi-year
dataset from one organization, which only contains two lat-
eral phishing attacks [18]. This state of affairs leaves many
important questions unanswered: How should we think about
this class of phishing with respect to its scale, sophistication,
and success? Do attackers follow thematic strategies, and
can these common behaviors fuel new or improved defenses?
How are attackers capitalizing on the information within the
hijacked accounts, and what does their behavior say about the
state and trajectory of enterprise phishing attacks?
In this joint work between academia and Barracuda Net-
works we take a ﬁrst step towards answering these open ques-
tions and understanding lateral phishing at scale. This paper
seeks to both explore avenues for practical defenses against
this burgeoning threat and develop accurate mental models
for the state of these phishing attacks in the wild.
First, we present a new classiﬁer for detecting URL-based
lateral phishing emails and evaluate our approach on a dataset
of 113 million emails, spanning 92 enterprise organizations.
While the dynamic churn and dissimilarity in content across
phishing emails proves challenging, our approach can detect
87.3% of attacks in our dataset, while generating less than 4
false positives per every 1,000,000 employee-sent emails.
Second, combining the attacks we detect with a corpus of
user-reported lateral phishing attacks, we conduct the ﬁrst
large-scale characterization of lateral phishing in real-world
organizations. Our analysis shows that this attack is potent
and widespread: dozens of organizations, ranging from ones
with fewer than 100 employees to ones with over 1,000 em-
ployees, experience lateral phishing attacks within the span

of several months; in total, 14% of a set of randomly sam-
pled organizations experienced at least one lateral phishing
incident within a seven-month timespan. Furthermore, we
estimate that over 11% of attackers successfully compromise
at least one additional employee. Even though our ground
truth sources and detector face limitations that restrict their
ability to uncover stealthy or narrowly targeted attacks, our re-
sults nonetheless illuminate a prominent threat that currently
affects many real-world organizations.
Examining the behavior of lateral phishers, we explore and
quantify the popularity of four recipient (victim) selection
strategies. Although our dataset’s attackers target dozens to
hundreds of recipients, these recipients often include a sub-
set of users with some relationship to the hijacked account
(e.g., fellow employees or recent contacts). Additionally, we
develop a categorization for the different levels of content
tailoring displayed by our dataset’s phishing messages. Our
categorization shows that while 7% of attacks deploy targeted
messages, most attacks opt for generic content that a phisher
could easily reuse across multiple organizations. In particular,
we observe that lateral phishers rely predominantly on two
common lures: a pretext of a shared document and a fake
warning message about a problem with the recipient’s ac-
count. Despite the popularity of non-targeted content, nearly
one-third of our dataset’s attackers invest additional time and
effort to make their attacks more convincing and/or to evade
detection; and, over 80% of attacks occur during the normal
working hours of the hijacked account.
Ultimately, this work yields two contributions that ex-
pand our understanding of enterprise phishing and potential
defenses against it. First, we present a novel detector that
achieves an order-of-magnitude better performance than prior
work, while operating on a minimal data requirement (only
leveraging historical emails). Second, through the ﬁrst large-
scale characterization of lateral phishing, we uncover the scale
and success of this emerging class of attacks and shed light on
common strategies that lateral phishers employ. Our analysis
illuminates a prevalent class of enterprise attackers whose
behavior does not fully match the tactics of targeted nation-
state attacks or industrial espionage. Nonetheless, these lateral
phishers still achieve success in the absence of new defenses,
and many of our dataset’s attackers do exhibit some signs of
sophistication and focused effort.
2 Background
In a lateral phishing attack, attackers use a compromised,
but legitimate, email account to send a phishing email to
their victim(s). The attacker’s goals and choice of malicious
payload can take a number of different forms, from a malware-
infected attachment, to a phishing URL, to a fake payment
request. Our work focuses on lateral phishing attacks that
employ a malicious URL embedded in the email, which is the
most common exploit method identiﬁed in our dataset.

Listing 1 shows an anonymized example of a lateral phish-
ing attack from our study. In this attack, the phisher tried to
lure the recipient into clicking on a link under the false pre-
tense of a new contract. Additionally, the attacker also tried to
make the deception more credible by responding to recipients
who inquired about the email’s authenticity; and they also
actively hid their presence in the compromised user’s mailbox
by deleting all traces of their phishing email.
Lateral phishing represents a dangerous but understudied
attack at the intersection of phishing and account hijacking.
Phishing attacks, broadly construed, involve an attacker craft-
ing a deceptive email from any account (compromised or
spoofed) to trick their victim into performing some action.
Account hijacking, also known as account takeover (ATO)
in industry parlance, involves the use of a compromised ac-
count for any kind of malicious means (e.g., including spam).
While prior work primarily examines each of these attacks at a
smaller scale and with respect to personal accounts, our work
studies the intersection of both of these at a large scale and
from the perspective of enterprise organizations. In doing so,
we expand our understanding of important enterprise threats,
avenues for defending against them, and strategies used by
the attackers who perpetrate them.
2.1 Related Work
Detection: An extensive body of prior literature proposes
numerous techniques for detecting traditional phishing at-
tacks [1,3,13,14,44], as well as more sophisticated spearphish-
ing attacks [8, 10, 23, 41, 47]. Hu et al. studied how to use
social graph metrics to detect malicious emails sent from
compromised accounts [19]. Their approach detects hijacked
accounts with false positive rates between 20–40%. Unfortu-
nately, in practice, many organizations handle tens of thou-
sands of employee-sent emails per day, so a false positive
rate of 20% would lead to thousands of false alerts each day.
IdentityMailer, proposed by Stringhini et al. [41], detects lat-
eral phishing attacks by training behavior models based on
timing patterns, metadata, and stylometry for each user. If a
new email deviates from an employee’s behavioral model,

their system ﬂags it as an attack. While promising, their ap-
proach produces false positive rates in the range of 1–10%,
which is untenable in practice given the high volume of benign
emails and low base rate of phishing. Additionally, their sys-
tem requires training a behavioral model for each employee,
incurring expensive technical debt to operate at scale.
Ho et al. developed methods for detecting lateral
spearphishing by applying a novel anomaly detection algo-
rithm on a set of features derived from historical user login
data and enterprise network trafﬁc logs [18]. Their approach
detects both known and newly discovered attacks, with a false
positive rate of 0.004%. However, organizations with less
technical expertise often lack the infrastructure to compre-
hensively capture the enterprise’s network trafﬁc, which this
prior approach requires. This technical prerequisite begs the
question, can we practically detect lateral phishing attacks
with a more minimalist dataset: only the enterprise’s historical
emails? Furthermore, their dataset reﬂects a single enterprise
that experienced only two lateral phishing attacks across a
3.5-year timespan, which prevents them from characterizing
the nature of lateral phishing at a general scale.
Characterization: While prior work shows that attackers
frequently use phishing to compromise accounts, and that
attackers occasionally conduct (lateral) phishing from these
hijacked accounts, few efforts have studied the nature of lat-
eral phishing in depth and at scale. Examining a sample of
phishing emails, webpages, and compromised accounts from
Google data sources, one prior study of account hijacking
discovered that attackers often use these accounts to send
phishing emails to the account’s contacts [6]. However, they
concluded that automatically detecting such attacks proves
challenging. Onaolapo et al. studied what attackers do with
hijacked accounts [32], but they did not examine lateral phish-
ing. Separate from email accounts, a study of compromised
Twitter accounts found that infections appear to spread later-
ally through the social network. However their dataset did not
allow direct observation of the lateral attack vector itself [42],
nor did it provide insights into the domain of compromised
enterprise accounts (given the nature of social media).
Open Questions and Challenges: Prior work makes clear
that account compromise poses a signiﬁcant and widespread
problem. This literature also presents promising defenses for
enterprises that have sophisticated monitoring in place. Yet
despite these advances, several key questions remain unre-
solved. Do organizations without comprehensive monitoring
and technical expertise have a practical way to defend against
lateral phishing attacks? What common strategies and trade-
craft do lateral phishers employ? How are lateral phishers
capitalizing on their control of legitimate accounts, and what
does their tactical sophistication say about the state of enter-
prise phishing? This paper takes a step towards answering
these open questions by presenting a new detection strategy
and a large-scale characterization of lateral phishing attacks.

2.2 Ethics
In this work, our team, consisting of researchers from
academia and a large security company, developed detection
techniques using a dataset of historical emails and reported
incidents from 92 organizations who are active customers of
Barracuda Networks. These organizations granted Barracuda
permission to access their Ofﬁce 365 employee mailboxes for
the purpose of researching and developing defenses against
lateral phishing. Per Barracuda’s policies, all fetched emails
are stored encrypted, and customers have the option of revok-
ing access to their data at any time.
Due to the sensitivity of the data, only authorized em-
ployees at Barracuda were allowed to access the data (un-
der standard, strict access control policies). No personally
identifying information or sensitive data was shared with any
non-employee of Barracuda. Our project also received legal
approval from Barracuda, who had permission from their
customers to analyze and operate on the data.
Once Barracuda deployed a set of lateral phishing detectors
to production, any detected attacks were reported to customers
in real time to prevent ﬁnancial loss and harm.
3 Data
Our dataset consists of employee-sent emails from 92 English-
language organizations; 23 organizations came from ran-
domly sampling enterprises that had reports of lateral phish-
ing, and 69 were randomly sampled from all organizations.
