# What / Why
`npm` keeps creating its cache directory in my `$HOME`. I keep very few
directories in my `$HOME` to keep things findable, and its very annoying when
apps start littering stuff there.
## When
Any time I run things like `npm install blah`.
## Where
    $ uname -srmo
    Linux 5.7.2-arch1-1 x86_64 GNU/Linux
## How
### Current Behavior
A directory is creted in `$HOME` and cache data stored in there.
### Steps to Reproduce
  0. Run `rm -rf .cache` to delete your existing cache.
  1. Navigate to a directory with an existing `package.json`.
  2. Run `npm install`.
### Expected Behavior
The cache directory should be in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` on Linux. Specifically, it
should be `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/npm`. `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` should default to `.cache`
if undefined.
I believe on macOS there's a different spec for default locations, and things
like cache are stored in a different place. I don't know the name of the spec
so can't easily link in here.
