Assistant: In cloud-native applications, container orchestration tools are mainly responsible for the unified orchestration and management of containers, including scheduling, deployment, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance. Commonly used container orchestration tools include: 1. Kubernetes: Open source and maintained by Google, the container orchestration tool has the characteristics of high availability, flexibility and scalability, and has become the most popular container orchestration tool in the industry. 2. Docker Swarm: A container orchestration tool officially developed by Docker, seamlessly integrated with Docker Engine, easy to use, and suitable for small-scale container deployment. 3. Mesos: A container orchestration tool developed by Apache, which manages containers and allocates resources through a centralized scheduling system, and is suitable for large-scale container clusters. 4. Rancher: An open source container management platform with built-in Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and other container orchestration tools, supports cross-cloud environment operation, and is easy to deploy and manage. 5. Nomad: A lightweight container orchestration tool developed by HashiCorp, which supports multiple container technologies and scheduling strategies, and is suitable for small and medium container clusters.
