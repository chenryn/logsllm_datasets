The `editor.insertSpaces` setting can autodetect if it should insert spaces or
tabs. Some people like tabs more then spaces, but it's just personal
preference.
I think in Code = 0.10 it changed to spaces. I'm more a tab guy, except for `json`
files. So that's why I don't want to set it to `false` because I would have to
change it forth and back when in a JSON file.
The setting should not be reverted, but maybe an extra setting like
`editor.insertSpacesDefault` which can only be set to `true` and `false` and
has a default of `true` (to not break the current behaviour). If
`editor.insertSpaces` is set to `auto` and a new file is created, it will
check the `editor.insertSpacesDefault` setting.
@alexandrudima I guess you are the person for this as you wrote the tests
regarding the `insertSpaces` autodetect :)
