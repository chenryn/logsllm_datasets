User: How to locate performance problems in the application? Please list several tools and techniques.
Assistant: 1. Use application performance monitor (APM) tools, such as New Relic, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, etc., to locate performance problems in the application. 2. Use code analysis tools, such as JProfiler, VisualVM, YourKit, etc., to track method execution time, memory usage, thread status, etc., so as to find potential performance problems. 3. Using log analysis tools, such as Rizhiyi, Splunk, etc., can help developers analyze log information to identify performance problems and solve them. 4. Use load testing tools, such as JMeter, Gatling, etc., to simulate high-concurrency users accessing applications, and find application bottlenecks and performance problems. 5. Use the debugging tools that come with the development tools, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc., to set breakpoints, single-step debugging, view variables, etc., to help developers find performance problems in code execution. 6. Use code review tools, such as Checkstyle, FindBugs, etc., to check whether the code written by the developer complies with the specification and avoid unnecessary performance problems. 7. Use the management interface that comes with the application server, such as Tomcat Management Console, WebLogic, Jboss, etc., to view information such as the running status and number of threads of the application, and obtain the performance of the application.
