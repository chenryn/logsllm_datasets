User: I want to do subprocess.call, and get the output of the call into a string. Can I do this directly, or do I need to pipe it to a file, and then read from it? 
In other words, can I somehow redirect stdout and stderr into a string?
Assistant: subprocess.call() takes the same arguments as subprocess.Popen(), which includes the stdout and stderr arguments. See the docs for details.
