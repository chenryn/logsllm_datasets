**User:**
I would like to use `subprocess.call` and capture its output into a string. Is it possible to do this directly, or do I need to redirect the output to a file and then read the file's contents? In other words, can I somehow redirect `stdout` and `stderr` into a string?

**Assistant:**
To capture the output of a subprocess call directly into a string, you should use `subprocess.run` (available in Python 3.5 and later) or `subprocess.Popen` instead of `subprocess.call`. Both `subprocess.run` and `subprocess.Popen` allow you to redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to a variable, which can then be converted to a string.

Here is an example using `subprocess.run`:

```python
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run(['your_command', 'arg1', 'arg2'], 
                        stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
                        stderr=subprocess.PIPE, 
                        text=True)

output = result.stdout
error = result.stderr

print("Output:", output)
print("Error:", error)
```

In this example, `stdout` and `stderr` are captured and stored in the `result` object. The `text=True` argument ensures that the output is returned as a string rather than bytes.

If you need to use `subprocess.Popen`, you can do so as follows:

```python
import subprocess

process = subprocess.Popen(['your_command', 'arg1', 'arg2'], 
                           stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
                           stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

output, error = process.communicate()

print("Output:", output.decode())
print("Error:", error.decode())
```

In this case, `communicate()` is used to read the output and error streams, and `decode()` is called to convert the byte strings to regular strings.

For more details, you can refer to the official Python documentation on `subprocess`.
