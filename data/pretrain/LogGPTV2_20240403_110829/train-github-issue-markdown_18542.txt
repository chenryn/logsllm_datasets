# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.19041.264
    PowerToys version: 0.18.2
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FanzyZones (Keyboard Manager?)
# Steps to reproduce
  1. In FancyZones enable "Override Windows Snap hotkeys (Win + arrow) to move windows between zones"
  2. In Keyboard Manager use "Remap a key" to swap Alt (Left) and Win (Left), by mapping: 
    * Win (Left) to Alt (Left)
    * Alt (Left) to Win (Left)
  3. Hold `Alt (Left)` (mapped to Win) press `Left` (arrow key).
# Expected behavior
Window moves between zones.
# Actual behavior
Window uses normal Windows Snap behavior.
# Additional test scenario
This re-binding of Win (Left) to another key seems to cascade to mapped
shortcuts as well.
## Steps to reproduce
  1. Follow steps to reproduce described above
  2. In Keyboard Manager use "Remap shortcuts" to give a VIM style movement binding: 
    * Win (Left), Shift (Left), H to Win (Left), Left
  3. Hold `Alt (Left)` (mapped to Win Left) and `Shift (Left)` then press `H` key
## Expected behavior
Window moves between zones.
## Actual behavior
Window uses normal Windows Snap behavior.
# Work around
Now that I understand the issue, I'm working around this by leaving Win/Alt
unmodified and instead creating shortcut mappings for any hotkeys I'd like to
use with the key next to spacebar. This seems to work well enough and means I
can do things such as map Alt-L which was not possible with Win-L.
If the issue reported isn't reasonably achievable, my request would be to put
a note in Keyboard Manager that rebinding Win (Left) may cause unpredictable
behavior.
