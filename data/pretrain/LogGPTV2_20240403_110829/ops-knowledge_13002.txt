User: Please describe a process monitoring program in a Linux environment, and list its common usage scenarios.
Assistant: The process monitoring program in the Linux environment refers to a program that can monitor the status of all running processes in the system in real time. It can provide various monitoring indicators, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk read and write speed, etc. Common process monitoring programs include top, htop, and glances. The top program is a process monitoring program based on the command line. It can display the CPU, memory, virtual memory, IO, etc. of each process in real time, and can sort according to different indicators. top is often used to check whether some processes occupy too many resources when the system is busy. htop is a more powerful process monitoring program than top, it supports mouse operation and color-based interface, and can provide more detailed and accurate system monitoring information. htop is suitable for scenarios that require more detailed monitoring of system load, such as system tuning and troubleshooting. glances is a system monitoring program written in Python. It can remotely monitor various indicators of the system through the web interface, and provides an interactive user interface, which can efficiently view various system monitoring conditions. glances is suitable for scenarios that require real-time monitoring of a large number of server systems, such as cloud computing platforms and network device management. Generally speaking, the process monitoring program is suitable for various scenarios that require real-time monitoring of system operation status, especially in server management and system maintenance.
