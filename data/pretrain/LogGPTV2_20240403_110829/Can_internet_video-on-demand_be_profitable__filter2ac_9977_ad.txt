### 4. REAL-WORLD CASE STUDY

In the previous section, we presented a theoretical model that highlighted several fundamental issues in peer-assisted Video on Demand (VoD). In this section, we will use the MSN Video trace data, as described in Section 2, to gain practical insights. Although the traces were generated from a client-server deployment, we will use them to simulate peer-assisted VoD.

#### 4.1 Trace Analysis for the Two Most Popular Videos

We are particularly interested in how early departures and user interactivity (such as skipping video segments) affect the performance of peer-assisted VoD and prefetching policies. We consider three cases in our trace analysis:
1. All users watch the entire video without departing early and without any interactivity.
2. Early departures are preserved, but interactivity is ignored.
3. The original trace is used, including both early departures and user interactivity.

**Case (i): All Users Watch the Entire Video**

First, we analyze the scenario where all users watch the entire video. To achieve this, we modify the trace data so that each arriving user stays in the system for the full length of the video, and we disregard all skipping request records that do not start from the beginning of the video. We focus on the two most popular videos in April 2006. Figure 9 shows the server resources required on a day-by-day basis for the month of April. The no-P2P curve represents the server rate in a pure client-server deployment, which also reflects the user demand for the video over time.

The request patterns for these two videos are strikingly different. The most popular video, referred to as the "gold stream," was released on April 5 and quickly attracted a large number of requests. However, the demand for this video declined rapidly, with only occasional views five days after its release. The second most popular video, the "silver stream," maintained consistent popularity throughout the month. We observe that the demand for this video followed a daily peak and valley cycle, with a notable 7-day cycle where the valleys align with weekend times.

We use these traces to drive the simulation and study the performance of the proposed policies. Our model in Section 3 indicated that the greedy policy performs better than the water-leveling policy and is generally close to the lower bound. Therefore, we focus on the greedy policy for the peer-assisted deployments. In Figure 9, we plot the server rate with peer assistance for two cases: at the current quality level and at 3× the current quality level. The 3× video rate pushes the system from the surplus mode into the deficit mode.

**Observations:**
- If a peer-assisted distribution system had been used instead of the client-server system, the server rate would have been dramatically reduced. Figure 9 shows a potential 1000-fold reduction in server rate.
- For the P2P deployment at the current quality level, typically no server resources are needed. Occasional traffic at the server occurs when the demand for the video enters valleys, corresponding to small numbers of concurrent users in the system. This conforms with our analysis, as peer-assisted VoD is more likely to run into temporary deficit states requiring server participation when the number of concurrent users is small.
- For these two videos, MSN Video is clearly operating in the surplus mode due to the relatively low bitrates of the videos. When a peer-assisted VoD solution is deployed, we can easily offer much higher streaming quality (e.g., tripling the bitrate) and still significantly reduce the server rate.
- Peer-assistance can be beneficial for both flash crowd (gold stream) and long-lasting (silver stream) videos.

**Table 3: 95th Percentile Rule for Client-Server and Peer-Assistance (No Prefetching)**

| Video | Client-Server (Mbps) | Current Quality (Mbps) | 3x Quality (Mbps) |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Gold  | 12.5                 | 0.23                   | 0.18               |
| Silver| 14.5                 | 0.26                   | 0.17               |

**Table 3** presents the performance of peer-assisted VoD in the context of the 95th percentile rule. Results are given for the current quality scaling (surplus mode) and the 3× bit-rate scaling (deficit mode). We observe dramatic improvements going from client-server to peer-assistance with no-prefetching, and further improvements with the greedy prefetching policy in the deficit mode. The performance of the greedy policy is very close to the lower bound. Note that the server bandwidths for the gold stream are actually less than those for the silver stream because there was little demand five days after the release of the gold stream.

#### 4.2 Impact of Early Departures

In this subsection, we use the April traces but now preserve early departures when they occur. Hence, the duration of each session varies, unlike the previous case where all sessions had the same video length. To avoid introducing too many factors at once, we still disregard user interactivity in this subsection.

We focus on the balanced mode in this subsection. By scaling the video bitrate, we can easily drive the system from the surplus mode, through the balanced mode, to the deficit mode. Using the silver stream as an example, Table 4 shows server rates, averaged over the entire month of April, for both the no-prefetching and the greedy prefetching policies.

**Table 4: Server Rates (in Mbps) Under Different System Modes with Early Departures**

| Bitrate Scaling | Client-Server | No-Prefetching | Greedy | Lower Bound |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| 1.0             | 36.0          | 0.26           | 0      | 0           |
| 1.4             | 50.4          | 0.40           | 0.01   | 0           |
| 1.8             | 64.8          | 0.60           | 0.18   | 0           |
| 2.2             | 79.2          | 1.01           | 0.54   | 0.22        |
| 2.6             | 93.7          | 2.55           | 2.09   | 1.81        |
| 3.0             | 108.1         | 7.60           | 7.19   | 7.13        |

From Table 4, we observe that even with early departures, peer-assistance can provide a dramatic improvement in performance. Prefetching continues to provide improvements over non-prefetching, particularly in the balanced mode (scaling 1.8 to 2.6).

#### 4.3 Impact of User Interactivity

As described in Section 2, user interactivity is not uncommon in Internet VoD, especially for long videos. For instance, for videos over 30 minutes in length, approximately 40% of sessions contained some interactivity. In this subsection, we assess the impact of interactivity on peer-assisted VoD.

When there is user interactivity, a user might have holes in its buffer, making it unable to share all content up to its current playback point. It is possible to keep track of all buffer segments at all users and simulate the system based on the exact buffer status, but such a simulation would be computationally demanding and potentially prohibitive given the size of our dataset. Instead, we examine two extreme approaches, which should serve as good bounds for the actual performance:
- **Conservative Approach:** Sets the user upload bandwidth to zero after interactivity. Thus, a modified user no longer serves content after interactivity, and the holes in its buffer do not matter.
- **Optimistic Approach:** Assumes there is no hole in the user’s buffer even after interactivity, allowing the user to upload any requested content.

Using the traffic on April 18 as an example, we plot the total available user upload bandwidth corresponding to both approaches in Figure 10. The gap between the total available bandwidths of the two approaches is not significant, indicating that the loss of upload bandwidth due to interactivity is not substantial. Therefore, the results from the previous subsection (accounting for early departures) are also representative for interactivity.

- (b) Available upload (conservative)
- (c) Available upload (optimistic)

#### 4.4 All Things Considered

Having explored the impact of early departures and user interactivity, we now investigate the total server bandwidth cost for the month of April 2006. During this month, MSN made available more than 12,000 videos. The multiplexing effect across the 12,000+ videos is of interest, as one video's peak might coincide with another video's valley. Here, we use the 95th percentile criterion to measure the server bandwidth cost. We examine three deployment scenarios: client-server; using P2P without increasing quality; and using P2P with 3 times the quality. For each P2P deployment, we use the greedy prefetching policy.

**Figure 11: CDF of 5-Minute Average Bandwidths for the Month of April Using All Videos**

- (a) No P2P
- (b) P2P conservative (3x quality)
- (c) P2P optimistic (3x quality)
- (d) P2P conservative (current quality)
- (e) 95th percentile cut

Figure 11 shows the cumulative distribution of the five-minute average bandwidths for the month of April using all 12,000+ videos. The results from both the conservative and optimistic approaches are presented. We omit the curve for the optimistic peer-assisted approach at the current quality level, as it aligns very closely with the curve of the conservative approach. The savings using the 95th percentile rule are summarized in Table 5.

**Table 5: Savings Using the 95th Percentile Rule**

| Approach       | Server Rate (Gbps) | Saving (%) |
|----------------|--------------------|------------|
| Conservative   | 1.23               | 97.0       |
| Optimistic     | 1.23               | 97.3       |

In summary, peer-assisted VoD, even with early departures and user interactivity, can significantly reduce server bandwidth costs while maintaining or improving video quality.
