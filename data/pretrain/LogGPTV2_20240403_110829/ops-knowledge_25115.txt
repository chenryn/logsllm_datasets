User: I am using Python to create windows commands using subprocess.call(command) where command is a string I've generated for the Windows command.  I need the results of my command to output to a .txt file so I use 2>> C:\Users\me\out.txt as part of command except Python does not seem to recognize the greater than character, >.  I've tried using the Unicode value, u'\u003E' too.
[EDIT] If I copy command and paste it into my command prompt, then it will execute the command properly.  Otherwise it won't work from my Python script.
Assistant: If you are using shell constructs such as redirection, you need the parameter shell=True.
