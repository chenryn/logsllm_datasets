When running a command with `pip`, I encountered the following error. Even executing `pip -V` produces the same error.

**Error:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):

AttributeError: '_NamespacePath' object has no attribute 'sort'
```

I found that this error is often attributed to `setuptools` version 31.0.0, and it is recommended to use a version lower than 28.0.0. However, my current `setuptools` version is 26.1.1, and the error persists.

**Solution:**
The only solution I could find is to reinstall `pip`. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo -H python get-pip.py --prefix=/usr/local/
```

Please note that this solution works for `pip` but not for `pip3`.
