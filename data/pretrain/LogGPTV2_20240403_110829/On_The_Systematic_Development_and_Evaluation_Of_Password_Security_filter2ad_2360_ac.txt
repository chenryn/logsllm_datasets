### Figure 3: Overview of the Results from the Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment Questionnaires

**(a) Ratios of Correct Responses to Scenarios:**
This section presents the ratios of correct responses to the scenarios in both the pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires.

**(b) Perceived Security on a 5-Point Likert Scale:**
This chart displays the participants' responses on a 5-point Likert scale with respect to perceived security. The responses are standardized in terms of correctness: higher values indicate more accurate assessments (i.e., recognizing easy-to-guess passwords as insecure and diceware passwords as secure).

### Analysis of H1a
A Wilcoxon signed rank test was conducted to compare the pre-treatment (Pre-1) and post-treatment (Post-1a) results, as shown in Figure 2. The test revealed a significant increase in the number of correct responses (V = 25.5, p = .017). The effect size, r = 0.378, indicates a medium effect. This suggests that working through the awareness-raising material significantly improves employees' ability to assess the security of known scenarios.

### Analysis of H1b
We also investigated whether participants could transfer the knowledge gained from the awareness-raising material to new scenarios presented only in the post-treatment questionnaire (Post-1b). A Wilcoxon rank sum test did not find a significant difference (W = 134, p = .070) between the pre-treatment and post-treatment responses for these new scenarios. Although the test narrowly missed significance, this result indicates that the awareness-raising material may not improve the employees' ability to assess the security of unfamiliar scenarios. Therefore, the results do not support H1b.

### 5.2 Password Security Ratings

**Figure 3b: Participants' Password Security Ratings**
This figure shows the participants' ratings of passwords in the pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires. Only 81 out of 84 participants were included in the analysis for H2a, as three participants did not complete all password ratings.

### Analysis of H2a
After the treatment, the assessment of all passwords improved, with more participants correctly identifying insecure passwords as insecure and secure passwords as secure. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a significant difference in the accumulated Likert scores (V = 291, p < .001). The effect size, r = 0.423, indicates a medium effect. Thus, the results support H2a.

In the pre-treatment questionnaire, most participants correctly identified the insecurity of the insecure passwords but incorrectly assessed the security of the secure passwords. A Wilcoxon signed rank test confirmed a significant difference in the correctness of the assessment between secure and insecure passwords (V = 3321, p < .001), with an effect size r = 0.614, indicating a large effect. This difference persisted in the post-treatment questionnaire, where another Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a significant difference (V = 3240, p < .001) with an effect size r = 0.612, again indicating a large effect.

### 5.3 Qualitative Results

While most participants provided concise answers to the qualitative questions, clear themes emerged across four aspects:

#### 5.3.1 Relevancy of Included Information
Most participants (90.6%) found the content of the awareness-raising material relevant and helpful. They expressed positive opinions, such as: “It was very helpful. I have learned a lot!” (P7) and “I believe the [content of the material] is relevant for everybody in today’s world. I have never seen such good education materials, all information was very helpful.” (P62).

Three topics were particularly helpful:
1. Information on password composition and guessing attacks.
2. Guidance on regular password changes.
3. Information about password managers.

The most frequent concern (voiced by six participants) was that the material was too long.

#### 5.3.2 Additional Information Desired by Participants
The most frequently mentioned aspect participants would have liked more information on (20.8% of those who answered) was concrete details about password managers and software for generating secure passwords, e.g., “Concrete suggestions regarding software which can be used to generate secure passwords, about good password managers.” (P78). Additionally, 16.7% of participants wanted more specific rules for choosing passwords.

#### 5.3.3 Helpfulness of Images
All participants found the images in the awareness-raising material helpful, with comments such as: “The images were very helpful in understanding the [awareness-raising material’s content].” (P53) and “The images were very helpful.” (P89).

#### 5.3.4 Effect of the Awareness-Raising Material on Password Management
The dominant theme in responses was the use of password managers. 20.3% of participants stated their intention to start using a password manager, while 61.0% said they would continue using one. An additional 9.8% planned to change their password creation strategy, and 8.9% indicated that the material would not impact their behavior.

### 6. Results – Retention Questionnaires

This section presents the analysis of hypotheses H1c, H1d, and H2b based on data from the retention questionnaires. Only one of the three SMEs (SME-r) participated in the retention after six months. Participants excluded from the pre-treatment and post-treatment analyses were also excluded from the retention analysis. The sample for the retention questionnaire included 26 participants, with 16 males, 9 females, and one participant who did not specify gender. The age range was 19 to 43 years (M: 32.2 years; SD: 5.5 years).

#### 6.1 Assessment of Scenarios

**6.1.1 Differences Between SME-r and Other SMEs**
Employees of SME-r did not perform significantly differently in the pre-treatment questionnaire compared to the other two SMEs (W = 151, p = 0.182). This held true for the post-treatment questionnaire as well (W = 207, p = .856).

**6.1.2 Analysis of H1c**
Participants in the retention performed better in the retention questionnaire than in the pre-treatment questionnaire for scenarios seen in the pre-treatment. A Wilcoxon signed rank test indicated a significant difference (V = 15.5, p = .022) with an effect size r = 0.363, indicating a medium effect. Thus, the results support H1c.

**6.1.3 Analysis of H1d**
For scenarios not seen in the pre-treatment, the retention also showed improvement. A Wilcoxon rank sum test indicated a significant difference (W = 125, p = .031) with an effect size r = 0.482, indicating a medium effect. Thus, the results support H1d.

#### 6.2 Password Security Ratings

**6.2.1 Differences Between SME-r and Other SMEs**
Employees of SME-r performed worse in the pre-treatment questionnaire than those from the other two SMEs (W = 405, p = .004), with an effect size r = 0.484, indicating a medium effect. However, in the post-treatment questionnaire, SME-r employees rated password security more accurately (W = 977.5, p = .002), with an effect size r = 0.484, also indicating a medium effect.

**6.2.2 Analysis of H2b**
A Wilcoxon rank sum test showed that performance in the pre-treatment questionnaire was significantly worse than in the retention questionnaire (V = 0, p < .001) with an effect size r = 0.603, indicating a large effect. Thus, the results support H2b. A Wilcoxon signed rank test also showed a significant difference in the correctness of the assessment between secure and insecure passwords in the retention questionnaire (V = 129, p = .002) with an effect size r = 0.462, indicating a medium effect.

### 7. Discussion

The awareness-raising material was well-received by all participating employees and addressed all relevant attacks as per literature and expert opinions. Table 1 summarizes the results for all hypotheses. The material significantly improved participants' ability to assess the security of passwords and known scenarios. However, it did not significantly improve their ability to assess unknown scenarios, though the results were close to significance.

The retention results suggest that participants may have discussed the scenarios with colleagues, revisited the material, or experienced a learning effect. We discuss potential improvements and limitations below.

#### 7.1 Improvements Derived from the User Study

1. **Scenario 9 Improvement**: Poor performance on scenario 9 was addressed by adapting the material based on free text answers. These corrections were made available to participants after the retention.
2. **Password Creation Strategies**: Participants struggled to rate the security of long, concatenated word passwords. Additional explanations and examples were added to the material to improve this.
3. **Additional Advice**: Participants desired more concrete advice on creating secure passwords and using password managers. A dedicated section on password creation strategies was considered.
4. **Alternative Technologies**: Future versions of the material may include additional alternatives to text passwords, such as Face ID or palm vein authentication.

#### 7.2 Limitations

1. **Participant Sample**: Six participants had to be excluded due to their advanced knowledge of information security. All participants were from German SMEs, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
2. **Study Design**: The study was conducted in real work environments, but participants were unsupervised, leading to potential issues such as using the material during the questionnaire, partial reading, and collaboration.
3. **Retention Participation**: Only one SME agreed to participate in the retention, raising concerns about productivity.
4. **Baseline Performance**: Over 88% of responses were correct even before the material, suggesting either methodological issues or prior education.
5. **Control Condition**: A control condition was not included due to limited participant recruitment, which would have strengthened the evidence of the material's effectiveness.

### 8. Conclusion

This work presents a systematically developed awareness-raising material aimed at improving lay-users' understanding of password security. The material, created through an iterative process, addresses all relevant attacks and defenses. It significantly enhances participants' ability to assess the security of known scenarios and passwords. While further improvements are needed, the material has the potential to be adapted for other information security contexts.
