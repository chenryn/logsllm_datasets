is the participants’ assessment.
treatment (Pre-1 and Post-1a in Figure 2). A Wilcoxon signed rank
test shows this increase to be signicant (V = 25.5, p = .017).
The eect size r = 0.378 is above .3, i.e. indicates a medium eect.
This indicates that working through the awareness-raising material
leads to a signicant improvement in the employees’ ability to
assess behaviour as secure or insecure in scenarios known before
the treatment. Thus, the results of our study support H1a.
5.1.2 Analysis of H1b . Additionally, we investigate whether the
participants can transfer the knowledge gained by reading the
awareness-raising material to scenarios they only saw in the post-
treatment questionnaire. A Wilcoxon rank sum test does not nd
a signicant dierence (W = 134, p = .070) between the portions
of correct responses in the pre-treatment questionnaire and the
responses in the post-treatment questionnaire corresponding to the
scenarios only present in the post-treatment questionnaire (Pre-1
and Post-1b in Figure 2). While the test only closely fails signicance,
this result indicates that working through the awareness-raising
material might not improve the employees’ ability to assess infor-
mation security behaviour as secure or insecure in new scenarios
unknown before reading the awareness-raising material. Thus, the
results of our study do not support H1b.
5.2 Password Security Ratings
Figure 3b shows the participants’ ratings of the passwords in the
pre-treatment and the post-treatment questionnaires. We could
only include 81 participants in the analysis regarding H2a, since
three participants did not complete the ratings of all passwords.
5.2.1 Analysis of H2a. After the treatment, the assessment of
all passwords improved, i.e. the insecure passwords were perceived
as insecure by more participants and the secure passwords were
perceived as secure by more participants. A Wilcoxon signed rank
test showed a signicant dierence between the accumulated Likert
scores of the 81 participants (V = 291, p < .001). The eect size
r = 0.423 is above .3, i.e. a medium eect. Thus, the results of our
study provide supporting evidence with respect to H2a.
In the pre-treatment questionnaire, the security of most of the
insecure passwords was assessed correctly by the participants. In
contrast, the security of the secure passwords was mostly assessed
incorrectly. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a signicant dif-
ference in the correctness of the assessment between the secure
and insecure passwords (V = 3321, p < .001). The eect size
r = 0.614 indicates a large eect. This dierence remains in the
post-treatment questionnaire: a Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a
signicant dierence (V = 3240, p < .001). The eect size r = 0.612
again indicates a large eect.
5.3 Qualitative Results
While most participants answered the qualitative questions, the par-
ticipants’ responses to these questions were very concise. However,
for all four aspects under investigation clear themes emerged.
5.3.1 Relevancy of Included Information. Most participants who
answered the respective free text questions found the content of
the awareness-raising material relevant and helpful (90.6%). Par-
ticipants were unexpectedly explicit with respect to their positive
opinion about the material, e.g.: “It was very helpful. I have learned
a lot!” (P7) and “I believe the [content of the material] is relevant for
everybody in today’s world. I have never seen such good education
materials, all information was very helpful.” (P62).
Three topics were perceived as particularly helpful by the par-
ticipants: (1) the information regarding password composition and
guessing attacks, (2) the information with respect to regular changes
of passwords, and (3) the information on password managers. The
most frequently voiced concern (stated by 6 participants) was that
the awareness-raising material was perceived as too long.

questionnaires. (b) The responses on the 5-point Likert scale with respect to the perceived security. In this chart, the partici-
pants’ responses are equalised in terms of correctness: the higher the value, the more correct (i.e. insecure for the easy to guess
passwords and secure for the diceware passwords) is the participants’ assessment.
5.3.2 Additional Information the Participants Would Have Hoped
For. The most frequently mentioned aspect participants would have
hoped for (20.8% of participants who answered this free text ques-
tion) was more concrete information with respect to password
managers and software which can be used to generate passwords,
e.g.: “Concrete suggestions regarding software which can be used to
generate secure passwords, about good password managers.” (P78).
The participants also would have liked more concrete rules on how
to choose passwords in addition to the composition advice already
present in the awareness-raising material (16.7%).
5.3.3 Helpfulness of the Images. All of the participants found
the images in the awareness-raising material helpful, e.g.: “The
images were very helpful in understanding the [awareness-raising
material’s content].” (P53) and “The images were very helpful.” (P89).
5.3.4 Eect of the Awareness-Raising Material on the Users’ Pass-
word Management. The dominant theme in the answers to this
free text question were password managers. 20.3% of participants
answering this question stated their intention to start using a pass-
word manager in the future instead of their original strategy. In
addition, 61.0% stated to continue using a password manager. An ad-
ditional 9.8% stated to create their passwords dierently from now
on (without explicitly specifying in which way). The remaining 8.9%
of participants answering this question stated that the awareness-
raising material would have no impact on their behaviour and did
not mention the use of password managers.
6 RESULTS – RETENTION QUESTIONNAIRES
In this section we present the analysis regarding the hypotheses
H1c,d and H2b based on the data from the retention questionnaires.
Since only one of the three SMEs agreed to participate in the re-
tention after six months, we highlight any dierences between
the SME partaking in the retention (SME-r in the following) and
the other two SMEs in order to allow correct interpretation of the
following analyses. Participants who had been excluded from the
analysis of the pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires
were also excluded from the analysis of the retention. Overall, the
sample for the retention questionnaire comprised 26 participants.
Of those 26 participants, 16 were male, 9 were female, and one
participant chose to not answer this question. The participants’ age
ranged from 19 years to 43 years (M: 32.2 years; SD: 5.5 years).
6.1 Assessment of Scenarios
For the analysis of the retention we again excluded scenarios 3 and
13, due to their issues outlined in section section 5.1.
6.1.1 Dierences of SME-r and the other two SMEs. The em-
ployees of SME-r did not perform signicantly dierent in the
pre-treatment questionnaire than the employees of the other two
SMEs. A Wilcoxon rank sum test does not indicate a signicant
dierence (W = 151, p = 0.182). This holds for the post-treatment
questionnaire as well, where a Wilcoxon rank sum test also does
not indicate a signicant dierence (W = 207, p = .856).
6.1.2 Analysis of H1c . The participants of our retention perform
better in the retention questionnaire than in the pre-treatment ques-
tionnaire with respect to the scenarios seen in the pre-treatment
questionnaire. A Wilcoxon signed rank test indicates a signicant
dierence (V = 15.5, p = .022) and r = 0.363 indicates a medium
eect for this dierence. Thus, the results of our study support H1c.
An overview of the results is depicted in gure 4a.
6.1.3 Analysis of H1d . For the scenarios not seen in the pre-
treatment questionnaire, assessments in the retention improved
as well when compared to the pre-treatment questionnaire. A
Wilcoxon rank sum test indicates a signicant dierence (W = 125,

6.2 Password Security Ratings
Note that we could only include 23 participants in the analysis
regarding H2b, since three of the 26 participants did not complete
the ratings for all passwords.
6.2.1 Dierences of SME-r and the other two SMEs. The employ-
ees of SME-r performed worse in the pre-treatment questionnaire
than the employees of the other two SMEs. A Wilcoxon rank sum
test showed a signicant dierence (W = 405, p = .004). An eect
size of r = 0.484 indicates a medium eect. This dierence be-
tween SME-r and the other two SMEs reverses in the post-treatment
questionnaire: the employees of SME-r rate the security of pass-
words more correctly than the employees of the other two SMEs.
A Wilcoxon rank sum test indicates this dierence to be signi-
cant (W = 977.5, p = .002). An eect size of r = 0.484 indicates a
medium eect.
6.2.2 Analysis of H2b . A Wilcoxon rank sum test indicates that
the performance in the pre-treatment questionnaire is signicantly
worse than in the retention questionnaire (V = 0, p < .001). An
eect size of r = 0.603 indicates a large eect. Thus, the results of
our study support H2b. An overview of the results is depicted in
gure 4b. Also, a Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a signicant
dierence in the correctness of the assessment between the secure
and insecure passwords for the retention questionnaire (V = 129,
p = .002). An eect size of r = 0.462 indicates a medium eect.
7 DISCUSSION
The awareness-raising material was received positively by all par-
ticipating employees and addresses all attacks deemed relevant by
the literature and independent information security experts from
academia and industry. Table 1 summarises the results with re-
spect to all hypotheses in our analysis. It signicantly increased
the participants’ ability to correctly assess the security of pass-
words. Moreover, it signicantly increased the participants’ ability
to correctly assess whether password-related behaviour in dierent
information security scenarios known before reading through the
material is secure or insecure. The results regarding whether the
material improves the ability to correctly assess password-related
behaviour in previously unknown scenarios closely fail signicance.
741
This again shows how dicult it is to develop eective awareness-
raising materials, even when following a thorough methodology
during their creation. Interestingly, the results of the retention show
that participants improved their ability to assess these scenarios.
This might indicate that our participants talked about the dier-
ent scenarios with colleagues also participating our study, that
they revisited the awareness-raising material, or that there was a
learning eect among the previously unknown scenarios where
the later seen scenarios in the post-treatment questionnaire helped
the participants to correctly assess other scenarios in the retention.
In the following, we will discuss rst the improvements to the
awareness-raising material we could derive from the results of our
user study. Then, we discuss the limitations of this work.
7.1 Improvements Derived from the User Study
Despite the overall successful outcome of this work, we identify
four areas for further improvements.
Firstly, the poor performance of the participants with respect to
one of the scenarios (scenario 9) mandated a further improvement
to the awareness-raising material. Fortunately, the free text answers
oered an explanation for the poor performance and the respective
formulation in the material could be adapted. Due to the fact that
we wanted to leave it up to the participants whether or not to revisit
the material before the retention questionnaire, this correction is
not yet visible in the retention results. However, the corrections
were later made available to the participating employees.
Secondly, participants seemed to be hesitant to rate the security
of long passwords composed of multiple concatenated words cor-
rectly. In contrast, our participants could signicantly better iden-
tify insecure passwords. This seems to indicate that our awareness-
raising material was more eective in improving the ability of the
participants to recognise insecure passwords than the ability to
recognise secure ones. Therefore, one focus of further improve-
ments must be the teaching of good creation strategies. As a rst
step, we added additional explanations and examples to the respec-
tive sections of the material. Again, the additional explanations and
examples were only available to the participants after the retention.
Thirdly, the qualitative answers show that the participating em-
ployees desire additional concrete advice with respect to two as-
pects: (1) how to create secure passwords and (2) password man-
agers. The former should be addressed to some degree by the in-
formation added to the awareness-raising material as outlined in
the last paragraph. Yet, a section dedicated to password creation
strategies should be considered in future iterations of the material.
Need for the latter is also supported by the large number of partici-
pants who stated that they would start using a password manager
after having worked through the material. This is a positive eect,
as usage of password managers is widely considered a good advice
to users by information security experts [17, 28].
Lastly, the awareness-raising material currently includes only
the technologies: password managers, two-factor authentication,
ngerprint readers, graphical passwords, hardware tokens, privacy
lters, and single-sign-on. Future versions of the awareness-raising
material might need to include additional alternatives to text pass-
words should they gain widespread adoption (e.g. Face ID [1] or
palm vein authentication [3]).

Despite the need for further improvements as outlined above, we
argue that this work can help create awareness-raising materials be-
yond the original application in the password context. The iterative
process used to create the password security awareness-raising ma-
terial could be easily applied to other information security contexts,
further contributing to the information security in organisations.
Therefore, applying the process in areas other than password secu-
rity represents one important line of future work.
7.2 Limitations
One limitation of our user study lies in the participant sample.
While the contact persons assured us that all participants would be
lay-users with respect to information security, we had to exclude
six participating employees, since their responses to the free text
answers indicated a thorough knowledge of information security.
Also, all participants are employed in German SMEs. Consequently,
it is unclear whether our ndings fully translate to dierent groups
of users and to dierent countries. As future work, we plan to
validate our results in various contexts.
Following the recommendations of Haeussinger and Kranz [14],
we conducted the study in the real work environments of the par-
ticipating employees. The most reliable option in this regard would
have been to monitor the password-related behaviour of the employ-
ees in their organisation and check whether the awareness-raising
material inuences this behaviour. However, such a design has se-
vere issues in a real world setting in organisations: Gathering the
necessary data might pose security risks (e.g. passwords created by
the employees to see whether creation strategies change) or have
legal and privacy implications (e.g. surveilling employees at their
desks in order to see whether they store notes of passwords inse-
curely). Consequently, we chose a dierent study design, allowing
us to retain the anonymity and privacy of our participants as well
as avoid any security risks, while delivering the study materials
to the participants’ real work environments. However, this design
came with the trade-o that contact to the participants was only
possible through the contact persons. Thus, the study setting could
not be controlled. The participants were unsupervised throughout
all four phases of the study. Therefore, a number of limitations
arise: (a) participants might have used the material while lling out
the questionnaire, (b) participants might have lled out the post-
treatment questionnaire after reading the material only partially,
(c) participants who work in the same SME might have worked
(partially) together, and (d) participants might have spent very dif-
ferent amounts of time reading through the material which might
have impaired consistency not only between organisations, but
also between the participants of each organisation. To counteract
these issues, participants received instructions during each of the
four phases in our study. Participants were instructed to read the
awareness-raising material carefully and in its entirety. Also, they
were told that the post-treatment questionnaire would be sent out
only after they had explicitly acknowledged having read the entire
material. Last but not least, participants were instructed to ll out
the questionnaire by themselves.
Furthermore, only one of the three SMEs agreed to participate in
the retention after six months. Concerns in the SMEs focused mostly
on the potential impact on productivity, due to the participants
lling out the questionnaires in their working environment. This
was a huge factor deterring SMEs from participating in the study.
While addressing this issue is dicult, since thorough investigations
rely on thorough questionnaires, we advise any researcher planning
similar endeavours to consider this issue.
Another limitation relates to the baseline in our participant sam-
ple. Even before working through the material, over 88% of the
responses were correct. This might indicate (a) a methodological
problem resulting from misaligned diculty levels of the scenarios
or (b) that the participants in our sample had already received edu-
cation with respect to password security before our study. Studies
with more dicult scenarios and dierent samples are needed to
investigate which of the two represents the cause for this issue.
Finally, we could not include a control condition in our study
design due to the limited amount of participants we could recruit in
the SMEs although this would have allowed us to present stronger
evidence with respect to the eectiveness of our awareness-raising
material.
8 CONCLUSION
In this work, we present a novel and systematically developed
awareness-raising material to make lay-users aware of attacks on
passwords and user accounts as well as the respective defences. We
developed this awareness-raising material in an iterative process. It
addresses all attacks deemed relevant by the literature and indepen-
dent information security experts from academia and industry. It
increases the participants’ ability to correctly assess (a) whether spe-
