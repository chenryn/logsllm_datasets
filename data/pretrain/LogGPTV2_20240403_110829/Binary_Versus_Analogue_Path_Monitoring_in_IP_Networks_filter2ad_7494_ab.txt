# Comparison of Continuous and Boolean Models for Path Monitoring in IP Networks

## Introduction
This paper compares the performance of two end-to-end path monitoring approaches: the continuous model and the Boolean model. The study focuses on the number of direct measurements required to determine the quality of all paths in various network topologies.

## Results and Observations

### Telstra Topology
- **Topology Details**: 115 nodes, 153 links.
- **Observation**: When the percentage of beacons exceeds 50%, both models require the same number of direct measurements (Fig. 2).

### Tiscali Topology
- **Topology Details**: 164 nodes, 328 links.
- **Observation**: Similar to the Telstra topology, the exact percentages at which the curves for the binary and continuous models cross differ (Fig. 3).

### General Observations
- **Tendencies**: All topologies exhibit similar tendencies for the number of direct measurements in both models.
- **Sensitivity**: Exact results are sensitive to the network topology.
- **Beacon Impact**: The percentage of required direct measurements drops rapidly with a small number of beacons but decreases slowly with a large number of beacons.

### Explanation
- **Vector Space Basis**:
  - **Boolean Model**: Paths are redundant if all their links are present in other paths.
  - **Continuous Model**: The rank of a matrix is upper-bounded by the minimum of the number of rows and columns. As the number of paths increases, the dimension of the basis increases rapidly initially but slows down as it approaches the number of columns.
- **Basis Composition**: For many paths, both models have a basis that contains mostly unit vectors.

## Internet Evaluation

### NLANR’s AMP Data
- **Data Collection**: January 23, 2004.
- **Network Details**: 133 monitors, 17556 end-to-end paths, 9405 nodes, 36674 directed edges.
- **Beacon Range**: 1 to 133 beacons (0.01% to 1.4% of nodes).
- **Observation**: In the regime where the percentage of beacons is very small (below 1%), the Boolean model requires fewer direct measurements, but the difference is minimal. Both models show a rapid decrease in the percentage of direct measurements as the number of beacons increases (Fig. 4).

### Accuracy Evaluation
- **Coverage and False Positive Rates**:
  - **Continuous Model**: High coverage rate, low false positive rate.
  - **Boolean Model**: Slightly lower accuracy due to the assumption of separable loss rates, which may not hold in practice (Table 1).

## Conclusion

- **Small Number of Beacons**: The Boolean model requires fewer direct measurements, but the difference is small.
- **Large Number of Beacons**: The continuous model requires fewer direct measurements, and the difference can be significant.
- **Very Large Number of Beacons**: No difference in the number of direct measurements required between the two models.

## Future Work
- **Routing Matrix Structure**: Investigating its influence on the differences between the models.
- **Probe Sending**: Exploring the impact of sending probes to non-monitoring system nodes.
