ogy. The results suggest that although all topologies exhibit the same tendencies
for the number of direct measurements in the continuous and Boolean model, ex-
act results in each network are sensitive to the network topology. We also observe
that for all three topologies, the percentages of required direct measurements for
both continuous and Boolean models drop rapidly with the number of beacons
when the latter is small. However, these percentages decrease slowly when the
number of beacons is large. This observation suggests that the beneﬁt of intro-
ducing additional beacons lessens with the increase of the number of beacons.
The above observations can be explained by the structure of a basis of a
vector space in (+,×) algebra and the basis of a vector span in Boolean algebra.
In the Boolean model, and contrary to the continuous model, if all links in a path
are also present in some other paths, then the ﬁrst path is redundant because it
is a linear combination of the other paths. When the number of paths is small,
this situation frequently occurs in the studied ISP networks. In (+,×) algebra,
the rank of a matrix is upper bounded by the minimum of the number of rows
and columns in the matrix. Hence, when we initially increase the number of
paths (i.e., the number of rows) the dimension of the basis rapidly increases.
But when the rank of the matrix approaches the number of columns, which
stays almost constant, it increases only slowly. When there are a lot of paths,
both the Boolean vector span and continuous vector space have the same basis
that contains mostly unit vectors (vectors that have only one 1 entry).

Internet Evaluation
In this section, we compare the performance of the continuous and the binary
models on the data collected from the NLANR’s AMP (Active Measurement
Binary Versus Analogue Path Monitoring in IP Networks

Project) [14] measurement infrastructure, which performs site-to-site active mea-
surements between campuses connected by high performance networks (most of
them at NSF-funded HPC-sites). The NLANR measurement infrastructure con-
sists of approximately 140 monitors and about 15,000 end-to-end paths. Each
monitor performs RTT, topology and throughput tests to all other monitors.
More details can be found at [14]. We have analyzed the data collected by AMP
on the 23rd of January, 2004. After grouping the common edges and nodes in all
end-to-end paths, we have a sample of 133 monitors and 17556 end-to-end paths
that cover 9405 nodes and 36674 directed edges. Note here that the number of
available monitors (133 monitors) is signiﬁcantly smaller than the number of
nodes (9405 nodes) in the systems. The AMP system is therefore operating in
the regime where only a small percentage (below 1.4%) of nodes are used as
beacons. To evaluate the eﬀect of the number of beacons on the two models, we
vary the number of beacons from 1 to 133, which corresponds to 0.01%-1.4%
of the total number of nodes. We then construct the routing matrix D and cal-
culate the rank of D to obtain the number of end-to-end measurements for the
continuous model. We also calculate the number of independent paths in the
Boolean model using the PS algorithm in [2]. The results are plotted in Fig. 4.
We observe that the results reﬂect the behaviors that we have already seen
for the Rocketfuel topologies. That is, in the regime where the percentage of
nodes that are used as beacons is very small (below 1% in this case) the Boolean
model requires fewer direct measurements if we are only interested in separable
“good” or “bad” performance of paths. However, the diﬀerence between the two
models is very small for this range, which can be explained by the fact that in
this case most of the end-to-end paths in the network are independent in both

models. We suspect that the diﬀerence becomes more important, and in favor of
the continuous model, for larger numbers of beacons. Furthermore, for both the
continuous and Boolean models the percentage of direct measurements drops
rapidly as the number of beacons increases.
We also evaluate the accuracy of the two approaches on predicting the quality
of unmeasured paths. For this purpose, we proceed as follows. First, we ﬁx the
number of beacons. We then determine the set of independent paths in the
continuous and Boolean models. We called these independent paths the directly
measured paths. Using performance data from these directly measured paths, we
calculate the performance on the unmeasured paths. That is, in the continuous
model, we calculate the loss rates on all unmeasured paths and compare them
against a loss threshold of 5%, which is the threshold between “tolerable loss”
and “serious loss” as deﬁned in [15], to determine whether the path is good
or bad. In the Boolean model, we ﬁrst determine the quality of the directly
measured paths and then calculate the quality on the unmeasured paths. We
compare the inferred results of the two models against the real measurement
data. The results are given in Table 1. We observe that both models achieve
a high coverage rate and a low false positive rate. The Boolean model is less
accurate than the continuous model because the Boolean model relies on the
assumption that the loss rates of network paths and links are separable, which
sometimes does not hold in practice.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have compared the performance of two end-to-end path mon-
itoring approaches. We show that when the number of beacons is small, the
Boolean model requires fewer direct measurements; but the diﬀerence appear to
be very small on real measurements. For a large number of beacons the contin-
uous model requires fewer direct measurements, and the diﬀerent can be quite
signiﬁcant. However, when the number of beacons is signiﬁcantly large, there is
no diﬀerence in terms of the number of paths that we need to measure directly
in both models. We verify the results by simulations on existing ISP topologies
and on real measurement infrastructure.
We are currently working on various extensions of this work. First, we are in-
vestigating the inﬂuence of the structure of the routing matrix on the diﬀerences
between the number of probes required for the continuous and Boolean models.
Second, so far in this work we have taken the restriction that nodes in the mon-
Binary Versus Analogue Path Monitoring in IP Networks
107
itoring systems can send probes only to other nodes in the monitoring systems.
However, since probes can be sent to many other nodes in the network, we are
investigating how sending probes to other nodes in the network would aﬀect the
eﬃciency of the monitoring system in both the continuous and Boolean models.
