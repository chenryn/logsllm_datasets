**Title: Processor Reliability Enhancement through Compiler-Directed Register File Peak Temperature Reduction**

**Authors: Chengmo Yang and Alex Orailoglu**

**Abstract:**
Each new generation of semiconductor technology brings us closer to the processor architecture heat wall, with significant adverse effects on system performance and reliability. Temperature hotspots not only accelerate physical failure mechanisms such as electromigration and dielectric breakdown but also make the system more vulnerable to timing-related intermittent failures. Traditional thermal management techniques often suffer from considerable performance overhead, as the entire processor needs to be stalled or slowed down to prevent heat accumulation. Given the significant temporal and spatial variations in chip-wide temperature, this paper proposes a technique that directly targets one of the resources most likely to overheat in current processors: the register file. Instead of duplicating or physically distributing the register file, we suggest controlling power density by exploiting the existing spatial slack associated with register file accesses. Based on application-specific access profiles, a compiler-directed register shuffling strategy is proposed to deterministically construct the logical-to-physical register mapping in a rotating manner. Simulation results confirm that the proposed technique effectively reduces peak temperature and, consequently, the expected fault rates for the entire chip, with minimal hardware overhead and negligible performance degradation.

**I. Introduction**
Advances in IC fabrication processes have enabled the integration of an increasing number of transistors on a single chip, but this has also brought us closer to the imminent processor architecture heat wall. The continuous scaling of circuit current, clock speed, and device density leads to significant temperature increases, which adversely degrade the performance and reliability of the chip. Previous studies show that higher temperatures accelerate the chemical processes inside the chip, making the system more vulnerable to various failure mechanisms such as electromigration, stress migration, and dielectric breakdown [1]. A mere 10–15°C rise in operating temperature can halve the lifespan of the circuit [2]. Additionally, temperature hotspots increase the occurrence of intermittent and transient faults during execution. Higher temperatures reduce the mobility of charge carriers, diminishing the switching speed of transistors. Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI) further cause violations of circuit timing constraints [3]. As reported in [4], delay fault rates double for each 10°C increase in temperature. Moreover, a 20°C increase in temperature causes a 5-6% increase in Elmore delay in interconnects, and clock skew problems become noticeable for temperature spatial variations of around 20°C and above [5].

These performance and reliability issues are exacerbated by the positive feedback loop between temperature and leakage power. Not only are the two positively correlated, but leakage current is exponentially related to temperature, further intensifying the effects of the positive feedback. Traditional packaging and cooling solutions typically target worst-case peak temperatures, resulting in extremely expensive packaging solutions as prevailing temperature levels rise (approximately $10 per Watt above 65°C). To keep the chip-wide temperature within the thermal capacity of the cooling package, system-level Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques become indispensable for both high-end general-purpose processors [6] and low-power embedded cores [7, 8]. These DTM techniques, such as clock gating [9], fetch toggling [10], and dynamic frequency and voltage scaling [6], control worst-case temperature by globally stalling or slowing down the computation of an overheated core, imposing significant performance deterioration.

Due to its high utilization (accessed 2–3 times per instruction) and relatively small area, the register file is one of the hardware units most likely to overheat in current processors [6]. This localized "hotspot" can reach critical temperature levels regardless of average or peak external package temperature, thus constraining the overall performance and reliability of the whole chip. More crucially, since 90% of the execution time is spent on loops where only a small subset of registers is repetitively accessed, register file accesses exhibit high asymmetry during program execution. This asymmetric register utilization leads to considerable temperature differentials, as most of the heat generated within a microarchitectural block is dissipated vertically to the heatsink rather than laterally to adjacent blocks [6].

The aforementioned register file access characteristics indicate that the peak temperature within the register file, the hottest spot of a modern processor, can be effectively controlled by minimizing the peak power density across the register file. This can be achieved by distributing the accesses uniformly throughout the register file. To achieve this goal, the register names obtained at the decode stage cannot be directly used to access the register file, as they would result in a highly asymmetric access distribution. Instead, we propose an iteration-based register shuffling technique that, through physical remapping of heavily accessed logical registers prior to local heat buildup, effectively controls the peak temperature.
