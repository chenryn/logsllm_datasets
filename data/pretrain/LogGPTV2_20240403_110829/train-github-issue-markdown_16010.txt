As Kubernetes moves to support more multi-tenant use cases and to increase
security in general, it would be helpful if there was a way to firewall pods
from other pods, ideally using something simple like labels.
Is there a preferred approach to support this use case? If this is implemented
via dynamic iptables rules, I assume it would need to be part of the pod
definition and kubelet rather than an external firewall service? Or perhaps
there are lessons learned at Google regarding how to best isolate
applications?
