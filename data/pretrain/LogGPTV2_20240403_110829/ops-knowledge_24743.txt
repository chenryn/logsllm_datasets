Question: Consider a scenario where a company is developing a new System-on-Chip (SoC) with a Root-of-Trust (RoT) implemented in ROM for secure booting. As an architect, you are tasked with proposing design strategies to mitigate the risk of immutable ROM code that could contain vulnerabilities. Which of the following strategies would be effective in addressing the risk associated with the inability to patch ROM code?
"A": "Incorporate secure patch support to allow ROM code to be patched on the next boot, understanding that certain hardware initialization aspects will remain unpatchable.",
"B": "Enable runtime patching capabilities by storing patch code in volatile memory, which can be updated continuously to respond to new vulnerabilities.",
"C": "Design the SoC to support hardware fuses, allowing for limited in-field or manufacturing patching of ROM code for the next batch of devices.",
"D": "Implement a dual-ROM system where one ROM is used for booting while the other contains updatable firmware that can override the first ROM's code."
