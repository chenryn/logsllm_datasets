User: I need to extract process details from top command on a few *nix systems I monitor. The details needed are username, command executed, PID, PPID, username and resident memory consumption.
If memory usage is greater than a threshold or command is illegal, I need to send a warning to the user at username@company.com
I am writing a script to do this in python and get the required data by executing 'top -bc -n 1' and grepping for command keyword. However, I also need to extract username for the illegal processes to send the mail warning. 
However, top automatically truncates usernames greater than 8 characters. How do I retrieve the full user names?
Assistant: Consider using ps instead of top as I don't know any reasons why top would be better for this task. You can configure ps output much more flexibly than top one.
