We are using the above spring version in our web application and it is runs on
3 node jboss 5.1.1 cluster with enabling session replication. But when
accessing our functionality, we are getting java.io.NotSerializableException:
javax.annotation.PostConstruct exception at the time of replicating session
over jboss nodes.
Found the https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5331 issue and it address
the same issue but we cannot see any solution given.
