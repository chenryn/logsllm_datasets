User: I created a Hello World website in Google App Engine. It is using Django 1.1 without any patch.
Even though it is just a very simple web page, it takes long time and often it times out.
Any suggestions to solve this?
Note: It is responding fast after the first call.
Assistant: I encounteres the same with pylons based app. I have the initial page server as static, and have a dummy ajax call in it to bring the app up, before the user types in credentials. It is usually enough to avoid a lengthy response... Just an idea that you might use before you actually have a million users ;).
