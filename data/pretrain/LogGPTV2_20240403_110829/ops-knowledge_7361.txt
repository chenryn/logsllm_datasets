User: Which is better to use in a python automation script for following simple operations
To create a zip file and copy it or rename it to a new location.
Using python inbuilt functions or terminal commands through os.system modules is better?
Assistant: The inbuilt Python modules/ stdlib wherever you can, subprocess (os.system) where you must.
Reasons: Portability, maintenance, code readability just to name a few.
