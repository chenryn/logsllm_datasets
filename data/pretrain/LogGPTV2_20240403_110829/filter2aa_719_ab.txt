# Non-Obvious Names and Knockoffs

## Chinese Knockoff Products
Some notable examples of Chinese knockoff products include:
- **HiPhone** or **APhone A6**: These devices run on Android Jelly Bean, despite their names suggesting otherwise.

## Manufacturer Part Numbers and Board Markings
- **TBD (To Be Determined)**: Further details to be provided.

## FCC IDs
### Overview
- **FCC IDs** are required for almost all modern electronic devices due to potential RF emissions during operation.
- Devices with a radio transmitter will always have an FCC ID.

### Accessing FCC IDs
- **Database**: You can find the FCC ID in a comprehensive database at [Transition.fcc.gov](http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/).
- **Structure**: FCC IDs consist of two parts:
  - **Grantee Code**: The first three letters.
  - **Product Code**: The remaining characters.

### Example
- **iPad Mini**: FCC ID **BCGA1455**
  - **Search Results**: Searching this ID yields 26 results.
  - **Detailed Information**: Clicking the top entry provides all filing documents.
  - **Internal Documents**: For example, "Internal 2" shows detailed internal components.
  - **Additional Information**: These documents often include user manuals, diagrams, and drawings.

### No Board Numbers?
- **Chip Identification**: Remember that chips generally do not lie.
- **Cataloging Chips**: Take multiple photos of the board and catalog the chips.
- **Custom Chips**: Many custom chips are excess stock and can be found on eBay or chip wholesalers.
- **Example**: A device labeled "Spansion" is likely a NAND flash EEPROM device.

## How to Get Chip Information
### Private Market Chips
- **Manufacturers**: Often market private parts similar to their public-market chips.
- **Example**: Marvell makes silicon devices for Seagate, Western Digital, and Samsung. These "private chips" are usually embedded ARM processors with additional memory and I/O peripherals (Marvell uses an 88i prefix code).

### Deriving Information
- **Similar Chips**: Information about a given chip can often be derived from similar chips by the same manufacturer.
- **NRE Cost**: Manufacturers aim to reuse designs to reduce non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs.
- **JTAG and BDM Ports**: You can identify the location of JTAG or BDM ports, voltage pins, addressing, data bus connections, etc.
- **Educated Guesses**: You can make educated guesses about whether a chip might be a SPI Flash or I2C EEPROM device.

### Public Sources
- **Google**: A common resource for information.
- **Mouser and DigiKey**: Online distributors with extensive catalogs.
- **Manufacturer Websites**: Direct source for detailed information.
- **Contacting Manufacturers**: Salespeople are often willing to discuss their products; use social engineering skills effectively.

### Identifying Components
- **Logos**: Look for logos on the chips (used to save space).
- **Visual Directories**: Use visual directories such as:
  - [How-to Wiki](http://how-to.wikia.com/wiki/Howto_identify_integrated_circuit_(chip)_manufacturers_by_their_logos/all_logos)
  - [Advanced-Tech](http://www.advanced-tech.com/ic_logos/ic_logos.htm)

### Additional Steps
- **Examine Board Components**: If you still cannot find information, examine all board components.
- **Power Feed**: Trace the power feed to the PMIC (power regulation components).
- **Ground Plane**: Identify the ground plane to help identify chips by pinout.

### Common Layouts
- **SPI and I2C Chips**: 
  - **VSS (Ground) and VCC/VDD (Positive)**: Typically, pins 4 and 8 are Ground and VCC.
  - **Write Protection**: If a chip has a write protection pin connected to Vcc through a 4.7k Ohm resistor, it is likely a SPI flash ROM. This allows the chip to remain writable for firmware updates.

### Estimating Device Functionality
- **Power Conservation System**: Determine if the device is a power conservation system.
- **Fully Functional Computer**: Assess if it is a fully functional computer.
- **IO Sub-Processor**: Check if it is an IO sub-processor from a VAX.
- **Mystery Meat**: If none of the above, it may be a "mystery meat" device.
- **Date Consideration**: Consider the date the chip was introduced to the market, its production status, and any known weaknesses (e.g., clock glitching, power glitching, differential current draw analysis, side-channel attacks).

## Physical Attacks
### Epoxy Removal
- **Epoxy**: An adhesive, plastic, paint, or other material made from synthetic thermosetting polymers containing epoxide groups.
- **Removal Challenges**: Epoxy is difficult to remove after it dries and may contain dangerous chemicals.
- **Chemicals Used**: Polyfunctional amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols, and thiols are used to remove various epoxies. **DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME**.
- **Safety Tips**:
  - Work in a well-ventilated area.
  - Use a fireproof environment.
  - Test on a device, not the one you need to get information from.
  - Work with a buddy.
  - Use a respirator.
  - Be aware of potential DMCA violations.

### Heat Removal
- **Simplest Method**: Using heat to remove epoxy.
- **Principles**:
  - **Thermal Differential**: Causes micro-fracturing between the board and the epoxy.
  - **Relaxation of Bonds**: Most bonding agents relax their homopolymerization bonds under heat.
