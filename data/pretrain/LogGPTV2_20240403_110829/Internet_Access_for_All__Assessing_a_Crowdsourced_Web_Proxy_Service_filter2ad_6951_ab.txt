### User and Proxy Interactions

The selection of a web proxy is influenced by social factors and the reputation of each proxy. In most cases, users initially choose the nearest operational proxy with acceptable availability or reputation. Typically, several nearby web proxy services are configured in client web browsers. Since all federated proxies use the same authentication service, users can freely select their preferred proxy. The choice of proxy is generally fixed and prioritized, switching to lower-priority proxies only when the first choice fails to respond.

### User and Proxy Distribution

Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of the average number of users per hour across different proxies. The various proxies exhibit similar distributions, with the exception of proxy 10473, which has a unique demand pattern. This proxy experiences 40% of its time without any users and a maximum of 10 users per hour. The other proxies, for the majority of the time (60%), have an almost linear distribution of users between 5 and 25, with an average of around 17 users per hour for proxies 11252 and 18202, and an average of 12 users for proxy 3982. The differences in user distribution among proxies can be attributed to preferences for proximity and manual selection. On average, there are 10 users in periods of 10 seconds, 76 different users per proxy per day, and a maximum of 254 users in a month.

### Request Distribution

The distribution of the number of requests, as shown in Figure 4, is influenced by the user distribution among proxies. The ordering of proxies according to the number of users is reflected in the distribution of requests. For proxies 11252 and 18202, the number of requests per hour typically ranges from 1,000 to 10,000, with means of 8,187 and 6,716, respectively. For proxy 3982, the typical values range from 500 to 1,000 requests per hour.

### Client Proximity and Preferences

The number of clients seen by a proxy daily varies, with the lowest values in proxy 10473 (14, 20, 27) and the highest in proxy 3982 (59, 82, 101). These numbers reflect the nature of a highly decentralized service with many small-capacity local proxies.

### Internet Connection and Processing Performance

Figure 5 shows the distribution of internet connection usage per proxy, calculated as the approximate instantaneous connection throughput normalized by the maximum internet throughput. All proxies show low utilization of their network resources, with usage below 0.3 (30%) for 80% of the time. However, proxies 11252 and 18202 experience significantly higher traffic. Figure 6 presents the distributions of request processing throughput, indicating that all proxies have nearly identical distributions but with different mean values based on individual characteristics. A significant percentage (>60%) of the time, proxies serve at a very narrow range of processing throughput, suggesting stable service. Even in the worst cases, the service maintains a throughput higher than 100 Kbps for 80% of the time.

### Daily Aggregates and Patterns

To gain a more comprehensive perspective, we analyzed the daily aggregates of traffic, users, and requests. We observed not only the expected human daily patterns but also the effects of different proxy selections. The processing throughput, as seen in Figure 7, shows minimal variations, indicating stable service behavior. The traffic volume varies by more than 1.5 orders of magnitude, but the processing throughput remains unaffected, confirming that the servers are not saturated. To verify the processing capabilities of the proxies, we monitored CPU usage using the Linux `loadavg` metric. The results, summarized in Figure 8, show a strong daily cyclic pattern, with brief daily peaks due to the daily restart and cache reindexing of the proxies.

### Network Structure and Usage

The local network infrastructure also influences the final user experience. We used logs to analyze the network structure, including the base graph, proxy-clients graph, and backbone graph. The mean degree of the base graph and proxy-clients graph is low, dominated by end-nodes. The backbone graph, with a low mean degree, indicates that most routers have only two neighbors. Figures 9 and 10 provide visualizations of the proxy-clients graph and the backbone graph, with colors indicating the proxy being used and link darkness denoting latency costs.

### Local Network Metrics

The analysis of local network usage, particularly the distance between users and proxies, reveals that 95% of users experience a uniform distribution of hops ranging from 1 to 6, with the remaining 5% experiencing 7 to 8 hops. Despite this, 80% of users experience an average latency of less than 15 ms, with the remaining 20% experiencing latencies between 20 ms and 35 ms. This suggests that, under normal conditions, the distance between users and proxies does not significantly deteriorate the user experience for web services.

### Download Throughput

We estimated the user experience in terms of download throughput for objects larger than 1 MB. Median values of download throughput range from 0.1 Mbps to 10 Mbps for different users, indicating a good result for a free crowdsourced service. Simulations of user traffic using minimum hop and random strategies showed that manual selection is asymptotically better than random selection but worse than minimum hop selection. This suggests that a proxy selection mechanism could improve the user experience.

### Related Work

Most studies on wireless networks focus on usage traffic patterns, link-level characteristics, and topologies rather than user experience. Our study, which uses proxies, shows higher performance compared to similar studies, such as MadMesh, Google WiFi, and Meraki. Facebook’s Free Basics, while comparable in some aspects, differs in terms of client devices, access networks, and content providers.

### Summary of Lessons Learned

The analysis of the guiﬁ.net proxy service highlights a crowdsourced, socially driven, free basic internet service built from many small proxy servers spread across a regional community network. These proxies act as gateways to web content and DNS, supporting caching and HTTPS transfers. The service has satisfactory performance, with no perceived congestion, attributed to the structure of many small servers close to end-users. Future work will explore optimization through automated service selection with a global perspective.
