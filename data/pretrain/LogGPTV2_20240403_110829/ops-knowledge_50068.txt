Assistant: This log chunk shows the QuorumCnxManager software component attempting to establish connections with other nodes. It begins by interrupting the SendWorker, then receives connection requests from various IP addresses. It then breaks the connection for id 188978561024, and continues to receive connection requests. The SendWorker is interrupted multiple times while waiting for messages on the queue, and eventually leaves the thread. The log ends with the QuorumCnxManager receiving two more connection requests.
