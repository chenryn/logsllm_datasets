User: I'm trying to use virtualenv on my development machine. I successfully created my new environment issuing virtualenv venv in /home/user/. When I try to activate it (from user location) with sudo venv/bin/activate I get venv/bin/activate: command not found.
Assistant: You don't run activate as a script; you need to source it in your shell, since it affects the shell itself.
It probably also doesn't make any sense to run it under sudo.
