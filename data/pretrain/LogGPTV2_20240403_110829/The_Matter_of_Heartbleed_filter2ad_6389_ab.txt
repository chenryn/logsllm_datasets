## 3.3.1 Top 100 Websites
All of the Alexa Top 100 websites were patched within 48 hours of the Heartbleed disclosure, prior to the start of our scans. To document the impact on these websites, we aggregated press releases, targeted scans, and quotes provided to Mashable, a news site that hosted one of the popular lists of sites for which users should change their passwords due to possible exposure via Heartbleed [10].

Al-Bassam completed a vulnerability scan of the Alexa Top 10,000 domains on April 8, 2014, at 16:00 UTC (22 hours after the vulnerability disclosure) [20]. His scan found 630 vulnerable sites, 3,687 supporting HTTPS but not vulnerable, and 5,683 not supporting HTTPS. Several prominent sites, including Yahoo, Imgur, Stack Overflow, Flickr, Sogou, OkCupid, and DuckDuckGo, were found to be vulnerable. We investigated other sites in the Alexa Top 100 and found that half made a public statement regarding vulnerability or provided information to Mashable [8, 10, 18–21, 23, 26, 28, 33, 39, 40, 50, 58, 61, 68, 69, 71, 73, 74].

Combining these press releases, Mashable’s report, and Al-Bassam’s scan, we found that at least 44 of the Alexa Top 100 websites were vulnerable. However, this figure reflects a lower bound, as we were unable to find information for some sites. Table 3 lists the vulnerability status of the top 30 HTTPS-enabled sites in the US.

## 3.3.2 Estimating Broader Impact
Within 48 hours of the initial disclosure, we conducted our first vulnerability scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million. At that point, we found that 45% of all sites supported HTTPS. Of those, 60% supported the Heartbeat Extension, and 11% of all HTTPS sites were vulnerable. While 60% of HTTPS sites supported the extension, 91% of these were powered by known vulnerable web servers (e.g., Nginx or Apache Web Server), as shown in Table 4. If all of these servers were initially vulnerable and operators installed a patched OpenSSL version (rather than rebuilding OpenSSL with Heartbeat disabled), at most about 55% of the HTTPS sites in the Alexa Top 1 Million were initially vulnerable.

Disabling the largely unused extension would appear to provide an obvious solution, but it is not possible to disable the extension through a configuration file. Instead, this change requires recompiling OpenSSL with a specific flag—an option likely more laborious than updating the OpenSSL software package.

Some sites may have used an older version of OpenSSL that was not vulnerable. To estimate a lower bound for the number of vulnerable sites, we considered sites that used vulnerable web servers and supported TLS 1.1 and 1.2—features first introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.1 along with the Heartbeat Extension. Such sites would have been vulnerable unless administrators had recompiled OpenSSL to explicitly disable the extension.

To estimate the number of sites that supported TLS 1.1 and 1.2 prior to the Heartbleed disclosure, we analyzed the data collected by the Trustworthy Internet Movement’s SSL Pulse [16], which provides monthly statistics of SSL-enabled websites within the Alexa Top 1 Million. We found that 56,019 of the 171,608 (32.6%) sites in the SSL Pulse dataset supported TLS 1.1 or 1.2. Of these sites, 72.7% used known vulnerable web servers, yielding an estimated lower bound of 23.7% of the sites being vulnerable.

In summary, we can reasonably bound the proportion of vulnerable Alexa Top 1 Million HTTPS-enabled websites as lying between 24–55% at the time of the Heartbleed disclosure.

### Table 4: Alexa Top 1 Million Web Servers
| Web Server | Alexa Sites | Heartbeat Ext. | Vulnerable |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Apache | 451,270 (47.3%) | 95,217 (58.4%) | 28,548 (64.4%) |
| Nginx | 182,379 (19.1%) | 46,450 (28.5%) | 11,185 (25.2%) |
| Microsoft IIS | 96,259 (10.1%) | 637 (0.4%) | 195 (0.4%) |
| LiteSpeed | 17,597 (1.8%) | 6,838 (4.2%) | 1,601 (3.6%) |
| Other | 76,817 (8.1%) | 5,383 (3.3%) | 962 (2.2%) |
| Unknown | 129,006 (13.5%) | 8,545 (5.2%) | 1,833 (4.1%) |

## 3.4 Pre-Disclosure Patching
Google, Akamai, and other sites disabled the Heartbeat Extension prior to public disclosure. To detect when services disabled the Heartbeat Extension, we examined data from the ICSI Certificate Notary, which passively monitors TLS connections from seven research and university networks (approximately 314K active users) [22].

The Notary data shows that Google disabled Heartbeat starting at least 12 days prior to public disclosure, with all servers Heartbeat-disabled by April 15. While some servers still had Heartbeat enabled after disclosure, they may not have been exploitable. Google may have already patched those servers and decided afterwards to disable the Heartbeat Extension as a company-wide policy. Similarly, Akamai began disabling Heartbeat at least 4 days prior to disclosure, completing the process by April 18.

## 3.5 Internet-Wide HTTPS Vulnerability
We began performing daily 1% scans of the IPv4 address space on April 9, 48 hours after the disclosure. Our first scan found that 11.4% of HTTPS hosts supported the Heartbeat Extension and 5.9% of all HTTPS hosts were vulnerable. Combining these proportions from random sampling with our daily scans of the HTTPS ecosystem [29] (which do not include Heartbleed vulnerability testing), we estimate that 2.0 million HTTPS hosts were vulnerable two days after disclosure.

Surprisingly, 10 ASes accounted for over 50% of vulnerable HTTPS hosts but represented only 8.6% of all HTTPS hosts (Figure 2). With the exception of Comcast Cable Communications, the ASes all belonged to web hosting companies or cloud providers (Table 5). The vulnerable hosts in the Comcast AS were Fortinet devices. In the case of Strato Hosting, vulnerable addresses were hosting Parallels Plesk Panel, a web hosting management software. The vulnerable addresses of Minotavar Computers, ZeXoTeK IT-Services, Euclid Systems, Vivid Hosting, and ACCESSPEOPLE-DE all served the default Apache page, likely reflecting named-based virtual hosts. In the case of the two Amazon ASes and Hetzner Online, a large number of the vulnerable hosts served public-facing websites and used Apache or Nginx.

### Table 5: Top ASes with Most Vulnerable Hosts
| AS | % of Vulnerable | % of HTTPS |
|----|-----------------|------------|
| Minotavar Computers EOOD | 1.7% | 18.5% |
| ZeXoTeK IT-Services GmbH | 0.9% | 13.0% |
| ACCESSPEOPLE-DE ISP-Service | 0.7% | 7.4% |
| Amazon.com, Inc. | 0.8% | 4.6% |
| Amazon.com, Inc. | 0.9% | 4.1% |
| Hetzner Online AG | 0.4% | 2.6% |
| Comcast Cable Communications | 2.8% | 2.3% |
| Vivid Hosting | 0.1% | 2.0% |
| Euclid Systems | 0.1% | 1.5% |
| Strato Hosting | 0.1% | 1.4% |
| Total | 8.6% | 57.4% |

## 3.6 Vulnerable Devices and Products
Heartbleed also affected many embedded systems, including printers, firewalls, VPN endpoints, NAS devices, video conferencing systems, and security cameras. To understand the embedded systems that were affected, we analyzed the self-signed certificates employed by vulnerable hosts. We clustered these by fields in the certificate Subject and manually inspected large clusters. From this, we developed device "fingerprints". We took a conservative approach and chose the most restrictive fingerprints to minimize false positive identifications. This, and the manual effort required, means that our fingerprints lack comprehensive coverage. However, we still identified 74 distinct sets of vulnerable devices and software packages that fall into a number of broad categories:

### Communication Servers
- IceWarp messaging
- Zimbra collaboration servers
- iPECS VoIP systems
- Polycom and Cisco video conference products

### Software Control Panels
- Puppet Enterprise Dashboard
- IBM System X Integrated Management Modules
- Kloxo Web hosting control panel
- PowerMTA
- Chef/Opscode management consoles
- VMWare servers
- Parallels control panels for Plesk and Confixx

### Network Attached Storage

- D-Link
- ReadyNAS
- LaCie
- Synology
- Western Digital NAS devices

### Firewall and VPN Devices
