Table 2: Vulnerable Server Products. We survey which server products were affected by Heartbleed.
3.3.1 Top 100 Websites
All of the Alexa Top 100 websites were patched within 48 hours
of disclosure—prior to the start of our scans. To document the
impact on these websites, we aggregated press releases, other’s
targeted scans, and quotes provided to Mashable, a news site that
hosted one of the popular lists of sites for which users should change
their passwords due to possible exposure via Heartbleed [10].
Al-Bassam completed a vulnerability scan of the Alexa Top
10,000 domains on April 8, 2014 at 16:00 UTC (22 hours af-
ter the vulnerability disclosure) [20]. His scan found 630 vul-
nerable sites, 3,687 supporting HTTPS but not vulnerable, and
5,683 not supporting HTTPS. Several prominent sites, includ-
ing Yahoo, Imgur, Stack Overﬂow, Flickr, Sogou, OkCupid, and
DuckDuckGo, were found vulnerable. We investigated other sites
in the Alexa Top 100 and found that half made a public state-
ment regarding vulnerability or provided information to Mash-
able [8, 10, 18–21, 23, 26, 28, 33, 39, 40, 50, 58, 61, 68, 69, 71, 73, 74].
Combining these press releases, Mashable’s report, and Al-Bassam’s
scan, we ﬁnd that at least 44 of the Alexa Top 100 websites were
vulnerable. However, this ﬁgure reﬂects a lower bound, as we
were unable to ﬁnd information for some sites. Table 3 lists the
vulnerability status of the top 30 HTTPS-enabled sites in the US.

Table 3: Vulnerability of Top 30 US HTTPS-Enabled Websites.
We aggregate published lists of vulnerable sites, press releases, and
news sources to determine which of the top sites were vulnerable
before the discovery of Heartbleed.
3.3.2 Estimating Broader Impact
Within 48 hours of the initial disclosure, we conducted our ﬁrst
vulnerability scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million. At that point, we
found that 45% of all sites supported HTTPS. 60% of those sup-
ported the Heartbeat Extension, and 11% of all HTTPS sites were
vulnerable. While 60% of HTTPS sites supported the extension,
91% of these were powered by known vulnerable web servers (e.g.,
Nginx or Apache Web Server), as shown in Table 4. If all of these
servers were initially vulnerable and operators installed a patched
OpenSSL version (rather than rebuilding OpenSSL with Heartbeat
disabled), at most about 55% of the HTTPS sites in the Alexa Top
1 Million were initially vulnerable.
While disabling the largely unused extension would appear to
provide an obvious solution, it is not possible to disable the ex-
tension through a conﬁguration ﬁle. Instead, this change requires
recompiling OpenSSL with a speciﬁc ﬂag—an option likely more
laborious than updating the OpenSSL software package.
Some sites may possibly have used an older version of OpenSSL
that was not vulnerable. To estimate a lower bound for the number
of vulnerable sites, we considered sites that used vulnerable web
servers and supported TLS 1.1 and 1.2—features ﬁrst introduced
in OpenSSL 1.0.1 along with the Heartbeat Extension. Such sites
would have been vulnerable unless administrators had recompiled
OpenSSL to explicitly disable the extension.
To estimate the number of sites that supported TLS 1.1 and 1.2
prior to the Heartbleed disclosure, we analyzed the data collected
by the Trustworthy Internet Movement’s SSL Pulse [16], which pro-
vides monthly statistics of SSL-enabled websites within the Alexa
Top 1 Million. We ﬁnd that 56,019 of the 171,608 (32.6%) sites
in the SSL Pulse dataset supported TLS 1.1 or 1.2. Of these sites,
72.7% used known vulnerable web servers, yielding an estimated
lower bound of 23.7% of the sites being vulnerable.
In summary, we can reasonably bound the proportion of vulnera-
ble Alexa Top 1 Million HTTPS-enabled websites as lying between
24–55% at the time of the Heartbleed disclosure.

servers used by the Alexa Top 1 Million Sites, as observed in our
ﬁrst scan on April 9, 2014. Percentages represent the breakdown
of server products for each category. We note that while Microsoft
IIS was not vulnerable to Heartbleed, a small number of IIS servers
used vulnerable SSL terminators.
3.4 Pre-Disclosure Patching
Google, Akamai, and other sites disabled the Heartbeat Exten-
sion prior to public disclosure. To detect when services disabled
the Heartbeat Extension, we examined data from the ICSI Cer-
tiﬁcate Notary, which passively monitors TLS connections from
478seven research and university networks (approximately 314K active
users) [22].
The Notary data shows that Google disabled Heartbeat starting at
least 12 days prior to public disclosure, with all servers Heartbeat-
disabled by April 15. While some servers still had Heartbeat enabled
after disclosure, they may not have been exploitable. Google may
have already patched those servers, and decided afterwards to dis-
able the Heartbeat Extension as a company-wide policy. Similarly,
Akamai began disabling Heartbeat at least 4 days prior to disclosure,
completing the process by April 18.
3.5
Internet-Wide HTTPS Vulnerability
We began performing daily 1% scans of the IPv4 address space
on April 9, 48 hours after the disclosure. Our ﬁrst scan found that
11.4% of HTTPS hosts supported the Heartbeat Extension and 5.9%
of all HTTPS hosts were vulnerable. Combining these proportions
from random sampling with our daily scans of the HTTPS ecosys-
tem [29] (which do not include Heartbleed vulnerability testing),
we estimate that 2.0 million HTTPS hosts were vulnerable two days
after disclosure.
Surprisingly, 10 ASes accounted for over 50% of vulnerable
HTTPS hosts but represented only 8.6% of all HTTPS hosts (Fig-
ure 2). With the exception of Comcast Cable Communications, the
ASes all belonged to web hosting companies or cloud providers
(Table 5). The vulnerable hosts in the Comcast AS were Fortinet
devices. In the case of Strato Hosting, vulnerable addresses were
hosting Parallels Plesk Panel, a web hosting management software.
The vulnerable addresses of Minotavar Computers, ZeXoTeK IT-
Services, Euclid systems, Vivid Hosting, and ACCESSPEOPLE-DE
all served the default Apache page, likely reﬂecting named-based
virtual hosts. In the case of the two Amazon ASes and Hetzner
Online, a large number of the vulnerable hosts served public facing
websites, and used Apache or Nginx.

scan were located in only 10 ASes.
3.6 Vulnerable Devices and Products
Heartbleed also affected many embedded systems, including print-
ers, ﬁrewalls, VPN endpoints, NAS devices, video conferencing
systems, and security cameras. To understand the embedded systems
that were affected, we analyzed the self-signed certiﬁcates employed
by vulnerable hosts. We clustered these by ﬁelds in the certiﬁcate
Subject and manually inspected large clusters. From this, we devel-
oped device “ﬁngerprints”. We took a conservative approach and
chose the most restrictive ﬁngerprints in order to minimize false
positive identiﬁcations. This, and the manual effort required, means
that our ﬁngerprints lack comprehensive coverage. However, we
