3.4 When Sampled Traces are Available
Not always are packet-level traces available from the network.
Often only sampled ﬂow-level traces are available, e.g., collected
using Cisco’s Netflow. This is particularly the case for the
network core, where collecting all packets traversing a high speed
link is either infeasible or highly impractical. While it is well-
known that sampled traces can cause problems to anomaly detec-
tion algorithms (e.g., [33]), sampled data can create even more sig-
niﬁcant problems to trafﬁc classiﬁcation tools, such as BLINC, as
well. The key problem is that due to sampling, insufﬁcient amount
of data remains in the trace, and hence the graphlets approach sim-
ply does not work.

Sampling rate
Figure 4: IP addresses
This is not the case for the endpoint approach. The key reason
is that popular endpoints are still present in the trace, despite sam-
pling. Thus, classiﬁcation capabilities remain high. Figure 4 shows
the percent of IPs (both all IPs and popular 5% ones) as a function
of the sampling rate. In particular, we create sampled version of
the Asian and S. American traces by randomly selecting packets
with a given probability, the way Netflow would do it. For ex-
ample, for sampling rate of 50, the probability to select a packet is
1/50. The ﬁgure clearly reveals that the percent of IPs present in
the trace decreases as the sampling rate increases (e.g., at sampling
rate 100, 20% of of IPs remain in the trace relative to no sampling
case). Still, the key observation is that the most popular IPs, which
are critically needed for the endpoint approach, do stay in the trace,
and only marginally decrease as the sampling rate increases.

Sampling rate
Figure 5: Classiﬁed trafﬁc with the point x=1 representing non-
sampled packet-level trafﬁc
Figure 5 shows the classiﬁcation results as a function of the
sampling rate. The ﬁrst observation is that the endpoint approach
remains largely unaffected by sampling.
Indeed, the percent of
classiﬁed trafﬁc drops only marginally. This is exactly due to the
slight drop in the percent of popular IPs at high sampling rates.
At the same time, BLINC’s performance dramatically degrades as
the sampling rate increases, for the reasons explained above.
In
particular, at sampling rate 40, the classiﬁcation rate drops below
5%, and for the rate of 100, it becomes close to zero. In fact, even
at sampling rate of 100, the endpoint approach identiﬁes all the
classes of trafﬁc whereas BLINC is completely unable to identify
any class (see Table 5).8 Finally, worth noting is that the endpoint
approach shows consistent results for our third trace (again around
60%). We do not show it in Figure 5 because it is a Netﬂow trace
with the sampling rate of 1:200.
4. ENDPOINT PROFILING
Next, we apply our methodology to answer the following ques-
tions: (i) how can we cluster endpoints that show alike access pat-
terns and how similar or different are these classes for different
world regions, and (ii) where do clients fetch content from, i.e.,
how local or international are clients’ access patterns for these re-
gions? In all scenarios, we utilize the maximum possible informa-
tion that we have, and apply our approach accordingly. When no
traces are available (Europe), we stick with pure endpoint approach
(Section 3.2). When packet level traces are available (Asia and S.
America), we apply the endpoint approach as explained is Section
3.3. Finally, when ﬂow level traces are available (N. America), we
apply the approach from Section 3.4.
4.1 Endpoint Clustering
4.1.1 Algorithm
First, we introduce an algorithm we selected to perform end-
point clustering. The key objective of such clustering is to better
understand endpoints’ behavior at a large scale in different world
regions. Employing clustering in networking has been done before
(e.g., [22, 25, 46]). We select the autoclass algorithm [21], mainly
because it provides unsupervised clustering. This means that, in a
Bayesian manner, it can actually infer the different classes from the
input data and classify the given inputs with a certain probability
into one of these classes. The autoclass algorithm selects the opti-
mal number of classes and also the deﬁnition of these classes using
8Due to sampling, the % of ﬂows in classes may change; accord-
ingly, it is possible that the % of classiﬁed ﬂows in a given class
increases relative to the non-sampled case.
a Bayesian maximum posterior probability criterion. In addition
to accurate clustering, the algorithm also provides a ranking of the
variables according to their signiﬁcance in generating the classiﬁ-
cation.
For each of the regions we explore, input to the endpoint clus-
tering algorithm is a set of tagged IP addresses from the region’s
network. Since in this case we are interested in the access behavior
of users in the network, we determine the tags via an extension of
the mapping in Table 4. For regions with traces, if an in-network
IP address sends/receives trafﬁc to/from an out-network IP address
which is tagged by a server tag, e.g., as website, then the in-
network address is tagged appropriately (using the mapping from
column 2 to 3 in the table) as browsing. For regions with no trace
(Europe), if an in-network IP address has a client tag found via the
endpoint method, then it is tagged via the mapping from column 1
to 3 in the table and we also note the URL9of the site where the tag
was obtained from. Thus, the in-network IP addresses are tagged
as browsing, chat, mail, p2p, ftp, streaming, gaming, malware or
combination thereof. The sample set for the explored networks
is around 4,000 in-network IP addresses for all regions except N.
American, where we gather about 21,000 addresses.
