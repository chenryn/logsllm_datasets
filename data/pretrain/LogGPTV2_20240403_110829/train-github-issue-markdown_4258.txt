# Bug Report

### Current Behavior
When installing Webpack version 4.8.1 in a development environment, it includes an outdated dependency of `deep-extend` with a known vulnerability (see [Snyk report](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:deep-extend:20180409)). The path to the vulnerable package is as follows:
```
webpack > watchpack > chokidar > fsevents > node-pre-gyp > rc > deep-extend
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Ensure you have Node.js version 9.7.1 installed.
2. Create a new project or navigate to an existing one.
3. Add Webpack 4.8.1 as a dev dependency by running:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack@4.8.1
   ```
4. Run a security scan using a tool like Snyk to identify the `deep-extend` vulnerability.

### Expected Behavior
Webpack should not include any dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
