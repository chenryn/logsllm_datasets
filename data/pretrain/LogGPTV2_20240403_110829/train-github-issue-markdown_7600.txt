### Issue with `@types/styled-components` and `@types/react-native`

**Summary:**
I encountered several type conflicts when using `@types/styled-components` version 4.1.9 and above in a React web project. These conflicts are related to the inclusion of `@types/react-native` as a dependency, which introduces global type declarations that conflict with existing types in my project.

**Environment:**
- TypeScript (tsc): v3.4.3
- styled-components: v4.2.0
- @types/styled-components: v4.1.9 and above

**Errors:**
The following errors occur during the build process:

1. **Error in `@types/react-native/globals.d.ts`:**
   - Line 210: 
     ```typescript
     TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. Property 'onloadstart' must be of type '((this: XMLHttpRequest, ev: ProgressEvent) => any) | null', but here has type '((this: XMLHttpRequest, ev: Event) => any) | null'.
     ```
   - Line 211:
     ```typescript
     TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. Property 'onprogress' must be of type '((this: XMLHttpRequest, ev: ProgressEvent) => any) | null', but here has type '((this: XMLHttpRequest, ev: Event) => any) | null'.
     ```
   - Line 212:
     ```typescript
     TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. Property 'ontimeout' must be of type '((this: XMLHttpRequest, ev: ProgressEvent) => any) | null', but here has type '((this: XMLHttpRequest, ev: Event) => any) | null'.
     ```
   - Line 243:
     ```typescript
     TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'XMLHttpRequestResponseType'.
     ```

2. **Error in `@types/react-native/index.d.ts`:**
   - Line 9542:
     ```typescript
     TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. Property 'geolocation' must be of type 'Geolocation', but here has type 'GeolocationStatic'.
     ```
   - Line 9545:
     ```typescript
     TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'navigator'.
     ```

**Observations:**
- The errors do not occur with `@types/styled-components` version 4.1.8.
- The package.json for `@types/styled-components` changed from version 4.1.8 to 4.1.9, adding `@types/react-native` as a dependency.

**Package.json Comparison:**
- **v4.1.8:**
  ```json
  "dependencies": {
      "@types/node": "*",
      "@types/react": "*",
      "csstype": "^2.2.0"
  }
  ```
- **v4.1.9:**
  ```json
  "dependencies": {
      "@types/react": "*",
      "@types/react-native": "*",
      "csstype": "^2.2.0"
  }
  ```

**Questions:**
1. What is the root cause of these type conflicts?
2. Is there a way to configure TypeScript to exclude or ignore transitive dependencies like `@types/react-native` in my project?
