TS v3.4.3  
styled-components v4.2.0  
@types/styled-components v4.1.9 and above
In every version since v4.1.9 I get a lot of errors about `@types/react-
native/global.d.ts` on build - I've copied a few of these below.
I'm using styled-components in a React web project. From digging around I
think that these conflicts are caused by react-native declaring types globally
that conflict with types in node/the dom.

With version 4.1.8 of @types/styled-components, I don't get these errors.
I noticed from 4.1.8 -> 4.1.9 package.json incuded `@types/react-native` in
dependencies and this is very likely related, I'd assume.
v4.1.8
     "dependencies": {
        "@types/node": "*",
        "@types/react": "*",
        "csstype": "^2.2.0"
      },
v4.1.9
    "dependencies": {
        "@types/react": "*",
        "@types/react-native": "*",
        "csstype": "^2.2.0"
    },
I guess I'm fine just sticking on 4.1.8 but just curious as to what the cause
of this is? Do I need to change my own typescript config in some way to tell
it not to include transitive dependencies on react-native?
