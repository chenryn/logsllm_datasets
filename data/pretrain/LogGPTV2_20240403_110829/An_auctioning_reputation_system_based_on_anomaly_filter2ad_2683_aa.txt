### Abstract
Existing reputation systems used by online auction houses, such as eBay, do not address the concern of buyers seeking good bargains. These systems do not provide information on the practices adopted by sellers to ensure profitable auctions, which may be legitimate (e.g., setting a minimum starting bid) or fraudulent (e.g., using shill bidders to inflate prices). We develop a reputation system that helps buyers identify sellers whose auctions seem price-inflated. Our system is based on statistical models that characterize sellers according to metrics related to price inflation. We combine these models with anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious sellers. The output of our system is a set of values for each seller, representing the confidence with which the system can say that the seller's auctions are price-inflated.

We evaluate our reputation system on 604 high-volume sellers who posted 37,525 auctions on eBay. Our system automatically pinpoints sellers whose auctions contain potential shill bidders. Manual analysis of these sellers' auctions reveals that many winning bids are close to the items' market values, thus undercutting a buyer's ability to find a bargain and demonstrating the effectiveness of our reputation system.

### Introduction
Online auction houses, such as eBay, have become a convenient way to buy and sell items over the Internet. eBay alone has over 147 million registered users who posted over 431 million new listings in the first quarter of 2005. The presence and influence of such auction houses have been acknowledged by traditional retailers, who now use them to promote and sell their products. Although online auctions sell commodities also available from traditional retailers, the opportunity to find a good bargain is a primary motivation for participating in online auctions.

However, participating in an online auction often requires buyers to trust an inherently adverse environment. First, because sellers can register under pseudonyms, a buyer risks transacting with an unknown seller rather than a trustworthy retailer. Second, the large scale of online auction houses means many sellers advertise the same items, forcing buyers to choose from a large set of pseudonymous sellers. Recent studies have shown that pseudonymous sellers, large scale, and even the policies of the auction house encourage users to cheat. A legitimate bidder participating in an auction has no way to determine whether other bidders are honest or are shill bidders collaborating with the seller to artificially inflate the final price.

One tool to establish trust between buyers and sellers is an electronic reputation system. Typically, a reputation system is a bi-directional medium where buyers post feedback on sellers, and vice versa. In eBay, buyers voluntarily comment on the quality of service, satisfaction with the item traded, and promptness of shipping. Sellers comment on prompt payment from buyers or respond to comments left by buyers.

However, these feedback-based reputation systems suffer from two drawbacks. First, the reliability of the feedback is debatable: recent studies have shown that bi-directional reputation systems tend to inflate positive feedback and deflate negative feedback. Indeed, our analysis of eBay auctions shows that 95% of eBay sellers have good reputations and that 98% of their feedback is positive. Second, existing reputation systems do not help buyers avoid sellers whose auctions regularly appear price-inflated. The systems do not account for tactics, either legitimate or fraudulent, that a seller may use to ensure a profitable sale. A buyer cannot rationally choose a seller from the many that advertise a product.

We propose a reputation system that addresses these drawbacks. Our system identifies sellers whose auctions appear to be price-inflated. It does not determine the cause of price inflation, i.e., it does not determine whether the price inflation is due to legal competitive bidding or is fraudulent. In conjunction with a traditional feedback-based system, our system helps buyers avoid sellers who have good feedback but whose auctions are likely to end with prices near or above the items' market values. Our system is robust against biased feedback because it avoids voluntary feedback from users.

An example demonstrates the effectiveness of our system. Using data collected from actual eBay auctions, we automatically detected, out of more than 12,000 sellers, a hard-disk seller with the following behavior: all his auctions ended with a winning bid, while on average, 30% of the auctions posted by other hard-disk sellers ended with no bids. The average number of bids in this seller’s auctions was abnormally high. A group of bidders repeatedly participated and lost in his auctions, thus acting as shills. While our system cannot determine whether this behavior is fraudulent or merely competitive, the patterns discovered suggest that a buyer is unlikely to find a bargain in this seller’s auctions. Indeed, the final prices in his auctions were comparable to market value when coupled with shipping fees.

### Related Work
We review related work in reputation systems, fraud in electronic transactions, and anomaly detection.

#### Reputation Systems
A reputation system establishes trust in electronic transactions. Brinkmann and Seifert argued that participation in an online transaction requires a feedback mechanism to establish trust. This requirement arises from the fundamental difference between online and real-life environments: in online systems, participants have not met and do not have the mutual information needed for the risk assessment of the transaction. In an analysis of the eBay reputation system, Dellarocas concluded that positive and negative feedback can affect the price and the probability of a sale, and noted that the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, indicating that the present eBay feedback mechanism may not work. Resnick and Zeckhauser, and later, Resnick et al., uncovered similar limitations in the eBay system: feedback is not the best predictor of future behavior, and negative feedback has little impact.

Chen and Singh proposed a reputation system for raters (providers of feedback), based on the consistency of a rater over time. This approach might improve the current eBay reputation system but is still fundamentally restricted to answering questions about seller behavior after an auction, i.e., after bidding has completed, but before the item has been delivered. Thus, this system can answer questions about the quality of the item, promptness in shipping, and so on. Our reputation system is complementary in that it describes bidding behavior during an auction. Analogously to Chen and Singh’s system, our system automatically tracks both bidders' and sellers' auctioning behaviors.

#### Fraud in Electronic Transactions
Fraud is one cause of price inflation in an electronic transaction system. Fraud prevention attempts to build marketplaces that limit or eliminate fraud altogether, while fraud detection identifies fraud during or after a transaction. In online auctioning, fraud prevention is achieved using policies and regulation (e.g., eBay prohibits auction shilling) and feedback-based reputation systems are used to report past cases of fraud.

Where fraud prevention and detection were insufficient or impossible, researchers changed the transaction system to make fraudulent activities undesirable. Hidvégiet al. addressed the problem of shilling by proposing a Shill-Proof Fee (SPF) system that countered the monetary benefit of shilling through a dynamic fee based on the difference between the final price and the reserve price (the lowest price at which the seller is willing to sell). SPF is applicable only to Independent Private Value (IPV) auctions, where each potential bidder has his own valuation of the item for sale. In contrast, most eBay auctions are common value, where the item for sale has a common value (e.g., the market price of the item) known to every potential bidder. The proposed SPF scheme is not practical in the eBay setting as some fees would be excessive, reaching 60% or more of the final price.

Detecting fraud in online auctions is inherently different than detecting fraud in other Internet activities. In an auction, a participant might not know that fraud has occurred even after the auction has concluded. Kauffman and Wood used heuristics to determine when a bid is "questionable." Labeling bids as "questionable" or "honest" before applying learning to derive a fraud-detection algorithm limits the scope of detection to specific types of fraud. To avoid this limitation, we use unsupervised learning that does not require auctions to be labeled a priori. We identify sellers that are dissimilar from a norm we believe is not fraudulent. As a result, our system can detect price inflation regardless of its cause and provides the ability to compare the level in which a particular seller differs from all other sellers.

#### Anomaly Detection
Fraud detection can be cast as a classification problem: given a transaction such as a credit card purchase or a bid in an auction, determine if it is fraudulent. Designing a fraud detection tool, then, is the task of building or learning a classifier.

A classifier can be created using a database of past transactions where each data item is labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, known as supervised learning. Such methods have been applied for detecting fraud in electronic commerce: Brause et al. presented a neural network algorithm for detecting credit card fraud, while the ASPeCT project applied supervised neural network learning to fraud detection in mobile phone systems. For online auctions, Kauffman and Wood proposed the use of logistic regression to predict reserve-price shilling. In intrusion detection for computer security, Lee et al. showed the importance of data mining for training classifiers from labeled data and then using the trained classifiers to do anomaly detection.

As mentioned, in online auctions, we do not have data labeled as "bargains" or "shills." Therefore, we use unsupervised learning techniques to split the sellers into normal and abnormal sets. We then evaluate the relation between abnormal sellers and price inflation. To distinguish between normal and abnormal sellers, we use some of the features reported by Shah et al. They analyzed eBay auction data and applied clustering (a form of unsupervised learning) to classify bidders. They found several characteristics that applied to shills: shills are a group of bidders with a strong association to a seller, shills are infrequent winners, and shills bid early in the auction. In this work, we capture the first two features in our bidder profiles (Section 4).

In computer security, intrusion detection has benefited from unsupervised learning, as the labeling of data is cumbersome, error-prone, and time-consuming. Kruegel et al. proposed a system for service-specific anomaly detection, where an anomaly score was assigned to each network packet. Similarly, we build our technique on principles from anomaly detection, where we capture normal behavior and detect variations from the norm. This allows our technique to adapt and evolve over time, characteristics needed to track changes in both legitimate behavior and fraud patterns.

### Reputation via Anomaly Detection
Our work develops a reputation system that assigns low reputation to sellers whose auctions are anomalous. We formally characterize anomalous auctions using three statistical models, each of which provides different evidence for activity that artificially increases prices. We then apply anomaly detection techniques to these models and identify sellers with the strongest evidence for price inflation. We assign low reputation to such sellers.

In this section, we give an informal overview of the models we developed. We illustrate how the models automatically helped us identify a seller, called 102601, whose behavior corresponds to price inflation. We inspected 10260’s auctions and found evidence of bidder activity that appeared to artificially inflate this seller’s prices. A formal treatment of the models appears in Section 4.

#### Models of Bidding Behavior
Our reputation system is based on the concept of auctioning reputation, implemented using three statistical models:

- **N**: Average number of bids in a seller’s auctions. This model identifies sellers whose auctions, on average, attract a large number of bids compared to auctions posted by other sellers. Our analysis of eBay’s auction data shows that the number of bids in a seller’s auction is inversely correlated to the number of auctions a seller posts: more auctions imply fewer bids per auction. Thus, a seller is considered anomalous if they have many auctions and most of their auctions attract a large number of bids.

- **M**: The average minimum starting bid in a seller’s auctions. For each eBay auction, the seller can limit the first bid to a certain minimum, called the minimum starting bid. eBay will not let bidders place bids unless their bid is equal to or higher than this bid. M identifies sellers with the following property: they have a large number of bids in their auctions, but this behavior cannot be accounted for by a low minimum starting bid. We found that there is an inverse correlation between the minimum starting bid and the number of bids received per auction. An auction with a low minimum starting bid is likely to attract more bids than an auction with a high minimum starting bid. We use M to reduce our suspicion of price inflation in the auctions of a seller identified as anomalous by N.

- **P**: The bidders’ profiles in a seller’s auctions. This model determines, for each seller, whether there exists a group of bidders that repeatedly participates and loses in the seller’s auctions. The existence of such a group explains a high average number of bids as possible shilling activity.

We use each of the above models individually to split the sellers into normal and abnormal. A seller is abnormal with respect to N if their average number of bids is statistically different from that of other sellers. A seller is abnormal with respect to M if their average number of bids cannot be predicted with high confidence by M. A seller is abnormal with respect to P if their profile is statistically different from the profile of other sellers.

#### Using Anomaly Detection to Identify Price Inflation
Consider a seller called 10260 who published 345 auctions during the three weeks in which we collected auction data from eBay. According to our data, he is the ninth highest volume seller in the category Laptop Parts & Accessories. While the average number of bids across all sellers in this category is 1.75 with a standard deviation of 2.7, the average number of bids in 10260’s auctions is 9.75, which is significantly different from the average number of bids across all sellers. Furthermore, sellers with a similar number of auctions averaged less than one bid per auction. We conclude that 10260 is abnormal with respect to N.

We tried to explain 10260’s high average number of bids using the M model. 10260 usually set a minimum starting bid that was 67% lower than the market value of the item. M predicts, with 95% confidence, that with such a minimum-starting bid, the average number of bids should be 8.1. 10260’s low average minimum starting bid does not account for his high average number of bids. We conclude that 10260 is also abnormal with respect to M.

Next, we tried to explain 10260’s average number of bids using the P model. We found that out of 936 different bidders who participated in 10260’s auctions, 5 bidders participated in 65% of the auctions. However, these 5 bidders only won 1% of 10260’s auctions. If we define a bidder’s winning rate as the number of auctions won by the bidder divided by the number of auctions in which they participated, then these 5 bidders had a winning rate of only 0.008. This rate is 19 times lower than the average winning rate of all other bidders who bid on 10260’s auctions. We conclude that 10260 is abnormal with respect to P.

The bidding behavior of 10260’s auctions is abnormal according to all three of our models. While our system cannot prove that 10260 used shills, the 5 repeating bidders act consistently with the shill behavior reported by Shah et al. We believe that the anomalous behavior of 10260 suggests that a buyer is unlikely to find a bargain in 10260’s auctions.

10260 sells laptop computer hard-disks. In our three-week experiment, we found 258 other sellers who sell similar items. On average, 30% of these sellers’ auctions ended up with no bids; this is in stark contrast to 10260’s auctions, which always attracted bidders. There were no particular bargains that would have attracted a large number of bidders, further supporting the conclusion that 10260’s auctions are price-inflated.

### Summary
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
- A new application of anomaly detection. We formulate the problem of identifying unusual and possibly malicious selling practices in auctions as an anomaly detection problem.
- A new behavior-based reputation system. We introduce a reputation system based on sellers' and buyers' behavior rather than the feedback they give each other. We show that our system helps honest, bargain-seeking buyers identify auctions on which to place bids and avoid auctions that may be price-inflated.
- Real-world evaluation. We deploy our reputation system in a large-scale experiment on real auctioning data from eBay. We show how our reputation system effectively pinpoints the sellers whose auctions seem price-inflated. We also find that eBay’s reputation system assigns high reputation to sellers who seem to inflate prices, confirming our belief that eBay’s reputation system is not useful for finding bargains.
