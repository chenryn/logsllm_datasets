ABSTRACT
Existing reputation systems used by online auction houses do not
address the concern of a buyer shopping for commodities—ﬁnding
a good bargain. These systems do not provide information on the
practices adopted by sellers to ensure proﬁtable auctions. These
practices may be legitimate, like imposing a minimum starting bid
on an auction, or fraudulent, like using colluding bidders to inﬂate
the ﬁnal price in a practice known as shilling.
We develop a reputation system to help buyers identify sellers
whose auctions seem price-inﬂated. Our reputation system is based
upon models that characterize sellers according to statistical met-
rics related to price inﬂation. We combine the statistical models
with anomaly detection techniques to identify the set of suspicious
sellers. The output of our reputation system is a set of values for
each seller representing the conﬁdence with which the system can
say that the auctions of the seller are price-inﬂated.
We evaluate our reputation system on 604 high-volume sellers
who posted 37,525 auctions on eBay. Our system automatically
pinpoints sellers whose auctions contain potential shill bidders. When
we manually analyze these sellers’ auctions, we ﬁnd that many win-
ning bids are at about the items’ market values, thus undercutting a
buyer’s ability to ﬁnd a bargain and demonstrating the effectiveness
of our reputation system.

INTRODUCTION
Online auction houses such as eBay have emerged as a conve-
nient way to buy and sell items over the Internet. eBay alone has
over 147 million registered users who posted over 431 million new
listings in the ﬁrst quarter of 2005 [12]. The presence and inﬂu-
ence of such auction houses has been acknowledged by popular
traditional retailers who now use them to promote and sell their
products. Although online auctions sell commodities that are also
sold by traditional retailers, the opportunity to ﬁnd a good bargain
is a primary motivation to favor online auctioning.
However, participating in an online auction often requires buy-
ers to trust an inherently adverse environment. First, because sell-
ers can register under pseudonyms, a buyer risks participating in
a transaction with an unknown seller rather than a trustworthy re-
tailer. Second, because of the large scale of online auction houses,
many sellers advertise the same items and the buyer is forced to
choose from a large set of pseudonymous sellers. Recent studies
have shown that pseudonymous sellers, large scale, and even the
policies of the auction house encourage users to cheat [16]. A le-
gitimate bidder participating in an auction has no way to determine
whether other bidders in the auction are honest or are shill bid-
ders who collaborate with the seller to artiﬁcially inﬂate the ﬁnal
price [22, 27].
One tool to establish a trust between buyers and sellers is an
electronic reputation system [23]. Typically, a reputation system is
a bi-directional medium where buyers post feedback on sellers, and
vice versa. In eBay, buyers voluntarily comment on the quality of
service, their satisfaction with the item traded, and promptness of
shipping. Sellers comment about prompt payment from buyers, or
respond to comments left by buyers.
However, these feedback-based reputation systems suffer from
two drawbacks. First, the reliability of the feedback is debatable:
recent studies [7, 8, 24] have shown that bi-directional reputation
systems tend to inﬂate positive feedback and deﬂate negative feed-
back. Indeed, our own analysis of eBay auctions shows that 95% of
eBay sellers have good reputations and that 98% of their feedback
is positive. Second, existing reputation systems do not help buyers
avoid sellers whose auctions regularly appear price-inﬂated. The
systems do not account for tactics, either legitimate or fraudulent,
that a seller may use to ensure a proﬁtable sale. A buyer cannot
rationally choose a seller from the many that advertise a product.
We propose a reputation system that addresses these drawbacks.
Our system identiﬁes sellers whose auctions appear to be price-
inﬂated. It does not determine the cause of price inﬂation, i.e., it
does not determine whether the price inﬂation is legal competitive
bidding or is fraudulent. In conjunction with a traditional feedback-
based system, our system helps buyers avoid sellers who have good
feedback but whose auctions are likely to end with prices near or
above the items’ market values. Our system is robust against biased
feedback because it avoids voluntary feedback from users.
An example demonstrates the effectiveness of our system. Us-
ing data collected from actual eBay auctions, we automatically
detected, out of more than 12,000 sellers, a hard-disk seller with
the following behavior: all his auctions ended with a winning bid,
while on average, 30% of the auctions posted by other hard-disk
sellers ended with no bids. The average number of bids in this
seller’s auctions was abnormally high. A group of bidders repeat-
edly participated, and lost, in his auctions, thus acting as shills.
While our system cannot determine whether this behavior is fraud-
ulent or merely competitive, the patterns discovered suggest that a
buyer is unlikely to ﬁnd a bargain in this seller’s auctions. Indeed,
the ﬁnal prices in his auctions were comparable to market value
when coupled with shipping fees.
We build our system using principles of anomaly detection. Our
system is based upon the assumptions that most sellers are hon-
est and their auctions are not artiﬁcially price-inﬂated. We collect
data from the auctions of each seller, statistically compare each
seller’s data against the data of all other sellers, and identify anoma-
lous sellers. We designed our statistical models to identify price
inﬂation; consequently, anomalies indicate sellers likely to have
adopted questionable tactics and whose auctions are better avoided.
Our reputation system is based upon three statistical models. The
ﬁrst model correlates the number of auctions a seller posts to the
average number of bids in those auctions. We found an inverse
correlation—as the number of a seller’s auctions increases, the av-
erage bid count decreases. This model identiﬁes the ﬁrst set of
anomalous sellers: those who post many auctions and also attract
many bidders. We assume that the auctions of some of these sellers
are inﬂated.
The second model provides an explanation, in terms of legitimate
behavior, for the anomalous sellers identiﬁed by the ﬁrst model.
The model correlates an auction’s starting bid to the number of
bids in the auction. We found that auctions with low starting bids
receive more bids then auctions with higher starting bids. Hence,
this model separates the anomalous sellers of the ﬁrst model, sell-
ers whose auctions attracts abnormally high number of bids, into
two sets: those with low starting bids and those with high starting
bids. We accept a low starting bid as a legitimate explanation for
high number of bids. Therefore, auctions with many bids and low
starting bids are less likely to be price-inﬂated than auctions with
many bids and high starting bids.
The third model provides explanation for the anomalous cases
identiﬁed by the ﬁrst model in terms of fraudulent behavior. The
model identiﬁes a group of bidders who repeatedly participate in
a seller’s auctions, and lose. We call this group of bidders poten-
tial shills because their behavior is consistent with shilling: they
inﬂate prices and let other people win. We use the third model to
strengthen our belief that a seller’s prices are inﬂated.
These three models identify anomalous sellers who appear to
be artiﬁcially raising bids in their auctions. A seller with inﬂated
prices is a seller who: (i) according to the ﬁrst model, has many
auctions that attract many bids, (ii) according to the second model,
does not start auctions with a relatively low starting bid, and (iii)
according to the third model, has a group of bidders who repeat-
edly participate in his auctions and lose. In addition to classifying
a seller as normal or abnormal, our system also provides a score for
each seller. This score is a set of three values, one for each model,
that represents conﬁdence in the system’s classiﬁcation.
To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows:
• A new application of anomaly detection. We formulate the
problem of identifying unusual and possibly malicious selling
practices in auctions as an anomaly detection problem.
• A new behavior-based reputation system. We introduce a rep-
utation system that is based upon sellers’ and buyers’ behavior
rather than the feedback they give each other. We show that
our system helps honest, bargain-seeking buyers identify auc-
tions on which to place bids and avoid auctions which may be
price-inﬂated.
• Real-world evaluation. We deploy our reputation system in a
large-scale experiment on real auctioning data from eBay. We
show how our reputation system effectively pinpoints the sellers
whose auctions seem price-inﬂated. We also ﬁnd that eBay’s
reputation system assigns high reputation to sellers who seem to
inﬂate prices, thus conﬁrming our belief that eBay’s reputation
system is not useful for ﬁnding bargains.
2. RELATED WORK
We review related work in reputation systems, fraud in electronic
transactions, and anomaly detection.
2.1 Reputation systems
A reputation system establishes trust in electronic transactions.
Brinkmann and Seifert [4] argued that participation in an online
transaction requires a feedback mechanism to establish trust. This
requirement arises from the fundamental difference between online
and real-life environments: in online systems, the participants have
not met and do not have the mutual information needed for the risk
assessment of the transaction. In an analysis of the eBay reputation
system, Dellarocas [8] concluded that positive and negative feed-
back can affect the price and the probability of a sale, and noted
that the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, a possible indication
that the present eBay feedback mechanism does not work. Resnick
and Zeckhauser [24], and, later, Resnick et al. [25] uncovered simi-
lar limitations in the eBay system: feedback is not the best predictor
of future behavior, and negative feedback has little impact.
Attempting to address the shortcomings of the eBay feedback-
based reputation system, Chen and Singh [6] proposed a reputa-
tion system for raters (providers of feedback), based on the con-
sistency of a rater over time. This approach might improve the
current eBay reputation system, but is still fundamentally restricted
to answering questions about seller behavior after an auction, i.e.,
after bidding has completed, but before the item has been deliv-
ered. Thus, this system can answer questions about the quality of
the item, promptness in shipping, and so on. Our reputation system
is complementary in that it describes bidding behavior during an
auction. Analogously to Chen and Singh’s system, our system au-
tomatically tracks both bidders’ and sellers’ auctioning behaviors.
2.2 Fraud in electronic transactions
Fraud is one cause of price inﬂation in an electronic transaction
system. Fraud prevention attempts to build marketplaces that limit
or eliminate fraud altogether, while fraud detection identiﬁes fraud
during or after a transaction. In online auctioning, fraud prevention
is achieved using policies and regulation (e.g., eBay prohibits auc-
tion shilling [11]) and feedback-based reputation systems are used
to report past cases of fraud.
Where fraud prevention and detection were insufﬁcient or im-
possible, researchers changed the transaction system to make fraud-
ulent activities undesirable. Hidv´egi et al. [13] addressed the prob-
lem of shilling by proposing a Shill-Proof Fee (SPF) system that
countered the monetary beneﬁt of shilling through a dynamic fee
based on the difference between the ﬁnal price and the reserve price
(the lowest price at which the seller is willing to sell). SPF is ap-
plicable only to Independent Private Value (IPV) auctions, where
each potential bidder has his own valuation of the item for sale. In
contrast, most eBay auctions are common value, where the item for
sale has a common value (e.g., the market price of the item) known
to every potential bidder. The proposed SPF scheme is not practical
in the eBay setting as some fees would be excessive, reaching 60%
or more of the ﬁnal price.
Detecting fraud in online auctions is inherently different than de-
tecting fraud in other Internet activities. In an auction, a participant
might not know that fraud has occurred even after the auction has
concluded. Kauffman and Wood [16] used heuristics to determine
when a bid is “questionable.” Labeling bids as “questionable” or
“honest” before applying learning to derive a fraud-detection algo-
rithm limits the scope of detection to speciﬁc types of fraud. To
avoid this limitation, we use unsupervised learning that does not
require auctions to be labeled a priori. We identify sellers that are
dissimilar from a norm we believe is not fraudulent. As a result,
our system can detect price inﬂation regardless of its cause and
provides the ability to compare the level in which a particular seller
differs from all other sellers.
2.3 Anomaly detection
Fraud detection can be cast as a classiﬁcation problem: given a
transaction such as a credit card purchase or a bid in an auction,
determine if it is fraudulent. Designing a fraud detection tool, then,
is the task of building or learning a classiﬁer.
A classiﬁer can be created using a database of past transactions
where each data item is labeled as fraudulent or legitimate, known
as supervised learning (e.g., [10]). Such methods have been applied
for detecting fraud in electronic commerce: Brause et al. [3] pre-
sented a neural network algorithm for detection of credit card fraud,
while the ASPeCT project [21] applied supervised neural network
learning to fraud detection in mobile phone systems. For online
auctions, Kauffman and Wood [16] proposed the use of logistic
regression to predict reserve-price shilling. In intrusion detection
for computer security, Lee et al. [19, 20] showed the importance of
data mining for training classiﬁers from labeled data and then use
the trained classiﬁers to do anomaly detection.
As mentioned, in online auctions we do not have data labeled
as “bargains” or “shills”. Therefore, we use unsupervised learning
techniques to split the sellers into normal and abnormal sets. We
then evaluate the relation between abnormal sellers and price inﬂa-
tion. To distinguish between normal and abnormal sellers, we use
some of the features reported by Shah et al. [27]. They analyzed
eBay auction data and applied clustering (a form of unsupervised
learning) to classify bidders. They found several characteristics that
applied to shills: shills are a group of bidders with a strong associ-
ation to a seller, shills are infrequent winners, and shills bid early
in the auction. In this work, we capture the ﬁrst two features in our
bidder proﬁles (Section 4).
In computer security, intrusion detection beneﬁted from unsuper-
vised learning, as the labeling of data is cumbersome, error-prone,
and time consuming. Kruegel et al. [18] proposed a system for
service-speciﬁc anomaly detection, where an anomaly score was
assigned to each network packet. Similarly, we build our technique
on principles from anomaly detection, where we capture normal
behavior and detect variations from the norm. This allows our tech-
nique to adapt and evolve over time, characteristics needed to track
the changes both in legitimate behavior and in fraud patterns [2].
3. REPUTATION VIA ANOMALY
DETECTION
Our work develops a reputation system that assigns low reputa-
tion to sellers whose auctions are anomalous. We formally char-
acterize anomalous auctions using three statistical models, each of
which provides different evidence for activity that artiﬁcially in-
creases prices. We then apply anomaly detection techniques to
these models and identify sellers with the strongest evidence for
price inﬂation. We assign low reputation to such sellers.
In this section, we give an informal overview of the models we
developed. We illustrate how the models automatically helped us
identify a seller, called 102601, whose behavior corresponds to
price inﬂation. We inspected 10260’s auctions and found evidence
of bidder activity that appeared to artiﬁcially inﬂate this seller’s
prices. A formal treatment of the models appears in Section 4.
3.1 Models of Bidding Behavior
Our reputation system is based upon the concept of auctioning
reputation, which we implement using three statistical models.
N : Average number of bids in a seller’s auctions. This model
identiﬁes sellers whose auctions, on average, attract a large
number of bids as compared to auctions posted by other sell-
ers. Our analysis of eBay’s auction data shows that the number
of bids in a seller’s auction is inversely correlated to the num-
ber of auctions a seller posts: more auctions imply fewer bids
per auction. Thus, a seller is considered anomalous if he has
many auctions and most of his auctions attract a large number
of bids.
Note that the N model does not provide an explanation for
price inﬂation. In particular, price inﬂation may be because of
ﬁerce bidder competition, which is legitimate, or because of
shilling, which is fraudulent.
The next two models provide explanations for the anomalous
cases identiﬁed by the ﬁrst model.
M: The average minimum starting bid in a seller’s auctions.
For each eBay auction, the seller can limit the ﬁrst bid to a
certain minimum, called the minimum starting bid. eBay will
not let bidders place bids unless their bid is equal to or higher
than this bid.
M identiﬁes sellers with the following property: they have
a large number of bids in their auctions, but this behavior can-
not be accounted for by a low minimum starting bid. We found
that there is an inverse correlation between the minimum start-
ing bid and the number of bids received per auction. An auc-
tion with a low minimum starting bid is likely to attract more
bids than an auction with a high minimum starting bid. We use
M to reduce our suspicion of price inﬂation in the auctions of
a seller identiﬁed as anomalous by N .
P: The bidders’ proﬁles in a seller’s auctions. This model deter-
mines, for each seller, whether there exists a group of bidders
that repeatedly participates, and loses, in the seller’s auctions.
The existence of such a group explains a high average number
of bids as possible shilling activity.
We use each of the above models individually to split the sellers
into normal and abnormal. We say that a seller is abnormal with
respect to N if the seller’s average number of bids is statistically
different than that of other sellers. We say that a seller is abnormal

with respect to M if the seller’s average number of bids cannot
be predicted with high conﬁdence by M. We say that a seller is
abnormal with respect to P if his proﬁle is statistically different
than the proﬁle of other sellers.
3.2 Using Anomaly Detection to Identify Price
Inﬂation
Consider a seller called 10260 who published 345 auctions dur-
ing the three weeks in which we collected auction data from eBay.
According to our data, he is the ninth highest volume seller in the
category Laptop Parts & Accessories. While the average number
of bids across all sellers in this category is 1.75 with a standard
deviation of 2.7, the average number of bids in 10260’s auctions
is 9.75, which is signiﬁcantly different than the average number of
bids across all sellers. Furthermore, sellers with a similar number
of auctions averaged less than one bid per auction. We conclude
that 10260 is abnormal with respect to N .
We tried to explain 10260’s high average number of bids using
the M model. 10260 usually set a minimum starting bid that was
67% lower than the market value of the item. M predicts, with
95% conﬁdence, that with such a minimum-starting bid, the aver-
age number of bids should be 8.1. 10260’s low average minimum
starting bid does not account for his high average number of bids.
We conclude that 10260 is also abnormal with respect to M.
Next, we tried to explain 10260’s average number of bids us-
ing the P model. We found that out of 936 different bidders who
participated in 10260’s auctions, 5 bidders participated in 65% of
the auctions. However, these 5 bidders only won 1% of 10260’s
auctions.
If we deﬁne a bidder’s winning rate as the number of
auctions won by the bidder divided by the number of auctions in
which they participated, then these 5 bidders had a winning rate of
only 0.008. This rate is 19 times lower than the average winning
rate of all other bidders who bid on 10260’s auctions. We conclude
that 10260 is abnormal with respect to P.
The bidding behavior of 10260’s auctions is abnormal according
to all three of our models. While our system cannot prove that
10260 used shills, the 5 repeating bidders act consistently with the
shill behavior reported by Shah et al. [27]. We believe that the
anomalous behavior of 10260 suggests that a buyer is unlikely to
ﬁnd a bargain in 10260’s auctions.
10260 sells laptop computer hard-disks. In our three-week ex-
periment, we found 258 other sellers who sell similar items. On
average, 30% of these sellers’ auctions ended up with no bids; this
is in stark contrast to 10260’s auctions, which always attracted bid-
ders. There were no particular bargains that would have attracted a
