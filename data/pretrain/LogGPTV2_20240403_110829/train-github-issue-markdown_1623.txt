There is a lot of information in the stats API, but little of it is
documented, and confusion arises...
e.g.  
_all.primaries.docs.count shows all the documents lucene sees, which may be
different to the documents elasticsearch sees with a simple search if there
are nested documents being used. (I think this statement is true... but is
it?)
