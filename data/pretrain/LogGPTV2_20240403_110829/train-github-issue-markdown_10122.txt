Hi,
I'm pretty new at working with bootstrap, just switched to it so sorry if this
is a dumb question:
I have a button that triggers a modal dialog and I want to make that button
also call a different function when it's clicked, so I decided to go with the
following code:
$(function () {  
$("#mycontainer").on('click.product-row.deleteproductbtn', function ( e ) {  
alert('button clicked!');  
})  
});
Since the above code displays 3 alerts every time I click the button, I went
with the following:
$(function () {  
$(""#mycontainer").off('click').on('click.product-row.deleteproductbtn',
function ( e ) {  
var $e = $(e.target);  
e.preventDefault();  
alert('button clicked!');  
})  
});
The second bit of code gets the job done, but I keep wondering if I'm damaging
the rest of the events that come with bootstrap... How would you associate a
button click (already activated through bootstrap) with a custom-made function
?
