User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to prove a picture was taken before a certain date? I need to prove that all my pictures were taken before a certain date.  Is uploading them to Picassa, Flickr or a similar service a good way to achieve such timestamping?

Assistant: In general, the problem of Secure Timestamping is actually a complex topic with no single right answer. There are two general approaches: 1) a trusted "Timestamping Authority" keeps logs of when stuff happened and everybody believes them because that's literally their job. 2) Using cryptography in some way. In general the crypto approaches don't work very well and can only prove that photo A was logged before photo B, but not the exact time.

There are lots of companies on the market who offer timestamping services based on one of these two approaches. How much you want to trust them depends on how transparent the company is with their practices, and what local law apply.

So, for your situation: it sounds like somebody is requiring you to do this (maybe for legal reasons?). You should find out level of trust they need in the timstamping authority. What you have come up with is to use Picassa or Flickr as a trusted Timestamping Authority. Depending on what you need the timestamp for, that might be ok. For example, if it's your friend to win a bet, then the upload time on Picassa or Flickr is probably fine. If this is to prove ownership of multi-billion dollar real estate holdings, then you may want to involve a notary.

Basically, ask yourself this question: is the dollar value that you stand to gain or lose greater than what it would cost to hack or bribe Picassa into changing a timestamp? If no then you're fine. If yes, then you need a more official timestamping service.
