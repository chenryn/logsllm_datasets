User: Maybe I am missing something, but I just downloaded pypy 2.0 beta2 windows binary (32 bit), and it seems I can run the interpreter by executing pypy.exe. However, I would like pypy to work with pyscripter and for all my old libraries to be available. Is this possible? Or is it as if I just installed a new version of python (so I would need to install all of my libraries again)? I might be confused at a fundamental level.
Thanks!
Assistant: PyCharm Community edition IDE by JetBrains supports pypy, or any other interpreter
Just go to File > Settings > Project INterpreter and set interpreter location
