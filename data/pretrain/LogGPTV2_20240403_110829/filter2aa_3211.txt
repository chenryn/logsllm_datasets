The future is present, here and now. But to see it, you must fly. Richard Thieme
leads you to the edge of a cliff... and gives you a push.
New ways of thinking emerge during free fall. Identities diverge, shapes
change, and questions linger long after you put down this astonishing book.
Mind Games provides wings.  Risk the trip. You’ll never be merely human again.
