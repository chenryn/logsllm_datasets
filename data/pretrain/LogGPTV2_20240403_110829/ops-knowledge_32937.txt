Question: In an effort to enhance detection capabilities for process injection techniques, a cybersecurity team is configuring their monitoring systems. Which of the following detection methods would provide the most effective way to identify unauthorized process injections?
"A": "Monitoring for file metadata changes indiscriminately across the network to detect potential code injections.",
"B": "Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call, which should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature.",
"C": "Relying solely on behavior-based detection for process injections without analyzing the specific sequences of API calls.",
"D": "Monitoring for process memory inconsistencies by comparing memory ranges against a known copy of the legitimate module."
