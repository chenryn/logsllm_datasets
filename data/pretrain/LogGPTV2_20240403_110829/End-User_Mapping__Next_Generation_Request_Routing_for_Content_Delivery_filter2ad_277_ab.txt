### Motivation for End-User Mapping

To understand the need for end-user mapping, we begin by analyzing the geographical distribution of clients relative to their recursive name servers (LDNS) in the global Internet. To achieve an accurate representation, we must match a large and representative set of clients worldwide with their respective LDNS. This matching process allows us to use our geo-location database [1] to determine the geographic and network information necessary for the analysis.

### 3.1 Collecting Client-LDNS Pairs

Associating a client with its LDNS presents several inherent challenges. Both the LDNS's request for domain name resolution and the client's subsequent request for a URL on that domain are logged at Akamai’s authoritative name servers and content servers, respectively. One potential approach is to match these requests to obtain client-LDNS pairings. However, this method is imprecise because the two requests can be spaced within a time window equal to the TTL of the domain name. Additionally, if the client receives a cached response from its LDNS, the LDNS does not make a corresponding downstream request to Akamai’s authoritative name servers. While there are heuristic methods to obtain a smaller sample of client-LDNS pairs [24], our challenge is to gather a large, representative, and definitive set of pairs that cover a broad spectrum of clients generating traffic on the global Internet.

To address this, we leverage Akamai’s download manager, NetSession [3]. NetSession is installed on client devices to facilitate faster and more reliable downloads. Software and media publishers opt-in to use NetSession features to enhance HTTP delivery performance for their content. Once they opt-in, clients use NetSession to download the content. Consequently, NetSession has a large, representative installed base of clients worldwide, making it an ideal platform for our analysis. Over 30 million unique NetSession clients perform transactions every month.

NetSession was instrumented to collect LDNS information as follows:
- Each NetSession client maintains a persistent connection with a NetSession control plane, allowing it to reliably learn its external client IP even if behind a NAT.
- Clients also discover their LDNS server by performing a "dig" command on a special Akamai name, whoami.akamai.net.
- The client-LDNS association data is then sent to Akamai’s cloud storage for processing.
- The LDNS information for clients around the world is aggregated in the cloud to the granularity of /24 client IP blocks. For each /24 client IP block, the process generates a set of IPs corresponding to the LDNSes used by the clients in that address block. The relative frequency of each LDNS is also computed.

Using this process, we collected LDNS data from March 24 to April 7, 2014. On average, about 14.8 million records were processed per day during our data collection period. We computed client-LDNS association data for a total of 3.76 million /24 client IP blocks. Although the clients using NetSession are a fraction of the total active clients in any given /24 client IP block, our coverage is representative and significant. Specifically, the /24 client IP blocks in our dataset account for about 84.6% of the total global client demand served by Akamai. Our dataset includes just over 584,000 distinct LDNSes, providing a large, representative cross-section of clients and LDNSes in the global Internet.

### 3.2 Estimating Client-LDNS Distances

To estimate the distances between clients and their LDNS, we use Akamai’s Edgescape [1] geo-location database. This database uses registry and network data distilled from transactions handled by over 170,000 Akamai servers in 102 countries and over a thousand ISP deployments worldwide to establish geographical and network information for IPs. Edgescape provides the latitude, longitude, country, and autonomous system (AS) for an IP. For IPs in mobile networks, the mobile gateway location is used as the reference location. The distance between a client-LDNS pair is calculated using the great circle distance based on their latitude and longitude coordinates.

### 3.3 Analysis of Client-LDNS Distances

**Global Distribution:**
Figure 5 shows the overall global distribution of client-LDNS distances. Nearly half of the client population is located very close to their LDNS, with the most typical distance being no greater than the diameter of a metropolitan area. There is a notable increase in the marginal distribution at around 200-300 miles, and another at around 5000 miles, which can be attributed to clients using LDNS across the Atlantic or Pacific oceans.

**Country Breakdown:**
Figure 6 provides a box-plot representing the 5th, 25th, median, 75th, and 95th quantiles of the per-country distributions for the top 25 countries by aggregate client demand. Most countries have a small median distance, but India, Turkey, Vietnam, and Mexico have median distances over 1000 miles. India, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina have significant populations whose LDNSes are very far away, with over a quarter of the population served by LDNSes over 4500 miles away. Western Europe sees low distances, while Korea and Taiwan have the smallest distances, reflecting their well-developed Internet infrastructure and concentrated urban populations.

**Public Resolvers:**
Figure 7 shows the client-LDNS distance for clients using public resolvers like Google Public DNS or OpenDNS. These providers use distributed name server infrastructure and IP anycast to route clients to the "closest" LDNS deployment. However, the public resolvers use unicast addresses when communicating with Akamai’s authoritative name servers, allowing us to geo-locate them. The median distance for clients using public resolvers is 1028 miles, compared to 162 miles for the overall client population, indicating that public DNS provider deployments may often not be local to the client.

**Country-Specific Public Resolver Usage:**
Figure 8 highlights disproportionately large distances for clients using public resolvers in some South American, Southeast Asian, and Oceania countries. Argentina and Brazil have the largest distances, likely due to the limited presence of major public resolver providers in these regions. In contrast, clients in Western Europe, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are relatively close to their LDNS, though still more distant than those not using public resolvers.

**Adoption of Public Resolvers:**
Figure 9 shows the percentage of client demand originating from public resolvers, broken down by country. Clients in Vietnam and Turkey are heavy users of public resolvers. Despite significant client-LDNS distances, a significant fraction of clients in India, Brazil, and Argentina also use public resolvers. Overall, the percentage of client demand from public resolvers approaches 8% worldwide.

**Breakdown by Autonomous System (AS):**
Figure 10 shows the distribution of client-LDNS distances as a function of AS size, where AS size is the client demand originating from that AS as a percentage of the total client demand served by Akamai. When the AS size is small, the client-LDNS distances are larger, especially for the higher percentiles.
