Prevention and Detection !?
What is NoSQL？
χ No SQL (statement)
χ No SQL Injection
 Not only a SQL
 Non-RDBMS
• Semi-structured
• Schema-less
Types of NoSQL
1.
Key-value based
2.
Column-based
3.
Document-based
4.
Graph-based
5.
Object-based
6.
…
Why NoSQL
1.
Performance
2.
Scalability
Who use NoSQL concept?
1.
Cloud Computing 
 (SaaS Security)
2.
SNS
3.
Portal Website
Mixed Databases
NoSQL Architecture
1.
Web Application & Web Service
2.
Client Library
 The key factor
 Query-method
3.
NoSQL Database
NoSQL Vulnerabilities
1.
Connection Pollution
2.
JSON Injection
3.
View Injection
4.
Key Bruteforce
NoSQL Vulnerabilities
1.
Connection Pollution
 RESTful
 Cross-Database/-Pool Access
 CouchDB’s Global and DB Handler
Ex:
 NoSQL.connect(“http://”.$Pool.”/HIT2010/”)
 NoSQL.connect(“http://POOL/”.$Database)
Document-based Problem
(CouchDB)
2.
JSON Injection（Data）
 DRY（Don’t Repeat Yourself）
 The weakness is String type
•
Using Collection type
 escapeJSON()/unescapeJSON()
•
When handling tainted strings
Document-based Problem
(CouchDB)
3.
View Injection（Application）
 CouchDB's view is using SpiderMonkey as Scripting Engine
 What is “View”? CouchApp 
 Predefined View and Temporary View
 Evil Map/Reduce
Key-Value based Problem
4.
Key Bruteforce
 Schema-free 
 How to make faster attacks?
 Depends on implementation of client library & architecture
 CHALLENGE：Can I make context-sensitive attack?
http://IP/app/action?key=1aD33rSq
Ex:
 $value = NoSQL.Get($key)
Key-Value based Problem
4.
Key Bruteforce Prevention (Application-level)
 Key Size
 Key Space
 Unpredictable Key Generation
 Challenge-based
NoSQL vs. WAS
1.
Unknown Error Message
 Logic-based Blind Injection when XQL is exist
 Time-based Differential Attack?
2.
Different Types of Attack Payload
1. Languages
2. Schema-less
 Redefine Attack Surface 
(Entry Point Sensitive than RDBMS)
3.
Different Concepts of Attack
NoSQL vs. SCA
1.
Checking by Data Flow，but Diversity
 Unsupported Client Library
NoSQL vs. WAF
1.
Key Bruteforce is not Injection Attack
 Block by Access Threshold
2.
URL Integrity Check (ex: Add Token)
 Transparency
Ex:
http://IP/app/action?key=1aD33rSq[HMAC($key)]
http://IP/app/action?key=1aD33rSq&OTPtoken=sdfg23s0
