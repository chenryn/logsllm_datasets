User: What is virtualization technology? How can virtualization be used to improve server resource utilization?
Assistant: Virtualization technology refers to the use of virtualization software to divide a physical server into multiple virtual servers, so that different applications can run independently without affecting each other. Through virtualization technology, you can maximize server resource utilization, reduce costs and increase flexibility. The main methods of using virtualization technology to improve the utilization of server resources include: 1. Multiple virtual machines share the hardware resources of a physical server, such as CPU, memory, disk space, etc., so that the processing power and storage. 2. Through virtualization technology, multiple applications on a physical server can be isolated to ensure that the mutual influence between them is minimal. 3. Through virtualization technology, multiple virtual machines can be quickly deployed and managed, server management can be simplified, and resources can be redistributed and expanded more quickly to meet the needs of different businesses. 4. Through virtualization technology, it is possible to run multiple virtual machines with different operating systems on a physical server, thereby saving the cost of server hardware configuration and simplifying the complex work of system maintenance and upgrading. 5. Virtualization technology can also improve the reliability of the server. By deploying multiple virtual machines on different physical servers, high availability and failover can be achieved, thereby maximizing business continuity.
