4. USAGE PATTERNS OF SMARTPHONE
APPS
In this section, we investigate how, where, and when smartphone
apps are used from spatial, temporal, and user perspectives. We
ﬁrst choose appropriate metrics to evaluate smartphone apps, and
then attempt to understand the impact of location, time, user, and
app interest accordingly.
4.1 Characterizing Usage with Different Met-
rics
We begin our analysis by presenting some broad characteristics
of smartphone app usage. For our analysis, we choose a number of
different natural metrics that proﬁle network activity. We use the
following three metrics for each app through most of our analysis:
(a) trafﬁc volume, deﬁned as the number of bytes consumed by
all subscribers using the app; (b) number of subscribers, deﬁned
as the number of unique subscribers using this app throughout our
week-long data set; (c) network access time, deﬁned as the total
duration summed across all the IP ﬂows generated by the app over
our week-long data set.
Figure 2 shows CDFs of these metrics for the apps. For each met-
ric, we aggregate together all the users of a particular app. The long
tail of these CDFs directly shows the huge diversity in smartphone
apps and their network characteristics. The top app in Figure 2(a)
is a “personalized Internet radio app”, and is responsible for more
than 3TB data in one week, while the majority of smartphone apps
generate only 1 – 10 MB over the same time period. Note that this
top app is by itself responsible for generating over 50% of the total
trafﬁc volume in the smartphone apps category. This dramatic vari-
ation in the trafﬁc volume is due to many factors, e.g., app genres,
popularity of apps, device types, preferences of the user base, con-
tent of apps, etc. For example, both news apps and radio apps may
provide users with the latest news, but news apps typically deliver
most of their content via text while radio apps deliver content via
streaming audio; thus, users of these two apps would receive news
on their smartphones with a substantial difference in the volume of
trafﬁc generated.
We observe a similar variation in Figure 2(b). The top app here
is a “social utility connecting people”, with a total network access
time exceeding 100 years (aggregated across all its users). This
app alone contributes to 86% of the total network access time of
the smartphone apps category, but the majority of the smartphone
apps are seen accessing the network for only about 1 minute - 1
hour. This “social utility” app also has the largest number of unique
subscribers, 540,230 according to Figure 2(c). The total number of
unique subscribers in our data set is 633,892 by examining the num-
ber of unique subscribers with DNS requests in Figure 1. Thus, we
may estimate that 6 in every 7 subscribers use this “social utility”
app on their smartphones. Recall that this data set contains only a
random sample of subscribers, so the numbers here do not reﬂect
the total number of subscribers in the cellular network. Around
60% smartphone apps have no more than 10 unique users in our
data set, thus illustrating the long tail of smartphone apps on the
market. Because of this long tail, we ﬁlter out the smaller apps for
some of our analysis as they do not have enough measurements.
We discuss this further in §4.2.
(cid:2)lg N(cid:3)
Figure 2(d) shows the correlation between the trafﬁc volume and
the number of unique subscribers, and between the access time and
the number of unique subscribers. We aggregate the apps with the
same 10
(N is the number of unique subscribers) and present
the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maxi-
mum in each aggregation point accordingly. Both the trafﬁc vol-
ume and the network access time roughly increase linearly with the
number of unique subscribers, but the high variation still exists in
the correlation. Due to the high variation, it is difﬁcult to estimate
the an app’s trafﬁc volume and network access time based only on
its number of users. However, given a certain large number of apps
together, their trafﬁc volume and access time may be predictable.
Accordingly, cellular providers may be able to estimate the radio
resource consumption and allocate radio resources.
Figure 3 shows the CDFs of the apps’ trafﬁc volume and access
time, now normalized by the number of subscribers that use the
app. We see a similar variation across apps in these CDFs as well.
For example, in Figure 3(a), the app with the largest trafﬁc vol-
ume per subscriber consumes 5GB in one week, but the majority
of apps consume less than 1MB data per subscriber in the week.
Likewise, in Figure 3(b), the app with the longest access time per
subscriber lasts for 2 days in one week, while the majority of apps
access the network for only 10 seconds - 1 hour per subscriber in
the week. From Figure 2 and Figure 3, we also observe apps with
very marginal usage in the long tail, e.g., the app consuming only
less than 1KB, the app accessing the network less than 10 sec, and
the app with only one user. These numbers indicate why we need
to ﬁlter out these tiny apps for our analysis.
4.2 Popular Smartphone Apps
Figure 2 shows that there are a substantial number of smartphone
apps with only 1 subscriber and that 60% of the smartphone apps
have no more than 10 unique subscribers. Thus, these apps do not
provide enough data for analysis, and, in this section, we explore
how to decide systematically which apps can be considered popular
and how we can eliminate the effect of apps with marginal usage
on our analysis.
In effect, we want to identify the popular smartphone apps based
on the numbers of their unique subscribers, but at the same time,

Figure 4: is the number of unique subscribers a good metric
for ﬁltering? Contributions of the top X apps to total volume
and access time respectively
we do not want to discriminate against apps with few subscribers
that have a signiﬁcant impact on the network, i.e., generate a lot
of trafﬁc or access the network for long time periods. So, we have
two questions to answer: (1) is the number of unique subscribers a
good metric for ﬁltering? (2) if so, what is a reasonable threshold
on the number of unique subscribers?
Intuitively, if the number of unique subscribers is a good metric
for ﬁltering, the top X apps based on the number of unique sub-
scribers should contribute similar amounts of trafﬁc volume and
access times as the top X apps based on the trafﬁc volume or access
time. We ﬁrst compare the contribution of the top X apps based on
different metrics. Figure 4 compares the contribution of the top X
apps based on the number of unique subscribers against the top X
apps based on the trafﬁc volume and based on the network access
time. We can observe that the cumulative contributions of the top X
apps based on access time and the top X apps based on number of
unique subscribers are quite close, by comparing the “access time”
and the “access time by top subs”. Likewise, the contributions of
the top X apps based on trafﬁc volume and number of unique sub-
scribers are also close, although a little difference does exist. We
note that over 90% of the total volume and access time is accounted
for by the top 1000 apps based on the number of unique subscribers.
Thus, Figure 4 indicates that somewhere above 1000 would be a
reasonable boundary to distinguish popular apps from apps in the
tail given the 90% coverage. We further explore the marginal nature
of the apps ranking above 1000 in Figure 5. Figure 5(a) shows
that each app in top 1000 have more than 471 unique subscribers.
Figure 5(b) shows the network access time and the trafﬁc volume
per user for apps ranking in 1000 – 4000. For both trafﬁc volume
and access time, we aggregate every 100 apps into one errorbar that
shows the minimum, median, and maximum of every 100 apps.
The app accessing network the most consumes only 250 seconds
per user in a week, and the app transferring the most data generates
only 500 KB per user in a week. Because of these small trafﬁc
volumes and short access times, we do not consider these apps to
be sufﬁciently active for our analysis.
Our discussion suggests that a natural threshold would be the
top 1000 apps ranked by the number of unique subscribers. Table 2
shows the number of apps in each genre, both for the top 1000 apps
as well as all the 22K apps. In the remainder of the paper, we will
refer to these top 1000 apps as popular apps.
4.3 Spatial Patterns: Distribution of the Geo-
graphic Usage of Smartphone Apps
Next, we investigate the diversity of smartphone apps being used
by subscribers in different geographic locations. Understanding the
spatial usage patterns of smartphone apps suggests ways to improve
user experience and performance from many aspects, such as con-
