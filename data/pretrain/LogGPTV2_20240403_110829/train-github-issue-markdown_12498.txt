When you maximize a window and then try to drag it down from the border (or in
my case a header div with `-webkit-app-region: drag;` style), the window will
unmaximize, but instead of getting the `unmaximize` event you'll just get the
`resize` event.  
If you do the same using the restore button (either through the border or
using the taskbar menu item), you will get the `unmaximize` event and then the
`resize` event, like you get with the rest of the size-change events.
This was tested on Windows 8.1 (64 bit) using Electron v0.30.2.
