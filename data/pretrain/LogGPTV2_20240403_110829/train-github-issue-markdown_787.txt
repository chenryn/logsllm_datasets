   TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str
   ```

**Summary:**
All hosts have failed, and the task has been aborted due to the `TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str`. This error suggests that the `parsed_new_key` variable is being treated as a list, but it is being accessed with a string index, which is incorrect.

To resolve this issue, you should review the `enforce_state` function and ensure that `parsed_new_key` is being handled correctly. Specifically, check if `parsed_new_key` is a list and if the index used to access it is an integer.
