I have a pipeline object with two steps, StandardScaler() and ElasticNet().
When I try to access the feature_names_in_ attribute of the trained
ElasticNet(), I am getting an error.
This is how I'm fitting the pipeline (no errors)
    pipe = Pipeline([
            ('scale', StandardScaler()),
            ('estimator', ElasticNet())])
    pipe.fit(X, y)
This is how I'm trying to access the attributes.
    model_coef = pipe.named_steps['estimator'].coef_
    model_feature_names = pipe.named_steps['estimator'].feature_names_in_
This is the error message.

          1 model_coef = pipe.named_steps['estimator'].coef_
    ----> 2 model_feature_names = pipe.named_steps['estimator'].feature_names_in_
    AttributeError: 'ElasticNet' object has no attribute 'feature_names_in_'
As you can see, accessing the coef_ attribute works just fine.
