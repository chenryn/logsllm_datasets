I'm experiencing an issue with a package on my Windows 8.1 system. When I click the "Disable" button and then the "Uninstall" button for the package, it seems to be removed because it no longer appears in the list of installed packages in the settings. However, when I try to reinstall the package by searching for it again, the "Uninstall" and "Enable" buttons are still present, and there is no "Install" button available. Additionally, nothing happens when I click either the "Uninstall" or "Enable" buttons.

Thank you for your help, and I apologize for any language errors in my message.
