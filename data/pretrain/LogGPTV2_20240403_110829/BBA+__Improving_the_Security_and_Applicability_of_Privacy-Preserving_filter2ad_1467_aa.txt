## Abstract

Black-box accumulation (BBA) has recently been introduced as a building block for various user-centric protocols, such as loyalty, refund, and incentive systems. In essence, BBA can be viewed as a cryptographic "piggy bank" that allows users to collect points (e.g., incentives, coins) in an anonymous and unlinkable manner. A piggy bank can be "robbed" by the user, allowing them to spend the collected points, revealing only the total amount and a unique serial number.

In this paper, we present BBA+, an enhanced definitional framework that extends the BBA model in several ways:
1. **Offline Support**: We support offline systems, eliminating the need for a permanent connection to a serial number database to check if a piggy bank has already been robbed.
2. **Negative Points**: We enforce the collection of "negative points," which users cannot voluntarily collect, as required in pre-payment or reputation systems.
3. **Stronger Security**: The security property formalized for BBA+ schemes is more robust and natural. It ensures that the claimed amount inside a piggy bank must match the legitimately collected amount, while maintaining unlinkability.
4. **Enhanced Privacy**: We define a stronger form of privacy, including forward and backward privacy, ensuring that transactions remain unlinkable even after a user's secrets are compromised.

We also present a construction of a BBA+ system using cryptographic building blocks and provide the results of a smartphone-based prototypical implementation. Our current instantiation is practical, allowing transactions to be completed within a second, with potential for further optimization.

## 1. Introduction

In numerous user-centric cyber-physical systems, point collection and redemption mechanisms are core components. Examples include loyalty programs like the German Payback system and the UK-based Nectar program, where users collect points for purchases and redeem them for vouchers, services, or other benefits.

Other applications, such as mobile sensing scenarios and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) systems, also use similar mechanisms to incentivize user behavior. In these systems, users collect environmental or health data and receive micro-payments in exchange, or e-car owners are rewarded for providing power to the Smart Grid.

In [25], Jager and Rupp formalized the core functional, security, and privacy requirements of a building block called black-box accumulation (BBA). BBA consists of non-interactive algorithms for generating, manipulating, and verifying properties of a BBA token (or piggy bank). When correctly executed, it allows users to collect positive points anonymously and unlinkably. However, BBA has several limitations, including weak security guarantees, the need for a permanent database connection, lack of mechanisms for negative points, and linkability of token creation and redemption.

These limitations restrict the applicability of BBA in user-centric systems. For instance, loyalty system providers do not want customers to pool or trade points, and partial redemptions should be possible without linking all transactions. Additionally, applications like anonymous reputation systems and pre- or post-payment systems require stronger security, offline capabilities, and the ability to handle negative points.

### 1.1 Our Contribution

#### Definitional Framework
We introduce the BBA+ framework, which addresses the limitations of BBA and significantly enhances its security and applicability. Our framework includes:
- **Interactive Algorithms**: More intuitive definitions and broader instantiations.
- **Negative Points**: Enforcement of the collection of negative points.
- **Token Freshness**: Mechanisms to identify old tokens and prevent double-spending.
- **Stronger Security**: A game-based security model that ensures the claimed balance matches the legitimately collected amount.
- **Privacy Model**: Simulation-based privacy, including forward and backward privacy, ensuring that transactions remain unlinkable even after a user's secrets are compromised.

#### Construction
We propose a semi-generic construction using public-key encryption, homomorphic trapdoor commitments, digital signatures, and Groth-Sahai (GS) non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs over bilinear groups. This construction ensures token freshness and supports the addition of positive or negative points in an unlinkable manner.

#### Implementation
We implemented our BBA+ instantiation and measured execution times on a smartphone. Our results show that all protocols can be executed in less than 400 ms, indicating that our current instantiation is practical and efficient, with potential for further optimization.
