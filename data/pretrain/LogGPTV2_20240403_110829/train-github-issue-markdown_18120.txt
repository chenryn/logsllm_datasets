**Current behavior**  
When setting the input type via a property the resulting value of a
FormControl/FormGroup after input change is not correct
e.g.
    inputType = 'number';
    formControl = new FormControl(789);
After updating the value in the input field the value of the formControl is a
string and NOT a number.  
When setting via type="number" the value is correct (a number).
**Expected behavior**  
To get the value of the form control in the correct type
