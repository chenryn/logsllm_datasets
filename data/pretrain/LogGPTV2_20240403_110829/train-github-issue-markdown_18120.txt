**Current Behavior**
When setting the input type via a property, the resulting value of a `FormControl` or `FormGroup` after an input change is not correct. For example:

```typescript
inputType = 'number';
formControl = new FormControl(789);
```

After updating the value in the input field, the value of the `formControl` is a string and **not** a number. When setting the input type via `type="number"`, the value is correctly a number.

**Expected Behavior**
The value of the form control should be in the correct type (e.g., a number when the input type is set to 'number').
