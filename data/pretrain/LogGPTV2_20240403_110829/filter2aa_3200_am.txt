• FY 2004: $989,000 by the Virginia State Police for the  
STARS project (Statewide Agency Radio System) and in 
conjunction with this VDOT spent $79,000  for the same 
project . This will allow all state agencies to communicate 
with each other in times of disasters and it has been 
expanded to local governments at this time. 
• $3,313,000 in the greater Richmond area to purchase a vehicle repeater system, upgrade 
dispatch consoles, and procure other essential communications equipment that will also 
the Capitol Police to communicate with neighboring Richmond jurisdictions. 
• FY 2005:  $7,363,000 to replace or enhance critical, basic interoperable communications 
equipment for local law 
enforcement, fire, and 
EMS throughout the 
counties of the state.

Seattle UASI is working on several urban wide projects that span 
multiple grant years. 
• Fiber Optic project:  For UASI II and 04 UASI the state will be 
laying or tapping into existing fiber optic cable networks to 
provide communication infrastructure for the EOCs and seats of government of the Urban 
Area partners.  The project is near completion and will allow connection from the 
Snohomish County EOC and County Executive’s Office to the Governor’s Office in 
Olympia.  The project also includes the purchase of comparable satellite phones for each 
site 
• Helicopter Downlink 
project: Out of 04 UASI 
funding the aviation 
assets and EOCs for each 
of the Urban Area 
partners is being fitted 
with video downlink 
capability.  This will 
allow video images from 
helicopters in any of the 
jurisdictions to transmit 
images to any or all of 
the EOCs in the urban 
area.

West Virginia has implemented a statewide interoperable 
communications project using a digital trunked radio system which 
utilizes a microwave communications backbone within the State. When 
completed, the communications system will enable first responders to 
maintain interoperable communications throughout WV.  This system has 
been implemented at key locations statewide, and is fully functional in the 
areas where the backbone and trunked sites have been completed, to date. 
Also, WV is cooperatively working with the surrounding States to implement interoperable 
communications capability.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
• 
Wisconsin has taken a regional approach with regard to communications 
interoperability. Wisconsin’s approach acknowledges that any statewide 
interoperable system must build on existing local systems, and these local 
systems vary according to the needs of different regions of the state. 
Consequently, the state has encouraged the development of regional 
interoperability groups that will link at key exchange points.  Several regional 
groups have already formed, including the Northeast Wisconsin 
Communications (NEWCOM) group, the West Central Interoperability Alliance (WCIA), the 
Northwest Radio Users (NWIOU), the Fox Valley Communications (FOXCOM) group, a central 
three-county effort, and a southeast Wisconsin regional group. Together these regional efforts 
account for 58 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, and region-based funding initiatives are encouraging 
the regionalization of the remainder of the counties.  
• 
Wisconsin is in the process of completing a statewide interoperability strategic plan.  This plan 
will help define operational and technical specifications to ensure performance standards are met, 
and establishing networking standards by December 2006.   In 2004, the Wisconsin Office of 
Justice Assistance (OJA) contracted with Federal Engineering, Inc. to conduct a statewide study 
of interoperable radio 
communication capabilities 
in Wisconsin and provide 
recommendations to guide 
development of a statewide 
interoperability strategy. 
Report recommendations 
resulted in the award of 
grants totaling $1.8 million 
for region-specific 
engineering studies.

Stopgap systems employed to provide on scene crisis communications: 
A number of subgrantees have expanded their Command and Control 
capacities through the purchase of mobile command posts and interoperable 
communications suites.  The state has purchased 7 ACU 1000 Interconnect 
communications system which allows disparate communications systems to 
work seamlessly on crisis scenes and has allowed the state to achieve 100% 
interoperability during high threat or crisis events. 
Long term strategy and investments into WYO-LINK to provide fully integrated IOC: 
The state has continued to expand the WYO-LINK Project, a unique initiative to ensure a 
comprehensive interoperable communications system throughout the State of Wyoming. The 
approach for this initiative included the creation of a specific steering committee dedicated to the 
administration of this project. WYO-LINK will connect all radio frequencies in the state through 
57 radio sites around Wyoming. All disciplines are included in the project which will include a 
high-band, digital radio network that will link current systems, old or new, but will not take away 
any current systems. Public 
safety agencies will move into 
the system at their own pace. 
This initiative will cost 
approximately $51 million 
dollars to complete and will be 
funded partially by G&T funds 
and partially by Wyoming State 
funds. FY05 G&T funds are 
almost exclusively dedicated to 
interoperable communications 
through this and other 
equipment initiatives.
