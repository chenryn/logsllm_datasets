User: Task 16: How to host local code on GitHub?
Assistant: 1. Create a GitHub account. If you already have an account, skip this step. 2. Create a new code repository. Click the New Repository button on your GitHub home page, fill in a name and description for the repository, and choose public or private. 3. Install Git on your local computer. Git is a project management tool that lets you manage your code on your local computer. 4. Open a command line terminal and type `git init` to initialize the local code base. This will create a new .git folder for tracking and version control of your project. 5. Add your native code to the repository. Use the command `git add .` to add all files to the repository, or `git add <file>` to add specific files to the repository. 6. Commit the changes using `git commit -m "initial commit"` command. You can add some comments in the commit message to describe the changes you made. 7. Link the local code repository and the GitHub repository. First copy your GitHub repository URL, then use the command `git remote add origin <GitHub repository URL>` to link your local repository to the GitHub repository. 8. Finally, push your code to the GitHub repository with `git push -u origin main`. This will push your local branch to the remote branch. 9. Verify on GitHub that your code has been successfully pushed. Refresh your GitHub repository page to make sure your code has been successfully pushed to the repository.
