User: I just installed python, mplayer, beautifulsoup and sipie to run Sirius on my Ubuntu 10.04 machine.  I followed some docs that seem straightforward, but am encountering some issues.  I'm not that familiar with Python, so this may be out of my league.
I was able to get everything installed, but then running sipie gives this:
/usr/bin/Sipie/Sipie/Config.py:12: DeprecationWarning: the md5 module is deprecated; use hashlib instead import md5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/Sipie/sipie.py", line 22, in <module>

    raise HTMLParseError(message, self.getpos())
HTMLParser.HTMLParseError: malformed start tag, at line 100, column 3
I looked through these files and the line numbers, but since I am unfamiliar with Python, it doesn't make much sense.  Any advice on what to do next?
Assistant: Look at column 3 of line 100 in the "data" that is mentioned in File "/usr/bin/Sipie/Sipie/Factory.py", line 298
