I understand that you have recently installed Python, MPlayer, BeautifulSoup, and Sipie on your Ubuntu 10.04 system in order to run Sirius, but are now encountering some issues. It's great that you were able to get everything installed, but I can see from the error message that you are facing a problem with running Sipie.

The error message indicates that there is a `DeprecationWarning` due to the use of the `md5` module, which is deprecated; it suggests using `hashlib` instead. However, the main issue seems to be related to an HTML parsing error when BeautifulSoup tries to parse some data.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of the error:

- **Deprecation Warning**: The `md5` module is deprecated. You should update the code to use `hashlib` instead. For example, replace `import md5` with `from hashlib import md5`.

- **HTML Parsing Error**: The error occurs at line 100, column 3 in the data being parsed by BeautifulSoup. This suggests that the HTML content at that position is malformed, causing the `HTMLParser` to raise an `HTMLParseError`.

To resolve these issues, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Code to Use `hashlib`**:
   - Open the file `/usr/bin/Sipie/Sipie/Config.py`.
   - Find the line where `import md5` is used.
   - Replace it with `from hashlib import md5`.

2. **Inspect the Malformed HTML**:
   - Open the file `/usr/bin/Sipie/Sipie/Factory.py`.
   - Go to line 298, which calls `BeautifulSoup(data)`.
   - Print out the `data` variable before passing it to BeautifulSoup to inspect its content. You can add the following line of code:
     ```python
     print(data)
     ```
   - Run the script again and check the printed output. Look for any malformed HTML tags around line 100, column 3.

3. **Fix the Malformed HTML**:
   - Once you identify the malformed HTML, correct it. Common issues include unclosed tags, mismatched tags, or invalid characters.
   - If the `data` is coming from an external source (e.g., a web page), ensure that the source is providing valid HTML.

If you are not comfortable with these steps or if the issue persists, you might want to seek help from someone more experienced with Python and HTML parsing. Additionally, you could consider using a more recent version of BeautifulSoup (version 4.x) as it has better error handling and support for modern Python versions.
