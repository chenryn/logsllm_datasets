### Environment
- **Windows Terminal (Preview)**
  - Version: 0.5.2681.0
- **PowerShell**
  - Platform: Win32NT
  - Service Pack: 10.0.18362.0
  - Version: Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0

### Steps to Reproduce

#### Scenario 1 (via RDP)
1. Open Windows Terminal with a PowerShell shell in a Windows Remote Desktop (RDP) session.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```powershell
   clear
   ls c:\ -recurse
   ```
3. Use a two-finger scroll gesture on the touchpad.
   - **Expected Result:** Vertical scrolling works.

#### Scenario 2 (via native Windows Desktop, i.e., no RDP session)
1. Open Windows Terminal with a PowerShell shell on the native Windows Desktop (not in an RDP session).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```powershell
   clear
   ls c:\ -recurse
   ```
3. Use a two-finger scroll gesture on the touchpad.
   - **Expected Result:** Vertical scrolling does not work.

**Note:** Both the standard "non-Windows Terminal (beta)" legacy built-in CMD and PowerShell terminals work as expected in both scenarios. This includes all four test cases.

### Expected Behavior
The two-finger scroll gesture on the touchpad should function as expected, similar to the behavior in legacy PowerShell and CMD terminals.

### Actual Behavior
Vertical scrolling using a two-finger gesture on the touchpad only works when using a Remote Desktop session. It does not function correctly when using the native Windows Desktop.
