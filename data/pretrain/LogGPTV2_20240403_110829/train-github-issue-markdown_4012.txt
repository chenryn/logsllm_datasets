# Environment
Windows Terminal (Preview)  
Version: 0.5.2681.0
PowerShell  
Platform ServicePack Version VersionString
* * *
Win32NT 10.0.18362.0 Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0
# Steps to reproduce
Scenario 1 (via RDP)  
From Windows Terminal Windows PowerShell shell running in a Windows Remote
Desktop (RDP) Session:
> clear  
>  ls c:\ -recurse  
>  Use 2 finger scroll gesture on touchpad -> Vertical scrolling works
Scenario 2 (via native Windows Desktop, i.e. no RDP session)  
From Windows Terminal Windows PowerShell shell running in a Windows Remote
Desktop (RDP) Session:
> clear  
>  ls c:\ -recurse  
>  Use 2 finger scroll gesture on touchpad-> Vertical scrolling does not work.
Also, note that both standard "non-Windows Terminal (beta)" legacy built-in
CMD and PowerShell terminals work as expected in both scenarios. I.e. All four
test cases.
# Expected behavior
Two-finger scroll gesture on the touchpad should work as expected just like in
legacy PowerShell and CMD terminals
# Actual behavior
Scrolling does not function except if one is using a Remote Desktop session.
