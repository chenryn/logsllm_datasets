### Title: Inside the Apple T2 Security Chip

**Abstract:**

Apple's T2 Security Chip was introduced to provide "a new level of integration and security" for the latest generation of Mac systems. This chip includes a secure enclave coprocessor that protects Touch ID data, enables encrypted storage, and provides secure boot capabilities. In this presentation, we will delve into the inner workings of the T2 chip, going beyond the limited technical details that Apple has publicly disclosed. We will also share our research methodology and the tools we developed, which we have released to help the audience understand our process and build on our initial findings.

**Objective:**

Our primary goal was to evaluate the current security posture of the T2 chip and to develop tools that would facilitate future research on the platform. Two key areas of focus were Apple's secure boot process and the communication between the T2 chip and macOS.

**Secure Boot Process:**

We will present a detailed analysis of the T2 chip's secure boot functionality, including how it operates, what types of attacks it mitigates, and what attack surfaces remain. Additionally, we will discuss Apple's implementation of eSPI (Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface) and its implications from an attacker's perspective.

**Communication with macOS:**

In our exploration of the T2 chip's communication, we reverse-engineered Apple's proprietary XPC (XNU Process Communication) protocol, which had virtually no third-party documentation. We decoded the messaging format and demonstrated the ability to interface directly with the T2 chip from unprivileged user-space code by developing our own client application. Our talk will cover methods and tools for querying the T2's exposed services, as well as decoding and encoding valid messages.

**Audience Takeaways:**

- An in-depth understanding of the T2 chip's architecture and its role in securing modern Mac systems.
- Insight into the secure boot process and the remaining attack surfaces.
- Knowledge of the XPC protocol and how it facilitates communication between the T2 chip and macOS.
- Access to the tools and methodologies we developed, enabling further research and development in this area.

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the T2 chip's security features and to empower the audience with the knowledge and tools needed to conduct their own research.
