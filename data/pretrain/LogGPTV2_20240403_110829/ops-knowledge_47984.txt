### Optimized Text

I am attempting to use the `mpdboot` command to start 4 processors for running my MPI program. I have created an `mpd.hosts` file with the following 4 nodes: 75, 77, 79, and 80. Each of these nodes is running Python 2.3.4. I have also modified the `.bashrc` and `.cshrc` files to ensure that the environment variables include the path to the compiler libraries. Additionally, I have set up the `mpd.conf` file and confirmed that it has the correct read-write (600) permissions.

Below is the output when I run `mpdboot`:

```sh
[n@heart]$ mpdboot -n 4 -r ssh
:38: Deprecation Warning: The popen2 module is deprecated. Use the subprocess module.
n@75's password:xxx
n@77's password:xxx
n@79's password:xxx
n@80's password:xxx
mpdboot_heart.int(err_exit 526): mpd failed to start correctly on heart.int
reason: 0: invalid port from mpd /opt/intel/mpi/2.0/bin/mpd.py:85: DeprecationWarning: the md5 module is deprecated; use hashlib instead
Killed
```

### Part 2

I also logged into one of the nodes and tried running `mpdboot`. Here is the output:

```sh
[n@79 ~]$ mpdboot -n 4 -r ssh
n@75's password:xxx
n@77's password:xxx
n@79's password:xxx
n@80's password:xxx
mpdboot_79_0 (mpdboot 499): problem has been detected during mpd(boot) startup at 1 75; output:
Permission denied, please try again.
n@75's password: Permission denied, please try again.
n@77's password: mpdboot_79_0 (mpdboot 515): problem has been detected during mpd(boot) startup at 2 77; output:
Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-with-mic,password).
n@77's password: Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-with-mic,password).
```

### How Should I Proceed?

Is `mpdboot` compatible with Python 2.3.4? This version is quite outdated, and I am not aware of any distributions that still ship this version. Have you considered using a more recent version, such as Python 2.7?

### Suggested Steps

1. **Update Python**: Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, such as Python 2.7 or even Python 3.x, if possible.
2. **Check SSH Permissions**: Ensure that the SSH keys are correctly set up and that the user has the necessary permissions to log in without being prompted for a password.
3. **Verify Configuration Files**: Double-check the `mpd.conf` and `mpd.hosts` files for any errors or misconfigurations.
4. **Review Logs**: Examine the logs for more detailed error messages that might provide additional clues about the issue.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issues and successfully start your MPI program.
