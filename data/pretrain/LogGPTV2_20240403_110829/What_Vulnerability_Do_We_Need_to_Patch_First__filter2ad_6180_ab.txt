2) Cost Analysis: We deﬁne the attack cost, C, as in
equation (4), and the path cost PC as in equation (5). The
host cost HC is calculated by evaluating the lower layer. The
attack cost calculation of the example networked system is
shown in equation (6), where MIN is the minimum PCi. We
assume HC4 = HC5 = 10, which is the maximum cost value
of an attack.
C =MIN(PCi,i ∈ {All possible attack paths})
PCi =SUM(HCj, j ∈ {Hosts in attack path i})
C =MIN(PCi,i ∈ {All possible attack paths})

D. Security Analysis using the Importance Measures
We consider Top-Down (TD), Bottom-Up (BU) and Hy-
brid (HB) methods using the combined IMs and compare
with the ES method. Descriptions of these methods are given
in the next subsections.
1) NCM and Security Metrics: We consider three NCMs;
(i) degree, (ii) closeness, and (iii) betweenness [19]. Com-
puting NCMs is described in [17]. Normalized NCM values
for the example networked system are shown in Table IV.
Vulnerabilities are ranked based on the risk and attack cost
metrics, and the top ﬁve vulnerabilities are shown in Table
V.
2) PSV using the TD Method: The ranking preference
is given to host values,
then vulnerability values. First,
we sort hosts by their NCM values. For the example net-
worked system, the order is H3, H1, H2 (H4 and H5 are
not considered for patching vulnerabilities as described in
section III). For each host, we rank vulnerabilities based
on the security metric used. Table VI shows the top ﬁve
vulnerabilities in the PSV based on the TD method. ES
Rank represents the vulnerability rankings from using the ES
method. We observe that the PSV using the TD method does
not match well with the ES method. Considering the top ﬁve
vulnerabilities to patch, three highly ranked vulnerabilities
(from the ES method) are in the risk based PSV (60%

The top priority vulnerability is correctly ranked for the risk

3) PSV using the BU Method: The ranking preference
is given to vulnerability values, then host values. We rank
all vulnerabilities, then reorder the list by host ranks for
conﬂicting vulnerability values. The top ﬁve vulnerabilities
in the PSV using the BU method is shown in Table VII. We
observe that the BU method matches reasonably well with
the ES method. However, some low ESRank vulnerabilities
are still ranked high, because the attack path information
is not taken into account. Considering the top ﬁve vulner-
abilities, four highly ranked vulnerabilities are in both the
risk and cost based PSV (80% included). The top priority
vulnerability is correctly ranked for the cost based PSV, but
not for the risk based PSV.

4) PSV using the HB Method: The ranking is based on
the values calculated from assigning weights to values of
hosts and vulnerabilities and combining them. We normal-
ized these values using the largest value as a factor. We cal-
culated the combined IMs value CVvul for each vulnerability
vul as in equation (7), where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 is the weight value.
NSvul is the host value for the host containing vul, and V Svul
is the vulnerability value of vul. We selected α = 0.5 as a
default value in our example. The top ﬁve vulnerabilities in
the PSV using the HB method is shown in Table VIII. We
observe that the PSV using the HB method matches better
than the TD and the BU methods. Considering the top ﬁve
vulnerabilities, four highly ranked vulnerabilities are in both
risk and cost based PSV (80% included). The top priority
vulnerability is correctly ranked for both the risk and cost
based PSV.
