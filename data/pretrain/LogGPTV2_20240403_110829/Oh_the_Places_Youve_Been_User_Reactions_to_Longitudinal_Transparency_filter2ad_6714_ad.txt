230 topics (25.2%) were inferred for 5 or fewer of the 425 partic-
ipants, suggesting Tracking Transparency captures personalized
interest profiles for users alongside some common topics.
Our telemetry data indicates participants clicked different parts
of the extension’s UI a median of 19 times (µ = 24.5, σ = 21.1). Users
opened the toolbar popup a median of 5 times (µ = 6.7, σ = 5.3)
and the dashboard a median of 3 times (µ = 3.1, σ = 2.5). Most
interactions occurred during the post-usage survey.
5.2 General Reactions
System usability. Participants rated Tracking Transparency as
highly usable on the ten-item System Usability Scale (SUS), scored
from 0–100. The median SUS score for Longitudinal:Interests was
82.5 (µ = 81.5, σ = 13.2). SUS scores differed by condition. The Lon-
gitudinal:Interests condition’s SUS score was significantly higher
than the Current:Connections condition’s median SUS score of 72.5
and the Control:Static condition’s median SUS score of 70.0. Scores
above 68 are typically considered above average [14].
Open-ended questions. Through open-ended questions, partici-
pants explained what information the extension presented that was
surprising, new to them, or that echoed what they already knew.
To minimize coding biases, we mixed together responses from all
conditions during coding. We observed significant differences by
condition in the codes assigned for information that was surprising
(χ2(35) = 374.0, p < .001), new (χ2(35) = 341.5, p < .001), or
already known (χ2(35) = 221.4, p < .001). Table 2 summarizes
participants’ responses to these open-ended questions.
Surprising. Over 90% of participants were surprised by some-
thing presented in Longitudinal:Interests, the extension’s full ver-
sion, while 73% of participants who saw Control:Static, the least
informative variant, reported they did not find anything surprising.
Participants were surprised by the amount of tracking displayed
and the number of trackers. This was echoed by almost half of
participants in conditions where participants saw longitudinal in-
formation, compared to less than 10% in the control conditions.
The extension also revealed surprising information about the inter-
ests inferred and the detail of data collected by trackers, according
to 22% of participants in Longitudinal:Interests. Interestingly, 13%
of participants in Control:Static were surprised by how interests
are inferred, potentially because this information was made more
salient in this otherwise sparse version of the extension.
Further, and as expected, the condition influenced which classes
of information were surprising. For example, 49% of participants in
the Control:Browsing Only condition, which focused on browsing

Differences were significant for the four leftmost intentions, and marginally significant for the two rightmost.
information, were surprised by their browsing habits. Similarly, 16%
of Current:Connections participants were surprised by connections
between trackers.
New information. Tracking Transparency increased participants’
awareness of the magnitude of tracking that occurred in their daily
browsing. 56% of Longitudinal:Interests participants reported learn-
ing about the number of trackers that were tracking their browsing
activity. Similarly, for 27% of Longitudinal:Interests participants,
the pervasiveness of tracking across sites was also new information.
For example, P65 remarked, “The thing I learned is I was being
tracked a lot more than I thought originally. I thought some sites
weren’t big in the tracking game, boy was I wrong!”
The extension provided transparency into the use of inferred
interests in tracking for 21% of Longitudinal:Interests participants:
“I learned that companies will infer and guess what items I may
like” (P232). This was also new for P161: “It shows my top interest
is shopping, which i didn’t figure that to be true, since i usually
hate shopping. but it made me realize that i do a lot of shopping
online now. that’s new to me. It’s also new that I have 75 potential
interests.” In comparison, few participants in the other conditions
reported learning new information about inferences.
Other classes of new information reported reflected informa-
tion shown only in their condition: 54% of Control:Browsing Only
participants learned about their browsing habits, and 11% of Cur-
rent:Connections participants about tracker connections.
Already knew. Many participants had some familiarity with
tracking before using the extension. Across all conditions, 56%
said they already knew tracking occurred, and another 16% knew it
was prevalent: “I expected a lot of tracking from google, facebook,
amazon and other large sites” (P11). For 22% and 5% of partici-
pants, it was not new information that tracking was used for ads
or targeting, respectively. A minority of participants — 11% in the
Longitudinal:Interests condition — already knew that interests can
be inferred from browsing. Finally, 6% of participants already knew
about tracking methods, frequently mentioning cookies: “I knew
about tracking cookies, pixels, and fingerprinting” (P215).
Additional questions. We also asked participants if they had any
additional questions about what they saw in the extension. The
most common question was how to gain more control of their
information or block trackers (asked by 64 participants across con-
ditions). 35 participants had questions about how tracking worked,
and another 34 wanted to know more about the information track-
ers get about them. 19 participants wanted to know more about
what trackers do with their information, and 10 even wondered
whether tracking was safe or legal. P173 asked, “I would like to
know if the sites tracking me are safe or not. Like I can see that
Yahoo sometimes tracks, and I will assume that’s safe enough, but
the comScore one, I’m thinking it’s sketchy.” P105 wondered, “is
this legal? is it ethical for these companies to invade my privacy?”
5.3 Impact on Intended Behaviors
In the post-usage survey, we asked participants to rate how their
likelihood to take six different actions changed after using the
extension. Figure 4 presents the results. Across conditions, partici-
pants overwhelmingly reported increased intention to take privacy-
protective actions like using tracker-blocking tools, which may
indicate a social desirability bias. Nonetheless, intentions differed
significantly by condition for most of these six actions. Condi-
tions richer in information (e.g., Longitudinal:Interests) generally
increased these intentions more. These differences show how richer
displays contributed to meaningful increases in awareness and in-
terest in behavioral changes. The comparisons between conditions
mentioned in this section are all statistically significant. Table 4
in the appendix provides the full statistical results. For four of the
six actions, the omnibus test across all conditions was statistically
significant. For the remaining two, it was marginally significant.
Seeking out more information. 65.8% of Longitudinal:Interests
participants reported being between a little more likely and much
more likely “to seek out more information about online adver-
tising,” and these intentions varied by condition. The Longitudi-
nal:Interests condition displayed the most information about lon-
gitudinal tracking. Thus, participants in this condition were more
likely to report an intention to seek out more information than those
in Current:Connections, which only showed snapshots of tracker
connections in their browsing, as well as those in Control:Static,
which only showed static descriptions.

Among the Longitudinal:Interests participants,
71.2% reported being at least a little more likely “to use a browser’s
private browsing mode” after using Tracking Transparency. Partic-
ipants who saw a representation of current tools were more likely
to report an intention to use private browsing than those who only
saw static descriptions of third-party tracking. Additionally, partic-
ipants who saw the fully featured Longitudinal:Interests were also
more likely to report intending to use private browsing than those
who saw Control:Static or Control:Browsing Only.
Blocking tools and Do Not Track. Participants’ reported likelihood
“to use browser extensions that block ads and/or online tracking”
varied by condition. Reported likelihood to enable their browser’s
Do Not Track (DNT) setting also varied by condition. Participants
who saw our fully featured Longitudinal:Interests or a represen-
tation of a current tool were more likely to express an intention
to use blocking tools and enable DNT than those who saw static
descriptions. While users may not have understood the DNT setting
does very little, the responses indicate that participants in more
fully featured conditions expressed stronger desire to stop tracking.
Other results. After correcting for multiple testing, differences
by condition in participants’ responses to “Compared to before you
used the extension, how likely are you to click on ads now?” were
only marginally significant (KW χ2(5) = 12.663, p = .054). We
also asked about changes in likelihood to look at a page provided
by advertising companies “to show you what topics they guessed
you are interested in,” again finding that omnibus differences were
again marginally significant (KW χ2(5) = 10.528, p = .062) and
were not significant for any pairwise comparisons.
5.4 Users’ Knowledge and Attitudes
Knowledge of targeting. To understand how the extension im-
pacted participants’ knowledge of targeted advertising, participants
rated the likelihood that fifteen types of information and three
broad practices are used to target ads. Participants’ responses were
generally accurate. They did not change significantly between the
pre-usage and post-usage surveys, nor did they vary by condition.
This may be attributable to a ceiling effect. That is, participants were
mostly correct even before the study, capping potential increases.
Participants correctly expected that companies likely targeted
ads to them based on their current and past browsing, as well as
guesses about their demographics and interests. Between the pre-
and post-usage surveys, we observed a significant increase across
all conditions in participants’ expectation that companies target
ads based on guesses about their interests (β = −1.038, p < 0.001).
