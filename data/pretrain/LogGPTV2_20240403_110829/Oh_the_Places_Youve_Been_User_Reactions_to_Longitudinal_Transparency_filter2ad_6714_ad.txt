### 5.1 Interaction with the Extension

Our telemetry data indicates that participants interacted with different parts of the extension's user interface (UI) a median of 19 times (mean = 24.5, standard deviation = 21.1). Specifically, users opened the toolbar popup a median of 5 times (mean = 6.7, standard deviation = 5.3) and the dashboard a median of 3 times (mean = 3.1, standard deviation = 2.5). The majority of these interactions occurred during the post-usage survey.

### 5.2 General Reactions

#### System Usability
Participants rated the usability of Tracking Transparency using the ten-item System Usability Scale (SUS), which is scored from 0 to 100. The median SUS score for the Longitudinal:Interests condition was 82.5 (mean = 81.5, standard deviation = 13.2). This score was significantly higher than the median SUS scores for the Current:Connections condition (72.5) and the Control:Static condition (70.0). Scores above 68 are generally considered above average [14].

#### Open-Ended Questions
Through open-ended questions, participants provided insights into what information the extension presented that was surprising, new to them, or confirmed their existing knowledge. To minimize coding biases, we mixed responses from all conditions during the coding process. We observed significant differences by condition in the codes assigned for information that was surprising (χ²(35) = 374.0, p < .001), new (χ²(35) = 341.5, p < .001), or already known (χ²(35) = 221.4, p < .001). Table 2 summarizes participants' responses to these open-ended questions.

**Surprising Information:**
- Over 90% of participants in the Longitudinal:Interests condition were surprised by something presented, while only 73% of those in the Control:Static condition reported no surprises.
- Participants were particularly surprised by the amount of tracking and the number of trackers. This was echoed by almost half of the participants in conditions with longitudinal information, compared to less than 10% in the control conditions.
- 22% of participants in the Longitudinal:Interests condition were surprised by the interests inferred and the detailed data collected by trackers. Interestingly, 13% of participants in the Control:Static condition were surprised by how interests are inferred, possibly due to the increased salience of this information in an otherwise sparse version of the extension.

**New Information:**
- Tracking Transparency increased participants' awareness of the extent of tracking in their daily browsing. 56% of participants in the Longitudinal:Interests condition learned about the number of trackers following their browsing activity.
- For 27% of Longitudinal:Interests participants, the pervasiveness of tracking across sites was new information. For example, P65 remarked, "I was being tracked a lot more than I thought originally. I thought some sites weren't big in the tracking game, but I was wrong!"
- The extension provided transparency into the use of inferred interests for 21% of Longitudinal:Interests participants. P232 noted, "I learned that companies will infer and guess what items I may like." P161 also found it new: "It shows my top interest is shopping, which I didn’t think was true, but it made me realize I do a lot of shopping online now."

**Already Knew:**
- Many participants had some prior familiarity with tracking. Across all conditions, 56% said they already knew tracking occurred, and 16% knew it was prevalent. P11 stated, "I expected a lot of tracking from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other large sites."
- For 22% and 5% of participants, it was not new information that tracking was used for ads or targeting, respectively. A minority (11%) in the Longitudinal:Interests condition already knew that interests can be inferred from browsing. Finally, 6% of participants, such as P215, already knew about tracking methods, including cookies, pixels, and fingerprinting.

**Additional Questions:**
- Participants also asked additional questions about the extension. The most common question (asked by 64 participants) was how to gain more control over their information or block trackers. 
- 35 participants had questions about how tracking works, and another 34 wanted to know more about the information trackers collect about them.
- 19 participants were curious about what trackers do with their information, and 10 wondered about the safety and legality of tracking. P173 asked, "I would like to know if the sites tracking me are safe or not. Like, I can see that Yahoo sometimes tracks, and I will assume that’s safe enough, but the comScore one, I’m thinking it’s sketchy." P105 wondered, "Is this legal? Is it ethical for these companies to invade my privacy?"

### 5.3 Impact on Intended Behaviors

In the post-usage survey, participants rated how their likelihood to take six different actions changed after using the extension. Figure 4 presents the results. Across conditions, participants overwhelmingly reported increased intentions to take privacy-protective actions, such as using tracker-blocking tools, which may indicate a social desirability bias. Nonetheless, intentions varied significantly by condition for most of these six actions. Conditions richer in information (e.g., Longitudinal:Interests) generally increased these intentions more. These differences highlight how richer displays contributed to meaningful increases in awareness and interest in behavioral changes. The comparisons between conditions mentioned in this section are statistically significant. Table 4 in the appendix provides the full statistical results. For four of the six actions, the omnibus test across all conditions was statistically significant. For the remaining two, it was marginally significant.

**Seeking Out More Information:**
- 65.8% of Longitudinal:Interests participants reported being more likely to "seek out more information about online advertising," and these intentions varied by condition. The Longitudinal:Interests condition displayed the most information about longitudinal tracking, making participants in this condition more likely to report an intention to seek out more information than those in the Current:Connections and Control:Static conditions.

**Private Browsing:**
- Among Longitudinal:Interests participants, 71.2% reported being at least a little more likely to "use a browser’s private browsing mode" after using Tracking Transparency. Participants who saw a representation of current tools were more likely to report an intention to use private browsing than those who only saw static descriptions of third-party tracking. Additionally, participants who saw the fully featured Longitudinal:Interests were more likely to report intending to use private browsing than those in the Control:Static or Control:Browsing Only conditions.

**Blocking Tools and Do Not Track:**
- Participants' reported likelihood to "use browser extensions that block ads and/or online tracking" varied by condition. The reported likelihood to enable their browser’s Do Not Track (DNT) setting also varied. Participants who saw the fully featured Longitudinal:Interests or a representation of a current tool were more likely to express an intention to use blocking tools and enable DNT than those who saw static descriptions. While users may not have understood that the DNT setting does very little, the responses indicate that participants in more fully featured conditions expressed a stronger desire to stop tracking.

**Other Results:**
- After correcting for multiple testing, differences by condition in participants' responses to "Compared to before you used the extension, how likely are you to click on ads now?" were only marginally significant (KW χ²(5) = 12.663, p = .054).
- We also asked about changes in the likelihood to look at a page provided by advertising companies "to show you what topics they guessed you are interested in." Omnibus differences were marginally significant (KW χ²(5) = 10.528, p = .062) and not significant for any pairwise comparisons.

### 5.4 Users’ Knowledge and Attitudes

#### Knowledge of Targeting
To understand the impact of the extension on participants' knowledge of targeted advertising, they rated the likelihood that fifteen types of information and three broad practices are used to target ads. Participants' responses were generally accurate and did not change significantly between the pre-usage and post-usage surveys, nor did they vary by condition. This may be due to a ceiling effect, where participants were mostly correct even before the study, limiting potential increases.

Participants correctly expected that companies target ads based on their current and past browsing, as well as guesses about their demographics and interests. Between the pre- and post-usage surveys, there was a significant increase across all conditions in participants' expectation that companies target ads based on guesses about their interests (β = −1.038, p < 0.001).
