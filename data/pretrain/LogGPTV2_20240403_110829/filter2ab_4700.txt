**ATT&CK ID:** T1542.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** TFTP Boot

Adversaries may exploit the netbooting process to load an unauthorized operating system onto a network device from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP boot, also known as netbooting, is a common practice among network administrators for loading configuration-controlled images of network devices from a centralized management server. This method is often used to centralize, manage, and control device images, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance. However, if not properly secured, this process can be hijacked by attackers to deploy malicious firmware or configurations, potentially leading to a compromise of the network infrastructure.
