I find that Popovers with 'click' as its trigger is kind of useless when you
have many of them opened at the same time, and you have to manually go through
and close each one of them. Can we request to have ONE additional popover
option?
data-backdrop
Which works the same like modals closing on click. I believe this is rather
straight forward and we will find very useful.
