User: I'm new to the world of AWS, and I just wrote and deployed a small Pyramid application. I ran into some problems getting set up, but after I got it working, everything seemed to be fine. However, now, my deployments don't seem to be making a difference in the environment (I changed the index.pt file that my root url routed to, and it does not register on my-app.elasticbeanstalk.com).
Is there some sort of delay to the deployments that I am unaware of, or is there a problem with how I'm deploying (eb deploy using the awsebcli package) that's causing these updates to my application to not show?
Assistant: Are you committing your changes before deploying?
eb deploy will deploy the HEAD commit.
You can do eb deploy --staged to deploy staged changes.
