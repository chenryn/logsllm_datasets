I am currently developing an application that needs to print several pages using Python. The content of these pages will include tables, images, and text, and the solution should be compatible with both Linux and Windows operating systems. I have already developed the graphical user interface (GUI) using PyGTK. However, I believe it would be more practical to generate the pages as either images or PDF files for printing. Unfortunately, I am unsure how to accomplish this. Specifically, my challenge is not in generating the files but in actually printing them. Does anyone have any recommendations for a good approach to this?

In response to your question, one possible method you might consider is generating HTML. This could then be converted into a PDF, which can easily be printed on most operating systems. There are various libraries available in Python, such as `pdfkit` or `weasyprint`, that allow you to convert HTML to PDF. These tools are quite powerful and support CSS styling, enabling you to create complex layouts, including tables and images, with relative ease.
