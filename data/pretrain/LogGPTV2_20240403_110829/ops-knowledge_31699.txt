User: I am developing an application which has to be able to print a couple of pages with Python. Now I am searching for a method to create these pages and print them. It should work on Linux and Windows. The pages contain tables, images and text.
I developed the GUI with PyGtk, but I think it's convenient to create an image or PDF and print it. I have no idea how to do this. Anyone knows a good way for this?
Note: The problem isn't the generation. It is the printing of that file.
Assistant: Have you considered generating HTML?
