I have seen evidence that both tuple indexing and slicing syntax are silently
allowed by `rustc`, rather than requiring the feature gate turned on to enable
them.
It could be that I missed some step along the way where these features were
officially enabled. But I think its more likely that someone has accidentally
turned them both on somehow, especially since the team discussion from last
Thursday on #18006 included statements that tuple-indexing is meant to be
feature gated.

    fn main() {
        let t = ('a', 'b', 'c');
        let v = vec!['x', 'y', 'z'];
        println!("t: {} v: {}", t.1, v[]);
    }
