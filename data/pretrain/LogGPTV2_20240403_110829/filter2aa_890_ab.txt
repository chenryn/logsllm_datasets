### Introduction
This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DNS fragmentation attacks, IPID inference, and the mitigation strategies. The content is based on several key research papers, including "Fragmentation Considered Poisonous" by Amir Herzberg and Haya Shulman (2012) and "ONIS: Inferring TCP/IP-based Trust Relationships Completely Off-Path" by Zhang, Knockel, and Crandall (2018).

### Background on DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) is a critical component of the Internet, translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses. DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) adds security by providing authentication and integrity for DNS data. However, it also introduces additional complexity and potential vulnerabilities.

### Fragmentation Attacks
#### Ideal Poisoning Scenario
- **Puppet**: A compromised or controlled DNS resolver.
- **Attacker**: The entity initiating the attack.
- **Target**: The intended victim of the attack.
- **Internet**: The broader network environment.
- **Cache**: The DNS cache that can be poisoned.

In an ideal poisoning scenario, the attacker manipulates the DNS cache to redirect traffic to malicious servers. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as subdomain injection, NS hijacking, and NS blocking.

### IPID Inference
IPID (IP Identification) is a 16-bit field in the IP header used to uniquely identify fragments of a datagram. Sequential and global IPID counters are common, but they can be exploited for attacks.

#### Maliciously Forcing Fragmentation
- **IPID Sequence**: 5002, 5003, 5004, ..., 5012
- **Cache Size**: 64 fragments

With IPv6, the IPID in the fragmentation extension header is 32 bits, allowing for a larger cache. Realistic average iterations for an attack are around 34 million, while an unrealistic ideal average is around 17 million.

### The Attack (Agnostic to IPv4 and IPv6)
The attack involves finding collisions in IPID values and exploiting them to perform DNS cache poisoning. This can be done off-path, making it more challenging to detect.

#### Finding Collisions Off-Path
- **IPv6 Address Space**: Use the large address space of IPv6 to find hash collisions.
- **Zombie to Target Increment**: Identify the increment from a zombie to the target.
- **Timing**: Most systems have a timing of ~10ms, but it can be as low as ~0.66ms.

### Mitigations
#### For Resolvers
1. **Handle Fragments Pre-Assembly**: Untrusted content in later UDP fragments should trigger re-queries over TCP.
2. **Cap EDNS Buffer Size**: Limit the EDNS buffer size to ~1220 bytes to avoid IPv6 fragmentation.
3. **Drop All Fragments**: Drop all fragmented packets, including IPv6, and re-query larger payloads over TCP.
4. **Implement Flag Day 2020+ Plans**: Follow the recommendations from DNS Flag Day 2020.

#### For Nameservers
1. **Limit EDNS Over UDP**: Serve large responses over TCP instead of UDP.
2. **Disable, Fuzz, or Limit ICMP Responses**: Handle ICMP separately with a non-kernel process and limit the speed of replies.
3. **Roll Your Own Kernel**: Change the `IP_IDENTS_SZ` value to a higher number and recompile the kernel.
4. **Deploy DNSSEC**: Use strong signing keys to prevent tampering with A records.

#### For Domains
1. **Deploy DNSSEC**: Implement DNSSEC with good signing keys to prevent outright tampering with A records.

### Pertinent Limitations
- **Umbrella Implementation**: Prior to April 2019, Umbrella used IPv6 whenever possible and detected IPv4 fragments, re-querying over TCP.
- **OARC 30 Presentation**: A presentation at OARC 30 in May 2019 highlighted some of these issues, but the presentation was not directly related to the current work.
