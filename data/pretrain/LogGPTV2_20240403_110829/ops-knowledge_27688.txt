User: Is there a way to dynamically determine whether the currently executing task is a standard http request or a TaskQueue?
In some parts of my request handler, I make a few urlfetches. I would like the timeout delay of the url fetch to be short if the request is a standard http request and long if it is a TaskQueue.
Assistant: Pick any one of the following HTTP headers:

X-AppEngine-QueueName, the name of the queue (possibly default)
X-AppEngine-TaskName, the name of the task, or a system-generated unique ID if no name was specified
X-AppEngine-TaskRetryCount, the number of times this task has been retried; for the first attempt, this value is 0
X-AppEngine-TaskETA, the target execution time of the task, specified in microseconds since January 1st 1970.

Standard HTTP requests won't have these headers.
