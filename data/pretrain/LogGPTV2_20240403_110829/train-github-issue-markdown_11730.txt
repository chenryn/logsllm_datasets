Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-target-a-specific-
child-of-an-element-using-jquery has an issue.
The instructions say to input _$(".well :nth-child(2)").addClass("animated
bounce");_ or _$(".target:nth-child(2)").addClass("animated bounce");_ —and in
fact, both work well—, but I doubt most beginners will gather this nuance from
the text.
I believe an explanation is due on how the one with space searches for the
second child inside, whereas the one without searches for the second sibling.
