### 5.2 Defending Against Fabrication and Suspension Attacks

To evaluate the effectiveness of CIDS in detecting fabrication and suspension attacks, we conducted experiments on both a CAN bus prototype and a real vehicle (Honda Accord 2013). In these experiments, CIDS was configured to perform per-message detection. We will later evaluate CIDS with message-pairwise detection.

#### CAN Bus Prototype

**Fabrication Attack:**
- **Setup:** ECU B was programmed to inject a fabricated message at \( t = 400 \) seconds with ID=0x11, which is a periodic message usually sent by ECU A. This simulates a fabrication attack on ECU A.
- **Detection:** ECU R, running CIDS, monitored message 0x11 and derived the accumulated clock offset (\( O_{\text{acc}} \)), identification error (\( e \)), and control limits (\( L^+ \) and \( L^- \)).
- **Results:** As shown in Figure 6(a), the presence of the fabrication attack caused a sudden positive shift in \( O_{\text{acc}} \), leading to a high identification error. Consequently, the upper control limit \( L^+ \) of the CUSUM increased and exceeded the threshold \( \Gamma_L = 5 \), indicating an intrusion.

**Suspension Attack:**
- **Setup:** ECU A was programmed to stop transmitting message 0x11 at \( t = 400 \) seconds.
- **Detection:** Similar to the fabrication attack, the suspension attack also caused a significant shift in \( O_{\text{acc}} \).
- **Results:** As shown in Figure 6(b), this shift allowed CIDS to detect the suspension attack.

#### Real Vehicle (Honda Accord 2013)

**Fabrication Attack:**
- **Setup:** One CAN node (R) was programmed to run CIDS, while another node (A) was used to mount the attack on a real ECU. The attack involved injecting a fabricated message with ID=0x1B0, which is a periodic message sent every 20 ms by a real in-vehicle ECU.
- **Detection:** CIDS monitored the changes in \( O_{\text{acc}} \), \( e \), and \( L^+ \).
- **Results:** As shown in Figure 7(a), the injected attack message at around \( t = 420 \) seconds caused a sudden increase in \( O_{\text{acc}} \) and \( e \), leading \( L^+ \) to exceed the threshold \( \Gamma_L = 5 \). This resulted in CIDS detecting the attack. After the attack, the slope of the \( O_{\text{acc}} \) graph remained unchanged because the real ECU continued to send message 0x1B0 periodically.

**Suspension Attack:**
- **Setup:** The message filter of node R was reset at \( t = 420 \) seconds to no longer receive message 0x1B0, simulating a suspension attack.
- **Detection:** CIDS monitored the changes in \( O_{\text{acc}} \), \( e \), and \( L^+ \).
- **Results:** As shown in Figure 7(b), the suspension attack increased the offset values, causing \( L^+ \) to exceed the threshold, thus allowing CIDS to detect the attack.

These results demonstrate that CIDS's fingerprinting is not limited to a specific vehicle model and can be applied to other vehicle models as well.

### Figures

**Figure 6:**
- **(a) Fabrication Attack:** Shows the changes in \( O_{\text{acc}} \), \( e \), and \( L^+ \) for message 0x11 in the presence and absence of a fabrication attack.
- **(b) Suspension Attack:** Shows the changes in \( O_{\text{acc}} \), \( e \), and \( L^+ \) for message 0x11 in the presence and absence of a suspension attack.

**Figure 7:**
- **(a) Fabrication Attack:** Shows the changes in \( O_{\text{acc}} \), \( e \), and \( L^+ \) for message 0x1B0 in the presence and absence of a fabrication attack.
- **(b) Suspension Attack:** Shows the changes in \( O_{\text{acc}} \), \( e \), and \( L^+ \) for message 0x1B0 in the presence and absence of a suspension attack.

**Figure 8:**
- **Message Interval [ms]:** Shows the frequency distribution of message intervals for messages 0x55 and 0x1B0 before and after the attacks.

These figures provide visual evidence of the effectiveness of CIDS in detecting both fabrication and suspension attacks in both the CAN bus prototype and the real vehicle setting.
