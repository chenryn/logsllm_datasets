Abstract. This paper makes two contributions: (i) it presents a scheme
for classifying and identifying Internet traﬃc ﬂows which carry a large
number of packets (or bytes) and are persistent in nature (also known
as the elephants), from ﬂows which carry a small number of packets (or
bytes) and die out fast (commonly referred to as the mice), and (ii)
illustrates how non-parametric Parzen window technique can be used to
construct the probability density function (pdf) of the elephants present
in the original traﬃc stream. We validate our approach using a 15-minute
trace containing around 23 million packets from NLANR.
1 Introduction
There are two main aspects to the problem of Internet traﬃc ﬂow characteri-
zation: (i) how to eﬃciently collect the ﬂows, and (ii) how to accurately infer
overall traﬃc behavior from the collected data. Due to limitations in hardware
capabilities, it has been illustrated in [7] [22] how exhaustively collecting all pack-
ets of a ﬂow does not scale well at high link speeds (OC-48+). Thus, current
approaches to ﬂow characterization are either based on: (i) statistical sampling
of the packets [5][6], or (ii) inferring traﬃc characteristics primarily based on
ﬂows which carry a large number of packets (or bytes) and are long-lived in na-
ture) (i.e., the elephants) while ignoring ﬂows which carry very small number of
packets (or bytes) and are short-lived in nature (i.e., the mice) [10], or (iii) using
appropriate estimation algorithms on lossy data structures (e.g., bloom ﬁlters,
hash tables) [7][17] for recovering lost information. However, even in sampled
traﬃc, separation of elephants and mice is a cumbersome task [8] since there
exists no standard approaches to drawing the line between the two.
In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to provide an analytical
framework for identifying and classifying packets as elephants or mice by apply-
ing Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) from Information Theory [18]. It
is based on the observation that all mice die young and are large in number;
while the proportion of elephants is small in number (around 1% − 2% of the
traﬃc volume) and they have average longevity varying from a few minutes to
days [1]. If the state space of the Internet ﬂows is visualized to be an ergodic
random process, then the existence of typical sequence, as deﬁned by AEP, iden-
tiﬁes the presence of elephants in the traﬃc volume. Such an approach requires

no prior knowledge of ﬂow distribution, does not suﬀer from the side eﬀects of
false positives associated with Bayesian analysis, and involves minimal packet
processing. We compare our approach with the well-known method of identifying
packets as elephants based on the average ﬂow longevity of greater than 15 min-
utes [8]. Our results from initial analysis on a single 15-minute traﬃc trace from
NLANR [15] indicates that there exists a possibility that using deﬁnite values
of longevity as cutoﬀ limits for classifying ﬂows as elephnats might overestimate
the frequency of occurence of such ﬂows. In the second part of the paper, we use
a statistical non-parametric estimation technique based on the Gaussian kernel
function for accurately estimating the density function of the underlying traﬃc,
considering the probability density function (pdf) of only the elephants.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present
the theory and online framework for classifying traﬃc ﬂows into elephants and
mice. This is followed by Section 3 which brieﬂy presents the theory for estimat-
ing the distribution of the elephants. Evaluating the eﬀectiveness of our approach
is carried out in Section 4 with conclusions in Section 5.
2 An Online Framework for Identifying the Elephants
In this work, we deﬁne traﬃc ﬂows to refer to packets with similar attributes.
For example, a ﬂow might be deﬁned to consist of packets having identical val-
ues of ﬁve-tuple (source address, destination address, source port, destination
port, protocol) or might be deﬁned to comprise of packets matching speciﬁc
payload information (e.g., group of all TCP packets with payload containing the
string “crewman”). Thus, ﬂows can be characterized by packet headers, pay-
loads or a combination of both. The size of a ﬂow is the number of packets
(or bytes) belonging to the ﬂow and the duration of a ﬂow is its lifetime. Let
[F] = {F1, F2, . . . , Fi, . . . , FN} be a sequence of N FlowIDs {1, 2, . . . i, . . . N},
where each FlowID, Fi, is an index (i.e., a number between 1 and N) used to
identify each ﬂow in the underlying traﬃc. Denote |Fi| to represent the number
of packets belonging to the ﬂow with FlowID Fi. It is important to note that the
sequence [F] is sorted by increasing cardinality of the number of packets present
in each FlowID. Under such circumstances, the ﬂow classiﬁcation problem is to
identify and separate the Fis that deﬁne the elephants and the mice. Now let us
now consider an ergodic and discrete random process where each Fi is an inde-
pendent variable drawn from the state space of [F]. The state space of [F] con-
sists of all possible FlowIDs. However, the random variables are not identically
distributed. Denote {fi} to be the set of possible outcomes of Fi with f ∈ [F].
Let us represent the probability mass function (pmf) of the sequence {Fi}N
i=1 by:
P (F1 = f1, . . . , FN = fN ) = p (f1, . . . fN ) Let H(F) = H(F1, F2, . . . , FN ) denote
the joint entropy of the sequence {Fi}N
i=1 and denote ¯HF to be the entropy rate
of {Fi}N
i=1. Then, H(F) and ¯HF are deﬁned as follows [18]:
H(F) = H(F1, F2, . . . , FN ) =

(cid:3)
Since according to our assumption, the Fis are independent, Equation (1) re-
duces to: H(F) =
i=1 H(Fi) which is the summation of the individual entropies
of the ﬂow. At this point, it is worth mentioning that it is possible to estimate
H(F) without considering individual ﬂow entropies [13]. However, this is not
considered in this work.

of elephants. Since our aim is to identify the sequence {F1, F2, . . . , FN
need to isolate the sequence of FlowIDs that form the high probability set. If we
visualize the set, [F], as an information source, then the existence of the above
sequence of FlowIDs is governed by the probability of occurrence of a jointly typ-
ical sequence based on AEP. Note that the results based on AEP hold true only
when the number of FlowIDs present in the sampled traﬃc volume is very large.
Now considering the fact that there can be several sets of typical sequences, we
have the following lemma for the set of elephants:
Lemma 1. For traﬃc volumes with large number of FlowIDs (i.e., N → ∞),
(cid:2) (cid:3) N, is equiprobable and
the occurrence of the sequence {F1, F2, . . . , FN
approximately equal to 2−N ¯HF .
(cid:2)}, N
Lemma 1 follows directly from the property of AEP. In view of the above, we
can say that out of all the possible FlowIDs, that sequence which belongs to the
typical set has the maximum concentration of probability. The sequences outside
the typical set are atypical and their probability of occurrence is extremely low.
As evident from the above lemma, a typical sequence implies that FlowIDs in
the typical set are associated with a large number of packets. If we consider the
distribution of FlowIDs in the Internet traﬃc, we can easily correlate this prop-
erty with the Zipf distribution of Internet ﬂows. Hence, it is not surprising that
most of the elephants belong to the typical set. However, what is the guarantee
that such a sequence really exists?
Deﬁnition 2. The joint entropy, H(F) for a stationary, stochastic process is a
decreasing sequence in N and has a limit equal to its entropy rate.
Deﬁnition 2 implies that the probability of correctly identifying elephants in-
creases with the corresponding increase in traﬃc volume. This observation is of
fundamental nature since it enables us to scalably create an approximate list of
LLFs (i.e., a typical sequence), while avoiding needless complex computation.

3 Estimating the Density of Elephants Flows
We employ the Parzen window [19] technique (explained below) on the set F
for determining the density of the identiﬁed elephants. Note that the likelihood
estimator from the coupon collector problem [23] can be employed on the sam-
pled set of all elephants in order to identify the set of all elephants present in
the underlying traﬃc. However, that aspect is not presented in this work. The
standard method is to choose a well-deﬁned kernel function (e.g., Gaussian) of
deﬁnite width and convolve it with the known data points. Let ˆfh(x) be the pdf
of the random variable X we are trying to estimate for the set F and be deﬁned
as [19]:

the estimated pdf is a linear combination of kernel functions centered on indi-
vidual xi. In Equation (4), the bandwidth factor h is the most important term
in the estimation process [20]. The optimal value of the kernel window h can

In general, the process of ﬁnding the optimal window size is cumbersome as we
do not know beforehand the nature of the density function that we are trying
to estimate. Since the shape (degree of smoothness) of ˆfh(x) is closely related
to the kernel function used, we use the Gaussian kernel function to eliminate
“noises” in the pdf estimation. Thus:

Corresponding to the Gaussian kernel, the bandwidth h can be approximated us-

4 Performance Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm using packet traces
obtained from NLANR [15]. We compare our approach with the results of Mori
et al. [8] in the ﬁgures) for comparing the number of elephants detected in
the traﬃc stream. Speciﬁcally, we use three traces: (i) 20040130-133500-0.gz,
(ii) 20040130-13400-0.gz, and (iii) 20040130-134500-0.gz. The cumulative
duration of the three ﬁles is 900 seconds and contains 23.2 million packets. They
subsequently map to 618, 225 FlowIDs, where each FlowID is deﬁned using the
number of packets.
4.1 Identifying the Elephants
In Figure 2, we plot the number of elephants predicted using our classiﬁcation
algorithm and compare it with the approach of [8]. We have used the frequency

Apart from the already known facts that the proportion of elephants are small
in number (0.0035% in our case), two important conclusions can be immediately
drawn from this ﬁgure:
– the set of elephants detected during the initial phase (ﬁrst 5 minutes for
the traﬃc traces under consideration) of our algorithm identiﬁes FlowIDs
that exhibit bursty behavior. On close analysis of the traﬃc traces, we found
that this is indeed the case and is due to the fact that such FlowIDs cause
immediate concentration of the probability mass function of the entire traﬃc
sample.
– the proportion of elephants classiﬁed using the frequency of occurrence of
packets (i.e. probability P p
i ) is almost equal in extent to those detected by
considering the volume (bytes) of traﬃc (i.e. probability P b
i ). Notice that,
using the approach of [8], the number of elephants are estimated at around
85 − 90. If the traﬃc traces beyond 5 minutes are considered (not shown in
this study), the approach of [8] exhibits a decreasing trend.
