User: There is an existing web application that needs to be load balanced. Please provide an Nginx-based load balancing solution and describe its working principle.
Assistant: The Nginx-based load balancing solution is as follows: 1. Install Nginx, and add upstream configuration items in the main configuration file to specify the address and weight of the load balancing server. 2. The client accesses the web application through Nginx, and Nginx will send the request to multiple web servers defined by upstream. 3. Nginx assigns requests to different web servers according to load balancing algorithms (such as round robin, IP hash, etc.) to achieve load balancing. 4. If a web server is down or unavailable, Nginx will automatically remove it from the load balancing pool and distribute its requests to other healthy web servers. 5. To achieve a high-availability solution, you can use the keepalive module of Nginx to maintain a long connection, or use the automatic traffic adjustment and fault tolerance mechanism of Nginx Plus. Working principle: Nginx acts as a reverse proxy server. When a client accesses the web server through Nginx, Nginx will distribute the request to multiple web servers defined in the upstream to achieve load balancing. Nginx assigns requests to different web servers according to the load balancing algorithm, usually using polling (each request is sent to each web server in sequence), IP hash (assigned to the specified web server according to the hash value of the request ip), Algorithms such as weights. When a web server is found to be unavailable, Nginx will automatically remove it from the load balancing pool and distribute its requests to other healthy web servers. Implementing load balancing through Nginx can improve the availability and performance of web applications.
