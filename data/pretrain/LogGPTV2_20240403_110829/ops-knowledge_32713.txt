User: I was trying to install Airflow in windows through command prompt using pip. 
The python is 3.4.2, pip included. I am getting the below error.
distutils.errors.DistutilsError: Setup script exited with error: Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 is required (Unable to find vcvarsall.bat).
I have installed Visual studio 2012 but Python 3.4 looks for VS10 by default. I tried to trick Python to use the newer visual studio by 

Executing the command set VS100COMNTOOLS=%VS110COMNTOOLS%. 
Adding new system variable VS100COMNTOOLS as variable name and gave the value as VS110COMNTOOLS.

Both tricks did not work. I am still getting the same old error. 
The file vcvarsall.bat is present in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC
what is missing here? how can I get rid of this error?
Assistant: Instead of setting VS100COMNTOOLS=%VS110COMNTOOLS% in cmd, i did
SET VS100COMNTOOLS=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\Tools\ and it was picking correctly but again thrown another pile of errors as VS11 compiler is different and cannot compile Python 3.4 code properly.
I uninstalled VS11, Installed VS10 and it worked.
