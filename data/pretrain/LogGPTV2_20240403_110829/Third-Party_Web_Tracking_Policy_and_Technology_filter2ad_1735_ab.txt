### Risks and Harms of Third-Party Tracking

Third-party tracking can lead to various adverse outcomes for consumers. These outcomes arise from a combination of four key elements: the actor, the means of access, the action, and the specific harm inflicted.

1. **Actor**: The individual or entity responsible for the harmful action, such as a hacker.
2. **Means of Access**: The method by which the actor gains access to sensitive information, such as breaking into a tracking company's system.
3. **Action**: The specific harmful act, which could include publishing sensitive data, offering less favorable terms, denying benefits, or terminating employment.
4. **Harm**: The type of damage inflicted, which may be physical, psychological, or economic.

The numerous combinations of these variables result in a wide range of potential negative outcomes for consumers. For example, a hacker (actor) might break into a tracking company (means of access) and publish its tracking information (action), leading to the public exposure of an embarrassing fact about the consumer and causing emotional distress (harm).

### Lack of Market Pressure for Security and Privacy

The risks associated with third-party tracking are exacerbated by the lack of market pressure to enforce good security and privacy practices. Unlike first-party websites, where users can choose not to visit untrustworthy sites, consumers often remain unaware of the existence of many third-party websites. This lack of awareness prevents them from rewarding responsible sites and penalizing irresponsible ones. Publishers could potentially advocate for better corporate practices, but they have largely declined to do so.

### User Preferences

User surveys consistently show strong opposition to third-party collection and use of browsing activity. A 2009 representative U.S. phone survey by Turow et al. [33] found that 87% of respondents did not want advertising based on tracking. In a 2010 survey of Amazon Mechanical Turk users by McDonald and Cranor [34], only 45% of respondents were open to seeing ads tailored to their interests. A December 2010 USA Today/Gallup poll [35] reported that 67% of respondents believed behavioral targeting should be illegal. A mid-2011 representative U.S. online survey by TRUSTe and Harris Interactive [36] found that 85% of respondents would not consent to tracking for ad targeting, and 78% would not consent to tracking for website analytics. Finally, a 2012 representative telephone survey by Pew Research [37] found that 68% of respondents were "not okay" with behavioral advertising.

Future research should focus on disaggregating user preferences regarding the collection of tracking data from preferences about specific uses of that data. Additionally, there is a need to examine the economic trade-offs users would make to either be tracked or not.

### Policy Views

Policy views on third-party web tracking vary widely. While all stakeholders agree that consumers should have some control over web tracking, there are significant disagreements on the specifics:

- **Control Over Data**: Many policymakers and advocates believe consumers should have control over the collection of web tracking information, while online advertising trade groups argue that control should extend only to specific uses of data.
- **Default Settings**: EU policymakers advocate for no tracking as the default [38], whereas advertising trade groups support tracking as the default [39].
- **Choice Mechanism Design**: Advertising trade groups prefer to design the choice mechanisms themselves [39], while many policymakers and advocates believe browser vendors should retain this responsibility.

These policy views are influenced by underlying priorities. Some, like consumer advocates and EU policymakers, view online privacy as a fundamental human right. Others, including many researchers and U.S. policymakers, see consumer choice about tracking privacy risks as a means to maximize welfare. Mozilla [40], [41] posits that giving consumers a choice about tracking is itself a policy goal. Third-party websites and advertising trade groups generally defend current practices, arguing that the subsidy to content outweighs consumer privacy risks and aligns with economic rights.

### Regulation and Self-Regulation

Until recently, third-party web tracking has existed in a regulatory vacuum. The following sections detail the limits imposed by U.S. and EU law, as well as the self-regulatory programs of the online advertising industry.

#### United States

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the primary federal agency for consumer protection. The FTC has limited statutory authority, primarily enforcing against "unfair" or "deceptive" business practices under 15 U.S.C. ยง 45. On tracking issues, the FTC typically relies on its deception authority, where a company breaches an express representation made to consumers. First violations are usually settled with a consent order and minimal financial penalties, though subsequent violations can result in significant monetary penalties.

In 2011, the FTC brought three enforcement actions related to third-party web tracking:
- **Chitika**: Offered an opt-out cookie that expired after ten days [42].
- **ScanScout**: Used "Flash cookies" but told users they could prevent tracking by disabling cookies [43].
- **Facebook**: Claimed it would not share personal information with advertisers but leaked user IDs in referrers for ad clicks and third-party applications [44].

The FTC also wields significant soft power, using threats of enforcement, legislative proposals, and public calls for improved practices. Since late 2010, commissioners and staff have consistently called for a Do Not Track mechanism that is universal, usable, persistent, enforceable, and limits data collection [46].

State attorneys general have similar consumer protection authority, but no state has yet brought an enforcement action over tracking-related practices. Civil class action attorneys have attempted to raise federal and state claims, with some companies agreeing to multi-million dollar settlements, while others have won dismissal due to insufficient showing of harm.

#### European Union

The 2002 ePrivacy Directive, 2002/58/EC, mandated that websites enable users to opt out of having information stored in their browser, except as "strictly necessary" to provide service "explicitly requested" by the user. However, this directive had little practical effect, as member states did not enforce compliance and often treated browser cookie settings as adequate implementation.

A 2009 amendment, 2009/136/EC, replaced the opt-out rule with an opt-in requirement. The majority view is that the directive requires explicit, affirmative consent for each third party, and that Do Not Track could satisfy this requirement. This view is supported by the European Commission [56], [57], [58] and the Article 29 Working Party [53], [52], [38]. EU and state authorities have yet to enforce compliance with the amended directive.

In February 2012, the European Commission proposed new revisions to EU data protection law [59], clarifying that consent must be explicit, extending regulations to non-EU companies, and imposing stringent penalties up to 2% of revenue.

#### Online Advertising Self-Regulation

The online advertising industry has harmonized self-regulatory efforts in the U.S. (NAI [60] and DAA [61]) and the EU (IAB Europe [62]). All programs require participating companies to allow users to opt out of behavioral advertising. Participation in self-regulation has fluctuated with government scrutiny. Currently, most large online advertising and analytics companies participate, while smaller ones and social networks and content providers do not.

In late 2011, the DAA announced plans to expand its program to non-advertising businesses and broaden its consumer choice requirement to nearly all uses of third-party data for per-device personalization. Industry enforcement against businesses violating self-regulatory principles has been limited. The Better Business Bureau issued its first "decisions" against companies with defective opt-out mechanisms, requiring them to fix their cookies but not imposing further penalties [66]. The NAI has released annual "Compliance Reports" since 2009 [67], [68], [69], with only one company penalized for non-compliance, required to undergo annual independent privacy audits for three years.

### Business Models and Trends

There are six common business models for third-party websites: advertising companies, analytics services, social networks, content providers, frontend services, and hosting platforms. These models help researchers understand the landscape, though many services span multiple models.

#### Advertising Companies

Online advertising pricing models converged on auction algorithms by the early 2000s, but marketplace structures vary. The main models are direct buy, ad networks, and ad exchanges.

- **Direct Buy**: Advertisers deal directly with first-party websites. This model is dominant for search engine and social network advertising and has seen a resurgence among content publishers due to private advertising exchanges. Direct buy does not raise tracking privacy concerns, especially for search and social network advertising.
- **Advertising Networks**: By the late 1990s, ad networks emerged to facilitate ad placement between advertisers and publishers, enabling demographic, geographic, contextual, and behavioral targeting. They remain the largest intermediaries in online advertising.
- **Advertising Exchanges**: Publishers began using ad exchanges in the mid-2000s to monetize remnant inventory through real-time bidding. Intermediary business models in the exchange ecosystem include demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), yield optimizers, and data providers.

#### Analytics Services

Third-party analytics services provide tools for websites to understand visitor demographics, user agents, and content interactions. Firms like Adobe offer paid services with strict data handling policies, while others, like Quantcast and Google Analytics, offer free services and monetize the collected data for ad targeting and market understanding.

#### Social Integration

Social integration allows websites to offer personalized content and single sign-on to social network users. Major social networks provide widgets for free to increase engagement and conduct market research. Some third-party services, like Disqus, operate on a freemium model, offering advanced functionality to paying customers. Intermediaries like AddThis and ShareThis aggregate social sharing and single sign-on, monetizing through tracking and usage data for ad targeting and market research.
