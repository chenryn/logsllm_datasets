or accidentally distributed. Third, an action that harms the
consumer. The action could be, for example, publication, a
less favorable offer, denial of a beneﬁt, or termination of
employment. Last, a particular harm that is inﬂicted. The
harm might be physical, psychological, or economic.
The countless combinations of these variables result in
countless possible bad outcomes for consumers. To ex-
emplify our thinking, here is one commonly considered
scenario: A hacker (actor) breaks into a tracking company
(means of access) and publishes its tracking information
(action), causing some embarrassing fact about the consumer
to become known and inﬂicting emotional distress (harm).9
Risks associated with third-party tracking are heightened
by the lack of market pressure to exercise good security and
privacy practices. If a ﬁrst-party website is untrustworthy,
users may decline to visit it. But, since users are unaware of
the very existence of many third-party websites, they cannot
reward responsible sites and penalize irresponsible sites.10
D. User Preferences
User surveys have consistently shown opposition to third
parties collecting and using browsing activity. A 2009 rep-
resentative U.S. phone survey by Turow et al. [33] found
that 87% of respondents would not want advertising based
on tracking. In an unrepresentative 2010 survey of Amazon
Mechanical Turk users by McDonald and Cranor [34], only
45% of respondents wanted to be shown any ads that had
been tailored to their interests. A December 2010 USA
Today/Gallup poll [35] reported 67% of respondents thought
behavioral targeting should be outright illegal. In a mid-
2011 representative U.S. online survey by TRUSTe and
Harris Interactive [36], 85% of respondents said they would
not consent
to tracking for ad targeting, and 78% said
they would not consent to tracking for website analytics.
9There has not yet been a reported data breach that involved release of
third-party web tracking data. (Current data breach notiﬁcation laws may
not extend to third-party web tracking information.) Hackers have begun to
target marketing companies; one of the largest data breaches of 2011 was
at Epsilon, an email marketing company [32].
10Publishers could somewhat stand in for users by demanding good
corporate practices, but they have in large measure declined to do so.

Finally, a 2012 representative telephone survey by Pew
Research found that 68% of respondents were “not okay”
with behavioral advertising [37].
One area for future survey work is in disaggregating
user preferences about collection of tracking data from
preferences about speciﬁc uses of tracking data. The survey
literature has largely (but not entirely) focused on behavioral
advertising, which can conﬂate data collection and use.
Another area for future research is preference balancing.
All of the above studies examined user preferences inde-
pendent of economic considerations; there remains a need
for work that more directly examines the economic tradeoffs
users would make to be or not be tracked.
E. Policy Views
Policy views on third-party web tracking vary substan-
tially. All stakeholders agree that consumers should have
some degree of control over web tracking, but there are many
points of disagreement on speciﬁcs.
• What should consumers be able to control? Many poli-
cymakers and advocates believe consumers should have
control over the collection of web tracking information.
Online advertising trade groups have argued that control
should only extend to speciﬁc uses of data.
• What should the default be? EU policymakers believe
no tracking should be the default [38]; advertising trade
groups have argued tracking should be the default [39].
• Who should design the choice mechanism? Advertising
trade groups would like to control choice mechanism
design [39]. Many policymakers and advocates believe
the browser vendors should retain design responsibility.
Views on web tracking policy are, of course, shaded by
underlying priorities. Some, particularly consumer advocates
and EU policymakers, view online privacy as a fundamental
human right. Others, including many researchers and U.S.
policymakers, see consumer choice about tracking privacy
risks as a means to maximize welfare.11 Mozilla [40], [41]
takes the position that giving consumers a choice about
tracking is itself a policy goal. Third-party websites and ad-
vertising trade groups largely defend current practices with
arguments rooted in welfare—that the subsidy to content
outweighs consumer privacy risks—and economic rights.
IV. REGULATION AND SELF-REGULATION
Third-party web tracking has, until recently, largely ex-
isted in a regulatory vacuum. The following subsections
detail limits imposed by U.S. and EU law, as well as the
online advertising industry’s self-regulatory programs.
11We, for example, believe web tracking policy should aim to maximize
welfare by setting a default that maximally satisﬁes aggregate user and
website preferences and enabling bargaining with minimal transaction costs.
A. United States
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the leading
federal regulatory and law enforcement agency for consumer
protection. The FTC has narrowly circumscribed general
statutory authority: it can only prevent business practices
that are either “unfair” or “deceptive” under 15 U.S.C.
§ 45. On tracking issues the agency has generally relied
on its deception authority, where a company breaches an
express representation it has made to consumers.12 The
FTC almost always settles a company’s ﬁrst violation with
a consent order and slight (if any) payment; though not
directly ﬁnancially punitive, business are loath to endure
the expense, burden, and negative publicity of a federal law
enforcement action. A subsequent violation of a consent
order can result in signiﬁcant monetary penalties.
Signaling its heightened interest in the area, the FTC
brought three enforcement actions related to third-party web
tracking in 2011.
• Chitika, a display advertising network, offered an opt-
out cookie that expired after ten days [42].
• ScanScout, an in-video advertising network, used
“Flash cookies” but told users they could prevent track-
ing by disabling cookies [43].
• Facebook claimed that
it would not share personal
it
information about
leaked user IDs in referrers for ad clicks and third-party
applications [44].
its users with advertisers, but
The FTC wields signiﬁcant soft power that complements
its enforcement activity. The agency can threaten enforce-
ment, propose legislation, or publicly call on businesses to
improve their practices. The FTC has been particularly vocal
on web tracking; since late 2010 [45] commissioners and
staff have consistently called for a Do Not Track consumer
choice mechanism that is universal, usable, persistent, en-
forceable, and limits data collection [46] (see Section IX-C).
State attorneys general have consumer protection authority
that largely parallels (and in some states exceeds) the FTC’s.
No attorney general’s ofﬁce has yet brought an enforcement
action over tracking-related practices.13
Civil class action attorneys have attempted to raise a
number of federal and state claims over third-party web
tracking practices. In early litigation, several companies
agreed to multi-million dollar settlements (e.g. [48]). Defen-
dants in many recent suits have won dismissal on insufﬁcient
showing of harm (e.g. [49]).
12The FTC has used its unfairness authority in other privacy contexts.
Enforcement actions for inadequate security precautions that allowed a data
breach, for example, have rested on unfairness.
13State attorneys general have been increasingly scrutinizing online
privacy practices. The Attorney General of California, for example, recently
threatened litigation against mobile application developers that do not
provide a privacy policy as required by the Online Privacy Protection Act,
Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 22575-22579 [47].

In early 2012 the White House released a long-awaited
online privacy report from a policy collaboration with
the Department of Commerce [50]. The report calls for
baseline privacy legislation and Commerce-mediated multi-
stakeholder codes of conduct that are ratiﬁed and enforced
by the FTC. The White House and Commerce Department
have not indicated their proposals would alter the FTC’s
present leadership on web tracking issues, and the Chairman
of the FTC has suggested he shares that view [51].
B. European Union

The 2002 ePrivacy Directive, 2002/58/EC, mandated that
websites enable users to opt out of having information
stored in their browser, except as “strictly necessary” to
provide service “explicitly requested” by the user. In practice
the directive has had little effect; member states have not
taken any measures to enforce compliance, and in many
cases they have treated browser cookie settings as adequate
implementation (see [52]).

[55]). Member state

suggested
existing browser cookie settings would remain adequate,
on the legal theory that they convey “implicit consent.”
The majority view, and the developing consensus, is that
the directive requires explicit, afﬁrmative consent for each
third party, and that Do Not Track (see Section IX-C)
could satisfy the consent requirement of the directive. This
view has been endorsed by leaders in both the European
Commission [56], [57], [58], the EU’s executive branch,
and the Article 29 Working Party [53], [52], [38], a data
protection advisory body. EU and state authorities have yet
to enforce compliance with the amended ePrivacy Directive.
In February 2012 the European Commission proposed
a new set of revisions to EU data protection law [59].
Recommended provisions would clarify that consent must
be explicit, unambiguously extend the reach of regulations
to non-EU companies that track EU residents, and impose
a stringent penalty structure reaching up to 2% of revenue.
C. Online Advertising Self-Regulation
The online advertising industry has largely harmonized
self-regulatory efforts in the U.S. (the Network Advertising
Initiative, NAI [60] and the Digital Advertising Alliance,
DAA [61]) and the EU (the Interactive Advertising Bureau
Europe, IAB Europe [62]). All three programs impose the
same consumer choice requirement: participating companies
must allow users to opt out of behavioral advertising, that
is, ad targeting based on tracking. Note that this is a choice
about one particular use of data; collection and other uses
418
of third-party tracking data are unaffected.14
Participation in self-regulation has ﬂuctuated with waxing
and waning government scrutiny [65]. At present most
of the largest online advertising and analytics companies
participate, and most of the smaller ones do not. Social
networks and content providers are almost entirely absent.
The DAA announced in late 2011 [63] that it would
attempt to expand its program to non-advertising businesses
and that it would broaden its consumer choice requirement to
nearly all uses of third-party data for per-device15 person-
alization. Most of the largest social networks and content
providers were not stakeholders in the DAA’s program
expansion and have not signaled acceptance.
There has been scant industry enforcement against busi-
nesses that violate self-regulatory principles. In late 2011
the Better Business Bureau announced its ﬁrst “decisions”
against companies that had defective opt-out cookie mecha-
nisms (see Section IX-A); the companies ﬁxed their opt-out
cookies, but were not otherwise penalized [66]. The NAI has
released an annual “Compliance Report” since 2009 [67],
[68], [69]. Only one company has been penalized for non-
compliance; it is required to undergo an annual independent
privacy audit for three years.
V. BUSINESS MODELS AND TRENDS
There are, broadly, six common business models for third-
party websites: advertising companies, analytics services,
social networks, content providers, frontend services, and
hosting platforms. This taxonomy is intended to assist re-
searchers in modeling third-party businesses; in practice,
many services cut across business models, and new business
models are frequently attempted.
A. Advertising Companies
While pricing models in online advertising converged by
the early 2000s on a small set of auction algorithms (see
[70], [71]), marketplace structures vary. There are three main
models: direct buy, ad networks, and ad exchanges.
1) Direct Buy: In the oldest model of online advertising,
advertisers (and agencies) cut deals directly with ﬁrst-party
websites (“publishers”). This approach fell into disfavor for
most websites in the late 1990s through 2000s, but remains
the dominant model for search engine and social network
advertising. Direct buy has, of late, experienced a renais-
sance among content publishers owing to the development
of “private advertising exchanges,” real-time advertising auc-
tions run by publishers. Many implementations of direct buy
14The programs impose similar baseline requirements. All three mandate
a modest degree of notice and transparency about behavioral advertising,
reasonable security precautions for behavioral advertising data, and user
consent for behavioral advertising use of narrow classes of sensitive
information. All three also prohibit behavioral targeting speciﬁcally directed
towards children. A recent revision of the DAA principles [63], [64]
prohibits certain particularly sensitive uses of information.
15The DAA has left the door open to per-user content tailoring, such as
personalized social networking widgets [64].

advertising, especially search and social network advertising,
do not load content from third-party websites, and therefore
do not raise tracking privacy concerns.16
2) Advertising Networks: By the late 1990s growth in
advertiser demand and ad slot supply (“inventory”) made it
impractical for advertisers and publishers to deal directly.
Ad networks offered a solution by enabling advertisers to
easily place ads with many publishers, and by allowing
publishers to support their content with many advertisers—
with no ad sales team. Networks also brought the ability to
systematically target ads to users, based on a publisher’s esti-
mated audience (“demographic targeting”), a user’s location
(“geographic targeting”), a web page’s content (“contextual
targeting”), or a user’s browsing history (“behavioral target-
ing”). Ad networks remain the largest and most widely used
intermediaries in online advertising.
3) Advertising Exchanges: In the mid-2000s publishers
began seeking ways to monetize the “remnant” inventory
they were not able to sell
through an ad network. Ad
exchanges offered to ﬁll the slots, in real time, taking bids
from many advertisers via many advertising networks (“real-
time bidding” or “RTB”). Ad exchanges quickly extended
beyond remnants, and a number of intermediary business
models now exist in the exchange ecosystem.
• Demand-side platforms (DSPs), which are replacing ad
networks as “virtual on-ramps” for advertisers to place
bids in multiple ad exchanges.
• Supply-side platforms (SSPs) and yield optimizers,
which assist publishers in strategically making inven-
tory offerings to networks and exchanges so as to
maximize revenue.
• Data providers, which sell ad targeting data to adver-
tisers in real time. Data providers often base their tar-
geting recommendations on tracking (e.g. Quantcast),
information purchased from publishers (e.g. BlueKai),
and ofﬂine consumer databases (e.g. Datalogix).
B. Analytics Services
Third-party analytics services provide tools for websites
to better understand their visitors, including demographics,
user agents, and content views and interactions. While
implementations of analytics can differ signiﬁcantly, nearly
all services have adopted one of two business models. Some
ﬁrms (e.g. Adobe) offer analytics as a paid service; they
disclaim any legal right to access a client’s analytics data
except as directed, and they take technical and business
precautions to silo data between clients (see Section VIII-B).
Other companies offer a free analytics service; they monetize
the data they collect by using it for ad targeting (e.g.
Quantcast), market understanding (e.g. Google Analytics),
and other valuable ends.
16There can be non-tracking privacy issues associated with advertising.
Microtargeting, for example, may allow an advertiser to draw sensitive
inferences about users who click an ad [72].
419
C. Social Integration
Social integration enables websites to offer personalized
content and single sign-on to social network users. The best-
known forms of social integration are provided by ﬁrst-party
social networks, most prominently the Facebook like and
comment widgets, the Twitter tweet and status widgets, and
the Google +1 button. These social networks offer their
widgets for free to increase user engagement and conduct
market research; there has been some discussion of using
social network data for third-party ad targeting [73].
Some social services, such as Disqus, exist almost exclu-
sively in a third-party context. These services tend to operate
on a freemium business model, offering more advanced
functionality to paying website customers.
Various forms of intermediaries have sprung up to assist
websites with social
integration. One common business
model is social sharing aggregation. Services like AddThis,
ShareThis, and Meebo offer free widgets to websites that
enable users to share with dozens of social networks. To
monetize their widgets, the services collect tracking and
usage data and sell it for ad targeting and market research.
Another growing intermediary business model is single
sign-on aggregation. Gigya, for example, facilitates single
