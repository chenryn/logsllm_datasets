the variance is a polynomial of degree 2, set d to 2. From
given ciphertexts E2(pk, Mi) := (Enc(pk, Mi), Enc(pk, M 2
i ))
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, one obtains Enc(pk, Pj(M1,··· , Mn)) =
Pn
i ) for j = 1, 2 using an additive homomor-
phic property. Then we decrypt each ciphertext and obtain
the variance by computing (Variance) = 1
This requires only two decryptions, two integer divisions,
and one squaring operation. From our unoptimized imple-
mentation under the environment described in Section 5, it
takes about 120 µs to compute the variance of 1000 128-bit
integers, and it is quite eﬃcient.

7.3 Secure Computing - Private Set Operations
(Threshold version of) additive homomorphic encryptions
have used in numerous applications for secure computing [16,
19, 22, 33, 31]. Here, we review some of them, in particular,
focus on private set operations [22, 33]. Private set oper-
ations cover private computations such as set intersection,
set union, multi-set intersection, and many others. In par-
ticular, private set operation has received attention since
it can be used as an important primitive in many applica-
tions. There are a lot of private set operation protocols using
public key additive homomorphic encryption, e.g., Paillier
cryptosystem. Such private set operation protocols require
several additions and limited scalar multiplications and our
scheme has advantage over the other scheme in such applica-
tions; for example, there is an approach to represent private
set operation by polynomial operations [22, 33] (rational
function operations, resp. [43]), and one scalar multiplica-
tion is suﬃcient for set intersection in polynomial operation
(set union in rational function operations, resp.).
In these applications, to obtain the ﬁnal result, users re-
cover a set from the resulting polynomial by ﬁnding roots of
the polynomial. The sizes of message spaces of the previous
eﬃcient additive homomorphic encryption are composite or
hidden.
If it is hidden, there is no method to ﬁnd roots
of a polynomial deﬁned over the message space. When it
is composite, the polynomial ring over the message space
is not a unique factorization domain, and hence they can-
not eﬃciently obtain the exact corresponding set from the
polynomial. In particular, the message space of Paillier en-
cryption is ZN for a hard-to-factor integer N . In this case,
296ﬁnding roots of the polynomial in ZN is equivalent to fac-
toring N [44].
To avoid this obstacle, some previous (multi-)set union
protocols [33, 23] hire a mix-net protocol with additive ho-
momorphic encryption, but it additionally causes O(t) rounds
for the number of corrupted users t. Other protocol [43] uti-
lizes a secret sharing technique instead of additive homomor-
phic encryption. It runs in a constant round, but requires nκ
times communicational and n times computational overhead
costs than the previous when n is the number of users and
κ is the cardinality of users’ set. Recently, Cheon et al. [10]
proposed a new encoding to uniquely determine a set from a
polynomial deﬁned over the message space of Naccache and
Stern encryption. However, their encoding is complicated
and supports the correct result only with some probability.
On the other hand, the message space of our scheme can
be a ﬁeld, and hence our scheme enables us to exceed this
obstacle by using some eﬃcient root ﬁnding algorithm over a
ﬁeld [45]. As a result, we can obtain a constant round private
set union protocol which reduces nκ times communicational
and n2 times computational costs than [43].
8. CONCLUSION
We have presented an eﬃcient additive homomorphic en-
cryption scheme and proved the security under the hardness
of a new problem, the co-ACD problem. We could not re-
duce this problem to other well-known cryptographic hard
problems, but extensively analyzed its hardness using all
known techniques. These analyses have provided suﬃciently
plausible evidence of its hardness. Our implementation re-
sults show that our scheme is the fastest scheme of those
that support an additive homomorphic property.
To extend the usefulness of additive homomorphic encryp-
tion, we have presented a method to eﬃciently evaluate sym-
metric polynomials by additionally providing ciphertexts of
some powers of messages. We also have provided a (t, t)-
threshold version of our scheme for smooth adoption to var-
ious applications.
It still remains as an open problem to
construct a (t, n)-threshold version of our scheme for t < n.
