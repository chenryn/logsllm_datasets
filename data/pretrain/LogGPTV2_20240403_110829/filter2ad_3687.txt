ABSTRACT 
In  this  talk,  I  will  talk  about  challenges  and  exciting  new 
opportunities at the intersection of AI and Security, how AI and 
deep  learning  can  enable  better  security,  and  how  Security  can 
enable  better  AI.  In  particular,  I  will  talk  about  secure  deep 
learning and challenges and approaches to ensure the integrity of 
decisions made by deep learning. I will also give an overview on 
challenges  and  new  techniques  to  enable  privacy-preserving 
machine learning. Finally, I will conclude with future directions 
at the intersection of AI and Security.
