FT log ﬁle contains around 3 millions events target-
ing around 26 thousand diﬀerent resources. More than
89% of the events were of severity 0.
Hence, our context has two important characteris-
tics: (a) According to the high sensitivity of our sig-
nature set, we consider that events with a severity 0
are truly safe. (b) As a consequence, a very high rate
of HTTP traﬃc is safe. As a result, WIDS spends an
enormous amount of processing power on traﬃc that
cannot lead to a server compromise.
3. Combining Anomaly and Misuse
Intrusion-detection systems need to be updated pe-
riodically to ensure that they have the latest knowledge
about vulnerabilities. This has the unfortunate side ef-
fect that a web site using an application on which a
script is suddenly tagged vulnerable will incur a large
number of alerts that are triggered by the normal us-
age of the application. Hence, it would be interesting
to ﬁlter out all the known normal usage of web appli-
cations before looking for speciﬁc attacks.
However,

detection system makes the automation of IDS alert

Deﬁnition 1 Safe and intrusive events
Let E be the set of events an IDS processes, Ei be the sub-
set of E that represents the set of truly intrusive events
and Es be the subset of E that represents the set of truly
safe events.
An event cannot be both intrusive and safe, and it
cannot be anything else, we therefore have the follow-
ing property:
Figure 1. Anomaly and misuse detection results rela-
tive to the truly intrusive and safe events
processing diﬃcult. The good thing about misuse de-
tection is that it precisely identify the exploited vul-
nerability. Its relevance to the monitored information
system and the impact of the attack can automati-
cally be assessed, and hence the attack stopped with
little to no human intervention. Therefore, we be-
lieve that combining both anomaly and misuse detec-
tion can eﬀectively provide a technique for mitigating
attacks with as little human intervention as possi-
ble.
In this section we propose a set model to formally de-
scribe anomaly and misuse intrusion detection results.
We ﬁrst deﬁne our notations for each intrusion detec-
tion component, and then we comment the results of
these two components combination. We use here the
classical terminology:
• false positive: false alarm, i.e. alarm raised by an
IDS while the monitored system is not under at-
tack;
• false negative: attack against the monitored sys-
tem that is not detected by the IDS;
• true positive: attack against the monitored system
detected by the IDS;
• true negative: no alert emitted by the IDS when
no attack against the monitored system.
3.1. A Set Model for Intrusion Detection
Results
Intrusion detection component processes events. No
existing component can be considered 100% correct. A
misuse component can for example declare an event in-
trusive, while it is safe. Likewise, an anomaly compo-
nent can declare an event safe while it is intrusive. In
this section, we set deﬁnitions in order to formalize in-
trusion detection results according to the true nature of
processed events. The deﬁnitions are illustrated in Fig-
ure 1.
Property 1 Ei ∪ Es = E and Ei ∩ Es = ∅.
Deﬁnition 2 Anomaly detection diagnosis
Let As (resp. Au) be the subset of E that represents the set
of events declared safe (resp. unknown) by an anomaly
detection.
Deﬁnition 3 Misuse detection diagnosis
Let Mi (resp. Mu) be the subset of E that represents the
set of events declared intrusive (resp. unknown) by a
misuse detection.
Anomaly (resp. misuse) detection is designed to
qualify events as safe or unknown (resp. intrusive or
unknown). So an event cannot be qualiﬁed both safe
and unknown by anomaly (resp. intrusive or unknown
by misuse). Moreover an event cannot be qualiﬁed in
any other way. We therefore have the following prop-
erty:
Property 2 As ∪ Au = E, As ∩ Au = ∅, Mi ∪ Mu = E
and Mi ∩ Mu = ∅.
Since the results of both anomaly and misuse detec-
tions are not perfect, we have to deﬁne their correct
results and their mistakes.

3.2. Resolving Conﬂicts
Using both anomaly and misuse intrusion detection
combines the advantages of each approach, intuitively
leading to a better qualiﬁcation of the results.
A combination, however, implies possible conﬂicts
between the two detectors. We list all the possible cases
in the following using deﬁnitions and notations intro-
duced in Section 3.1. We start with the cases where
anomaly and misuse agree. Then, we list the actual
conﬂicts and discuss when components are correct. The
diﬀerent cases are illustrated on Figure 2. When a com-
ponent is correct while the other is not we denote it
with >>. For example, M >> A means that for the
given conﬂict misuse is correct while anomaly is not.
When the events are qualiﬁed by none of the com-
ponents, the conﬂicts are somewhat softer than when
at least one component qualiﬁes the events. In that
case, we only say that one component is more accu-
rate than the other, and we denote it with >. For ex-
ample, M > A means that for the given conﬂict misuse
is more accurate than anomaly.
